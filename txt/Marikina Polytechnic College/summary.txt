D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the review/examination of the accounts and operations of the 
MPC for CY 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) ascertain the level of assurance that 
may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the 
propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules 
and regulations; and (c) determine the extent of implementations of prior years’ audit 
recommendations. 

 
E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 

 
The Auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of 

the financial statements of the MPC for CY 2020 as stated in the Independent Auditor’s 
Report in Part I and as discussed in Part II of this Report.  
 
F. Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 
 The following are among the significant audit observations and recommendations, 
which were discussed in detail in Part II – Observations and Recommendations of this 
Report: 
 
1. The Advances for Payroll and Trust Liabilities accounts have misstatements totaling 

P1,282,035.21, which represents 0.27 percent of its total Assets of P474,574,976.10 
as at December 31, 2020 and is lower than the established materiality threshold of 
P1,529,897.25 or one percent of the total Expenses balance for an expense-driven 
entity, thus with insignificant impact on the fair presentation of the Financial 
Statements of MPC. (Observation No. 1) 
 
We recommended that Management, thru the Accountant, prepare the 
necessary adjusting journal entries, to correct and adjust the above 
misstatements to reflect the accurate balances of the affected accounts. 
 

2. The aggregate balance of the Due from NGAs, Advances and Property, Plant and Equipment 
(PPE) accounts totaling P276,919,691.70 as of December 31, 2020 is of doubtful validity due 
to accounting and property control deficiencies. (Observation No. 2) 
 
We recommended that Management: 

 
       For Due to NGAs 
 

a. prioritize  the reconciliation of the advances  made to DBM-PS  and 
strengthen the coordination with that agency  to ensure equality of balances 
between the records of MPC and the DBM-PS Party Ledger card; 

 
b. consider as initial basis in the preparation of necessary adjusting entries to 

the account  the proposed reconciliation statement made by the Audit Team 



v 
 

and communicate to the DBM-PS the errors attributable to them within one 
month from receipt hereof;  

 
c. require the Accountant to present/submit to the Audit Team the SLs and 

supporting documents to the entries and adjustments made;  
 
For Advances 

 
d. strictly comply with COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 in 

granting and utilization of cash advances,   send demand letters to the AOs 
and/or  exhaust all remedies for the settlement of unliquidated cash 
advances   by withholding their salaries or any amount due them,   to avoid 
accumulation of unsettled/unliquidated cash advance balance at year-end;  

 
e. exert efforts to analyze  and document the details of the dormant  accounts 

and following the procedures stated in  COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated 
December 19, 2016,  request from COA for the write-off of dormant 
accounts;  

 
For Property, Plant and Equipment 
 
f. refer to the COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 for the 

guidelines and procedures on the conduct of physical count of PPE, 
recognition of PPE items found at station, and disposition for non-
existing/missing PPE items to aid the one-time cleansing of PPE account 
balances; 

 
g. exert efforts and ask the assistance of Accounting Unit to determine the 

value of items in the RPCPPE that were reported as “No Available Value”; 
 

h. prepare the IIRUP, thru the Property Officer, using the prescribed format 
for all properties that are unserviceable, obsolete or no longer needed due to 
its defectiveness and conduct disposal to avoid deterioration and possible 
loss of value. Moreover, furnish a copy thereof to the Accounting Division as 
their basis in the dropping from the books of all unserviceable PPEs; and  

 
i. regularly reconcile Accounting and Property records, thru the Accountant 

and Property Officer, to arrive at the reliable and accurate balances of PPE 
accounts for the fair presentation in the financial statements.  

 
3. Out of the MPC’s Budget allocation for Fund 164 of P138,288,616.50, only 

P29,514,598.96 or 21.34 percent were utilized, leaving P108,774,017.54 or 78.66 
percent as unutilized amount, thereby adversely affecting the effective and efficient 
delivery of Programs/Projects and Activities (PPAs) consistent with the trifocal 
functions of the College. Meanwhile, Utilization Report for Fiduciary Fund does not 
correspond with specific budget allocations per thrust/program/activities, thus, 



vi 
 

utilization cannot be ascertained if made solely for the purpose it was collected. 
(Observation No. 3) 

 
We recommended that Management: 

 
a. develop a catch up plan to maximize the utilization of the approved budget 

for STF or Fund 164 for effective and efficient delivery of MPC’s PPAs and 
to ensure accomplishment of the College major functions which are 
instruction, research and extension services; 

 
b. submit justification on the low utilization rate of Fiduciary Fund, and 

consider assessing possible reductions on Fiduciary Fees collected, where 
appropriate; 

 
c. observe set timelines in the implementation and completion of 

plans/programs and activities, to ensure effective delivery of services and to 
address the needs of the students and other stakeholders, as required under 
Section 24 of the CMO; and 

 
d. prepare and submit Utilization Report with specific budget allocations per 

thrust/program/activities in conformity with line item requirements specified 
in the CMO No. 20 series of 2011.  

 
The aforementioned audit observations and recommendations were discussed with 

Agency officials in an Exit Conference via Zoom conducted on May 10, 2021 and their 
comments were included in this Report, where appropriate. 
 
G. Status of Settlement of Audit Suspensions and Disallowances 
 

As of December 31, 2020, MPC had a total unsettled disallowances of 
P282,250.04. 
 
H. Status of Implementations of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations 

 
Out of the 74 prior years’ audit recommendations, 29 were fully implemented 

while 45 remained unimplemented, as summarized in the table below, the details of 
which are shown in Part III of this report.
