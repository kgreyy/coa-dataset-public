PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 
  
Accounting Errors and Omissions 
 
1. The Advances for Payroll and Trust Liabilities accounts have misstatements 

totaling P1,282,035.21, which represents 0.27 percent of its total Assets of 
P474,574,976.10 as at December 31, 2020 and is lower than the established 
materiality threshold of P1,529,897.25 or one percent of the total Expenses 
balance for an expense-driven entity, thus with insignificant impact on the 
fair presentation of the financial statements (FS) of MPC.  

 
1.1. Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 

1 and Section 15, Chapter 1 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) 
for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I state that “The FS 
shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash 
flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of 
the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with 
the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and 
expenses set out in PPSAS1.” 

 
1.2. Moreover, Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 

require agencies to keep the accounts in such detail as necessary to meet the 
needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the 
information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government; and that 
the highest standard of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be 
observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or 
misleading information. Each government agency shall record its financial 
transactions and operations conformably with IPSAS and in accordance with 
pertinent laws and regulations. 

 
1.3. Our audit of the various accounts of the MPC disclosed errors and omissions 

in several of its accounts in the financial statements totaling P1,282,035.21 
as shown below:

Misstatements below Materiality Threshold by 247,862.04 

 
1.4. In summary, total misstatements affecting the aforesaid six accounts which 

were not adjusted in the books of MPC during the audit period amounted to 
P1,282,035.21. This amount does not exceed the established materiality 
threshold of P1,529,897.25 or one percent of the total expenses for an 
expense-driven entity; hence,  in view of their  insignificant impact to the 
accuracy, existence, classification and completeness assertions on the 
reported balances of affected accounts, the Audit Team rendered an 
unqualified opinion on the FSs of  MPC. 

 
1.5. The details of accounting errors and omissions are as follows: 

 
a.) Double recording of liquidations understated the Advances for 

Payroll Account by P727,411.02 and overstated Liabilities and 
Various Expenses Accounts by P19,899.08 and P747,310.10, 
respectively 

 
1.6. Records showed that liquidations amounting to P727,411.02 for cash 

advances for payroll granted and liquidated in CY 2019, which  were already 
recorded in the same year, were again recorded in CY 2020, thus double 
recording of liquidations, details are as follows:

b.) Proceeds from sale of bid documents amounting to P554,624.19 were 
improperly recorded as Guarantee Income, hence overstating the 
Income and the Accumulated Surplus/ (Deficit) accounts by 
P179,663.96 and P374,960.23, respectively, while understating the 
Trust Liabilities account by  P554,624.19. 

 
1.8. Analysis of the College’s financial statements for CYs 2017 to 2019 revealed 

that the proceeds from the sale of bid documents amounting to P374,960.23 
were reported as Guarantee Income and formed as part of the College’s 
business income. Further, in its Statement of Financial Performance for the 
quarter ending September 30, 2020, the College has reported a total amount 
of P179,663.96, representing collections from the sale of bid documents.  

 
1.9. Management informed the Audit Team that proceeds from sale of bid 

documents were used to pay the Honoraria of Bids and Awards Committee 
(BAC). However, records showed that such proceeds were improperly 
recorded as Guarantee Income instead of Trust Liabilities.  

 



55 
 

1.10. Due to Management’s practice of recording collections of sale of bid 
documents as Guarantee Income, the Income and Accumulated Surplus / 
(Deficit) accounts were overstated by the amounts of P179,663.96 and 
P374,960.23, respectively, while the corresponding Trust Liabilities account 
was understated by  P554,624.19. 

 
1.11. The effects of the misclassification of the aforementioned collections in the 

financial statements are summarized below:

1.12. We recommended that Management, thru the Accountant, prepare the 

necessary adjusting journal entries, to correct and adjust the above 
misstatements to reflect the accurate balances of the affected accounts. 
 

1.13. Management commented that entries were drawn to correct the errors 
reported. 
 

OTHER ACCOUNTING DEFICIENCIES 
 
Accounting and Property Control Deficiencies 
 
2. The aggregate balance of the Due from NGAs, Advances and Property, Plant 

and Equipment (PPE) accounts totaling P276,919,691.70 as of December 31, 
2020 is of doubtful validity due to accounting and property control 
deficiencies. 
 

 
2.1 Section 4, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, on Financial 

Reporting, provides that the "Responsibility for the fair presentation and 
reliability of financial statements rests with the management of the reporting 
agency, particularly the head of finance/accounting office and the head of 
entity or his authorized representative.” 

 



56 
 

2.2 Reliability means that reliable information is free from material error and 
bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it 
purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent; while, 
Faithful representation means that for information to represent faithfully 
transactions and other events, it should be presented in accordance with the 
substance of the transactions and other events, and not merely their legal 
form. (Section 6, Chapter 19, GAM for NGAs, Volume I) 

 
2.3 Audit of the various Assets accounts of the College disclosed various 

accounting and property control deficiencies in several of the accounts, as 
follows:

57 
 

Details of Accounting and Property Control Deficiencies: 
 

DUE FROM NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES 
 

a. absence of periodic reconciliation of records between the agency and 
DBM-PS 

 
2.4 The MPC has been procuring its commonly-used supplies, materials and 

equipment from the DBM-PS in line with the national policy that 
procurement of government supplies, materials and equipment shall be done 
in the most economical and efficient manner. The procurement of said 
operational requirements from the DBM-PS was effected thru advance 
payment based on the Agency Procurement Request (APR) and recorded as 
Due from NGAs in the MPC’s books of accounts.  
 

2.5 Statement of Account from the DBM-PS shows that the MPC has a balance 
of ₱61,408.28 as of December 31, 2020 as against the MPC’s book balance 
of P543,873.85, presenting a difference of ₱482,465.57. 

 
2.6 It was noted that the existence of discrepancy and accumulation of errors 

was due to the absence of any action from the Management to reconcile their 
records with the DBM-PS Ledger Card.  

 
2.7 Analysis of fund transfers to DBM-PS and the results of the confirmation for 

CYs 2015-2020 showed the following discrepancies: 
 

Table 6. Fund Transfers to DBM-PS and Confirmation Results 

Year

Difference 
(In Pesos) 

2015 543,822.83 860,724.57 -316,901.74 -58% 
2016 63,937.08 644,702.38 -580,765.30 -908% 
2017 1,090,903.55 714,048.15 376,855.40 35% 
2018 241,053.49 78,420.22 162,633.27 67% 
2019 395,329.01 61,408.02 333,920.99 84% 
2020 543,873.85 61,408.28 482,465.57 89% 

 
2.8 The above information showed that, throughout the years, MPC and DBM-

PS had not reconciled the significant difference in their records, resulting in 
unreconciled balance yearly. 

 
 
 
 



58 
 

b. Deficiencies noted in the previous years’ audit were not yet 
corrected/communicated to the DBM-PS 

 
2.9 The unaccounted and unreconciled balance of the account Due from NGAs 

(DBM-PS) had been brought to Management’s attention in the previous 
Annual Audit Reports, with proposed reconciliation based on the errors 
found in audit of transactions covering the period CYs 2015-2018. 

 
2.10 The errors found in the reconciliation made by the Audit Team included both 

errors on the part of the MPC and DBM-PS. It was recommended that 
Management require the Accountant to prepare the necessary adjusting 
journal entries to correct the account balance and communicate with the 
DBM-PS the identified errors attributable to them so they can also make the 
necessary adjustments in their record.  

 
2.11 It was noted that the said errors still exist both in MPC and DBM-PS records 

and no proof of communication made with the DBM-PS were submitted to 
the Audit Team, thus balances between two records remain unreconciled. 

 
c. Non-submission of SLs and other supporting documents 

 
2.12 Meanwhile, the Management failed to present the SLs and submit other 

supporting documents to the Audit Team, thus the Audit Team has no basis 
to check the validity and accuracy of the transactions and entries made to the 
Due from NGAs account. 

 
2.13 We recommended that Management: 

 
a. prioritize the reconciliation of the advances  made to DBM-PS  and 

strengthen the coordination with that agency  to ensure equality of 
balances between the records of MPC and the DBM-PS Party 
Ledger Card; 

 
b. consider as initial basis in the preparation of necessary adjusting 

entries to the account  the proposed reconciliation statement made 
by the Audit Team and communicate to the DBM-PS the errors 
attributable to them within one month from receipt hereof; and 

 
c. require the Accountant to present/submit to the Audit Team the SLs 

and supporting documents to the entries and adjustments made.  
 
2.14 Management commented that they will create a Reconciliation Committee 

that will verify, investigate and reconcile the deficiencies noted. 
 
 
 



59 
 

ADVANCES 
 

d. Accumulation of unsettled/unliquidated cash advance balance at 
yearend – P4,500,410.02 

 
2.15 COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides the rules and 

regulations regarding the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash 
advances, as follows:   

 
4.1.3 A cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the purpose for which 
it was  given has been served. xxx 

 
5.7 When a CA is no longer needed or has not been used for a period of 
two months, it must be returned or refunded immediately to the Collecting 
Officer. 

 
5.8 All CA shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year.  Except for 
petty cash  fund (PCF), the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the 
Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipt. 

 
2.16 The same circular requires the AO to liquidate his cash advances as follows: 
 

5.1.1 Salaries, Wages, etc. - within five (5) days after each fifteen (15) 
day/end of the  month pay period. 

 
5.1.2 Petty Operating Expenses and Field Operating Expenses - within 
twenty (20)  days after the end of the year; subject to replenishment as 
frequently as necessary  during the year. 

 
5.1.3 Official Travel - within sixty (60) days after return to the Philippines 
in the case  of foreign travel or within thirty (30) days after return to his 
permanent official station  in the case of local travel, as provided for in EO 
248 and COA Circular No. 96-004. 

 
2.17 Meanwhile, Section 15 Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual 

(GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, states that: 
 

Advances for Payroll shall be granted to Regular Officers for payment of 
salaries, wages, honoraria, allowances and other personnel benefits of 
officials and employees. Liquidation of the advances shall be within five 
(5) days after the end of the pay period.  Any unclaimed salaries/ 
allowances shall be refunded and issued official receipt to close the 
account.  

 
2.18 The legal presumption against non-liquidation of cash advances is provided 

by Articles 217 and 218 of the Revised Penal Code as quoted hereunder: 



60 
 

The failure of a public officer to have duly forthcoming any public funds or 
property with which he is chargeable, upon demand by any duly authorized 
officer, shall be prima facie evidence that he has put such missing funds or 
property to personal use.  

 
Any public officer, whether in the service or separated therefrom by 
resignation or  any other cause, who is required by law or regulation to 
render account to the Insular  Auditor, or to a provincial auditor and who 
fails to do so for a period of two months after such accounts should be 
rendered, shall be punished by prison correctional in its minimum period, 
or by a fine ranging from 200 to 6,000 pesos, or both.  

 
2.19 The above-cited rules and regulations were formulated to provide clear and 

extensive guidelines for an effective and efficient control in the granting, 
utilization and liquidation of cash advances. However, these were not strictly 
observed and implemented as can be gleaned from the reports and records 
submitted by the Management.  This is a reiteration of the previous 
observation on the cash advances. 

 
2.20 The unliquidated Advances for Payroll, Advances to Special Disbursing 

Officer and Advances to Officers and Employees accounts as reflected in the 
financial statement of MPC as of December 31, 2020 amounted to                          
P 4,500,410.02, broken down as follows: 

 
Table 7. Advances as of December 31, 2020 
Accounts Balance (In Pesos) 

Advances for Payroll 1,689,927.96 
Advances to Special Disbursing Officer 2,364,911.58 
Advances to Officers and Employees 445,570.48 
 Total Advances 4,500,410.02 
 

2.21 It is the responsibility of the Head of the Agency to ensure the proper 
granting, and utilization of all cash advances in accordance with the set rules 
and regulations. To strengthen internal control, rules and regulation in the 
grant, utilization, and liquidation of cash advances, Management shall take 
appropriate action and exhaust all remedies and /or demand for settlement 
thereof.  

 
2.22 The failure of Management to strictly monitor and properly account the 

granting and liquidation of cash advances of the accountable officers (AOs) 
caused the accumulation of the balances that affects the fair presentation of 
accounts in the submitted FSs, casting doubt on the validity and accuracy of 
the reported balances in the submitted FSs of the agency, thus affecting the 
fair presentation of the accounts in the College’s FS. 

 



61 
 

2.23 The failure of the concerned AOs to liquidate/refund the unsettled accounts 
overstated the Asset accounts and understated the Expense accounts as well. 

 
e. Existence of Unaccounted Book Balances- P318,198.21 

 
2.24 COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 05, 1997 prescribes the guidelines 

on the proper disposition/closure of dormant accounts. Item 10 thereof 
provides that:   

 
10.  If the analysis/review of the accounts/funds is not possible due to 

absence of records and documents, the agency head concerned 
should request for write-off and/or adjustment of account balances 
from the COA, supported by:  

 
10.1 List of available records and extent of validation made on the 

accounts; and 
 

10.2 Certification and reasons why the books of accounts/records, 
financial statements/schedules and supporting vouchers/ 
documents cannot be located.  

 
2.25 Section 7.1 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 also 

provides that: 
 
The Accountant shall: 
 
7.1 Conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis, and validation of the 
existence of the receivables, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers, 
and determine the concerned debtors, accountable officers (Regular and 
Special Disbursing Officers, Collecting Officers and Cashiers) and the 
source and implementing government entities. 

 
2.26 Audit of the Advances accounts revealed that prior’s years balances for both 

STF and MDS funds totaling P318,198.21 remained unaccounted and 
dormant as names/payees and nature of these advances are unknown and 
amounts were lumped in the report and carried forward yearly  in the 
College’s books as shown below: 

 
Table 8. Unaccounted Balance

Total    202,869.05  115,329.16  318,198.21  
 



62 
 

2.27 This audit observation was noted since CY 2014 but to date, no 
reconciliation and necessary adjustments were made and recording of the 
same were not yet effected in the books as of December 31, 2020.  

 
2.28 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. strictly comply with COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 
1997 in granting and utilization of cash advances,   send demand 
letters to the AOs and/or  exhaust all remedies for the settlement of 
unliquidated cash advances   by withholding their salaries or any 
amount due them,   to avoid accumulation of unsettled/unliquidated 
cash advance balance at yearend; and 

 
b. exert efforts to analyze  and document the details of the dormant  

accounts and following the procedures stated in  COA Circular No. 
2016-005 dated December 19, 2016,  request from COA for the write-
off of dormant accounts.  

 
2.29 Management commented that some of the liquidation reports were already 

submitted while some are still being checked for completeness by the 
Accounting personnel concerned. 

 
PROPERTY, PLANT and EQUIPMENT 

 
f. Non-reconciliation of Records between the Accounting and Property 

Offices 
 

2.30 Chapter 10, Section 4 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states the criteria 
for recognition of PPE, as follows: 

 
• It is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential 

associated with the item will flow to the entity 
• The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably; 
• Beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the government; 
• The asset is used to achieve government objectives; and 
• It meets the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 

 
2.31 Likewise Section 42 of the same Chapter enumerated the Accounting and 

Property records to be maintained for PPE, which includes the RPCPPE. 
 

Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) 
– shall be used to report the physical count and condition of PPE by the type 
as at a given date, including those which are unrecorded and those which 
could not be accounted for. It shows the balance of PPE per Property Cards 
and per count and the shortage/overage, if any. It shall be rendered by the 



63 
 

Inventory Committee, on its yearly physical count of properties owned by

2.34 The unreconciled difference of ₱31,299,697.10 above is substantial that 
needs to be addressed both by the Accounting and Property Sections. It was 
noted that this non-reconciliation of Accounting and Property records on 
PPE accounts had been the subject of our prior year’s observations. As 
discussed in Paragraph 2.42, the discrepancies between the two records were 
due to the costs of 273 PPE items which were not properly valued  in the 
RPCPPE and were just remarked as “No Available Value” in the report 
which understated the RPCPPE balance of the affected PPE class.  
 

2.35 The continuous failure of the Property and Accounting Sections to reconcile 
their respective reports had caused the unreliability of the reported PPE 
balances in the FS that affects the fair presentation of the Financial Position 
of the College. 

 
2.36 To aid the government agencies in coming up with  accurate and reliable 

PPE account balances, the Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2020-
006 dated January 31, 2020 provides the guidelines and procedures for the 
conduct of physical count of PPE, recognition of PPE items found at station, 
and disposition for non-existing/missing PPE items, for the One-Time 
Cleansing of PPE Account balances of Government Agencies. 

 
2.37 The said Circular has set the following general guidelines on the One-Time 

Cleansing of PPE Account balances of Government Agencies, as follows: 
 

5.1 Each government agency shall conduct physical count of all its PPE, 
whether  acquired through purchase or donation, including those 
constructed by administration and found at station. 

 



65 
 

5.2 The Head of the Agency shall create an Inventory Committee 
composed of adequate number of members to be able to complete the 
physical inventory in three months or less. The Inventory Committee 
shall have at least one member each from the Accounting and 
Property Divisions/Units of the agency.  

 
5.3 The members of the Inventory Committee shall be temporarily 

relieved of all their regular duties to devote their full time in the 
conduct of the physical inventory- taking until the same is 
completed. 

 
5.4 The entire inventory-taking shall be witnessed by the Commission on 

Audit (COA) Auditor. The Audit Team Leader and/or any of his/her 
Audit Team Members may be assigned for the purpose. 

 
5.5 Head of the Agency may also require a representative from the 

agency's Audit Service/Unit to witness the inventory-taking. 
 

2.38 Further, the said Circular also states that: 
 

5.6 The Inventory Committee shall be responsible for the actual count to 
ascertain the existence, completeness and condition of all PPEs 
owned by the government agency. 

 
5.7 Property records shall be updated based on the results of the physical 

inventory and reconciled with Accounting records to come up with 
the reconciled  balances of PPE accounts to be considered as the 
correct balance of the agency’s PPEs.  

 
g. Inclusion of Unserviceable and Damaged PPEs in the RPCPPE 

 
2.39 Section 40, Chapter 10, of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I sets the policies on 

idle, unserviceable and fully depreciated PPE, as follows: 
 

a. Temporary idle activity or abandonment of PPE does not preclude 
depreciating the asset, as future benefits are consumed not only through 
usage but also through obsolescence, and wear and tear. 
  

b. A PPE is said to be fully depreciated when the carrying amount is equal 
to zero or residual value. The cost of fully depreciated assets remaining 
in service and the related accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses shall not be removed from the accounts. 

 
c. A PPE is said to be unserviceable if it is no longer capable of providing 

the entity with future economic benefits or service potential. 
 



66 
 

d. All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and 
Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74). 
PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting 
Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less 
Accumulated Depreciation). 

 
2.40 Examination of the submitted RPCPPE showed that some PPEs were 

remarked as unserviceable and/or damaged. 
 

a.) Seven items under the transportation equipment were unserviceable and 
have no available value, to wit:

b.) Two Information Technology Equipment with reported cost amounting 

to P49,735.00, damaged by typhoon, were still included in the RPCPPE 
as follows:

 Total     49,735.00 
 

h. PPE costs not properly established/assigned in the RPCPPE 
 

2.41 The procedural guidelines on inventory-taking of COA Circular No. 2020-
006 dated January 31, 2020 provide that: 

  
6.2.11 the unit value of articles/items counted shall be taken from the 

PPELCs/Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) or, if not available, from 
Property Cards or other property records. 



67 
 

6.2.12 In case no such information could be found in both Accounting 
Property records such as for PPEs items found at station, the unit 
cost/value shall be established, as follows: 

 
a. Cost/value may be assigned by the Inventory Committee based 

on the market/fair value of the item. The cost/value of a similar 
item in the RPCPPE may also be used by the Inventory 
Committee. 

 
The market value is the estimated amount for which an asset 
could be  exchanged on the date of valuation, between 
knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length transactions, 
and 

 
b. If there are items for which market/fair value could not be easily 

determined by the Inventory Committee, their fair value shall be 
determined by appraisal. 

 
An appraisal of the value of asset is normally undertaken by a 
member of the valuation profession who holds a recognized and 
relevant qualification. 

 
2.42 Moreover, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that:  

 
Section 12. Donation without Condition. Cost of PPE acquired 
through donation without condition shall be taken up at its fair value at 
the date it is acquired.  All expenses incurred in connection with the 
donated asset, such as delivery and  installation costs, shall be 
included in the amount recognized as asset. The fair value of the PPE 
shall be recognized as “Income from Grants and Donations in Kind.” 

 
Section 13. Donation with Condition. Where a PPE is acquired 
through donation  with conditions or restrictions, a liability account 
shall be recognized until conditions or restrictions have been fulfilled. 

 
2.43 Examination revealed that cost of 273 PPE items were not properly valued in 

the RPCPPE and were just remarked as “No Available Value” in the report 
which understated the RPCPPE balance of the affected PPE class, to wit:

2.45 All the circumstances discussed above affect the accuracy, reliability and fair 
presentation of the reported PPE account balances amounting to 
P271,875,407.83 as of December 31, 2020.   

 
2.46 We recommended that Management: 

 
a. refer to the COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 for 

the guidelines and procedures on the conduct of the physical count of 
PPE, recognition of PPE items found at station, and disposition for 
non-existing/missing PPE items to aid the one-time cleansing of PPE 
account balances; 
 

b. exert efforts and ask the assistance of Accounting Unit to determine 
the value of items in the RPCPPE that were reported as “No 
Available Value”; 

 
c. prepare the IIRUP, thru the Property Officer, using the prescribed 

format for all properties that are unserviceable, obsolete or no 
longer needed due to its defectiveness and conduct disposal to avoid 
deterioration and possible loss of value. Moreover, furnish a copy 
thereof to the Accounting Division as their basis in the dropping 
from the books of all unserviceable PPEs; and  

 
d. regularly reconcile Accounting and Property records, thru the 

Accountant and Property Officer, to arrive at the reliable and 



69 
 

accurate balances of PPE accounts for the fair presentation in the 
financial statements.  

 
2.47 Management commented that they will apply the guidelines provided under 

Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 
for the guidelines and procedures for a one-time cleansing and reconciliation 
of PPE account balances, and thereafter, regular reconciliation shall be 
performed. 

 
 
COMPLIANCE AUDIT 
 
Special Trust Fund (STF) Allocation, Utilization and Disbursements 
 
3. Out of the MPC’s Budget allocation for Fund 164 of P138,288,616.50, only 

P29,514,598.96 or 21.34 percent were utilized, leaving P108,774,017.54 or 
78.66 percent as unutilized amount, thereby adversely affecting the effective 
and efficient delivery of Programs/Projects and Activities (PPAs) consistent 
with the trifocal functions of the College. Meanwhile, Utilization Report for 
Fiduciary Fund does not correspond with specific budget allocations per 
thrust/program/activities, thus utilization cannot be ascertained if made solely 
for the purpose it was collected. 
 
3.1 Section 4 (d) of RA No. 8292 or the Higher Education Modernization Act of 

1997 provides that: 
 
Any income generated by the university or college from tuition fees and 
other charges, as well as from the operation of auxiliary services and 
land grants, shall be retained by the university or college, and may be 
disbursed by the Board of Regents/Trustees (BOR/T) for instruction, 
research, extension, or other programs/projects of the university or 
college. Provided, that all fiduciary fees shall be disbursed for the 
specific purposes for which they are collected.  

 
3.2 CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 20, Series of 2011 has been issued 

to establish and institutionalize uniform fiscal policies that will serve as 
guidelines on the use and disposition of all internally generated funds 
accruing to the State University/College (SUC), as well as to integrate a 
system of accountability for all fund administrators. It defines STF as 
referring to the income of the SUC arising from collection of tuition fees, 
miscellaneous fees, service and other income, which is broken down into: 

 
a) Tuition fees for the use by the SUC in carrying out its trifocal function: 

instruction, research and extension, and production, as well as defray 
its administrative costs (general administrative support); 

b) Fiduciary Fund; 



70 
 

c) Revenues collected by self-liquidating units; 
d) Revenues generated by IGUs; 
e) Regular Trust Fund without separate depository account (NSTP, 

ROTC, NEDA, DOST Funding, or other NGA Funding for the 
implementation of projects through the State College). 

 
3.3 Section 24 thereof states that the budget authorized by the BOR shall be 

implemented within the CY for which it was formulated. The inclusive 
collection period and the Quarter for which the collection will be used shall 
be clearly and specifically stated. The BOR regularly meets only once every 
quarter, and is allowed to conduct special meetings whenever necessary. 
Therefore, a reasonable scheme must be resorted to in order to abide with 
COA Circular No. 2000-002 dated April 4, 2000, which requires board 
approval for the use of income, while aligning the financial operations and 
transactions with the financial cycle which abides by a January to December 
or the CY period. 

 
3.4 Submitted report of the MPC showed that as of November 2019, STF 

accumulated income collections available in the bank (net of reserve fund) 
amounted to P140,850,691.45. The said amount is the basis of the MPC in 
creating their operating budget for CY 2020. However, due to some 
discontinued projects caused by the Pandemic, a reduction of P2,562,075.00 
was made to the initial Program of Receipts and Expenditures (PRE). 

 
3.5 On May 13, 2020, thru Skype Meeting, the BOT approved the MPC’s PRE 

for 2020 with an adjusted budget of P138,288,616.50 (net of reserve fund) 
for personnel services, maintenance and other operating expenses, capital 
outlay, fiduciary fees, research and extension projects/activities. Details are

3.8 Based on the foregoing table, out of P29,138,657.98 budgeted for STF for 
CY 2020, P4,229,508.80 or 14.52 percent was utilized, leaving 
P24,909,149.18 or 85.48 percent unutilized. For SUC-Wide Common Fund, 
none was utilized. The minimal utilization affected the effective and efficient 
delivery of programs, projects and activities consistent with the trifocal 
functions of the MPC on instruction, research and extension, and production. 

 
3.9 Utilization Report submitted also showed low utilization of Fiduciary Fund, 

which amounted to P4,607,839.68 or 16.16 percent of the approved budget 
of P28,519,041.27, leaving an unutilized amount of P23,911,201.59 or 83.84

3.10 The Fiduciary Fund includes fees assessed and collected from students 

intended for specific purpose such as cultural, medical/dental, sports 
development, laboratory, library, guidance, and IT fees. As defined in the 
CMO, this fund shall be used solely for the purpose for which it was 
authorized to be collected. The listing of what is classified as Fiduciary 
Fund, as well as the college, office, or unit accountable for its utilization 
shall be stated in the Report of Collections which is submitted to the BOR 
for approval.  

 
3.11 The above Utilization Report did not conform to the line item requirements 

specified in the CMO No. 20 and does not correspond with the specific 
budget allocations per thrust/program/activities, thus utilization cannot be 
ascertained if made solely for its specific purpose.  On January 25, 2021, the 
Audit Team requested for a separate Utilization Report based on the line 
item as enumerated in Chapter III of the CMO, and followed it up with 
Management for several times but no report was submitted to date. While it 
is true that SUCs are authorized to collect Fiduciary Fees from students 
every semester, we believe that these should be utilized as intended in order 
to address the needs of the students. 

 
3.12 The low utilization rate and unutilized balances of MPC imply that the 

Management did not ensure effective delivery of services to its students from 
its collection, hence further resulting in the accumulation of the amounts 
maintained in the AGDB. This is in contravention of Section 24 of CMO No. 
20, series of 2011, which states that the budget authorized by the BOR shall 
be implemented within the CY for which it was formulated. 

 
3.13 We recommended that Management: 

 
a. develop a catch up plan to maximize the utilization of the approved 

budget for STF or Fund 164 for effective and efficient delivery of 
MPC’s PPAs and to ensure accomplishment of the College major 
functions which are instruction, research and extension services; 

 



74 
 

b. submit justification on the low utilization rate of Fiduciary Fund, 
and consider assessing possible reductions on Fiduciary Fees 
collected, where appropriate; 

 
c. observe set timelines in the implementation and completion of 

plans/programs and activities, to ensure effective delivery of services 
and to address the needs of the students and other stakeholders, as 
required under Section 24 of the CMO; and 

 
d. prepare and submit Utilization Report with specific budget 

allocations per thrust/program/activities in conformity with line item 
requirements specified in the CMO No. 20 series of 2011.  

 
3.14 Management commented that they will revisit its STF Planning practices and 

shall determine its true absorptive capacity in the finalization of the Program 
of Receipts and Expenditures (PRE) for CY 2021. 
 

Implementation of Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) Program  
 

4. From the funds released for TES program for Academic Year (AY) 2019-2020 
amounting to P885,800.00, only P140,000.00 or 15.80 percent was utilized due 
to delay in the release of funds by CHED which prevented the student-
grantees from the timely utilization thereof, thus defeating the purpose of the 
TES program. Moreover, a separate Bank Account/SL was not maintained 
for the amount received for the TES program, contrary to Section XII, Item 7 
of the JMC No. 004 s. 2020. 

 
4.1 The TES was established under RA No. 10931, also known as the Universal 

Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act of 2017 (UniFAST), to support the 
cost of tertiary education or any part or portion thereof of poor but deserving 
Filipino students who are enrolled in the 112 state universities and colleges 
(SUCs) and 78 local universities and colleges (LUCs) in the Philippines and 
whose names appear in the Listahanan 2.0 or the Pantawid Pamilyang 
Pilipino Program (4Ps) list of the Department of Social Welfare and 
Development (DSWD).  

 
4.2 The TES targets not necessarily those who are poor, but those who have no 

access to public university system. This grants-in-aid program is intended to 
support the costs of college education, particularly use for books and other 
education-related expenses such as transportation, supplies, room, lodging 
and board fees. 

 
4.3 Based on the SL from CHED-UNIFAST, a total of ₱885,800.00 intended for 

the implementation of the TES program was released to MPC for AY 2019-
2020. The said budget included the payment of TES allowances to qualified 
student beneficiaries providing them with a monthly stipend of ₱3,500.00 



75 
 

and a book allowance of ₱2,500.00 every semester, or a total of ₱20,000.00 
per semester or ₱40,000.00 annually and three percent (3%) administrative 
costs. Details are as follows:

4.4 Audit of payrolls, schedules and Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) revealed that 
the TES Grants from CHED-UniFAST for AY 2019-2020 were utilized as 
follows:

Percent 83.72% 100.00% 84.20% 
 

4.5 As can be gleaned from the table above, the College had paid the student 
beneficiaries their TES allowances amounting to ₱140,000.00, leaving an 
unexpended balance of 84.20% or ₱745,800.00. Records show that: 

 
a. On March 03, 2020, MPC received ₱144,000.00 from CHED, which was 

intended for the payment of TES grants to the beneficiaries for the 1st 
Semester of the AY 2019-2020. Per General Payroll No. 2020-04-057, 
₱140,000.00 was distributed to the seven student beneficiaries.  

 
b. The Audit Team had sent a letter to verify the status of the remaining 

subsidy and administrative costs reflected in the SL from CHED totaling 
₱782,800.00, which were intended for the TES beneficiaries for the 1st 
and 2nd semesters of AY 2019-2020 and found out that the said funds are 
yet to be received and distributed as follows:

c. Moreover, the stipend as well as the corresponding administrative cost 

intended to benefit student under the 4th Prioritization Category-
NonListahanan 2.0 (4Ps Beneficiaries) for AY 2018-2019 amounting to  
P41,200.00 was not yet received by the College nor distributed to the 
students.  

 
d. According to the College’s Director of the Office of the Student Affairs, 

they were not informed that there were already available funds for MPC 
representing the subsidy of the student-beneficiaries, hence no payment 
for the first and second semesters had been granted to the beneficiaries, 
and thus the objective of the program was defeated. 

 
4.6 Further, per confirmation made by the Audit Team, it was noted that 

liquidations  submitted by MPC to CHED on December 23, 2019 amounting 
to P803,400.00 and P267,800.00 for TES and ESGP-PA, respectively, 
covering AY 2018-2019 were not reflected in the CHED’s SL as of February 
11, 2021, as follows:

4.7 Section 114 of PD No. 1445 states that:  

 
i. The government accounting system shall be on a double entry basis 

with a general ledger in which all financial transactions are recorded; 
and 

ii. Subsidiary records shall be kept where necessary. 
 



77 
 

4.8 Rule 6.2 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the UniFAST states 
that:  

 
A separate book of accounts shall be kept by each implementing agency 
for the  UniFAST StuFAP funds. The book of accounts shall follow 
standard government rules and regulation for accounting. xxxx 

 
4.9 Moreover, for proper implementation of the billing and disbursement 

procedures and monitoring of the TES payments to public and private HEIs,  
Joint Memorandum Circular (JMC) No. 04 s.2020 was issued to further set 
out enhanced guidelines on the TES program. Section XII of the said JMC 
specifically mentioned that Higher Education Institutions should: 

 
(7.6.1) xxxx; 
(7.6.2) Maintain a separate bank account with the Land Bank of the 

Philippines, for proper management of TES; 
(7.6.3) Provide bank account details for cheque received from the 

CHED Regional Office, to the proper account maintained; 
(7.6.4) xxxx; 
(7.6.5) xxxx; 

 
4.10 During the course of audit, we have noted that the MPC did not maintain a 

separate bank account for the amount received for the TES program. Instead, 
the funds received from the CHED-UNIFAST are being deposited in the 
College’s STF bank account, contrary to Section XII, Item 7 of the JMC 
No.004 s.2020. 

 
4.11 We recommended that  Management: 

 
a. maintain a separate bank account and SL for the TES fund for 

proper account management; 
 

b. submit Liquidation Report and return any unused fund to CHED-
UniFAST; and 

 
c. closely monitor and strengthen coordination with CHED, thru its 

representative, and the College UniFAST Focal person, on the 
release of grants and its related documents, to facilitate the timely 
release of funds to student beneficiaries. 

 
4.12 Management commented that they will open a separate bank account in 

accordance with the guidelines. The Scholarship Coordinator will also 
strengthen coordination with CHED to facilitate the timely release of the 
TES funds to beneficiaries.

Rights to its Land and Building being occupied 
 
5. The MPC had not asserted their rights as owner of Land and Buildings which 

are being occupied by both public offices and private businesses, contrary to 
Chapter 1, Title II of the Civil Code of the Philippines, thus depriving the 
College of the benefits that it could have enjoyed from the use and lease of the 
properties. 

 
5.1 Chapter 1, Title II of the Civil Code of the Philippines provides the 

following articles in the Ownership in General, among others, to wit: 
 

Art. 428 The owner has the right to enjoy and dispose of a thing, 
without other limitations than those established by law. 

 
The owner has also a right of action against the holder and 
possessor of the thing in order to recover it. (348a) 

 
Art. 429  The owner or lawful possessor of a thing has the right to 

exclude any person from the enjoyment and disposal thereof. 
For this purpose, he may use such force as may be reasonably 
necessary to repel or prevent an actual or threatened unlawful 
physical invasion or usurpation of his property. (n) 

 
Art. 433 Actual possession under claim of ownership raises disputable 

presumption of ownership. The true owner must resort to 
judicial process for the recovery of the property. (n) 

 
Art. 434. In an action to recover, the property must be identified, and the 

plaintiff must rely on the strength of his title and not on the 
weakness of the defendant's claim. (n) 

 
5.2 Section 122, PD No. 1445 also provides that unjustified failure on the part of 

the official or employee concerned to submit the documents and reports 
mentioned herein shall be considered a ground for the automatic suspension 
of payment of salary until he shall have complied with the aforesaid 
requirements, without prejudice to any disciplinary action that may be 
instituted against him. 

 
5.3 Records of the MPC showed that as of December 31, 2020, the Land account 

has an outstanding balance of P35,044,800.00. This included a parcel of land 
with a total perimeter of more or less 58,408 square meters per Transfer 
Certificate of Title (TCT) Number (27764) 009-2017009920 and on an 
account of a Deed of Sale between the Marikina Institute of Science and 
Technology (MIST), which is the MPC now, and the National Housing 
Authority. 

 



79 
 

5.4 On February 6, 2017, Mr. Alex O. Cervera Ed. D, Head, Building and Estate 
of MPC conducted a measurement of the college perimeter and it was found 
out that the estimated area of the College is about 46,500 square meters only, 
thus a missing area of more or less 11,908 square meters from the total land 
area of 58,408 square meters. 

 
5.5 A relocation survey, conducted in 2018 by the MPC revealed that the 

missing land area was being occupied by both public and private entities, the 
identified occupants  therein are as follows:  

 
a. Portions of Marikina City Hall; 
b. The Office of Atty. Cesar Ching; and 
c. Various commercial establishments along Shoe Avenue 

 
The said portion of land was found to be located just outside the College 
perimeter. 

 
5.6 During the ocular inspection conducted by the Audit Team, it was validated 

that the land was occupied by different entities, mostly stores and upon 
random interview with the salespersons present in the area, it was revealed 
that they are renting the place on a monthly basis from a private entity, and 
that they are not aware that the MPC owns the property. 

 
5.7 Also, review of records of MPC Buildings showed that six of the MPC 

buildings located inside the College perimeter are being utilized by 
Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) and 
Marikina Science High School. Details are as follows:

5.8 There were no available data for Ylagan Hall and Dormitory to date.  The 
Property Officer said that when he assumed office in 2013, no data were 
turned over to him. The use by these two entities of the Land and Buildings 
of MPC was not covered by any usufruct nor lease agreement and no rental 
income was derived from these properties. 

 
5.9 Despite the continuous claims of the MPC that they are the rightful owner of 

the abovementioned Land and Buildings, the MPC had neither asserted their 
rights as provided in the articles above nor enforced legal action against the 
individuals who are benefiting from the rent of the property.  These 
properties could have been used by the MPC for their programs or as part of 
their Income Generating Project (IGP), thus deprived the College of the 
benefits and income which they could have gained from the use and lease of 
property.  

 
5.10 The MPC alleged that they are currently in the process of pursuing legal 

claims against the above government and private entities to assert their 
ownership over the properties by hiring a lawyer, but proof of the actions 
taken and communications made to recover the property being used by 
private individual/entities and other legal documentations/papers were not 
furnished to COA for verification.  

 
5.11 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. pursue legal claims to assert their rights against the occupants and 
lessors of the mentioned property in order to recover it or enjoy its 
benefits in accordance with Chapter 1, Title II of the Civil Code of 
the Philippines;  

 



81 
 

b. enter into usufruct/lease or agreement with the TESDA and 
Marikina Science High School to set out guidelines on the use of 
MPC premises and properties; and 

 
c. inform/furnish the Audit Team with any actions taken and 

communications made by the College to recover the property used 
by private individual/entities and other legal documentations/papers 
for verification within ten days from receipt hereof pursuant to 
Section 122 of PD No. 1445. 

 
5.12 Management commented that they will continue talks with TESDA and will 

move to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with them. They will also 
investigate further the private entities occupying MPC property. 

 
Delayed Submission of Financial Statements, Reports and Supporting Documents 
 
6. Substantial delay ranging from ten to 238 days had been incurred in the 

submission of the  required monthly and quarterly financial/accounting 
reports and accounts together with the Official Receipts (ORs)/DVs/Payrolls 
and their supporting documents, contrary to COA Circulars and pertinent 
provisions of the GAM  for NGAs, Volume I, which precluded the Audit 
Team from conducting timely audit of the transactions and analysis/review of 
the Agency’s financial records, thus MPC  could not also institute 
immediately the necessary adjustments/corrections and other remedial 
measures to avoid possible audit suspensions/disallowances in post-audit. 

 
6.1 The Head of the Agency, who is primarily responsible for all government 

funds and property pertaining to his Office, shall ensure that the required 
financial reports and statements are submitted by the concerned Agency 
officials in such form and within the period prescribed by the Commission 
on Audit. 
 

6.2 Issuances, pertinent laws and related COA rules and regulations set timelines 
on the preparation and submission of accounts, financial reports, statements, 
trial balances and supporting schedules, records and other required reports to 
the Office of the Auditor, as summarized below:

6.3 Also, Section 122 of PD No. 1445, on the Submission of Reports,  provides 

that: 
 



83 
 

(1) Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the 
Commission may under regulations issued by it require the 
agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, 
disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, and 
other responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial 
balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of 
personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the 
exercise of its functions. 

 
(2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the 

documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically 
cause the suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall 
have complied with the requirements of the Commission.  

 
(3) No appropriation authorized in the General Appropriations Act 

shall be available to pay the salary of any official or employee 
who violates the provisions of this section, without prejudice to 
any disciplinary action that may be instituted against such 
official or employee. 

       
6.4 During the Entrance Conference  (EC) conducted on October 28, 2020, the 

Audit Team had discussed with the Management the deadline for submission 
of reports for CY 2020, which was reiterated in the Audit Team’s letter dated 
November 04, 2020. 
 

6.5 The attached Annex A shows the frequency of submission by the Accountant 
of the DVs, Payrolls, ORs, JEVs, financial reports, Monthly TBs, Quarterly 
FSs and Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs) for CY 
2020. 

 
6.6 It can be gleaned from the said Annex that except for the RAAF, the Agency 

incurred substantial delay in the submission of accounts/DVs, Monthly TBs 
and Quarterly FSs, ranging from ten to 238 days, contrary to various COA 
Circulars and provisions of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. We understand 
that the College’s workforce is limited as employees are still in alternative 
work arrangements, however, we would like to reiterate the importance of 
submitting timely and complete required monthly and quarterly 
financial/accounting reports for audit purposes.  

 
6.7 The delayed submission of the said accounts, financial/accounting reports 

and statements and other records/documents prevented the Audit Team from 
conducting a timely audit and verification of financial transactions and 
analysis/review of the Agency’s financial records, thereby Management was 
not afforded relevant and timely financial information which could have 
served as an aid in their decisions and inputs in enhancing financial 
accountability. 



84 
 

6.8 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. submit the reports within set deadlines and adhere strictly to the 
provisions of the abovementioned provisions; 

 
b. fast-track the preparation and submission of reports, which are long 

overdue; and 
 

c. subject the officials and employees concerned to automatic 
suspension of their salaries and/or administrative disciplinary action 
for any unjustified failure to comply with the requirements on the 
submission of financial transactions, statements and reports as 
provided in Section 122 of PD No. 1445. 

 
6.9 Management commented that additional Job Order (JO) personnel were 

already hired in the Accounting Office to minimize, if not to eliminate, the 
delays in the submission of reports. 

 
Absence of Internal Audit Service 
 
7. MPC has no Internal Audit Service (IAS) as mandated under RA No. 3456, 

Administrative Order (AO) No. 278 s.1992, AO No. 70 s. 2003 and related 
issuances, which shall assist Management to achieve an efficient and effective 
fiscal administration and performance of agency affairs and functions. 
 
7.1 Section 2 of the RA No. 3456, known as the Internal Auditing Act of 1962, 

states that:  
 

There shall be created, organized and operated in all departments, 
bureaus and offices of the National Government, internal audit 
services which shall assist management to achieve an efficient and 
effective fiscal administration and performance of agency affairs and 
functions.  

 
7.2 Section 1 of AO No. 278, s.1992, and AO No. 70 s. 2003 dated April 28, 

1992 and April 14, 2003, respectively, require all heads of Government-
Owned and/or Controlled Corporations (GOCCs), including Government 
Financial Institutions (GFIs), State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) and 
Local Government Units (LGUs), to organize an IAS in their respective 
offices. 
 

7.3 Section 1.1 of AO No. 278, s.1992 states that: “The Internal Audit Service 
(IAS) shall be an integral part of the office/organization and shall assist the 
institution management in the effective discharge of its responsibilities 
insofar as the same would not encroach on or be adversarial with those of the 
auditors of the Commission on Audit. It shall function in accordance with the 



85 
 

policies established by the provisions of RA No. 3456, as amended by RA 
No. 4177, and shall perform staff functions with primary responsibilities 
encompassing the examination and evaluation of the adequacy and 
effectiveness of internal control and the quality of performance.”  

 
7.4 In addition to the above duties, the same AO stated that IAS shall not be 

responsible for or required to participate in procedures which are essentially 
a part of regular operating activities or in operations, which are the primary 
responsibility of another unit in the organization. The IAS shall be detached 
from all functions of routine operating character, such as the following: 

 
• Pre-audit of vouchers and counter-signature of checks; 
• Inspection of deliveries, although the internal auditor may, as part of 

his examination, observe inspection; 
• Preparation of treasury and bank reconciliation statements; 
• Development and installation of systems and procedures; however, in 

exceptional cases, the internal auditor may assist by way of giving 
suggestions; 

• Taking physical inventories; however, the internal auditor may 
review the plans in advance and observe and test-check the accuracy 
of counting, costing and summarizing; 

• Maintaining property records; and 
• All other activities related to operations. 

 
7.5 It further requires that Agencies without an internal audit service/unit shall 

constitute one to be staffed by assigning or deploying personnel from other 
units of the Agency. 

 
7.6 Moreover, AO No. 70 s. 2003 mandates that the IAS shall assist the 

Management in the effective discharge of its responsibilities, without 
intruding into the authority and mandate of the Commission on Audit (COA) 
granted under the Constitution. 

 
7.7 Contrary to abovementioned laws and Presidential issuances, the MPC has 

no IAS which shall assist Management to achieve an efficient and effective 
fiscal administration and performance of agency affairs and functions. 

 
7.8 Internal Audit is a cornerstone of good governance in organization and can 

play an important role to improve management and accountability, both 
financial and non–financial. This enables the College to anticipate potential 
future concerns as well as identify current weaknesses. It also enables the 
Institute to identify processes and controls that are not working effectively 
and allows an opportunity to improve on these. 

 
7.9 We recommended that Management comply with the rules and 

regulations on the creation/organization and implementation of an 



86 
 

IAS/Internal Audit Unit (IAU) pursuant to RA No. 3456, AO No. 278, s. 
1992; AO No. 70 s. 2003 and related issuances. 

 
7.10 Management commented that they already issued a Memorandum for the 

creation of the IAS, however, due to the absence of plantilla items, they still 
have to identify qualified personnel to serve in the IAS. Nevertheless, 
Management aims to establish the IAS before the end of the year. 

 
Transparency Seal 
 
8. The non-compliance by the Management with the requirements of various 

sections of the General Provisions in the General Appropriations Act (GAA) 
and the National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 542 dated August 29, 2012, on 
transparency and public disclosure of government transactions, is depriving 
the public of pertinent information necessary to enforce accountability among 
the Officials of the Agency. 

 
8.1 Section 94 of the General  Provisions of the GAA  for FY 2020  states that: 

 
To enhance transparency and enforce accountability, all agencies of the 
government shall maintain a Transparency Seal to be posted on their 
websites. Xxxx 

 
 The head of the agencies and their web administrator or their equivalent 
shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with this section.  

 
8.2 This compliance with the provisions on Transparency Seal as provided in the 

General Provisions of the GAA FY 2020 was reiterated under the NBC No. 
542 dated August 29, 2012. Moreover, it states that a Transparency Seal, 
which is prominently displayed on the main page of the website of a 
particular government agency, is a certificate that it has complied with the 
Transparency Seal Requirement of the GAA.  
 

8.3 Prior year’s exploration done by the Audit Team of the College’s website 
(https://mpc.edu.ph) showed that the following requirements of the various 
sections of the General Provisions of the GAA are either not complied with 
or not updated by the College.

8.4 The above deficiencies were also noted in our prior year’s audit 

observations. Verification of any updates in the above non-compliance 
cannot be done by the Team as the College’s official website is currently 
inaccessible as renewal of the website subscription is still in process. 

 
8.5 The College’s non-compliance with and/or its non-update of the 

Transparency Seal denied the public of vital information that will enable 
them to productively participate in transactions which may involve or benefit 
them.  

 
8.6 Section 5.4 of the NBC No. 542 points out that the deficiency or delinquency 

in the maintenance of the Transparency Seal may be considered as 
tantamount to violation of Section 57 of the Chapter 6 (Budget 
Accountability) of Book VI of the Administrative Code of 1987. 

 
8.7 We reiterate that the Head of the College strictly ensure full compliance 

with the requirements on transparency and public disclosure of 



88 
 

government transactions as provided in the General Provisions of the 
GAA, FY 2020 and NBC  No. 542 dated August 29, 2012. 

 
8.8 Management commented that they will comply with transparency seal 

disclosures requirement in one week. 
 
Non-Submission of Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation (AAPSI) 
 
9. Management did not provide the Audit Team with the required Agency 

Action Plan and Status of Implementation (AAPSI) on the audit observations 
and recommendations of 2019 and prior years despite repeated requests, 
contrary to Section 89 of the General Provisions of the General 
Appropriations Act (GAA) of 2020 or RA No. 11465. 
 
9.1 The head of agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds 

and property pertaining to his office, shall ensure that the required reports are 
submitted by the concerned agency official in such form and within the 
period prescribed by the Commission on Audit. 

 
9.2 Section 89 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act of 

2020 (RA No. 11465) provides that:      
 

Within sixty (60) days from receipt of the COA Annual Audit Report, 
agencies concerned shall submit to the COA, either in printed form or by 
way of electronic document, a status report on the actions taken on said 
audit findings and recommendations using the prescribed form under 
COA Memorandum No. 2014-002 dated March 18, 2014. They shall 
likewise furnish the DBM, the House Committee on Appropriations and 
the Senate Committee on Finance, either in printed form or by way of 
electronic document, a copy of said reports. 

 
The head of agency concerned and the agency’s web administrator or 
his/her equivalent shall be responsible for ensuring that said status reports 
are posted on the agency’s website. 

 
9.3 The Agency Action Plan (AAP) is prescribed in the Integrated Results and 

Risk-Based Audit Manual (IRRBAM). It is a tool for government agencies 
to indicate action plans on the audit observations and recommendations 
contained in the Annual Audit Report (AAR), and for the auditor to monitor 
the said action plans. Likewise, under the General Provisions of the annual 
GAA, the audited agencies are required to submit within 60 days upon 
receipt of the COA AAR a status report on the actions taken on the audit 
observations and recommendations. 

 
9.4 Management emailed an advance copy of AAPSI of CY 2019 Audit before 

the issuance of AAR for CY 2019, however, such report contains only 



89 
 

actions to be taken by the Management. The AAP which includes Action 
Plan, Person/Department Responsible and Target Implementation Date and 
Status of Implementation were not filled out, thus makes it difficult for the 
Audit Team to monitor and validate the status of the implementation of audit 
recommendations. 

 
9.5 The signed copy of the above AAPSI was not submitted to the Audit Team 

despite commitment to submit the hard copy once signed and the said status 
reports were not posted on the Agency’s website as required under Section 
89 of GAA for CY 2020. 

 
9.6 In previous year’s observation, the Audit Team recommended to the 

Management to submit an updated and completely filled-out AAPSI to be 
submitted within 60 days upon receipt of the COA AAR, containing a status 
report on the actions taken on the audit observations and recommendations, 
however no reports were submitted as to date.  Constant follow-ups through 
phone calls, verbal communication and follow-up letters were also made 
regarding the said report, but no compliance therewith was received from the 
Management.  AAPSI of prior years’ audit were not submitted as well 
despite repeated demands. 

 
9.7 We acknowledged Management efforts to prepare the said report, however, 

we would like to inform Management about the prescribed period set for its 
submission since the Audit Team still has to verify, monitor and validate the 
information contained in the AAPSI, in compliance with COA Memorandum 
No. 2014-002 dated March 18, 2014. This non-submission of updated 
AAPSI hinders the Audit Team in the timely validation of the actions taken 
by Management on the audit recommendations. 

 
9.8 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. ensure that the required AAPSI on the audit observations and 
recommendations of 2019 and prior years be submitted to COA on 
time, copy furnished the DBM, the House Committee on 
Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Finance, either in 
printed form or by way of electronic document and post it on the 
Agency’s website as required under Section 89 of the General 
Provisions of the GAA of 2020 or  RA No. 11465.  
 

b. use the prescribed form provided under COA Memorandum No. 
2014-002 dated March 18, 2014 in the preparation of the AAPSI and 
make sure that all fields are properly filled-out. 

 
9.9 Management commented that the AAPSI was already submitted as of May 

13, 2021. 
 



90 
 

Compliance with the Property Insurance Law 
 
10. Non-compliance with the pertinent provisions of RA No. 656, or the Property 

Insurance Law, resulted in over and under insurance of insurable properties, 
thus there was a waste of government funds and exposure of properties to the 
risk of not being amply indemnified for any damage suffered or loss due to 
fire, earthquake, storm or other unforeseen events. Moreover, the MPC did 
not submit Property Inventory Form (PIF) as required under COA Circular 
No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018. 

 
10.1 RA No. 656, or the Property Insurance Law was enacted to establish a 

“Property Insurance Fund,” the administration of which was placed under 
the GSIS. It was amended by PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973, which 
requires all government agencies to have their insurable properties, assets, 
and interests insured with the GIF administered by the GSIS to ensure 
compensation of the equivalent value thereof in case of loss thru fire, theft 
or any unforeseen events. 

 
10.2 The Office of the President and COA have been persistent in reminding all 

National Government Agencies to enforce compliance with RA No. 656, 
thus the following issuances have been issued: 

 
a) Memorandum Circular No. 634 dated May 10, 1973 – requiring all 

departments, bureaus, offices, agencies and instrumentalities of 
government, all provincial, city and municipal governments and 
government-owned and controlled corporations to insure their 
properties and assets in accordance with Property Insurance Law; 

 
b) COA Circular Nos. 79-112 dated August 30, 1979 and 92-390 dated 

November 17, 1992 – to assist the GSIS in implementing the Property 
Insurance Law; 

 
c) Administrative Order No. 33 series of 1987 – prescribing guidelines 

for insurance of all properties, contracts, rights of action and other 
insurance risks of the government, including those in which the 
government has an insurable interest, with the General Insurance Fund 
(GIF) of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS); and 

 
d) COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 – prescribing the 

submission of the Property Inventory Form as basis for the assessment 
of general insurance coverage over all insurable assets, properties and 
interests of the government with the  GIF of the GSIS. The Circular was 
issued to assist in the implementation of the provisions of RA No. 656 
on the insurance and bonding of risk on insurable government assets 
and properties with the GIF.

10.3 The PPE account, which forms part of the insurable assets of the MPC, has 
a balance of P152,927,048.38 as of January 1, 2020. Details are as follows:

10.4 Evaluation of MPC’s compliance with the Property Insurance Law revealed 

that on February 15, 2020, the MPC paid P643,855.44 insurance premiums 
to the GSIS under Check No. 495810 dated February 28, 2020 for the 
insurance of its PPE amounting to P134,051,363.01, for which GSIS issued 
OR No. 7550043161 dated February 28, 2020. Summary of Inventory of 
PPE Insured is shown below:

10.5 Comparison between the recorded Insurable Assets and Schedule of Insured 
PPE showed an over and under insurance of properties, resulting in wastage 
of government funds for over insurance and exposure of properties to the 
risk of not being indemnified for any damage suffered or loss due to fire, 
earthquake, storm or other unforeseen events in case of under insurance. A 
Schedule of Discrepancies is shown below:

10.6 In the absence of an insurance coverage, the properties of the government 
are not amply protected from the risk of non-indemnification in case these 
will suffer any damage or loss due to fire, earthquake, storm or other 
fortuitous events. By securing property insurance, the Agency mitigates the 
risks of non-indemnification in case of loss and ensures the protection of 
government resources. 

 
10.7 Moreover, the MPC did not prepare and submit the Property Inventory 

Form (PIF) to the Office of the Auditor, contrary to COA Circular No. 
2018-002 dated May 31, 2018, which requires pertinent officials to prepare 
the PIF listing all the insurable properties and other assets, showing their 
latest appraised values/valuation, appraisal date, location and other 
information as annexed thereto, and submit the same to the Supervising 
Auditor or Audit Team Leader, and the GIF, GSIS, not later than April 30 
of each year. 

 
10.8 Section 5.5 of the same Circular also provides that: 
 

Failure on the part of the agency officials concerned and the GSIS to 
submit and receive, respectively, the documents and reports mentioned 
therein, as well as the failure of the GSIS underwriting officials to 
assess the premium due within the timeframe herein prescribed, shall 
subsequently cause the suspension of the payment of their salaries until 
they shall have complied with the requirements of RA No. 656 and its 
Implementing Rules and Regulations, as well as the provisions of this 
Circular. 

 



93 
 

10.9 Non-preparation of the required PIF deprives MPC to have an adequate 
basis in determining the correct amount of insurance coverage and the 
amount to be paid to GIF, and non-submission thereof hinders the Audit 
Team in determining the accuracy of the amount paid as Insurance 
Expenses. 

 
10.10 We recommended that Management: 

 
a. immediately secure property insurance of its uninsured assets in 

compliance with the rules and regulations of RA No. 656, as 
amended by PD No. 245, and record payment of insurance 
premiums as prescribed; 

 
b. prepare and submit the required PIF containing accurate valuation 

of the properties reported therein, and make it the basis for 
insurance coverage to prevent over and under insurance of the 
insurable assets; and  

 
c. impose appropriate sanction against the concerned responsible 

officer in case of unjustifiable non-compliance with the submission 
of PIF. 

 
10.11 Management commented that they will coordinate with the GSIS for the 

offsetting of over insured properties with under insured properties 
 
Gender and Development (GAD), 
 
11. MPC allotted 5.93 percent or P8,218,000.00 of the College’s total budget 

appropriations authorized under the GAA of P138,608,000.00 to support 
GAD plans and programs in compliance with Item 6.1 of PCW-NEDA-DBM 
Joint Circular No. 2012-01. However, most of the College GAD projected 
activities were not fully completed as 80.95 percent remained in progress and 
not accomplished. Also, only 2.11 percent or P173,800.00 of its total approved 
agency budget was utilized, leaving P8,044,200.00 unutilized allotment, thus 
not fully compliant with the provisions of the foregoing Joint Circular 
resulting in the inability to completely address  GAD related concerns. 

 
11.1 EO No. 273 (Approving and Adopting the Philippine Plan for Gender-

Responsive Development (PPGD 1995-2025) mandates that the agencies 
incorporate and reflect GAD concerns in their agency performance 
commitment contracts, annual budget proposals, and work and financial 
plan 

 
11.2 Item 6.1 of Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides that at least five percent of 

the total agency budget appropriations authorized under the annual GAA 
shall correspond to activities supporting GAD plans and programs. The 



94 
 

GAD budget shall be drawn from the agency’s MOOE, CO and PS. It is 
understood that the GAD budget does not constitute an additional budget 
over an agency’s total budget appropriations. 

 
11.3 In addition, Items 11.1 and 11.2 of Joint Circular No. 2012-01 state that:  

 
“Pursuant to Section 36 of the MCW, The Commission on Audit (COA) 
shall conduct an annual audit on the use of the GAD budget for the purpose 
of determining its judicious use and the efficiency and effectiveness of 
interventions in addressing gender issues towards the realization of the 
objectives of the country’s commitments, plans, and policies on women’s 
empowerment, gender equality and GAD. Provided further in Section 37 of 
the MCW-IRR, the COA shall conduct an annual audit of GAD funds of all 
government agencies, offices, bureaus, SUCs, GOCCs, all government 
instrumentalities and all others concerned.” 

 
11.4 Pursuant to the provisions of FY 2020 GAA, the GAD Plan shall be 

integrated in the regular activities of the agencies which shall be at least 
five percent of the total appropriations allotted to them. For CY 2020, MPC 
has a total appropriation of P138,608,000.00, of which P8,218,000.00 or 
5.93 percent of it was allotted for GAD Plans and Targets.  

  
11.5 For CY 2020, the College submitted the annual GAD Accomplishment 

Report in accordance with the format prescribed under Annex B of Joint 
Circular No. 2012-01, which includes columns for: a) GAD Activities 
Submitted to the PCW and CHED;  b) MPC Activity; c) Approved GAD 
Budget; and d) Actual Cost/Expenditure per project/program/activity. 

 
11.6 We reviewed the MPC’s GAD Plan and Accomplishment for CY 2020 and 

observed that the activities set to be accomplished in 2020 were not fully 
completed, as follows:

11.8 With reference to the foregoing table, CY 2020 targeted activities in MPC’s 

GAD plan were not fully completed as 80.95% remain in-progress and not 
accomplished. Management disclosed that the reasons for the above rate 
were due to legal restrictions imposed by the government brought about by 
the Pandemic.   

 
11.9 From the above tables, we further observed the following: 
 

• only 2.11 percent or P173,800.00 of its total approved agency budget of 
P8,218,000.00 was utilized, leaving a balance of P8,044,200.00 
unutilized allotment; 

 



98 
 

• the last three activities were not included in the PCW-approved GAD 
Plan and Budgets (GPBs). The College shall inform PCW if there are 
changes in the PCW-endorsed GPBs as a result of revising the GPB 
based on approved GAA and/or the need to implement additional PAPs 
relevant to current gender issues or GAD-related undertakings as needed; 

 
• six activities scheduled in CY 2020 GAD Plan are still in-progress status 

and expenses incurred on these six ongoing construction projects were 
not yet accounted. These activities should have been finished by the end 
of CY 2020 as planned. Percentage of expenses and accomplishment for 
the ongoing six construction projects should have been reported or 
quantified at the end of the calendar year to see the actual utilization of 
the approved agency budget for GAD; and 

 
• activity number 21 is intended for the Elderly Citizens and Persons with 

Disability, yet this was included in the GAD Accomplishment Report. 
The Agency should have a separate set of projected activities for PWD 
and the elderly. 

 
11.10 We understand the reason for non-implementation of the targeted activities 

which are beyond the control of the Management. While we recognize that 
GAD plans are flexible due to the Pandemic, the average achievement rate 
of 19.05 percent and 2.11 percent utilization rate are not satisfactory. 
College-targeted GAD Plan activities in CY 2020 were not substantially 
accomplished and completed, which adversely affected the attainment of 
College goals and objectives on GAD related concerns. 

 
11.11 Management may consider improving goal settings that starts with 

prioritization of activities and careful consideration of what the College 
wants to achieve. Prioritization provides a way to sort a diverse set of items 
into an order of importance. It also identifies their relative importance by 
deriving a numerical value for the priority of each item. It will provide a 
means for ranking projects based on criteria that are determined to be 
important. This enables the College to see clearly which projects are the 
most important to focus on first, and which, if any, could be put on hold or 
discontinued. 

 
11.12 With the information above, GAD planned activities for CY 2020 were not 

fully completed, thus the objectives were not fully attained. 
 

11.13 We recommended that Management, thru the GAD Focal Committee: 
 

a. enhance its GAD planning, budgeting, target setting and 
implementation by setting a reasonable and realistic GPBs and time 
frame to complete the activities and prevent postponement of 
planned activities;  



99 
 

b. implement a robust monitoring on the completion and 
implementation of the GAD Plan activities and Budgets to ensure 
higher utilization rate and full accomplishment of the projects to 
attain College GAD related objectives; and  

 
c. strictly comply with the requirements of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint 

Circular No. 2012-01 by considering only GAD related 
undertakings and approved GPBs, otherwise, the College shall 
inform PCW if there are changes in the PCW-endorsed GPBs. 

 
11.14 Management commented that they moved to improve their GAD Planning 

and exert all efforts to implement them. 
 
Senior Citizens and Differently-Abled Persons 
 
12. MPC did not prepare/submit a comprehensive plan intended to address the 

concerns of Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs), as 
required under Section 32 of the General Provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 
11465 for CY 2020. 

 
12.1 Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA No.11465 requires all agencies 

of the government to formulate plans, programs and projects intended to 
address the concerns of SCs and PWDs, insofar as it relates to their 
mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities. 

 
12.2 Moreover, all government facilities, including infrastructure, non-

infrastructure and civil works project of the government, as well as office 
buildings, streets and highways shall provide architectural features, designs 
or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of 
persons with disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA No. 
7277.   

 
12.3 We noted that the CY 2020 Physical and Financial Plans did not contain a 

comprehensive plan that would lead to the achievement of Programs and 
Projects related to SC and PWDs. 

 
12.4 Per review of the GAD Accomplishment Report submitted, MPC included 

one activity for the SCs and differently-abled persons. Its objective is to 
make them feel that they are special and important members of the school 
community. However, the activity was not done due to the COVID-19 
Pandemic where SC and PWDs were required to stay at home. 

 
12.5 We also observed that based on the submitted FY 2020 Physical and 

Financial Plans, no data refer to 2020 Financial Performance/Target. 
 

12.6 The Physical and Financial Plan needs to be enhanced. A plan should 
contain a list of steps that must be taken in order to achieve a specific goal. 



100 
 

It is supposed to clarify what resources are required to reach the goal, 
formulate a timeline for when specific tasks need to be completed, 
determine what resources are required, a list of activities with concrete 
targets, and a set of indicators to be monitored. As a consequence, tracking 
of the progress of its implementation can be challenging. 

 
12.7 Inasmuch as MPC livelihood program benefited Senior Citizens and PWDs, 

MPC must have separate programs or projects intended to address the 
concerns of SCs and PWDs, as this is required under Section 32 of the 
General Provisions of RA No. 11465. 

 
12.8 We recommended that Management prepare a comprehensive plan for 

Senior Citizens and PWDs with concrete targets, timelines and 
benchmarks and facilitate monitoring of the progress of its 
implementation. 

 
12.9 Management commented that through the HRDO, they will include a 

comprehensive plan for Senior Citizens and PWDs in its planning and exert 
all efforts to implement them. 

 
Remittances to GSIS, BIR, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG Fund 
 
13. For CY 2020, the Agency has faithfully deducted from the salaries of its 

personnel the required taxes and premiums and remitted the same as well as 
the government share within the prescribed period to the concerned 
institutions or agencies as provided under pertinent rules and regulations. 

 
13.1 Section 7 of the BIR Revenue Regulations No. 1-2013 dated January 23, 

2013 states that the due date for filing of tax returns withheld from suppliers 
should be on or before the 10th day following the month in which 
withholding was made, except for taxes withheld for the month of 
December of each year, which shall be filed on or before January 15 of the 
succeeding year. 

 
13.2 Section 14.1, Rule III of RA No. 8291, the GSIS Act of 1997, requires that 

each government agency shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ 
and government agency’s contributions within the first ten days of the 
calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply. The 
remittance by the government agency of the contributions to the GSIS shall 
take priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except 
salaries and wages of its employees. 

 
13.3 Section 3 (b and c), Rule VII of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of 

RA No. 9679, the Home Development Mutual Fund Law of 2009 states 
that: 

 



101 
 

b. Every employer required to set aside and remit such contributions 
as prescribed under RA No. 9679 and these Rules shall be liable 
for their payment, and non-payment thereof shall further subject 
the employer to a penalty of three percent (3%) per month of the 
amounts payable from the date the contributions fall due until 
paid. Every employer who actually deducts from the salary of his 
employee the latter’s loan amortization or payments to the Fund, 
as provided for under these Rules, shall be liable for their 
payment, and non-payment thereof shall likewise further subject 
the employer to a penalty of three percent (3%) per month of the 
amounts payable from the date the loan amortizations or payments 
fall due until paid. 

 
c. It shall be mandatory and compulsory for all government 

instrumentalities, agencies, including government-owned and 
controlled corporations, to provide the payment of contributions 
in their annual appropriations. Penal sanctions shall be imposed 
upon these employers who fail to include the payment of 
contributions on time, or delay the remittance of the required 
contributions to the Fund. The heads of offices and agencies shall 
be administratively liable for non-remittance of the required 
contributions to the Fund.  

 
13.4 As of December 31, 2020, the amounts withheld and remitted by MPC were

Status of Settlements of Audit Suspensions and Disallowances/Charges 

 
14. Total disallowances of P282,250.04 as reflected in the Statement of Audit 

Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges (SASDC) remained unsettled as of 
December 31, 2020. 

 
14.1 COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 prescribes the 2009 

Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts (RRSA), which 
provides, among others, that the Auditor shall issue a Notice of 
Disallowance (ND)/Notice of Charge (NC) for differences/balances 
resulting from the audit of the accounts. A Notice of Suspension (NS) may 
be issued pending compliance with various requirements for transactions, 
which may result in pecuniary loss to the government. The suspensions, 
disallowances and charges shall continue to be monitored and enforced by 
COA. 

 

14.2 The beginning balance of unsettled disallowances was P311,638.47, of 
which P29,388.43 was settled during the year, leaving an unsettled balance 
of P282,250.04.  The total amount of unsettled disallowances pertains to the
