EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 
A. Introduction 
 

 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 

(UNESCO) National Commission of the Philippines (UNACOM) came into 

existence by the passage of Republic Act (RA) No. 621 on May 26, 1951. This Act 

has undergone several amendments to streamline its powers, duties, and 

commitments through the years, the latest of which is Executive Order (EO) No. 

850 dated December 1, 1982 implemented by Minister Order No. 25-85 on 

November 6, 1985 directing the Office of the United Nations and International 

Organizations (UNIO) to provide staff support and guidance in the supervision of 

the National Commission. 

 

Today, UNACOM focuses its programs and activities along UNESCO’s 

five fields (also known as sectors) of competence, namely education, science, social 

and human sciences, culture, and communication and information.  

 

UNACOM, chaired by the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, 

is composed of appointive and ex-officio members. The Philippine President 

appoints its 45 members. The Chairman of the Committee on Education, Senate 

and the Chairman of the Committee on Education, House of Representatives serve 

as ex-officio officials. The Chairperson and Commissioners are supported by a 

Secretariat, headed by a Secretary General (also a Presidential appointee). 

 

The personnel complement of UNACOM for CY 2020 consists of 14 

personnel, with 14 regular, and 1 contractual employee.

D.   Scope of Audit 

 

 The audit covered the accounts and operations of the UNACOM for CY 

2020. It was aimed to a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the 

Management’s assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the propriety of 

transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and 

regulations; c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and d) determine 

the extent of implementations of prior year’s recommendations. Moreover, the 

audit was conducted in accordance with International Public Sector Standards on 

Auditing. 

 

 

E.    Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 

 

The auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of presentation 

of the financial statements of the UNACOM. 

 

 

F.   Observations and Recommendations 

 

 The significant audit observations and corresponding recommendations 

were communicated with Management officials concerned through the issuance of 

Audit Observation Memoranda and discussed during the exit conference on May 

19, 2021, details of which are discussed in this report. Management views and 

comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

 

1. Uncorrected prior year erroneous adjustment resulted in the overstatement and 
understatement by ₱93,578.04 of the accounts Office Equipment and 

Information and Communication Technology Equipment (ICTE), respectively, 

and the understatement by ₱82,388.08 and overstatement by ₱52,585.78 of 

Accumulated Depreciation-Office Equipment and Accumulated Depreciation-

ICTE. Moreover, computer software items were provided with a five percent 

residual value, contrary to Section 10, Chapter 12, Volume I of the Government 

Accounting Manual (GAM), understating the Accumulated Amortization 

account by ₱3,095.21. 

 

We reiterated our recommendation and Management agreed to require the 

Accountant to: 

a. correct the prior year erroneous adjustment of the Office Equipment and the 
ICTE accounts; 

b. prepare journal entry voucher (JEV) to record the deficient accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated amortization; and 



iv 

 

c. henceforth, ensure that depreciation charges are correctly computed that are 
supported with schedule of computation and the necessary documents. 

 

2. Of the ₱414,298.48 advanced to Procurement Service-Department of Budget 
and Management (PS-DBM), a total of ₱132,480.45 representing balance of 

undelivered equipment remained idle and unutilized for more than four years.  

Further, confirmation results showed a discrepancy of ₱118,693.48 between 

the UNACOM and PS-DBM books, affecting the reliability on the account’s 

balance as at December 31, 2020. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a. Accountant to: 
 

i. coordinate   with   the   PS-DBM for the reconciliation of   account 
balance; and 

 

ii. periodically monitor the advances to PS-DBM to avoid accumulation 
of balances; and 

 

b. Property Officer to re-order ICTE with the latest version chargeable to the 
undelivered balance. 

 

3. Due to Management’s failure to monitor the liquidation of the funds transferred 

to various National Government Agencies (NGAs) for the implementation of 

the agency’s projects and activities, a total of ₱1,513,365.00 or 78.51 percent 

of Due from NGAs balance of ₱1,927,663.48 remained dormant and non-

moving for 8 years to more than 10 years in the books, affecting the fair 

presentation of the account in the financial statements. 
 

We reiterated our prior year’s audit recommendation that the Accountant: 

 

a. coordinate with the NGAs that replied to the confirmation letters for the 
submission of liquidation documents for proper recording in the books; 

 

b. exhaust all possible means to enforce the settlement of the outstanding 
accounts; and 

 

c. if settlement proved futile, request authority from the Commission on Audit 
to write-off dormant unliquidated fund transfers, strictly in accordance with 

COA Circular 2016-005. 
 
 
 
 



v 

 

4. The procurement of six highly technical professionals/consultants was not 
covered with an approved Annual or Supplemental Procurement Plan for CY 

2020, thereby the payment of ₱1,260,111.07 for their services was contrary 

with the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the RA 

No. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act.  

 

We recommended that Management require the Bids and Awards Committee 

to include all procurement meticulously and judiciously planned in the APP 

and as well as changes thereto. This is to avoid spending government funds 

contrary to the aforementioned law, and to ensure that funds in connection with 

the implementation of government programs and projects are efficiently spent 

as planned. 

 

 

G.       Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 

 

   Of the 27 prior year’s audit recommendations contained in the CY 2019 

Annual Audit Report, 17 recommendations were implemented and 10 were not 

implemented. The details are presented in Part III of this report.
