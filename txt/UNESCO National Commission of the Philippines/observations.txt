 OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
 

A. Financial Audit 
 

Uncorrected prior year erroneous adjustments in PPE   

  

1. Uncorrected prior year erroneous adjustment resulted in the overstatement and 
understatement by ₱93,578.04 of the accounts Office Equipment and ICTE, 

respectively, and the understatement by ₱82,388.08 and overstatement by 

₱52,585.78 of Accumulated Depreciation-Office Equipment and Accumulated 

Depreciation-ICTE. Moreover, computer software items were provided with a 

five percent residual value, contrary to Section 10, Chapter 12, Volume I of the 

GAM, understating the Accumulated Amortization account by ₱3,095.21. 

 

Section 15, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of the GAM provides that financial statements 

shall present fairly the financial position of an entity.  Fair presentation requires the 

faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in 

accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, 

and expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, with appropriate 

disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the financial statements. 

 

In CY 2019, we recommended a reclassification of account Office Equipment 

composed of desktops and laptops totaling ₱93,578.04 to ICTE account.    This was 

an observation contained in CY 2019 AAR, where a discrepancy of ₱93,578.04 was 

noted caused by an erroneous adjustment per JEV No. 01-2019-12-688 dated 

December 31, 2019. 

   

Verification, however, showed that the reclassification was not implemented; 

thus, the CY 2020 balance of Office Equipment account was still overstated and that 

of the ICTE was understated. 

 

In addition, the Accumulated Depreciation of Office Equipment and ICTE was 

understated by ₱82,388.08 and overstated by ₱52,585.78, respectively, computed as 

follows: 

 

Particulars 

Accumulated Depreciation

Over/(Under) (82,388.08) 52,585.78 (29,802.30) 

 

Moreover, fully amortized computer software items with useful life of 5 years 

were provided with a residual value of five percent, contrary to Section 10, Chapter 

12, Volume I of the GAM. The provision states that the residual value of an 



27 

 

intangible asset with a finite useful life shall be assumed to be zero unless: a) there 

is a commitment by a third party to acquire the asset at the end of its useful life; or 

b) there is an active market for the asset, and: (1) residual value can be determined 

by reference to that market; and (2) it is probable that such a market will exist at the 

end of the asset’s useful life, of which said software items have none. 

 

The intangible assets’ balances and their corresponding accumulated 

amortization, as at year-end are as follows: 

 

Computer Software Items Accumulated Amortization 

Office Std 2016 153,425.00 

Software Winvsr-1 29,285.18

Understatement                                                                              3,905.21 

 

The noted errors affected the reported balances as at December 31, 2020 of the 

accounts Office Equipment, ICTE and Computer Software and the Accumulated 

Depreciation/Amortization.  

 

We reiterated our recommendation and Management agreed to require 

the Accountant to: 

 

a. correct the prior year erroneous adjustment of the Office Equipment and 
the ICTE accounts; 

 

b. prepare JEV to record the deficient accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated amortization; and 

 

c. henceforth, ensure that depreciation charges are correctly computed that 
are supported with schedule of computation and the necessary documents. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

Management took note of the recommendations and has instructed the 

Accountant to work on the necessary reclassification and adjustment of entries to be 

recorded within the current year.  

 

 

Doubtful balance of PS-DBM 

 

2. Of the ₱414,298.48 advanced to PS-DBM, a total of ₱132,480.45 representing 
balance of undelivered equipment remained unutilized for more than four 

years.  Further, confirmation results showed a discrepancy of ₱118,693.48 



28 

 

between the UNACOM and PS-DBM books, affecting the reliability on the 

account’s balance as at December 31, 2020.  

 

The agency procured commonly used supplies, equipment and plane tickets 

from the PS-DBM.  As of year-end, the balance of the account accumulated to 

₱414,298.48, out of which a total of ₱132,480.45, representing the difference 

between the amount advanced and the delivered motor vehicle and various ICTE 

equipment in CY 2016, remained unutilized for more than four years, to wit: 

 

Type of Equipment 
Amount 

Advanced 

Amount 

Delivered 
Difference 

Motor vehicle-Toyota Innova 1,045,000.00 1,007,700.00 37,300.00 

Various ICT Equipment  950,000.00 854,819.55 95,180.45 

      Total   132,480.45 

 

The balance of ₱37,300.00 for the motor vehicle was not refunded, while the 

undelivered two printers and network peripherals amounting to ₱95,180.45, under 

the ordered various ICTE, remained with PS-DBM, with no action from the 

UNACOM to re-order the items to maximize the utilization of the approved budget.  

 

To determine the existence and accuracy of the account’s balance of 

₱414,298.48, confirmation letter was sent out to PS-DBM. Per confirmation reply, 

the balance per PS-DBM record amounted to only ₱295,605.00 or a discrepancy of 

₱118,693.48 between the two records, affecting the reliability on the account’s 

balance as at December 31, 2020. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a. Accountant to: 
 

i. coordinate   with   the   PS-DBM for the reconciliation of   account 
balance; and 

 

ii. periodically monitor the advances to PS-DBM to avoid 
accumulation of balances; and 

 

b. Property Officer to re-order ICTE with the latest version chargeable to 
the undelivered balance. 

 

 

Dormant Due from NGAs 

 

3. Due to Management’s failure to monitor the liquidation of the funds transferred 
to various NGAs for the implementation of the agency’s projects and activities, 

a total of ₱1,513,365.00 or 78.51 percent of Due from NGAs balance of 

₱1,927,663.48 remained dormant and non-moving for 8 years to more than 10 



29 

 

years in the books, affecting the fair presentation of the account in the financial 

statements. 

 

Section 5.6 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 defines Dormant Unliquidated 

Fund Transfers as advances granted by the source entity to implementing entity for 

the implementation of program/projects which remained non-moving for ten (10) 

years or more and where settlement could no longer be ascertained.  

 

The COA Circular No. 2016-005 provides guidelines and procedures on the 

write-off of dormant fund transfers of National NGAs to clean their books of 

accounts of dormant receivable accounts and fund transfers for fair presentation of 

accounts in the FSs. Thus, Section 8.3 requires that the request for write-off must be 

supported by proof that the agency exhausted all possible remedies to collect the 

receivables and to demand liquidation fund transfers and other necessary supporting 

documents to support the request. 

 

The UNACOM transferred funds to other NGAs for the implementation of its 

projects/activities related to educational, scientific, cultural matters and other 

UNESCO programs, and for the procurement of supplies and equipment. As at 

December 31, 2020, the account Due from NGAs had a balance of ₱1,927,663.48. 

 

The Audit Team sent confirmation letters to the following NGAs to verify the 

existence and accuracy of the account’s balance, however, only four replied, and 

showed discrepancies aggregating ₱782,345.67.  The confirmation, except for PS-

DBM, yielded the same result for the past 4 years:

30 

 

A total of ₱1,513,365.00 or 78.51 percent has been dormant or non-moving for 

8 years to more than 10 years as a result of Management’s failure to monitor the 

liquidation and reconcile the fund transfers with the concerned NGAs.  
 

The dormancy of the accounts, aggravated by the discrepancy of amounts, 

affected the fair presentation of the financial statements. 

 

This has been an observation contained in the prior years’ Annual Audit 

Reports. 

 

We reiterated our prior years’ audit recommendation that the 

Accountant: 

 

a. coordinate with the NGAs that replied to the confirmation letters for the 
submission of liquidation documents for proper recording in the books;  

 

b. exhaust all possible means to enforce the settlement of the outstanding 
accounts; and 

 

c. if settlement proved futile, request authority from the Commission on 
Audit to write-off dormant unliquidated fund transfers, strictly in 

accordance with COA Circular 2016-005. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

Management acknowledged with appreciation the 2020 Audit Observation 

Memorandum citing the reported balance of Due from NGAs. All recommendations 

are duly noted. For Due from NGAs, particularly the PS DBM account, Management 

will coordinate for the reconciliation of our respective account balance and update 

periodically future payments as against their deliveries 

 

 

B. Compliance Audit 
 

Hiring of Other Professional Services not included in the Annual Procurement Plan 

(APP) 

 

4. The procurement of six highly technical professionals/consultants was not 
covered with an approved Annual or Supplemental Procurement Plan for          

CY 2020, thereby the payment of ₱1,260,111.07 for their services was contrary 

with the 2016 Revised IRR of the RA No. 9184 or the Government Procurement 

Reform Act.  

 

The 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 or the Government Procurement 

Reform Act mandates, among others, the following: 

 



31 

 

7.1. All procurement shall be within the approved budget of the 
Procuring Entity and should be meticulously and judiciously 

planned by the Procuring Entity. Consistent with government 

fiscal discipline measures, only those considered crucial to the 

efficient discharge of governmental functions shall be included 

in the APP.  

 

7.2. No procurement shall be undertaken unless it is in accordance 
with the approved APP, including approved changes thereto. 

The APP must be consistent with the duly approved yearly 

budget of the Procuring Entity and shall bear the approval of 

the HoPE or second-ranking official designated by the HoPE 

to act on his behalf. 

 
During the year, the UNACOM hired six technical professionals/consultants 

and paid a total of ₱1,260,111.07. The six consultants are as follows: 

  

1) Project Convener and Field Coordinator 
2) Policy and Content Developer for the UNACOM’s Gender Development and 

Mainstreaming for UNESCO’s Management of Social Transformation 

(MOST) Program, 
3) Lawyer for the Webinar on the Government Procurement Training 
4) Three Event Documenter for Futures of Education: Learning to Become 

Ideas Lab.  For their services, the agency paid a total of ₱1,260,111.07. 
 

However, verification of the Final APP and the Supplemental APP for CY 2020 

revealed that no technical professional/consultant was to be procured, in violation of 

the aforecited Section 7.2, Rule II of the 2016 Revised IRR of the RA No. 9184. 

 

The failure of the agency to prepare and/or update its APP signifies inadequate 

operational planning and budgeting, and consequently led to the irregular 

procurement or hiring of the six consultants.  

 

 The same observation on the non-compliance with the foregoing Sections 7.1 

and 7.2 of RA No. 9184 has been noted in the previous year, which Management then 

commented that they took note of the recommendations and will adjust the succeeding 

plans, transactions, and procedures in accordance with the prescribed guidelines of 

the aforementioned law. 

 

We recommended that Management require the Bids and Awards 

Committee to include all procurement meticulously and judiciously planned in 

the APP and as well as changes thereto. This is to avoid spending government 

funds contrary to the aforementioned law, and to ensure that funds in 

connection with the implementation of government programs and projects are 

efficiently spent as planned. 
 



32 

 

Management Comment: 

 

Management commented explained that their understanding was that such 

engagement need not be governed by the aforementioned procurement law. 

Consequently, such activity need not be reflected in the agency’s APP with the notion 

that the IRR or RA No. 9184 does not explicitly require that those under COS be 

reflected in the APP.  

 

 

Auditors Rejoinder: 

 

Section 5(i), Rule I of the 2016 Revised IRR of the RA No. 9184 includes 

procurement of consultants, to wit: 

 

Consulting Services. Refer to services for infrastructure projects and other types of 

projects or activities of the GoP requiring adequate external technical and 

professional expertise that are beyond the capability and/or capacity of the GoP to 

undertake such as, but not limited to: (i) advisory and review services; (ii) 

preinvestment or feasibility studies; (iii) design; (iv) construction supervision; (v) 

management and related services; and (vi) other technical services or special studies. 

General principles on Consulting Services are provided for in Annex “B” of this IRR. 

 

We will monitor their compliance with RA No. 9184.  

 

 

C.  Other Areas 
 

COVID-19 Expenses  

 

5. UNACOM paid hazard pay and purchased related health protocol supplies and 
materials totaling ₱366,245.06. These COVID-19-related expenses were supported 

with complete documents, and were incurred based on the conditions set by 

applicable rules and regulations. 

 

 

NTF-ELCAC 

 

6. UNACOM is not a member of NTF-ELCAC and have not received budget allocation 
for CY 2020. 

 

 
Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Programs 

 

7. The UNACOM spent a total of ₱1,840,000.00 for its GAD-related activities for 
CY 2020, which represent 8.54 percent of its total appropriations of 

₱22,728,000.00. However, there is no indication that its CY 2020 GAD Plan and 



33 

 

Budget (GPB) and its GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) were submitted to the 

Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) since it was not barcoded by the 

PCW Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS), and it has no 

signature of the head of agency, as required by Section 7.0 of PCW 

Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2021-03 dated January 20, 2021. 

 

Section 31 of the General Provisions (GP) of the General Appropriations Act 

(GAA) of FY 2020 (RA No. 11465) requires all agencies of the government to 

formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned 

sectors or mandate. The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 

agencies, which shall be at least five percent of their budgets. 

 

The AR for the CY 2020 showed that UNACOM expended the sum of 

₱1,840,000.00 for GAD programs, projects and activities representing 8.54 percent 

of its total appropriations of ₱22,728,000.00. Among the major GAD

However, it must be stressed that even though an AR was submitted to the 

Audit Team, there was no signature of the head of agency. Moreover, there is no 

indication that it was submitted, authenticated, and barcoded by the PCW GMMS, 

as declared by Section 7.0 of PCW Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2020-01. 

Finally, the GPB was submitted only upon request by the Audit Team. 

 

 Section 7.0 of the PCW MC No. 2021-01 declares that FY 2020 GAD ARs 

submitted to PCW shall be authenticated by the GMMS with a barcode. Concerned 

agencies shall print the PCW GMMS-authenticated GAD ARs for signature of their 

agency head, and submit signed copies to PCW and their respective COA Audit 

Team. 

 

We recommended that Management submit to the Audit Team a GPB and 

GAD AR that is signed by the head of agency, endorsed and barcode-

authenticated by PCW, in conformity with PCW MC No. 2021-01. 

 

 
Programs and Projects Related to Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability (PWD) 

 

8. For CY 2020, UNACOM organized an event titled: Futures of Education: Learning 
to Become. 

 

Section 32 of the GP of the GAA of FY 2020 (RA No. 11465) provides that all 

agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to 

address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates 

to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities. 

 

UNACOM organized an event titled: Futures of Education: Learning to 

Become. It recognizes the increasing importance of Education for Sustainable 

Development (ESD). After the adoption of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 

UNACOM aligned with UNESCO in scaling up the promotion of the programme in 

all levels of education. It also participated as Resource Person in the Philippines 

National Launch of 2020 Global Education Monitoring Report held on November 

25, 2020. 

 

 

Compliance with Disaster Risk Reduction and Management and Climate Change 

Adaptation and Mitigation 

  

9. Because of the pandemic, UNACOM personnel did not participate in any earthquake, 
or fire drill.  However, in compliance with Section 36 of the GP of the GAA of FY 

2020 (RA No. 11465), which requires that all agencies of the government shall plan 

and implement programs and projects, taking into consideration measures for climate 

change adaptation and mitigation, and disaster risk reduction, the following 



36 

 

activities, which partially included/involved discussions on climate change and 

disaster risk reductions were participated in by UNACOM, to wit: 

 

1) Published Obra at Pandemya – a collection of poems and artworks that cover 
wide-ranging topics related to the on-going pandemic, including disasters, 

community resilience, and climate resilience, March – April 2020.

Compliance with Tax Laws 

 

10. UNACOM withheld and remitted the required taxes to the Bureau of Internal 
Revenue (BIR), in compliance with DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 1-200 and 

Presidential Memorandum Order No. 219 dated February 13, 1989, amounting to 

₱874,116.60 and ₱926,918.54 respectively. The balance of ₱33,680.56 pertained to 

taxes withheld in December 2020, which was remitted in January 7, 2021. 

 

 

 

 



37 

 

Compliance with GSIS Premium Deductions and Remittances (RA No. 8291) 

 

11. During the year, the total amount of ₱895,035.72 was deducted from the salaries of 
the UNACOM officials and employees representing GSIS contributions and payment 

of loans. The UNACOM consistently remitted the GSIS premiums and loan 

payments on time. However, the negative balance in the amount of ₱43,788.50 

reflected in the FS as of year-end was caused by over deduction of GSIS 

Consolidated Loans, payment of prior year’s unpaid GSIS personal share of three 

personnel, erroneous adjustments and negative beginning balance of ₱38,689.50, 

which was carried forward from prior years. 

 

 

Compliance with Pag-IBIG Fund Contributions (RA No. 9679)  

 

12. During the year, the total amount of ₱74,550.00 was deducted from the salaries of 
UNACOM officials and employees representing Pag-IBIG Contributions. The 

balance reflected in the FS as at December 31, 2020 in the amount of ₱3,928.23 refers 

to prior years’ balance without details and supporting documents. 

 

 

Compliance with PhilHealth Contributions (RA No. 7875) 

 

13. During the year, ₱68,834.81 was deducted from the salaries of the UNACOM 
officials and employees representing PhilHealth contributions. Of this amount, 

₱68,732.45 was remitted as of December 31, 2020. The UNACOM consistently 

remitted the PhilHealth contributions on time. However, the negative balance in the 

amount of ₱1,776.47 reflected in the FS as of year-end was caused by over remittance 

of contribution, erroneous adjustments and negative beginning balance of ₱1,878.83 

which was carried forward from prior years and could not be verified due to absence 

of subsidiary records to support the details of the accounts. 

 

 

Compliance with the Property Insurance Law (RA No. 656) 

 

14. During the year, the total amount of ₱16,891.93 was paid to GSIS to cover the 
insurance of the various equipment, furniture and fixtures and service vehicles owned
