OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

Compliance Issues 

 

Unutilized funds transferred to Procurement Service (PS) – P25.000 million 

 

1. Unutilized fund transferred to the PS for the procurement for the XBRL project 
totaling P25.000 million and unremitted to the BTr tied up the fund with the PS, 

making the same unavailable for use by the NG to finance its operations.   

 

As at December 31, 2020, the subsidiary ledger (SL) of Due from National 

Government Agencies-PS has a balance of P74.657 million. Of this amount, P25.000 

million was for the supply, delivery, installation, configuration, commissioning and 

implementation of a fully functional financial reporting system using eXtensible 

Business Reporting Language System (XBRL), with an approved budget for the 

contract of P15.000 million. The fund was transferred to the PS on June 28, 2017 

under Authority to Debit Account (ADA) No. 06-309-2017 and Agency Procurement 

Request (APR) No. 201611181. 

 

Review of the documents supporting the fund transfer disclosed that on 

August 18, 2017, the Officer-in-Charge (OIC)-Head, Procurement Group I of the PS 

informed the former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) OIC-Director of 

Economic Research Training Department of the price validation conducted by the PS 

that the Approved Budget of the Contract (ABC) of P15.000 million was 

significantly lower compared to the proposals submitted by potential service 

providers/bidders for the said project. Thus, the SEC amended APR No. 201611181 

with an amended total amount of P25.000 million. The additional P10.000 million 

was transferred to the PS on February 13, 2018 through ADA No. 02-058-2018. After 

the transfer of the additional fund, two biddings were conducted by the PS on April 

26, 2018 and July 18, 2018, however, both were declared as failed biddings. There 

has been no bidding for the project as at December 31, 2020. 

 

Management informed that it is waiting for the response of the PS to the SEC 

letter dated March 23, 2021, stating the Commission on Audit (COA) 

recommendation to refund the unutilized fund for the undelivered XBRL project. 

 

The non-utilization of the fund transferred to the PS had unnecessarily tied 

up the funds with the PS, making the same unavailable to the National Government 

(NG) to finance its operations. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Director, 

Financial Management Department (FMD) to: (a) follow up with the PS the 

immediate refund of the fund transfer for the undelivered XBRL project of 

P25.000 million; and (b) remit to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr) the refund of 

the unutilized fund transfer to the PS immediately after receipt.

Payments of EME at inappropriate rates and to unentitled officials 

 

2. Payments of EME at the rates not appropriate for its officials’ ranks and to 
unentitled officials resulted to the overpayment of EME by P1.318 million, 

unnecessarily increasing the agency’s expenses.  

   

Section 42 of Republic Act (RA) No. 11465, or the General Appropriations 

Act (GAA) of Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 provides that appropriations authorized in this 

Act may be used for the annual extraordinary expenses (EE) of the following officials 

with the following ranks and their equivalent, as may be determined by the 

Department of Budget and Management (DBM), not exceeding the amounts 

indicated, among others:  

 

a) P108,000.00 for each Department Undersecretary; 
b) P60,000.00 for each Department Assistant Secretary; and 
c) P45,600.00 for each head of bureau or organization of equivalent rank, 

and for each head of a Department Regional Office xxx. 
 

 In addition, annual miscellaneous expenses (ME) not exceeding P90,000.00 

for each of the offices under the above-named officials and their equivalent are 

authorized herein.  

 

The Personal Services Itemization and Plantilla of Personnel (PSIPOP) for 

CY 2020 of the SEC submitted to the DBM showed 25 key officials, composed of 

the Chairperson, 4 Commissioners, and 11 Directors heading 3 special offices, 5 

operational departments and 3 support departments, all of the Head Office (HO); and 

9 regional extension offices (ExOs) in the cities of Baguio, Tarlac, Legaspi, Iloilo, 

Bacolod, Cebu, Davao, Cagayan de Oro and Zamboanga. 

 

The SEC Office Order No. 406, series of 2018 provides for the guidelines in 

the disbursement of funds for Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses (EME) of 

the SEC Officials, where the EME is granted to the Chairperson, Commissioners and 

Directors of the special offices, operating and support departments in the HO and in 

the ExOs. 

 

For CY 2020, the disbursements for the EE and ME amounted to P1.137 

million and P2.130 million, respectively, or a total of P3.267 million. Analysis of the 

EME rates granted to the SEC officials disclosed that payments were made to the 

following officials based on the following ranks and rates: 

 

a) SEC Chairperson with Salary Grade (SG) 31 considered of equivalent 
rank of a Department Secretary; 

b) SEC Commissioners with SG 30 considered of equivalent rank of a 
Department Undersecretary; 

c) SEC General Counsel considered of equivalent rank of a Head of Bureau 
or organization of equivalent rank; 



 

69 

 

d) SEC General Accountant, Commission Secretary and the Department 
Directors (full-fledged/OIC) considered of equivalent rank of Head of a 

Bureau Regional Office or organization of equivalent rank; and 

e) SEC Directors in the ExOs (acting/OIC) considered of equivalent rank 
of a Municipal Trial Court Judge, Municipal Circuit Trial Court Judge 

and Shari’a Circuit Court Judge.  

 

In a letter to the Division Chief, Organization, Position Classification and 

Compensation Bureau (OPCCB) of the DBM dated February 2, 2021, the Audit 

Team sought clarification on the equivalent rank of the SEC officials for purposes of 

determining the appropriate rates of the EME claimed by the officials. 

 

The reply of the DBM Assistant Secretary, also the Functional Group Head 

of the OPCCB stated that in determining the propriety of the entitlement to EME, the 

organizational equivalence of the unit headed by the official is to be considered. 

Pursuant to Section 1 of Executive Order (EO) No. 37 dated April 19, 2011, the SEC 

was placed under the administrative supervision of the Department of Finance 

(DOF). Hence, it is considered as an intermediate-level agency, which is lower than 

a department but higher than a bureau. Accordingly, only the following officials of 

the SEC with the following equivalent ranks are entitled to the EE and ME at the 

following rates:  

 
Table 1 - Applicable Equivalent Rank of SEC Officials and the Corresponding EE and ME 

Rates 

SEC Official Equivalent Rank per Sec. 42 GAA   Rate of EE       Rate of ME 

SEC Chairperson Department Undersecretary (b) P 108,000.00 P 90,000.00 

SEC Commissioner (4) Department Assistant Secretary (c) 60,000.00 90,000.00 

Director -Special Offices (3) Head of Bureau (d) 45,600.00 90,000.00 

SEC Director – Head Office (8)  Head of Bureau (d) 45,600.00 90,000.00 

 

Likewise, the DBM Assistant Secretary clarified that the Directors of the 

ExOs are not entitled to the EME as said Offices are not considered equivalent to a 

Bureau Regional Office nor to a Municipal Trial Court in the Judiciary.  

 

Following the equivalent ranks applicable to the SEC officials as determined 

by the DBM, the total payments of the EE and ME for CY 2020 should have been 

P0.791 million and P1.328 million, respectively, or a total of P2.119 million, based 

on the actual number of months claimed by the SEC officials. During the year, the 

actual claims for the EE and ME were P1.137 million and P2.130 million, 

respectively or a total of P3.267 million. 
 

The payments of EE and ME at inappropriate rates and to unentitled officials 

resulted to the overpayment of EE and ME by P0.515 million and P0.803 million, 

respectively, or a total of P1.318 million.  

 

We recommended that Management require the Director, FMD to: (a) 

collect the overpayment of EME totaling P1.318 million from the concerned 

SEC officials; and (b) make payments of the EE and ME only to entitled SEC 



 

70 

 

Officials and at the appropriate rates based on their equivalent ranks as 

determined by the DBM.   

 

In its letter to the DBM dated April 27, 2021, Management sought 

clarification from the DBM on the latter’s letter to the State Auditor IV, SEC on the 

entitlement to EME of SEC officials, including Directors of ExOs. 

 

Management maintains its position that the SEC Chairperson and SEC 

Commissioners are of equivalent rank with the Department Secretary and 

Department Undersecretary, respectively, citing Presidential Decree (PD) No. 902-

A, as amended which categorically classified the SEC Chairperson as equivalent in 

rank to a Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeals (CA), and the SEC Commissioners 

as equivalent in rank to the Associate Justices of the CA. Accordingly, the SEC 

Chairperson is legally and statutorily equivalent with that of the Department 

Secretary and the SEC Commissioners as Department Undersecretary. Based on 

previous and existing approved salary schedule of the SEC since the passage of RA 

No. 6758, the SEC Chairperson is and has always been SG-31 which is the same with 

a Presiding Justice of the CA.  

 

Management claimed that the SEC ExOs are likewise entitled to EME 

because of the following reasons: (1) the SEC ExOs carry out functions over one or 

more regional administrative locations which is similar to that of a Head of a 

Department Regional Office as defined in Section 21, Chapter 5, Book IV of EO No. 

292; and (2) the use of the words “Extension Offices” was deliberate because when 

the said ExOs were established, it was intended that the very mandate of the SEC not 

only in the specific regions where the ExOs were situated will be performed, but also 

in the regional administrative locations covered by their jurisdiction. The SEC ExOs 

which are headed by a Director actually performs the mandate of the Revised 

Corporation Code (RCC), Securities Regulation Code (SRC) and other relevant laws 

implemented by the SEC in the regional administrative locations covered by their 

jurisdiction. The SEC ExOs are functionally similar to a Bureau Regional Office and 

is even greater than a Bureau Regional Office in terms of the regional administrative 

locations covered by their jurisdiction. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

The Audit Team maintains that the payments of the EME were not in keeping 

with the rates authorized under the GAA for FY 2020 as to the equivalent ranks 

applied. As determined by the DBM, the SEC Chairperson is equivalent to the 

Department Undersecretary and the SEC Commissioner is equivalent to the 

Department Assistant Secretary.  Moreover, there is no provision in the PD No. 902-

A on the classification of the SEC Chairperson as equivalent in rank to the Presiding 

Justice of the CA.  

 

Likewise, consistent with the DBM interpretation, the SEC PSIPOP is distinct 

from the one adopted by the NG. Thus, the SG assignment of positions in the NG 



 

71 

 

does not squarely apply to the SEC. The SG-31 in the SEC, which is allocated to the 

SEC Chairperson, is not similar with the SG-31 of other national government 

agencies (NGAs), as opposed to the Management’s assertion that the SEC 

Chairperson is equivalent to the Presiding Justice of the CA and Department 

Secretary since both are also SG-31 positions.  

 

It should also be noted that Section 42 of RA No. 11465 made no reference 

to the SGs but rather to the ranks of government officials in prescribing the allowable 

EME such that ranks should be taken into consideration in the grant of the EME and 

not the SGs. 

 

As to Management’s contention that the ExOs are functionally similar to a 

Bureau Regional Office and is even greater than a Bureau Regional Office in terms 

of the regional administrative locations covered by their jurisdiction, we maintain 

our position that the Directors in the ExOs are not entitled to claim EME. The ExOs 

are merely extensions of the Company Registration and Monitoring Department 

(CRMD) in the HO. Thus, the Directors in the SEC ExOs are not entitled to claim 

EME as said Offices are not considered equivalent to a Bureau Regional Office nor 

to a Municipal Trial Court in the Judiciary.  

 

 

Payments of RATA at inappropriate equivalent ranks and rates  

 

3. Payments of RATA at the inappropriate rates for its officials’ ranks resulted to 
the overpayment of RATA by P420,000.00, unnecessarily increasing the 

agency’s expenses. 

 

Section 54 of RA No. 11465, or the GAA for FY 2020, provides for the 

limitations in the grant of representation allowances and transportation allowances 

(RATA). Government Officials with the following ranks and their equivalent, as 

determined by the DBM, while in the actual performance of their respective 

functions, are authorized with monthly commutable RATA at the rates indicated for 

each type of allowance, among others: 
 

Table 2 - Authorized Monthly Rates of RATA per Rank 

Ranks Authorized Rate for RA/TA  

Department Undersecretaries   P 11,000.00 

Department Assistant Secretaries 10,000.00

   Regional Directors, Bureau Regional Directors, and  

   Department Service Chiefs 

8,500.00 

Chief of Divisions, identified as such in the PSIPOP 5,000.00 

 

 Following the equivalent ranks of the SEC Officials as determined by the 

DBM, the SEC being under the administrative supervision of the DOF and is 

considered as an intermediate-level agency, which is lower than a department but 



 

72 

 

higher than a bureau, the following are the equivalent ranks of the SEC Officials and 

the authorized monthly RATA:

Director I and II of SEC ExOs  Chiefs of Divisions, identified as 

such in the PSIPOP 

5,000.00 

 

 

As to the equivalent position of the Directors of the SEC ExOs, the letter reply 

of the DBM Assistant Secretary dated March 19, 2021 stated that the ExOs are not 

considered equivalent to a Bureau Regional Office. Although both the Directors of 

ExOs and a Bureau Regional Director oversee the activities of a field unit in the 

organization, the scope of functions being performed by said two officials and the 

coverage and jurisdiction are vastly different. The Bureau Regional Office serves as 

a point of origin of feedback of information, and as source for performance 

assessment, policy making and program planning, while the ExOs provide support in 

the enforcement and regulatory activities, and cater to the needs of their clients in a 

specific locality of the region. Thus, the Directors of ExOs are only equivalent in rank 

to the Chief of Divisions entitled to RATA at P5,000.00 each and not to the Bureau 

Regional Directors with RATA of P8,500.00 each.  

 

Review of the payments of the RATA in CY 2020 disclosed that the RATA 

granted to several SEC officials were not in accordance with the authorized rates for 

the equivalent ranks of the officials as determined by the DBM. The RATA received 

by SEC officials and the authorized RATA for their equivalent ranks are presented 

in Table 4.

Among others, the SEC Chairperson received RATA equivalent to that of a 

Department Secretary and the Commissioners to an Undersecretary and not at the 

rates of a Department Undersecretary and Department Assistant Secretary, 

respectively. The Directors I and Directors II were paid RATA at rates equivalent to 

that of the Assistant Bureau Regional Directors and Assistant Bureau Directors/ 

Department Assistant Regional Directors/ Bureau Regional Directors/ Department 

Service Chiefs, respectively, instead of rates of Chiefs of Divisions. Total 

overpayment of RATA based on the equivalent ranks and rates used by the SEC 

totaled P420,000.00. 

 

The payments of RATA at inappropriate rates for the officials’ equivalent 

ranks resulted in the overpayment of RA by P390,000.00 and TA by P30,000.00 or 

a total of P420,000.00. 

   

We recommended that Management require the Director, FMD to: (a) 

collect the overpayment of RA and TA by P390,000.00 and P30,000.00, 

respectively; or a total of P420,000.00 from the concerned SEC officials; and (b) 

make payments of RATA to entitled officials at the appropriate rates based on 

their equivalent ranks as determined by the DBM.  

 

  

Delayed disposal of unserviceable PPEs 

 

4. Delayed disposal of unserviceable properties in Davao, Iloilo and Legaspi ExOs 
totaling P2.765 million as at December 31, 2020 exposed the properties to 

further deterioration and decline in value, and consequently, deprived the 

government of the benefits of the most appropriate and advantageous mode of 

disposal.  

 

Section 79 of PD No. 1445 states that when government properties are found 

to be valueless or unsaleable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be 

valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision 

of the proper committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor 

concerned. 



 

74 

 

National Budget Circular No. 425 dated January 28, 1992 prescribing the use 

of the Manual on Disposal of Government Property provides that disposal 

proceedings should be immediately initiated to avoid further deterioration of the 

property and the consequent depreciation in its value, and that the property may be 

disposed thru modes appropriate and deemed most advantageous to the government: 

(a) condemnation/destruction of property; (b) transfer of property; (c) barter; (d) 

donation of property; and (e) sale of property.  

 

Audit disclosed that the unserviceable properties at the Davao, Iloilo and 

Legaspi ExOs totaling P2.765 million have not yet been disposed as at December 31, 

2020. Details are shown in Table 5.

Records showed that in CYs 2018 and 2019, the Inventory and Inspection 

Report of Unserviceable Properties were prepared for these unserviceable properties 

by the said ExOs. In Iloilo ExO, the disposal through donation to the Technical 

Education and Skills Development Authority was scheduled in March 2020, 

however, it was put on hold due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 

pandemic. As to the Davao and Legaspi ExOs, their Disposal Committees are still in 

the process of determining the mode and schedule of disposal of the unserviceable 

properties. 
 

  The delayed disposal of the unserviceable properties exposed the properties 

to further deterioration and reduction in their values, and deprived the government of 

the benefits from the most appropriate and advantageous mode of disposal for the 

properties. Likewise, it resulted to the accumulation of the unserviceable properties 

and requirement for additional storage space.  

 

 We recommended and Management agreed to require the Directors of 

the said ExOs to undertake the immediate disposal of the unserviceable 

properties to derive the best benefits from the disposal.

Lapses in the management of funds held in trust 

 

5. Lapses in the management of funds held in trust totaling P68.433 million as at 
year-end had not enabled the delivery of the funds’ benefits to their rightful 

beneficiaries, including the NG.  

 

Corporate liquidation, as provided under Section 139 of RA No. 11232, states 

that every corporation whose charter expires pursuant to its article of incorporation 

is annulled by forfeiture, or whose corporate existence is terminated in any other 

manner, shall nevertheless remain as a body corporate for three years after the 

effective date of dissolution, for the purpose of prosecuting and defending suits by 

or against it and enabling it to settle and close its affairs, dispose of and convey its 

property, and distribute its assets. At any time during the said three years, the 

corporation is authorized and empowered to convey all of its property to trustees for 

the benefit of stockholders, members, creditors, and other persons in interest.  

 

Further, except as otherwise provided for in Sections 93 and 94 of the RCC, 

upon the winding up of corporate affairs, any asset distributable to any creditor or 

stockholder or member who is unknown or cannot be found shall be escheated in 

favor of the national government.  

   

The SEC created the Special Hearing Panel (SHP) to supervise the 

rehabilitation/liquidation of distressed companies while the Management Committee 

(MC) are created to supervise the same companies without appointed liquidator 

and/or no rehabilitation proceedings were initiated, pursuant to its residual 

jurisdiction provided under Section 5(d) of the PD No. 902-A, as amended, which 

states: 

 

“In addition to the regulatory and adjudicative functions of the SEC over 

corporations, partnerships and other forms of associations registered with it as 

expressly granted under existing laws and decrees, it shall have original and 

exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide cases involving: 

 

a. Xxx  

d. Petitions of corporations, partnerships or associations to be declared in 

the state of suspension of payments in cases where the corporation, 

partnership or association possesses sufficient property to cover all its 

debts but foresees the impossibility of meeting them when they 

respectively fall due or in cases where the corporation, partnership or 

association has no sufficient assets to cover its liabilities, but is under 

the management of a Rehabilitation Receiver or MC created pursuant to 

this Decree.” (Emphasis Supplied) 

 

Under Section 1 of PD No. 1799 s. 1981 dated January 16, 1981, as amended 

by PD 902-A, the management, rehabilitation receiver, board or body was given the 

power to take custody of, and control over, all the existing assets and property of 



 

76 

 

entities under management for purposes, among others, of determining the best way 

to salvage and protect the interests of the investors and creditors. In the CY 2000, 

Section 5(d) of PD No. 902-A, as amended, was repealed by RA No. 8799 or the 

SRC transferred to the Regional Trial Court (RTC), acting as Special Commercial 

Court, the jurisdiction over cases covered under Section 1 of PD No. 1799. However, 

notwithstanding the said repeal, the SRC specifically provided that cases which were 

pending with the SEC prior to its effectivity which were being monitored and 

supervised by the SHP in the exercise of SEC’s residual jurisdiction, shall continue 

to be under SEC’s jurisdiction as stated under Section 5.2 of the SRC. 

 

The Funds Held in Trust are funds that were and/or will be delivered by the 

appointed Rehabilitation Receivers and Liquidators to the SEC in the event that the 

receivership or liquidation is suspended, terminated and/or no known remaining 

claimants are present despite diligent efforts and determination by the Receivers and 

Liquidators. Each fund is managed by the SHP or MC. Consequently, the expected 

functions of the SHPs, among others, after the turnover of the funds are: (1) 

publication of information relating to the disposal of the funds in the newspaper of 

the general circulation and SEC website; (2) notification of claimants/beneficial 

owners, if identified, through sending letters to their last known addresses or 

publication in newspapers of general circulation; and (3) verification of the identity 

of the claimants and the processing of the claims. On the other hand, the function of 

the MC is to supervise the funds in the event that no rehabilitation proceedings have 

commenced or if there is a rehabilitation proceeding but no liquidator was assigned. 

 

Review of the SEC Notes to the Financial Statements (FSs) for the year ended 

December 31, 2020 showed that the balance of the Funds under 

Receivership/Liquidation totaled P68.433 million. Details are presented in Table 6.

These funds are held in trust for 15 distressed companies, to which the SEC 

had retained its jurisdiction for all pending rehabilitation cases or claims filed before 

it, prior to the transfer to the Courts of general jurisdiction or the appropriate RTC 

pursuant to Section 5.2 of the SRC.  

 

During the year, the Audit Team made several inquiries with the concerned 

SHPs and MC, which supervised the various funds held in trust, to document and 

obtain understanding of these funds, as well as to establish the status of the beneficial 

owners or claimants, and the dormancy of these funds. 

 



 

77 

 

As earlier discussed, the provisions of the RCC and SRC clearly show the 

mandate and residual jurisdiction of the SEC over these funds which are managed by 

SHPs or MC, however, there were no specific manuals, memoranda or systems of 

procedures and manner of notification and mode of publication of claims to the 

public that would serve as basis for the speedy processing and disposition of claims. 

Only one out of three SHPs had provided guidelines on the processing of claims 

while the MC did not provide guidelines because the rehabilitation proceedings have 

not commenced yet due to unknown claimants.  

 

Moreover, evaluation of the responses by the SHPs and MC to our inquiries 

showed lapses in the management of the funds held in trust, as follows:  

 

a. Only two SHPs have provided information on the status of claimants for each 
fund that would facilitate the execution of necessary actions for the 

disposition of the funds held in trust. The claimants against the funds held in 

trust for various companies were unknown or even if identified or known, no 

claims had been filed with the SEC. Details are shown in Table 7.

Various brokers and dealers Client-Investors Identified  

Metropolitan Life Plan Inc. Plan Holders Identified 

Various companies Beneficial owners Unknown 

 

For the fund held in trust for Wise Capital and Investment and Trust 

Co., the SEC MC could not determine whether the fund is intended for 

distribution to the plan holders or the same pertains to the investment with the 

Pryce Corporation. The liquidator did not provide any list of plan holders or 

claimants when it turned over the fund to the SEC in CY 2015. Since then, 

there has been no claim filed with the SEC.  

 

The funds of various brokers and dealers are those of Marino Olondriz 

Y Cia, Asian Capital Equities, Inc., Sung Hung Kai Securities, Sapphire 

Securities Inc. and Guoco Securities Phils. Inc. Records showed that although 

the claimants were identified, only one claim pertaining to one fund out of 

the five funds held in trust had been processed in the last four years. No 

information could be provided by the SHP on instances of publication or 

notification to client-investors on the filing of claims with the SEC. 

 

For the Metropolitan Life Plan Inc., its proposal of distribution through 

a buy-back scheme was submitted to the SEC after it ceased operations and 

its primary registration had been revoked. In CY 2008, the SEC approved the 

proposed distribution of the fund to the plan holders/beneficiaries in 

accordance with the buy-back scheme. There were 2,007 plan holders, 347 of 

whom already received their claims, thus, 1,660 are still due for settlement. 



 

78 

 

Publication or notification to plan holders on the filing of claims was made in 

CY 2011, according to the SHP, but no further notification was made 

thereafter.  

 

Lastly, for the funds held in trust for various companies, namely (1) 

Alemar’s Sibal & Son’s Inc.; (2) Capital Funding and Fin. Corp.; (3) 

Futurelink Futures (Phils.) Inc.; (4) Mercantile Financing Corp.; (5) Omnibus 

Group of Companies; (6) Santa Maria and Company; (7) Connel Securities 

Inc.; and (8) Cebu Packaging Products Co., Inc., no list of the beneficial 

owners has been provided by the liquidator to the SEC. No information on 

the publication or notification to beneficial owners on the filing of claims 

could be provided by the SHP. 
                    

b. There was no existing system of procedures for all or each fund/s held in trust, 
among others, on the notification to claimants of their claims, as well as the 

mode of publication. There was also no proper turnover of accountabilities 

and records, in cases when previous SHPs or MC had retired or were no 

longer with the Commission, such that records for bank signatories were not 

updated, among others. Thus, the proper discharge of the funds held in trust 

and distribution of claims were adversely affected as evidenced by the notably 

low level of claims against the funds held in trust in the last four years. Claims 

for the funds from various brokers and dealers from CYs 2017-2020 totaled 

only P12,920.40 while remaining funds as at year-end totaled 

P42,552,798.88. Claims against the funds from Metropolitan Life Plan Inc. 

for the same period totaled only P60,850.00, with a remaining fund balance 

at year-end of P5,091,593.92. The rest of the funds are without claims for the 

same period. 
 

c. The funds held in trust were already idle for a period ranging from 10 to 36 
years as shown in Table 8.

The funds had remained idle due to unknown beneficial owners and 

insufficient notification by the SEC on the filing of claims by the plan 

holders/beneficial owners/client-investors. 
 

The SHPs did not provide information on whether the idle funds held in trust 

have been referred to the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) for appropriate 

escheat proceedings in favor of the NG or whether such proceedings have been 

started.  
 

Based on the data gathered, the SEC through its SHPs and MC had not taken 

all the reasonable and necessary steps to manage and dispose the funds held in trust. 

While funds had been idle for so many years, escheat proceedings for the transfer of 

the idle funds in favor of the NG, where appropriate, had not been initiated. 

Accordingly, the interest of the claimants such as the beneficial owners, plan holders 

and client – investors were not properly safeguarded and funds already due to the NG 

have not been transferred for its use. The SHPs and MC informed that there was 

generally no set of procedures on the management of the funds, detailing procedures 

for notification for filing of claims by beneficiaries/claimants and escheat 

proceedings, among others. 
 

The lapses in management of the funds held in trust in view of the lack of 

adequate and robust sets of procedures that will ensure the proper management and 

disposal of the funds had resulted in the non-delivery of the funds benefits to its 

rightful beneficiaries, including the NG. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the SHP to: (a) 

require the liquidators/receivers to provide the updated information of the plan 

holders/beneficial owners or claimants against the funds held in trust to come 

up with a database that will facilitate the disposal of the fund balances, where 

appropriate; (b) issue notification on the filing of claims and make regular 

publication to expedite the disposal of the fund balances, where appropriate; 

and (c) determine idle funds for escheat and refer the same to the OGC for the 

initiation of escheat proceedings in favor of the Government in accordance with 

the Rules of Court. 

 



 

80 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to direct the MC to 

resolve the issue whether the funds pertain to investment with Pryce 

Corporation or intended for distribution to the plan holders and to facilitate the 

rehabilitation proceedings, when appropriate. 
 

We also recommend that Management put in place adequate and robust 

sets of procedures for the management of the funds held in trust, including 

monitoring and reporting thereon, to ensure that the funds’ benefits are 

delivered to the intended beneficiaries at the shortest time possible. 

 

Management informed that proper disposition including the initiation of 

escheat proceedings as warranted, pertaining to the six funds, were already referred 

to the OGC. As to the remaining funds held in trust, the same are under review by 

the SEC SHP and MC if escheat proceedings would also be appropriate.

6. COVID-19-Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 
 

Relative to RA No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act and pursuant 

to DOF-DBM Joint Circular (JC) No. 1 dated March 30, 2020 re: Guidelines and 

Procedures for the Implementation of RA No. 11469, the SEC was informed by the 

BTr that portion of its fund will be taken by the NG for the COVID-19 

response/recovery. On March 31, 2020, the amount of P2.000 billion deposited in a 

current account of the SEC with the LBP was transferred to the BTr.  

 

For CY 2020, the SEC had not received funds specifically for COVID-19 

response and/or recovery but had utilized its budget for related expenses. The 

COVID-19-related expenses charged to Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses 

(MOOE) and Capital Outlay totaled P2.060 million and P15,000.00, respectively. 

Details are presented in Table 9.

On the provision of supplies/materials for hazard control 

 

Paragraph B, Section VI of Administrative Order No. 2020-0015 of the 

Department of Health (DOH) on Risk-based Public Health Standards Across Settings 

provides that at the minimum, all actors shall implement the prescribed interventions 

in various settings depending on their Risk Severity Grading. For each prescribed 

intervention, concrete examples of corresponding hazard controls [e.g. engineering 

control, administrative control, and personal protective equipment’s (PPE)] are 

provided. For administrative controls and PPE for offices/workplace, the list includes 

provision of tissue, masks, among others. On the other hand, engineering and 

administrative controls include placement of handwashing facilities, hand sanitizers 

and dispensers with alcohol-based solution in all entrances, exits and areas with high 

foot traffic and facilities. 

 

Review of Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Expenses, Other 

Supplies and Materials Expenses and Other Maintenance and Operating Expenses, 

among others, showed that the SEC procured facemasks, face shields, and various 

health and safety protective and hygienic supplies and conducted the regular 

disinfection of the SEC HO and ExOs for a total cost of P2.060 million. Included in 

the total cost of P2.060 million are the expenses related to the conduct of Rapid Test 

and Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for its employees 

and outsourced personnel to mitigate the spread of the virus. One disinfection 

equipment costing P15,000.00 was procured by the Bacolod ExO and recognized 

under Office Equipment. 

 

        On the provision of transportation facilities to employees on skeleton workforce  

 

Item d, Section 4.0 of Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum 

Circular No. 18, s. 2020 states that reasonable transportation facilities and housing 

quarters shall be provided to employees assigned as skeleton workforce, whenever 

practicable, and subject to budgeting, accounting and auditing rules and regulations. 

 

The SEC provided transportation facilities/shuttle services to help its 

employees in reporting to work during the Enhanced Community Quarantine 

(ECQ)/Modified ECQ when public transportation was limited or not yet available. 

The eight transportation facilities/shuttles totaling P12.640 million were donated by 

Philippine-SEC Institute Foundation, Inc. on November 11, 2020.

7. Gender and Development (GAD) 
 

The original GAD budget amounted to P7.273 million or 0.62 per cent of the 

total agency budget of P1.181 billion for CY 2020, while the actual GAD 

expenditures amounted to P60.184 million or a budget utilization rate of 827.55 per 

cent.  

 

Evaluation of the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and GAD Accomplishment 

Report (AR) for CY 2020 disclosed that of the 29 planned activities, 17 were 

implemented and the remaining 12 activities were partially implemented due to 

COVID-19. Variances between the budget and actual expenditures for the following 

implemented GAD activities, among others, are presented in Table 10.

The noted variances totaling P52.911 million were mainly attributable to the 

salary attributions which were not considered in the preparation of the GPB. 

According to the member of the GAD Focal Point System, it was only at the time of 

the implementation of the GAD activities that the attribution of salaries was 

considered so that the programs, activities and projects identified only have a total 

budget of P7.273 million, thus, the huge variance. However, in the SEC CY 2021 

GPB, the salary attribution was already considered. 

 

 

8. Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs) 
 

The Commission established the SEC Queuing System. This provides better 

quality service and comfort for all public/clients transacting with the CRMD, FMD-

Cashier and Receiving Unit, Electronic Record Management Division. More 

importantly, it has a special lane for SCs and PWD clients. After the SCs and PWD 

clients received a ticket number according to the requested transaction, comfortable 

seating facilities and multimedia display in the SEC lobby that displays the queue 

ticket numbers for each available counter are available for their convenience. 

 

 

9. Tax Laws and Regulations, GSIS and Pag-IBIG Premium Contributions and

taxes, and with the remittance within the prescribed period of the other mandatory 

deductions, premiums/contribution, and loan amortizations pursuant to the 

regulations issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), Government Service

For the contributions/loan payments to the GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth, 

the total amounts withheld were not totally remitted within the prescribed period due 

to the non-acceptance by the GSIS and PhilHealth computerized systems of the 

remittances. However, in February 2021, records of the SEC employees were already 

updated in the system of the GSIS/PhilHealth and the corresponding remittances 

were accepted. Moreover, for the remaining balances of Due to GSIS, Pag-IBIG and 

PhilHealth, the vouchers for the remittance were already prepared by the Accounting 

Division. 

 

On the withholding and remittances of taxes to the BIR, the following were 

observed: 

 

a. Non-withholding of percentage taxes from the payments to consultants and of 
income taxes at the prescribed rates amounting to P207,550.00 

 

Revenue Memorandum Order No. 8-2003 dated March 3, 2003 issued on 

April 1, 2003 identifies government officials designated as withholding agents 

personally responsible for the correct withholding and timely remittance of taxes on 

compensation, expanded and final withholding tax, as well as government money 

payments to persons registered as Non-Value-Added-Tax (Non-VAT) and VAT 

taxpayers. In the NGAs, said designated officials are Heads of Offices (officials 

holding highest position) and Chief Accountants or other persons holding similar 

position. 

   

 Section 5.116 of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98 provides that offices 

and instrumentalities of the government making any money payment to private 

individuals, corporations, partnerships and/or associations are required to deduct and 

withhold the taxes due from the payees on account of such money payments: 

 



 

85 

 

(A) Internal revenue taxes required to be withheld. – Percentage taxes on gross 
money payments, to the following shall be subjected to withholding at the 

rates herein prescribed:  

 

(1) Persons exempt from VAT – On gross payments to persons who are 

exempt under Section 109 (z) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 

1997 (RA No. 8424) from payment of value-added tax and who is not a 

VAT registered person except payment to cooperatives – Three (3) per cent. 
 

Under Section 2 of RR No. 11-2018, individual payees whose gross 

receipts/sales in a taxable year shall not exceed P3.000 million, are required to submit 

a sworn declaration of his/her gross receipts/sales (Annex B1 of RR 11-2018), 

together with a copy of Certificate of Registration (COR), to all the income 

payor/withholding agents not later than January 15 of each year or at least prior to 

the initial payment of the professional fees/commissions/ talent fees, etc. in order for 

them to be subject to five per cent.  The 10 per cent withholding tax rate shall be 

applied in the following cases: (1) the payee failed to provide the income 

payor/withholding agent of such declaration; or (2) the income payment exceeds 

P3.000 million, despite receiving the sworn declaration from the income payee.  

  
Withholding Tax on Government Money Payments - Percentage Taxes is the 

tax withheld by NGAs and instrumentalities, including government-owned and 

controlled corporations and local government units, before making any payments to 

non-VAT registered taxpayers/suppliers/payees. 

 

The SEC hired 11 highly technical consultants who are professionals with 

monthly rates ranging from P55,000.00 to P157,000.00 for services on the (a) SEC 

Disaster Management Plan; (b) Improvement of the Company Registration System; 

(c) Technology Modernization of SEC; (d) Review and assessment of SEC’s 

Procurement Proficiency, Practices and Policies; (e) Compensation Benefits of SEC; 

(f) Review, reporting and analysis of SEC Financial Matters; (g) Management of the 

on-going development of the Company Investments and Financial Statistics System 

(CIFSS); (h) Systems and Micro-Services Development;  (i) JAVA Back-end and 

Database Development; and (j) Development of a Quality Management System.  The 

payments to the 11 consultants for CYs 2019 and 2020 amounted to P0.557 million 

and P7.038 million, respectively or a total P7.595 million. The income taxes withheld 

from the payments to these consultants for CY 2019 and 2020 amounted to 

P56,000.00 and P0.504 million, respectively, or a total of P0.560 million.  

 

Audit of the payments to the consultants for CY 2020 disclosed inconsistent 

application of the tax rates as one consultant was taxed only at two per cent for the 

payments of consultancy services for December 10, 2019 to September 09, 2020 and 

at a rate of 10 per cent for income tax on payments for September 10, 2020 to 

December 9, 2020. Payments in CY 2020 for services rendered in CY 2019 by three 

consultants totaling P0.600 million were not subjected to creditable withholding 

taxes on income. 



 

86 

 

According to the concerned Accounting personnel, the consultants had not 

submitted the Sworn Declaration of gross receipts/sales. However, Management 

informed that three of the consultants submitted their sworn declarations. 

Consequently, the remaining eight consultants, as professionals, who did not submit 

the Sworn Declaration of gross receipts/sales were taxed at 10 per cent creditable 

withholding tax on income instead of at five per cent but Management did not 

withhold the three per cent percentage tax. 

 

The non-withholding of the income taxes at the appropriate rates and of the 

percentage taxes resulted in the under-withholding and under-remittance of income 

and percentage taxes of P58,000.00 and P149,550.00, respectively, or a total of 

P207,550.00.  

      

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Director, FMD 

and the Assistant Director, FMD/Chief Accountant to: (a) inform the 

consultants of the tax due and advise them to immediately settle their tax 

liabilities with the BIR; (b) deduct the under-withholding of taxes from the 

subsequent claims of the consultants, where applicable; and (c) withhold the 

applicable and correct amount of taxes on the payments to consultants based on 

existing revenue regulations and remit the same to the BIR. 

 

b. Remittance of taxes withheld totaling P93.957 million through the TRA  

 

Revenue Regulations No. 1-2013 dated January 23, 2013 mandatorily 

mandated the NGAs to use the Electronic Filing and Payment System (eFPS) wherein 

tax returns are filed electronically and the Electronic Tax Remittance Advice (eTRA) 

is accomplished online. The eTRA shall be the basis for the BIR and the BTr to draw 

a Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to recognize the tax collection and deposit in their 

respective books of accounts. 

 

The Tax Remittance Advice (TRA) is a serially-numbered document 

prescribed by the DBM for use by the NGAs in the remittance of taxes withheld from 

payments made against allotments and cash allocations released by the DBM based 

on the appropriation of an agency. An eTRA is a TRA which is accomplished online 

via the BIR’s eFPS facility. 

 

Under Section 7 of RR No. 1-2013, the use of the eTRA as payment is limited 

only to the NGA’s tax liabilities arising from the use of funds from the DBM. The 

NGA’s tax liabilities arising from the use of funds other than those coming from 

DBM must be paid in cash through the bank debit system of the Authorized Agent 

Bank where the NGA shall enroll for this purpose. 

 

Starting January 2020, the SEC is no longer among the government agencies 

specifically appropriated with funds under RA No. 11465, or the GAA of FY 2020. 

Instead, as provided in the Special Provisions No. 2 of the appropriation of the DOF-

Office of the Secretary, the SEC is authorized to maintain a separate account for the 



 

87 

 

amounts collected from fees, fines and other charges and utilization of the same 

pursuant to RA No. 11232 or the RCC of the Philippines and its implementing rules 

and regulations.  For this purpose, the DBM and SEC issued JC No.1, s. 2020 dated 

September 8, 2020 on the utilization of retained funds of the SEC.  Fees retained by 

the SEC are maintained in separate current accounts with the LBP. 

 

Review of the remittances of taxes withheld by the SEC recognized in the 

books of the Internally Generated Income (IGI) disclosed remittances of taxes 

withheld for the period December 2019 to November 2020 totaling P93.957 million 

through the use of eTRA instead of cash through the bank debit system. The 

documents attached to the JEVs showed that the SEC filed tax returns, selected eTRA 

as type of payment and filled up the amount intended for the TRA instead of selecting 

bank transfer and submitted the same through the eFPS of the BIR. On January 19 

and 20, 2021, the SEC remitted taxes totaling P93.957 million directly to the BTr 

through the LBP. 

 

Following the existing revenue regulations, the use of the eTRA for the 

remittance of withholding taxes is limited only to the NGA’s tax liabilities arising 

from the use of funds based on appropriation. As the SEC is no longer provided 

appropriation as it has been authorized to use its collections, the remittance in cash 

of taxes withheld from payments from the IGI sourced from the current accounts 

with the LBP through the bank debit system is the appropriate method of tax 

remittance. 

 

According to the concerned Accounting personnel, the remittance through 

eTRA in the EFPS was the advice of the BIR Revenue District Office (RDO) having 

jurisdiction over the SEC. The personnel from the BIR National Office, however, 

explained that the RDO might not have been apprised that starting CY 2020, based 

on DBM-SEC JC No.1, s. 2020, the budget of the SEC is sourced from its retained 

income and not from appropriation from the NG, thus, the SEC was not properly 

advised.   

 

Since the eTRA was used by the SEC, the BIR recognized income with a 

debit to Cash-Tax Remittance Advice and credit to Income Tax and Business Tax. 

The Cash-Tax Remittance Advice was closed at year-end to Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit). Thus, the income reported by the BIR was in excess by P93.957 

million which affected the accuracy of the balances of the affected accounts in its 

FSs. 

 

Moreover, included in the revenues and expenses recognized by the BTr for 

TRAs of NGAs under Tax Remittance Advice and Subsidy to National Government 

Agencies was the TRA of P93.957 million erroneously filed by the SEC through the 

EFPS also affecting the accuracy of the balances of the affected accounts in the BTr-

NG’s FSs.

In effect, the SEC had not made the remittance to the BIR of taxes withheld 

with the use of the TRA as it was not authorized to use the same in the absence of 

appropriation from the NG. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Assistant 

Director, FMD/Chief Accountant to: (a) coordinate with the LBP regarding the 

enrolment on the use of the e-payment system in the remittance to the BIR of 

taxes withheld from payments from the IGI; and (b) remit taxes withheld from 

payments from the IGI through the bank debit system of the LBP. 

 

We also recommend that Management require the Assistant Director, 

FMD/Chief Accountant to communicate to the BTr and the BIR the erroneous 

use of the TRA for the tax remittance of P93.957 million to facilitate the 

adjustment of recognized revenues and expenses in CY 2020 in the books of the 

BTr and the BIR. 

 

 

10. GSIS Property Insurance Law 
 

In compliance with RA No. 656, all insurable assets and properties of the SEC 

were insured with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS. For CY 2020, total 

insurable assets of P597.799 million were insured at premiums totaling P2.661 

million. 

 

 

11. Hiring of Casuals, Job Orders, Contractuals and Consultants 
  

For CY 2020, the SEC hired and renewed the contracts of 170 CoS personnel, 

to augment its workforce, in accordance with CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2, 

s. 2020 dated October 20, 2020 on Updated Rules and Regulations Governing CoS 

and Job Order Workers in the Government, as amended. 

 

Relative to the previous year’s recommendations, the SEC undertook the 

review of its human resource complement. Foremost, the SEC already reviewed its 

functions, systems and procedures, organizational structure and staffing and has been 

facilitating its recruitment, selection and placement process to fill up its remaining 

vacant plantilla positions to meet its needed personnel complement.  It also appointed 

24 existing qualified CoS personnel to permanent positions. Lastly, the CoS 

personnel performed functions mainly to assist the regular employees.
