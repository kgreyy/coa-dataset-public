C. Scope and Objectives of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial accounts and operations of SEC for CY 2020.  The 

audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on 

management’s assertion on the financial statements (FSs); (b) determine the propriety 

of transactions, as well as the extent of the agency’s compliance with laws, rules, and 

regulations; (c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and, (d) determine 

the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations. 

 

 

D. Audit Methodology 
 

We adopted a risk-based approach in the audit of the FSs of the SEC and in the review 

of compliance with laws, rules, and regulations.  The Audit Team which carried out 

the audit, among others: (i) examined financial and accounting procedures adopted by 

the SEC and other relevant documentation; (ii) assessed internal controls regulating 

financial operations; (iii) conducted substantive testing of a representative sample of 

selected transactions; (iv) carried out review, on test check basis, of a number of 

contracts and transactions related to movements in balances of assets, liabilities, 

revenues, and expenses; and, (v) conducted interviews and held discussions with the 

concerned officials and staff  in the agency. 

 

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and the 

concerned officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda. 

 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

We rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of SEC’s FS as at 

December 31, 2020.   

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

Among the audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in Part 

II of this report, the significant ones are summarized as follows:  

 

1. Unutilized fund transferred to the Procurement Service (PS) for the procurement 
for the eXtensible Business Reporting Language System (XBRL) project totaling 

P25.000 million and unremitted to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) tied up the 

fund with the PS, making the same unavailable for use by the National Government 

(NG) to finance its operations.   

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Director, Financial 

Management Department (FMD) to: (a) follow up with the PS the immediate 

refund of the fund transfer for the undelivered XBRL project of P25.000 



 

iv 

 

million; and (b) remit to the BTr the refund of the unutilized fund transfer to 

the PS immediately after receipt. 

 

2. Payments of Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses (EME) at the rates not 
appropriate for its officials’ ranks and to unentitled officials resulted to the 

overpayment of EME by P1.318 million, unnecessarily increasing the agency’s 

expenses.  

  

We recommended that Management require the Director, FMD to: (a) collect 

the overpayment of EME totaling P1.318 million from the concerned SEC 

officials; and (b) make payments of the extraordinary expenses and 

miscellaneous expenses only to entitled SEC Officials and at the appropriate 

rates based on their equivalent ranks as determined by the Department of 

Budget and Management (DBM). 

 

3. Payments of representation allowances and transportation allowances (RATA) at 
the inappropriate rates for its officials’ ranks resulted to the overpayment of RATA 

by P420,000.00, unnecessarily increasing the agency’s expenses. 

 

We recommended that Management require the Director, FMD to: (a) collect 

the overpayment of RA and TA by P390,000.00 and P30,000.00, respectively; 

or a total of P420,000.00 from the concerned SEC officials; and (b) make 

payments of RATA to entitled officials at the appropriate rates based on their 

equivalent ranks as determined by the DBM. 

 

4. Lapses in the management of funds held in trust totaling P68.433 million as at year-
end had not enabled the delivery of the funds’ benefits to their rightful beneficiaries, 

including the NG. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Special Hearing 

Panel to: (a) require the liquidators/receivers to provide the updated 

information of the plan holders/beneficial owners or claimants against the 

funds held in trust to come up with a database that will facilitate the disposal 

of the fund balances, where appropriate; (b) issue notification on the filing of 

claims and make regular publication to expedite the disposal of the fund 

balances, where appropriate; and (c) determine idle funds for escheat and 

refer the same to the Office of the General Counsel for the initiation of escheat 

proceedings in favor of the Government in accordance with the Rules of Court. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to direct the Management 

Committee to resolve the issue whether the funds pertain to investment with 

Pryce Corporation or intended for distribution to the plan holders and to 

facilitate the rehabilitation proceedings, when appropriate. 

 

We also recommend that Management put in place adequate and robust sets 

of procedures for the management of the funds held in trust, including 



 

v 

 

monitoring and reporting thereon, to ensure that the funds’ benefits are 

delivered to the intended beneficiaries at the shortest time possible. 

 

5. Remittance of taxes withheld totaling P93.957 million through the use of Tax 
Remittance Advice (TRA) instead of paying in cash through the bank debit system 

of the Authorized Agent Bank resulted in the non-remittance of the taxes withheld 

as SEC is not authorized to use TRA in the absence of appropriation. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Assistant Director, 

FMD/Chief Accountant to: (a) coordinate with the Land Bank of the 

Philippines (LBP) regarding the enrolment on the use of the e-payment system 

in the remittance to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) of taxes withheld 

from payments from the Internally Generated Income (IGI); and (b) remit 

taxes withheld from payments from the IGI through the bank debit system of 

the LBP. 

 

We also recommend that Management require the Assistant Director, 

FMD/Chief Accountant to communicate to the BTr and the BIR the erroneous 

use of the TRA for the tax remittance of P93.957 million to facilitate the 

adjustment of recognized revenues and expenses in CY 2020 in the books of 

the BTr and the BIR. 

 

The aforementioned observations and the corresponding recommendations were 

communicated to concerned agency officials through the issuance of the CY 2020 

Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations, and Summary of Prior Years’ 

Not Implemented Recommendations in lieu of an exit conference. Management’s 

response was received on May 20, 2021, and its views and comments were 

incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

 

 

G. Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges  
 

There were no Notices of Suspension (NSs), Disallowances (NDs) and Charges (NCs) 

issued in CY 2020.  Notice of Disallowance No. 17-001-001-(16-17) on the payments 

for the lease of portions of PICC Building used as the SEC’s head office amounting to 

P99.902 million was settled in view of the COA Decision No. 2019-047 dated May 

22, 2019 lifting the ND. The details of the disallowances under various NDs unsettled 

as at December 31, 2020 amounting to P166.431 million are shown in Part II of this 

report.  

 

 

H. Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations

implemented, while 11 or 34.37 per cent were not implemented.  The details on the 

status of implementation are discussed in Part III of this report. 

 



 

vi

agency.
