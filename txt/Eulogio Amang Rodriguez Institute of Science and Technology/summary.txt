EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

A. Introduction 

The Eulogio “Amang” Rodriguez Institute of Science and Technology (EARIST) 

was founded in 1945 as a vocational high school and was converted into a state Institute 

by virtue of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1524 enacted on June 11, 1978. 

 

The EARIST is envisioned to be a center of excellence in trades, business, arts, 

and science and technology education through its mission to turn out vocationally, 

technically, technologically, and scientifically trained graduates who will be 

economically productive, self-sufficient, effective, responsible and disciplined citizens. 

Its goal is to provide professional, scientific, technological, technical and vocational 

institution and training in trades, business, arts, sciences and technology and for special 

purposes, promote research, advanced studies and progressive leadership. 

  

The Institute is headed by Dr. Editha V. Pillo as President. The President is 

assisted by three Vice Presidents, Directors of the Administrative Offices and Deans of 

the Academe. It is governed by a Board of Trustees (BOT) with Commission on Higher 

Education (CHED) Commissioner Ronald L. Adamat, as the Chairperson, assisted by the 

EARIST President as Vice-Chairperson and eight members. On the other hand, the 

EARIST Cavite Campus (ECC) located at General Mariano Alvarez, Cavite is managed 

by Dr. Agnes N. Coo as ECC Administrator. 

 

The Institute maintains only one set of books of accounts for the Main Campus in 

Manila and its Extension Office in Cavite. 

 

In implementing its vision, mission, and goals, the Institute has 495 plantilla 

positions, 407 or 82 percent of which are from EARIST while the remaining 88 or 18

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the review/examination of the accounts and operations of the 

EARIST for CY 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) ascertain the level of assurance 

that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) 

determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with 

applicable laws, rules and regulations; and (c) determine the extent of implementations of 

prior years’ audit recommendations. 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the 

financial statements of the EARIST for CY 2020 for reasons stated in the Independent 

Auditor’s Report in Part I and as discussed in Part II of this Report.  

 

F. Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

 The following are among the significant audit observations and recommendations, 

which were discussed in detail in Part II – Observations and Recommendations of this 

Report: 

 

1. Various accounts under the Assets, Liabilities and Equity categories have 
misstatements totaling P28,647,430.80, representing 2.65 percent of its total Assets of 

P1,082,389,622.75 as at December 31, 2020. Due to the significant impact of said 

misstatements on the reported balances of the affected accounts, the accuracy, 

completeness and existence of the said accounts could not be relied upon. 

(Observation No. 1) 

 

We recommended that the Management/Accountant prepare the necessary 

adjusting journal entries to correct and adjust the above misstatements to reflect 

the accurate balances of the affected accounts. 

 

2. The aggregate balance of P1,250,457,612.16 of accounts Due from NGAs, 
Receivables, Inventories, Advances, Property, Plant and Equipment and Accumulated 



vi 

 

Surplus/(Deficit) as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable and of doubtful validity due 

to accounting and property control deficiencies. (Observation No. 2) 
 

We recommended that Management: 
 

a. reconcile Accounting records of EARIST with the DBM-PS Party Ledger 
Card to ascertain the causes of the discrepancies and communicate the same 

to the Accountant of the DBM-PS for proper adjustments of the two records 

in order to reflect the correct balance of the advances of EARIST; 
 

b. provide all necessary supporting documents to the adjustments made to Due 
from NGAs account amounting to P6,430,659.88, otherwise, reverse previous 

entry made;

documents pertaining to the accounts in order to establish and identify the 

names of the accountable persons and/or entity from whom those receivables 

are to be collected;

review if the recognition previously made is aligned with the policy, 

otherwise, reverse the entries made and recognize Allowance for Impairment 

based on the set guidelines; 
 

f. recognize and record in the books the Inventories upon purchase or delivery 
thereof and record expenses upon distribution in compliance with the accrual 

method of accounting to prevent over/understatement of accounts; 
 

g. review the non-moving balance of Inventory sub-accounts carried in the 
books for several years and check for possible derecognition/write-down 

within one month from receipt hereof; 
 

h. conduct physical count of inventories and submit RPCI thereof to the Audit 
Team within one month from receipt hereof to preclude the withholding of 

salaries pursuant to Section 122 of PD No. 1445 and to ensure the accuracy of 

balance reported; 
 

i. reconcile Accounting and Property records, account the semi-expendables 
properties reported and verify if those were already issued as evidenced by 

RIS and ICS and adjust immediately all discrepancies noted between the 

physical and book inventories within one month from receipt hereof, 

otherwise, for all missing inventories if not produced and accounted, the 

Property Officer shall be liable for their money value and  for all losses, 



vii 

 

occasioned by negligence in the keeping or use of the property,  pursuant to 

Section 105 of PD No. 1445;  
 

j. maintain/prepare the records/forms and other documents as required under 
pertinent provisions of GAM using the format and instructions provided

viii 

 

u. provide the supporting details of the Prior Period Adjustments showing the 
specific accounts affected and present them in the Notes to Financial Statements. 

 

3. Allocation, utilization and disbursements of Special Trust Fund (STF) totaling 
P162,570,545.91 were not in accordance with CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) 

No. 20, series of 2011, and Section 4 (d) of Republic Act (RA) No. 8292, due to: a) 

non-compliance with the prescribed percentage rate of allocation and the limitation 

on adjustment/modification of the specific budget allocation; and b) unallocated 

actual collections and minimal utilization of Fiduciary Funds, thereby adversely 

affecting the effective and efficient delivery of programs, projects and activities 

consistent with the trifocal functions of the EARIST, and the accumulation of 

unutilized cash balances maintained in the authorized government depository banks 

(AGDBs). (Observation No. 3) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. comply with the required percentage of allocation and/or limitations on 
adjustment or modification as prescribed under CMO No. 20, series of 2011 

in the succeeding Academic Years (AYs), and submit appropriate 

justification on the deviations from the approved allotment on specific 

thrusts, programs or activities of the EARIST; 

 

b. make a representation with the CHED on the proposed modification of the 
said CMO pursuant to Section 35 thereof; 

 

c. observe set timelines in the implementation and completion of 
plans/programs and activities to ensure effective delivery of services and to 

address the needs of the students and other stakeholders, as required under 

Section 24 of the CMO; and 

 

d. maximize the utilization of Fiduciary Fees, submit justification on the non-
allocation of actual collections of Fiduciary Fees, and consider assessing 

possible reductions on Fiduciary Fees, where appropriate. 

 

4. From the funds released for Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) program for 
Academic Years (AYs) 2018-2019 and 2019-2020, which were P10,217,600.00 

and P1,751,000.00, respectively, only P7,480,800.00 or 73.21 percent and 

P1,180,000.00 or 67.39 percent, respectively, were utilized due to delay in the 

release of funds which prevented the student-grantees from the timely utilization 

thereof, thus defeating the purpose of the TES program. Moreover, the: a) non-

maintenance of separate Bank Account/ Subsidiary Ledger (SL); b) non-submission 

of Mid-year and Annual Reports to UniFAST Board; and c) non-disclosure of 

amounts received related to TES program in the Notes to the FSs are all contrary to 

existing laws, rules, regulation and procedures. (Observation No. 4) 

 

 



ix 

 

We recommended that EARIST Management: 
 

a. maintain a separate bank account and SL for the TES fund for proper 
account management; 

 

b. return any unused fund and submit the liquidation report to CHED; 
 

c. submit mid–year and annual reports as required under Rule 6.2 of the IRR 
of the UniFAST (RA No. 10687); 

 

d. thru the Accountant: 
 

• record the receipts and liquidations of the TES grants in accordance with 
Section 38 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and 

 

• include the amount of funds received for the implementation of the TES 
program in the Notes to FSs; and 

 

e. thru the UniFAST Focal Person: 
 

• closely monitor and strengthen the coordination with the concerned office 
of CHED thru its representative on the release of grants and its related 

documents to facilitate the timely release of fund to student beneficiaries; 

and  
 

• comply with stricter deadline in the submission of requirements to avoid 
delay on stipend release. 

 

5. Procurement contracts entered into by the Institute for CY 2020 totaling 
P37,065,955.83 were not fully compliant with the existing provisions of RA No. 9184 

or the Government Procurement Reform Act, COA issuances and other related 

procurement rules and regulations due to:   a) delayed and non-submission of 

procurement contracts; b) lacking and incomplete supporting documents; and c) non-

compliance with the posting requirements, which precluded the Audit Team from the 

timely review of contracts, cast  doubt on the validity of transactions   and defeated  

the purpose of the law on transparency, competitiveness and accountability. 
(Observation No. 7) 
 

We recommended that Management: 
 

a. for succeeding contracts/agreements, make sure to submit immediately the 
required contracts- original and/or authenticated copies with the necessary 

supporting documents and annexes to COA within five days after their 

execution and issuance to facilitate the technical review thereof in compliance 

with COA Circular No. 2009-001; 
 

b. address accordingly the deficiencies noted above and submit the contracts 
listed in Table 26, and the lacking supporting documents in Table 27 to avoid 



x 

 

issuances of Notices of Suspension and/or Disallowance on related 

disbursements; and 
 

c. observe and comply with the posting requirements provided under the IRR 
of RA No. 9184 to ensure transparency, competitiveness and accountability 

to all procurement. 

 

6. The regularity, validity, completeness and legality of the transactions with an 
aggregate amount of P60,320,738.99 in CY  2020 cannot be ascertained due to non-

submission of DVs and other necessary/required documents, contrary to Sections 4 

and 122 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and pertinent provisions of the GAM 

for NGAs, Volume I. (Observation No. 9) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. observe strictly the proper documentation of all transactions pursuant to 
Sections 4 and 122 of PD No. 1445 and pertinent provisions of the GAM for 

NGAs, Volume 1; and  

 

b. submit the necessary DVs with complete supporting documents to determine 
the regularity, validity, completeness and legality of the transactions; 

otherwise, a corresponding Notice of Suspension shall be issued covering the 

subject’s transactions for any unaccounted /unsubmitted documents. 

 

The aforementioned audit observations and recommendations were discussed with 

Agency Officials in an Exit Conference, via Google Meet, conducted on March 25, 2021 

and their comments were considered in this Report, where appropriate.
