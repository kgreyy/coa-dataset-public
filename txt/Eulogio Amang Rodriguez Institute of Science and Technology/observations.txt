PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

Misstatements of Financial Statements (FSs) 

 

1. Various accounts under the Assets, Liabilities and Equity categories have 
misstatements totaling P28,647,430.80, representing 2.65 percent of its total 

Assets of P1,082,389,622.75 as at December 31, 2020. Due to the significant 

impact of said misstatements on the reported balances of the affected accounts, 

the accuracy, completeness and existence of the said accounts could not be 

relied upon. 

 

1.1. Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 
and Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 

National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I state that “The FSs shall 

present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of 

an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects 

of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the 

definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and 

expenses set out in PPSAS1.” 

 

1.2. Moreover, Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 require 
agencies to keep the accounts in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of 

the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed 

by fiscal or control agencies of the government; and that the highest standard 

of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of 

accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. Each 

government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations 

conformably with IPSAS and in accordance with pertinent laws and 

regulations. 

 

1.3. Our audit of the Eulogio “Amang” Rodriguez Institute of Science and 
Technology’s (EARIST’s) FSs disclosed misstatements in several accounts 

totaling P28,647,430.80, as shown below:

Excess of misstatements over materiality threshold  25,234,355.76 

 

1.4. The concept of materiality is applied in evaluating the effect of identified 
misstatement or omission in the FSs. The overall materiality threshold of 

P3,413,075.04 was set to one per cent of the total expenses of 

P341,307,503.93 per Statement of Financial Performance for the year ended 

December 31, 2020. 

 

1.5. In summary, total misstatements affecting asset, equity and expense accounts 
which were not adjusted in the books of EARIST during the audit period 

amounted to P28,647,430.80. This amount exceeded the established 

materiality threshold of P3,413,075.04 or one percent of the Total Expenses 

balance for an expense-driven entity. Due to the significant impact of such 

errors and omissions on the accuracy, existence, classification and 

completeness assertions in the reported balances of affected accounts, the 

Audit Team rendered a qualified opinion on the FSs of the EARIST. 



40 

 

1.6. The detailed discussion of misstatements and corresponding recommendations 
are shown on the below: 

 

a.) Unsupported adjustments of Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Savings 
Account understating both the Cash in Bank and Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) Accounts by P3,665,447.13 

 

1.7. Audit of Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Savings Account revealed that 
adjustments amounting to P3,665,447.13, which was the difference between 

the book and bank records was credited to the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, 

Savings Account, without proper documentation to reconcile the balances 

between the two records. In the previous year’s audit observation, the Audit 

Team identified the amount as accumulated errors caused by years of non-

preparation of Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS), in which the Audit 

Team recommended to the Management to prepare and submit all the BRSs 

for CYs 2017, 2018 and 2019, together with the necessary supporting 

documents, and identify the errors so they can draw the necessary adjusting 

entries. 

 

1.8. We recognize the intention of the Management to reconcile their records, but 
such action must be fully supported and documented. Aside from the BRS, 

necessary reports and Bank Statements were not also submitted to the Audit 

Team, thus we also have no basis to check the accuracy and validity of the 

transactions and the adjusting entries made. 

 

b.) Non-recording of previous year’s settlements of disallowances totaling 
P713,000.00 overstated the Other Receivable-Disallowances and 
Charges account and understated the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) 

account by the same amount of  P713,000.00 
 

1.9. Monitoring of the settlement of disallowances/charges showed that settlements 
made in prior years totaling P713,000.00 were not taken up in the books or 

deducted from their corresponding NDs, thereby understating the 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account and overstating the Other Receivables-

Disallowance and Charges account by the same amount. Details of unrecorded 

settlements are shown in the following table:

Total Unrecorded Settlement Amount 713,000.00 

 

c.) Errors in recording of leased assets understated the Leased Assets, 
Accumulated Depreciation and Lease Payable accounts by 

P22,500,000.00, P21,375,000.00 and P15,050,000.00, respectively, and 
overstated Prepaid Rent and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts 

by P7,450,000.00 and P21,375,000.00, respectively. 
 

1.10. Records of EARIST showed that no assets and liabilities were recognized on 
the 3-year Lease Contract for the project “Rent to Own I.T. Equipment 

amounting to P22,500,000.00 entered into by EARIST. Audit showed that 

entries were only made upon payments, however, payments made amounting 

to P7,450,000.00 were recognized in the books as Prepaid Rent. These errors 

and misclassification understated the Leased Assets and Lease Payable 

accounts by P22,500,000.00 and P15,050,000.00, respectively, while 

overstated the reported Prepaid Rent account by P7,450,000.00.  Moreover, 

the leased assets were not provided depreciation, understating and overstating 

the Accumulated Depreciation and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts by 

P21,375,000.00. Details are as follows:

d.) Recording of prepayments as outright expenses upon payment 
understated the Prepayments account and overstated the Subscription 

Expenses account, both by P1,321,240.67 
 

1.11. Section 6, Chapter 1 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides, among 
others, that each entity shall recognize and present its financial transactions 

and operations conformably to the accrual basis of accounting in accordance 

with the IPSAS. 

 

1.12. Accrual basis of accounting means a basis of accounting under which 
transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only 

when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions 

and events are recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the 

financial statements of the periods to which they relate. The elements 

recognized under accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, 

revenue, and expenses. 

 

1.13. Records show that for CY 2020, EARIST paid subscriptions and other 
deferred items totaling P1,766,632.00 which was recorded as outright expense 

at the time of payments. Of that amount, P445,391.34 was for used/consumed 

subscriptions during the year, leaving an unexpired amount of P1,321,240.67.  

No entries were drawn to adjust or recognize the unexpired portion as Prepaid 

Assets, thus understated and overstated the Prepayments and Subscription 

Expenses accounts, respectively, both by P1,321,240.67. Details are as 

follows:

e.) Errors in recording of unclaimed checks understated the Accounts 
Payable, Semi-expendables and Expenses accounts by P447,743.00, 
P168,582.50 and P279,160.50, respectively 

 

1.14. Section 56, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that: 
 

Adjustments for Unreleased Commercial Checks.  A Schedule of 

Unreleased Commercial Checks shall be prepared by the Cashier for 

submission to the Accounting Division/Unit.  All unreleased checks at 

the end of the year shall be reverted back to the Cash accounts.  A JEV 

shall be prepared to recognize the restoration of the cash equivalent to 

the unreleased checks and the recognition of the appropriate 

liability/payable account.   The accounting entry for the restoration of 

the unreleased check to the Cash account shall be a debit to “Cash in 

Bank-Local Currency, Current Account” with credit to the appropriate 

liability account. There shall be no physical cancellation of the checks.  

The JEV supporting such restoration shall form part of the supporting 

document to the financial statements to be submitted to COA at yearend.  

At the start of the ensuing year, another JEV shall be drawn to reverse 

the previous entry made and recognize the availability of the checks for 

release.  Xxx. 

 

1.15. Restoration of the unclaimed check for the year ended December 31, 2020 
under Fund 164 was recognized as credit to Expenses/Asset accounts instead 

of Accounts Payable, thus understated the Accounts Payable, Semi-

Expendables and Expenses accounts by P447,743.00, P168,582.50 and 

P279,160.50, respectively, details are shown on the next page:

1.16. We recommended that   Management/Accountant prepare the necessary 
adjusting journal entries to correct and adjust the above misstatements to 

reflect the accurate balances of the affected accounts. 
 

1.17. The Management commented that some adjustments will be reflected in the 
first quarter FSs of CY 2021.  For other misstatements, they are still in the 

process of reconciling their records and will submit the corresponding 

adjusting entries once done. 
 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 
 

1.18. The Management should provide the Audit Team with the JEV, as evidence of 
adjustments made in its first quarter FSs,  with corresponding supporting 

documents. A clear plan of action on how to reconcile their records and a 

specific timeline should also be submitted to the Audit Team for monitoring 

purposes. 

 

Accounting and Property Control Deficiencies 
 

2. The aggregate balance of P1,250,457,612.16 of accounts Due from NGAs, 
Receivables, Inventories, Advances, Property, Plant and Equipment and 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable and of 

doubtful validity due to accounting and property control deficiencies.  
 

2.1 Section 4, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, on Financial 
Reporting, provides that the "Responsibility for the fair presentation and 

reliability of financial statements rests with the management of the reporting 

agency, particularly the head of finance/accounting office and the head of 

entity or his authorized representative.” 
 

2.2 Reliability means that reliable information is free from material error and bias, 
and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports 

to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent; while, Faithful 

representation means that for information to represent faithfully transactions 

and other events, it should be presented in accordance with the substance of 



45 

 

the transactions and other events, and not merely their legal form. (Section 6, 

Chapter 19, GAM for NGAs, Volume I) 

 

2.3 Further, Section 122, PD No. 1445 also provides that: 
 

Submission of reports. 1. Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies 

of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it 

require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, 

disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, and other 

responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, 

physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such 

other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions.

2.4 Audit of the various Assets accounts of the Institute disclosed the following

Details of Accounting and Property Control Deficiencies: 

 

DUE FROM NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES 

 

a.)   Absence of periodic reconciliation of records between the agency and   
DBM-PS 

 

2.5 Sections 6 and 7 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 
prescribe the rules and regulations on the monitoring and liquidation of fund 

transfers, to wit: 

 

Section 6.0 - General Guidelines  

 

6.1 All government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and 
analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected 

when these become due and demandable and that cash advances and 

fund transfers are liquidated within the prescribed period depending 

upon their nature and purpose; 

 

Section 7.0 - Specific Guidelines  

 

7.1 Conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis, and validation 
of the existence of the receivables, unliquidated cash advances, and 

fund transfers, and determine the concerned debtors, accountable 

officers (Regular and Special Disbursing Officers, Collecting 

Officers, Cashiers) and the source and implementing government 

entities concerned; 

 

7.2 Reconcile the unliquidated fund transfers between the source and 
implementing government entities, prepare the adjusting entries for 

the reconciling items noted, and require liquidation of the balances; 

 

7.3 Prepare aging of dormant receivables, unliquidated cash advances, 
and fund transfers on a quarterly basis to support the request for 

write-off, and indicate in the Remarks column the existence of the 

applicable conditions, such as “absence of records or documents to 

validate/support the claim and/or unreconciled reciprocal accounts. 

 

2.6 Confirmation made with the DBM-PS disclosed that the EARIST has a 
balance of ₱671,734.05 as of December 31, 2020 as against the EARIST’s 

book balance of P2,961,364.01, thus resulting in a discrepancy of 

₱2,289,629.96. 

 

2.7 It was noted that the existence of discrepancy and accumulation of errors were 
due to the absence of any action from the Management to reconcile their 

records with the DBM Party Ledger card.  
 



48 

 

2.8 Analysis of fund transfers to DBM-PS and the result of the confirmation for 
CYs 2015-2020 showed that throughout the years, EARIST and DBM-PS had 

not reconciled the significant difference between their records,  with 

discrepancy ranging from 35.56 to 77.32 percent, to wit: 

 

Table 7. Comparison of EARIST and DBM-PS Records 

Year 
EARIST DBM-PS Difference Percentage of 

Difference (in Pesos) 

2015     6,109,649.10       3,057,422.42     3,052,226.68  49.96 

2016     5,633,742.45       3,630,179.65     2,003,562.80  35.56

b.) Deficiencies noted in the previous years’ audit were not yet corrected  
 

2.9 The unaccounted and unreconciled balance of the account Due from DBM-PS 
had been brought to Management’s attention in the previous Annual Audit 

Reports, with proposed reconciliation based on the errors found in audit for 

transactions covering period CYs 2015-2017. 

 

2.10 It was recommended to Management to review and verify those errors noted, 
and draw adjustments to reflect the correct balance of Due from DBM-PS 

account, but the same were not acted upon by the Management. 

 

c.) Credited P6,430,659.88 to Due from NGAs account without proper 
documentation and reconciliation  

 

2.11 Meanwhile, review of the account showed that a credit of P6,430,659.88 to 
Due from NGAs account was made without proper documentation and 

reconciliation. Inquiry with the Management revealed that the intention is to 

reconcile the balances between the Accounting and DBM-PS records based on 

the records provided by the DBM-PS. 

 

2.12 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. reconcile Accounting records of EARIST with the DBM-PS Party 
Ledger Card to ascertain the causes of the discrepancies and  

communicate the same to the Accountant of the DBM-PS  for proper 

adjustments of  the two records in order to reflect the  correct balance 

of the advances of EARIST; and 

 

b. provide all necessary supporting documents to the adjustments made 
to Due from NGAs account amounting to P6,430,659.88, otherwise, 

reverse previous entry made. 



49 

 

2.13 The Management commented that the current transactions were reconciled 
with DBM-PS and they will exert all efforts to reconcile the discrepancies 

pertaining to prior years’ transactions based on the available records they can 

locate. However, due to the limited manpower and the Pandemic, they cannot 

provide a timeline on when to complete the reconciliation. 
 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 
 

2.14 The Audit Team acknowledged the above-cited limitations and Management’s 
intention to reconcile the discrepancies, however, such adjustments must be 

carefully verified and corroborated with complete supporting documents to 

fully identify the nature of discrepancies before adjustments are recorded.  

 

OTHER RECEIVABLES ACCOUNT 
 

d.) Absence of subsidiary records for Accounts Receivable 
 

2.15 Section 4, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, on Financial 
Reporting, provides that the "Responsibility for the fair presentation and 

reliability of financial statements rests with the management of the reporting 

agency, particularly the head of finance/accounting office and the head of 

entity or his authorized representative." 
 

2.16 Review of the Institute’s Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 
2020 showed that the Institute’s Other Receivables account has an outstanding 

balance of P621,850.16 and P16,303,126.21 for its Fund 101 and Fund 161, 

respectively, or a total balance of P16,924,976.37. Per Notes to FS, the 

account has a zero balance, in view of the provision of allowance for 

impairment in the same amounts for Funds 101 and 161.  

 

2.17 The Audit Team requested Management to submit subsidiary records or other 
supporting documents/schedules pertaining to the accounts, but, instead, a 

certification was issued stating that they cannot establish the details of the 

account as it pertains to transactions that occurred more than 10 years ago and 

that the source documents are no longer available.  

 

2.18 With that, confirmation on the existence of the said account is unfeasible due 
to the absence of subsidiary records and necessary supporting documents 

showing the nature and names of the persons whom these receivables are to be 

received/collected. The Audit Team, therefore, has no basis to ascertain the 

accuracy of the amount reported in the financial statement. 
 

e.) Lack of Request to Write-off Dormant Accounts Receivable 
 

2.19 Based on the previous year’s audit report, it was recommended to the 
Management to consider filing a request for write-off to derecognize these 

accounts following the provisions in COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated 

December 19, 2016. As of this writing, one request for write-off was returned 



50 

 

by the Audit Team to the Management for submission of additional required 

documents. 

 

f.) Absence of Clear-Cut Guidelines on Recognition and Computation of 
the Allowance for Impairment Loss 

 

2.20 Since collection and recovery is difficult, if not impossible given the 
circumstances, it was also recommended to the Management to issue a 

guideline on the recognition of Allowance for Impairment so that allowance 

for Impairment to these receivables be provided as required under Section 10, 

Chapter 7 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

2.21 Financial reports submitted showed that Management recognized Allowance 
for Impairment amounting to P16,924,976.37 or 100 percent of the receivables 

reported, however, no clear-cut guidelines/policy were issued in setting the 

procedures and manners on how these Allowance for Impairment be computed 

and recognized. These guidelines will be the basis of the Audit Team to 

evaluate if the Impairment provided is accurate and reasonable under given 

circumstances. 

 

2.22 Due to the above deficiencies, the Other Receivables account is doubtful and 
unreliable. 

 

2.23 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. exert extra effort to provide subsidiary records and retrieve the 
supporting documents pertaining to the accounts in order to establish 

and identify the names of the accountable persons and/or entity from 

whom those receivables are to be collected; 

 

b. evaluate dormant accounts and comply with all the conditions and 
requirements of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 

for the request for write off; and 

 

c. issue guidelines/policy on the recognition of Allowance for 
Impairment and review if the recognition previously made is aligned 

with the policy, otherwise, reverse the entries made and recognize 

Allowance for Impairment based on the set guidelines. 

 

2.24 Management commented that they have issued a Memorandum on the 
Guidelines on the Recognition of Allowance for Impairment in March 2021. 

They are appealing for consideration on establishing and identifying the 

names of the accountable persons and/or entities from whom the receivables 

are to be collected since they can no longer locate the documents as those 

accounts have been in their books since 1980 and retrieval of documents is no 

longer possible. 



51 

 

INVENTORIES ACCOUNT 

 

g.) Deliveries of supplies and materials were recorded as outright expense 
 

2.25 As of December 31, 2020, Inventories account showed an outstanding balance 
of P24,762,810.55. Review of Inventories account General Ledger (GL) and 

other supporting documents showed that deliveries of supplies and materials 

were not recorded as Inventories/Assets but, instead, recorded as outright 

expenses, which is inconsistent with Section 6. b, Chapter 1 of the GAM for 

NGAs, Volume I as regards accrual basis of accounting as one of the basic 

Government Accounting and Budget Reporting Principles. Also, most of 

Inventories sub-accounts were non-moving, same as reported last year. 

 

2.26 Confirmation with the concerned personnel revealed that there were supplies 
and materials left as at yearend in the stockroom but no entries were made to 

adjust the account balance and recognize them, thus overstated the Supplies 

and Materials Expenses account and understated the Inventories Account by 

the value of the Inventories left in the stockroom. Report on the Physical 

Count of Inventories (RPCI) was not submitted to the Audit Team so we have 

no basis to determine the amount of misstatements. 

 

h.) Existence of Semi-Expendable Properties totaling P14,848,321.05 
cannot be ascertained 

 

2.27 For CY 2020, EARIST reported Semi-Expendable Properties totaling 
P14,848,321.05. Ocular inspection revealed that these reported semi-

expendables were not present and not available in the stockroom. 

Confirmation and verification with the concerned personnel showed that they 

do not have these semi-expendables reported as they do not stock those items. 

They only purchase semi-expendable items upon request and issued them to 

the requesting office upon receipt as they have limited space in the stockroom. 

It is possible that those items were already issued to the end-users but were not 

credited in the Inventories account and recognized as Expense upon issuance. 

 

2.28 Due to the absence of the Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) and other supporting 
documents, the Audit Team cannot establish the amount of misstatements and 

fully verify the accuracy and reliability of the reported amount. 

 

i.) Non-moving balance of Inventory sub-accounts carried in the books for 
several years amounting to P10,036,684.50 

 

2.29 Review of the accounts showed that various sub-accounts totaling 
P10,036,684.50 were non-moving and have been dormant from two to more 

than 10 years. This was incorporated in the previous year’s findings and the 

Management is amenable that the amounts reported in the books no longer 

existed or were already issued/consumed but were not derecognized in the 



52 

 

book due to absence of regular reconciliation between the Accounting and 

Property records. The amount is only being carried forward every year without 

verification. 
 

 

j.) Non-maintenance/preparation of records/forms and other reports as 
required under pertinent provisions of GAM 

 

2.30 Section 17, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM enumerated the Records, Forms 
and Reports to be prepared and/or maintained.  

 

2.31 Review of the reports submitted showed that Supplies Ledger Cards (SLC) 
and Stock Cards (SC) were not maintained for each type of supplies to record 

all receipts and issuances. The Accounting Unit and the Supply and/or 

Property Unit did not conduct periodic reconciliation of the SLC and SC to 

identify and adjust any discrepancy. 

 

2.32 No RPCI was also submitted as there was no physical count conducted for 
several years already. The Management did not conduct a physical count of 

inventories to determine the existence of the recorded inventories and submit 

the result thereof in the RPCI pursuant to Section 13, Chapter 8 of GAM for 

NGAs, Volume I which provides that “Physical count/inventory, which is 

required semi-annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the 

integrity of property custodianship.” 

 

2.33 Other reports were submitted but were not properly filled up/signed as 
instructed under GAM for NGAs, Volume II. 

 

2.34 Due to the abovementioned observations, errors and misstatements, the 
existence and accuracy of the balance of Inventories accounts totaling 

P24,762,810.55 cannot be relied upon. 

 

2.35 We recommended that Management thru the: 
 

Accountant- 

 

a. recognize and record in the books the Inventories upon purchase 
or delivery thereof and record expenses upon distribution in 

compliance with the accrual method of accounting to prevent 

over/understatement of accounts; 

 

b. review the non-moving balance of Inventory sub-accounts carried 
in the books for several years and check for possible 

derecognition/write-down within one month from receipt hereof; 

 

 

 

 



53 

 

Property Officer- 
 

c. conduct physical count of inventories and submit RPCI thereof to 
the Audit Team within one month from receipt hereof to preclude 

the withholding of salaries pursuant to Section 122 of PD No. 1445 

and to ensure the accuracy of balance reported; 
 

Accountant and Property Officer- 
 

d. reconcile Accounting and Property records, account the semi-
expendables properties reported and verify if those were already 

issued as evidenced by RIS and ICS and adjust immediately all 

discrepancies noted between the physical and book inventories 

within one month from receipt hereof, otherwise, for all missing 

inventories if not produced and accounted, the Property Officer 

shall be liable for their money value and  for all losses, occasioned 

by negligence in the keeping or use of the property,  pursuant to 

Section 105 of PD No. 1445; and 
 

e. maintain/prepare the records/forms and other documents as 
required under pertinent provisions of GAM using the format and 

instructions provided under GAM for NGAs, Volume II, within 

one month from receipt hereof, to preclude the withholding of 

salaries pursuant to Section 122 of PD No. 1445. 
 

2.36 The Management commented that the PMS Chief is in close coordination with 
the FMS Heads as far as valuation for inventories are concerned.  RSMI and 

other reports using GAM format were also prepared and submitted. Now, 

PMS is conducting physical inventory of the materials and supplies at the 

stockroom and, at the same time, noting those items which were either slow- 

moving or non-moving/dormant at all.  Items which have outgrown their 

useful life were also noted as those will be a part of their reconciliation with 

FMS.  Report will be prepared and submitted to the Audit Team as soon as 

finalized. 

 

2.37 FMS, on the other hand, in coordination with the Property Office, will review 
the semi-expendable properties and non-moving inventories and check if 

possible derecognition/ write-down is possible and provide adjustment as 

necessary, once reconciliation has been made. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

2.38 The Audit Team recognized the efforts made by the concerned offices and 
their compliance with the required submission of reports, however, inquiry 

revealed that SCs and SLCs are still not maintained. Though the PMS is 

compliant with the submission of RSMI, these were not used by the FMS in 

recording their Supplies and Materials Expenses.

ADVANCES 

 

k.) Accumulation of unsettled/unliquidated cash advance balance at year-
end - P8,128,055.28 

 

2.39 COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides the rules and 
regulations regarding the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash 

advances. 

 

2.40 The legal presumption against non-liquidation of cash advances is provided by 
Articles 217 and 218 of the Revised Penal Code as quoted hereunder: 

 

The failure of a public officer to have duly forthcoming any public funds 

or property with which he is chargeable, upon demand by any duly 

authorized officer, shall be prima facie evidence that he has put such 

missing funds or property to personal use. 

 

Any public officer, whether in the service or separated therefrom by 

resignation or any other cause, who is required by law or regulation to 

render account to the Insular Auditor, or to a provincial auditor and 

who fails to do so for a period of two months after such accounts should 

be rendered, shall be punished by prison correctional in its minimum 

period, or by a fine ranging from 200 to 6,000 pesos, or both. (Emphasis 

supplied) 

 

2.41 The above-cited rules and regulations were formulated to provide clear and 
extensive guidelines for an effective and efficient control in the granting, 

utilization and liquidation of cash advances. However, these were not strictly 

observed and implemented as can be gleaned from the reports and records 

submitted by the Management.   

 

2.42 The unliquidated Advances for Payroll, Advances to Special Disbursing 
Officer and Advances to Officers and Employees accounts as reflected in the 

FSs of EARIST as of December 31, 2020 amounted to P8,128,055.28, broken 

down as follows:

55 

 

2.43 It is the responsibility of the Head of the Agency to ensure the proper granting, 
and utilization of all cash advances in accordance with the set rules and 

regulations. To strengthen internal control and adherence to rules and 

regulation in the grant, utilization, and liquidation of cash advances, 

Management shall take appropriate action and exhaust all remedies and/or 

demand for settlement thereof.  

 

2.44 The non-liquidation by the concerned AOs of the unsettled accounts 
overstated the Asset accounts and understated the Expense accounts as well. 

 

l.) Additional Cash Advances Granted to AO Despite Non-liquidation 
 

2.45 The limitation of cash advances is provided under Section 89 of PD No. 1445 
as: 

 

No cash advance shall be given unless for a legally authorized specific 

purpose. A cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon 

as the purpose for which it was given has been served. No additional 

cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the 

previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper 

accounting thereof is made.  

 

2.46 Analysis of account disclosed that various AOs were granted as many as 20 
times even if their previous cash advances have not yet been liquidated, details 

are as follows:

m.) Long Outstanding/Dormant Cash Advances 
 

2.47 COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 prescribes the 
guidelines on the Write-off of Dormant Receivable Accounts, Unliquidated 

Cash Advances and Fund Transfers of National Government Agencies 

(NGAs), Local Government Units, (LGUs) and Government-Owned and/or -

Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) for fair presentation of accounts on the 

FSs. 

 

2.48 Moreover, it provides procedures on the write-off of dormant accounts, the 
required documents to support the same, threshold and approving authority to 

grant the request for write-off, among others. 

 

2.49 Further, Item 10 of COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 05, 1997 
prescribes the guidelines on the proper disposition/closure of dormant 

accounts.  

 

2.50 Review of the Aging Schedule revealed that the bulk of the unliquidated cash 
advances totaling P2,815,323.75 or 35 percent out of the total cash advances 

of P8,128,055.28 had been outstanding for three to more than 10 years, while 

64 percent or P5,210,687.53 was aged less than one year and one percent or 

P102,044.00 was one to two years old, details are summarized as follows:

Percentage 100 64 1 35 

 

2.51 It was noted that the balances of cash advances aged less than one year 
reported in Funds 101 and 151 amounting to P4,955,606.67 and P40,753.00 

respectively, represent payments for Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) 

Incentives of EARIST casual and temporary employees, tax refund and tuition 

fee refund for dropped subjects, while the balance reported in Fund 164 

amounting to P214,327.86 represents payment for Honorarium of part-time 

instructors and BOT members and allowance for student assistants. 

 

2.52 On November 25, 2020, the Audit Team had issued 154 demand letters to 
officers and employees concerned in compliance with COA Memorandum No. 

2017-010 dated May 15, 2017 for purposes of taking appropriate action and/or 

demanding settlement thereof.  

 



57 

 

2.53 For dormant accounts, Management is advised to file the appropriate request 
for authority to write-off dormant accounts. However, as of this writing, only 

one request to write-off dormant accounts of Mr. Cabrera amounting to 

P788,316.42 was filed. However, this was returned to Management for 

submission of additional required supporting documents. 

 

2.54 The absence of regular monitoring of the liquidation/settlement of the cash 
advances granted caused the accumulation of the balances and  casts  doubt on 

the validity and accuracy of the reported balances, thus affecting the fair 

presentation of the accounts in the Institute’s FSs. 

 

2.55 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. strictly comply with COA Circular No 97-002 dated February 10, 
1997 in the granting and utilization of cash advances and refrain from 

granting another cash advance unless previous cash advance/s had 

been settled; 

  

b. impose the appropriate penalties/sanctions against the erring AOs and 
employees with past due accounts; 

 

c. suspend payment of salaries of the Officials and Employees concerned 
for failure on their part to submit the documents and reports 

mentioned herein within one month from receipt hereof or until they 

shall have earlier complied with the requirements of the Commission 

on Audit pursuant to the provision of Section 122 of PD No. 1445; and 

 

d. thru the Accountant, conduct a final review, analysis and 
reconciliation of all dormant cash advances pursuant to the 

Guidelines on the Proper Disposition/Closure/Write-off of Dormant 

funds and/or accounts as provided by COA Circular No.  97-001 dated 

February 5, 1997 and COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 

19, 2016. 

 

2.56 The Management commented that they informed all the accountable persons 
regarding the settlement/liquidation of all cash advances granted to them.  

Those who are no longer connected with EARIST, especially the students,  

were informed through registered mail.  Report on the updated schedule of 

outstanding cash advances will be submitted to the Audit Team once the 

situation under the ECQ improves.  

 

2.57 The Audit Team acknowledged the actions taken by the Management and 
required the Management to prepare and maintain monitoring sheet of actions 

made and furnish a copy to them. If it appears that collection of balances is not 

probable, they have to make a request for write-off. Further, they were advised 

to comply within one month.

2.59 Despite prior years’ observations, the Agency still did not conduct complete 
physical inventory of all its properties as required under Section 38, Chapter 

10 of the GAM for NGAS, Volume I, which provides that “The entity shall 

have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and 

presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and 

Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 71) as at December 31 of each year. This 

shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the 

following year.” This provision was continuously not complied with by the 

Agency.  

 

2.60 Physical inventory-taking is necessary to check the existence and condition of 
the PPE. The reliability of the ledger balance for the PPE accounts can only be 



59 

 

established after the actual inventory-taking and its reconciliation with 

Property and Accounting records. Physical inventory-taking also attests to the 

integrity of property custodianship and accountability.  

 

2.61 Upon inquiry with the Chief of the Property Management Services, the failure 
to conduct a complete inventory-taking is due to the limited manpower under 

their Office. Considering the large volume of backlogs and the demand in the 

reportorial requirements, sufficient number of staff properly equipped with 

experience and competencies must be assigned in the Office. 

 

2.62 The last submitted RPCPPE was for CY 2018, while to date, actual count of 
inventory of PPE is ongoing for the succeeding years. 

 

o.) Non-Recognition of Depreciation Expenses and Accumulated 
Depreciation for PPE 

 

2.63 Review of the submitted FSs for Fund 161 as of December 31, 2020 disclosed 
that no accumulated depreciation and related depreciation expenses were 

computed and recognized on the following PPE accounts: 

 

Table 12. PPE with No Computed Accumulated Depreciation 

PPE Accounts 
Amount 

(in Pesos) 

Office Equipment      1,837,493.89  

Communications Equipment              57,603.00  

Other Equipment            325,627.66  

Furniture and Fixtures            978,372.29  

Total Amount         3,199,096.84  

 

2.64 Section 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I states that: “Except 
for land and not recognized heritage assets, all Property, Plant and 

Equipment shall be depreciated, and that depreciation does not cease when 

the asset becomes idle or is retired from active use and held for disposal 

unless the asset is fully depreciated.” 

 

2.65 The non-recognition of Accumulated Depreciation and Depreciation Expenses 
for the above PPE accounts overstated the Institute’s PPE accounts disclosed 

in the Statement of Financial Position while overstating the financial 

performance for the period ended December 31, 2020, thereby the fair 

presentation of the FSs was not achieved. 

 

p.) No Accounting and Property Records Maintained for PPE 
 

2.66 Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs provides that: “The Chief 
Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE including 

work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record 



60 

 

promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, 

depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. 

For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise 

maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and 

disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC 

maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled 

with other property records like PAR.” Moreover, it enumerates the 

Accounting and Property records to be maintained to account for PPE. 

 

2.67 As of this writing, Management did not regularly maintain Accounting and 
Property records to account for PPE, i.e., PPELCs and PCs. Management 

informed that they are planning to create a committee intended for the one-

time cleansing of PPE accounts, however, due to the limited number of 

personnel in the PMS and FMS, they are still looking for the personnel who 

will compose the committee. 

 

2.68 All the circumstances discussed above affected the accuracy and reliability of 
the reported PPE balances and the fair presentation of the accounts in the FSs.  

 

2.69 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. assign PMS with sufficient number of staff properly equipped with 
experience and competencies to comply with the reportorial 

requirements; 

 

b. thru the Accountant, record the Accumulated Depreciation and 
Depreciation expenses for the above PPE accounts and submit the 

JEV to the Audit Team; 

 

c. comply with the pertinent provisions of GAM for NGAs on 
recognition and reporting of PPE accounts; and 

 

d. revisit COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 for the 
guidelines and procedures for the conduct of physical count of PPE, 

recognition of PPE items found at station, and disposition for non-

existing/missing PPE items to aid the one-time cleansing of PPE 

account balances. 

 

2.70 Management commented that PPE additions for CYs 2019 and 2020 were 
properly documented but due to absence of turnover from prior administration, 

prior years’ depreciation expenses were computed based on the total amounts 

only, as presented in prior years’ FSs, since they could not locate the itemized 

listing of the balances. They acknowledged that further adjustment is needed 

to have a reliable PPE amount to be presented in the FSs. 

 

 



61 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 
 

2.71 The Audit Team recognized that the deficiencies noted were due to the lapses 
in the prior year’ Property Management System and limited manpower, 

however, the Management was encouraged to exert extra efforts to work back 

and establish PPELCs and PCs, and reconcile both records to come up with an 

accurate balance. Management must also address the issue on lack of 

manpower by filling the vacant positions and assigning PMS and FMS with 

qualified and sufficient number of staff. 

 

ACCUMULATED SURPLUS/(DEFICIT) 
 

q.) non-restatement of Prior Year’s FSs and Unsupported Prior Period 
Adjustments totaling P79,406,536.60  

 

2.72 Section 7, Chapter 19, of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I states that the 
“Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial 

performance and cash flows of an entity.  Fair presentation requires the 

faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and 

conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for 

assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out in PPSAS2.  The application of 

PPSASs3, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in 

financial statements that achieve a fair presentation (Par. 27, PPSAS 1).  
 

2.73 Paragraph 58 of the IPSAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements has 
referred to IPSAS 3 which deals with the adjustments to comparative 

information required when an entity changes an accounting policy or corrects 

an error. 
 

2.74 The IPSAS 3 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors provides the presentation and disclosure of Prior Period Errors, in 

reference to Sections 42, 44, and 45, Chapter 19  of the GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I, as follows: 
 

a) Section 42 (b). An entity shall correct material prior period errors 
retrospectively in the first set of financial statements authorized for 

issue after their discovery by: (1) restating the comparative amounts 

for prior period(s) presented in which the error occurred; or (2) if the 

error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating the 

opening balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for the 

earliest prior period presented; 
 

b) Section 44. An entity shall disclose the following: (a) the nature of 
the prior period error; (b) for each prior period presented, to the 

extent practicable, the amount of the correction for each financial 

 
2 See Note 1 
3 See Note 1 



62 

 

statement line item affected; (c) the amount of the correction at the 

beginning of the earliest prior period presented; and (d) if 

retrospective restatement is impracticable for a particular prior period, 

the circumstances that led to the existence of that condition and a 

description of how and from when the error has been corrected; and 
 

c) Section 45 illustrates the sample retrospective restatement of errors. 
 

2.75 As defined in the GAM for NGAs, Volume I and paragraph 46 of IPSAS 3, 
errors are those  arising in respect of the recognition, measurement, 

presentation, or disclosure of elements of financial statements.  Financial 

statements are deemed not compliant with IPSASs if they contain either 

material errors, or immaterial errors made intentionally to achieve a particular 

presentation of an entity’s financial position, financial performance, or cash 

flows.  Thus, potential current period errors discovered in that period are 

corrected before the financial statements are authorized for issue.  Material 

errors are sometimes not discovered until a subsequent period, and these prior 

period errors are corrected in the comparative information presented in the 

financial statements for that subsequent period. 
 

2.76 Paragraph 47 of the IPSAS 3 provides further that subject to the limitations of 
retrospective adjustment, an entity shall correct material prior period errors 

retrospectively in the first set of financial statements authorized for issue after 

their discovery by: 
 

a) Restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in which 
the error occurred; or 
 

b) If the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating the 
opening balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for the earliest 

prior period presented. 
 

2.77 Review of the Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity for the Year Ended 
December 31, 2020 submitted by the Management showed that the Prior 

Period Adjustments were presented with the total amount of ₱79,406,536.60.  

These were also disclosed in the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements, 

of which Management identified them as transactions for previous years such 

as salaries, correction of amounts, liquidation of cash advances, recording of 

disallowances, recording of donations, depreciation of various assets which 

were only taken up during the year. Details of PPAs as disclosed in the Notes 

to FSs were as follows:

2.78 The above material prior period errors were not properly supported by 
documents and not corrected retrospectively as required under the pertinent 

provisions of GAM for NGAs (NGAs), Volume I and the IPSAS. Records 

showed that it was recorded as direct adjustments to the Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) Account, thus increasing the account by ₱79,406,536.60. 

 

2.79 Inquiry with the Management disclosed that they failed to restate their FSs as 
it would take time for them to collate all the necessary supporting documents 

from their former office which was recently renovated and due to current 

working situation brought about by the Pandemic. 

 

2.80 Non-restatement of the material Prior Period Adjustments in the CY 2019 Financial 
Statements amounting to ₱79,406,536.60 due to the absence of supporting 

documents, adversely affected the fair presentation of the comparative FSs 

contrary to the provisions of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I and the IPSAS. 

 

2.81 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. comply with the retrospective application of the Prior Period Adjustments 
by restating the 2019 Financial Statements as stated in the IPSAS 1 and 3 

in reference to Sections 42, 44 and 46, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAS, 

Volume I; 

 

b. use the prescribed format provided in Section 45, Chapter 19 of the GAM 
for NGAs, Volume I for proper procedures and disclosures of 

Retrospective Restatement of Errors; and 

 

c. provide the supporting details of the Prior Period Adjustments showing 
the specific accounts affected and present them in the Notes to Financial 

Statements. 

 

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 

Special Trust Fund (STF) Allocation, Utilization and Disbursements 

 

3. Allocation, utilization and disbursements of Special Trust Fund (STF) totaling 
P162,570,545.91 were not in accordance with CHED Memorandum Order 

(CMO) No. 20, series of 2011, and Section 4 (d) of Republic Act (RA) No. 8292, 

due to: a) non-compliance with the prescribed percentage rate of allocation and 

the limitation on adjustment/modification of the specific budget allocation; and 

b) unallocated actual collections and minimal utilization of Fiduciary Funds, 

thereby adversely affecting the effective and efficient delivery of programs, 

projects and activities consistent with the trifocal functions of the EARIST, and 

the accumulation of unutilized cash balances maintained in the authorized 

government depository banks (AGDBs). 

 



65 

 

3.1 Section 4 (d) of RA No. 8292 or the Higher Education Modernization Act of 
1997  provides in part that any income generated by the university or college 

from tuition fees and other charges, as well as from the operation of auxiliary 

services and land grants, shall be retained by the university or college, and 

may be disbursed by the Board of Regents/Trustees (BOR/T) for instruction, 

research, extension, or other programs/projects of the university or 

college: Provided, that all fiduciary fees shall be disbursed for the specific 

purposes for which they are collected.  

 

3.2 The same Section also stated that if, for reason of control, the university or 
college, shall not be able to pursue any project for which the funds have been 

appropriated and allocated under its approved program of expenditures, the 

Board of Regents/Trustees (BOR/T) may authorize the use of said funds for 

any reasonable purpose which in its discretion, may be necessary and urgent 

for the attainment of the objectives and goals of the universities or college. 

 

3.3 CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 20, Series of 2011 has been issued to 
establish and institutionalize uniform fiscal policies that will serve as 

guidelines on the use and disposition of all internally generated funds accruing 

to the State University/College (SUC), as well as to integrate a system of 

accountability for all fund administrators. It defines STF as referring to the 

income of the SUC arising from collection of tuition fees, miscellaneous fees, 

service and other income. 

 

3.4 Section 24 thereof states that the budget authorized by the BOR shall be 
implemented within the CY for which it was formulated. The inclusive 

collection period and the Quarter for which the collection will be used shall be 

clearly and specifically stated. The BOR regularly meets only once every 

quarter, and is allowed to conduct special meetings whenever necessary. 

Therefore, a reasonable scheme must be resorted to in order to abide by COA 

Circular No. 2000-002 dated April 4, 2000, which requires board approval for 

the use of income, while aligning the financial operations and transactions 

with the financial cycle which abides by a January to December or the CY 

period. 

 

3.5 Consistent with Section 4(d) of RA No. 8292, the EARIST maintains the 
Special Trust Fund (STF) or Fund 164 with the Land Bank of the Philippines 

(LBP), Malacaňang Branch, to which collections of income are being 

deposited.  

 

3.6 On March 2, 2020, the BOT approved the EARIST’s Proposed Program of 
Expenditures (PRE) for CY 2020 amounting to P105,627,297.92 for Personnel 

Services (PS), Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE), Capital 

Outlays (CO), Fiduciary Fees, extension and research programs/activities. 

However, there were realignments and additions in the budget totaling 

P56,943,247.99, which consisted of collections for the 2nd Semester of 2020, 



66 

 

unprogrammed funds from 2019 collections and prior years’ balances. 

EARIST’s total budget for CY 2020 amounted to P162,570,545.91. 

 

3.7 An evaluation of the submitted approved PRE and the corresponding 
utilization reports disclosed the following deficiencies: 

 

a) Non-compliance with the prescribed percentage rates of allocation and 
the limitation on adjustment/modification of the specific budget 

allocation. 

 

3.8 Sections 6 to 17 of CMO No. 20 set the specific budget allocations and the 
corresponding limitations on the adjustment or modification of percentage 

allocation on the thrusts, programs, and activities, as summarized in the 

succeeding table:

after deduction of the SUC-wide common fund establishment of benchmark 

data to the different thrust, program or activity of the agency on Instruction, 

Research Services, Extension Services, Administrative Services, Production 

and Mandatory Reserves. 

 

3.10 Analysis of the approved specific allocations for the thrusts, programs and 
activities of the EARIST for CY 2020 revealed variances, which were not in 

conformity with the prescribed allocations and specific limitations on 

adjustment or modification of percentage allocation. A comparative table is 

presented in the table below:

3.11 Based on the foregoing table, the non-allocation or decreases in the allocation 
of other thrusts/projects/activities were used to augment allocations for 

Administrative Services, whose allocation comprised of 41.46 percent or 



70 

 

almost half of the allocation, thereby short-changing the other thrust areas of 

the EARIST, especially in Research, Extension, and Production Services, 

which allocations were fixed at 10 percent where no adjustments or 

modifications shall be allowed. Hence, effective delivery of programs and 

projects consistent with the trifocal functions of SUCs, as well as the 

opportunities for additional revenues for the SUC from the supposed 

allocation for Production, are adversely affected. 

 

3.12 Budget for Administrative Services shall be fixed at 10 percent, where 
modification resulting in reduction of the percentage allocation shall not be 

allowed. Though, part of the increase in the allocation for Administrative 

Services can be attributed to the non-provision of SUC-wide Common Fund 

budget as its expenses were lodged in the Administrative Services Allocation, 

the allocation is still way higher and unacceptable. These administrative costs 

should be charged to the General Fund instead of Special Trust Fund.  

 

3.13 Also, amount allocated for Instruction comprising of 47.94 percent of the 
budget did not meet the 50 percent required allocation as provided in the 

above MC. Also, the allocation of this amount to its components were not 

done fairly, resulting in Student Development Budget falling below 7.5 

percent, which is not in compliance with Section 7 of the MC and curtailing 

its development goals and regular operations. 

 

b) Unallocated Actual Collections and Minimal Utilization of Fiduciary 
Funds  

 

3.14 Fees assessed and collected from students intended for specific purpose such 
as cultural fees, medical/dental fees, sports development fees, laboratory fees, 

library fees, guidance fees, and IT fees accrue to the Fiduciary Fees. As 

defined in the CMO, this fund shall be used solely for the purpose for which it 

was authorized to be collected. The listing of what is classified as Fiduciary 

Fund, as well as the college, office, or unit accountable for its utilization shall 

be stated in the Report of Collections, which is submitted to the BOR for 

approval. 

 

3.15 For CY 2020, funds available for Fiduciary Fees totaled P191,806,234.23, 
comprised of accumulated prior years’ unutilized balances and current year’s 

collection. Breakdown is as follows:

been assessed and collected from the students, these Fiduciary Fees should 

have been allocated and disbursed for their intended purpose. 

  

3.17 Of the approved budget totaling P69,734,677.56, only P34,041,948.00 or

3.18 The unutilized balance implies that the Management did not ensure effective 
delivery of services to its students from collected Fiduciary Fees, hence 

further resulting in huge amounts maintained in the AGDB due to the 

accumulation of unutilized balances. This is in contravention of Section 24 of 

CMO 20, series of 2011, which states that the budget authorized by the BOR 

shall be implemented within the CY for which it was formulated. 

 

 

 



72 

 

3.19 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. comply with the required percentage of allocation and/or limitations 
on adjustment or modification as prescribed under CMO No. 20, 

series of 2011 in the succeeding Academic Years (AYs), and submit 

appropriate justification on the deviations from the approved 

allotment on specific thrusts, programs or activities of the EARIST; 
 

b. make a representation with the CHED on the proposed modification 
of the said CMO pursuant to Section 35 thereof; 

 

c. observe set timelines in the implementation and completion of 
plans/programs and activities to ensure effective delivery of services 

and to address the needs of the students and other stakeholders, as 

required under Section 24 of the CMO; and 
 

d. maximize the utilization of Fiduciary Fees, submit justification on the 
non-allocation of actual collections of Fiduciary Fees, and consider 

assessing possible reductions on Fiduciary Fees, where appropriate. 
 

3.20 Management commented that Section 7 of CMO 20, series of 2011 states that 
the percentage allocation for Instruction maybe adjusted in accordance with 

the expenditure trends established in the preceding year and such adjustment 

shall not fall below 7.5 percent for each of the component.   
 

3.21 As for the area on Research Services,  the original allocation was 5.24 percent 
considering that there was an increase in the  allocation provided for under the 

CY 2020 GAA for Conduct of Research including rewards and incentives.  

The Fund Administrator decided to limit this tuition fee share. 
 

3.22 On the Extension Services area,  the absorptive capacity of the sector was 
considered in determining the tuition fee share.  As observed by the 

Management,  the sector, based on its performance in the previous years,  was 

not able to fully utilize the funds alloted for their area.  Management asserted 

that if they will continuously provide the sector with the prescribed percentage 

and if they will not be able to use the allotted budget, other areas may be 

deprived of the much needed funds. 
 

3.23 Further, Management also took cognizance of Section 17 of CMO 20, series 
of 2011, which states that “the suggested percentage allocation maybe 

modified to suit the needs of the SUC provided that such modification was 

approved by the governing board.” 
 

3.24 Management will coordinate with the Philippine Association of State 
Universities and Colleges (PASUC) regarding the proposed modification of 

CMO 20, series of 2011,  considering that said CMO affects not only EARIST 

but all the SUCs. 



73 

 

3.25 Management has reminded the different Fund Administrators on the status of 
their Fiduciary Funds and reminded them that under Section 32 of CMO 20, 

series of 2011,  unexpended balances, regardless of where the funds were  

taken will form part of the common fund of the SUC,  which can be utilized 

for other purposes as long as it is in furtherance of the goals and objectives of 

the Institute. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

3.26 The existing laws give the CHED the power to issue memoranda in the 
implementation and utilization of STF, which the governing boards of the 

SUCs must implement, in the absence of any court declaration invalidating 

such CMO. 

 

3.27 It may be true that the suggested percentage allocation maybe modified to suit 
the needs of the SUC provided that such modification was approved by the 

governing board, but such modification has corresponding limitations that 

must be complied with. Since several SUCs encounter difficulty in   

complying with the STF percentage allocation, it is encouraged to have a 

collective action thru PASUC to initiate amendment of the CMO.  

 

Implementation of Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) Program  

 

4. From the funds released for Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) program for 
Academic Years (AYs) 2018-2019 and 2019-2020, which were P10,217,600.00 

and P1,751,000.00, respectively, only P7,480,800.00 or 73.21 percent and 

P1,180,000.00 or 67.39 percent, respectively, were utilized due to delay in 

the release of funds which prevented the student-grantees from the timely 

utilization thereof, thus defeating the purpose of the TES program. Moreover, 

the: a) non-maintenance of separate Bank Account/ Subsidiary Ledger (SL); b) 

non-submission of Mid-year and Annual Reports to UniFAST Board; and c) 

non-disclosure of amounts received related to TES program in the Notes to the 

FSs are all contrary to existing laws, rules, regulation and procedures. 

 

4.1 The TES was established under RA No. 10931, also known as the Universal 
Access to Quality Tertiary Education of 2017, to support the cost of tertiary 

education or any part or portion thereof of poor but deserving Filipino students 

who are enrolled in the 112 state universities and colleges (SUCs) and 78 local 

universities and colleges (LUCs) in the Philippines and whose names appear 

in the Listahanan 2.0 or the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) list of 

the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).  

 

4.2 The TES targets not necessarily those who are poor, but also those who have 
no access to public university system. This grants-in-aid program is intended 

to support the costs of college education, particularly use for books and other 



74 

 

education-related expenses such as transportation, supplies, room, lodging and 

board fees. 

 

4.3 Memorandum Circular No. 2018-004 dated October 15, 2018 was issued by 
the Unified Student Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Education 

(UniFAST) Governing Board as the implementing guidelines for the TES for 

Filipino students. 
 

Academic Year (AY) 2018-2019 
 

4.4 EARIST received funding from the CHED-UNIFAST amounting to 
P10,217,600.00 for the implementation of the TES program for the Academic 

Years 2018-2019. The said budget included the payment of TES allowances to 

qualified student beneficiaries providing them with a monthly stipend of 

P3,500.00 and a book allowance of ₱2,500.00 every semester, or a total of 

₱20,000.00 per semester or ₱40,000.00 annually and three percent (3%) 

administrative costs, details as follows:

4.5 Based in our audit of payrolls, schedules and disbursement vouchers (DVs), 
the utilization of TES Grants from CHED-UNIFAST were as follows: 

 

a. On December 18, 2019, EARIST received P2,842,800.00 from CHED, 
which was intended for the payment of TES beneficiaries for AY 2018-

2019. However, in their fund Utilization Report as of December 9, 2020, it 

turned out that only P720,000.00 (P360,000.00/semester) or 18 grantees 

were qualified for the said subsidy. The said utilized amount was very 

minimal compared to the amount released by CHED, details are as

b. Inquiry with the EARIST’s Budget Officer revealed that he was notified 
about the amount granted, however, he was not provided with the list of 

grantees which served as a basis for the amount transferred. Out of the 

unexpended amount, P2,101,200.00 was refunded to CHED on February 

07, 2020 under OR#5735529 per Check No. 378431 dated February 05, 

2020. The remaining P800.00 is due for refund as requested by Office of 

the Student Affairs (OSA) to date. 

 

c. For AY 2018-2019, EARIST had granted a total amount of P6,756,800.00 
for its 164 continuing ESGP-PA scholars. The amount of subsidy was 

based on the guidelines set forth by the UniFAST Board and on the annual 

budgetary appropriation for this purpose. However, out of the said amount, 

only P6,300,000.00 was distributed. 

 

d. Records showed that the student beneficiaries who were not included in 
the payroll had to be dropped from the list because they had already 

stopped, graduated or were currently receiving other scholarship 

allowances. 

 

4.6 Meanwhile, receipts from CHED amounting to P164,800.00 which were 
already credited in 2020 to the Institute’s account intended for TES- 

NonListahan 2.0 grantees for AY 2018-2019 are yet to be distributed. 

 

4.7 The Institute utilization of TES Grants from CHED-UNIFAST for AY 2018-
2019 showed that student beneficiaries were paid TES allowances amounting 

to P7,460,000.00 while the Institute incurred administrative cost amounting to 

P20,800.00, leaving an unexpended balance of 26.79 percent or 

P2,736,800.00, summarized as follows:

(RA 10687) on the Financial Management and Accountability states that: “All 



77 

 

funds allocated to the government StuFAPs for the tertiary educaton shall be 

managed according to standard government accounting and auditing rules 

and regulations. In addition, specialized processes and procedures shall be 

developed to enhance transparency and accountability suitable to the 

program or project for which the fund has been provided.” 

 

4.13 Our verification of the Institute’s pro-forma entries in recording the receipt 
and release of TES grants are as follows:

4.14 The above  process of the Institute  in recording the fund received is  contrary 
to Section 38 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, which provides the standards, 

policies, guidelines and procedures in accounting for other receipts of NGAs 

as follows: 

 

j. Intra-agency and inter-agency fund transfers. Cash received from 

Central Office/Regional Office/Operating Units of an entity and from 

another entity for the purpose of implementing specific projects.

Due to NGAs 20201050  XXXX 

(To recognize receipt of inter-entity fund transfer)  
 

4.15 The account Due to NGAs is defined in Chapter III of the GAM for NGAs, 
Volume III as the account used to recognize the receipt of funds for delivery 

of goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers from NGAs, other than 

the BIR, for implementation of specific programs or projects and other inter-

agency transactions and should be debited for delivery of goods /services, 

liquidation of funds received and settlement of liabilities. 

 

4.16 The balance of the account shall at all times be reconciled with the account 
maintained in the other national government agency after settlement of inter-

agency and/or inter-office transactions, to ascertain the accuracy and 

completeness of recorded transactions.  

 

 

 

 



78 

 

a) Non-maintenance of separate Bank Account/ SL 
 

4.17 Section 111 on keeping of accounts as required by PD No. 1445, otherwise 
known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, states that: 

 

(1) The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is 

necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be 

adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies 

of the government. 

 

(2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall 

be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate 

or misleading information. 

 

4.18 Further, Section 114 of the same Decree states that:  
 

  i.The government accounting system shall be on a double entry  

  basis with a general ledger in which all financial transactions  

  are recorded; and 
 

  ii. Subsidiary records shall be kept where necessary. 

 

4.19 Further, Rule 6.2 of the IRR of the UniFAST states that: “A separate book of 
accounts shall be kept by each implementing agency for the UniFAST StuFAP 

funds. The book of accounts shall follow standard government rules and 

regulation for accounting. xxxx” 
 

4.20 Moreover, for proper implementation of the billing and disbursement 
procedures and monitoring of the TES payments to public and private HEIs,  

Joint Memorandum Circular (JMC) No. 04 s.2020 was issued to further set out 

enhanced guidelines on the TES program. Section XII of the said JMC 

specifically mentioned that Higher Education Institutions should: 
 

(7.6.1) xxxx; 

(7.6.2) Maintain a separate bank account with the Land Bank of the 

Philippines, for proper management of TES; 

(7.6.3) Provide bank account details for cheque received from the 

CHED Regional Office, to the proper account maintained; 

(7.6.4) xxxx; 

(7.6.5) xxxx; 
 

4.21 During our course of audit, we have noted that the EARIST did not maintain a 
separate bank account for the amount received for the TES program. Instead, 

the fund that it received from the CHED-UniFAST is being deposited in the 

Institute’s Regular Trust Fund bank account contrary to Section XII, Item 7 of 

the JMC No.004 s.2020. 

 



79 

 

b) Non- submission of mid-year and annual report to UniFAST Board 
 

4.22 During our inquiry,  it was noted that Institute does not submit mid-year and 
annual reports to the UniFAST Board contrary to Rule 6.2 of the 

Implementing Rules and Regulations of the UniFAST, to wit: 

 

Xxxxx. 

A mid-year and annual report shall be provided by all implementing 

agencies and  submitted to the Board. The report shall have two parts: 

a financial statement and a report  of operations showing the 

accomplishments of the fund. These reports, which  shall  be endorsed 

by the Board and submitted to Congress and the Department of Budget 

and  Management, shall be made accessible to interested parties 

within reasonable  office hours.  Interested parties shall also have 

access to the list of beneficiaries and the amount  of financial 

asssistance received by them during reasonable office hours. 

 

c) No Disclosures were made in the Notes to the FSs 
 

4.23 During our audit of the Institute’s Notes to FSs for the year ended December 
31, 2020,  it was observed that no proper dislosures have been made to reflect 

the amount of funds received for the implementation of the TES program. 

 

4.24 The purposes of Notes to FSs are provided in IPSAS 1, Paragraph 127, as 
follows: 

 

The notes shall:  
 

(a) Present information about the basis of preparation of the financial 
statements and the specific accounting policies used, in accordance 

with paragraphs 132-139; 
 

(b) Disclose the information required by IPSASs that is not presented on 
the face of the statement of financial position, statement of financial 

performance, statement of changes in net assets/equity, or cash flow 

statement; and  
 

(c) Provide additional information that is not presented on the face of 
the statement of financial position, statement of financial 

performance, statement of changes in net assets/equity, or cash flow 

statement, but that is relevant to an understanding of any of them. 

 

4.25 Further, Section 29, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I further states 
that the Notes to FSs must contain information in addition to that presented in 

the SFPos, SFPer, SCNA/E, SCF and SCBAA. Notes provide narrative 

descriptions or disaggregation of items disclosed in those FSs and information 

about items that do not qualify for recognition in those statements. The non-



80 

 

compliance of Management with IPSAS 1, paragraph 127 renders its Notes to 

FSs incomplete and could be unreliable, and incomparable.  

 

4.26 We recommended that EARIST Management: 
 

a. maintain a separate bank account and SL for the TES fund for proper 
account management; 

 

b. return any unused fund and submit the liquidation report to CHED; 
c. submit mid–year and annual reports as required under Rule 6.2 of the 

IRR of the UniFAST ( RA No. 10687); 

 

d. thru the Accountant: 
 

• record the receipts and liquidations of the TES grants in 
accordance with Section 38 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and 

 

• include the amount of funds received for the implementation of the 
TES program in the Notes to FSs; and 

 

e. thru the UniFAST Focal Person: 
 

• closely monitor and strengthen the coordination with the 
concerned office of CHED thru its representative on the release of 

grants and its related documents to facilitate the timely release of 

fund to student beneficiaries; and  

 

• comply with stricter deadline in the submission of requirements to 
avoid delay on stipend release. 

 

4.27 The Management commented that they will coordinate with the Bureau of the 
Treasury (BTr) on the opening of a separate bank account for TES fund and 

will inform the Audit Team on the result of the coordination. 

 

4.28 Amount granted for CY 2019 has been liquidated and for CY 2020, reports are 
being prepared for submission. In coordination with the Budget Services, the 

balances of various TES Program will be adjusted to Due to NGAs account 

and will be reflected in CY 2021 FSs. The reconciliation for various subsidy 

program is currently being prepared. Also, the funds that will be received by 

the Institute will be presented in the Notes to FSs in CY 2021 and succeeding 

years. 

 

4.29 There is a close coordination between EARIST and CHED,  however,  
EARIST does not have control as to when funds will be available; they are 

doing their best to make sure that scholars will be able to get their stipends as 

soon as funds are released. Delays are also brought about by the delay in the 



81 

 

downloading of funds, which is also the problem being encountered by the 

other SUCs/LUCs. 

 

Undeposited Interest Income  

 

5. Interest income amounting to P757,433.97, earned in bank accounts of RTF, 
were not remitted to the National Treasury (NT), inconsistent with the 

provisions stated in Section 4 of General Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal 

Year 2020 or Republic Act (RA) No. 11465 and Section 65 of Presidential 

Decree (PD) No. 1445. 

 

5.1 Section 4 of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year 2020 or 
Republic Act No. 11465 provides the following provisions for receipts or 

revenues collected by the Agencies: 

 

As a general rule, all fees, charges, assessments, and other receipts or 

revenues collected by departments, bureaus, and offices of the National 

Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy 

in the exercise of their mandated functions, at such rates as are now or 

may be approved by the appropriate approving authority shall be 

deposited to the National Treasury as income of the General Fund 

pursuant to Section 44, Chapter 5, Book VI of E.O. No. 292 s. 1987 

and Section 65 of P.D. No. 1445. (Emphasis supplied) 

 

Exceptions to the foregoing are: (a) Receipts authorized by law to be 

recorded as a Special Account in the General Fund, Trust Fund, or a 

Fund other than the General Fund shall be established in accordance 

with rules and regulations as may be issued by the Permanent 

Committee (the “Permanent Committee”) created under Section 45, 

Chapter 5, Book VI of EO No. 292.  The said special funds may be made 

available for expenditure, subject to any special provision of the 

agencies concerned; and (b) other instances authorized by law. 

 

5.2 Section 4, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I states the same 
provisions regarding “Fundamental Principles for Revenue.” All revenues 

accruing to the NGAs shall be governed by the following fundamental 

principles: 

 

a) Unless otherwise specifically provided by law, all revenues accruing 
to an entity by virtue of the provisions of existing law, orders and 

regulations shall be deposited/remitted in the National Treasury 

(NT) or in any duly authorized government depository, and shall 

accrue to the General Fund (GF) of the NG. (Sec. 65(1), PD No. 

1445) 

 



82 

 

b) Except as may otherwise be specifically provided by law or 
competent authority, all moneys and property officially received by a 

public officer in any capacity or upon any occasion must be 

accounted for as government funds and government property. (Sec. 

42, Chapter 7, Title I(B), Book V, EO No. 292) 

 

c) Amounts received in trust and from business-type activities of 
government may be separately recorded and disbursed in 

accordance with such rules and regulations as may be determined 

by a Permanent Committee composed of the Secretary of Finance as 

Chairman, and the Secretary of Budget and Management and the 

Chairman, COA, as members. (Sec. 65(2), PD No. 1445) 

 

d) Receipts shall be recorded as revenue of Special, Fiduciary or Trust 
Funds or Funds other than the GF, only when authorized by law as 

implemented by rules and regulations issued by the Permanent 

Committee. (Sec. 66, P.D. No. 1445) 

 

5.3 Audit of EARIST records revealed that one out of many accounts maintained 
in the LBP, used as depository account for its RTF, was earning interest 

income. It was observed, however, that the interest income earned was 

retained in the account and was not deposited with the National Treasury as 

income of the General Fund pursuant to Section 44, Chapter 5, Book VI of EO 

No. 292 s. 1987 and Section 65 of PD No. 1445. 

 

5.4 The employee handling the account confirmed that it was the practice ever 
since she assumed office. Also, no record was maintained to determine how 

much was the accumulated interest income earned ever since the RTF account 

was opened. 

 

5.5 Due to lack of time and unavailability of documents, interest earned prior to 
CY 2014 cannot be ascertained at the moment. Verification from the available 

data, previous reports and submitted Bank Statements, however, showed that 

from CYs 2014 to 2018, the RTF account of EARIST was able to earn a total 

of P757,433.97 interest income, breakdown is as follows:

Total Amount   757,433.97  



83 

 

5.6 We understand that SUCs are explicitly allowed by laws and regulations to 
accrue all revenue, income, receipts and collections, to be deposited in the 

account of the Special Trust Fund and Revolving Fund.  In fact, all revenues 

earned on the funds are governed by the following laws and regulations: 
 

a. Special Trust Fund - COA Circular No. 2000-002 dated April 4, 2000 
states that “Each University/College shall open a separate bank account 

for the STF wherein all income collections shall be deposited. All interests 

that shall accrue therefrom shall form part of the same Fund and shall 

be reported as interest income.”; and 
 

b. Revolving Fund - Section 9 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 
2020 states that “Revolving funds shall be established and maintained only 

if expressly created and authorized by law or this section.  Receipts 

derived from the following may be constituted into a revolving fund and 

made available for the purposes stated: (a) rentals for the use of buildings 

and facilities or from fees imposed for board and lodging, by agencies to 

be used for the MOOE or Capital Outlay requirements of said buildings 

and facilities, subject to any guidelines issued by the agency concerned 

and to budgeting, accounting and auditing rules and regulations; and (b) 

other business-type activities of agencies, including sale of product, which 

are authorized by law or by the Permanent Committee to be utilized for 

the operational expenses of said business-type activity, subject to any 

conditions prescribed under the special provision of the agency concerned 

and the rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Permanent 

Committee.  Revolving funds shall be separately recorded and deposited in 

an authorized government bank, and considered self-perpetuating and 

self-liquidating.” (Emphasis supplied) 

 

5.7 Only the Special Trust Fund and Revolving Fund are qualified as an exception 
stated in Section 4 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020.  Other 

than these funds, income earned in various bank accounts under Regular Fund 

and RTF should be remitted to the National Treasury. 

 

5.8 We recommended that Management provide a legal basis for the 
retention and accumulation of the interest income earned in its RTF, 

otherwise account for all the interest income earned since the opening of 

the account and deposit the amount accrued to the National Treasury as 

income of the General Fund pursuant to Section 44, Chapter 5, Book VI 

of EO No. 292 s. 1987 and Section 65 of PD No. 1445. 

 

5.9 Management commented that the interest income for CYs 2014-2020 
amounting to P757,433.97 will be remitted to the National Treasury in April 

2021. They will try to locate any available document to account for the 

interest for CY 2013 and preceding years. They will also communicate with 

the LBP if they can provide a report on the interest earned by the account 

since its opening.

Accumulated Balance for Payroll Fund 

 

6. The Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Savings Account (Payroll Fund) balance 
as of December 31, 2020 amounting to P138,089.07 pertains to unclaimed 

salaries and wages with no supporting documents and are outstanding for two 

years and above, contrary to the rules on the Grant of Cash Advance for 

Payroll in the GAM for NGAs, Volume I and Section 98 of the Presidential 

Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Section 1 of Executive Order (EO) No. 87. 

 

6.1 Section 15, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume III pertaining to Cash 
Advances for Payroll requires the following: 

 

Xxx It shall be equal to the net amount of the processed payroll 

corresponding to the pay period. Liquidation of the advances shall be made 

within five (5) days after the end of the pay period. Any unclaimed 

salaries/allowances shall be refunded and issued official receipt to close 

the account. 

 

6.2 Section 98 of PD No. 1445 states that “The Commission upon notice to the 
head of agency concerned, may revert to the unappropriated surplus 

[Accumulated Surplus] of the general fund of the national government, any 

unliquidated balance of accounts payable in the books of the national 

government, which has been outstanding for two years or more and against 

which no actual claim, administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is 

not covered by perfected contract on record.” 

 

6.3 Likewise, pursuant to EO No. 87 dated August 13, 2019, “all documented 
accounts payable for fiscal year 2016 and years prior thereto shall be 

reverted to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund, or the 

Cumulative Result of Operations of the National Government. Henceforth, all 

documented accounts payable which remain outstanding for at least two 

years, for which no actual administrative or judicial claim has been filed, 

shall be subject to automatic reversion.” 

 

6.4 EARIST maintains a Savings Account with the LBP, Malacañang Branch as 
the Payroll Account of EARIST where fund transfers for payment of salaries, 

wages and allowances are coursed through. 

 

6.5 The payroll of EARIST employees are processed based on the report of 
attendance of the employees for the month. The net pay accruing to EARIST 

employees are then transferred to the Payroll Account through List of Due and 

Demandable Accounts Payable with Advice to Debit Account (LDDAP-ADA) 

from the Cash-Modified Disbursement System (MDS) account. 

 

6.6 As of December 31, 2020, the Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Savings 
Account (Payroll Fund) under the Payroll Fund has a balance reported in the 



85 

 

FSs of P138,089.07. Analysis of the account and the BRS disclosed that the 

amount existed for more than two years and not supported with valid payees 

to whom those amounts are to be paid. Verification with the Management also 

revealed that they have no records maintained to identify the payees and the 

reason of the existence of the amount in the Payroll Fund. 

 

6.7 The accumulated Payroll Fund in the Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Savings 
Account is contrary to the rules governing cash advances for payroll stated in 

the GAM, which equally apply to the payment of salaries made through ATM 

such that the amount credited to the Payroll Fund shall be equal to the net 

amount of the processed payroll corresponding to the pay period. Liquidation 

of the advances shall be made within five days after the end of the pay period. 

This would mean that the amount that shall remain in the Payroll Fund after 

the end of the pay period shall only be equal to the maintaining balance of 

P10,000.00 as authorized by LBP for a Regular Checking/Savings Account of 

Government Line Agencies. 

 

6.8 Also, the existence of Due to Officers and Employees account representing 
unclaimed salaries/allowances for two years and above is contrary to the 

provisions of Section 98 of PD No. 1445 requiring reversion of the 

unliquidated balances of Accounts Payable to the unappropriated surplus of 

the general fund which has been outstanding for two years or more. 

Corollarily, the same principles apply to fund sources other than the Fund. 

 

6.9 We recommended that Management revert to the National Treasury the 
balance of Payroll Fund which represents unclaimed salaries/allowances 

which are not supported with valid payees and are outstanding for two 

years or more in compliance with the above provisions. 

 

6.10 The Management commented that they will revert to the National Treasury the 
unclaimed salaries/allowances amounting to P138,089.07. 

 

Compliance with RA No. 9184 and Other Pertinent Rules and Regulations 

 

7. Procurement contracts entered into by the Institute for CY 2020 totaling 
P37,065,955.83 were not fully compliant with the existing provisions of RA No. 

9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act, COA issuances and other 

related procurement rules and regulations due to:   a) delayed and non-

submission of procurement contracts; b) lacking and incomplete supporting 

documents; and c) non-compliance with the posting requirements, which 

precluded the Audit Team from the timely review of contracts, cast  doubt on 

the validity of transactions   and defeated  the purpose of the law on 

transparency, competitiveness and accountability. 

 

7.1 COA Memorandum No. 2005-027 dated February 28, 2005 states that it is 
essential that the review of contracts/transactions for the procurement of 



86 

 

government projects like infrastructure projects, goods and consulting services 

be conducted including the evaluation of the technical aspect of such 

contracts/transactions for post-audit purpose. Indeed, such review/evaluation 

process could be better facilitated if all the necessary documents and 

information are made available to the reviewer.  

 

7.2 The submission of all perfected contracts, together with their supporting 
documents within the prescribed period, was reiterated in COA Circular No. 

2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, emphasizing thereof the necessity to 

implement a systematic and effective contract review process to generate 

timely and relevant audit results.  In fact, Section 3.1.3 of the aforementioned 

Circular states that: 

 

For technical review purposes, submission of contracts and their 

supporting documents shall furthermore be guided by the specific 

documentary requirements outlined in the attached checklist marked as 

Annexes “A” to “T” of this circular. 

 

7.3 The same COA Circular also prescribes the submission of contracts to the 
Commission, which states that: 

 

Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the 

government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, 

including government-owned and controlled corporations and their 

subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents 

forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to 

the Auditor of the agency concerned. In case of agencies audited on an 

engagement basis, submission of a copy of the contract and its 

supporting documents shall be to the Auditor of the mother agency or 

parent company, as the case may be. 

 

Item 4.1 - Any unjustified failure of the officials and employees 

concerned to comply with the requirements herein imposed shall be 

subject to the administrative disciplinary action provided in (a) Section 

127 of Presidential Decree No. 1445; (b) Section 55, Title I-B, Book V 

of the Revised Administrative Code of 1987; and (c) Section 11 of 

Republic Act No. 6713. xxx 

 

7.4 The 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 or the Government Procurement Act 
was also issued for the purpose of prescribing the necessary rules and 

regulations for the modernization, standardization, and regulation of the 

procurement activities of the Government of the Philippines (GoP). 

 

7.5 For CY 2020, the EARIST entered into contracts with the various suppliers 
with a total contract amount of P37,065,955.83. Details of the contracts are

7.6 The initial results of audit and contract review revealed deficiencies such as: 
a) delay and non-submission of original/authenticated copies of contracts; b) 

lack of required supporting documents and deficiencies in the submitted

documents; and c) non-compliance with the posting requirements, details are 

discussed as follows: 

 

a)  Delayed and non-submission of copies of procurement contracts 
 

7.7 Evaluation of the EARIST’s compliance with the prescribed submission 
period to COA of perfected contracts including supporting documents during 

the year showed that it was not able to submit copies of the contracts and the 

required supporting documents within five days after execution or issuance as 

required under Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 

12, 2009. 

 

7.8 Out of 17 contracts executed for the Calendar Year 2020, only ten contracts

7.9 Meanwhile, seven contracts, mostly executed and procured by means of or

7.10 We also noted that the submitted contracts and their attachments procured thru 
Small Value Procurement (SVP) were photocopies and not authenticated. The 



91 

 

general rule is that photocopies of documents are inadmissible. As held in 

various judicial rulings, and the “Best Evidence Rule” under Section 3, Rule 

130, Rules of Court-Rules of Admissibility, the documents submitted by the 

EARIST have no probative value and are unacceptable as evidence. 

 

7.11 Due to the delay/non-submission of the above contracts and their attachments, 
the timely validation and complete evaluation of the Agency’s compliance and 

observance with existing procurement laws, rules, and regulations could not 

be completely undertaken. 

 

b) Lack and/or incomplete supporting documents  
 

7.12 Auditorial and legal review and evaluation of the submitted contracts revealed 
lacking and/or incomplete supporting documents, while verification of the 

submitted documents showed deficiencies/inconsistencies, enumerated as

7.13 It was also noted that for all contracts submitted, there were no attached 
Certificates of Availability of Funds (CAF), contrary to Section 37, Chapter 2 

of GAM for NGAs Volume I, which states that “no funds shall be disbursed, 

and no expenditures or obligations chargeable to any department, office or 

agency without first securing the certification of its Chief Accountant as to the 

availability of funds and the allotment to which the expenditure or obligation 

may be properly charged.”  

 

7.14 Section 86 of PD No. 1145 also states that the CAF shall be attached to and 
become an integral part of the proposed contract, and “the sum so certified 

shall not thereafter be available for expenditure for any other purpose until 

the obligation of the government agency concerned under the contract is fully 

extinguished.” 

 

7.15 The stamp in the letter of intent signed by the FMS Director on the availability 
of funds pertains only to the allotment. The CAF is supposed to serve as a 

confirmation that the agency is ready to undergo procurement. Signed by the 

agency’s accountant, the CAF should show that cash allocation is available 

and that the obligation incurred can be actually paid. 

 

c) Non-compliance with the posting requirement as required under the IRR 
of RA No. 9184 

 

7.16 Section 21.2.1 of the IRR of RA No. 9184 on Advertising and Posting of the 
Invitation to Bid/Request for Expression of Interest provides that: 

 

21.2.1. Except as otherwise provided in Section 54.2 of this IRR and 

for the procurement of common-use goods and supplies, the Invitation 

to Bid/Request for Expression of Interest shall be: 

 

a) Posted at any conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the 
premises of the Procuring Entity concerned for seven (7) calendar 



93 

 

days as certified by the head of the BAC Secretariat of the 

Procuring Entity concerned. 

 

b) Posted continuously in the PhilGEPS website, the website of the 
Procuring Entity concerned, if available, and the website 

prescribed by the foreign government/foreign or international 

financing institution, if applicable, for seven (7) calendar days 

starting on date of advertisement; and 
 

c) Xxxx. 
 

7.17 Section 54.2 provides that “Xxx. For the following modalities, however, the 
BAC, through its Secretariat, shall post the invitation or request for 

submission of price quotations/proposals in the PhilGEPS website, the website 

of the Procuring Entity concerned, if available, and at any conspicuous place 

reserved for this purpose in the premises of the Procuring Entity for a period 

of at least three (3) calendar days.” 

 

7.18 Review of the EARIST’s compliance with the above posting requirement 
showed that though they were able to post all these procurements to the 

PhilGEPs, these were not posted in the Agency’s website and at any 

conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the premises of the Procuring 

Entity as required under the IRR. 
 

7.19 Moreover, the EARIST did not submit the proof of posting of the Notice of 
Award (NOA), Contract and Notice to Proceed (NTP) in the PhilGEPS 

website, the website of the Procuring Entity concerned, if available, and at any 

conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the premises of the Procuring 

Entity. 
 

7.20 Inquiry with the Management revealed that they only post in the PhilGEPS the 
NOA and NTP of procurements which were procured thru public bidding, 

which proof of posting were not yet submitted to COA for verification. For 

other modes of procurement, it is not their practice to post, contrary to Section 

54.3 of the same IRR which provides that: 

In all instances of alternative methods of procurement, the BAC, 

through the Secretariat, shall post, for information purposes, the 

notice of award, contract or purchase order, including notice to 

proceed if necessary, in the PhilGEPS website, the website of the 

Procuring Entity concerned, if available, and at any conspicuous place 

reserved for this purpose in the premises of the Procuring Entity, 

except for contracts with ABC of Fifty Thousand Pesos (₱50,000.00) 

and below. 
 

7.21 The non-compliance with the above posting requirements defeats the purpose 
of the law on transparency, competitiveness and accountability. 

 



94 

 

7.22 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. for succeeding contracts/agreements, make sure to submit 
immediately the required contracts- original and/or authenticated 

copies with the necessary supporting documents and annexes to COA 

within five days after their execution and issuance to facilitate the 

technical review thereof in compliance with COA Circular No. 2009-

001; 

 

b. address accordingly the deficiencies noted above and submit the 
contracts listed in Table 26, and the lacking supporting documents in 

Table 27 to avoid issuances of Notices of Suspension and/or 

Disallowance on related disbursements; and 

 

c. observe and comply with the posting requirements provided under the 
IRR of RA No. 9184 to ensure transparency, competitiveness and 

accountability to all procurement. 

 

7.23 Management commented that the reason of delays in the submission of 
contract is because Management has to wait for the notarized contract to be 

returned by the contractor to the Procurement Services. They already 

coordinated and submitted the lacking documents to the Audit Team. The 

BAC Secretariat was also advised to strictly comply with the requirement in 

terms of posting to the PhilGEPs website. 

 

Delayed Submission of FSs, Reports and Supporting Documents 

 

8. Substantial delay ranging from one to 318 days had been incurred in the 
submission of the required financial/budgetary reports/statements within the 

prescribed timeframe, contrary to COA Circulars and pertinent provisions of the 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I which precluded the Audit Team from conducting 

timely audit of the transactions and analysis/review of the Agency’s financial 

records, thus the latter could not also institute immediately the necessary 

adjustments/corrections and other remedial measures to avoid possible audit 

suspensions/disallowances in post-audit. 

 

8.1 The Head of the Agency, who is primarily responsible for all government 
funds and property pertaining to his Office, shall ensure that the required 

financial reports and statements are submitted by the concerned Agency 

officials in such form and within the period prescribed by COA.

8.2 Based on our records, the Accountant did not submit the said financial

audit/verification of the transactions/accounts and correction of

8.3 Section 122, Chapter 3 of  PD No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government 
Auditing Code of the Philippines, states that: 

 

Submission of Reports – (1) Whenever deemed necessary in the 

exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued 

by it require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, 

cashiers, disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, and 

other responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial 

balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and 

such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions. 

 

(2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the 

documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the 

suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have complied 

with the requirements of the Commission.  

 

(3) No appropriation authorized in the General Appropriations Act shall 

be available to pay the salary of any official or employee who violates 

the provisions of this section, without prejudice to any disciplinary 

action that may be instituted against such official or employee. 

 

8.4 Section 127, Chapter 4 of the same PD provides that “Xxx Repeated 
unjustified failure to comply with the requirements imposed in this Code shall 



97 

 

be conclusive proof that the public officer concerned is notoriously 

undesirable.” 

 

8.5 The non-submission/delay in the submission of the financial reports and 
documents precluded the timely verification/examination and analysis of the 

related accounts. Hence, corrections of errors/deficiencies that may be found 

in the course of audit, if any, could not be immediately undertaken. 

 

8.6 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. submit the reports within set deadlines and adhere strictly to the 
provisions of the abovementioned laws, rules and regulations;  

 

b. fast-track the preparation and submission of reports which are long 
overdue; and 

 

c. subject the officials and employees concerned to automatic suspension 
of their salaries and/or administrative disciplinary action for any 

unjustified failure to comply with the requirements on the submission 

of financial transactions, statements and reports as provided in 

Section 122 of PD No. 1445. 

 

8.7 Management commented that as much as they want to adhere to the set 
deadlines, the number of qualified personnel in the FMS vis-à-vis the volume 

of transactions/reports the Institute is regularly handling is inadequate. This 

problem was further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, thus they are 

asking for understanding. 

 

9. The regularity, validity, completeness and legality of the transactions with an 
aggregate amount of P60,320,738.99 in CY  2020 cannot be ascertained due to 

non-submission of DVs and other necessary/required documents, contrary to 

Sections 4 and 122 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and pertinent 

provisions of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

9.1 Chapter 6, Volume 1 of the GAM provides the basic requirements applicable 
to all classes of disbursements, to wit: 

 

• Existence of lawful and sufficient allotment certified as available by the 
Budget Officer; 

• Existence of a valid obligation certified by the Chief Accountant/Head of 
Accounting Unit; 

• Legality of transactions and conformity with laws, rules and regulations; 

• Approval of the expense by the Chief of Office or by his duly authorized 
representative; and 

• Submission of proper evidence to establish the claim. 
 



98 

 

9.2 Items 5 and 6 of Section 4 of PD No. 1445, which set forth the fundamental 
principles that govern the financial transactions and operations of government 

agencies, provide that: 

 

(5) Disbursements or disposition of government funds or property shall 

invariably bear the approval of the proper officials. 

 

(6) Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete 

documentation. 

 

9.3 Section 122 of PD No. 1445 provides that unjustified failure on the part of the 
official or employee concerned to submit the documents and reports 

mentioned herein shall be considered a ground for the automatic suspension of 

payment of salary until he shall have complied with the aforesaid 

requirements, without prejudice to any disciplinary action that may be 

instituted against him. 

 

9.4 Section 4 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 provides that the 
official involved in the daily recording of transactions in the books of accounts 

shall turn over the receipts and the disbursement records with all paid 

vouchers and documents evidencing the transaction to the Auditor within ten 

(10) days from date of receipt of said documents. 
 

9.5 DVs and their related documents for payments made by the Institute under 
Fund 101 and Fund 164 totaling to P60,320,738.99 (see Annex A for details) 

were not submitted despite our continuous follow–ups:

signatures of the approving official, to wit:

9.7 The absence of the foregoing documents significantly hindered the timely 
audit of the transactions, which impacts on the need to establish the regularity, 

validity, completeness and legality of these transactions as recorded in the 

Institute’s FSs. 

 

9.8 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. observe strictly the proper documentation of all transactions pursuant 
to Sections 4 and 122 of PD No. 1445 and pertinent provisions of the 

GAM for NGAs, Volume 1; and  

b. submit the necessary DVs with complete supporting documents to 
determine the regularity, validity, completeness and legality of the 

transactions; otherwise, a corresponding Notice of Suspension shall be 

issued covering the subject’s transactions for any unaccounted 

/unsubmitted documents. 

 

9.9 Management commented that they already submitted these reports. They also 
explained that the unsigned BUR and JEV submitted to the Audit Team was 

because at that time, signatory was on a Work-from-Home arrangement 

considering that at time, the area where she lives was on a lockdown. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

9.10 The Audit Team reiterates the timely submission of DVs supported with 
complete documentation within the prescribed timeline for post-

audit/verification to avoid issuance of NS/ND. 

 

OTHER COMPLIANCE ISSUES 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

10. EARIST allotted only P7,063,388.00 or 3.39 percent of the Institute’s total 
budget appropriations authorized under the General Appropriations Act 

(GAA) of P208,290,000.00 to support GAD plans and programs for CY 2020 in 

compliance with Item 6.1 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01. 

Out of the allotted amount, only 74.80 percent or P5,283,568.40 was utilized to 

undertake all of the GAD projected activities included in the GAD Plan and 

Budget (GPB), leaving a balance of P1,780,319.60 or 25.20 percent as unutilized 



100 

 

allotment, thus not fully compliant with the provisions of the foregoing Joint 

Circular and may have defeated the purpose for which the unutilized allotment 

could have benefited the GAD beneficiaries. 

 

10.1 Under Section 1 of Executive Order (EO) No. 273, on the approval and 
adoption of Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (PPGD) 

1995-2025, all government agencies, bureaus, offices and instrumentalities, 

including GOCCs, are mandated  to: (a) take appropriate steps to ensure the 

full implementation of the policies/strategies and programs/projects outline in 

the Plan; and (b) institutionalize GAD efforts in government by incorporating   

GAD concerns as spelled out in the Plan  in their planning, programming and 

budgeting processes. 

 

10.2 The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, 
which shall be at least five percent of their budgets. For this purpose, activities 

currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that 

contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of 

marginalized women, protection, promotion and fulfillment of women’s 

human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered 

sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget 

shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said 

agencies. 

 

10.3 Item 3.3 of Joint Circular No. 2012-01 issued by the Philippine Commission 
for Women (PCW), National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) 

and Department of Budget and Management (DBM) provides further that 

GAD planning and budgeting shall be conducted annually as part of all 

programming and budgeting exercises of agencies. The Programs, Activities 

and Projects (PAPs) in the GPB shall be included in the agency’s budget 

proposal and they shall be reflected in the Annual Work and Financial Plan 

(WFP) of concerned offices or units within the agency or department. 

 

10.4 Item 6.1 of Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides that at least five percent of the 
total agency budget appropriations authorized under the annual GAA shall 

correspond to activities supporting GAD plans and programs. The GAD 

budget shall be drawn from the agency’s MOOE, CO and PS. It is understood 

that the GAD budget does not constitute an additional budget over an agency’s 

total budget appropriations. 

 

10.5 In addition, Items 11.1 and 11.2 of Joint Circular No. 2012-01 state that:  
 

Pursuant to Section 36 of the MCW, The Commission on Audit (COA) 

shall conduct an annual audit on the use of the GAD budget for the 

purpose of determining its judicious use and the efficiency and 

effectiveness of interventions in addressing gender issues towards the 

realization of the objectives of the country’s commitments, plans, and 



101 

 

policies on women’s empowerment, gender equality and GAD. Provided 

further in Section 37 of the MCW-IRR, the COA shall conduct an annual 

audit of GAD funds of all government agencies, offices, bureaus, SUCs, 

GOCCs, all government instrumentalities and all others concerned. 

 

10.6 For CY 2020, the EARIST total appropriation amounted to P208,290,000.00. 
At least five percent of the said appropriation or P10,414,500 was to be 

allocated for GAD programs and activities. Review of the Annual GAD 

Accomplishment Report of EARIST showed actual cost or expenditure 

amounting to P5,283,068.40 which was P1,780,319.40 or 25.20% lower than 

the GAD budget of P7,603,388.00. Details are shown in the succeeding table:

10.8 The Institute did not provide five percent of its annual budget for GAD’s 
Plans and Targets as provided for in Item 6.1of PCW-NEDA-DBM Circular 

No. 2012-01, which should have been P10,414,500.00 of the Institute’s 

allotment per GAA of P208,290,000.00. They were able to prepare only plans 

with budgeted amount of P7,063,388.00 or 3.39 percent of the total budget. 

 

10.9 The Institute did not effectively prepare GAD plans and budget using only 
P5,283,068.40 or 74.80 percent of the approved budget for GAD activities 

amounting to P7,063,388.00, thus leaving a balance of P1,780,319.60 

unutilized. 

 

10.10 The reduced setting-up of budget allocation for GAD may indicate that 
EARIST need to devise a well-prepared plan and activities with the 

corresponding budget to achieve the intended purpose for the benefit of GAD 

beneficiaries. 

 

10.11 We recommend that Management, thru the GAD Focal Committee, 
 

a. strictly comply with the requirements of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint 
Circular No. 2012-01 and fully attain the targeted activities;  

 

b. develop well-thought GAD Plan and activities that will be more 
responsive to the gender issues envisioned to promote gender equality 

among employees and clients; and 

 

c. monitor the implementation of the GAD Plan endorsed by PCW. 
 

10.12 Management commented that the target was not met because of the legal 
restrictions imposed by the government as stated in the IATF resolutions on 

the face-to-face activities and the implementation of the Enhanced Community 

Quarantine announced by Mayor Isko Moreno and Pres. Rodrigo Roa Duterte 

from March 14, 2020 to May 31, 2020, as well as the General Community 

Quarantine from June 2020 onwards. 



105 

 

 

10.13 To avoid the issuance of AOM in the future, the Office of Extension and 
Community Services-Gender and Development will be embracing the 

recommendations enunciated by the Audit Team to be able to address the 

gender issues and concerns of the Institute and for the realization of the 

objectives of the country’s commitments, plans, and policies on women’s 

empowerment and gender equality. 

 

Compliance with the Property Insurance Law 

 

11. Insurable assets of the Institute with a carrying amount of P385,209,126.23 as 
of December 31, 2020 were not insured with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) 

of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), contrary to RA No. 656, 

as amended, thus these properties are exposed to the risk of not being 

indemnified for any damage to or loss due to fire, earthquake, storm or other 

unforeseen events. Moreover, the EARIST did not submit Property Inventory 

Form (PIF) as required under COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018. 
 

11.1 RA No. 656, or the Property Insurance Law was enacted to establish a 
“Property Insurance Fund,” the administration of which was placed under the 

GSIS. It was amended by PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973, which requires all 

government agencies to have their insurable properties, assets, and interests 

insured with the GIF administered by the GSIS to ensure compensation of the 

equivalent value thereof in case of loss thru fire, theft or any unforeseen 

events. 
 

11.2 The Office of the President and the COA, have been persistent in reminding 
all National Government Agencies (NGAs) to enforce compliance with RA 

No. 656, thus the following issuances have been issued: 

 

a) Memorandum Circular No. 634 dated May 10, 1973 – requiring all 
departments, bureaus, offices, agencies and instrumentalities of 

government, all provincial, city and municipal governments and 

government-owned and controlled corporations to insure their properties 

and assets in accordance with the Property Insurance Law; 

b) COA Circular Nos. 79-112 dated August 30, 1979 and 92-390 dated 
November 17, 1992 – to assist the GSIS in implementing the Property 

Insurance Law; 

 

c) Administrative Order No. 33 series of 1987 – prescribing guidelines for 
insurance of all properties, contracts, rights of action and other insurance 

risks of the government, including those in which the government has an 

insurable interest, with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the 

Government Service Insurance System (GSIS); and 

 

d) COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 – prescribing the 
submission of the Property Inventory Form (GIF) as basis for the 



106 

 

assessment of  general insurance coverage over all insurable assets, 

properties and interests of the government with the General GIF of the 

GSIS. The Circular was issued to assist in the implementation of the 

provisions of RA No. 656 on the insurance and bonding of risk on 

insurable government assets and properties with the GIF. 
 

11.3 Records of the Institute showed that its reported PPE as of December 31, 2020 
totaled P385,209,126.23, net of accumulated depreciation. This amount, 

however, does not reflect the accurate amount due to the non-maintenance by 

Management of Property Cards and Property Ledger Cards. Breakdown of 

properties is shown below:

11.4 Evaluation of the Institute’s compliance with the Property Insurance Law 
revealed that there was no allocation provided for the insurance premiums of 

the insurable properties of EARIST for CY 2020, thus insurable properties 

were uninsured under the GIF of the GSIS. For the year, they were able to pay 

only the insurance premium of P3,410.96 for one Motor Vehicle. This has 

been a yearly observation of COA and it was recommended and reiterated in 



107 

 

the prior years’ audit reports for them to provide budget for the payment of 

insurance premium. 

 

11.5 In the absence of an insurance coverage, the properties of the government are 
not amply protected from the risk of non-indemnification in case these will 

suffer any damage or loss due to fire, earthquake, storm or other fortuitous 

events. By securing property insurance, the Agency mitigates the risks of non-

indemnification in case of loss and ensures the protection of government 

resources. 

 

11.6 Section 5.3 of COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 provides that: 
 

The head of the Agency, Accountant, Property Officer, Administrative 

Officer, Cashier, Treasurer, or any government official of the National 

Government Agencies/Local Government units/Government-Owned or 

Controlled Corporation, who are responsible for the payment of the 

premiums prescribed, who refuses or habitually neglects to comply 

within the time prescribed, shall be held liable for the payment of said 

premiums and shall pay GSIS a fine of two per centum (2%)  per month 

of said premiums from their due dates until received by the GIF as 

provided under Section (b) of RA No. 656. 

 

11.7 Moreover, the EARIST did not prepare and submit the PIF to the Office of the 
Auditor, contrary to the above Circular, which requires pertinent officials to 

prepare the PIF listing all the insurable properties and other assets, showing 

their latest appraised values/valuation, appraisal date, location and other 

information as annexed thereto, and submit the same to the Supervising 

Auditor or Audit Team Leader, and the GIF, GSIS, not later than April 30 of 

each year. 

 

11.8 Section 5.5 of the same Circular provides that: 
 

Failure on the part of the agency officials concerned and the GSIS to 

submit and receive, respectively, the documents and reports mentioned 

therein, as well as the failure of the GSIS underwriting officials to 

assess the premium due within the timeframe herein prescribed, shall 

subsequently cause the suspension of the payment of their salaries until 

they shall have complied with the requirements of RA No. 656 and its 

IRR, as well as the provisions of this Circular. 

 

11.9 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. provide an annual budget for the payment of property insurance 
premiums; 

 



108 

 

b. prepare and submit the required PIF containing accurate valuation of 
the properties reported therein, and submit the same within the 

prescribed timeline in compliance with COA Circular No. 2018-002 

dated May 31, 2018; 

 

c. immediately secure property insurance of its uninsured assets, in 
compliance with the rules and regulations of RA No. 656, as amended 

by PD No. 245, and record payment of insurance premiums as 

prescribed; and 

 

d. impose the sanctions provided on the concerned officials who did not 
comply or caused the non-compliance with the above provisions. 

 

11.10 Management commented that the Institute allocated a budget for its Property 
Insurance Premium amounting to P9,383,511.93. This was included in the 

CY 2021 BOT Approved Financial Plan for Special Trust Fund. Upon 

request of the Property Management Service, EARIST could make the 

obligation and subsequent disbursement related to the insurance premium 

subject to the completeness of the submitted documents. 

 

11.11 PMS is half-way with the CY 2018 Report on the Physical Count of 
Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE).  However,  they are yet to finalize 

it since the PMS staff assigned to do the job has resigned and there is no 

replacement yet.  For the meantime,  the PMS Chief will try to find time to 

continue preparing the report including the review so the report can be 

finalized.     

 

11.12 Management also received list of requirements to secure property insurance 
from GSIS, to wit: 

 

a. Certificate of ownership of property – unable to secure since even the 
Records Management Services Office  does  not have it; 

 

b. Certificate of Occupancy -  no available record on file.  The 
Administrative Services Director has coordinated with the City Engineers 

Office of the Manila City Hall to secure said certificate; 

 

c. Inventory List of Properties -  FMS has finalized their CY 2020 schedule 
of PPE for Fund 164 and if authorities will allow,  this will be used as 

basis for insurance coverage. As for Fund 101 and Fund 151,  the CY 2018 

PPE report, which they are currently preparing, will be the basis; 

 

d. Vicinity Map – IIPDO will be preparing the map as of this date;  
 

e. Building Plans –As of date, only the as-built plans for the Amphitheater, 
CIT Building, Main Building  and the Main Quadrangle are available;   



109 

 

 

f. Certificate of Availability of Funds -  FMS will provide; and 
 

g. Letter request to GSIS for coverage – will be prepared once all 
requirements have been completed. 

 

11.13 The concerned personnel are trying their best effort to comply with audit 
findings but there are circumstances that are beyond their control especially 

during this time of pandemic, so they are appealing for the Audit Team’s 

consideration on the matter. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

11.14 The Audit Team reminds the Management that since the fund used will be 
sourced from STF, such use of fund must be compliant with the CHED 

Memo on the use of income. Also, the Audit Team would like to emphasize 

the necessity of insurance, thus we require the Management to exert extra 

efforts and present a clear plan of action on how to complete and comply all 

the necessary requirements to be submitted to GSIS. 

 

Senior Citizens and Differently-Abled Persons 

 

12. EARIST submitted its Comprehensive Plan and Budget formulated for the 
implementation of Programs and Projects related to Senior Citizens and 

Persons with Disabilities (PWD) for CY 2020, with an approved budget of 

P2,107,821.43 or one percent of its total budget appropriation authorized 

under RA No. 11465 or GAA for FY 2020 of P208,290,000.00, but only five 

out of nine targeted activities were implemented, contrary to Section 32 of the 

General Provisions thereof. 

 

12.1 Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, otherwise known as 
the GAA for FY 2020, requires all agencies of the government to formulate 

plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of Senior 

Citizens and PWD, insofar as these relate to their mandated functions, and 

integrate the same in their regular activities. 

 

12.2 Moreover, all government facilities, including infrastructure, non-
infrastructure and civil works projects of the government, as well as office 

buildings, streets and highways shall provide architectural features, designs or 

facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of 

persons with disabilities pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 (An Act to 

Enhance the Mobility of Disabled Persons xxx) and RA No. 7277 (Magna 

Carta for Disabled Persons and for Other Purposes)

12.5 Based on our interview, we learned the reasons for non-implementation of 
some planned activities, as follows: 

 

a. due to legal restrictions imposed by the government as stated in the IATF 
resolutions on the face to face activities; 

 

b. the implementation of the Community Quarantine from March 14, 2020 to 
May 31, 2020 and General Community Quarantine from June to October 

2020; 

c. no face-to-face schooling; and  
 

d. re-scheduling of classes under EARIST Advisory No. 12 on Work 
Guidelines. 

 

12.6 It is safe to conclude that the reasons for non-implementation are justifiable, 
considering that the beneficiaries of this program are the Senior Citizens and 



112 

 

Persons with Disabilities. However, the Institute must still have to implement 

the separate programs or projects intended to address the concerns of senior 

citizens and persons with disabilities, as this is required under Section 32 of 

the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 (GAA for FY 2020), and monitor 

their implementation. 
 

12.7 We recommended that Management  
 

a. devise a comprehensive plan for Senior Citizens and PWDs with 
concrete targets, timelines and benchmarks, considering the allowable 

percentage based on its total budget appropriations as authorized by 

the GAA; and  
 

b. continuously facilitate monitoring of the progress of its 
implementation. 

 

12.8 Management commented that the programs and projects for the Senior 
Citizens and PWDs for CY 2020 was limited due to the legal restrictions 

imposed by the government as stated in the IATF resolutions for the non-face-

to-face activities.  Moreover,  implementation of the Community Quarantine 

also hindered the conduct of the Institute’s program and projects for the SC 

and PWDs. They will prepare a Comprehensive Plan with concrete target, 

timeline and benchmarks to facilitate the monitoring of the progress of 

implementtion to be able to address the concerns of the Senior Citizens and 

PWDs.    

 

Remittances to GSIS, BIR, PhilHealth and Pag-IBIG Fund 
 

13. For the CY 2020, EARIST has faithfully deducted from the salaries of its 
personnel the required taxes and premiums and remitted the same as well as 

the government share within the prescribed period to the concerned 

institutions or agencies as provided under pertinent rules and regulations. 

Beginning balances, however, from previous years remained unaccounted and 

unreconciled. 
 

13.1 Section 7 of the BIR Revenue Regulations No. 1-2013 dated January 23, 
2013 states that the due date for filing of tax returns withheld from suppliers 

should be on or before the 10th day following the month in which 

withholding was made, except for taxes withheld for the month of December 

of each year, which shall be filed on or before January 15 of the succeeding 

year. 

13.2 Section 14.1, Rule III of RA No. 8291, the GSIS Act of 1997, requires that 
each government agency shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and 

government agency’s contributions within the first ten days of the calendar 

month following the month to which the contributions apply. The remittance 

by the government agency of the contributions to the GSIS shall take priority 



113 

 

over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except salaries and 

wages of its employees. 
 

13.3 Section 3 (b and c), Rule VII of the IRR of RA No. 9679, the Home 
Development Mutual Fund Law of 2009, states that: 

 

b. Every employer required to set aside and remit such contributions 

as prescribed under RA No. 9679 and these Rules shall be liable 

for their payment, and non-payment thereof shall further subject 

the employer to a penalty of three percent (3%) per month of the 

amounts payable from the date the contributions fall due until 

paid. Every employer who actually deducts from the salary of his 

employee the latter’s loan amortization or payments to the Fund, 

as provided for under these Rules, shall be liable for their 

payment, and non-payment thereof shall likewise further subject 

the employer to a penalty of three percent (3%) per month of the 

amounts payable from the date the loan amortizations or 

payments fall due until paid. 

 

c. It shall be mandatory and compulsory for all government 

instrumentalities, agencies, including government-owned and 

controlled corporations, to provide the payment of contributions 

in their annual appropriations. Penal sanctions shall be imposed 

upon these employers who fail to include the payment of 

contributions on time, or delay the remittance of the required 

contributions to the Fund. The heads of offices and agencies shall 

be administratively liable for non-remittance of the required 

contributions to the Fund. 
 

13.4 As of December 31, 2020, the amounts withheld and remitted by EARIST 
are shown below:

13.5 We recommended that Management reconcile and investigate the causes 
of the unaccounted amounts and, accordingly, remit  the unremitted 

balance, if any,  and  prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct 

the amount reported. 

 

Status of Settlements of Audit Suspensions and Disallowances and Charges 

 

14. The total audit suspensions and disallowances amounting to P70,645,620.07 
and P118,191,367.79, respectively, remained unsettled as of December 31, 

2020. Out of the total Disallowances, P41,721,608.41 was with issued Notice of 

Finality of Decision (NFD) and COA Order of Execution (COE), of which 

P972,787.67 or 2.33 percent has been settled as of December 31, 2020, 

contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 2009-06 dated September 15, 

2009, which prescribes the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts. 

 

14.1 COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 prescribes the 2009 
Revised Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA), which 

provides, among others, that the Auditor shall issue a Notice of Disallowance 

(ND)/Notice of Charge (NC) for differences/balances resulting from the 

audit of the accounts. A Notice of Suspension (NS) may be issued pending 

compliance with various requirements for transactions, which may result in 

pecuniary loss to the government. The suspensions, disallowances and 

charges shall continue to be monitored and enforced by COA. 

 

14.2 Chapter II of COA Circular No. 2009-006 further states: 
 



115 

 

Section 7.1.1b The head of the agency who is primarily responsible for 

all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall 

ensure that the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within 

the prescribed period. 

 

Section7.1.3 He shall enforce the COE by requiring the withholding of 

salaries or other compensation due to the person liable in satisfaction of 

the disallowance or charge. 

 

Section 7.1.4 He shall ensure that all employees who are retiring or 

transferring to other agencies shall first settle the disallowances and 

charges for which they are liable. 

 

14.3 As of December 31, 2020, balances of NS and ND amounted to 
P70,645,600.07 and P118,191,367.79, respectively. (Annex B) 

 

14.4 For NSs, which the Management did not settle thru the submission of required 
documents, or which submission is incomplete, NDs were issued to replace 

the NSs. 

 

14.5 For NDs, 24 NFDs and COEs were issued totaling P41,721,608.41. Out of the

period of six months from receipt of the ND, in accordance with the 

RRSA; and 
 

b. enforce the COA Order of Execution (COE) by requiring the

satisfaction of the disallowance or charge, otherwise such payment to 

them will be disallowed in audit. 

 

14.7 Management commented that they already informed the persons liable to 
refund/settle the disallowances/suspensions within the prescribed period.  

They are also in the process of reconciling the data pertaining to all COE/NFD
