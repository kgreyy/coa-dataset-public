EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Institute for Labor Studies (ILS) was created on July 25, 1987, through 

Executive Order (EO) No. 251, in response to the growing need of the Department of 

Labor and Employment (DOLE) for more comprehensive and innovative research to 

back up its policy recommendations.  It traces its roots from the Institute of Labor and 

Manpower Studies (ILMS) created by virtue of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 620 issued 

on December 21, 1974 to provide then Ministry of Labor and Employment with technical 

support in policy-making and program implementation. With the issuance of EO No. 126 

on January 31, 1987, the ILMS was abolished and its research and publication functions 

were absorbed by the newly created Center for Labor Studies (CLS), which later became 

ILS on the same year. 

 

The ILS is the policy research and advocacy arm of the DOLE as provided in 

Section 3 of EO No. 251. It seeks to influence national labor and employment plans and 

policies through its research undertakings, projects and initiatives.  

 

The Institute is mandated to come up with relevant research information, studies, 

papers, materials, projects, seminars and activities that would be of help and value to 

labor policymakers, planners, advocates and workers.  The ILS also aims to undertake 

responsive and proactive policy research initiatives that are anchored on the DOLE’s 

three strategic themes, namely: employment and manpower development; labor relations; 

and labor standards and social protection. 

 

As an advocacy arm, the ILS promotes better labor policies in the Philippines 

through the accomplishment of its research and thrusts which are rooted in advancing the 

welfare and well-being of the Filipino worker. 

 

The ILS is led by Ms. Ahmma Charisma Lobrin-Satumba, Executive Director. It 

has four technical divisions, namely, the Employment Research Division, Workers’ 

Welfare Research Division, Labor and Social Relations Research Division, and the 

Advocacy and Publications Division. It is supported by the Finance and Administrative 

Division for its administrative functions. As at December 31, 2020, ILS had a total 

workforce of 43 regular personnel. 

 

B. Operational Highlights 
     

The ILS is mandated to implement the identified program which Organizational 

Outcome has four performance indicators as provided in the General Appropriations Act 

(GAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020. The Institute accomplished more than 100 percent of 

the total targeted eight policy research papers and it rendered 222 Technical Assistance 

papers or reports which were submitted on time out of the targeted 185 outputs or 96.10%

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the significant observations and recommendations, which were 

discussed with Management officials concerned, the details of which are discussed in 

Part II of the Report: 

 

1. The Institute accomplished 10 research papers more than its targeted eight 
research papers or 125 percent accomplished, and produced 222 technical 

papers/reports before the deadline or achieving 96.10 percent which is more 

than the 80 percent target based on the total 231 requests for the Calendar Year 

(CY) 2020.  Although the dissemination/distribution of the completed CY 2020 

research papers had been done thru electronic means, publication thereof 

through printed Journals has yet to be accomplished. (Observation No. 2) 



iv 

 

We recommended that the Management expedite the completion of the 

dissemination/distribution of its research paper in their final Journal form 

to their end-users and stakeholders as tool for a faster decision making in 

solving the issues with respect to labor and employment.  

  

2. Out of the ₱50,473,892.00 allotments received in CY 2020, the Institute 
obligated ₱47,350,915.50 or 93.81 percent, leaving an unobligated balance of 

₱3,122,976.50 or 6.19 percent unutilized budget as at yearend due to 

cancellation, postponement, and deferral of ILS activities which resulted in a 

decrease in budget utilization compared to previous years. (Observation No. 3) 

 

We commended the Management in its effort in implementing cost-cutting 

measures and reduction of related operating expenses showing an efficient 

utilization of financial resources.  However, in view of the effects of the 

Pandemic brought about by COVID-19, we recommended, and 

Management agreed, to reassess/refocus relevant research activities and its 

corresponding budget needs for a more improved budget utilization of its 

programmed appropriations for the ensuing year, while ensuring 

achievement of the target agency performance on its mandated research 

projects and activities. 

 

The aforementioned audit observations and recommendations were discussed with 

Agency Officials in an Exit Conference conducted on April 23, 2021, via zoom webinar 

and their comments were considered in the Report, where appropriate. 

  

G. Status of Settlement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 
 

There was neither  Notice of Suspension nor Notice of Disallowance issued in CY 

2020, and there were no prior years’ unsettled audit suspensions or disallowances/charges 

as of December 31, 2020.   

 

H. Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 

The Institute has fully implemented all or 100 percent of the five (5) prior year’s 

audit recommendations embodied in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report (AAR), as shown
