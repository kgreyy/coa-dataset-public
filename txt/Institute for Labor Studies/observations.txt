PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

Accounting Errors/Omissions 

 

1. Audit of the ILS financial statements (FSs) disclosed that  the same were free 
from any material misstatements and are prepared in accordance with the 

applicable and appropriate financial reporting framework of the International 

Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) with corresponding Philippine 

Application Guidance (PAG); and thus, became the basis in rendering an 

unqualified audit opinion on the financial position of the Institute as at 

December 31, 2020 and its financial performance, cash flows, changes in net 

assets/equity, comparison of budget and actual amounts and notes to financial 

statements for the year then ended. 

 

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 

Organizational Outcome – Research Papers 

 

2. The Institute accomplished 10 research papers more than its target of eight 
research papers or 125 percent accomplished, and produced 222 technical 

papers/reports before the deadline or achieving 96.10 percent, which is more 

than the 80 percent target based on the total 231 requests for the Calendar 

Year (CY) 2020.  Although the dissemination/distribution of the completed CY 

2020 research papers had been done thru electronic means, publication thereof 

through printed Journals has yet to be accomplished.  

 

2.1 The Institute or ILS is a policy research and advocacy arm of the Department 
of Labor and Employment (DOLE) as provided in Section 3 of Executive 

Order No. 251. The ILS seeks to influence national labor and employment 

plans and policies through its research undertakings, projects and initiatives.  

 

2.2 As a research institute, the ILS is mandated to come up with relevant research 
information, studies, papers, materials, projects, seminars and activities that 

would be of help and value to labor policymakers, planners, advocates and 

workers. It also aims to undertake responsive and proactive policy research 

initiatives that are anchored on the DOLE’s three strategic themes: 

Employment and manpower development; Labor relations; and Labor 

standards and social protection. 

 

2.3 In the GAA for FY 2020, the ILS has one Organizational Outcome with four 
performance indicators as its commitments corresponding to the Institute’s 

approved budget of ₱682,800.00 for the conduct of labor policy research

study.  The actual expenses incurred for the study totaled ₱194,528.37 for CY 

2020.  

 

2.4 For CY 2020, the Institute conducted, completed, and presented to users 10 
policy research papers, achieving 125 percent of the eight targets and it 

rendered on time 222 technical assistance papers or reports out of the 231 

target reports or 96.10 percent accomplished, surpassing its 80 percent target. 
 

2.5 One out of the 10 research papers was accomplished as desk research, which 
involved statistical analysis of survey datasets. The datasets used in the 

survey were purely online resources and email correspondence provided by 

the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). 
 

2.6 One research paper entitled, “Bike-to-Work Project: Exploring Alternative 
Mode of Commuting in the time of COVID-19,” was conducted as instructed 

by the Office of the Secretary to provide evidence as basis for the 

implementation of a bike-to-work program which was successfully launched 

in October of 2020. No expenses were incurred as the collection of data was 

done through online survey. 

 

2.7 Moreover, the Institute  submitted before the deadline a total number of 222  
out of the total number of 231 technical assistance requested /reports 

produced or 96.10 percent, exceeding the targeted 80 percent of the total 

number produced for CY 2020. Comparison of the CYs 2018 to 2020 targets 

and accomplishments also showed yearly accomplishments exceeding its 

targets of 80 percent, as presented in tTable 1 below:

2.8 The dissemination/distribution of the CY 2020 research papers was done 
electronically. Publication through printed Journals was included in their 

commitments for the CY 2021 Organizational Outcome in their Office 

Performance Commitment Review (OPCR), however, no target date was 

indicated for its accomplishment.  

 
 

2.9 We recommended that the Management expedite the completion of the 
dissemination/distribution of its research papers in their final Journal 

form to their end-users and stakeholders as a tool for a faster decision 

making in solving the issues with respect to labor and employment.   



35 
 

2.10 The Management informed the Audit Team that the ILS continuously find 
innovative ways to expedite the dissemination/distribution of final research 

outputs. A Research Conference, was scheduled to be conducted on the 2nd 

quarter of 2021 wherein the feedback from end-users and stakeholders thru 

the Certificate of Utilization and Satisfaction will also be gathered and 

considered in the publication of the research work. 

 

 

Budget Utilization 

 

3. Out of the ₱50,473,892.00 allotments received in CY 2020, the Institute 
obligated ₱47,350,915.50 or 93.81 percent, leaving an unobligated balance of 

₱3,122,976.50 or 6.19 percent unutilized budget as at yearend due to 

cancellation, postponement, and deferral of ILS activities which resulted in a 

decrease in budget utilization compared to previous years. 

 

3.1 Under the National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated January 6, 2020, 
item 3.4, it is provided that  with the adoption of the Cash Budgeting System 

(CBS) and consistent with Section 60, General Provisions of the FY 2020 

GAA, all appropriations authorized under the FY 2020 GAA, including 

budgetary support to GOCCs and SAGF, shall be available for release and 

disbursement for the purpose specified, and under the same General and 

Special Provisions of said GAA applicable thereto until December 31, 2020. 

The appropriations for Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) 

and Capital Outlay (CO) items under the FY 2020 GAA shall be valid for 

obligation until December 31, 2020. After the end of validity period, all 

unreleased appropriations or unexpended or undisbursed funds shall revert to 

the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund, in accordance with Section 

28, Chapter 4, Book VI of E.O. No. 2922 and shall not be available for 

expenditure except by subsequent legislative enactment. 

 

3.2 NBC No. 580 dated April 22, 2020 on the Adoption of Economy Measure in 
the Government due to Emergency Health Situation, which implement the 

provisions of Sec. 4 of RA 11469, directed the government instrumentalities 

that 35% of the programmed appropriations under FY 2020 GAA shall no 

longer be made available for release and discontinuance of the 10% released 

allotments for MOOE and CO, following economy measures on certain 

MOOE items. Likewise, government agencies are advised to evaluate the 

discontinuance of programs, projects and activities under the CY 2019 

Continuing Appropriations. 

 

3.3  In response to the said directives, the Institute received negative Special 
Allotment Release Order (SARO), amounting to ₱3,839,383.00 from the total 

released allotments from MOOE and CO with respect to the Current (CY 

2020) appropriations and the CY 2019 Continuing Appropriations.   



36 
 

3.4 The Institute also received negative GARO and SARO pursuant to DBM 
Circular Letter No. 2020-7 dated April 16, 2020 relative to the payment of 

Employer Government Share in Retirement and Life Insurance Premium 

(RLIP) Contribution to be remitted to the Government Service Insurance 

System (GSIS) amounting to ₱2,000,000.00 and ₱66,750.00, respectively. 

 

3.5 For CY 2020, the Institute received a total allotment of ₱50,473,892.00 and 
obligated 93.81 percent or ₱47,350,915.50 as per Agency’s Statement of 

Allotment, Obligation and Unexpended Balances (SAOUB) – BAR No. 4 and 

Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements, and 

Balances (SAAODB) - FAR No.1 as of December 31, 2020. Compared to the 

last two previous years, there was a considerable increase in the percentage of 

unobligated allotments in CY 2020, as shown in Table 2:

37 
 

3.7 The CY 2020 unobligated allotments of ₱3,122,976.50 were mostly attributed 
to the unutilized MOOE totaling ₱3,108,599.04, which resulted in savings on 

the part of the Agency. The unexpended allotment was due to the 

cancellation, postponement, and deferral of ILS activities in compliance with 

the adoption of economy measures in the government due to the emergency 

health situation. 

 

3.8 As justified by the Executive Director, the unutilized allotments for MOOE 
were due to:  

  

a. Deferral of the various planned procurement activities until easing of 
the restrictions set forth by the aforementioned Presidential 

proclamations; 

 
b. Delayed completion of installation of new air-conditioning units which 

resulted to the low consumption of electrical energy; 

 

c. Cancelled research fieldworks and events due to community 
quarantine declarations also affected the non/low utilization of foreign, 

local travel and other research related expenses. As an alternative to 

fieldworks/research related events, online or virtual consultations/ 

validations were held via video conferencing; 

 

d. Cancelled face-to-face employee trainings and seminars were also 
substituted by virtual or online trainings and seminars resulting to 

underutilization of funds specifically allotted for training related 

expenses; 

 

e. Implemented work-from-home (WFH) working arrangement also 
contributed to low utilization of utility expenses as well as low 

utilization of office supplies and materials as compared to the usual 

rate of consumption; 

 

f. The Institute was constrained to conduct various events that will 
require physical gathering or meetings which resulted to non-spending 

of budget specifically allotted for various management events and/or 

representation expenses; and 

 

g. The Institute incurred unpaid obligations from procured items (e.g. 
printing of publications) which can mainly be attributed to the request 

of extension of delivery in line with the restrictions and limitations 

brought about by the Pandemic. Another cause of unpaid obligations 

can be attributed to the late submission of documentary requirements 

(e.g invoices and billings) by the supplier thereby deferring payment 

of the said items in the first quarter of 2021. 

 



38 
 

3.9 Notwithstanding the unutilized allotments, the Institute achieved and even 
surpassed its target Organizational Outcome as discussed in Observation     

No. 2 of this report.  

 

3.10 We commended the Management in its effort in implementing cost-
cutting measures and reduction of related operating expenses showing an 

efficient utilization of financial resources.  However, in view of the effects 

of the Pandemic brought about by COVID-19, we recommended, and 

Management agreed, to reassess/refocus relevant research activities and 

its corresponding budget needs for a more improved budget utilization of 

its programmed appropriations for the ensuing year, while ensuring 

achievement of the target agency performance on its mandated research 

projects and activities. 

 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

4. ILS had integrated gender responsive programs, projects and activities in the 
regular programs of the Agency, accordingly allocated ₱2,500,000.00 which 

complied with the minimum five percent of appropriation allocation as GAD 

funds, and utilized ₱2,585,482.48, which is equivalent to 5.19 percent of the 

Agency’s appropriations, in compliance with Section 31 of the GAA of FY 

2020 and the provisions of RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women. 

 

4.1 Pursuant to Section 31 of the FY 2020 GAA, all agencies of the government 
shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their 

concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under 

RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination 

of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for 

Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-

2025), and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).   
 

4.2 The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, 
which shall be at least five percent of their budgets. For this purpose, 

activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or 

those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment 

especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of 

women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance, are 

considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the 

GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators 

identified by said agencies. The preparation and submission of the annual 

GAD Plan and annual GAD Accomplishment Report shall be subject to the 

guidelines issued by the agencies concerned. 

 

 

 



39 
 

4.3 Section 8 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides that: 

 

8.1 Pursuant to Section 37A.1 of the MCR-IRR, all agencies, offices, 

bureaus and all government instrumentalities and others concerned 

shall formulate their annual GAD Plans and Budgets (GPB) within the 

context of their mandates. 

 

8.2 The GFPS of the agency shall review all submitted GPBs and as 

needed, provide comments or recommendations for revision. Agency 

review of GPBs shall focus on the alignment of the GAD plan with the 

GAD agenda and the correctness and alignment of the entries in each 

column of the GPB template, e.g. if the proposed activities respond to 

the identified gender issue or cause of the issue, the issues are 

correctly identified or formulated, if there are clear indicators and 

targets, if the proposed budget is realistic, if the number of proposed 

activities are doable within the year, among others. The GFPS shall 

then submit the final GPBs and the corresponding GAD ARs to PCW 

for review and endorsement to DBM.   

 

8.7   Agencies shall submit their PCW-endorsed GPB to DBM along 

with their annual GAD Accomplishment Report for the previous year 

in accordance with the budget call.  

 

8.8 Once the GAA has been approved and where budget and program 

adjustments have to be made based on final agency budgets, agencies 

shall submit an adjusted GPB to PCW.  The adjusted GPB shall be the 

basis for implementing the GPB, as well as, for monitoring and 

reporting.  

 

4.4 The Agency complied with the provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna 
Carta of Women, that is, to formulate GAD Plan designed to address gender 

issues within their concerned sector or mandate. Moreover, the Institute’s 

GPB and GAD AR were reviewed and endorsed by the PCW, in compliance 

with Section 8 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01.  

 

4.5 For the CY 2020, the ILS allocated a GAD budget of ₱2,500,000.00 which 
met the minimum five percent of the agency appropriations allocation as 

GAD funds by attribution to the regular agency activities supporting GAD 

plans and programs in pursuance of Section 31 of the FY 2020 GAA. The 

GAD AR showed that the expenses spent for GAD activities totaled 

₱2,585,482.48 or equivalent to 5.40 percent of its total appropriations.  The 

GAD targets and accomplishments as reported in the GPB and the GAD AR 

are shown in Table 4 hereunder:

Programs for Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability 

 

6. The ILS conducted several programs and activities for Senior Citizens (SC) 
and Persons with Disability (PWD) in compliance with Section 32 of the 

General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020.  
 



42 
 

6.1 Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 provides that: 
 

All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects 

intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with 

disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the 

same in their regular activities. 
 

6.2 For CY 2020, the Institute included research and development and conducted 
events and activities to address concerns of senior citizens and persons with 

disability, as follows:  
 

a. To continuously enhance and transform DOLE into an efficient, 
responsive, purposeful, and accountable institution, the ILS conducted 

webinar activity entitled, “Zoomba At Iba Pa for Senior Citizens: Making 

the Digital World Age-Inclusive”. The objective of this webinar aims to 

serve as an opportunity to discuss individual and structural constraints to 

access of elderly to digital technologies, as well as identify areas for action 

toward harnessing opportunities for senior citizens to adapt to new 

technologies. 

 

b. The Institute conducted validation meeting that seeks to gather comments 
and inputs on the draft DOLE Disability Inclusive Governance Framework  

(DIGF) from the PWD focal point members and has created the draft 

DOLE DIGF, which highlights various strategies to improve the 

Department’s programs and frontline services, data and knowledge 

management, physical infrastructure, and ICT and IEC materials. By 

adopting this framework, the DOLE is a step closer towards becoming an 

efficient, responsive, purposeful, and accountable institution. 

 

6.3 We commended Management for the programs undertaken for Senior 
Citizens and PWDs and recommended that the Agency continue to 

include programs for their benefit relative to the agency mandated   

programs and research work. 

 

Remittances to BIR, GSIS, PhilHealth and Pag-IBIG Fund 

 

7. In compliance with the BIR, GSIS, PhilHealth and Pag-IBIG applicable laws
