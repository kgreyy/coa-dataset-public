OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

Property, Plant and Equipment 

 

1. The non-submission of the Report on the Physical Count of Property Plant and 
Equipment (RPCPPE) for Funds 101, 164, and 102 contravened Section 38 Chapter 

10 of GAM, thus casting doubt on the accuracy, completeness and existence of the 

said PPE accounts in the amount of P272,696,411.05 as at year-end as the balances 

could not be relied upon. 

 

Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 

states that “the Financial Statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial 

performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires faithful representation 

of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the 

definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in 

IPSAS.” The provision is also provided under Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government 

Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Sector (NGS) Volume I. 

 

 Likewise, Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 states that the accounts 

of the agency shall be kept in such details as necessary to meet the needs of the agency and 

at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by the fiscal or control 

agencies of the government. 

 

 Section 38 of the same Chapter requires that the entity shall have a periodic physical 

count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical 

Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as at December 31 of each year. This 

shall be submitted to the auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. 

 

Further, Section 122 of PD 1445 - Submission of Reports provides: 

 

Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the 

Commission may under regulations issued by it require the agency 

heads, chief accountant, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing 

officers, administrative officers or personnel officers and other 

responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, 

physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such 

other reports as may be necessary for the exigency of the functions. 

Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the 

documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause 

the suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have 

complied with the requirements of the Commission. 



62 

 

 

Section 58 of PD 1445 - Audit of Assets provides that: 

 

The examination and audit of assets shall be performed with a view 

to ascertaining their existence, ownership, valuation and 

encumbrances as well as the propriety of items composing the 

respective asset accounts, determining their agreement with records, 

proving the accuracy of such records; ascertaining if the assets were 

utilized economically, efficiently and effectively; and evaluating the 

adequacy of controls over the accounts. 

 

The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Davao del Norte State College 

showed a total of P272,696,411.05 for the Property, Plant and Equipment accounts, net of 

the Accumulated Depreciation as at December 31, 2020 which was not supported with the 

Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE), details of such 

balance are presented as follows: 

 

Account Amount 

Fund 101  

Land 16,135,236.00 

Infrastructure Assets 6,697,439.13 

Buildings and Other Structures 37,145,400.53 

Machinery and Equipment 12,771,360.93 

Construction in Progress 182,158,743.67 

Subtotal 254,908,180.26 

Fund 102  

Building and Other Structures 6,058,777.88 

Fund 164  

Infrastructure Assets 353,945.03 

Buildings and Other Structures 89,748.21 

Machinery and Equipment 7,866,643.88 

Transportation Equipment 1,473,000.00 

Furniture, Fixtures and Books 958,676.79 

Construction in Progress 987,439.00 

Subtotal 11,729,452.91 

Grand total P272,696,411.05 

 

 This is a reiteration of the previous year’s audit findings. To date, the RPCPPEs for 

all funds were not completely submitted to the Office of the Auditor. Only Funds 161 

amounting to P628,289.01 and 163 amounting to P8,034,184.62 were submitted. With the 

foregoing, the Audit Team was precluded from verifying the physical condition of the 

recorded Property Plant and Equipment in the books of accounts thereby materially 

affecting the accuracy and reliability of the reported balances in the financial reports as at 

year-end. 

 



63 

 

2. Delivered properties and equipment costing P184,940.00 were not recorded in the 
Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Cards (PPELC), hence, the balance of PPE 

and its related accounts in the financial statements is understated by the same 

amount. 

 

To check whether property and equipment delivered are recorded in the books of 

accounts, the Audit Team tested a sample of Inspection and Acceptance Reports (IAR) and 

traced the delivered equipment to the entries in the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger 

Cards (PPELC). The Audit Team found out that the following delivered equipment costing 

above the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 were not found/recorded in the PPELC as 

submitted to the Audit Team last January 20, 2021, viz:

Moreover, the non-submission of the report on physical count of properties under 

Fund 164, barred the audit team from verifying/confirming the properties’ existence. 

Inquiry disclosed that the Supply Officer is dependent and always relying on the annual 

Lapsing Schedule of the Accountant before the former completely prepares the RPCPPE. 

This could be one of the contributory factors on the non-submission thereof. It must be 

noted that the responsibility of the Supply Officer is to maintain property cards of all the 

PPEs owned by the College, to conduct a yearly physical count of PPEs and to render a 

report thereon in which the Supply Officer is the Chairperson of the inventory committee, 

distinct and separate from that of the Accountant’s records.  This is rightfully so, because 

this is based on the principle of segregation of duties to maintain a check and balance and/or 

internal control in the agency processes on PPEs. To maintain the adequacy of control 

processes, a regular reconciliation between the reports of the Supply Officer and the 

Accountant must be undertaken to identify the variances and to identify who is accountable 

for the property and that appropriate actions shall be made by both offices concerned.  

 

With the foregoing conditions, the non-submission of the Report on the Physical 

Count of Property Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) contravened Section 38 Chapter 10 of 



64 

 

GAM, thus casting doubt on the accuracy, completeness and existence of the said PPE 

accounts in the amount of P272,696,411.05 as at year-end. 

 

Recommendation/s: 

 

We recommended that Management direct the Property/Supply Officer and 

members of the Inventory Committee to submit the lacking RPCPPE within 5 days 

from receipt hereof and strictly observe the prescribed deadline in the submission 

thereof in accordance with the existing laws, rules, and regulations. Otherwise, cause 

the suspension of payment of salaries of personnel concerned until they shall have 

complied with the requirements of the Commission. 

 

Management’s Comment: 

 

 During the exit conference held on February 24, 2021 via Zoom Meeting, the 

Supply Officer updated the Audit Team that she already submitted the lacking RPCPPE 

for Fund 164 on same date. The Management acknowledged the Team’s audit observations 

as they will focus their attention on the Property/Supply Office starting CY 2021 and is 

contemplating on hiring additional manpower for the Property/Supply Office to help solve 

this recurring problem in the inventory-taking and the timely submission of reports on 

PPEs. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

 Management’s comments are well taken and shall regularly monitor its compliance 

on the proper sanctions to be imposed upon the personnel concerned for persistent failure 

to comply. The Audit Team asked for the Supply Officer’s full commitment in improving 

their compliance with the prescribed rules and regulations and also called on the College 

Accountant’s assistance for the Supply Office to finally implement the audit 

recommendations.  

 

 

Unliquidated Cash Advances 

 

3. Cash Advances totaling P70,742.24 remained unliquidated as at December 31, 2020 
contrary to the pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 

1997 and P.D. No. 1445, hence resulting in a huge balance of Advances to Special 

Disbursing Officers account and exposing government funds to possible loss or misuse 

and/or misappropriation. 

 

Section 89 of P.D. No. 1445 states that a cash advance shall be reported on and 

liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served. No additional 

cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance 

given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made. 

 

Furthermore, Section 5 of COA Circular No. 97-002 provides: 



65 

 

 

5. LIQUIDATION OF CASH ADVANCES  

 

5.1 The AO shall liquidate his cash advances as follows: 

  

5.1.3 Failure of the AO to liquidate his cash advances 

within the prescribed period shall constitute a valid 

cause for the withholding of his salary and the 

instruction of other sanctions as provided for under 

paragraphs 9.2 and 9.3 hereof. 

  

5.7 When a cash advance is no longer needed or has not been used 

for a period of two (2) months, it must be returned to or refunded 

immediately to the collecting officer. 

 

5.8 All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each 

year. Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any 

unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will 

issue the necessary official receipt. 

 

5.9 At the start of an ensuing year, a new cash advance may be 

granted, provided that a list of expenses against the previous cash 

advance is submitted. However, when no liquidation of the previous 

cash advance is received on or before January 20, the Accountant 

shall cause the withholding of the AO’s salary. 

 

 Our review of the financial statements for the year revealed that the Advances to 

Special Disbursing Officers has a remaining balance of P70,742.24, the breakdown of 

which is as follows:

Total   271,662.00 200,919.76 70,742.24   

 

As at December 31, 2020, some of these cash advances have already become due 

and demandable and yet the unexpended/excess amount had not been immediately 

returned, hence not fully liquidated contrary to the prescribed regulation and therefore 

exposing these funds to possible loss or misappropriation. As per regulation, when the 

previous cash advance had not been liquidated by January 20 of the ensuing year, no new 

cash advance may be granted and the Accountant shall withhold the AO’s salary. We have 

verified in the Schedule of Cash Advances Granted and Liquidated as at January 31, 2021 

that out of the P70,742.24, a total of P35,572.44 was liquidated before January 20, 2021 

thereby leaving a balance of P35,169.80 which were already outstanding for more than 90 

days to date. It must be noted that the law mandates that a cash advance shall be reported 

and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served in order that 

a proper accounting thereof shall be made. Otherwise, the personnel concerned shall suffer 

the penalty imposed under the law for non-rendition of accounts. 

 

In addition, the Audit Team has noted that additional cash advances were granted 

to Ms. Joy Sorrosa on October 1, 2020 and December 3, 2020 even though her previous 

cash advances were not yet liquidated which contravened Section 89 of P.D. No. 1445. 

 

Recommendation/s:    

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. Ensure that cash advances shall be liquidated in accordance with the 
provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. The officials 

and employees concerned shall effect immediate settlement of the same 

otherwise, the necessary sanctions for their non-settlement such as the 

withholding of the salary be applied; and 

 



67 

 

b. Avoid simultaneous granting of cash advances to Accountable Officers who 
still have outstanding or unliquidated balances so as to prevent accumulation 

of cash advances pursuant to Section 89 of P.D. No. 1445 and COA Circular 

No. 97-002. 

 

Management’s Comment: 

 

During the exit conference, the Accountant committed to be stricter in granting and 

monitoring of cash advances. Accountable Officers and employees will be refreshed on the 

rules on cash advances. 

 

As of today, the Accountant updated the Audit Team that the total amount of 

P70,742.24 was already fully liquidated, of which P32,278.80 was refunded in February, 

2021. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

 Management’s comments are well noted as the Audit Team will regularly monitor 

its compliance. 

 

 

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 

Non-maintenance of Cashbook 

 

4. Some Disbursing Officers of the College did not maintain their Cashbooks or the 
equivalent records to monitor the movements of their accountabilities contrary to 

Section 6 of COA Circular No. 97-002, thus hindering the timely reconciliation and 

determination of their accountabilities at any given time. 

 
Section 6 of COA Circular No. 97-002 HANDLING, CUSTODY AND 

DISPOSITION OF THE CASHBOOK  

 

6.1 A newly-appointed or designated AO shall start with a new cashbook. 

Before discharging his duties, the new AO shall be briefed by the 

Accountant and the Auditor on the proper recording of the transactions and 

other matters related to his work.  

 

6.2 The AO shall maintain separate cashbooks for salaries, wages, 

allowances, etc. and for petty operating expenses. The AO shall record the 

transactions in the prescribed cashbook daily. He may record each invoice/ 

receipt/voucher individually or the total disbursements for the day 

depending on the volume of the transactions.  

 



68 

 

6.3 The AO shall reconcile the book balance with the cash on hand daily. 

He shall foot and close the books at the end of each month. The AO and the 

Accountant shall reconcile their books of accounts at least quarterly.  

 

6.4 The cashbooks shall be kept at the Office of the AO and then placed 

inside the safe or cabinet when not in use. It may be taken from his custody 

only by the Auditor or an official duly authorized by the Agency Head, who 

shall issue the necessary receipt.  

 

Despite the threat brought about by the present Pandemic, the Audit Team 

conducted the examination of cash and accounts on all Accountable Officers (AOs) of the 

Davao del Norte State College on August 17, 2020.  During the examination of cash and 

accounts, it was disclosed that some designated Special Disbursing Officers did not 

maintain their cashbooks and or Cash Disbursements Records and Report of Cash 

Disbursements to show to the Audit Team that their records are being regularly reconciled 

with that of the records or subsidiary ledgers maintained by the Accountant.  

 

 Apparently, the Accountant did not require each Disbursing Officer (DO) to 

maintain a Cashbook because the former has already done close monitoring on the DOs’ 

Cash Advances and Liquidations.  Accordingly, the Accountant told the Audit Team that 

whenever the DOs brought the liquidation reports to her Office, the latter would only 

require them to prepare Report of Disbursements in support of the liquidation reports.   

Despite the close monitoring by the College Accountant, the above mentioned regulations 

require each AO to maintain a Cashbook and have it regularly reconciled with that of the 

records maintained by the College Accountant.   

 

To reiterate, the absence of each DO’s Cashbooks has resulted in the difficulty and 

untimely reconciliation of both records by the Accountable Officers and that of the College 

Accountant, at any given period. 

 

Recommendation/s: 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. Require the designated Accountable Officers/Disbursing Officers concerned 
to maintain the cashbooks and or Cash Disbursement Record (CDRec) to 

monitor the cash advances/payroll, current operating expenses, and 

special/time-bonded undertakings and prepare the Report of Cash 

Disbursements (RCDisb) to report fund’s utilization; 

  

b. Advise the AOs to regularly reconcile with the records maintained by the 
College Accountant; and 

 

c. Require also the concerned designated Disbursing Officers/Accountable 

Officers to certify the Cashbook/Cash Disbursement Record at the end of each 

month or when required to do so by the proper competent authority and also 



69 

 

certify the Report of Cash Disbursements on the last sheet of the report after 

the totals or when required to do so by the proper competent authority. 
 

Management’s Comment: 

  

 During the exit conference, the Management committed to take action on the Audit 

Team’s recommendations by conducting online re-orientation on the process of cash 

advance and liquidation on the 2nd quarter of 2021 and require the AOs to file RCDs and 

maintain and submit CDRs monthly to the Accounting Office to ensure compliance. 

  

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

 Management’s comment is well noted as the Audit Team will regularly monitor its 

compliance. 

 

 

Accumulated Housing Rentals 

 
5. Accumulated house rentals totaling P149,580.00 were not collected thru salary 

deductions from the employees and recognized organization of the State College 

contrary to the Board Resolution No. 48 s .2004, hence depriving the school of the 

funds to cover for the cost of maintenance of the subject facilities. 

 

Items 2 and 3 of BOT Resolution No. 48, s. 2004 stipulates that:  

 

2. The rental shall be deducted through salary deduction. 

3. The collection of rental shall take effect on November 1, 2004. 

  
The Davao del Norte State College has owned various buildings/housing units that 

shall be assigned/leased to recognized organizations/qualified personnel as recommended 

by the Committee in accordance with the Policy, Rules and Regulations subject to the 

approval of the College President.  All DNSC Faculty and Staff and recognized 

organizations shall be considered applicants for the housing occupancy of units and college 

buildings. All qualified occupants shall have to pay rentals categorized as follows:  

 

-For Staff Cottage - P1,000.00 per month at P300.00 per room and P100.00 for 

servant’s quarter with equal sharing or usage of kitchen and sala/living room areas; 
 

-For Clustered Apartment - P800.00 per month at P240.00 per room and P80.00. 

 

The above categorized rentals were implemented since November 1, 2004. These 

were not amended and updated until to date.  It is an internally generated income of the 

said College to cover for the maintenance of the said facilities. 

 

In CY 2020, the College should have generated P126,720.00 plus the arrearages of 

P160,600.00 as of December 31, 2019 or a total of P287,320.00, however, records showed 



70 

 

that the College collected only the total amount of P 137,740,00 during the period, leaving 

a difference/collectibles of P149,580.00. See attached schedule of actual occupants, type 

of units occupied, monthly rate, payments made during the year and their accumulated 

obligations/rentals to the college marked as ANNEX A. 

 

According to the College Accountant, the reason for the failure to deduct the rentals 

from the monthly payrolls of the actual occupants is that the management failed to enter 

into contract with some of the occupants and did not renew the contract of those having 

existing contracts years ago.  In addition, she reasoned that there was no records found that 

the particular occupant, who caused the huge collectibles, signed up a Memorandum of 

Agreement with the Davao del Norte State College.  However, she further reasoned that 

despite of this, she sent billing statements to all those actual occupants who failed to pay 

the rentals. 

 

As of December 31, 2020, an accumulated house rentals totaling to P149,580.00 

were not collected from the employees and recognized organization of the State College, 

depriving the school of the funds to cover for the cost of maintenance of the subject 

facilities. 

 

Recommendation/s: 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. Require the Housing Committee to prepare the Memorandum of Agreement 
and oblige all the actual occupants to enter into agreement with the authorized 

representative of the College and have it notarized; 

  

b. Require also the Housing Committee to include in the MOA all important 
provisions in the BOT Resolution No. 48 regarding collections of rentals to 

avoid accumulations thereof; 

 

c. Require the College Accountant to deduct outright from the monthly payrolls 
of the renters the unpaid rentals after the MOA has been signed and notarized 

by both parties to avoid accumulation of said rentals; and 

 

d. Require the Housing Committee and the Accountant to closely monitor the 
payment of monthly rentals of those accredited/recognized association who are 

still occupying the facilities to avoid accumulation of unpaid rents. 

 
Management’s Comment: 

 

In their letter-reply, Management explained that Professor Sotomil is not amenable 

to some provisions of the Housing Policy thus, he did not sign a single Housing Contract 

and pay rent ever since it was approved by the Board. Nevertheless, he continues to live in 

Clustered Apartment A. 



71 

 

 

Since 2007, his Proportional Vacation Pay, which requires clearance for release, 

was withheld by the College. It now accumulates to P49,993.62. Dialogues and mediations 

were also initiated however, Prof. Sotomil remains adamant. 

 

Last January 12, 2021, key personnel met with him to resolve this issue and 

proposed a convenient payment scheme. He did not agree to it but approves to pay his 

unclaimed PVP instead and commits to settle the remaining balance upon retirement. His 

payable is now reduced to P105,206.38.  

 

It was disclosed during the exit conference that a MOA has been prepared and that 

it was already signed by both the housing occupants and the College’s legal retainer in 

February 2021. Management hopes that this will improve collection efficiency on housing 

rentals. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

 Management’s actions on this matter are well taken and shall monitor its 

compliance. 

 

 

Non-renewal of Contracts of Housing Facilities 

 

6. The College Management did not enter into contracts and/or renew the Memoranda 
of Agreement between them and the new/old actual occupants of the housing facilities 

as required under the Board Resolution No. 48 s.2004, hence primarily affecting the 

collection efficiency for the internally generated funds which is the main source for 

the maintenance of the subject facilities. 

           

Item No. 4 of BOT Resolution No. 48, s. 2004 stipulates that: 

 

There shall be a contract between the College and the occupant. 

Failure of the occupant to sign the contract shall be a cause for 

eviction.  Any violations on the Board action on this matter shall be 

subjected to disciplinary action.  

          

Items 17 and 22 of the executed Contract of Lease dated December 15, 2014:  

 

17. That the lessee is allowed to stay for a period of two (2) years 

subject to the renewal of the policy contract. 

 

22. That this CONTRACT shall be good for one year without 
prejudice of re-application and to remain enforce form Jan. 3, 

2015 to Jan. 3, 2016 unless sooner revoked by the competent 

authority. 



72 

 

 

The Davao del Norte State College has owned buildings/housing units that can be 

assigned/leased to recognized organizations/qualified personnel as long as recommended 

by the Housing Committee. All DNSC Faculty and Staff and recognized organizations shall 

be considered applicants for the housing occupancy of units and college buildings. All 

qualified occupants shall have to enter into an agreement with the College as represented 

by the President. 

 

The BOT Resolution No. 48 took effect on November 1, 2004.  The College 

management then entered into an agreement between the actual occupants of the DNSC 

Housing facilities on December 15, 2014.  Since then, the DNSC management did not 

renew the executed MOA and failed to enter into an agreement with the new occupants 

until December 31,2020. 

  

In CY 2020, there were 23 actual occupants of the said College Housing Facilities 

that should have generated a total rental income of P126,720.00 during the year, however, 

this was not completely collected due to the following reasons: First, there were no 

contracts filed in the Housing Committee Office to prove that there were binding 

agreements between those actual occupants and the College.  Second, due to absence of 

contracts, the Accountant could not enforce to deduct from the occupants’ monthly payrolls 

the due and demandable rentals as required per the BOT Resolution No. 48.  In lieu of this, 

the Accountant sent demand letters/billing statements to those non-paying occupants. Most 

of them responded, while the others did not. 

  

According to the Accountant, the foregoing condition is a perennial problem which 

was not addressed by the past Presidents and the Housing Committee. It is her prayer that 

this will be resolved the soonest possible time by the new College Officials to prevent 

accumulation of the due and demandable rentals. 

  

The non-renewal and the non-entering into agreements by and between the 

representative of the College and the actual occupants of the Davao del Norte State College 

housing facilities as required under the Board Resolution No. 48, s.2004 have primarily 

affected the collection efficiency for the internally generated funds which is the main 

source for the maintenance of the subject facilities. 

 

Recommendation/s: 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. Require the Housing Committee to thoroughly instill in the minds of the new 
actual occupants that the housing facilities are established as support for the 

faculty and staff and that the meager rentals shall be collected as one of the 

main sources for the maintenance of the said facilities. A Memorandum of 

Agreement shall be executed by parties concerned before the occupants could 

use the facilities 
 



73 

 

b. Closely monitor the renewal of the Memoranda of Agreement for the old 
occupants to pave the way for efficient process of collections and the proper 

maintenance of the facilities as embodied in the duly notarized MOA where 

the first and the second parties’ responsibilities are enumerated; and 
 

c. Require also the Housing Committee to recommend to Management and for 
approval of the Board the provision of other vital features and measures 

necessary for the maintenance of the housing facilities being the government 

assets. 

 

Management’s Comment: 

 

In their letter-reply, it has been discussed that the College President reconstituted 

the housing committee by virtue of Special Order No. 13 dated October 22, 2020. The 

newly constituted Housing Committee drafted a new format of the MOA for housing 

occupants, which will take effect in CY 2021. One of the MOA agreements is the new 

rental rate which shall be collected through salary deduction and the validity period of the 

Contract. The said MOA was presented to the occupants during a meeting with the College 

President. 

 

Management informed that under the College’s land use and infrastructure plan, 

the proposed academic buildings and new housing for faculty and staff and student 

dormitories are part of the structures to be constructed in the housing units’ area. This plan 

is reinforced in the benefit-cost analysis of the Fact-Finding Committee, which stated that 

it is not advantageous for the College to retain the structures. Hence, the College has 

prepared the demolition plan until 2024 in which the Staff Cottages 1 and 4 and the 

Bunkhouse are scheduled for demolition to construct the GAD building and improvement 

of the hostel within this year. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

 Management’s comments are well noted. 

 

 

Maintenance of Housing Facilities 

 

7. The College hostel, housing units, as well as the canal and drainage of the college 
campus, were not properly maintained by the management and the actual occupants 

contrary to Section 105(1) of PD 1445 and Item 15 of the Policy, Rules and 

Regulations Governing Faculty and Staff Housing and Buildings of Davao del Norte 

State College, hence resulting in the major damages to some parts of the facilities and 

placing all the users to possible risks of the same. 

 

Section 105(1) of PD 1445. Measure of liability of accountable officers.  

 



74 

 

Every officer accountable for government property shall be liable 

for its money value in case of improper or unauthorized use or 

misapplication thereof, by himself or any person for whose acts he 

may be responsible. He shall likewise be liable for all losses, 

damages, or deterioration occasioned by negligence in the keeping 

or use of the property, whether or not it be at the time in his actual 

custody. 

            

Item 15 of the Policy, Rules and Regulations Governing Faculty and Staff Housing 

and Buildings of Davao del Norte State College which was approved on December 14, 

2004 stipulates: 

 

The lessee shall be responsible for the beautification, landscaping 

work, sanitation, minor repairs, maintenance and general upkeep of 

the leased buildings/housing units. 

 

 The Davao del Norte State College has owned a hostel, buildings/housing units that 

catered guests and assigned/leased to recognized organizations/qualified personnel. All 

DNSC Faculty and Staff and recognized organizations shall be considered applicants for 

the housing occupancy of the housing units and college buildings. 

 

  In CY 2020, there are 23 actual occupants/families in the College Housing 

Facilities aside from the come and go catered guests of the hostel every now and then. 

 

On August 17, 2020, the Audit Team made an ocular inspection together with the 

College President and the Accountant and observed the following deficiencies: 

 

1. HOSTEL - Landscaping was not properly maintained. Vine plants outside keep going 
inside the bathroom.  Roofing for more than two decades were not repainted. Most of 

the cabinets inside the rooms were damaged.  Some of the faucets/showers have 

malfunctioned. Curtains were not properly in placed.  Other amenities were not 

properly cleaned and sanitized.  

 

2. EXECUTIVE COTTAGE, CLUSTERED APARTMENTS, STAFF COTTAGES, 
DORMITORY, FISHERMEN’S DORMITORIES, CAFETERIA, TRAINING 

HALLS, AQUACULTURE BUILDING, BUNK HOUSE – Landscaping were not 

properly maintained by the occupants contrary to the approved policy, rules and 

regulations governing faculty and staff housing and buildings as mentioned above; 

roofing paints, gutters and ceiling were damaged and outmoded that needs to be 

repaired, cleanliness outside the housing units were not properly maintained and even 

washed clothes were displayed in front of some housing units.  

 

3. CANAL AND DRAINAGE – Stagnant water, unwanted plants/weeds have been 
growing in the area, thus inviting snakes and other harmful animals and insects to stay 

in.

THE DNSC CANAL & DRAINAGE 

 

All of the above pictures were taken during our actual ocular inspection of the 

college campus. 

 

According to the Finance Director, it has been almost three decades now and yet 

no major repairs were done to the subject units and buildings except for the installation of 

the street lights in the entire vicinity.  She added that the accumulated generated funds as 

of December 31, 2020 has reached to P1,197,421.98 awaiting for the DNSC officials of 

their plans and programs for the coming days ahead. 

 

Thus, for want of a better and safe place to stay-in, the College hostel and housing 

units are not the suitable places to live-in, because, aside from the places being untidy, the 

area became scary, unsafe and not suitable for occupancy.  The college management and 

the actual occupants should be made to answer for such a fiasco.  

 

Recommendation/s:    

 

We recommended that Management: 

 



78 

 

a. Require the Housing Committee to propose/introduce some necessary 
improvements/measures in the hostel and housing areas in order to have 

pleasing and clean places to visit and live for; 

 

b. Require the Housing Committee to closely monitor and regularly check if the 
role of both parties as stipulated in the MOA are being complied with and a 

written report shall be submitted to the management for proper action; 

 

c. To come up with a comprehensive plan for major repairs including repainting 
of roofing of all the subject buildings and housing units; and 

 

d. Prioritize the cleaning up of drainage and canals of the entire college campus 
for a clean and safe school environment. 

  

Management’s Comment:  

 

In their letter-reply, Management related that the College’s CY 2021 budget has 

allotted funds for the Completion and Renovation of College Hostel amounting to 

P15,000,000.00, Drainage Water and Electrical Systems Enhancement amounting to 

P15,000,000.00 and the hiring of personnel to man the hostel full-time with a budget of 

P142,211.52. Presently, these were under procurement process.  

  

Moreover, enhancements on the housing units were put on hold since the land 

where it is situated will be repurposed.  As per Strategic Plan, current housing units will be 

converted into buildings mainly for instructional use. The GAD and Wellness Complex 

and other projects are also in line in CY 2022-2024.
