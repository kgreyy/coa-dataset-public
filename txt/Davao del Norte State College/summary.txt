EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

 The Davao del Norte State College (DNSC) was created under Republic Act No. 

7879 which took effect on February 14, 1995. DNSC was formerly known as the Davao 

Regional Institute of Fisheries and Technology (DRIFT). The school campus’ facilities 

include administration building, staff houses, and laboratories of the training center of the 

Regional Fisheries Training Center (RFTC). The RFTC occupied the premises of the State 

College in 1986 through a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for twenty (25) years which 

expired last September 30, 2011 and vacated the said premises last July 2015. 
 

By virtue of Section 2 RA 7879 Charter of DNSC, it is mandated to primarily 

provide higher professional, technical and special instructions for special purpose and 

promote research and extension services, advanced studies and progressive leadership in 

education, engineering, arts and sciences, fisheries, and other fields that maybe relevant. 
 
 

B. Audit Methodology 
 

The Commission has been implementing risk-based audit in the conduct of its audit 

services. However, to meet the evolving developments in public governance and fund 

management, the results-based approach in audit was incorporated. The integration of these 

two approaches, called the Integrated Results and Risk-Based Audit (IRRBA) 

Methodology, was applied in the audit of the accounts and operations of the DNSC. 
 
 

C. Scope of Audit 
 

 The audit covered the review of accounts and operations of DNSC for CY 2020. 

The audit consisted of review of operating procedures, evaluation of the DNSC's programs 

and projects, interview of government officials and employees concerned, verification, 

reconciliation, analysis of accounts and such other procedures considered necessary.

The assets and equity of DNSC as at December 31, 2020 have increased materially 

as compared to last year’s balances, thus indicating a relatively stable and fair financial 

position as at year-end. The increase in assets can be attributed mainly to the escalating 

infrastructure projects of the College where the net property, plant and equipment have 

increased by P36,397,775.29. There was also a significant increase in revenue attributable 

to the increase in school fees by approximately 168.37%. On the other hand, the increase 

in liabilities can be attributed to the increase in trust liabilities and inter-agency payables.

E. Independent Auditor’s Report 
 

 The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements of the Davao del Norte State College for CY 2020 because of the 

exception noted in audit as discussed in detail in Part II of this Report as follows: 

  

a. The non-submission of the Report on the Physical Count of Property Plant and 
Equipment (RPCPPE) for Funds 101, 164, and 102 casts doubt on the accuracy, 



iii 
 

completeness and existence of the said PPE accounts in the amount of 

P272,696,411.05 as at year-end; and 

 

b. Unliquidated cash advances amounting to P70,742.24 resulted in a huge 
balance of Advances to Special Disbursing Officers account. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The significant audit observations and recommendations for the year 2020, which 

were duly discussed with DNSC officials concerned last February 24, 2021 are summarized 

as follows: 
 

1. The non-submission of the Report on the Physical Count of Property Plant 
and Equipment (RPCPPE) for Funds 101, 164, and 102 contravened Section 

38 Chapter 10 of GAM, thus casting doubt on the accuracy, completeness and 

existence of the said PPE accounts in the amount of P272,696,411.05 as at year-

end as the balances could not be relied upon. 

 

2. Delivered properties and equipment costing P184,940.00 were not recorded in 

the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Cards (PPELC), hence, the 

balance of PPE and its related accounts in the financial statements is 

understated by the same amount. 

We recommended that Management direct the Property/Supply Officer and 

members of the Inventory Committee to submit the lacking RPCPPE within 5 days 

from receipt hereof and strictly observe the prescribed deadline in the submission 

thereof in accordance with the existing laws, rules, and regulations. Otherwise, cause 

the suspension of payment of salaries of personnel concerned until they shall have 

complied with the requirements of the Commission. 

 

3. Cash Advances totaling P70,742.24 remained unliquidated as at December 31, 
2020 contrary to the pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated 

February 10, 1997 and P.D. No. 1445, hence resulting in a huge balance of 

Advances to Special Disbursing Officers account and exposing government 

funds to possible loss or misuse and/or misappropriation. 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. Ensure that cash advances shall be liquidated in accordance with the 
provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. The officials 

and employees concerned shall effect immediate settlement of the same 

otherwise, the necessary sanctions for their non-settlement such as the 

withholding of the salary be applied; and 

 



iv 
 

b. Avoid simultaneous granting of cash advances to Accountable Officers who 
still have outstanding or unliquidated balances so as to prevent accumulation 

of cash advances pursuant to Section 89 of P.D. No. 1445 and COA Circular 

No. 97-002.
