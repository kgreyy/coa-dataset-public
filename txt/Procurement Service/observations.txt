  OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

Financial Audit 

 

Accounting errors/omissions 
 
1. Various accounting errors/omissions affected the fair presentation of the 

reported balances of the accounts in the financial statements (FSs).  

 

Section 15, Chapter 2, Volume I of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) 
for National Government Agencies (NGAs) states that the financial statements (FSs) 
shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an 
entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of 
transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 
recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out in Philippine 
Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS), now International Public Sector 
Accounting Standards (IPSAS) pursuant to COA Resolution No. 2020-001 dated 
January 9, 2020. 

 
Moreover, existing regulation requires that the accounts of the agency be kept 

in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be 
adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the 
government.1 

 
The audit of accounts and transactions of the Procurement Service (PS)-Main, 

including the transactions of the Regional Depots (RDs) and Sub-Depots (SDs), 
disclosed various errors and omissions which affected the fair presentation of the 
reported total Assets, Liabilities and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) in the FSs, as 
discussed in Table 1.

Charge (OIC)-Chief Accountant to: (a) effect the necessary adjustments to 

correct the reported balances of the affected accounts in the FSs; and, (b) 

henceforth, observe the proper/correct recognition of transactions in 

accordance with the GAM for NGAs and other applicable accounting rules and 

regulations. 

 
 

Accounting Deficiencies 
 
2. The completeness, accuracy, and existence of several assets and liabilities could 

not be readily ascertained due to variances between books and related records 

and non-compliance with accounting policies, guidelines and procedures, and 

agreements, among others. 

 
Section 6, Paragraph (e), Chapter 19, Volume I of GAM for NGAs on 

Qualitative Characteristics of Financial Reporting states that an entity shall present 



38  

information including accounting policies in a manner that meets reliable information 
which is free from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to 
represent faithfully that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be 
expected to represent. 

 

  Analysis of the accounts and transactions of the PS Main and its RDs revealed 
various deficiencies that have an impact on the fair presentation of the assets, 
liabilities and net assets/equity, as summarized in Table 2.

a. Deficiencies in accounting controls over collection of receivables 
 

 Absence of periodic billings for Service Fees 
 

Verification of the Service Income through Recommendation to Award 
(RTA) revealed that out of the total receivable of P2.768 billion from CYs 2017 - 
2020, the amount of P1.080 billion or 39 per cent was collected leaving a balance 
of P1.688 billion. The statement of billing was sent out only once, and no regular 
billings were made or action to follow-up the outstanding balances of various 
agencies.  The PS just wait for the agencies to pay them for the services rendered.  
The composition of the client-agencies with uncollected service income, that had 
availed the services of the PS from CYs 2017-2020 through RTA are shown in 
Table 3.

 Weak control over GFA Transactions 

 
It was observed that the PS has weak control over the GFA transactions. The 

controls to detect sufficiency of advance payments by client-agencies to cover 
bookings for travel and to require replenishment when the advance payment reached 
50 per cent utilization were not embedded in the portal system. The procedures were 
not undertaken for lack of manpower to monitor GFA balances and the credit lines 
with the airlines. The implementation of GFA with weak control on its system 
exposes the PS the risk of non-collections of the balances from concerned agencies, 
thereby depleting the agency of the funds for its other operational needs. 

 
Review of the account showed that out of P51.908 million total outstanding 

balance of the client-agencies in CY 2019, the amount of P6.473 million or 12.47 per 
cent was only collected in CY 2020 despite issuance of demand letters. The balance 
of P45.435 million was still uncollected as at December 31, 2020.  



40  

 Lack of monitoring of dishonored checks 
 
Various checks issued by the client-agencies amounting to P11.871 million 

for the payment of supplies and equipment were dishonored or returned by bank due 
to several reasons, such as, discrepancies from advice, payee, date and serial number, 
no advise on file, drawn against insufficient funds, lack of signatures and account 
under garnishment. The RDs sent collection notices to inform agencies on the 
dishonored checks. In PS-Main, the collecting officer stated that the agencies 
concerned were only verbally informed of their dishonored checks. 

 

Out of P13.673 million recognized in CYs 2017 - 2020 as dishonored checks, 
P11.871 million or 86.82 per cent, were not yet issued with replacement checks. 
Yearly, the PS has encountered problems on dishonored checks from client NGAs 
and Local Government Units (LGUs). Table 4 shows the breakdown of dishonored 
checks for replacement as at December 31, 2020.

 Double delivery of supplies to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) 

 
The over-delivery of supplies amounting to P1.267 million pertains to the 

issued billing statement to DBM on September 7, 2016 due to error in the assignment 
of control number to the Agency Procurement Request (APR) which resulted in two 
deliveries. The Audit Team noted that no action was done by the Management to 
collect the said amount, and PS did not even deduct the said amount to the existing 
balance of the DBM account with PS. 

 
 Unidentified receivable balances from prior years 

 
The balance of P474,415.60 showed that there were still unidentified prior 

years’ balances based on the schedule submitted by the OIC-Chief Accountant. 
Inquiry with the OIC-Chief Accountant revealed that the breakdown of the balance 
could no longer be traced because of lack of data.   

 
We recommended and Management agreed to require the OIC-Chief 

Accountant to: (a) send out periodic Statement of Accounts to debtor-client 

agencies, informing them the nature and the amount of their 

accounts/obligations; (b) deduct the cost of over-delivered items to the existing 

balance of DBM in the books of the PS; (c) exert extra effort to identify 



41  

P474,415.60 prior years balances and make necessary adjustments or request 

for write-off the unidentified dormant receivables. 
 

b. Deficiency in accounting controls for unidentified deposits resulting in idle funds 
 
Under the PS’s mandate2, the client-agencies are required to remit in advance 

the costs of their requirements for supplies, materials, and equipment. The Audit Team 
discovered, upon examination of the bank records that some client-agencies made 
bank transfer directly to the PS’ Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) bank account 
without submitting the accomplished APR. The PS-PhilGEPS has not yet developed 
an operating system where client-agencies can transact with the PS online. When 
these advance payments are received by PS without corresponding APR, the PS could 
not identify the client-agency that transferred the funds, and these advance payments 
will remain in the bank account of the PS until and when the client-agency submits an 
accomplished APR and proof of payment. It was further observed by the Audit Team 
that the high increase of deposits with unidentified client-agencies usually happens 
before the end of the year, presumably, these agencies are avoiding reversion of their 
excess funds to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr).  

 
Inquiry with the Management revealed that the client-agencies usually make 

direct transfers to the PS bank account without informing the PS and have not 
submitted accomplished APR that lead to accumulation of idle and unprocessed funds 
throughout the years from CYs 2004 to 2019 amounting to P117.701 million as at 
December 31, 2020 and has remained unreverted to the BTr.

42  

We recommended that Management instruct the: 

 

a)   OIC-Chief Accountant to: (i) remit to the BTr the accumulated 
idle/unidentified deposits from CYs 2004 to 2019 amounting to 

P117.701 million; and (ii) monitor the deposits made in the current 

year to the PS without corresponding APR, and remit the same if 

warranted; and, 

 

b)   Director, Operations Group (OG) to establish a policy that will 
identify all the deposits made by the client agencies, such as, 

coordination with the LBP to require depositors-client agencies to 

submit copy of APR duly acknowledged by the PS, and other 

control mechanism, in order to stop the practice of the client-

agencies of depositing their funds to the PS without the 

corresponding APR. 
 

c. Discrepancies of PPE balances between the books of accounts and RPCPPE  
 

Comparison of the PPE account balances per books against the RPCPPE as at 
December 31, 2020 disclosed a net discrepancy of P1.071 million with details shown 
in Table 6.

Review of available documents relative to PPE accounts disclosed that some 
of the discrepancies can be attributed to the following: 

 
 Various PPE recognized in the books but not reported in the RPCPPE 

totaling P30.545 million; 
 Various PPE reported in the RPCPPE but not recognized in the books 

totaling P18.594 million; 
 PPE reported twice in the RPCPPE totalling P0.954 million; 



43  

 Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Equipment 
reclassified to subscription expense totaling P4.275 million, still recorded 
in the RPCPPE; 

 Discrepancies in the amounts reflected per books and per RPCPPE of 
various PPE amounting to P77,380.27; 

 PPE found in the station but not reported in RPCPPE amounting to P1.559 
million; and 

 The unit values of 65 PPE items were not indicated in the RPCPPE. 
 
Analysis of the reconciling items disclosed the causes of the discrepancies 

which include, among others, the following: 

a. The Comptroller Division (CD) has not maintained PPE Ledger Cards 
(PPELCs) for each category of the PPE.  The PPELCs were only 
prepared for the CY 2020 and partially prepared for CY 2019 
transactions. The CD still uses PPE database to support the General 
Ledger (GL) balances of the PPE.  Comparison of the amounts between 
the GLs and the PPE Database revealed a difference of (P0.749 million), 
as presented in Table 7.

Total 68,162,006.32 68,911,491.53 (749,485.21) 

 
The information on the database were incomplete and discrepancies were 
noted in some accounts, hence the integrity of the report could not be 
ascertained. Correct information of the PPE is necessary in the 
reconciliation of records/reports between the General Services Division 
(GSD)/Property Unit and the CD; and 

 
b. The Property Officer has prepared Property Cards (PCs) for CY 2020 and 

partially prepared for CYs 2012–2019. The PCs were lacking of some 
information, such as, proper description of PPE, serial number, size, 
brand, amount and additional information on the “Remarks” column, 
necessary to identify the specific PPE in order to facilitate reconciliation 
of records between the CD and GSD/Property Unit. 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

 

a) The OIC-Chief Accountant to prepare/ maintain PPELC  for each 
category of PPE and improve the description of the PPE items and 

record all acquisitions and disposition of the PPE in the PPELC in 



44  

order to facilitate the reconciliation of records with the 

GSD/Property Unit; 

 

b) The OIC-GSD/Property Officer to properly maintain, regularly 
update and periodically reconcile the PCs with the RPCPPE. Any 

discrepancies noted should be immediately verified and adjusted; 

and 

 

c) The OIC-GSD/Property Officer and the OIC-Chief Accountant to 
review and analyze the discrepancy between their records and effect 

the necessary adjustments. 
 

c. Non-disposal of unserviceable PPE 
 

The non-disposal of the unserviceable properties resulted in PPE to be 
continuously recognized in the books although these PPE were without future 
economic benefit or service potential. Table 8 shows the unserviceable PPE identified 
in the RDs.

Total 247,918.89     357,365.07 605,283.96 

 
The delay/non-disposal and continuous keeping of the unserviceable property 

expose the assets to further deterioration and gradually diminishing their value due to 
obsolescence and wear and tear, and the possible loss of income that maybe derived 
from sale of the assets. This circumstance is an indication of the RDs’s inadequate 
internal control in the custody and administration of government property. 

 
We recommended that Management in RDs I, III, V and XIII to direct 

the:  (a) RD Property Officer to prepare the Inventory and Inspection Report of 

Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) to report all property and equipment found 

unserviceable, obsolete and/or no longer needed; and (b) RD Property Officer 

and other concerned employees to undertake the expeditious disposal of all 

unserviceable property of the RD through an appropriate mode of disposal 

deemed most advantageous to the government.

Property and equipment amounting to P2.088 million were inadvertently not 
included in the inventory taking and in the RPCPPE as at December 31, 2020 as 
verified by the Depot Accountant and Depot Supply/Property Officer and reconciled 
with the available records.  These pertain to the property and equipment procured 



45  

during CYs 2015 to 2018 charged against the profit share received by the RD, which 
were issued to its personnel and to the support staff from DBM Regional Office XIII. 

 
As explained by Management in the previous year’s audit, the guidelines 

provided in PS unnumbered memorandum dated February 4, 2013 did not expressly 
specify the instructions on how to treat assets procured out of the income share, thus 
these were not included in the inventory report.  Considering that these PPEs are 
procured through public funds, it is necessary for the RD to establish the existence 
and accountability of these assets.  

 
For CY 2020, RD XIII Inventory Committee conducted physical count of the 

RD’s property and equipment, including semi-expandable property, on January 21, 
2021.  The result of the said inventory taking was presented in the RPCPPE as at 
December 31, 2020, comprised of the PPE presented in Table 9. 

 
        Table 9.  Property and equipment as at December 31, 2020

Office Equipment    208,325.00  
Semi-expendable Property    966,227.60  
Total 3,073,412.60  

 
During the physical count and in the review of the inventory report submitted 

to the Audit Team on February 4, 2021, it was observed that 11 units of ICT 
Equipment and 19 units of semi-expendable property with a total acquisition cost of 
P498,710.00 were not found at station and were labelled “For retrieval” under the 
Remarks column of the RPCPPE.  The non-existing/missing items were part of the 
property and equipment which were not included in the inventory taking and in the 
RPCPPE as at December 31, 2019.  Most of the items not found at station during the 
physical count pertain to laptops, tables and cellular phones issued to personnel no 
longer connected with the RD or the DBM Regional Office XIII. The details are 
presented in Table 10.

We recommended that Management in RD XIII to:   

 

a) Inquire with the CD of PS-Main on the proper treatment of the 
property and equipment charged against the profit share; 

   

b) Prepare letters demanding the production of the PPE addressed to the 
concerned accountable officers who were issued with the items 

considered as missing during the physical count; 

   

c) Direct the RD Accountant to reiterate the RD’s request to the CD of 
PS-Main for copy of the PPELC and other pertinent documents and 

reconcile these against the updated property records maintained by 

the Depot Property Officer; 

 

d) Analyze and identify the causes of the discrepancies for necessary 
adjustments in the records and furnish the OIC-Chief Accountant of 

PS-Main the results of the reconciliation conducted for the 

adjustments in the books of accounts; and 

 

e) Require the Inventory Committee to appropriately report the physical 
count of semi-expendable property covered by Inventory Custodian 

Slip (ICS) in the RPCI. 

    

 

Compliance Issues 

 

Unutilized and dormant advances from client-agencies  
 
3. Inter-agency transferred funds and Other Payables totaling P10.870 billion 

pertaining to advances for CSE which remained undelivered/unutilized and 

dormant for years were still not remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury, thus, 

depriving the government the use of funds in the implementation of its 

project/programs. 

 

The PS is mandated to be the central procurement system for the purpose of 
procuring CSE and materials for the use of the national government and its agencies 
and instrumentalities.3 It also serves as a procurement agent by choice of most 
government agencies for the procurement of non-common-use supplies and 
equipment (NCSE) including airline tickets. 

 
Client-agencies remit in advance to PS the funds needed to service their 

requirements for the supplies, materials and equipment based on their Work and 
Financial Plan and APR.

Each government agency has received yearly appropriation for the allocation 
of needed supplies and materials, hence, unused or excess fund should be reverted 
back to the BTr. 

   
Review of the submitted schedule and aging of various agencies with P1  

million and above net balances of Inter-Agency Transferred funds as at December 31, 
2020, showed that of the total Inter-Agency Transferred funds of P31.567 billion, the 
amount of P10.864 billion had ages two or more years and remained unremitted to the 
BTr, as summarized in Table 11.

Inquiry with the OIC-Chief Accountant on the reconciliation of balances of 
various agencies confirmed that only agencies who have requests for refund and have 
reconciled balances with PS, were processed for the refund of their unutilized 
balances. 
 

For CY 2020, P157.015 million were refunded to 57 client-agencies and 
P1.209 billion identified balances of 155 client-agencies were allocated to the cash 
sweep made by the BTr as instructed by the DBM in support to the National 
Government under RA No. 11469, or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.  
 

Moreover, review of Other Payables at year-end revealed that the balance of 
P5.957 million has been dormant since CY 2011. This amount pertains to deposits 
made by client-agencies to the PS bank account under LBP Current Account that 
could not be identified by the PS for lack of information. These agencies did not even 
bother to inform the PS of the deposits they made.  Similarly, the LBP has no records 
of the agencies who made the deposits. Almost a decade has lapsed, yet no client-
agencies had validly claimed their deposits to the PS. 

 
The non-remittance of the total advances of P10.870 billion (P10.864 billion + 

P5.957 million) representing unutilized or undelivered CSEs and unidentified 
depositors, in the books, deprived the government of the use of funds in the 
implementation of its project/programs. 

 
We recommended and Management agreed to direct the OIC-Chief 

Accountant to:  (a) remit to the BTr the amount of P10.870 billion, advances 

from client-agencies representing unused/unutilized advances and deposits 



48  

made by unknown client-agencies for several years now; and (b) inform the 

client-agencies of the remittance of P10.864 billion made to the BTr so that 

proper adjustments will be made in the client agencies’ respective books of 

accounts.     

  

 
Non-disposal of spoiled and expired CSE items of RDs III, V, XI, and XIII 
 
4. Several expired, non-moving and obsolete inventories in RDs III, V, XI and XIII 

restricted the use of the depots’ storage space for other useful purposes and 

prolonged the exposure of the said inventories and properties to damage and 

further deterioration which could diminish their resale/scrap values which is not 

in accordance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445 and Section 40 (d), Chapter 10, 

Volume I of GAM for NGAs. 
 
Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides that when government property has 

become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application 
of the officer accountable, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly 
authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be 
valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence.  
 

Moreover, Section 40 (d), Chapter 10 Volume I of GAM for NGAs states that 
all unserviceable property shall be reported in the IIRUP, which is in Appendix 74.  
 

During the physical inventory-taking procedures conducted for CY 2020 in 
RD III, it was observed that obsolete inventory items totaling P59,045.02 were still 
not disposed of as at December 31, 2020. Similarly, in RD V, expired inventory items 
of P22,280.00 remained in the depot warehouse waiting for transfer to other depots or 
to PS-Main for proper disposition. 

 
In RD XI, most of the items that were obsolete, expired and non-moving are 

ICT consumables that were already phased out in the market. These items were 
already reported at the PS-Main through the submission of IIRUP. 

 
In RD XIII, the CSE amounting to P472,648.22 which were already disposed 

by the depot on January 31, 2020 were not yet derecognized in the FACT System.  
Review of documents submitted by the depot disclosed that the pertinent documents 
relative to the disposal were forwarded to the PS-Main on February 26, 2020 as bases 
for dropping the disposed items in the FACT system and for the derecognition of said 
CSE in the books of accounts. The RD Management reiterated its request from the 
Regional Operations Group (ROG) on September 26, 2020 for the deletion/dropping 
of the disposed CSE items.  However, as at December 31, 2020, the disposed 
inventories were still reflected in the Report of Stock Position and in the In/Out 
Register-Product Wise-Summary generated by the Depot Supply Officer from the 
FACT system.  It was also noted that some of the disposed items were still not 
adjusted in the bin cards. 

 



49  

We recommended that Management in:  

 

a) RDs III, V and XI to: (i) instruct the Depot Supply and Property Officer to 
prepare the corresponding IIRUP for CY 2020; and (ii)  exert extra efforts to 

obtain the approval from the PS-Main and cause the immediate disposal of 

all the obsolete inventories and unserviceable properties either by 

destruction, donation or sale; and, 

 

b) RD XIII to:(i)  inquire with the PS-Main on the status of the Depot’s request 
for the dropping of the disposed CSE in the FACT system to ensure 

correctness of the balance of the inventory items; and  (ii)  direct the 

Storekeeper of RD XIII to update the bin cards based on the result of the 

physical count and appropriately deduct from the balance the quantity of 

some inventory items that were already disposed of. 

 

 

Unserved APRs 
 

5. CSE items were frequently out-of-stock caused by lack of effective inventory 
management system, which resulted in unserved APRs and consequently in the 

loss of sales estimated at P360.861 million to the agency. 

 
Review of APRs disclosed that there were unserved or without deliveries to 

client-agencies as at December 31, 2020. The following were determined to be the 
causes of the unserved APRs: 

 
a. Lack of an effective Inventory Management System 

  
The PS as central procurement of CSE for the use of the national government 

and its agencies and instrumentalities shall strengthen its operations and shall 
undertake on a regular basis the improvement of inventory management by 
developing a computerized system to manage inventories, with the primary objective 
of determining and controlling stock levels within the physical distribution function 
to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock 
holding and handling costs.4 

 
Review of the weekly individual inventory reports from the Warehousing and 

Delivery Division (WADD) on the stocks of the 308 items listed as CSE in the PS 
website revealed that an average of 96 item of stocks or 30 per cent were not 
available per month, as shown in Table 12.

Validation of the reports from PhilGEPS and the submitted contracts to the 

Audit Team, disclosed that only few CSE items were procured. The summary is 
presented in Table 13.

243 44 199 

 
Out of 44 items scheduled for bidding, 35 items were bid out and 

successfully awarded while the bidding for the remaining nine items had failed as 
there were no suppliers participated in the biddings. Thus, a total of 208 out of stocks 
items were not procured as at year-end. 

 
The Audit Team noted that PS has no clear-cut policy on the re-order point 

system.  There is no certain minimum quantity or re-order point for each inventory 
items. Only when the level of the inventory items become critical due to significant 
depletion that the WADD prepares Demand and Replenishment Form (DRF) and 
submit it to the concerned Procurement Divisions (PDs).  

 
Moreover, the procurement for the CSEs is still at the discretion of the 

Procurement Group (PG) and it starts upon the submission of the consolidated APP-
CSE by the Marketing and Sales Division (MSD) and not the DRF submitted to the 
PG by the WADD. 

 
Managing of inventories to ensure stock availability could not be achieved 

due to the absence of re-order point policy.  Problems on lead time on the 
procurement, as well as delivery time of the suppliers add to the problem of out of 
stock inventories. 

 



51  

On December 9, 2020, the PS issued Office Order No. 171-20 for the 
creation of PS Reorder Point Policy Committee to establish a reorder point policy. To 
date, there still no Reorder Point Policy formulated to minimize the frequent out-of-
stock status of CSE items. 

 
Delivery of CSE items to client-agencies prompts the recognition of Sales 

Revenue. A sound inventory system of maintaining stocks held for sale, will result in 
higher rate of processing APRs and delivery to client-agencies of their needed 
supplies, hence, will result in increased income of the PS.  For CY 2020, an estimated 
sales revenue of P360.861 million could have been earned based on the unserved 
APRs submitted by the MSD from walk-in clients alone, which were not served as 
the requested CSE items were out-of-stock.  These CSE items were basic supplies, 
such as, computer inks, multi-purpose papers, sign pens, and note pads, among others, 
needed by the client-agencies in their daily operations. 

 
Analysis of the PS’ supply/delivery performance for CY 2020 disclosed that 

out of P37.569 billion targeted sales revenue, only P21.204 billion or 56.44 per cent 
was recognized, showing that the targeted sales fell short by P16.365 billion or 43.56 
per cent. 

 
We recommended and Management agreed to require the:  

 

a) Chairperson of the Reorder Point Policy Committee to: (i) establish 
the Reorder Point Policy in coordination with concerned divisions; 

and, (ii) regularly evaluate the compliance with the Reorder Point 

Policy by WADD and PG, once established; 

 

b) Chief, WADD to monitor the level of CSE and notify the PG when the 
CSE items reach the reorder point determined by the Committee; 

and 

 

c) Head, PG to procure immediately the CSE items upon receipt of 
notification from WADD. 

 
 

b. Delayed deliveries of inventories to RD XI 
 

The 2019 PS-PhilGEPS Depot Operations Manual provides that it is the 
responsibility of PS-Main to transfer stock quantities to the depots in accordance with 
the available stocks to supply the requirement of government agencies in the regions, 
provinces and cities based on the submitted APP, or based on the Stock Transfer 
Request (STR).  

 
RD XI submits to PS-Main a STR based on the APRs of the agencies. The 

STRs prepared by RD XI are mostly fast moving and are basically needed in the 



52  

operations of the client-agencies. However, not all items indicated in the STRs were 
transferred by PS-Main. 

 
The depots are dependent on the Transfer of Stocks (TOS) from the PS-Main 

which includes freight cost with a total value of P3.189 million. The freight cost is 
intended to cover the cost of shipping of stocks to the region where items like bond 
papers, plastic chairs, etc. are distributed.  

 
Analysis of the STRs and the TOS revealed that out of STRs amounting to 

P182.672 million, only P28.967 million or 15.73 per cent was served by PS-Main to 
RD XI. Moreover, out of the P28.967 million STRs served, the amount of P3.190 
million was not requested or over served, which contributed to the year-end inventory 
balance of P0.634 million. 

 
There were 9,623 APRs received by RD XI in CY 2020 and only 2,289 

deliveries were made due to unavailable stocks. As such, 7,334 Certificates of Non-
availability of Stocks were issued to client-agencies for them to procure the 
unavailable stocks from the local market, thus caused delays in the implementation of 
the client-agencies’ activities. 

 
Having an adequate and right supplies at the depots, RD XI will increase its 

sales and serve the purpose of its mandated functions. 
 
We recommended and Management in RD XI agreed to: (a) look into the 

available stocks in the PS-Main before making request;  (b) monitor the TOS to 

be shipped by PS-Main  in accordance with the request of the region in order to 

avoid unnecessary deliveries; (c) intensify coordination with PS-Main for the 

immediate delivery of items requested; and, (d) direct the RD’s personnel to 

revisit the PS-PhilGEPS Depot operations manual for guidance in improving 

depot inventory management. 

 
 

Weak control over inventories 
 

6. Absence of clear policy on handling inventories manifested by poor coordination 
among operating offices of the agency resulted in slow-moving COVID-19 items 

totaling P95.455 million.  
 

Section 6 of Administrative Order (AO) No. 17 dated July 28, 2011, requires 
the PS to strengthen its operations in service delivery and regularly conduct price 
monitoring of CSE for the purpose of benchmarking prices against the market. 
Inventory management should also be improved with the primary objective of 
determining and controlling stock levels within the physical distribution function to 
balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock 
holding and handling costs. 

 



53  

The following are the three PS’ divisions/group who have control over the 
movement of inventories: (a) WADD is in charge of inventory management and 
delivery forwarding services; (b) MSD is responsible for formulation of marketing 
strategy, market research and management of clients; and, (c) ROG is responsible for 
sales, marketing, inventory, planning and management, distribution, warehousing and 
logistics in the regions. 

 
In CY 2020, due to the rising questions from client-agencies on the PS’ selling 

prices of surgical face masks and face shields, the Audit Team analyzed the selling 
prices of the items. Review of transactions disclosed that during the onset of the 
outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the demand of surgical face masks 
was so high that scarcity of supply raised the price. Such scarcity prompted PS to resort 
to procure surgical face masks and face shields in bulk orders. The RDs’ client-
agencies also pre-ordered and were included in the bulk orders. 

 
Face masks and other medical devices are within the purview of Department 

of Health (DOH).  In March 2020, through DOH Department Circular No. 2020-0142, 
the suggested retail price (SRP) of face masks was as high as P28.00. For face shield, 
price quotations of the local traders was P120.00 per piece. The cost of P28.00 and 
P120.00 per piece was used by PS in market surveys for its negotiated procurements.  
The cost per piece in the Purchase Orders (POs) for surgical masks ranged from 
P13.50 to P27.72, as presented in Table 14.

Table 14 shows that PS entered into contracts in bulk orders for the supply 

and delivery of 113.950 million pieces of surgical masks and 1.317 million pieces of 
face shields in a span of one to two months time when the price in the market was so 
high. Items were delivered to PS Main, at the earliest, in May 2020. 

 
RD XI ordered from the PS-Main early but received its share in the surgical masks 

and face shields for sale when the selling prices in the local market already dropped.  
Several RDs sent letters through the ROG, inquiring on the permitted discounts in 
order to sell at a reduced cost. However, it was reported that no reply was received by 
them. 



54  

Upon request, DOH furnished the Audit Team a copy of DOH Department 
Memorandum (DM) No. 2020-0413 dated September 9, 2020 showing the updated 
SRPs. The SRPs indicated in the said DOH DM were used as a benchmark to the 
market prices as of December 31, 2020. Table 15 shows the comparison of PS selling 
price and DOH SRP for surgical mask and face shields.  

 
Table 15.  Comparison of Selling Prices of Surgical Mask and Face Shield

Face Shield 124.80 26.00 to 50.00 74.80 to 98.80 

 
As presented in Table 15, there is a wide gap between the PS selling prices 

and DOH SRPs. As a result, surgical face masks and face shields are now slow-
moving items in the warehouses of the RDs. As reported by the Audit Team of RD XI, 
many client-agencies opted not to purchase from PS due to the high selling prices of 
the items. 

 
The number of pieces available and cost at year-end were drawn from the 

RPCI of PS-Main and various RDs as at December 31, 2020 showed the cost 
amounting to P95.456 million, as shown in Table 16.

If PS had delivered all of the items when the demand was high, these items 

could have been sold immediately at a selling price at par in the market in the total 
amount of P99.274 million. It was only in September 2020 that DOH implemented 
the updated SRPs. From May 2020 to September 2020, the PS had the opportunity to 
sell items at par in the market, yet these items remained unsold at the end of the year. 
More than the income generated, the PS could have served fellow government 
employees/healthcare workers through the delivery and sale of these items during the 
time these were badly/urgently needed.  

 
The surgical masks have expiry date as per inspection, thus these items should 

be backed up with marketing strategies to ensure salability before expiration. 
Ideally, inventories should not take more than a year to be delivered/sold. In 
September 2020, surgical masks and face shields were included as CSE items for PS 
to procure. This means that PS will eventually procure these items to replenish stocks. 
However, PS is not yet equipped with clear policy that would lay down timelines of 



55  

marketing and sales strategies that will minimize the risk of the items arriving at 
expiry dates.  

 
Walkthrough of the process of inventory management vis-a-vis formulation of 

marketing strategy and regional operations showed that the PS does not have a policy 
that could strengthen the coordination within the group. The WADD identifies in-
stock classification as fast, moderate or slow-moving. However, upon inquiry 
regarding the parameters thereof, WADD was not able to provide distinctions. 

 
Further inquiry was made as to what marketing strategies are in place by MSD 

to ensure salability of CSE items in the event slow-moving or non-moving items were 
identified by WADD. The MSD raised the marketing strategies such as posting items 
in the agency website as “Items for Sale”, promotions such as sale in a bundle and at 
a discounted price. However, each identified stock classification does not have a 
distinct/specific backup marketing strategy. 

 
Interview statements of MSD also revealed the absence of policy in place to 

clearly execute the range of discount the PS may offer, and has not monitored the 
fluctuation of selling prices in the market. Price monitoring is only conducted by PS 
during the purchase of CSE items through market surveys. 

 
We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned 

heads of groups/divisions: 

 

a) Director, OG to: (i) spearhead the establishment of a clear policy laying 
down marketing or sales strategy timelines that would minimize stock 

handling of moderate to slow-moving items and identify the responsibilities 

and accountabilities of the different operating offices/divisions; (ii) secure 

relative historical data from WADD, MSD and Depot Operations Division 
(DOD) to aid in policymaking; and (iii) regularly evaluate the 
performance/accomplishment of WADD, MSD and DOD, once established; 

 

b) Chief, WADD to monitor and report to MSD upon identifying the 
classification of inventory items; 

 

c) Chief, MSD to: (i) coordinate with WADD on the classification of critical 
inventory items; and (ii) devise marketing or sales strategy that would 

effectively speed up the sale of the surgical mask and face shield and other 

slow moving items identified by WADD;  and 

 

d) Chief, DOD to coordinate with MSD, WADD and ROG for marketing and 
sales strategies in each classification of the inventory items in the RDs.

Non-observance of proper procedures in the conduct of inventory of PPE 
 

7. Non-adherence to the proper procedures in the conduct of physical count of 
PPEs resulted in: (a) unreliable information on its assets; (b) non-establishment 

of proper accountability over its PPE; (c) incomplete submission of required 

reports; and (d) discrepancies in the property and accounting records and 

reports. 

 

COA Circular 2020-06 dated January 11, 2020 provides the Guidelines and 
Procedures in the Conduct of Physical Count of PPE, Recognition of PPE Items 
Found at Station, and Disposition for Non-existing/Missing PPE Items, for the One-
Time Cleansing of PPE Account Balances of Government Agencies.  

 
Moreover, Section 38 of Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM for NGAs requires that 

equipment found at the station and losses discovered during the physical count shall 
be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording. 

 
PS Office Order No. 175-20 dated December 18, 2020 was issued creating the 

Inventory Committee for the physical inventory taking of PPE for the Main Office, 
which composed of 17 employees, including at least one member each from the 
Comptroller and Property Divisions of the agency. The Inventory Committee 
conducted physical count of all its PPE on December 21, 2020 to January 8, 2021. 
The RPCPPE was submitted to this Office on January 27, 2021.  

 
Although the PS has complied with the requirement of the conduct of annual 

physical inventory taking, it was not able to properly conduct the actual inventory 
taking, which aims to establish PPE balances that are verifiable as to existence, 
condition and accountability.  The Audit Team has observed the following 
deficiencies in the conduct of the physical inventory taking of PPEs, among others: 

 
 The physical count was not recorded in a standard Inventory Count Form 

as the basis in the preparation of the RPCPPE after the physical count;  
 The PS did not adopt a uniform property identification system for PPE 

wherein a unique Property Number shall be assigned for each PPE item, 
using the numbering system; 

 Some property stickers also lacked vital information on the PPE items, and  
some markings on  the property stickers were already faded and 
unreadable;  

 The Property Unit did not reconcile the PCs maintained with the PPELCs 
maintained by the Accounting Unit; and 

 The GSD/Property Unit did not prepare the following:  
- List of PPEs Found at Station for those items described as "found at 

station" in the RPCPPE, to be submitted to the CD for recording in the 
books of accounts; 

- List of Non-Existing/Missing PPEs for items described as "non-
existing" or "missing" in the RPCPPE; and 



57  

- IIRUP for all PPEs found unserviceable, obsolete and/or no longer 
needed. 

 

The non-observance of the proper procedures in the conduct of physical count 
of PPEs by the PS-Main resulted in: (i) unreliable information on its assets; (ii) non-
establishment of proper accountability over its PPE; (iii) non/incomplete submission 
of required reports; and (d) discrepancies in the property and accounting records and 
reports.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned 

personnel when conducting physical inventory of PPE to undertake the 

following: 

 

a) Head, Inventory Committee to plan/strategize on how to conduct and 
complete the physical inventory within the prescribed period and prepare the 

necessary reports; 

 

b) OIC-Chief Accountant to: (i) take up the necessary adjusting entries to 
recognize PPEs found at station and loss of PPE; and (ii) ensure that the total 

balance of PPELCs tallies with the total balance of controlling PPE accounts 

in the GL; and,  
 

c) OIC-GSD/Property Officer to: (i) prepare a List of PPEs Found at Station 
and List of Non-Existing/Missing PPEs for items described as "non-existing" 

or "missing" in the RPCPPE, as well as for those with PCs and Property 

Acknowledgement Receipts (PARs) on file but not included in the RPCPPE 

and submit the reports to the CD for recognition in the books of accounts;  

(ii) prepare IlRUP for all PPEs found unserviceable, obsolete and/or no 

longer needed; and (iii) undertake collaborative procedures to ensure that all 

PPEs included in the RPCPPE are duly recorded and that the PCs 

maintained by the GSD/Property Unit are reconciled with the PPELC of the 

CD. 
 
 
Payment of honoraria to DBM designates despite hiring of full-time PS personnel 
 
8. The DBM designates were not relieved from their duties and responsibilities in 

RD operations despite the hiring of Regional PS employees causing the 

government additional cost of P2.774 million. 

 
Section 2b of EO No. 359 provides that the DBM shall establish RDs as part 

of the regular organization structure of the PS from which government agencies may 
locally purchase their common use supplies, materials and equipment requirements.  

 
Part 1(A) of the 2015 PS-PhilGEPS Depot Operations Manual formulated by 

PS serves as the basis for the operation of the depots and sub-depots. The Manual 



58  

includes guidelines of which PS can operate through regional and sub depots upon 
agreement under Parts B.1 and B.2 of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with 
DBM Regional Offices.  

 
Validation of the documents pertaining to depot operations revealed that the 

Revised Depot Operations Manual is not yet finalized. Only an unsigned draft copy of 
the Revised Manual was presented to the Audit Team. The RD MOAs that were 
initially entered into were still effective.  

 
The PS maintains a revolving fund as authorized under LOI No. 755 and no 

other funds are received by them from the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 
2020. A revolving fund is considered as self-perpetuating and self-liquidating as 
defined under Section 9 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA.   

 
The provisions on allowances under the 2015 PS Depot Operations Manual 

are still enforced wherein DBM designates shall receive allowances. The allowance 
for the officers of RDs, who are DBM designates, ranges from P5,500.00 per month 
for the Supply Officer (Administrative Officer) and up to P10,000.00 per month for 
the Depot Supervisor (DBM Regional Director). 

 

It was noted that PS, thru its Human Resource Development Division 
(HRDD), hired and assigned 70 employees under contractual appointment to the 
different RDs in CY 2019, with the purpose of relieving the DBM designates of their 
responsibilities in the RDs. The Regional PS employees were to assume the 
responsibilities previously assigned to DBM designates.  

 

Verification of the transactions over the transition showed that until December 
2020, the DBM designates still received allowances from PS. Information on the 
number of assigned DBM designates and PS employees in the RDs, with the payment 
of allowances and salaries, are shown in the Table 17.

59  

As shown in the Table 17, the government was already spending so much 
amount for the salaries of the newly hired PS Personnel and the PS still continue the 
payment of allowances to the DBM designates which amounted to P2.774 million 
charged to Other Professional Services. No data on allowances paid to the DBM 
designates was secured from RD V since the supporting documents or liquidation 
report of its working fund has not been submitted to PS Main.  

 
In the reply of the DBM Region X to the audit observation of the Region X 

Audit Team, the DBM pointed that although there are newly hired PS employees, full 
responsibility still rests with the DBM designates. The signatories of the 
reports/accountable forms prepared and submitted to PS-Main were DBM designates 
and custody of cash is still with the DBM cashier designate. There was no office 
order from PS-Main on the turnover of accountabilities from the DBM designates to 
the PS hired personnel. In view of the agreement, DBM designates are on “hold over” 
pending final decision by PS-Main. 

 
Inquiry was made with the DOD and HRDD as to the actions taken to resolve 

the transfer of duties and responsibilities from DBM designates to PS employees and 
monitoring of the performance of Regional PS employees. The DOD explained that 
in coordination with HRDD, an office order is yet to be prepared and issued.  

 
We recommended and Management agreed to direct the: 

 

a) Head of HRDD, in coordination with the Head of the DOD, to issue an Office 
Order for approval by the head of the agency, relieving the DBM designates; 

and 

 

b) Head of DOD to: (i) implement proper turnover of duties and responsibilities 

from DBM designates to PS employees in the RDs; and (ii) finalize the 

revised PS-PhilGEPS Depot Operations Manual to have clear policies and 

procedures on the operations of the RDs.  

 

 

Non-preparation/non-maintenance of records, forms and reports 
 

9. Various accounting records, forms, and reports were not prepared/updated or 
maintained, thus, affecting the reliability of the reported accounting data and 

timeliness in the preparation of financial reports. 

 

Volume II of GAM for NGAs prescribes the use of accounting books, 
registries, records, forms, and reports that shall be used by all NGAs in the 
preparation of FSs, as well as the reporting of budget, revenue and expenditure, in 
accordance with the IPSAS and other financial reports as required by laws, rules and 
regulations.

Evaluation showed that various records, forms and reports were not prepared 
in RDs II, III and VI, as shown in Table 18.

The non-preparation or non-maintenance of various expense, inventory and

expenses, and the reconciliation of balances between accounting and property 
records. 

 
We recommended and Management agreed to direct the concerned RD 

Heads to: (a) instruct the Property and Supply Officers in RDs II and III to 

prepare and maintain/update the PAR/ICS in order to establish the 

accountability over inventories/PPE; and, (b) instruct the Accountable Officer 

in RD VI to prepare, update and maintain the required records and reports.  

 
 
Non-renewal of licenses and registration of firearms 
 
10. The registration of PS five firearms issued by the Firearms and Explosive Office, 

Civil Security Group of the PNP had been expired since March 31, 2015 in 

violation of the RA No. 105912 which resulted in the revocation of the 

registration of the firearms.  

 
Republic Act (RA) No. 105912 dated May 29, 2013 is an act of providing for 

a comprehensive law on firearms, ammunition and penalties for its violations. Section 
3 thereof, defines that Long Certificate of Registration (LCR) refers to licenses issued 
to government agencies or offices or government-owned or controlled corporations 
for firearms to be used by their officials and employees who are qualified to possess 
firearms as provider in the Act, excluding security guards. All types of licenses to 
possess a firearm shall be renewed every two years. Failure to renew the LCR may 
cause the revocation, expiration or perpetual disqualification depending on the 
duration of non-renewal. The legal representative or other person who shall 



61  

knowingly come into possession of such firearm should deliver the same to the 
Firearms and Explosives Office (FEO) of the Philippine National Police (PNP).5 

 
As per PS records, the firearms and ammunitions listed under the LCR and are 

currently being used by the in-house security guards/employees of the PS are 
presented in Table 19.

Verification of the records disclosed that the LCR issued on July 17, 2013 to 

the PS covering the above five firearms, duly represented by the Chief Administrative 
Officer (CAO) expired on March 31, 2015. However, when the CAO died on 
December 21, 2013, the firearms registered under his name had never been 
transferred or renewed. 

 
Since the PS Management failed to renew the registration of the firearm, it has 

caused the automatic revocation of the registration of the firearms. Thus, it becomes 
unlawful for the security officers of the PS Main to carry the firearms without a valid 
certificate of registration. For the meantime, the firearms have already been deposited 
under the custody of FEO under acknowledgment receipt no. SK=J=20210603-066 
pending the renewal of the licenses. 

 
We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the OIC-Chief of 

GSD to deliver the five PS firearms and 48 pieces of ammunitions to the FEO of 

the PNP for their proper disposition. 
 

 

Non-observance of timely submission of contracts/purchase orders 
 
11. Out of 112 COVID-19 related contracts/purchase orders (POs), 32 were not 

submitted for review while the 80 contracts/POs were received 10 to 356 days 

beyond the prescribed period, thereby affecting the timely audit disposition on 

the subject transactions. 
 

COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 provides that, in order 
to facilitate review, all government agencies shall submit to the resident auditor a 
copy of perfected contracts, purchase orders and the like, together with supporting 
documents, irrespective of amount involved within five working days upon approval. 
It also provides for penalty clause for unjustified failure to submit contracts and 
supporting documents by the officials and employees concerned, to be subject to

administrative discipline under PD No. 1445, Revised Administrative Code and RA 
No. 6713. 

  
Verification of the contracts for the procurement of COVID-19 related 

supplies and equipment which were considered as common-use supplies by virtue of 
the RA No. 11469 showed that there were no procurement contracts submitted to the 
Audit Team within the prescribed timeline. Out of the 112 contracts/POs executed 
during CY 2020, There were 32 procurement contracts, or 28 per cent totaling P8.852 
billion which have not been submitted including it supporting documents. The PS 
Management has not been keen on observing the required timelines of submission of 
procurement contracts as they were not submitted on time, as shown in Table 20.

There are several personnel from Procurement Divisions and Bids and Award 

Committee (BAC) Secretariat who submit transmittal documents of the contracts/POs 
directly to the Audit Team which resulted in ineffective monitoring of contract 
submission.  This practice may be acceptable but controls, such as, monitoring of the 
timeliness and completeness of the submission of documents must be in place. 
Supervision by the Office of the Director, PG is not inherent in the process. Thus, the 
Procurement Divisions and the BAC Secretariats lacked the accountability on the 
compliance with the aforementioned regulation 

 
The non/delayed submission of the procurement contracts hindered immediate 

information to the Management on the defects and deficiencies noted in the contract 
during the auditorial review. 

 
We recommended and Management agreed to require the Head of the 

PG to: (a) monitor and see to it that all contracts together with supporting 

documents are submitted to the Audit Team for review within five days upon 

approval; (b) provide sanctions for the members of the Procurement Divisions 

or BAC Secretariats who failed to submit the contracts and supporting 

documents for unjustifiable reasons, as prescribed under aforementioned laws 

and regulations; and, (c) require the submission of all contracts not yet 

submitted to the Audit Team for review.

Non-posting of contracts/POs awarded under the Bayanihan Acts 
 

12. Only 62 of the 105 contracts/POs awarded under the Bayanihan Acts (RA Nos. 
11469 and 11494) were posted in the GPPB Online Portal, thus, defeating the 

government’s purpose of transparency and accountability.  

 

Section 2 of the GPPB-TSO Advisory No. 06-2020 dated July 01, 2020 
provides that to ensure transparency and accountability in the implementation of RA 
No. 11469 in relation to government procurement, Procuring Entities (PEs) have 15 
days from the issuance of this Advisory or until July 16, 2020, to post in the GPPB 
Online Portal the required procurement data for all contracts awarded through 
Emergency Procurement under the Bayanihan Act, including those procured through 
the PS, regardless of the funding source. 

 

Further, Section 3 of the GPPB-TSO Resolution No. 19-2020 reminds the PEs 
to comply with the additional posting requirements under RA No. 11494 or the 
Bayanihan 2 for the procurement of Goods, Infrastructure Projects, and Consulting 
Services covered therein and publish the required information and documents in the 
GPPB Online Portal, the website of the PE concerned, if available, and at any 
conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the premises of the PE within seven 
working days from the date of acceptance of the award.  

 
Review of the 105 contracts/POs submitted to the Audit Team disclosed that 

43 of the contracts totaling P13.553 billion were not yet posted in the GPPB Online 
Portal.  Verification of the PS Website showed that contracts were posted, as well as 
in the Bulletin board placed in the PS lobby.  However, of the 105 contracts/POs 
submitted to the Audit Team, 43 of the contracts totaling P13.553 billion were not yet 
posted in the GPPB Online Portal.  

 
The BAC Secretariats assigned to the projects are the ones tasked to upload 

contracts and other documents to the GPPB Online Portal. However, only 62 
contracts were uploaded in the said Portal. 

 
The non-posting of the contracts awarded under RA Nos. 11469 and 11494 in 

the GPPB Online Portal defeated the purpose of transparency and accountability in 
the implementation of these laws. 

 
We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Head of the PG 

to require all COVID-19 related contracts awarded to be uploaded in the GPPB 

Online Portal in compliance with transparency and accountability requirements 

of the government.

Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts/Areas 

 

13. COVID-19-Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 
 

a. Inter-agency transferred funds from client-agencies for the procurement of 
COVID-19 supplies and equipment 

 
For CY 2020, the PS received inter-agency transferred funds from DOH 

of P41.820 billion and from various client agencies of P355.831 million totaling 
P42.176 billion specifically for the procurement of COVID-19 supplies and 
equipment such as alcohol, disinfectant spray, hand sanitizer, tissue paper, 
cadaver bags, extraction machine, personal protective equipment, test kits and 
thermo-gun.  As at December 31, 2020, the amount of P29.226 billion was 
disbursed, consisting of COVID supplies and equipment for the DOH amounting 
to P28.870 billion and P355.830 million for client-agencies. 

 
b. COVID-19-related expenses from PS’ Revolving Fund 

 

The PS, for its own use/consumption, charged COVID-19-related expenses to its 
budget under Personnel Services  and Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses 
amounting to P3.486 million and P7.304 million, respectively. The results of audit 
of these COVID-related transactions are as follows: 

 
 On the provision of food, supplies/materials for essential workforce 

 
Paragraph B, Section VI of AO No. 2020-0015 of the DOH on Risk-

based Public Health Standards Across Settings provides that at the minimum, all 
actors shall implement the prescribed interventions in various settings as 
presented under Annex A, listings of administrative controls and Personal 
Protective Equipment for offices/ workplace, such as the provision of food, tissue, 
masks, among others.  On the other hand, engineering and administrative controls 
include placement of handwashing facilities, hand sanitizers and dispensers with 
alcohol-based solution in all entrances, exits and areas with high foot traffic and 
facilities. 

 
DBM Department Order No. 5, s. 2020, dated March 17, 2020 

confirmed the PS as one of the agencies with critical services. The Alternative 
Work Arrangement for PS was Skeletal Workforce Arrangement (SWA) wherein 
employees were identified to report to office. 

 
Review of the accounts Other Supplies and Materials Expenses, Semi-

Expendable Machinery and Equipment Expenses, Other Maintenance and 
Operating Expenses and Repairs and Maintenance - Building and Other 
Structures with balances totaling P73,682.25, P1.748 million, P2.511 million and 
P36,789.70, respectively or a total of P4.369 million, disclosed that PS incurred 
costs for the provision of alcohol, disinfectant spray, face shield, surgical masks, 
hand soap, office disinfection and support/assistance to PS employees under SWA 



65  

as indicated in the PS Office Order No. 040-20 dated March 23, 2020 and No. 
063-20 dated May 14, 2020.  

 
 On the provision of transportation facilities to employees on skeleton 

workforce  
 

Item C, Section 4.0 of Civil Service Commission Memorandum 
Circular No. 18, s. 2020 states that reasonable transportation facilities and housing 
quarters shall be provided to employees assigned as skeleton workforce, 
whenever practicable, and subject to budgeting, accounting and auditing rules and 
regulations. 

 
The GSD arranged the route and designated drivers for the motor 

vehicles of PS. The number of PS’ motor vehicles cannot accommodate all 
employees required to report physically in the office. Thus, PS leased additional 
van/s in order to accommodate the employees. With the lowered level of 
quarantine by June 2020, the PS entered into Contract of Service (COS) covering 
August 6 to December 29, 2020 for shuttle buses in order to accommodate greater 
number of employees on SWA.  

 
Review of the account Rent/Lease Expenses, Fuel, Oil and Lubricants 

Expenses and Traveling Expenses-Local revealed that PS incurred lease of van/s 
and buses, consumption of fuel and toll fees for the transportation amounting to 
P0.893 million, P476,812.28 and P12,913.00, respectively, as at December 29, 
2020. Verification showed that these transactions were supported by trip tickets, 
receipts, and list of employees with signatures. 

 
 On the grant of hazard pay to employees during the Enhanced Community 

Quarantines (ECQ) /Modified Enhanced Community Quarantines (MECQ)  
 

Section 1 of AO No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 of the Office of the 
President authorized the national government agencies to grant COVID-19 
Hazard Pay to authorized regular, contractual, COS or Job Order (JO) personnel 
who physically reported for work during the implementation of ECQ/MECQ in 
their respective work stations, in an amount not exceeding P500.00 per day per 
person. 

 
Review of the transactions recognized under accounts Hazard Pay and 

Other General Services for CY 2020 disclosed that the PS granted COVID-19 
hazard pay at P500.00/day to 283 PS employees under contractual appointments 
and 98 JO personnel totaling P3.486 million and P1.553 million, respectively.  

 
Verification of the relevant Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) on the grant 

of hazard pay showed that the payments were supported with office orders of PS 
employees including JO personnel authorized to work during the ECQ and 
MECQ, Daily Time Records, duly approved report and statement of services 



66  

rendered and payroll for personnel who actually rendered service as Skeleton

Section 31of the General Provisions of the GAA for CY 2020 provides that all 
agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) designed 
to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the 
applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing 
Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-responsive Development (1995-
2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022). 
  

The GPB shall be integrated into the regular activities of the agencies, which 
shall be at least five per cent of their budgets. The activities currently being 
undertaken by the agencies which relate to GAD or those which contribute to the 
protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and the practice of 
gender-responsive governance, among others, are considered sufficient compliance 
with the said requirement.

15. Senior Citizens, Persons with Disability, and Youth 
 

Section 32, General Provisions, GAA FY 2020 requires all agencies of the 
government to formulate plans, programs, and projects intended to address the 
concerns of Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs), in so far as it 
relates to their mandated functions and integrated the same to their regular activities.  

 
Likewise, Section 33, General Provisions of the same GAA, requires all 

agencies of the government, including government owned or controlled corporations, 
to provide allocations for youth development projects and activities, which shall 
include government internships opportunities, within the framework of the Philippine 
Development Plan (2017-2022). 

 
The activities/accomplishments conducted and implemented during the CY 

2020 which involved all employees in raising awareness and empowerment of the 
SCs, PWDs, and Youth in the workplace were: (1) orientation on SCs, PWDs and 
Youths on benefits and retirement packages; (2) personal hygiene and grooming 
station was set-up to promote good hygiene; (3) livelihood training to create 
sustainable livelihood opportunities; (4) cultural dance presentation to provide youth 
a venue to express and engage them to share their creative talents to other people; 
and, (5) Christmas ornament making. A total of P57,015.08 or 19 per cent of 
P292,490.00 allotted budget was incurred for the said planned activities.  

 
In addition, the PS building has existing architectural features like ramps and 

restroom, which reasonably enhance the mobility, safety, and welfare of SCs and 
PWDs pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA No. 7277. 

 
For other PS projects and activities involving the development of the youth, 

PS was not able to accommodate student interns due to the restrictions in the 
prescribed health protocols, such as, social distancing and number of workforce 
allowed to enter in the office premises.  

 
 

Tax Laws and Regulations, GSIS and Pag-IBIG Premium Contributions and Loan 
Amortizations, and PhilHealth Premium Contributions 
 

16. The inter-agency payable accounts totaling P76.214 million, includes under/over 
remittances of withheld taxes and mandatory contributions due to unreconciled 

balances in the books, thus, the accuracy of the carrying amounts reflected in the 

financial statements could not be ascertained. 
 

The inter-agency payable accounts totaling P76.214 million as at December 
31, 2020 which are summarized in Table 22, includes withheld taxes/mandatory 
contributions and remittances of premium contributions and loans:

Of the ending balance of the Due to BIR of P75.617 million as at December 
31, 2020, P74.474 million was remitted in January and February of 2021, thereby 
leaving a balance of P1.143 million of which P1.170 million were taxes already 
withheld  from the unreleased checks payment to First Data Corporation. The said 
checks were only released in CY 2021 and the corresponding taxes withheld were 
remitted on May 9, 2021. Thus, of the ending balance of P75.617 million, a total of 
P75.644 million was remitted, leaving a negative balance of P26,989.13 subject for 
reconciliation by the CD. 

 

For the Due to GSIS, the amount remitted in CY 2021 amounted to P1.179 
million, leaving a negative balance of P0.873 million.  Verification of the account 
disclosed that in CY 2020 there were unremitted and over-remitted GSIS premiums 
and loans of various employees totaling P3.110 million. 

 
The OIC-Chief Accountant did not review the accuracy of the remittances by 

the Head of Treasury Division against the deductions made. The Head of the Treasury 
Division, who was formerly assigned in the CD to prepare the GSIS remittance 
remained as the one doing it although it is no longer his duty and responsibility and 
against the principle of internal control on the segregation of duties. 

 
The GSIS billings sent to PS were always understated because of incorrect 

salary rate of the employees in the GSIS system and the new hired employees had 
still no GSIS Business Partner Number. This condition increases the unremitted 
deductions which only shows the lack of reconciliation and review of this account. 

 
Analysis of the Due to Pag-IBIG disclosed of the ending balance of 

P86,545.53, the amount of P109,997.49 was remitted, leaving a negative balance of 
P23,451.96 based on Summary of Check Issued for January 2021. However, upon 
verification, the Audit Team identified some of over/under remittance of Pag-IBIG 
premiums and loans totaling P10,030.25 in CY 2020, which made the existing 
negative balance increased to P33,482.21. 



70  

Review of the Due to PhilHealth revealed that the DVs showing remittances 
were based on PhilHealth Employees Premium Remittance List provided by the 
PhilHealth, thus, in terms of compliance with PhilHealth, there were no unremitted 
balance for CY 2020. However, out of the P203,668.20 ending balance in CY 2020, 
only P170,576.79 was remitted, leaving a balance of P33,091.41.  

 
The Audit Team observed that all these deficiencies could be attributed to 

weak or absence of control over the imposition of deductions, reconciliation and 
review on the deductions and remittances made.   

 
The negative balances of the accounts, likewise, affects the fair presentation 

of the Inter-Agency Payables in the financial statements. The risk also occurs that 
employees’ contributions and loan repayments may not be received and credited by 
GSIS, Pag-IBIG, and PhilHealth, which may later deprive the employees of services 
and benefits that may be availed from these institutions. 

 
We recommended that Management relieve the Head of the Treasury of 

the duties and responsibilities in the preparation of GSIS remittances and 

require: 

 

a) OIC-Chief Accountant to: (i) complete the reconciliation of Due to BIR, Due 
to GSIS, Due to Pag-IBIG and Due to PhilHealth pertaining to prior years’ 

unreconciled balances; (ii) require the personnel in-charge of the payrolls to 

conduct a regular reconciliation of accounts so that what is deducted from 

the employees’ salaries should be the same amount to be remitted on or 

before their due dates; (iii) analyze the negative balances  of the Inter-Agency 

Payable accounts and prepare the necessary adjustments; and (iv) remit the 

unremitted balances of the Inter-Agency Payable accounts and henceforth 

ensure the timely remittance of these mandatory deductions; and 

 

b) OIC-Chief of HRDD to regularly update the salary rate of the PS employees 
to the GSIS system so that correct GSIS Billing is provided to the PS as basis 

for payment of premiums and loans. 

 

 
17. Information and Publicity on Projects/Programs/Activities (PPA) 

 
Item 2.2 of COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 2013 requires that 

notification to the public and other forms of announcement and/or publicity related 
to the PPAs shall be made at the least possible cost through posting relevant 
information on signboards, blackboards, whiteboards, among others, or similar 
materials in conspicuous places within the agency premises, and in the venue where 
the PPA is located or carried out. 

 



71  

Verification of the Report of Quarterly Publicized PPAs showed that the 
publicity prescribed in COA Circular No. 2013-004 is not applicable to the PS as it 
has no projects intended to be publicized. 

 
 

18. Transparency in Infrastructure Projects 
 
Section 93 of the General Provisions, GAA for FY 2020 requires all agencies 

of government to post in their websites details regarding infrastructure projects, such 
as the project title, location, detailed description, detailed estimates in arriving at the 
Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC), and winning contractor and the detailed 
estimates of the bid as awarded, within 30 calendar days from entering into contract, 
among others. 

 
The PS has no infrastructure projects that need to be posted in its website. 

 
 

19. Transparency Seal on the Official Website 
 

Under Section 94 of the General Provisions, GAA for FY 2020, in order to 
enhance transparency and enforce accountability, all agencies of government shall 
maintain a Transparency Seal (TS) to be posted on their website.  The TS shall 
contain vital information such as agency’s mandates and functions, names of its 
officials with their position and designation, and contact information, approved 
budgets and corresponding targets, among others. 

 
The PS has substantially complied with the posting requirements of all the 

required reports/information in the TS of its website except for the posting of 
contracts awarded, Financial Accountability Report Nos. 5 and 6, although DBM 
through its letter dated May 5, 2020 stated that posting of Budget and FARs is not 
applicable as PS does not receive allotment from GAA. 
 

 

20. GSIS Property Insurance Law 
 

Section 5 of RA No. 656, otherwise known as the “Property Insurance Law”, 
as amended by PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973, requires that properties of the 
government are to be insured with the General Insurance Fund (GIF), as administered 
by the GSIS, against any insurable risk primarily for the indemnification or 
compensation of any government agency for any damage or loss through theft, fire or 
any unforeseen event. 

 
COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 also prescribes the 

guidelines in the submission of the Property Inventory Form as basis for the 
assessment of general insurance coverage over all insurable assets, properties and 
interests of the government with the GIF of the GSIS.  



72  

 
For CY 2020, the PS insured its properties with the GSIS amounting to 

P15.359 billion with the corresponding insurance premiums paid in the amount of 
P2.377 million.  The details are shown in Table 23.

21. Hiring of Casual, JOs, Contractual and Consultants 

 

COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2, series of 2020, allowed agencies to hire new 
COS and JO workers and renew existing contracts of COS and JO workers until 
December 31, 2022. The PS directly hired individual workers under JO to perform 
specific jobs or to supplement their current manpower. There were 98 JOs assigned 
to provide warehouse keeping, clerical and administrative assistance as of December 
31, 2020. 

 
The PS has included in the contracts of JOs the payment of salary or wage 

equivalent to the daily salary or wage of comparable positions in the government and 
a premium of up to 20 per cent of the salary wage.  The hiring of JOs is within the 
parameters provided for in the joint circular and no deficiency was noted. Total 
payment for the wages of JOs in CY 2020 amounted to P27.325 million. 

 
 

22. Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges 
 

There were no Notice of Suspension (NSs), Notice of Disallowance (NDs), 
and Notice of Charge (NCs), as well as Notice of Settlement of 
Suspension/Disallowances/Charge (NSSDCs) issued in CY 2020.  As at December 
31, 2020, the balances of suspensions, disallowances and charges amounted to 
P2.460 billion, P91.785 million, and P0.00, respectively, representing balances of

and 5 NSs amounting to P696.429 million from CY 2017.  These NSs were issued 
mostly due to lack of documentary requirements, such as bidding documents, latest 
income tax, registrations, detailed breakdown of ABC, and other related procurement 
documents.  

 
The Management has submitted various documents for the settlement of the 

16 NSs totaling P11.687 million, of which 10 NSs totaling P4.256 million were 
evaluated and issued with NSSDCs in April 2021. The Team is still evaluating the
