EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 
A. Introduction 
 

The Procurement Service (PS) is mandated to implement a central procurement 

system for the purpose of procuring supplies and materials for use of the national 

government (NG) and its agencies and instrumentalities, pursuant to Letter of 

Instruction (LOI) No. 755, dated October 18, 1978.  The LOI is anchored on the 

policy of procuring supplies and materials in the most economical and efficient 

manner, by purchasing directly from reliable sources in economic lot sizes, 

observing optimum specifications, and making prompt payments. The same LOI 

put PS under the administrative supervision of the Department of Budget and 

Management (DBM).  

 

Executive Order (EO) No. 285, dated  July 25, 1987, transferred the functions of the 

Supply Coordination Office to the PS, while EO No. 359, dated  June 2, 1989, 

established, as part of its regular organization structure, the regional depots (RDs) 

and sub-depots (SDs) from which government agencies may locally purchase their 

common use supplies, materials, and equipment requirements. This was followed 

by the launching of the government-wide Philippine Government Electronic 

Procurement System (PhilGEPS) under the management of the PS by virtue of EO 

No. 40, dated  October 8, 2001. 

 

The issuance of Administrative Order (AO) No. 17, dated  July 28, 2011 reiterated 

to all government agencies that their procurement of common use supplies shall be 

done through the PS and that the PhilGEPS shall be used in all their procurement 

activities, including publication of all their bid opportunities and posting of all their 

awards and contracts, in accordance with Republic Act (RA) No. 9184. 

 

The PS operates on its own income and does not receive any allotment from the 

NG. Presently, the PS is headed by Atty. Jasonmer L. Uayan as Officer-in Charge 

of the overall operations of the office.  As of  December 31, 2020, the PS, including 

in the 11 regional depots, had 448 total personnel complement, composed of 350 

contractual and 98 job order employees.

C. Scope and Objectives of Audit  
 

The audit covered the financial accounts and operations for CY 2020 of the PS.  

The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on 

Management’s assertions on the financial statements (FSs); (b) determine the 

propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, 

rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and (d) 

determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations. 
 

For CY 2020, the audit covered the review, on a sampling basis, the accounts and 

operations of the PS and its regional and local government unit depots, the result of 

which are consolidated in this report.  

 

 

D. Audit Methodology  
 

We adopted a risk-based audit approach in  the audit of the FSs of the PS and in the 

review of compliance with laws, rules, and regulations.  The Audit Team which 

carried out the audit, among others; (a) examined financial and accounting 

procedures adopted by the PS and other relevant documentation; (b) assessed 

internal controls regulating financial operations  and carried out compliance testing 

for determining the extent of control in operations; (c) conducted substantive 



 iii 

testing of a representative sample of selected transactions;  (d) carried out review, 

on test check basis, of a number of contracts and transactions related to movements 

in balances of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses; and (e) conducted 

interviews and held discussions with the concerned officials and staff  in the PS.  

 

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and the 

concerned officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda.  

 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

A qualified opinion was rendered on the fairness of presentation of the PS’s FSs as 

at December 31, 2020 due to material accounting errors and omissions that affected 

the balances of accounts Due from National Government Agencies, Due from 

Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations, Due to NGAs, Due to GOCCs, 

Allowance for Impairment-Merchandise Inventory, Office Equipment, Information 

and Communication Technology Equipment, Motor Vehicles, Furniture and 

Fixtures, Accounts Payable Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit), Cost of Sales and 

Transportation and Delivery Expenses as discussed in Part I - Independent Auditor’s 

Report, and Part II – Observations and Recommendations of this report.    

 
F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 

 

Among the audit observations and the corresponding recommendations discussed in 

Part II of this report, the significant observations are summarized, as follows: 

 

1. Various accounting errors/omissions affected the fair presentation of the 
reported balances of the accounts in the FSs.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Officer in-Charge 

(OIC)-Chief Accountant to: (a) effect the necessary adjustments to correct 

the reported balances of the affected accounts in the FSs; and, (b)  

henceforth, observe the proper/correct recognition of transactions in 

accordance with the Government Accounting Manual for National 

Government Agencies and other applicable accounting rules and 

regulations. 

 

2. The completeness, accuracy, and existence of several assets and liabilities could 
not be readily ascertained due to variances between books and related records 

and non-compliance with accounting policies, guidelines and procedures, and 

agreements, among others: 

 

a. Deficiencies in accounting controls over collection of receivables 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the OIC-Chief 

Accountant to: (a) send out periodic Statement of Accounts to debtor-client 



 iv 

agencies, informing them the nature and the amount of their 

accounts/obligations; (b) deduct the cost of over-delivered items to the 

existing balance of DBM in the books of the PS; (c) exert extra effort to 

identify P474,415.60 prior years balances and make necessary adjustments 

or request for write-off the unidentified dormant receivables. 

 

b. Deficiency in accounting controls for unidentified deposits resulting in idle 
funds 

 

We recommended that Management instruct the: 

 

a) OIC-Chief Accountant to: (i) remit to the Bureau of the Treasury 
(BTr) the accumulated idle/unidentified deposits from CYs 2004 to 

2019 amounting to P117.701 million; and (ii) monitor the deposits 

made in the current year to the PS without corresponding Agency 

Procurement Request (APR), and remit the same if warranted; and,  

 

b) Director, Operations Group (OG) to establish a policy that will identify 
all the deposits made by the client agencies, such as, coordination with 

the LBP to require depositors-client agencies to submit copy of APR 

duly acknowledged by the PS, and other control mechanism, in order 

to stop the practice of the client-agencies of depositing their funds to 

the PS without the corresponding APR. 

 

c. Unaccounted Information and Communications Technology (ICT) 
equipment and semi-expendable property in RD XIII. 

 

We recommended that Management in RD XIII to: (a) inquire with the 

Comptroller Division (CD) of PS-Main on the proper treatment of the 

property and equipment charged against the profit share; (b) prepare 

letters demanding the production of the PPE addressed to the concerned 

accountable officers who were issued with the items considered as missing 

during the physical count; (c) direct the RD Accountant to reiterate the 

RD’s request to the CD of PS-Main for copy of the Property, Plant and 

Equipment Ledger Cards and other pertinent documents and reconcile 

these against the updated property records maintained by the Depot 

Property Officer; (d) analyze and identify the causes of the discrepancies 

for necessary adjustments in the records and furnish the OIC-Chief 

Accountant of PS-Main the results of the reconciliation conducted for the 

adjustments in the books of accounts; and (e) require the Inventory 

Committee to appropriately report the physical count of semi-expendable 

property covered by Inventory Custodian Slip in the Report on Physical 

Count of Inventories. 

 

3. Inter-agency transferred funds and Other Payables totaling P10.870 billion 
pertaining to advances for common-used supplies and equipment (CSE) which 

remained undelivered/unutilized and dormant for years were still not remitted to 



 v 

the BTr, thus, depriving the government the use of funds in the implementation 

of its project/programs. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the OIC-Chief 

Accountant to:  (a)  remit to the BTr the amount of P10.870 billion, 

composed of advances from client-agencies representing unused/unutilized 

advances and deposits made by unknown client-agencies for several years 

now; and, (b) inform the client-agencies of the remittance of P10.864 billion 

made to the BTr so that proper adjustments will be made in the client 

agencies’ respective books of accounts. 
 

4.    CSE items were frequently out-of-stock caused by lack of effective inventory 
management system, which resulted in unserved APRs and consequently in the 

loss of sales estimated at P360.861 million to the agency.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the:  

 

a) Chairperson of the Reorder Point Policy Committee to: (i) establish the 
Reorder Point Policy in coordination with concerned divisions; and, (ii) 

regularly evaluate the compliance with the Reorder Point Policy by 

Warehousing and Delivery Division (WADD) and Procurement Group 

(PG), once established; 

 

b) Chief, WADD to monitor the level of CSE and notify the PG when the 
CSE items reach the reorder point determined by the Committee; and, 

 

c) Head, PG to procure immediately the CSE items upon receipt of 
notification from WADD. 

 

We also recommended and Management in RD XI agreed to: (a)  look into 

the available stocks in the PS-Main before making request; (b)  monitor the 

Transfer of Stocks to be shipped by PS-Main  in accordance with the 

request of the region in order to avoid unnecessary deliveries; (c) intensify 

coordination with PS-Main for the immediate delivery of items requested; 

and, (d) direct the RD’s personnel to revisit the PS-PhilGEPS Depot 

Operations Manual for guidance in improving depot inventory 

management. 

 

5.    Absence of clear policy on handling inventories manifested by poor 
coordination among operating offices of the agency resulted in slow-moving 

COVID-19 items totaling P95.455 million.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned heads 

of groups/divisions: 

 



 vi 

a) Director, Operations Group to: (i) spearhead the establishment of a 
clear policy laying down marketing or sales strategy timelines that would 

minimize stock handling of moderate to slow-moving items and identify 

the responsibilities and accountabilities of the different operating 

offices/divisions; (ii) secure relative historical data from WADD,  

Marketing and Sales Division (MSD) and Depot Operations Division 
(DOD) to aid in policymaking; and (iii) regularly evaluate the 

performance/accomplishment of WADD, MSD and DOD, once 

established; 

 

b) Chief, WADD to monitor and report to MSD upon identifying the 
classification of inventory items; 

 

c) Chief, MSD to: (i) coordinate with WADD on the classification of critical 
inventory items; and (ii) devise marketing or sales strategy that would 

effectively speed up the sale of the surgical mask and face shield and 

other slow moving items identified by WADD;  and, 

 

d) Chief, DOD to coordinate with MSD, WADD and ROG for marketing 
and sales strategies in each classification of the inventory items in the 

RDs. 

 

6.   The DBM designates were not relieved from their duties and responsibilities in 
RD operations despite the hiring of Regional PS employees causing the 

government additional cost of P2.774 million. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the: 

 

a) Head of Human Resource Development Division, in coordination with 
the Head of the DOD, to issue an Office Order for approval by the head 

of the agency, relieving the DBM designates; and, 

 

b) Head of DOD to: (i) implement proper turnover of duties and 

responsibilities from DBM designates to PS employees in the RDs; and, 

(ii) finalize the revised PS-PhilGEPS Depot Operations Manual to have 

clear policies and procedures on the operations of the RDs.  

 

7. Out of 112 COVID-19 related contracts/purchase orders (POs), 32 were not 
submitted for review while the 80 contracts/POs were received 10 to 356 days 

beyond the prescribed period, thereby affecting the timely audit disposition on 

the subject transactions. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Head of the PG 

to: (a) monitor and see to it that all contracts together with supporting 

documents are submitted to the Audit Team for review within five days 

upon approval; (b)  provide sanctions for the members of the Procurement 



 vii 

Divisions or Bids and Awards Committee Secretariats who failed to submit 

the contracts and supporting documents for unjustifiable reasons, as 

prescribed under aforementioned laws and regulations; and, (c) require the 

submission of all contracts not yet submitted to the Audit Team for review. 

 

8. Only 62 of the 105 contracts/POs awarded under the Bayanihan Acts (RA Nos. 
11469 and 11494) were posted in the Government Procurement Policy Board  

(GPPB) Online Portal, thus, defeating the government’s purpose of transparency 

and accountability.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Head of the PG to 

require all COVID-19 related contracts awarded to be uploaded in the 

GPPB Online Portal in compliance with transparency and accountability 

requirements of the government. 

 

The aforementioned observations and recommendations and Management comments 

were summarized in a Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations and 

sent to Management on May 26, 2021 for its further comments in lieu of an exit 

conference.  Management’s views and comments were incorporated in the report, 

where appropriate. 

 

 

G.  Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 
 

There were no Notice of Suspension (NSs), Notice of Disallowance (NDs), and 

Notice of Charge (NCs), as well as Notice of Settlement of 

Suspension/Disallowances/Charge issued in CY 2020.  As at December 31, 2020, the 

balances of suspensions, disallowances and charges amounted to P2.460 billion, 

P91.785 million, and P0.00, respectively, representing balances of NSs/NDs/NCs 

issued in prior years.  The details are shown in Part II of this report. 

 

 

H. Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations 
  

Of the 93 audit recommendations embodied in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report, 52 

were implemented, and 41 were not implemented. The details are discussed in Part 

III of this Report.  

  

We enjoin Management to ensure full implementation of all audit 

recommendations to improve the financial and operational efficiency of the 

agency.
