Low fund utilization/obligation



2)		Overall, the agency’s fund utilization/obligation of  P66.528 million is 69.60 percent compared to its allotment of  P95.572 million during the year, of which P 13.764 million or 18.93 percent pertains to one of its major programs, the Business Management Training Service (BMTS), which registered a utilization rate of 93.79 percent and in accordance with the purpose of appropriation/allotment. The unutilized fund of P9.011 million and P20.034 million for the current and continuing fund, respectively was due to the                 (a) deferral of procurement of motor vehicles, ICT and office equipment; and (b) non-consummation of lease for additional workspace which was affected by the restrictions during the pandemic.



	Section 60, General Provisions (GPs) of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 General Appropriations Act (GAA) provides that all appropriations authorized under the FY 2020 GAA, xxx xxx, shall be available for release and disbursement for the purpose specified, and under the same General and Special Provisions of said GAA applicable thereto until December 31, 2020.”

	

Moreover, Section 62, GPs of the FY 2021 GAA & FY President’s Veto Message provides that all appropriations authorized under the FY 2021 GAA, xxx xxx, shall be available for release, obligation and disbursement for the purpose specified, and under the same General and Special  Provisions of said GAA applicable thereto until December 31, 2021.” 



In addition, Section 3.6 of NBC No. 583 provides for the extension of appropriations, particularly Section 3.6.1 which is until June 30, 2021 for release, obligation and disbursement of items appropriated under Republic Act No. 11494 (Bayanihan to Recover as One Act or Bayanihan II), as extended pursuant to RA No. 11519 ( an act extending the availability of appropriations under RA 11494), and Section 3.6.2 until December 31, 2021 for release, obligation and disbursement of appropriation items i.e., PS, MOOE and CO, under RA No. 11465 (GAA for FY 2020), as extended pursuant to RA No. 11520 ( an act  extending  the availability of the 2020 appropriations to December 31, 2021, amending for the purpose  section 60 of the General Provisions of RA 11465 or the GAA of the FY 2020).



	The Center has utilized only P66.528 million or 69.60 percent of its total approved budget of P95.573 million for CY 2020.  Details shown as follows:

	Validation of the submitted Report of Allotment, Obligations and Disbursements (RAOD) disclosed that the unutilized balance amounting to P29.045 million was due to the non-utilization of allotted budgets for management and maintenance of facilities   for   training,   exhibitions,  conferences  and  other  activities  such  as:  (a) deferral  of  procurement  of  motor  vehicles,  ICT  and  office equipment; and (b) non-consummation of lease for additional workspace  which was affected by the restrictions during the pandemic.

	

Although the agency was not able to fully utilize its budget in accordance with NBC No. 578 dated January 6, 2020, the validity of the fund balance was extended up to December 31, 2021, pursuant to the abovementioned NBC No. 583.  



Moreover, of the total budget of P13.764 million received for the BMTS for CY 2020, about 93.79 percent or P12.909 million was utilized.  The details are shown below:

	We recommended and Management agreed to ensure that all budgeted programs and projects for the year will be implemented to prevent low utilization of funds and provide justification for such deficiency.

	

 High cash utilization/disbursements rate



3)	Of the total cash allocation received during the year of P72.289 million, 92.18 percent or P66.638 million were utilized/disbursed and found to be in order pursuant to Executive Order 91 dated September 9, 2019.  Also, disbursements of P10.556 million or 90.33 percent out of the total obligation of P11.686 million for the BMTS, were regular, necessary and not excessive, extravagant and unconscionable. 



 Executive Order 91 dated September 9, 2019 prescribes the adoption of the Cash Budgeting System beginning Fiscal Year 2020, and for other purposes.  Section 1.a of EO 91 states that, “All authorized appropriations shall be available for obligation and disbursement only until the end of each Fiscal year (FY).”



A total cash allocation of P72.289 million was received by PTTC for CY 2020, of which P66.638 million or 92.18 percent was spent and the balance of P5.651 million which was not utilized due to the deferral of some programs/ activities caused by the restrictions during pandemic was reverted back to the Bureau of Treasury, as shown below:

There were also no unliquidated cash advances in prior years. 

	

Fund transfers to implementing agencies and NGOs/POs



6)		There were no funds transferred to National Government Agencies (NGAs), Local Government Units (LGUs), Government Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) and Non-Government Organizations/People’s Organizations (NGOs/POs) during the year and prior years. 



Non-liquidation of fund transfers to PS-DBM and PITC



7)		Fund transfers to Procurement Service – Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) for its office supplies requirement amounting to P0.632 million or 29.23 percent of the funds transferred were not liquidated.  Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers to PS-DBM and Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) in prior years amounting to P14.739 million or 96.64 percent of prior year’s balance of P15.251 million.

	

COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 sets out the rules and regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred from the Source Agency (SA) to the Implementing Agency (IA). The SA shall require the submission by the IA of the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds transferred within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of agreed period for the Project; and the return to the SA of any unused balance upon completion of the project.

	To date, the KVA generator set is already in the premises of PTTC but it cannot be used due to the failure of the contractor (to whom the PS entered into an agreement to procure/ install the generator), to comply with the requirements set  as follows:



--	No permit to operate from DENR;

--	No permit to operate from LGU;

--	No lead detection sensor from the concrete containment cistern;

--	No training of PTTC personnel; and

--	No supply of full tank after testing



	Due to the failure of the contractor, the unit could not be used in operation and acceptance could not be made unless he complied with the requirements. Hence, PS-DBM could not liquidate the said fund transfer to the Center and the item is still considered undelivered.

	

	Moreover, the balance of fund transfer made in July 28, 2016 to PITC for the provision of management, technical staff, substantive and related services in the implementation of upgrading of PTTC expertise amounting to P2.716 million remained unliquidated as of year-end because of the revision in the Agency Outsourcing Request and Terms of Reference. The revisions were coordinated with PITC including definite timelines for the completion of the procurement process and their subsequent installation.



	Management commented that they made a follow-up letter on August 28, 2020 to PS-DBM requesting them to make a follow up from the contractor and it is still waiting for the response and the liquidation of the fund transfer. 

 

	This is a reiteration of prior year’s observation and the delay in the delivery of goods and services deprived PTTC of the benefits of the purpose or intended use of the items in its operation and defeats the use of other agencies of the Government of the Philippines (GoP) to undertake procurement and hasten project implementation.



	We recommended and Management agreed to continue the strict and close follow ups on the status of fund transfers to both PS-DBM and PITC.



	Dormant accounts for write-off	



8)		The agency has no dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers for write-off, in accordance with Section 8.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



Insurance of physical assets with GSIS  



9)		The Center insured with the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) property with book value of P62.778 and appraised value of P55.373 million with corresponding insurance premiums paid in the amount of P0.373 million, in accordance with RA No. 656, otherwise known as the “Property Insurance Law” as amended by PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973. 

	

Disposal of unserviceable property



10)	Unserviceable property listed in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) as of December 31, 2020, with book value of P2.810 million were not disposed of as of year-end, contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 1445, due to the restrictions caused by the pandemic situation which is beyond the control of the Center.  However, disposal thereof was made on January 12, 2021.

	

	Section 79 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 states that “When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee an award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the Commission, x x x.”



Procurement Activities during a State of Calamity (CoVid 19 Pandemic) 



11)		Procurement of various goods during the State of Calamity relating to the mitigation and containment of the transmission of CoVid 19 amounting to P0.150 million were conducted in accordance with Section 3.1 of Joint Memorandum Circular (JMC) No. 1, Commission On Audit (COA) & Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB), dated March 26, 2020 and GPPB issued Resolution Nos. 03-2020 and 05-2020 to simplify and streamline the Rules on negotiated Procurement (Emergency Cases).

Also, 168 contracts and POs with their supporting documents amounting to P35.553 million were submitted and verified to be  complete  and in order.



	Section 3.1.1 of  COA Circular 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 states that “within five  (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, xxx, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.”



	Section 3.2.1 of the same circular states that “a copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and every supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned.”



	The Center has submitted 37 government contracts, of which eight contracts amounting to P14.802 million were delayed.  Also, of the 141 purchase orders (POs), nine were submitted late while four were not submitted which amounted to P0.738 million and P0.065 million, respectively. Details, as follows:

The submission of various contracts and POs per schedule above were delayed ranging from one to 91 days which affected the timely review and communication to management of any deficiencies that may be found in audit. The Property and Human Resource officers are in charged with the submission of the contracts and POs and their failure to submit on time affected the timely review of the documents.



The contracts and POs were reviewed and all were compliant with the requirements. Except for some lacking documents which the management immediately submitted when we called their attention.



It is worthy to mention that there were no delays in the submission in prior years, however, due to change of the personnel assigned in the monitoring of documents, lack of manpower and the restrictions during the global pandemic, submission of some documents were delayed. The four POs were not submitted as of year-end because they are all emergency in nature.  

	 

	Management commented that it is committed to submit the documents (POs, contracts, MOAs, JOs) before the due date.



	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Property and Human Resource officers to submit all copies of PTTC contracts and POs together with the required supporting documents within the prescribed period, pursuant to existing rules and regulations and assign personnel to take charge in monitoring and submission of the required documents.

Moreover, it failed to secure an approved GAD Plan and Budget despite repeated attempts to access the link and get an online approval due to the de-activation of its account with the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) which was beyond their control.

	

	Section 31 of RA No. 11465 or the General Appropriations Act of FY 2020 states that “All agencies of the government shall Formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under R.A.

	The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.”



	GAD Plan and Budget showed that the agency allotted P3.397 million or 4.55 percent of its appropriation of P74.651 million for its GAD Plan and Implementation pursuant to R.A. No. 11465 or the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020.

	

	The Annual GAD Accomplishment Report for CY 2020 revealed that the agency spent P2.728 million which is 80 percent of the allocated budget, as shown below, due to health and mobility restrictions during pandemic.
