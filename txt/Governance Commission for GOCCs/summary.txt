A. Introduction 
 

The enactment in June 2011 of Republic Act (RA) No. 10149 entitled “An 

Act to Promote Financial Viability and Fiscal Discipline in Government-Owned or 

Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) and to Strengthen the Role of the State in its 

Governance and Management to Make Them More Responsive to the Needs of 

Public Interest and For Other Purposes”, otherwise known as the GOCC 

Governance Act of 2011, paved the creation of the Governance Commission for

Among the salient and significant powers and functions of GCG are the

consultation with the department or agency to which a GOCC is attached; 
 

 Conduct periodic study, examination, evaluation and assessment of the 
performance of the GOCCs, and require reports on its operations and 

management including its assets and finances;  
 

 Conduct compensation studies, develop and recommend to the President a 
competitive compensation and remuneration system which attracts and 

retain talent at the same time allowing the GOCCs to be financially sound 

and sustainable; and 
 

 Provide technical advice and assistance to the government agencies to 
which the GOCCs are attached in setting performance objectives and its 

targets and monitors its performance vis-à-vis established objectives and 

targets. 

 

Pursuant to Section 6, Chapter II of RA No. 10149, the GCG shall be 

composed of five members: the Chairman with the rank of Cabinet Secretary, two

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of the GCG for CY 2020.  It 

was conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the 

Management’s assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the propriety of 

transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and 

regulations; c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and d) determine the 

extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.  Moreover, the 

audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 

Institutions (ISSAIs).   

 

 

E. Opinion of the auditor on the fairness of presentation of the Financial 
Statements 

 

The Auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of presentation 

of the financial statements of GCG as at December 31, 2020. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations  
 

The following are the significant audit observations and corresponding 

recommendations: 

  

1. Deficiencies were noted in the granting and utilization of petty cash fund 
(PCF) such as (a) incomplete documentation in the grant of Petty Cash (PC) 

advances totaling P80,000.00, (b) the amount of PCF was way beyond the 

recurring expenses for one month, (c) the PCF is being closed at every year-

end, and (d) two Petty Cash Fund Custodians (PCFCs) were not properly 

bonded inconsistent with COA Circular No. 97-002, as amended by COA 

Circular No. 2006-005 and Chapter 6, Volume I of the Government 

Accounting Manual (GAM). (Paragraph No. 1). 

 

 

 

 



v 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a. Chief Accountant to ensure that the grants of PC advances are supported 
with complete documentary requirement;  

 

b. Heads of offices that request PCF to review their monthly recurring petty 
operating expenses; hence, a realistic PCF sufficient for one month’s use 

would be set up; 

 

c. PCFCs and the Chief Accountant to observe the accounting policies in the 
utilization and liquidation of PCF as prescribed under Section 35(b), 

Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM and COA Circular 97-002; and  

 

d. Chairman to ensure that all Accountable Officers (AOs) are properly 
bonded as required. 

  

2. Only 25 percent or P1,500,000.00 of the P6,000,000.00 contract for the 
procurement of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Software Solution was 

completed and delivered by the supplier within the stipulated period in the 

Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to enhance and improve the internal 

processes and the tracking of accurate information related to Human 

Resource and inventory control of the agency. (Paragraph No. 2). 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the:  
 

a. Chief Accountant to compute the corresponding liquidated damages (LD) 
against the DBP Data Center, Inc. (DCI) pursuant to Section 3.1, Annex D 

of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of the 

RA No. 9184, and ensure that the total amount of the LD shall not exceed 

10 per cent of the total contract price, in which event the GCG may rescind 

the MOA and impose appropriate sanctions over and above the LD; 
 

b. Chief Accountant to deduct the LD from any amount due or which may 
become due to the DCI, or collect from any securities or warranties posted 

by the DCI, whichever is convenient to the GCG; and 
 

c. Director III/Chief of Staff of the Office of the Chairman to strictly monitor 
the completion and delivery of the ERP Software Solution.  

 

3. Of the Accounts Payable balance of P7,774,325.03, a total of P1,555,895.77 
have been outstanding for two years or more but were not reverted to the 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account of the General Fund, inconsistent 

with Section 1 of Executive Order (EO) No. 87 dated August 13, 2019. 

(Paragraph No. 3). 

 

 

 



vi 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant 

to revert the accounts payable totaling P1,555,895.77 to the Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) account in compliance with Section 1 of EO No. 87.  

 

4. Of the Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable balance of P3,053,549.69, 
P923,415.85 or 30.24 per cent has been dormant for more than five years but 

no proper disposition/closure thereof has been done as required under Section 

III of the COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 05, 1997. (Paragraph No. 

4). 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant 

to:  
 

a. review and analyze the dormant guaranty/security deposits, and determine, 
through confirmation letters, whether their purpose have already been 

fulfilled by the suppliers/contractors; 

 

b. henceforth, inform the suppliers/contractors to request for the 
refund/release of the guaranty/security deposits supported with complete 

documentation; and 
 

c. request for authority to write-off if justified, strictly in accordance with the 
requirements of COA Circular 97-001. 

 

The above findings and recommendations were discussed with Management 

officials concerned in an exit conference held on April 21, 2021.  Management 

views and comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate.  The 

details of the above observations were discussed in Part II of this report.  

 

 

G. Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 

Of the three audit recommendations contained in the CY 2019 Annual Audit 

Report (AAR), two were implemented and one was not implemented.
