OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Financial Audit 
 

Deficiencies in petty cash fund (PCF) transactions 

 

1. Deficiencies were noted in the granting and utilization of PCF such as              
(a) incomplete documentation in the grant of PC advances totaling P80,000.00, 

(b) the amount of PCF was way beyond the recurring expenses for one month, 

(c) the PCF is being closed at every year-end, and (d) two Petty Cash Fund 

Custodians (PCFCs) were not properly bonded inconsistent with COA 

Circular No. 97-002, as amended by COA Circular No. 2006-005 and Chapter 

6, Volume I of the GAM. 
 

a) Incomplete documentation in the grant of PC advances 
 

As required by Sections 36 (a and b), Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM, the 

grant of PC advances should be supported with the following documents:  

 

a. Granting of Petty Cash Advance 
 

1. Authority of an accountable officer issued by the Head of 
the Agency or his/her duly authorized representatives 

indicating the maximum accountability and purpose of cash 

advance (for initial cash advance);  

2. Certification from the Accountant that previous cash 
advances have been liquidated and accounted for in the 

books; and  

3. Approved application for bond and/or Fidelity Bond for the 
year for cash accountability of P5,001 or more as provided 

under Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009.  

 

b. Additional Documentary Requirements for initial cash 
advances  

 

1. Approved estimates of petty expenses for one month; and  
2. Copy of policy for maintaining PCF under the imprest 

system.  

 

Review and examination of the disbursement vouchers (DVs) relative to the 

grant of PC advances showed that it was not supported with complete 

documentation. No certification from the Accountant that previous cash advances 

have been liquidated and accounted for in the books was attached, and the approved 

estimates of petty expenses for one month was neither attached to the request for 

initial PC advance.

The PC advances with incomplete documentation are as follows:

Communications Technology Group 

(ICTG) 

30,000.00 

02/07/2020 23984 For administrative expenses of the Office 

of the General Counsel (OGC)  

20,000.00 

Total  80,000.00 

 

Interview with the accounting personnel disclosed that the AFO no longer 

attached a certification from the chief accountant that the previous cash advances of 

the AOs have been liquidated because they claimed they have a monitoring 

schedule of cash advances, which could already determine whether an AO is clear 

from his/her previous cash advances. 

 

Nevertheless, the monitoring schedule that shows the AO is clear, certified by 

the Accountant should still be attached to the DVs, in compliance with the GAM, 

and for validation purposes. 

 

On the other hand, the need of the approved estimates of petty expenses for 

one month is to ensure that PCF would not go beyond the recurring expenses for 

one month as Section 35, Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM provides. 

 

b) PCF was way beyond the recurring expenses for one month 
 

Section 35 states that: 

 

The Petty Cash Fund (PCF) to be set up shall be sufficient for the 

recurring petty operating expenses of the agency for one month. 

xxx. The PCF shall be replenished as soon as disbursements reach 

at least 75% or as needed. 

 

Our verification of PCFs for CY 2020 showed that these were far beyond the 

recurring expenses for one month, contrary to Section 35.  

 

Data gathered showed that the average monthly utilization of the PCFs were 

from four (4) to 48 percent only per month, which meant that the PCFCs have in 

their possession a petty cash good for two or more months’ use, as shown below:

 *liquidation of PCF at year-end 

 

Due to the non-submission of approved estimates of petty expenses for one 

month, the PCF set-up was more than the recurring monthly expenses; hence, the 

fund under Ms. Guevara and Ms. Zamora went idle in their possession.  

 

Furthermore, the request for the additional P30,000.00 PCF for Katherine Jan 

F. Mejia in September 2020 was noted as not necessary since it is shown that the 

original PCF of P30,000.00 was not actually exhausted every month. The Director 

IV-AFO’s justification for his request was that his Office has six motor vehicles 

that are being used to transport GCG personnel from various designated pick-up 

points to GCG office and vice versa, as a support mechanism during the COVID-19 



40 

 

Pandemic; and the average fuel expenses per week is P15,000.00 which is half of 

the original amount of PCF.  However, the preceding Table showed that the only 

time that expenses went beyond the original P30,000.00 was in December 2020. 

 

Had they reviewed their monthly recurring petty operating expenses, they 

would have realized that the PCF is actually enough for their monthly use. 

 

c) Closing of PCFs at every year-end 
 

Section 35(b), Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM states that: 

 

The unused balance of the PCF shall not be closed/refunded at the 

end of the year. The fund shall be closed only upon termination, 

separation, retirement or dismissal of the Petty Cash Fund 

Custodian (PCFC), who in turn shall refund any balance to close 

his/her cash accountability; xxx 

 

Review and examination of the general ledger of the Petty Cash account 

revealed that the PCFs were liquidated/closed at every year-end, and that the 

unexpended amounts were refunded to the collecting officer, contrary to the afore-

cited Section 35(b). The details follow:  

 

PCF (P) Refunded/(Reimbursed) (P) 

Date  Amount  Liquidated  Date  OR No. Amount  

02/07/2020 30,000.00 17,662.00 11/26/2020 0369958 12,338.00 

02/07/2020 20,000.00 7,766.00 12/17/2020 0369961 12,234.00 

1/17/2020 60,000.00 57,514.53 12/22/2020 0369964 2,604.96 

09/14/2020     (119.49) 

 

Interview with the accounting personnel revealed that the closing of the PCFs 

at every year-end have been the practice of the agency in order to reconcile the 

accounting records with the budget records. 

 

The practice, however, is inconsistent with the GAM and involves 

unnecessary and circuitous works/procedures such as preparation of documents in 

the grant and closing of PCF.  

 

d) PCFCs were not properly bonded 
 

Section 101(2) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Section 7.1 of COA 

Circular 97-002, as amended by COA Circular No. 2006-005 mandate the need for 

a properly bonded accountable officer.  

 

Scrutiny of the approved application for bond of the PCFCs disclosed that the 

bonds of two PCFCs have expired/been cancelled before the end of the year and 



41 

 

were not renewed since the agency had decided to have only one PCFC instead of 

three. The two PCFCs are as follows:  

 

Name of the PCFC 
Amount of 

PCF (P) 
Risk No. 

Effective Date 

Bonding Cancellation 

Mary Rose A. Zamora 30,000.00 D3-B19-1346R 08/22/2019 08/22/2020 

Juliet Marie M. Guevara 20,000.00 D3-B19-1657R 10/10/2019 10/10/2020 

 

The PCFs were used only up to March 9, 2020 and September 2, 2020, 

respectively, but the PCFCs were not advised to liquidate or close their PCFs and 

refund the unused balance since these were no longer needed, and that their bond 

will no longer be renewed. As a consequence, the fund was put to risk of loss or 

misuse without the possibility of indemnification. 

 

The PCFs were liquidated only on the following dates: 

 

PCF (P) Refunded/(Reimbursed)  

Date  
Amount 

Granted 
Liquidated  Date  OR No. 

Amount 

(P) 

02/07/2020 30,000.00 17,662.00 11/26/2020 0369958 12,338.00 

02/07/2020 20,000.00 7,766.00 12/17/2020 0369961 12,234.00 

 

Bonding is a requirement for insuring the fidelity of a public officer, in the 

Fidelity Fund, for the faithful performance of all duties imposed upon him by law or 

for the faithful accounting of all funds and public properties coming into his 

possession, custody or control and the Fidelity Fund shall be available for replacing 

defalcations, shortages, unrelieved losses in the accounts of bonded public officers. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the:  

 

a. Chief Accountant to ensure that the grants of PC advances are supported 
with complete documentary requirement;  

 

b. Heads of offices that request PCF to review their monthly recurring 
petty operating expenses; hence, a realistic PCF sufficient for one 

month’s use would be set up; 

 

c. PCFCs and the Chief Accountant to observe the accounting policies in 
the utilization and liquidation of PCF as prescribed under Section 35(b), 

Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM and COA Circular 97-002; and  

 

d. Chairman to ensure that all AOs are properly bonded as required. 
 

 

 

 

 



42 

 

Management commented as follows:  

 

Incomplete documentation in the grant of PC advances 

a. A Certification from the Accountant that previous cash advances have been 
liquidated and accounted for in the books was not attached for reason that 

the AFO maintains a monitoring schedule of cash advances to determine 

whether an accountable officer is clear and/or has an outstanding balance to 

date. 

b. Approved estimates of petty cash expenses were not made and attached 
because PCFC used his/her judgment based on historical data and the 

recurrence of the previous year's expenses in determining the amount of 

cash advance requested. 

c. Despite the non-attachments of other documentary requirements. The 
Governance Commission is religiously updating its record and monitoring 

of cash advances and is committed to adhere on the prescribed significant 

policies for the proper utilization of the fund set by the COA. 

 

PCF was way beyond the recurring expenses for one month 

d. The PCFs has been replenished way too soon even though disbursements 
did not even reach at least 75% because of the GCG’s new work-

arrangement scheme. Personnel responsible for checking and validating 

expenses and the signatories may not be readily available or may have a 

different schedule to physically report in the office. Further, the 

Commission discourages use of e-signatures and the taking home of hard 

copies of financial documents which includes original copies of Official 

receipts. The turn-around time of the replenishment will really take time. 

Hence, the amount may seemingly beyond the recurring expense for a 

month but liquidating it ahead of time and before reaching 75% is necessary 

to avert a scenario where petty cash is not available and would negatively 

affect the daily operations of GCG. 

 

Closing of PCFs at every year-end 

e. The closing of the PCFs every year-end has been the practice of the 
Governance Commission for ease of reconciling the accounting records with 

the budget, for Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs) 

purposes required to be submitted to the DBM. 

f. Initially, petty cash advances are recorded and charged as representation 
expenses by the Budget and at the end of every year through the closing 

and/or liquidation of the PCFs, the budget records will be corrected based on 

the actual expenses incurred as per accounting adjustment and records. 

 

PCFC of the agency were not properly bonded 

g. The bonds of the two PCFCs have expired or were already cancelled and the 
Governance Commission does not have the intention to renew the same 

because the GCG has decided to maintain only one PCF. Considering the 

COVID-19 Pandemic, the use of the PCF has been affected, and the 



43 

 

monthly recurring petty operating expenses during the Enhance Community 

Quarantine (ECQ) of the year 2020 of the two PCFs have gradually 

decreased. 

h. Further, the bond of the two PCFCs were not renewed, they were verbally 
apprised about it and were advised to close the PCFs. However, the work 

from home arrangement hindered them in liquidating/closing the PCF at the 

earliest time. Without the bond, they will be accountable of any 

defalcations, shortages, or unrelieved losses.  

 

 

Undelivered ERP Software Solution 

 

2. Only 25 percent or P1,500,000.00 of the P6,000,000.00 contract for the 
procurement of ERP Software Solution was completed and delivered by the 

supplier within the stipulated period in the MOA and its approved extension, 

affecting GCG’s project targets in CY 2020 to enhance and improve the 

internal processes and the tracking of accurate information related to Human 

Resource and inventory control of the agency. 

 

Sections 3.1 and 3.2, Annex D of the 2016 RIRR of the RA No. 9184 

provides that:   

 

3.1. When the supplier fails to satisfactorily deliver goods under 

the contract within the specified delivery schedule, inclusive of 

duly granted time extensions, if any, the supplier shall be liable for 

damages for the delay and shall pay the procuring entity liquidated 

damages, not by way of penalty, an amount equal to one-tenth 

(1/10) of one percent (1%) of the cost of the delayed goods 

scheduled for delivery for every day of delay until such goods are 

finally delivered and accepted by the procuring entity concerned. 

 

3.2. The procuring entity need not prove that it has incurred actual 

damages to be entitled to liquidated damages. Such amount shall be 

deducted from any money due or which may become due to the 

supplier, or collected from any securities or warranties posted by 

the supplier, whichever is convenient to the procuring entity 

concerned. In no case shall the total sum of liquidated damages 

exceed ten percent (10%) of the total contract price, in which event 

the procuring entity concerned may rescind the contract and 

impose appropriate sanctions over and above the liquidated 

damages to be paid. 

 

As an institution that promotes good governance in the GOCC sector, GCG 

encourages the same thrust to its internal process and systems by applying the 

benefits of technology. Henceforth, the agency decided to acquire and implement an 



44 

 

ERP Software Solution in order to modernize and integrate its current internal 

processes particularly those under the AFO. 

 

In line with the agency’s approved Information Systems Strategic Plan (ISSP) 

2018-2020, the major objective of the ERP Software Solution is to achieve better 

and higher operational efficiency on its internal processes so that manpower 

relationship management can be improved. The use of an ERP Software Solution is 

expected to promote better workflow and efficiency in the delivery of services in an 

organization. 

 

This project covers the delivery, deployment, implementation, 

documentation, support and maintenance of an off-the-shelf ERP Software Solution 

that is compliant to the latest policies and issuances of the Philippine regulatory and 

statutory laws specifically government agencies such as the Civil Service 

Commission (CSC), National Privacy Commission (NPC), DBM, COA, and the 

DOF.  

 

The ERP Software Solution consists of the following integrated sub-systems: 

 

a. Human Resource Information System (HRIS); and 
b. Property Information and Management System (PIMS). 

 

On December 13, 2019, the GCG entered into a MOA with the DCI for the 

procurement of the ERP Software Solution amounting to P6,000,000.00. On the 

same day, the GCG issued the Notice to Proceed (NTP) and received by DCI on 

December 27, 2019.  

 

It was stated in Section 2.3.1 of the said MOA that the ERP Software 

Solution shall be completed within five months from the date stipulated in the NTP 

and may be extended upon agreement by both parties. 

  

Further, Section 3.2 provides that the DCI shall be paid with a fixed 

percentage of the contract price based on the Output/Miles and date of delivery.  

 

Our examination and verification of the DVs relative to the payments to DCI 

showed the following milestones equivalent to 25 percent of the project:

45 

 

Interview with the concerned officials disclosed that the DCI President and 

CEO, through a letter dated April 17, 2020, requested an extension of the project 

timeline because the DCI could not meet its deliverable for the third milestone due 

on April 24, 2020 and the subsequent deliverables because of the effect of the 

COVID-19 pandemic on the company and its personnel. The letter further indicated 

the need to discuss a feasible and workable schedule that would fit into the new 

work mode/arrangement/interaction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  

 

Relative thereto, the GCG Chairman, through a letter dated April 27, 2020, 

granted an extension until December 15, 2020 to complete the project, and an 

Addendum to that effect was executed on May 20, 2020. 

  

Before the target completion and delivery date of the ERP Software Solution, 

the DCI President and CEO pleaded to GCG, through a letter dated December 14, 

2020, to allow them to conduct a face-to-face User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with 

the end-users that was originally scheduled on December 9 but was cancelled due to 

a virus on their developed HRIS and PIMS applications; hence, the systems had to 

be rebuilt.  

 

The GCG Chairman agreed to the proposed new timeline submitted by the 

DCI, however, the GCG is constrained to impose liquidated damages (LD) for 

every day of delay until such deliverables are finally delivered and accepted by the 

GCG. Although the DCI appealed for the reconsideration of the LD explaining that 

the delay was not directly and solely due to their fault or omission and negligence 

but due to circumstances beyond their control, it was denied by GCG since the 

failure of DCI to deliver the project affected GCG’s target in 2020 to enhance and 

improve internal processes and the tracking of accurate information related to 

Human Resource and inventory control. 

 

Moreover, DCI has already been given adequate consideration to deliver the 

project.  

  

We recommended and Management agreed to require the:  

 

a. Chief Accountant to compute the corresponding LD against the DCI 
pursuant to Section 3.1, Annex D of the 2016 RIRR of the RA No. 9184, 

and ensure that the total amount of the LD shall not exceed 10 per cent 

of the total contract price, in which event the GCG may rescind the 

MOA and impose appropriate sanctions over and above the LD; 

 

b. Chief Accountant to deduct the LD from any amount due or which may 
become due to the DCI, or collect from any securities or warranties 

posted by the DCI, whichever is convenient to the GCG; and 

 

c. Director III/Chief of Staff of the Office of the Chairman to strictly 
monitor the completion and delivery of the ERP Software Solution.  



46 

 

Management commented that on March 18, 2021, the GCG Chairman in its 

reply to DCI letter dated February 11, 2021 denied the request of DCI to waive the 

imposition of liquidated damages for the reason that the failure of DCI to make the 

timely completion of the project affected GCG’s target in 2020 to enhance and 

improve internal processes and the tracking of accurate information related to 

Human Resource and inventory control. With the agency’s approval of DCI’s 

requests, DCI has already given adequate consideration to be able to comply with 

its deliverable to GCG.  

 

Management further commented that the ERP Software Solution is one of the 

major procurement projects of the GCG and a joint undertaking of the ICTG and 

the AFO, the latter being the end-user. A Technical Work Group (TWG) composed 

of representatives from the two offices mentioned was created to properly 

coordinate with DCI the realization of this project and recommend to the 

Commission Proper any action relative thereto. The progress of this project is 

regularly discussed during Management Committee meetings.   

 

 

Long Outstanding Accounts Payable not reverted to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) 

 

3. Of the Accounts Payable balance of P7,774,325.03, a total of P1,555,895.77 
have been outstanding for two years or more but were not reverted to the 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account of the General Fund, inconsistent with 

Section 1 of EO No. 87 dated August 13, 2019.  

 

Section 1 of EO No. 87 on reversion of documented Accounts Payable 

provides that:  

 

All documented accounts payable for fiscal year 2016 and years 

prior thereto shall be reverted to the Accumulated Surplus or 

Deficit of the General Fund, or the Cumulative Result of 

Operations of the National Government. Henceforth, all 

documented accounts payable which remain outstanding for at 

least two years, for which no actual administrative or judicial claim 

has been filed, shall be subject to automatic reversion.  

 

Furthermore, on March 8, 2021, the COA and the DBM issued JC No. 1, 

s.2021 prescribing the guidelines on the implementation of EO No. 87, which 

reiterates that all accounts payable that remained outstanding for two years or more 

in the books of the National Government Agencies (NGAs) be reverted to the 

Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund of the NGA.  

 

This observation on long outstanding accounts payable has already been 

pointed out in the CY 2018 Annual Audit Report (AAR) on GCG. It was 

recommended then that the long outstanding accounts payable amounting to 



47 

 

P305,158.50 be reverted to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account, which was 

complied with by the Accountant. 

 

However, based on our review and examination of the Aging of Accounts 

Payable as at December 31, 2020, we discovered a total of P1,555,895.77 that have 

been outstanding for two years or more, out of the Accounts Payable balance of 

P7,774,325.03, for which no actual administrative or judicial claim has been filed, 

but were not reverted to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account of the General 

Fund as required by Section 1 of the EO No. 87. 

 

The details of the long outstanding accounts payable due for reversal are as 

follows:  

 

Name of Creditor Date Particulars 
Amount 

(P) 

Skycable Corporation 12/31/2017 Internet Services  1,260,000.00

Mandatory Continuing Legal 

Education (MCLE) 

180,000.00 

Total    1,555,895.77 

 

The failure of the Chief Accountant to revert the long outstanding accounts 

payable is inconsistent with Section 1 of EO No. 87. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant to revert the accounts payable totaling P1,555,895.77 to the 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account in compliance with Section 1 of EO No. 

87.  
 

Management commented that the GCG thru its Finance Division sent an e-

mail on April 7, 2021 to all the concerned end-users reminding and advising them 

to notify their respective supplier of goods and/or services with outstanding 

balances of more than two years that they need to submit the complete supporting 

documents for them to be able to collect payment from GCG. 

 

Management further commented that the Accounts Payable due for reversal 

were already relayed to the respective GCG offices and informed them that 

although the services and goods have been delivered and fulfilled by the supplier/s, 

the DV were either not yet forwarded to the Finance Division resulting in the delay 

of payment or the DV has incomplete supporting documents. 

 

In addition, Management commented during the exit conference on April 21, 

2021 that the material amount in the Accounts Payable pertains to Sky Cable 



48 

 

Corporation which do have some documentary requirements issue and that the 

Finance Division is still waiting for the legal opinion of the GCG’s legal division 

because there was a transfer/assignment agreement between Inter-island

individual or group of accounts which balances remained non-moving for more than 

five years. Section III.A.10 of the said circular, provides for the write-off of 

dormant accounts, to wit: 

 

If the analysis/review of the accounts/funds is not possible due to 

absence of records and documents, the agency head concerned 

should request for write-off and/or adjustment of account balances 

from the COA, supported by: 

 

10.1. List of available records and extent of validation made on 
the accounts; and 

10.2. Certification and reasons why the books of 
accounts/records, financial statements/schedules and 

supporting vouchers/ documents cannot be located. 

 

Further, Section III.B of the same Circular requires the Chief Accountant to

accounts in the trial balance, and prepare the adjusting journal entry for the 

settlement of all liabilities and/or reversion/adjustment of same to the Cumulative 

Results of Operations (Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account, if necessary.

Interview with the accounting personnel disclosed that as at audit date there is 

neither request for refund of performance security deposit nor request for release of 

retention fee from the above-mentioned suppliers/contractors. 

 

The Audit Team gathered that the performance security deposit of Isla Lipana 

and Company amounting to P600,000.00 was not yet requested for refund because 

the fulfillment by the supplier of its purpose is still on-going.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant to:  

 

a. review and analyze the dormant guaranty/security deposits, and 
determine, through confirmation letters, whether their purpose have 

already been fulfilled by the suppliers/contractors; 

 

b. henceforth, inform the suppliers/contractors to request for the 
refund/release of the guaranty/security deposits supported with complete 

documentation; and 

 



50 

 

c. request for authority to write-off if justified, strictly in accordance with 
the requirements of COA Circular 97-001. 

 

Management commented that GCG’s Finance Division sent an e-mail on 

April 12, 2021 to the concerned GCG end-users to validate and confirm the status 

of their respective projects or supplies and/or services versus the long and dormant 

outstanding guaranty/security deposits, informing them that the Finance Division 

needs to be informed of the status of the deliverables and if the purpose of the 

guaranty/security deposits have already been fulfilled. 

 

Further, the Management commented that GCG is cognizant of the economic 

situation of businesses brought about by the COVID-19 Pandemic. The Finance 

Division instructed the end-users to remind their respective suppliers that if the 

project or activity has been completed and delivered to GCG, the said suppliers may 

request for refund or release of the guaranty/security deposit which will be 

processed by the Finance Division. This is to give a final reminder and opportunity 

to suppliers to request the same and may help their business during this 

unprecedented time.

Development Plan (2017-2022). 

 

Moreover, the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 

agency, which shall be at least five per cent of their budgets. For this purpose, 

activities currently being undertaken by the agency which relate to GAD or those 

that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of 

marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human 

rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient 

compliance with said requirements. 

 

Evaluation of the submitted GAD accomplishment report for CY 2020 

showed that GCG had formulated a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues for 

FY 2020 through integration in the Agency’s regular activities and spent a total cost 

of P3,100,776.99, which represents 1.70 percent of its total agency budget of

of 2020 and the GAD 

activities resumed only 

during the second 

semester of 2020. 

          Total 605,000.00 3,100,776.99  

 

The preceding table shows that out of the 13 programmed activities of GCG 

for CY 2020, eight were implemented, four were partially implemented and one 

was not implemented.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to:  

 

a. strictly adhere with Section 31 of the GP of the GAA and ensure to 
allocate at least five per cent of its total budget in order to provide more 

comprehensive and responsive GAD plans and programs; and  



56 

 

b. endeavor to accomplish all programmed activities.   
 

Management commented during the exit conference on April 21, 2021 that the 

GAD activities were halted for the most part of the first semester of CY 2020 when 

Metro Manila was placed under ECQ and Modified ECQ because of the effect of 

COVID-19 Pandemic which requires the government offices to have work from 

home arrangement. Nevertheless, the GAD-TWG were still able to accomplish 

almost all programmed activities stated in its CY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget.  

 

Further commented that for CY 2021, the GAD-TWG have crafted activities 

that are doable even during a work from home arrangement. Also, they plan to 

continue its series of capacity building activities for its members to properly plan 

and implement activities that will ensure the allocation of at least five per cent of 

GCG’s total budget in order to provide a more comprehensive and responsive GAD 

plans and programs. Currently, aside from capacity building activities, they are also 

in partnership with several offices and committees in GCG for the implementation 

of certain projects wherein gender mainstreaming are incorporated. Among which 

are the collection of Sex Disaggregated Data (SDD) project in partnership with two 

major offices in GCG – the Corporate Governance Office (CGO) and Corporate 

Standards Office (CSO); the Creation of Committee on Decorum and Investigation 

(CODI) in partnership with the Disciplinary Action Committee; and several 

proposed projects in partnership with the Human Capital Management Division 

(HCMD) and GCG Employee Association (EA). 

 

 

Programs and Projects Related to Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability (PWD) 

 

9. For CY 2020, GCG has no actual or direct projects/activities relative Senior 
Citizens and PWD, although, these were considered in the plans of the AFO, 

however, these were not pursued because of the effect of the COVID-19 

Pandemic and the implementation of the community quarantines.  

 

32 of the GP of the GAA of FY 2020 (RA No. 11465) provides that “xxx. All 

agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended 

to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it 

relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular 

activities.” 

 

The agency ensures to give priority to Senior Citizens, PWD, and Pregnant 

Women through posting reminders at our front desk that priority service shall be 

given to them. There is also a dedicated room with appliances provision for 

lactating mothers. Moreover, the BDO towers have provisions for senior citizen 

clients of GCG such as the use of elevators and wheelchairs.

Management sends memorandum to its employees via email to remind them about 

their participation in the fire drills, earthquake drills, and other disaster-related 

memorandums. GCG employees were also issued emergency supplies or survival 

kits that can be used during disasters. Moreover, the GCG premises, vehicles, and 

property equipment have been insured under the GSIS to mitigate losses and ensure 

that the GCG is compensated for any loss. 

 

Due to the present circumstances plaguing the nation, the COVID-19 

Pandemic has been considered in the Enterprise Risk Management tool of the 

agency.  On this note, several actions were initiated by the AFO to mitigate the risk 

brought about by the pandemic, among which are the implementation of: (a) the 

Alternative Work Arrangement; (b) shuttle service for GCG employees which are 

required to physically report in the Office; (c) weekly health survey of GCG
