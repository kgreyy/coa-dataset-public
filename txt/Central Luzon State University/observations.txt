PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

 The audit of the accounts and financial transactions of the Central Luzon State 

University (CLSU) for calendar year 2020 disclosed certain observations that needed 

corrections and/or improvements. Our observations with the corresponding 

recommendations are discussed in detail in the succeeding paragraphs. 

 

Financial and Compliance Audit 

 

Unreliable PPE balance -₱1,574,018,596.26 

 

1. The Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts with carrying value of 
₱1,574,018,596.26 as of December 31, 2020 were unreliable due to (a) incomplete 

conduct of inventory-taking of PPE with only 16.25% actually counted; (b) unresolved 

variance amounting to ₱87,563,734.12 in the balances between the books and inventory 

report; and (c) inclusion of unserviceable items under the PPE totaling to ₱5,829,240.50 

which were not reported to the Accounting Office thru the Inventory and Inspection 

Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) as basis for the derecognition thereof in the 

books of the University, as required under Section 40(d), Chapter 10 of the Government 

Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. 

 

1.1 The Statement of Financial Position (SFP) as of December 31, 2020 showed 
Property Plant and Equipment (PPE) with carrying value of ₱1,574,018,596.26, 

representing 73.17% of the total net assets of ₱2,151,142,235.48 of the University.  

 

1.2 Verification of the Schedule of PPE obtained from the Accounting Office and the 
Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as of December 

31, 2020 submitted by the Property and Supply Office disclosed the following audit 

observations: 

 

a) The Property Office was only able to conduct partial actual inventory taking of the 
PPE located at the Research, Extension and Training (RET) Office and at the General 

Administration and Support Services (GASS) Office for an estimated completion rate of 

16.25%. 

 

1.3 On January 21, 2021, the Property and Supplies Office (PSO) submitted the 
RPCPPE. Using the random sampling method, the Audit Team validated various PPEs as 

reported; however, there were no signatures or marks in the property tags to indicate that 

the items were actually counted. Accordingly, the personnel who conducted the inventory-

taking counted the PPEs thru ocular inspection only and that they were not able to sign the 

tags as proof of counting. Further, the personnel who conducted the inventory-taking 

informed the Audit Team that the count was completed at 40% only of the PPEs located at 

the RET Offices and 25% of the expected number of PPEs at the GASS Offices. No PPEs 

were inventoried at the Academic Affairs Offices and classrooms and at the University 

Business Affairs Program (UBAP) Offices; thus, an accomplishment of only 16.25% out 

of the total inventoriable PPEs of the University. 



50 

 

1.4 Interview with the Officials concerned and as noted by the Audit Team during 
validation, the skeletal work force scheme of University officials and the blended distance 

learning of both students and faculty members slowed down the conduct of actual inventory 

count. 

 

1.5 The Handbook on Property and Supply Management System provides that in all 
cases, the physical inventory taking which is required semi-annually or annually should be 

regarded with importance. It serves as a basis for preparing accounting reports. At the end 

of each quarter the Accounting and the Supply/Property unit should reconcile their 

records. 

 

1.6 Moreover, Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, requires that 
the entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and 

presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment 

(RPCPPE) (Appendix 71) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the 

Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at 

station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting 

Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording. 

 

1.7 Actual inventory taking is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of 
property custodianship and accuracy of the reported PPE balance in the books of accounts; 

hence, non-compliance thereto rendered the year-end carrying value of ₱1,574,018,596.26   

in the financial statements (FS) uncertain. 

      

b) Unreconciled balances between the books and inventory report - ₱87.56 million 
 

1.8 Section 42, Chapter 10 of the same Manual provides that: 
 

Sec. 42. Accounting and Property Records to be maintained for PPE. The 

Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE 

including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to 

record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, 

depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the 

asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall 

likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and 

disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC 

maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled 

with other property records like PAR. (Underscoring supplied) 

 

1.9 The balances of the PPE account per RPCPPE did not reconcile with the book 
balances showing a discrepancy of ₱ 87,563,734.12 as shown below:

1.10  The importance of reconciliation is to ensure that the PPEs in the accounting 
records actually exist and that all PPEs in the RPCPPE are recorded in the books of 

accounts. The non-reconciliation of both records and the incomplete inventory-taking, as 

discussed above, added to the uncertainty of the reported balance of PPE.  

 

c) Unserviceable equipment and other PPE accounts - ₱5.8 million 
 

1.11 This is a reiteration of the previous year’s audit observation. 
 

1.12 Section 40(d), Chapter 10, of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 
National Government Agencies, Volume I, provides that all unserviceable property shall 

be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP). 

PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-

Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation). 

 

1.13 Review of the Schedule of PPE from the Accounting Office revealed that most of 
the unserviceable items found during the ocular inspection and validation conducted by the 

Audit Team in the previous year were still in the books of accounts, thus, the reiteration of 

the observation. 

 

1.14 In addition to the unserviceable machinery and equipment which were already 
recommended to be disposed in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report (AAR), the Audit Team 

found various equipment under the Agricultural and Forestry Equipment account that were 

unserviceable as of December 31, 2020. Details of which are shown below:

53 

 

1.15 The details per classification of the unserviceable items found during the 
inspection/validation conducted by the Audit Team are presented in Appendix A. 

 

1.16 We recommended and the University President agreed to require the (a) Chief, 
Property and Supply Office to (i) prioritize the conduct and reporting of the results 

of annual physical inventory-taking of PPE as the basis of the Accounting Unit to 

correct the reported balances in the Financial Statements, as warranted; and (ii) 

prepare another IIRUP for the items of PPE, with total carrying value of 

₱5,829,240.50, which were identified as unserviceable/beyond economic repair and 

due for disposal as of December 31, 2020; and (b) the Chief, Accounting Office to (i) 

secure from the Property and Supply Office, copy of the IIRUP to support the 

derecognition in the books as at year-end of newly identified items of unserviceable 

PPEs; and (ii) undertake monthly reconciliation of property records maintained by 

the Property and Supply Office for each item of PPE as basis of adjustment in the 

books, whenever necessary, to update the PPE account every reporting period. 

 

1.17 The Chief of the Property and Supply Office explained during the Exit Conference 
that they were not able to complete the conduct of inventory-taking due to the adoption of 

Work from Home (WFH) Scheme of the faculty members under the University’s 

Alternative Work Arrangement (AWA). The University President agreed to issue a 

Memorandum providing a schedule of reporting by the faculty members to the Office to 

facilitate the inventory-taking per college, and assured the Audit Team to finish the 

inventory by the end of the year 2021.  

 

1.18 On the other hand, Management committed to undertake the reconciliation between 
the balances of the accounting and property records, and assessment of the serviceability 

of the identified items of PPE within a period of three months or by the end of May 2021. 

 

Misstatement of Biological Assets- ₱11,175,650.89 

 

2. The reported balance of Biological Assets of ₱11,175,650.89 as at year-end was 
misstated due to (a) non-recognition of 2,890 units of matured fruit-bearing mango trees 

estimated at ₱15,650,000.00; (b) non-dropping from the books of accounts of the costs 

of dead and sold goats, sheep and swine totaling to ₱1,973,322.00; (c) misclassification 

of the laying hens under the Poultry Module Program costing ₱720,408.30 to the 

Inventories account instead of Biological Assets; (d) non-recognition of purchases of 

additional hens as well as sales and deaths resulting in the net overstatement of assets 

by ₱250,855.70; and (e) non-adjustment of the account for the reduced fair values of the 

remaining 37 heads of imported sheep totaling to ₱1,475,856.00, contrary to the 

provisions of Chapter 11 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 

Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, in relation to International Public Sector 

Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 27. 

 

2.1 Chapter 11 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 
Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, prescribes the standards, policies, procedures 



54 

 

and guidelines in the recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure 

requirements of agricultural activity provided under IPSAS 27 – Agriculture. 

 

2.2 As of December 31, 2020, the University reported biological assets totaling to 
₱11,175,650.89, composed of the following:

Total ₱35,000.00 ₱9,992,288.00 ₱1,148,362.89 ₱11,175,650.89 

 

2.3 Review and validation of the Quarterly Report of Biological Assets (QRBA) 
submitted by the Property and Supply Office (PSO) and the University Business Affairs 

Program (UBAP) Office, as well as the Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) maintained by the 

Accounting Office revealed the following deficiencies: 

 

a) Non-recognition of 2,890 units of matured fruit-bearing mango trees - ₱15.65 
Million 

 

2.4  Section 6, Chapter 11 (Agriculture) of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides 
that: 

 

Section 6. Recognition. An entity shall recognize a biological asset or 

agricultural produce when and only when: 

 

a. The entity controls the asset as a result of past events; 
 

In agricultural activity, control may be evidenced by, for example, legal 

ownership of cattle and the branding or otherwise marking of the cattle 

on acquisition, birth, or weaning. 

 

b. It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated 
with the asset will flow to the entity; and 

 

The future benefits or service potential are normally assessed by 

measuring the significant physical attributes. 

 

c. The fair value or cost of the asset can be measured reliably. (Par. 13, 
IPSAS 27) (Emphasis supplied) 

 

2.5 The above observation was already reported in the previous years’ Annual Audit 

Reports (AARs). Notwithstanding, based on the new information gathered and validated 

by the Audit Team and the results of interview with key officials, we noted that there were 

more or less 2,890 fully grown mango trees (20 years old or more) inside the campus valued 



55 

 

at a minimum estimated amount of ₱15,000.00 per tree for the century trees and ₱5,000.00 

for the non-century trees, or a total estimated fair value of ₱15,650,000.00; to wit:

TOTAL ₱ 15,650,000.00  

 

2.6 As of December 31, 2020, the UBAP had already completed the inventory-taking 

of mango trees as recommended by the Audit Team in CY 2019 and reported the quantities 

shown in the table above. However, validation by the Audit Team disclosed that they were 

able to count and tag only those trees that are under their direct supervision. Accordingly, 

various trees with a total estimated quantity of 1,641 are under the supervision of the 

Agricultural Science and Technology School (ASTS), Research Office, various Colleges, 

Housing, and those along the Fishponds as enumerated in the table above. As such, the 

mango trees outside of UBAP’s jurisdiction were not included in the inventory count. 

 

2.7 Interview with two University Officials at the UBAP Office who have personal 

knowledge of the existing trees showed that all trees are more than 20 years old and 120 of 

which are more or less a century old with a lowest estimated fair value of around ₱5,000.00 

and ₱15,000.00, respectively. 

 

2.8 The UBAP, being the primary arm of the University to take care of its Business 

Affairs, and as mandated under Section 1, Article 80, Chapter 5 of the CLSU University 

Code to pursue a sustainable and competitive income generating program for Central 

Luzon State University utilizing its resources and developing entrepreneurial capabilities 

of faculty, staff and students and other development partners, should take responsibility of 

all the aforesaid trees to maximize their income potentials and uphold the accountability 

for each mango tree. This can be accomplished in conjunction with the research and 

academic use of the mango trees, if the need arises, since the functions of the UBAP include 

complementation activities with the three major programs of the University. 

 

2.9 The non-recording of these trees resulted in the understatement of the reported 

assets of the University for CY 2020 by at least ₱15,650,000.00. Such practice is a 

departure from the recognition policy stated in the GAM of NGAs, Volume I. 

 



56 

 

2.10 Moreover, the continuous practice of utilizing the mango trees as resources in the 

income generating projects of various offices and colleges of the CLSU other than the 

UBAP was a deviation from the mandates of the University. This may subsequently result 

in the non-maximization of income potential and expose the funds from sales of the 

harvests to possible loss or misuse. 

 

b. Non-derecognition in the books of the dead and sold goat, sheep and swine - ₱1.97 
Million 

 

2.11 The subsidiary ledgers (SLs) maintained by the Accounting Office revealed that the 

costs of dead goats, sheep and swine totaling to ₱953,106.00 (Appendix B) and sold 

Biological Assets amounting to ₱1,020,216.00 (Appendix C) were not yet derecognized in 

the books of accounts. 

 

2.12 The disclosures made by the Management in the Notes to Financial Statements (FS) 

on the changes in the carrying amount of breeding stocks were related only to the purchases 

made and the COA decisions for relief of accountability for the loss of Biological Assets. 

This, however, is not in conformity with the accrual basis of accounting which states that 

the transactions and events are recorded in the accounting records and recognized in the 

financial statements of the periods to which they relate. 

 

2.13 Relatedly, Section 41 (b), Chapter 10 (Property, Plant, and Equipment) of the GAM 

for NGAs, Volume I, requires that Lost property and the related accumulated depreciation 

and impairment loss shall be derecognized in the books upon receipt of the Report of Lost, 

Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) (Appendix 75) supported by a Notice of 

Loss prepared and submitted by the Accountable Officer. 

 

2.14 In view of the foregoing, for the sale of livestock, the related cost must be 

recognized upon recognition of the revenue. Meanwhile, for the loss of livestock and/or 

breeding stocks through death, the cost of the biological asset and any accumulated gains 

or impairment losses shall be derecognized in the books  and  the receivable from the officer 

accountable shall be set up from the time of the notification of loss. If the request for relief 

from accountability is granted, the receivable from the officer accountable is reverted or 

else, impose the payment of the receivable if not granted. 

 

2.15 The non-reduction of the fair value of livestock already sold or lost thru death 

aggregating to ₱1,973,322.00 from the ending balance of Biological Assets bloated the 

reported Assets of the University by the same amount as of year-end. 

 

c) Non-recognition of purchased, sold and dead layer chickens as well as effects of the 

changes in fair values for CY 2020- ₱250,855.70 

 

2.16 Further scrutiny of the SL disclosed that the year-end balance of the account 

Agricultural Produce for Distribution amounting to ₱971,264.40 as of December 31, 2020 

under the Fund No. 06207512. Further verification showed that this pertained to the fair 

value of 5,952 units of layer hens which remained unadjusted since January 1, 2020, despite 



57 

 

the changes in the quantity due to purchases, sales, death, and changes in fair value of the 

layer chickens in CY 2020; to wit:

2.17 Section 2 (c), Chapter 11 (Agriculture) of the aforementioned Manual defines 

Bearer Biological Assets as biological assets that are used repeatedly or continuously for 

more than one year in an agricultural activity. Bearer biological assets are not agricultural 

produce but, rather, are self-regenerating. Example, livestock from which milk is 

produced, grape vines, fruit trees, and trees from which firewood is harvested while the 

tree remains. (Par. 40, IPSAS 27) 

 

2.18 Moreover, Section 7, Chapter 11 (Agriculture) of the same Manual provides that A 

biological asset shall be measured on initial recognition and at each reporting date at its 

fair value less costs to sell, except where market-determined prices or values are not 

available, and for which alternative estimates of fair value are determined to be clearly 

unreliable. In such a case, that biological asset shall be measured at its cost less any 

accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. (Pars. 16 and 34, 

PPSAS 27) 

 

2.19 Verification of the Accounting records showed that 4,551 heads of laying hens 

valued at ₱720,408.30 were misclassified under the Inventories account, specifically 

Agricultural Produce for Distribution. 

 

2.20 While the above misclassification had no effect on the reported balances, the non-

recognition of the cost of layer chickens purchased, sold and died amounting to 

₱112,000.00, ₱103,062.00, and ₱181,134.30, respectively, as well as the changes in the 

fair value of the growing layer chickens during the year resulted to a total overstatement in 

the reported Assets of the University by ₱250,855.70, as shown in the table above.  

 

d) Non-adjustment for the reduced fair value of the imported sheep - ₱1.47 Million 
 

2.21 The same observation was already noted in the CY 2018 AAR. However, the 

Accounting Unit still failed to record the changes in the fair value of the said assets; hence, 

the reiteration of the observation. 

 

2.22 Out of the 51 heads of the imported sheep transferred to the Small Ruminant Center 
(seven heads died and seven heads were sold), the remaining 37 alive sheep were still 

reported in the Assets of the University at its import price of ₱99,888.00 per head which, 



58 

 

according to the latest Report of Biological Assets, has only a fair value of ₱60,000.00 per 

head.  Applying this current fair value, the book value for Biological Assets was overstated 

by ₱39,888.00 per head or a total of ₱1,475,856.00. 

 

2.23 In view of the foregoing observations, we recommended and the University 

President agreed to instruct the (a) Manager of the Nursery, Pomology, and Orchard 

project to continue the actual counting and tagging of all mango trees inside the 

campus and submit to the Accounting Office a complete report thereto, including 

valuation, for recording in the books of accounts; and (b) the Accounting Office to (i) 

derecognize in the books the recorded values of sold and dead goat, sheep and swine  

totaling to ₱1,973,322.00 and recognize the corresponding receivables from the 

person accountable thereto; (ii) reclassify the laying hens recorded as inventories into 

the proper Biological Assets account; (iii) recognize the value of sold laying hens and 

those that had died, as well as the changes in the fair value of the biological assets to 

correct the overstatement of ₱250,855.70 in the reported Biological Assets account; 

(iv) update the reported values of the laying hens to their current fair value; (v) adjust 

the Biological Assets account for the reduction in value of the remaining 37 heads of 

imported sheep calculated at ₱1,475,856.00; and (vi) ensure that all transactions 

related to the Biological Assets  account for the current year and the ensuing years 

are properly accounted for. 

 

2.24 During the exit conference, the University President agreed to instruct the UBAP 

Office to conduct the inventory-taking and actual tagging of all trees under the supervision 

of different offices. Moreover, a Memorandum dated March 5, 2021 was issued declaring 

that the operation and management of all the mango trees shall be transferred to the UBAP. 

 

2.25 Regarding the death of biological assets, the Chief, Accounting Office said that 

they were not furnished with copies of the notices of loss. The Chief, Property and Supply 

Office added that the corresponding notice of loss and supporting documents were already 

submitted to the Auditor’s Office, and they are waiting for the decision from COA before 

furnishing the Accounting Office with a copy thereof. Both offices expressed willingness 

to change their practices and implement the audit recommendations. 

 

 

Understatement of Receivables-₱539,886.23  

  

3. Accounts Receivable with a year-end balance of ₱3,169,414.02 was understated 
by ₱539,886.23 due to non-recognition of receivables from electricity, water, rentals and 

garbage billings that were incurred for the month of December 2020, contrary to the 

policy on accrual basis of accounting set out under the International Public Sector 

Accounting Standard (IPSAS) 1 and as defined under Section 2.a, Chapter 2 of the 

Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), 

Volume I. 

  

3.1 Paragraph 1 (PAG1) of the International Public Sector Accounting Standard 
(IPSAS) 1 pronounces that Generally, the International Public Sector Accounting 



59 

 

Standards is on accrual basis except for transactions otherwise accounted for as required 

by law. 

 

3.2 Section 2, paragraph a, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) 
for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, provides the following definition 

of accrual basis of accounting:  

 

Accrual basis – means a basis of accounting under which transactions 

and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when 

cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions 

and events are recognized in the accounting records and recognized in 

the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. The elements 

recognized under accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net 

assets/equity, revenue and expenses. 

 

3.3 During the year 2019, the Audit Team already noted the same observation and 
recommended that the Credit and Collection Office (CCO) be required to facilitate an 

earlier preparation of the monthly Statement of Accounts Receivable from electricity, 

water, rentals and garbage fees of consumers/tenants and the submission thereof to the 

Accounting Office. 

 

3.4 However, review of the Monthly Schedule of Receivables for CY 2020 furnished 
to the Audit Team by the CCO under the University Business Affairs Program (UBAP) 

disclosed that the submission was still very much behind the required period of reporting. 

As such, the Accounting Office was not able to post the relative transactions in the 

respective subsidiary ledgers (SLs) of the consumers/tenants for electricity and water bills 

as well as for rentals and garbage fees notwithstanding the closing of the Accounting books 

and subsequent rendition of the FS to the Audit Team on February 9, 2021. 

 

3.5 Validation of the reported Accounts Receivable, net of Impairment Loss in the 
agency’s Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020, revealed that the ledger 

balance of ₱3,169,414.02 did not include the amounts due from consumers/tenants for 

electricity, water, rentals and garbage fees for the month of December 2020 in the sum of 

₱539,886.23, broken down as follows: 

 
Particulars Amount 

Electricity ₱ 494,817.96 

Water 5,600.79 

Rentals 39,187.48 

Garbage 280.00 

Total ₱ 539,886.23 

  

3.6 Accordingly, the non-accrual of these receivables was attributable to the non-
submission of the report on billed receivables from the University Business Affairs 

Program Credit and Collection Unit (UBAPCCU). To our mind, a period of one month 

before the close of December is ample enough for the UBAPCCU to prepare/verify the 

bills, and subsequently submit a report to the Accounting Office for accrual/recognition in 



60 

 

the books. On the contrary, the transactions pertaining to CY 2020 were taken up in the 

succeeding year.  

 

3.7 The non-recording of the aforementioned receivables in the proper period to which 
these relate was not in conformity with IPSAS 1 and the aforementioned provision of 

Section 2, paragraph a, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, which understated the 

Accounts Receivable by ₱539,886.23. 
 

3.8 In view of the foregoing observations, we reiterated our recommendation and 
the University President agreed to require the (a) Chief, Credit and Collection Office 

of the UBAP to facilitate an earlier preparation of the monthly Statement of Accounts 

Receivable from electricity, water, rentals and garbage fees of consumers/tenants and 

the submission thereof to the Accounting Office before the distribution of the 

individual Billing Statements to the respective consumers/tenants; and (b) the Chief, 

Accounting Office to ensure the updated posting of receivables to their respective 

subsidiary accounts. 

 

3.9 During the exit conference, the Chief Accountant informed the Audit Team that an 
arrangement with the UBAP office had been made for the simultaneous submission of the 

billing statements and the schedule of Accounts Receivable to give the Accounting office 

ample time for the posting of the receivables to each subsidiary ledger (SL). 

 

 

Inaccurate balance of Due to NGAs account 

 

4. Accounting errors and lapses were committed in the recording of fund transfers 
to the Due to NGAs account such as (a) non-recognition of the return of funds to source 

agencies and non-adjustment of erroneous ledger balances of completed and ongoing 

research projects resulting to an overstatement of ₱3,812,633.91 ; (b) doubtful accuracy 

in the balances of 168 projects with an aggregate amount of ₱352,807,957.36 due to 

discrepancies between the accounting records and the summary of expenditures for each 

project and lack of supporting documents; and (c) dormant unutilized balances of 98 

completed projects totaling to ₱10,849,968.4 in the custody of the University, depriving 

the national government of the much-needed funds for its priority programs, which 

practices are contrary to Section 10 of the General Provisions of the General 

Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year 2020 and Paragraph 6.7 of COA Circular No. 

94-013 dated December 13, 1994.  

 

4.1 The Central Luzon State University (CLSU) is one of the premier institutions of 
agriculture in the country known for its research in aquatic culture, ruminant, and crops. 

As such, the bulk of its annual cash inflows includes Inter Agency Transferred Funds 

(IATF) from various National Government Agencies (NGAs) for the funding of research 

related projects. These IATFs are recognized as fiduciary funds which are recorded under 

Fund No. 07308601 or the Trust Fund account of the University. 

 



61 

 

4.2 Records showed that as of December 31, 2020, the balance of the IATFs is as 
follows:

4.5 Review of the SL balances and supporting documents of the individual projects 
under clusters 3, 5, and 7 in the matrix above showed that all 98 projects were already 

completed but the aggregate reported balance of ₱10,849,968.47 was not returned to the 

SA or owner of fund as required. 

 

4.6 Section 10 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for 
Fiscal Year 2020 provides that: 

  

Reversion, Closure, and Transfer of Balances of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or 

Trust Funds, Revolving Funds, and Unauthorized Accounts. Departments, bureaus, 

offices, and instrumentalities of the National Government, including Constitutional 

Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs are mandated to close and revert all 

balances of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust Funds, and Revolving Funds to 

the General Fund in any of the following instances: (i) when there are no legal 

basis for the creation; (ii) when their terms have expired; or (iii) when they are no 

longer necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which said funds were 

established.  

 

In case an agency fails or refuses to implement such closure, reversion or transfer, 

the Permanent Committee may recommend for approval of the President the 



63 

 

closure, reversion or transfer of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust Funds, 

Revolving Funds and Unauthorized Accounts, as the case may be, on any 

applicable grounds, to wit: (i) in the cases above-mentioned; (ii) when used in 

violation of the rules and regulations issued by the Permanent Committee; (iii) 

when they have remained dormant for an unreasonable length of time; or (iv) when 

needed by the General Fund in times of emergency. (Underscoring supplied) 

 

4.7 COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 provides the “Rules and 
Regulations in the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of Funds Transferred to 

Implementing Agencies”. Item 6.7 thereof requires that one of the duties and 

responsibilities of an Implementing Agency is to Return to the SA any unused balance and 

refund of disallowance upon completion of the project. 

 

4.8 Moreover, verification of the signed MOA between the University and the funding 
agencies disclosed that part of the stipulated responsibility of the University as the 

implementing agency is the submission of an annual or semi-annual financial report duly 

verified by the Audit Team together with the liquidation and accomplishment reports and 

the refund of all unutilized balances, if any, upon completion of the projects. 

 

4.9 Interview with the University Accountant and the Bookkeeper in charge of these 
projects disclosed that the errors noted in clusters 3 and 4 above were either due to incorrect 

recording or posting of transactions to the SL accounts or discrepancies incurred in the 

expenses reported by the Project staff. While those projects in cluster 7 pertains to old 

projects with dormant unutilized balances which could not be verified due to absence of 

supporting documents. Meanwhile, the projects in cluster 8 are newly granted projects, the 

supporting documents of which were not submitted yet to the Audit Team.  

 

4.10 Furthermore, the Audit Team noted that various errors were not detected on time 
due to the late submission of the required Audited Financial Statements or Liquidation 

Reports and the attendant summary of expenditures of completed and ongoing projects. It 

has been the practice of the project managers to submit the same when the projects are fully 

completed or when the funding agencies called their attention. 

 

4.11 To sum up, the failure of the University Accountant to recognize the refunds of 
unutilized balances of 21 projects to the SAs totaling to ₱2,073,527.51 overstated the Due 

to NGAs account balance by that amount as at year-end. Similarly, an overstatement was 

incurred for the non-adjustment of the SLs of 22 projects amounting to ₱1,739,106.40 

which reflected zero balances based on the summary of expenses prepared by the 

Bookkeeper. On the aggregate, the Liability account of the University was overstated by 

₱3,812,633.91. In addition, the inconsistencies found between the SL balances and the 

summary of expenditures of 168 projects totaling to ₱352,807,957.36 cast doubt on the 

accuracy of the reported balance of the account Due to NGAs as of December 31, 2020. 

 

4.12 Lastly, the non-return of unutilized fund balances of ₱10,849,968.47 from 98 
completed projects, which have remained dormant and idle in the bank account of the 



64 

 

University for more than two years, deprived the National Government of the productive 

use of the funds for other priority programs.  

 

4.13 We recommended and the Management agreed to instruct the University 
Accountant to (a) adjust the subsidiary ledger (SL) balances of projects for fully 

liquidated funds and refunds already made to source agencies in order to correct the 

overstatement of the Liabilities account in the Financial Statements; (b) coordinate 

with project managers of completed and ongoing projects to reconcile the 

inconsistencies noted in the reported ending balances; (c) furnish the Audit Team 

with copies of the MOA, LIB, NTP, and other supporting documents of the projects 

identified in clusters 7 and 8 as presented in the table above; (d) prepare the necessary 

documents for the return of all unutilized/dormant fund balances of completed 

projects to the source agencies or to the National Treasury, where appropriate; and 

(e) require the project managers to strictly comply with the timely preparation and 

submission of the annual or semi-annual financial reports as required in the MOA. 

 

 

Losses of property not properly reported-₱339,340.00 

 

5. The accountable officer (AO) failed to notify the Commission on Audit (COA) 
and file an application for relief from property accountability for the death of 5,771 

seedlings of various fruit trees worth ₱339,340.00 at the University Nursery, Pomology 

and Orchard (NPO), inconsistent with Section 73(1) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 

1445, thus, precluding the Audit Team from validating such evidences to warrant credit 

for the loss, and the timely recognition by the Accounting Office of the liability of the 

designated AO, in case negligence was proven on his part.   

 

5.1 It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be 
managed, expended or utilized in accordance with laws and regulations, and safeguarded 

against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, hence, every officer of any 

government agency whose duties permit or require the possession or custody of 

government funds or property shall be accountable therefor and for the safekeeping thereof 

in conformity with law.  

 

5.2 However, there are events of natural or human origin which cannot be reasonably 
foreseen or expected and are out of one’s control, so loss of property occurs despite the 

exercise of due diligence by the officers in charge thereof.  

 

5.3  Section 73(1) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 provides the rules and 
regulations, in case loss of government funds and property occurs; to wit:   

 

When a loss of government funds or property occurs while they are in transit or the 

loss is caused by fire, theft, or other casualty or force majeure, the officer 

accountable therefor or having custody thereof shall immediately notify the 

Commission or the auditor concerned and, within thirty days or such longer period 

as the Commission or auditor may in the particular case allow, shall present his 



65 

 

application for relief, with the available supporting evidence. Whenever warranted 

by the evidence credit for the loss shall be allowed. An officer who fails to comply 

with this requirement shall not be relieved of liability or allowed credit for any loss 

in the settlement of his accounts. 

 

5.4 We undertook a review of the quarterly report on the Biological Assets maintained 
under the different projects of the University Business Affairs Program (UBAP) submitted 

by management on October 21, 2020. The report revealed losses due to death of thousands 

of seedlings in the Nursery, Pomology, and Orchard (NPO) Project of the (UBAP) costing 

₱727,635.00 in the aggregate. Reportedly, the losses occurred during the 2nd and 3rd 

quarters of the year 2020, detailed as follows:

5.5 The Audit Team immediately visited the UBAP Office to confirm the quantity of 
seedlings which perished as reflected in the submitted report, but the officer in charge 

retracted their information on the matter. Accordingly, he inadvertently included all 

deductions in the inventory of seedlings under the column “death” unknowing of the effect 

on his accountability. He claimed that some were actually sold and some were planted 

around the campus. As such, the Audit Team allowed the revision of the report provided 

that copies of the official receipts (ORs) as proof of the sale of the seedlings and photos of 

the seedlings planted be attached to the revised report. 



66 

 

5.6 On December 4, 2020, the UBAP Office submitted a revised report together with 
the required attachments. Based on the validation made by the Audit Team, presented 

below is the list of young seedlings of various fruit trees which did not survive as of 

December 31, 2020; viz:

5.7 The NPO officers averred that they were not duly informed of the procedures to be 
done in case of loss thru death of the plantlets. However, we are of the view that 

Management is very much aware of the process since the Notices of Loss and Requests for 

Relief were constantly submitted to the Auditor’s Office every time deaths of goats, swine 

and cattle happened.   

 

5.8 We surmised that the NPO did not find any urgency in reporting the loss of the 
seedlings due to the minimal unit value involved. Be that as it may, all losses of government 

property, regardless of amount, shall be reported immediately and formally by the 

accountable officer once damaged or lost by virtue of Section 73 of P.D.No.1445 to free 

him from liability. The non-reporting of these losses is, therefore, contrary to the 

aforementioned regulation and unduly prevented the examining officer (Audit Team) from 

performing timely verification of the evidences that can warrant the grant of relief from 



67 

 

accountability to the officers in whose care the government property was entrusted. 

Furthermore, the non-reporting of said losses delayed the dropping from the books of 

accounts of the subject seedlings resulting in the overstatement of the Biological Assets 

account by ₱339,340.00.  

 

5.9 We recommended and the University President agreed to (a) require the 

concerned accountable officer to submit the required request for relief from property 

accountability with complete supporting documents; (b) ensure that immediate 

notification is served to the Audit Team in case of subsequent losses of property 

caused by fire, theft, or other casualty or force majeure; and (c) cause the submission 

of the required application for relief from accountability within the prescribed period 

of 30 days; otherwise, no credit for the loss shall be granted to the accountable officer 

concerned. 

 

5.10 During the exit conference, the Vice President for Business Affairs informed the

Inadequate documentation of Hazard Pay- ₱3,149,052.00 

 

6. Disbursements totaling to ₱3,149,052.00 for the payment of COVID-19 Hazard 
Pay during the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) were not adequately supported 

with the necessary/relevant documents as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2012-001 

dated June 14, 2012, DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020, and 

Section 4 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No.1445.  

  

6.1 On March 16, 2020, the President of the Republic of the Philippines placed the 
entirety of Luzon under Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) to prevent the rise of 

COVID-19 cases. Everyone was ordered to observe strict home quarantine and restrict 

movement to allow only essential personnel from transporting to their respective 

workplaces.   

  

6.2 The Central Luzon State University (CLSU) was of no exception from the 
guidelines to be observed while on ECQ.  Nonetheless, for the University to continue the 

provision of necessary services and programs, various employees and workers were 

required to physically report for work.  In order to compensate these employees and 

workers inevitably exposed to health risks and hazards during the period of ECQ, the 

payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay was authorized.  

 

6.3 Paragraph 4 of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Budget Circular 
No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2021 prescribes, among others, that a maximum of ₱500.00 

can be paid as COVID-19 Hazard Pay to all personnel who are authorized to physically 

report for work at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official 

working hours by the head of the agency/office during the period of implementation of 

ECQ measures. 



68 

 

6.4 From March 24, 2020 to May 31, 2020, the CLSU disbursed COVID-19 Hazard 
Pay totaling to ₱3,149,052.00 thru the following payrolls: 

 
Payroll No. Inclusive Dates Number of 

Employees 

Amount 

C-004 March 24 to May 6 30 ₱       551,500.00 
C-005 March 24 to May 6 2 22,250.00 

C-014 March 24 to May 6 4 27,794.50 

C-023 March 24 to May 6 51 529,437.50 

C-057 March 24 to May 6 23 223,500.00 

C-009 May 7 to May 3 41 273,000.00 

C-010 May 7 to May 3 3 16,000.00 

C-012 May 7 to May 3 126 575,692.50 

C-014 May 7 to May 3 100 759,062.50 

C-015 May 7 to May 3 4 19,125.00 

C-065 May 7 to May 3 25 151,690.00 

TOTAL   ₱ 3,149,052.00 

  

6.5 The audit of the aforementioned transactions showed that the required office order 
or authority from the Head of the Agency and the essential supporting documents such as 

Daily Time Records (DTRs) and Accomplishment Reports (ARs) were not attached to the 

payrolls. As evident in various certifications signed by the Chief Accountant, there were 

indeed lacking documents during the processing of the payrolls but, in spite of it, the 

Hazard Pay was approved for payment. Please refer to Appendix L for the schedule of 

documents not duly supported to the claims. 

 

6.6 Relatively, Paragraph 5.8 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 
requires the attachment of the following mandatory requirements in the payment of Hazard 

Pay: 

 

i. Certification by the Secretary of the Department of Science and Technology 
(DOST)/Department of Health (DOH)/ Department of National Defense 

(DND)/ Director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology 

(PHILVOCS) that the place of assignment/travel is a strife-

torn/embattled/disease-infested/distressed or isolated areas/stations, or areas 

declared under state of calamity or emergency, or with volcanic activity 

and/or eruption; 

ii. Duly accomplished time record of employees or travel report; 
iii. Copy of special order from the agency/department head covering the 

assignment to hazardous/difficult areas; and 

iv. Approved DTR/Service Report 
 

6.7 Likewise, Section 4(6) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 explicitly provides 
that Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation. 

 

6.8 The non-submission of these documents precluded the Audit Team from validating 
the propriety and accuracy of the amounts disbursed. The habitual practice of approving 



69 

 

disbursements without complete and appropriate documentation is a sign of a weak internal 

control which could mature into an irregularity. Likewise, any deviation from established 

rules may connote an occurrence of irregular transactions. In this light, transactions 

continually not conforming to the afore-cited law, rules and regulations are disallowable in 

audit. 

  

6.9 The Chief, Accounting Office requested the University President to issue another 
memorandum to reiterate the immediate submission of the required documents for those 

who have not yet submitted. She also informed the Audit Team that their target 

accomplishment for compliance would be until the end of July 2021. 

 

6.10 We recommended and the University President agreed to instruct all officials 

concerned to submit the required documents as specified in Appendix L and strictly 

ensure that all succeeding disbursements are duly supported with the necessary 

documents.  

 

 

Deficiencies in the grant and liquidation of cash advances  

 

7. Cash advances granted to an accountable officer (AO), reaching up to 
₱8,000,000.00 on several occasions, were in excess of the maximum amount of cash 

accountability of ₱1,000,000.00 covered by her fidelity bond, thereby placing the funds 

at the risks of loss due to theft, other casualty or embezzlement and non-indemnification 

by the government in case of such losses. Moreover, additional cash advances were 

granted to the AO despite non-liquidation of her previous cash advances and presence 

of cash balances in her custodianship, contrary to Items 4.1.2 and 7.5 of COA Circular 

No. 97-002, dated February 10, 1997. 

 

7.1 The regulation on the amount of bond for an accountable officer (AO) necessary 
for the amount of his/her cash accountability is prescribed under Item 7.5 of COA Circular 

No. 97-002, dated February 10, 1997 which states: 

 

The amount of bond necessary for the cash accountability of the AO shall 

be in accordance with the schedule of cash accountability and bond 

issued by the Bureau of the Treasury. 

  

7.2 If the Auditor finds that the cash advance of the AO is excessive of the cash 
accountability covered by his bond, the Auditor has the duty to recommend reduction of 

the cash advance, as provided in Item 9.1 of the same COA Circular, which states: 

 

The Auditor shall periodically evaluate the accountability of the AO and 

recommend reduction of the cash advance if found excessive. 

(Underscoring supplied) 

 

7.3 As stated above, the AO was bonded with the Fidelity Bond Division of the Bureau 
of the Treasury in the amount of ₱500,000.00, with corresponding maximum cash 



70 

 

accountability of ₱1,000,000.00.  In the evaluation of the cash advances granted to the AO 

for the period April 1 to September 23, 2020, we noted that there were instances where the 

amount of her cash advances exceeded the maximum cash accountability covered by her 

bond, which ranged from ₱1,040,000.00 to ₱8,000,000.00 in one day, as shown below:

7.4 Further evaluation of the cash management system and interview with the AO 
revealed that her cash advances were entrusted to another designated Special Disbursing 

Officer (SDO) at the Cashier’s Office who performed actual payments to the different 

claimants/payees. At the end of the day, the latter official gives to the AO all paid 

transactions (payrolls and disbursement vouchers), including the remaining cash 



71 

 

transferred to her (if any). The AO then records all paid transactions for the day, deducts 

all payments from her cash advance to arrive at the cash advance balance, and compares 

the same to the cash on hand returned by the SDO. We verified that she closes the 

cashbooks at the end of each working day, determines the balances in each cashbook and 

reconciles the same with the amount of cash on hand, plus the total amount of partly paid 

payrolls. 

 

7.5 Although the above procedure facilitated the payment process, since all cash 
advances for the eight funds of the University were made in the name of the AO subjected 

to audit, the system of transferring the cash advance from one Accountable Officer to 

another is prohibited under Item 4.1.6 of COA Circular No. 97-002, which provides that: 

 

Transfer of cash advance from one Accountable Officer (AO) to another 

shall not be allowed. 

 

7.6 Under the foregoing condition, the AO was assuming responsibility over and above 
the required amount of cash accountability covered by her bond. Moreover, the cash 

advances which were granted to her and entrusted to the other accountable officer placed 

another risk on her part in case of the loss of cash while in the custody of the other official. 

With insufficient bond, the amount of loss in excess of the fidelity bond coverage would 

not be indemnified by the Bureau of the Treasury. 

 

7.7 In view of the above observation, we recommended that the AO increase her bond, 
sufficient to cover the maximum amount of cash accountability in her name, in compliance 

with Item 7.5 of COA Circular No. 97-002.   

 

7.8 If the bond of the AO is not increased, her cash advance must be reduced up to 
₱1,000,000.00 only at any given time, while additional necessary cash advances may be 

granted to the other designated SDO (with lesser workload) who acted only as paymaster 

of the cash advances drawn by the Chief Cashier/AO. Said official was also duly bonded 

at ₱500,000.00 with maximum cash accountability of ₱1,000,000.00, which is equivalent 

to the bond of the AO. As such, she must be given the responsibility to handle separate 

cash advances under her name, thus, reducing the accountability of the AO while the two 

of them could pay claims separately, one for Personnel Services and the other for the 

Operating Expenses (all funds) of the University. 

 

7.9 In addition, in order to have stronger control in the granting of cash advances, Item 
4.1.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002, dated February 10, 1997 requires that: 

 

No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official or employee 

unless the previous cash advances given to him is first settled or a proper 

accounting thereof is made. 

 

7.10 Examination and review of the transactions recorded in the cashbooks and related 
Reports of Checks Issued/Reports of Cash Disbursements revealed that the AO always 

have remaining cash balances in her custody even at month-end, whereas it is mandatory 



72 

 

that cash advances should be closed to zero balance, except those intended for petty 

operating expenses.  Succeeding cash advances were granted to her on all funds handled, 

despite unused cash balances appearing in the cashbook. As a result, cash accumulated in 

the custody of the AO, which exposed the funds to various types of risk, including physical 

loss of cash and misappropriation. 

 

7.11 The above observation was discussed with the AO and she explained that due to 
the difficulty of processing the documents for immediate withdrawal of cash advances, she 

ensured that cash on hand is always available to immediately pay incoming claims upon 

demand. 

 

7.12 The Audit Team was not so convinced with the explanation rendered by the AO, 
since we found out that cash balances reflected in the cashbooks included even those 

intended for the payment of personnel services, where the ruling is that amount of cash 

advance shall be equal to the net amount of payrolls for each payment period as emphasized 

under Item 4.2.1 of the above COA Circular, viz:  

 

The cash advances shall be equal to the net amount of the payroll for a pay 

period. 

 

7.13 On the cash advances intended for the payment of petty operating expenses, Item 
4.3.1 of the same COA Circular provides that: 

 

The cash advance shall be sufficient for the recurring expenses of the agency 

for one month. 

 

7.14 Retaining big amounts of cash on hand at a given time is risky and detrimental to 
the government considering the volatility of cash and its susceptibility to misuse.     

 

7.15 The University Cashier informed the Audit Team that the amount of her bond was 
already increased to ₱1,500,000.00 with corresponding maximum cash accountability of 

₱5,000,000.00. 

 

7.16 We recommended and the Management agreed to (i) cease from granting 
additional cash advances to the accountable officer (AO), especially those intended 

for payment of personnel services, unless the previous cash advance is fully settled or 

properly accounted for; and (ii) limit amount of cash advances for petty operating 

expenses to the extent of the recurring expenses of the University for one-month 

period.  

 

 

Collections not covered by Accountable Form No. 51 (Official Receipt) 

 

8. Weaknesses in internal control were noted in existing practices such as (a) 
issuance of customized temporary receipts to paying customers totaling to 

₱13,697,826.72; (b) various deputized collectors were not properly bonded; and (c) 



73 

 

collections received at the project sites were not promptly remitted to the University 

Cashier contrary to the rules and regulations on the receipt and deposit/remittance of 

cash as prescribed under Section 68 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 and pertinent 

Sections of the Government Accounting Manual  (GAM) for National Government 

Agencies (NGAs), Volume I; thus, government funds were exposed to possible 

loss/misapplication. 

 

8.1 Cash is the most liquid among assets and is susceptible to loss if not properly 
controlled; hence, it is of utmost importance that all agencies adhere to strong internal 

controls particularly those provided for by laws, rules and regulations.  

 

8.2 For CY 2020, the University had cash collections under Fund 06207512 or Business 
Type Income amounting to ₱25,214,226.91 primarily derived from the sales of milled rice, 

eggs, broiler, purified water and others.  

 

8.3 During the cash count and examination of the official receipts (ORs) issued by the 
University Cashier, the Audit Team noted various collections from sales or service 

transactions undertaken by the University thru different business projects. A closer look of 

the details of the collections revealed 13,095 transactions covering remittances from said 

business projects but the individual ORs supporting the transactions were not the 

prescribed Accountable Form 51-C. In lieu of this, we gathered that it has been the practice 

among the business projects to initially issue temporary receipts to paying customers and, 

then, subsequently remit the total collections to the University Cashier who issues a single 

receipt to acknowledge the remittances. Collections of this type reached to ₱13,697,826.72, 

supported by 359 ORs issued by the Cashier’s Office, as follows:  

 

Project (Payee) Qty. Amount 

Broiler Project 9      ₱      1,715,891.82  

CAG-IGP Native Project 3              9,278.00

74 

 

8.4 Section 68(1) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, otherwise known as the State 
Auditing Code of the Philippines requires that no payment of any nature shall be received 

by a collecting officer without immediately issuing an official receipt in acknowledgement 

thereof. The receipt may be in the form of postage, internal revenue or documentary stamps 

and the like, officially numbered receipts, subject to proper custody, accountability, and 

audit. 

 

8.5 Likewise, Section 4(g), Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), 
Volume I, prescribes that At no instance shall temporary receipts be issued to acknowledge 

the receipt of public funds. 

 

8.6 Interview with the Vice President of the University Business Affairs Program 
(UBAP) and the University Cashier disclosed that the above practice proves to be the best 

solution to the lack of manpower to handle the collections at the project sites, aside from 

the fact that this procedure was prescribed under the Operations Manual of the UBAP duly 

approved by the Board of Regents. According to them, the temporary receipts were pre-

numbered, properly accounted for and previously being submitted to the Audit Team for 

inspection.  

 

8.7 Nevertheless, actual inventory of the used and unused temporary receipts by the 
Audit Team showed these were printed in ordinary paper at the University Printing 

Services. Indeed, the receipts were numbered but without the security features to avoid 

illegal replication. Contrary to their claim, the inventory of these temporary receipts was 

not submitted to the Audit Team for periodic inspection. Despite the Audit Inquiry dated 

January 6, 2021 sent to Management and ocular inspections conducted in the project sites 

by the Audit Team, a total of 6,495 copies of the temporary receipts were neither accounted 

nor presented for inspection. The details of which are presented below:

8.8 Inspection of the logbook used in the issuance of unused sales invoices at the UBAP 
office showed that sales invoices with serial numbers 7601 to 8850 or 1,250 copies were 

issued to the Research Seed Production. However, the clerk in charge claimed that those 

were not yet actually printed, thus, not part of the inventory. The schedules of used and 

unused sales invoices accounted by the Audit Team are shown in Appendices M and N, 

respectively.  

 

8.9 Printing of the ORs and other accountable forms is regulated under Section 22 of 
Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11465 or the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year 

2020 which states, among others, that All agencies of the government SHALL engage the 

services of the National Printing Office, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and APO Production 

Unit as Recognized Government Printers (RGPs) for the printing of accountable forms xxx 

(Emphasis ours).   

 

8.10 On the other hand, the Audit Team noted during the visit at the project sites that all 
deputized collecting agents were not properly bonded and majority were hired thru Job 

Order (J.O.) contracts. In addition, upon conduct of surprise cash counts in various projects 

on January 12, 2021, we discovered that the poultry project had unremitted collections 

aggregating to ₱254,786.05 for the period covered January 2 to 12, 2021, itemized as 

follows: 

 

Date Collected Inclusive Sales Invoice Total Amount 

January 2, 2021 76950-76956 ₱ 43,437.00 

January 4, 2021 76957-76974 49,587.80

January 8, 2021 78028-78045 36,495.70 

January 9, 2021 78046-78062 46,463.70 

January 11, 2021 78063-78082 22,881.30 

January 12, 2021 78083-78091 8,636.30 

TOTAL ₱ 254,786.05 

 

8.11 In the absence of an exact provision on the matter in the New Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAS, we believe Section 21 of the Manual on the New 

Government Accounting System (MNGAS) still applies. The practice of the Agency was 

not in conformity with the MNGAS which states that All Collecting Officers shall deposit 

intact all their collections, as well as collections turned over to them by sub-

collectors/tellers, with AGDB daily or not later than the next banking day.  They shall 

record all deposits made in the Cash Receipts Record. Further, Section 101 (2) of P.D. No. 

1445 requires that Every accountable officer shall be properly bonded in accordance with 

law. 

 

8.12 Although the afore-cited remittances were reportedly accounted for and duly 
recognized as Revenues in the University books, still the use of temporary receipts is 

unacceptable in the purview of the aforementioned regulations. Also, government 



76 

 

employees who are buying goods or paying for services thru the University for official 

purpose/s may not be entitled to reimbursement of their expenses if issued with such 

temporary receipt. 

 

8.13 Moreover, the continuous failure by the University to install internal control 
measures such as restriction on the printing of official receipts; bonding of accountable 

officers; and prompt deposit/remittance of collections exposed government funds to 

possible misuse and increased the risk of duplication or re-use of temporary receipts for 

unscrupulous activities.   

 

8.14 We recommended that the University President (a) issue a directive putting a 
stop to the issuance of temporary receipts and instruct the University Cashier to 

request the services of the National Printing Office (NPO) for the printing of 

Accountable Form 51-C which shall be used by the University to acknowledge all 

forms of collections; (b) assign a duly bonded collecting officer  for security reasons; 

and (c) instruct all collecting officers to promptly remit/deposit all collections to the 

Casher’s Office. 

 

8.15 During the exit conference, the University President informed the Audit Team that 
he already issued a Memorandum prohibiting the issuance of temporary receipts, but as of 

this writing, the Audit Team was not yet furnished with the copy thereof. The Vice 

President for Business Affairs added that they designated the Chief of the Credit and 

Collection Office as Special Collecting Officer. 

 

 

Laxity in cash management at the Agricultural Science and Technology School 

 

9.  Control measures to safeguard the receipt and custody of cash collections from 

sales of palay and mangoes by the Agricultural Science and Technology School 

(ASTS) were inadequate due to (a) non-issuance of official receipts (OR) upon sale; 

(b) absence of fidelity bond of the School Treasurer; (c) non-remittance of cash 

collections to the University Cashier; (d) failure to deposit collections in an 

Authorized Government Depository Bank (AGDB); and (e) absence of 

documentation for the harvest and palay grains sold during the dry season of calendar 

year 2019, thus, resulting in the non-recognition of reported revenues in the books of 

accounts totaling to ₱5,800,327.00, and possible under-reported sales estimated at 

₱5,549,665.07. 

 

9.1 The Agricultural Science and Technology School (ASTS) is one of the two existing 
laboratory high schools of the Central Luzon State University (CLSU). It was established 

by virtue of the Board of Regents (BOR) Resolution No. 57-95 dated April 14, 1995 

purposely to continue the secondary agriculture programs for which the University was 

known for since its inception as the Central Luzon Agricultural School (CLAS). Its 

objective is to offer agricultural curriculums that have science and technology orientation 

using the “earn-while-you-learn” approach and involve the parents in the educational 

process using the “Family Farm School” concept. In its inception, the CLSU provided 



77 

 

teaching staff from the College of Education, initial financing, and allowed the use of its 

arable land for its farm production. The farm operations serve as hands-on training program 

for the students as well as source of income for both the school and its students.  
 

9.2 Currently, the capacity to accept more students has increased and the curricula 
being offered evolved to adapt to current requirements. It is now recognized as a 

Laboratory High School and granted authority by the Department of Education (DepED) 

to offer the Technical-Vocational Livelihood Track for Senior High School. Similarly, its 

farm operations intensified into commercial production instead of the usual supervised 

farming for the student’s hands-on training as shown in the table below: 
 

Farm Classification Area Purpose 

Rice Farm 18.00 hectares Palay Production 

Rice Farm 3.70 hectares Student Training and Income 

Mango Farm 3.0 hectares For Commercial Production 

Animal Production Project 800 square meters Student Training and Income 

Vegetable Production 800 square meters Student Training and Income 

TOTAL 24.86 hectares  
 

9.3 During the examination on the cash collections and accountability of the University 
Cashier on December 1, 2020, the Audit Team learned that in spite of the growth in revenue 

and expenses resulting from its intensified production activities, the ASTS has no record 

of remittance of its cash collections to the University. This prompted the Audit Team to 

conduct further inquiry on the operations of the School. Subsequently, the Audit Team 

gathered during an interview with the Vice President of the University Business Affairs 

Program (UBAP) that the University President is also investigating the same operational 

deficiencies. As such, it was agreed upon by the Audit Team and the University President 

that we conduct a separate investigation, and the results of which are discussed in the 

succeeding paragraphs. 
 

9.4 Records showed that the ASTS had the following sales for the years 2017 to 2020:

9.5 Analysis of supporting documents such as harvest reports and truck scales of palay 
grains sold (Appendix O) as well as inquiry with the officials concerned showed the 

following observations: 

 

a. The ASTS directly sold all agricultural produce and collected the proceeds without 
issuing official receipts (ORs). 

 

b. Cash collections were neither remitted to the University Cashier nor deposited to 
an AGDB instead, the monies were kept in the drawer of the School Treasurer. 

   

c. The School Treasurer is not duly bonded with the Bureau of the Treasury.  
 

d. The reported harvest and amounts of sales reported from the four planting seasons 
for the period covered March 2017 to February 2019 materially differed from the 

normal volume of harvest per hectare when compared with the average harvest of 

the UBAP which was also farming adjacent to the area of ASTS. An analysis of the 

average harvest of both the ASTS and the UBAP involving an 18-hectare (ha) 

paddy field disclosed that the ASTS has an estimated deficit of 295,292.14 

kilograms (kg) valued at ₱5,549,665.07 from Wet Season 2017 to Wet Season 2020 

as shown in the following table:

TOTAL      ₱295,292.14  ₱5,549,665.07 

Note:  *The UBAP has no copy of the report of the actual harvest in Wet Season 2017 hence 

the average harvest between the Wet Season 2018 and Wet Season 2019 of the UBAP 

is used by the Audit Team as benchmark for the reported harvest and sales of the ASTS 

for the Wet Season 2017. 

**The ASTS reported gross sales of ₱453,600.00 in Dry Season 2019 but did not 

submit supporting documents to substantiate the weight of gross yield; hence, the 



79 

 

Audit Team applied ₱19.35 as price per kilo based on the average price of Dry Season 

2018 and Dry Season 2020 ((19.93 + 18.78) / 2)) to come up with an estimated gross 

yield of 23,873.68 kilograms (453,600 / 19.35). 

 

e. The harvest from the last three seasons from wet season 2019 to wet season 2020 
showed a huge increase even without an expansion in the land area of paddy fields. 

The result of harvest and amount of sale were closer to and even surpassed UBAP’s 

production in two cropping seasons which supported the possible under-reporting 

made by the ASTS in wet season 2017 to dry season 2019. The absence of 

documents to support the reported sales in dry season 2019 made it even more 

doubtful. 

 

f. The reported sales from the harvest of mango in CYs 2019 and 2020 were doubtful 
due to the absence of data and supporting documents from the ASTS to corroborate 

the report of sales. The drastic decrease of the amounts of sales in both CYs 2019 

and 2020 if compared with the harvest in CY 2018 added to the uncertainty of the 

reported sales as demonstrated in the table below:

Decrease in sales in CY 2020 compared 

with CY 2018 ₱ 101,398.00 60.84% 

 

9.6 Sections 2 and 101(1) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, otherwise known as 
the State Auditing Code of the Philippines require that: 

 

Section 2 – All resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized 

in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage 

through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, 

economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. 

 

Section 101(1) - Every officer of any government agency whose duties permit or 

require the possession or custody of government funds or property shall be 

accountable therefor and for the safekeeping thereof in conformity with law. 

 

9.7 Relatively, the aforementioned observations in the ASTS were inconsistent with 
the following relevant provisions embodied in the foregoing law; viz: 

 



80 

 

Section 63. Accounting for moneys and property received by public 

officials. Except as may otherwise be specifically provided by law or 

competent authority all moneys and property officially received by a public 

officer in any capacity or upon any occasion must be accounted for as 

government funds and government property. Government property shall be 

taken up in the books of the agency concerned at acquisition cost or an 

appraised value. 

 

Section 68. Issuance of official receipt. 

 

(1) No payment of any nature shall be received by a collecting officer without 

immediately issuing an official receipt in acknowledgement thereof. The 

receipt may be in the form of postage, internal revenue or documentary 

stamps and the like, officially numbered receipts, subject to proper custody, 

accountability, and audit.  xxx… 

 

Section 69. Deposit of moneys in the treasury. 

 

(1) Public officers authorized to receive and collect moneys arising from 

taxes, revenues, or receipts of any kind shall remit or deposit intact the full 

amounts so received and collected by them to the treasury of the agency 

concerned and credited to the particular accounts to which the said moneys 

belong. 

 

xxx… 

 

(4) The respective treasuries of these agencies shall in turn deposit with the 

proper government depository the full amount of the collections not later 

than the following banking day. 

Section 101. Accountable officers; bond requirements. 

 

xxx…  

 

2. Every accountable officer shall be properly bonded in accordance with 

law. (Underscoring supplied) 

 

Section 112. Recording of financial transactions. Each government 

agency shall record its financial transactions and operations 

conformably with generally accepted accounting principles and in 

accordance with pertinent laws and regulations. 

 

9.8 In line with the above provisions of law, the Government Accounting Manual 
(GAM) for the use of National Government Agencies (NGS) as prescribed under 

Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2015-007 dated October 22, 2015 prescribes, 

among others, the following forms and procedures for recording and reporting collections: 



81 

 

Appendix 29, GAM, Volume II – Cash Receipts Record (CRRec). Each 

Collecting Officer/Accountable Officer shall maintain this record to 

monitor his/her accountability. All transactions for the day shall be 

recorded immediately and a balance (Undeposited Collection) shall be 

extracted. The record shall be certified correct by the Collecting Officer 

at the end of each month or when required to do so by proper competent 

authority. 

 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I, Chapter 5, Section 40 - Detailed Procedures 

for Collections and Deposits through the Collecting Officer.  

 

Daily 

 

1. Receives cash/check from payor representing collection based on the 
Order of Payment (OP) (Appendix 28) prepared by the Accounting 

Division/Unit. 

 

2. Issues OR to acknowledge receipt of cash/check. 
 

Note 1 – The OR shall be prepared in three copies and distributed as 

follows: 

 

Original – Payor 

Copy 2 – To be attached to the RCD/CRReg 

Copy 3 – Cash/Treasury Unit file 

 

3. Records collections in the Cash Receipts Record (CRRec) (Appendix 
29). 

 

4. Prepares DSs in three copies. 
 

Note 2 – The DSs shall be distributed as follows: 

Original – AGDB 

Copy 2 – To be attached to RCD/CRRec 

Copy 3 – Cash/Treasury Unit file  

 

9.9 Interview with the School Principal, Farm Manager, and the School Treasurer 
disclosed that the operating procedures and practices that they are implementing were just 

handed out to them from the previous Management. Accordingly, they presumed that these 

practices are proper and/or normal since these procedures are in place when they assumed 

their designations in the School. 

 

9.10 The practice of the ASTS Management of not issuing an official receipt 
immediately upon collection of sale was not only in contravention of the provisions of the 

aforementioned law but rendered difficulty in ascertaining the actual proceeds from sales 

resulting in possible under declaration of actual collections. 



82 

 

9.11 Further, the non-remittance of cash collections to the University Cashier or to an 
AGDB weakened the control measure on the safeguard of cash from loss thru theft of 

robbery especially during the night or weekends. Furthermore, the absence of bond is 

prejudicial to the University because the ASTS Management will not be able to recover 

any sum of money in case of defalcation or shortages in the custody of erring personnel.  
 

9.12 In sum, owing to the foregoing weaknesses in the internal control structure of the 
ASTS and non-compliance by the officials concerned with pertinent laws, rules and 

regulations, the revenues derived from the aforementioned activities totaling to 

₱5,800,327.00 were not recognized in the Accounting books which in turn had understated 

the reported income of the University. Likewise, the absence of precise data on harvests 

and properly substantiated sales reports and the non-submission of the same to the 

University subject for validation and recording created doubt on the integrity of existing 

records, disclosing possible under reporting of the quantity of palay grains harvested 

totaling to 295,292.14 kilograms valued at approximately ₱5,549,665.07.  Consequently, 

the practice, if left uncorrected, would eventually result to enormous losses of government 

funds and property.    

 

9.13 In view of the foregoing observations, we recommended and the Management 
agreed to undertake the following immediate corrective measures: 

 

(a) Consider the designation of an authorized Collecting Officer (CO) at the ASTS 
who will be subsequently bonded in accordance with law, and properly trained 

in the handling of government funds;  

 

(b) Instruct the designated CO on the proper use of authorized and pre-numbered 
official receipts in the collection of sales of agricultural produce;  

 

(c) Direct the School Principal to immediately cause the remittance of the School 
collections to the University Cashier, including whatever balance was left as of 

examination date;   

 

(d) Create a Task Force to conduct thorough investigation of the deficiencies 
initially noted by the Audit Team in the audit of the harvest and sales of palay 

from wet season 2017 to dry season 2019 where an estimated understatement 

in sales of ₱5,549,665.07 was discovered, as well as the reported sales of mango 

of undetermined amount; and 

 

(e) Cause the early submission of the results of such investigation to the Audit 
Team, together with an explanation why such discrepancies occurred.  

Collections used outright to defray cash purchases 

 

10.  The ASTS Management continued the old practice of using its revenue as 

revolving funds in which collections were used outright to defray cash purchases of 

supplies and equipment contrary to the fundamental principles governing financial 

transactions as provided in Section 4 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 resulting 



83 

 

in the (a) complete disregard of the existing Procurement Law; (b) unrecorded 

expenses for the period covered March 2017 to January 29, 2021 totalling to 

₱5,846,885.59; (c) unrecorded equipment purchased at ₱100,800.00; (d) 

disbursements without any supporting documents or valid proofs of payment 

aggregating to ₱1,630,901.00; and (e) cash deficit of ₱130,675.78 as of examination 

date- January 29, 2021. 

 

10.1 Section 4 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 requires, among others, that: 

 

(1) No money shall be paid out of any public treasury or depository except 

in pursuance of an appropriation law or other specific statutory authority. 

xxx...  

(5) Disbursements or disposition of government funds or property shall 

invariably bear the approval of the proper officials. 

 

(6) Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete 

documentation. xxx… 

 

(8) Generally accepted principles and practices of accounting as well as 

of sound management and fiscal administration shall be observed, 

provided that they do not contravene existing laws and regulations. 

 

10.2 From the submitted reports of disbursements by the ASTS (Appendix P) covering 

the period March 27, 2017 to January 18, 2021, the Audit Team validated total 

disbursements of ₱5,846,885.59. Out of this amount, a sum of ₱1,630,901.00 had no 

documents or valid proofs of payment to support the propriety and validity of the reported 

disbursements, as detailed in the said Appendix, and summarized below: 

 
Deficiencies Noted Qty. of Transactions Total Amount 

No documents attached 133 ₱1,318,092.00 

Invalid proof of payment 85 203,687.00 

Expired OR attached 14 14,036.00 

Cash Voucher Only 36 95,086.00 

TOTAL 268 ₱1,630,901.00 

 

10.3 In addition, review of payments, with attached documents, disclosed that purchases 

were authorized thru a cash voucher approved by the School Principal and supported by 

receipts, invoices and/or mere sheets of papers with listed expenses. In certain instances, 

payments were undertaken thru Cash Advances which also lacked the required supporting 

documents. 

 

10.4 Accordingly, the current Management of the School also claimed that the 

disbursement procedures being implemented were just handed down to them by the 

previous Management; thus, they presumed it was proper. 

 

10.5 Such practices by the ASTS Management are not in accordance with Section 36, 

Chapter 1 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government 



84 

 

Agencies (NGAs) which states, among others, that (f.) Submission of proper evidence to 

establish validity of the claim. xxx… All payments of government obligations and payables 

shall be covered by Disbursement Vouchers (DVs)/Payrolls together with the original copy 

of the supporting documents which will serve as basis in the evaluation of authenticity and 

authority of the claim. xxx…  

 

10.6 Relatively, COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribes the Revised 

Guidelines and Documentary Requirements for Common Government Transactions. Item 

1.2.2 thereof enumerates the specific documentary requirements for the liquidation of Petty 

Cash Fund (PCF) in case the School utilized Cash Advances as the mode of payment of 

field/operating expenses; to wit: 

 

□ Summary of Petty Cash Vouchers; 
□ Report of Disbursement; 
□ Petty Cash Replenishment Report; 
□ Approved purchase request with certificate of Emergency Purchase, if 

necessary; 

□ Bills, receipts, sales invoices; 
□ Certificate of inspection and acceptance; 
□ Report of Waste Materials in case of replacement/repair; 
□ Approved trip ticket, for gasoline expenses; 
□ Canvass from at least three suppliers for purchases involving ₱1,000.00 and 

above, except for purchases made while on official travel; 

□ Summary/Abstract of Canvass; 
□ Petty Cash Vouchers duly accomplished and signed; 
□ OR in case of refund; 
□ For reimbursement of toll receipts 

o Toll Receipts 
o Trip Tickets 

□ Such other supporting documents that may be required and/or required under 
the company policy depending on the nature or expense 

 

10.7 As of January 29, 2021, the Audit Team was informed that the Management of 

ASTS already remitted a total amount of ₱766,561.63 to the University Cashier. However, 

the reconciliation prepared by the Audit Team thru validation of the original copies of 

supporting documents submitted revealed various discrepancies in the reported 

expenditures. The remaining accountability of the Treasurer of the ASTS as shown in the 

reconciliation statement should have been ₱897,237.41, thus, showing a net difference of 

₱130,675.78. The reconciliation statement is attached hereto, marked as Appendix Q. 

 

10.8 Supporting documents are essential audit references used to ascertain the propriety 

of the disbursements; determine the degree of compliance or adherence of the procuring 

entity to the Government Procurement Reform Act (R.A. No. 9184); and test the validity 

of the expenses paid. The insufficiency of the required documents precluded the Audit 

Team from validating the propriety and accuracy of the amounts disbursed. Further, the 



85 

 

lack of documents supporting the disbursements proved to be the main cause of the 

inaccuracies in the reported statement of sales and disbursements of the ASTS. 

 

10.9 As discussed earlier, the non-remittance of sales proceeds to the University Cashier 

and the outright disbursement of collections for cash purchases resulted in the non-

recognition of expenses in the sum of ₱5,846,885.59 and non-recording of purchased 

equipment in the appropriate Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) accounts for 

₱100,800.00 as shown in the table below: 

 
Date Particulars Amount 

September 21, 2018 Daikin cooling system for male faculty ₱41,300.00 

November 26, 2018 Electric Motor 7.5 hp. 18,000.00 

October 18, 2019 Air conditioning unit for extension office 41,500.00 

TOTAL ₱100,800.00 

 

10.10 Further, expenses paid without duly approved DVs, supporting documents and 

proofs of payments are indication of serious weaknesses in internal control that exposed 

government funds and properties to possible loss and/or risk of possible irregularities or 

misappropriations. Similarly, the non-compliance with established rules may connote an 

occurrence of illegal and/or irregular transactions.  In this regard, the aforementioned 

unsound practices in the system of collection and disbursement at the ASTS, if not rectified 

and eradicated, are deemed transgression of the afore-cited laws, rules and regulations, 

thus, disallowable in audit. 

 

10.11 During the exit conference, we commended the ASTS School Principal for the 

settlement of the remaining accountability amounting to ₱130,675.78. The amount was 

already remitted to the University Cashier on February 22, 2021 and a copy of the 

corresponding official receipt numbered 1140945 was furnished to the Auditor’s Office. 

 

10.11 We recommended and the Management agreed to instruct the ASTS School 

Principal to (a) undertake the appropriate mode of procurement of supplies and 

materials in keeping with R.A. No. 9184 or establish a reasonable amount of Petty 

Cash Fund  (PCF) to facilitate the defrayment of petty operating expenses; (b) 

recognize the equipment purchased in the amount of ₱100,800.00; and (c) ensure that 

all subsequent payments are properly covered by duly approved/signed 

Disbursement Vouchers (DVs)/Payrolls with original copies of valid supporting 

documents attached to serve as basis in the evaluation of authenticity and authority 

of the disbursements. 

 

 

Compliance with accreditation requirements 

 

11.  The workloads given to majority of faculty members were limited to instruction 

and administrative functions; thus, other mandates of the University in relation to 

Research, Extension, and Production were not equally given importance and priority. 

Consequently, the performance of the University in these aspects did not earn high 

accreditation status from internationally recognized accrediting bodies.    



86 

 

 

11.1 The Central Luzon State University (CLSU) is one of the renowned institutions of 

agriculture in the country. It was designated by the Commission on Higher Education 

(CHED) – National Agriculture and Fisheries Education System (NAFES) as National 

University College of Agriculture (NUCA) and National University College of Fisheries 

(NUCF). Similarly, CLSU was designated as CHED’s Center of Excellence (COE) in 

Agriculture, Agricultural Engineering, Biology, Fisheries, Teacher Education, and 

Veterinary Medicine, thus, having the greatest number of COEs in Central and Northern 

Luzon. Likewise, it was designated as the Center of Research Excellence in Small 

Ruminants by the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquaculture, Forestry and Natural 

Resources Research and Development by the Department of Science and Technology 

(PCAARRD-DOST). 

 

11.2 The University was also a recipient of Level II institutional accreditation from the 

Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities in the Philippines (AACCUP) 

and a three-star rating from the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), the worldwide provider of 

services, analytics, and insight to the global higher education sector, using the QS rating 

system that provides a detailed look at an institution to identify which universities are the 

best in program strength, facilities, graduate employability, social responsibility, 

inclusiveness, and more. 

 

11.3 As a higher education institution (HEI), CLSU is in the pursuit of a vision to 

become A world-class National Research University for science and technology in 

agriculture and allied fields, with a mission to Develop globally competitive, work ready, 

socially-responsible and empowered human resources who value life-long learning; and 

to generate, disseminate, and apply knowledge and technologies for poverty alleviation, 

environmental protection, and sustainable development. The accomplishment of this 

vision and mission rests on the pursuit of the University’s four-fold functions as mandated 

under Section 5, Article 2, Chapter 1 of the Central Luzon State University (CLSU) Code 

which states that the University shall continuously enhance its capability and potential to 

pursue excellence and leadership in its mandated four-fold functions of instruction, 

research, extension and training, and production. These functions are best portrayed in the 

following framework. 

 



87 

 

11.4 The framework emphasizes the research function not just because the CLSU 

envisioned to be recognized as a “National Research University”, but because research 

productivity is very important in all HEIs. HEIs put high regard to research productivity 

because it can enrich its curricular programs, allow its faculty to grow and develop new 

knowledge, open linkages with international institutions, and generate new technologies, 

solutions, and policies that can be transferred to its students thru the University’s 

instruction function. It can also be extended to target clienteles such as industries, 

community, individual farmers and fisher folks. On the other hand, production is positioned 

in the middle because the results of each of the three functions can be converted into 

products such as competitive graduates, books, patents, utility models, trademarks, 

innovations, technologies, and policies. Production does not necessarily mean producing 

goods that can compete existing industries, but rather support and demonstrate new or 

sustainable technologies or products. The successful discharge of these functions can create 

an impact on the recognition of CLSU as a reputable institution of higher education, a 

matured research University and an institution that can extend solution to the challenges of 

poverty, environmental protection, and sustainable development. 

 

11.5 Interview with the Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA) and review of 

various issuances from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) clarified the 

following reasons why research is an integral part of the framework and how each 

mandated function is anchored on it: 

 

a. Global or International Reputation 
 

Research works of faculty in HEIs is a common metrics by third party accrediting 

bodies in gauging the educational quality of a University and awarding 

certifications. Even “Google” created a dedicated website called Google Scholar, 

to serve as database for scholarly research and an index of faculties all over the 

world who are actively doing functional research. These serves as a system of 

measurement for other institutions, other faculty, and students all over the world to 

assess the reputation of a certain University.  
 

If the CLSU has high research productivity, its reputation will be known worldwide 

resulting in more international partnerships with other Universities which can open 

up opportunities for knowledge acquisition that will ultimately flow to the students 

thru instruction. Further, it will boost the morale or sense of pride among faculty 

and students, and can increase the trust and confidence of various industries to the 

graduates of CLSU. 

 

b. Strengthen Curricular Programs  
 

Paragraph (e), Article IV of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) 

Memorandum Circular No. 01 series of 2005 provides the following requirements 

for a program to be accredited as level IV, meaning, the accredited programs are 

highly respected as very high-quality academic programs in the Philippines and 



88 

 

with prestige and authority comparable to similar programs in excellent foreign 

universities: 

 

a. Excellent outcomes in research as seen in number, scope and impact of 
scholarly publications in referred national and international publications; 

b. Excellent outcomes in teaching as proven in excellent performance of 
graduates and continuing assessment of student achievement; 

c. Excellent in community service and the impact of contributions to the 
economic and social upliftment, on both regional and national levels; 

d. Evidence of international linkages and consortia; and 
e. Well-developed planning processes which support quality assurance 

mechanisms. 

 

Moreover, Section 14, Article VI of the CHED Memorandum Circular No. 15, 

series of 2019 specifically states that all private and public HEIs offering or 

planning to offer graduate programs are required to maintain a solid research 

and/or creative work program in the chosen specific area or field of study. 

 

c. Personal growth of faculty 
 

The implementation guidelines of National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 461 dated 

June 1, 1998 show that one common requirement in the appointment as Instructor 

up to Professor level is qualitative contributions in instruction, research, extension 

and production. This shows that the growth of a faculty lies on the pursuit of the 

mandated four-fold functions.  

 

Research productivity in the form of publications is a first-hand knowledge gained 

by the faculty which can be transferred to students. These publications or research 

experiences give the faculty the confidence to claim that they can rightfully mentor 

their students in their field of study. 

 

Moreover, faculty members who continue their research works even after attaining 

their Master’s or Doctorate Degrees made them experts or specialists in their own 

discipline turning them into a “functional PhD”. Thus, the more experts or 

specialists in the CLSU faculty, the more the institution becomes matured or 

established HEI. 

 

11.6 These four-fold functions are exemplified in the organizational structure of the 

University by assigning a Vice President (VP) for each of the major programs; namely: the 

VP for Academic Affairs Program to head the instruction function, VP for Research, 

Training and Extension Program for research and extension functions, and VP for 

University Business Affairs program for production function. This robust organizational 

structure coupled with the recognitions and accreditations granted by various 

federation/network of accrediting agencies such as the AACCUP and QS World Rank 

could be an indication of a perfect system in place to pursue its mandates. However, a 



89 

 

closer look shows an area in the system that needs improvement in order for the University 

to actually pursue all its mandated functions and eventually achieve its goals and 

effectively discharge its mission statement. Analysis by the Audit Team of the workloads 

assigned to the academic workforce or the faculty from the last four semesters covering the 

periods Second Semester of School Year (SY) 2018-2019 to First Semester SY 2020-2021 

revealed the lack of attention to the research, extension, and production functions in the 

distribution and approval of workloads. This was the same reason why the assessment of 

the QS World Rank resulted in the awarding of only three stars for both research and 

extension. This deficiency in the distribution of workloads to the faculty is best pictured in 

the following graphs.

11.7 As can be seen in the charts above, the University allocated much of the workloads 

to actual teaching which is expected for an institution of learning. Nonetheless, the rest of 

the mandated functions were assigned only 3% to 6% of the total workload which is 

insignificant if compared with the allocation for Administrative and Instruction.

11.9 As confirmed thru interview with concerned University Officials, only a few were 

repeatedly designated to engage in research, extension and production functions.  

 

11.10 A particular example in the production function is the designation of a single faculty 

as director of two divisions under the UBAP Office. Accordingly, the reason for such was 

the lack of faculty personnel actually committed to accept the task. Management only 

assigned committed and trustworthy officers to delicate functions to avoid mishandling 

that may result in financial losses. However, the University officials also recognized the 

burden of work assigned to that single individual and the consequences if the official 

subsequently applies for study leave or resigns from the University. 

 

11.11 Moreover, the CHED has published an article in its website on November 25, 2020 

claiming that the Commission has been assisting Philippine HEIs to internationalize by 

helping them understand the international ranking system and by promoting their 

internationalization initiatives through university-to-university linkage programs and 

research. Moreover, in the same article, the CHED commended the following Philippine 

universities for making it up to this year’s edition of the QS World University Rankings 

for Asia; to wit: 

 
QS World University Rankings: Asia 2021 – Philippine Institutions 

 

 

11.12 Being part of that ranking is a great achievement for the CLSU.  Notwithstanding, 

a closer look of the categories evaluated by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) revealed matters 

that require serious attention and improvement in order for the University to climb up the 

ranks:

11.13 It could be noted that the University had been rated with the highest 5 stars in the 

categories that are closely related to Instruction but was rated with only 3 stars as regards 

other areas such as Research, Social Responsibility or Extension, Program Strength or 

Curricular Program Strength, and Internalization. This is a very clear manifestation of the 

need to improve the workloads on the areas of research and extension in order for the 

University to level up or at least effectively discharge all its mandated four-fold functions. 

 

11.14 In addition, the CLSU was given a Level II institutional accreditation status by the 

AACCUP using the same criterion provided for in the aforementioned CHED 

Memorandum Circular No. 01 series of 2005. Out of the 32 programs, 12 were accredited 

as level IV, eight were level III, another eight under level II, and four under level 1. 

 

11.15 The Audit Team recognized the need to designate faculty members in various 

administrative, extra-curricular, and other functions. Nevertheless, it is incumbent upon the 

CLSU Management to give equal priority to research, extension and production functions 

to fulfill its mandate and vision on a holistic approach. As such, the present faculty 

workload calls for a reassessment to include all mandated functions for purposes of 

satisfying current accreditation and ranking requirements of recognized accrediting bodies. 

 

11.16 In view of the foregoing observations, we recommended and Management 

agreed to (a) consider revising the Faculty Workload Manual to institutionalize the 

inclusion of research, extension and production functions among the workloads of 

faculty members; and (b) instruct the Committee concerned to review the structure 

of the existing Academic Workforce and ensure that each faculty member effectively 

contribute to the achievement of the mandated four-fold functions of the University, 

thereby sustaining a  remarkable status as a Higher Educational Institution (HEI).  

 

 

Compliance with GAD 

 

12.  Due to deficient planning, the budget allocated for Gender and Development 

(GAD) for the year 2020 amounted to ₱27,876,000.00 which was below the required 

amount of ₱38,457,700.00 or 5% of the University’s Annual Appropriation of 

₱769,154,000.00 pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Philippine Commission on Women-

National Economic Development Authority-Department of Budget and Management 



93 

 

(PCW-NEDA-DBM) Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01, thus, registering a deficit of 

₱10,617,800.00 or 27.52%.  Moreover, various GAD programs, activities and projects 

(PAPs) embodied in the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) were not fully implemented as at 

year-end, leaving an unutilized balance of ₱6,159,958.68 or 22.10%, which 

compromised the GAD mandate and objective of addressing identified gender issues.   

 

12.1 This is a reiteration of prior year’s audit observation. 

 

12.2 The Philippine Commission on Women-National Economic Development 

Authority-Department of Budget and Management (PCW-NEDA-DBM) Joint Circular 

(JC) No. 2012-01 provides guidelines for the preparation of the Annual Gender and 

Development (GAD) Plans and Budgets and Accomplishment Reports to implement the 

Magna Carta for Women. As clearly provided under Paragraph 6.1, it is required that at 

least five percent (5%) of the total agency budget appropriations authorized under the 

annual GAA shall correspond to activities supporting GAD plans and programs. The GAD 

budget shall be drawn from the agency’s maintenance and other operating expenses 

(MOOE), capital outlay, (CO), and personal services (PS).  It is understood that the GAD 

budget does not constitute an additional budget over an agency’s total budget 

appropriations. 

 

12.3 Examination of the GAD reports submitted to the Audit Team disclosed that the 

University GAD Office (UGADO) was able to submit a GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for 

calendar year 2020 duly reviewed and endorsed by the PCW. However, for the past five 

years (2016-2020), the University failed to satisfy the 5% minimum funding requirement 

for GAD as mentioned in the foregoing regulation. Consider the following data:

12.4 Further analysis showed that the approved GAD budget for CY 2020 of 

₱27,876,000.00 was relatively lower than the required amount of ₱38,457,700.00 or a 

discrepancy of ₱10,581,700.00 equivalent to 27.52%.  

 

12.5 Evaluation of the endorsed CY 2020 GPB and the draft accomplishment report

12.6 As noted by the Audit Team, the activities included in the GPB are mostly 
organization-focused such as trainings, orientations or information dissemination and 

workshops strengthening the institutional capacity of the University on GAD and the 

UGAD Office itself. While these activities are part of the regular functions of the Office, 

the UGAD should have optimized the use of GAD funds for the implementation of existing 

mandated programs of the University as a whole which shall likewise be subjected to 

gender analysis. All Major Final Outputs (MFOs) of the four main programs of the 

University, such as Instruction, Research, Extension, and Production should have been 

subjected to attribution process using the Harmonized Gender and Development 

Guidelines (HGDG) in order to meet the minimum required amount of GAD budget. 



99 

 

12.7 During the interview, the UGAD staff concerned admitted that one of the main 

reasons for not meeting the minimum required GAD plan is the failure to attribute GAD-

related activities in the regular programs of the University.  In addition, the UGAD Office 

had restricted access to the draft GPB submitted for review until the PCW returned the 

same which usually took at least one to two months’ time. As such, they were left with 

very limited period to revise or add more activities to replace the ones removed by the 

PCW. 

 

12.8 Moreover, the Audit Team noted that some of the planned activities in the table 
above were not conducted and/or partially implemented, leaving unutilized funds of 

₱6,159,958.68 or 22.09% of the original GPB. This was mainly due to the restrictions 

brought by the quarantine protocols in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The UGAD 

Office, however, included or attributed various COVID-19 response activities which were 

not originally included in the endorsed GPB; thus, the planned budget was almost doubled. 

Although the added activities were supported by GAD checklist, these were not evaluated 

by the PCW as to whether the attributions are proper and can qualify as GAD activities. 

 

12.9 Considering the above circumstances, the limited activities included in the GPB 
and the non-attribution of GAD-related activities at the onset of the planning stage resulted 

in inadequacy of budget. On the other hand, the non-adoption of required GAD 

mechanisms, such as attribution and HGDG tool constrained the UGAD from identifying 

the appropriate strategies or interventions to address underlying gender issues, thus, the 

difficulty to attain 100% program implementation.   

 

12.10 Overall, the deficient planning misdirected the University from attaining its GAD 
mandate and objectives.  

 

12.11  We reiterated our audit recommendation and the University President agreed 

to instruct the (a) University Budget Officer together with the Director of the 

University GAD Office to improve GAD planning and budgeting by identifying at 

least 5% of the total agency appropriations authorized under the annual GAA thru 

gender analysis and attribution of the University’s Major Final Outputs (MFOs) to 

the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to be submitted for evaluation/review by the PCW; 

and (b) Director of UGAD Office to strictly monitor the full implementation of each 

program, project and activity against targeted performance indicators to ascertain 

the necessity to alter strategies while ensuring that the  identified gender issues are 

properly managed.
