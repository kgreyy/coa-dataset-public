EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)	Introduction



	The Central Luzon State University (CLSU) was established in 1907, which for over the long years has been known as an agriculture-oriented educational institution; and became a comprehensive University, offering a number of science curricula in addition to its undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate courses. It has also two Laboratory High Schools in the campus, namely: University Science High School and the Agricultural Science and Technology School (ASTS).



	The CLSU’s mandate is to primarily give professional and technical training in agriculture and mechanic arts besides providing advanced instruction and promoting research in literature, philosophy, the sciences, technology and arts.

	The University has four main programs, namely: Instruction; General Administration and Support Services (GASS); Research, Extension and Training (RET); and Production.	



	In Calendar Year (CY) 2020, Research and Development (R&D) Grants totaling to ₱424,947,086.94 were generated by the University from various granting agencies and institutions such as the DA, DA-BAR, DA-RFO3, DA-BAI, DOST-PCAARRD, DOST-PCHRD, CHED, ATI, DENR, DILG, and IRRI among others. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, a total of 72 research programs, projects and studies were completed. While 116 are still ongoing with 79 GIA-funded, 34 externally-funded, and three other involvements.



	A total of 79 R&D papers/posters were presented in CY 2020, five of which were presented in international conferences, 15 in national, and 59 in local/institutional. CLSU faculty and staff researchers from the Academic and Research and Extension Programs have published 62 research papers in renowned scientific journals. A total of 64 faculty members from the different colleges achieved this milestone in scientific productivity.

C)	Scope of Audit



	The audit covered the review of accounts and financial operations of the CLSU    for the year ended December 31, 2020. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs) and we believe that it provided a reasonable basis for the audit results.

D)	Independent Auditor’s Report 



	The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the CLSU as of December 31, 2020 owing to the following exceptions: 



(1) 	The Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts with carrying value of ₱1,574,018,596.26 as of December 31, 2020 were unreliable due to (a) incomplete conduct of inventory-taking of PPE with only 16.25% actually counted; (b) unreconciled balances between the books and inventory report amounting to ₱87,563,734.12; and (c) inclusion of unserviceable items under the PPE totaling to ₱5,829,240.50 which were not reported to the Accounting Office thru the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) as basis for dropping from the books of the University;



(2) 	The reported balance of Biological Assets of ₱11,175,650.89 as at year-end was misstated due to (a) non-recognition of 2,890 units of matured fruit-bearing mango trees estimated at ₱15,650,000.00; (b) non-dropping from the books of accounts of the costs of dead and sold goats, sheep and swine totaling to ₱1,973,322.00; (c) misclassification of the laying hens under the Poultry Module Program costing ₱720,408.30 to the Inventories account instead of Biological Assets; (d) non-recognition of purchases of additional hens as well as sales and deaths resulting in the net overstatement of assets by ₱250,855.70; and (e) non-adjustment of the account for the reduced fair values of the remaining 37 heads of imported sheep totaling to ₱1,475,856.00; and 



(3) 	Accounting errors and lapses were committed in the recording of fund transfers to the Due to NGAs account such as (a) non-recognition of the return of funds to source agencies and non-adjustment of erroneous ledger balances of completed and ongoing research projects resulting to an overstatement of ₱3,812,633.91 ; (b) doubtful balances of 168 projects with an aggregate amount of ₱352,807,957.36 due to discrepancies between the accounting records and the summary of expenditures for each project and lack of supporting documents; and (c) unutilized balances of 98 completed projects totaling to ₱10,849,968.47 remained dormant in the custody of the University.



		For the above exceptions, we recommended and the University President agreed to undertake the following courses of action:



--	On Property, Plant and Equipment Accounts



a)	Require the (i) Chief, Property and Supply Office (PSO) to (i.a) prioritize the conduct of annual physical inventory of the University’s PPE to render an accurate report as basis of the Accounting Unit to correct the reported balance in the Financial Statements; and (1.b) prepare an IIRUP for the items of PPE with carrying value of ₱5,829,240.50 which were identified as unserviceable/beyond economic repair and due for disposal as of December 31, 2020; and (ii) the Chief, Accounting Office to (ii.a) secure from the Property and Supply Office, copy of the IIRUP for the newly identified items of unserviceable PPEs as of December 31, 2020 as basis for dropping them from the books of accounts; and (ii.b) undertake monthly reconciliation of each recorded PPE with the property records of the PSO as basis for the adjustment in the books, as warranted, and to bring the PPE account in updated status every reporting period.



--	On Biological Assets Accounts



b)	Instruct the (1) Manager of the Nursery, Pomology, and Orchard project to continue the actual counting and tagging of all mango trees inside the campus and submit to the Accounting Office a complete report thereto, including valuation, for recording in the books of accounts; and (2) the Accounting Office to (i) drop the recorded values of sold and dead goat, sheep and swine from the books of accounts totaling to ₱1,973,322.00 and record the corresponding receivables from the person accountable thereto; (ii) reclassify the laying hens recorded as inventories into the proper Biological Assets account; (iii) recognize the value of sold laying hens and those that died, as well as the changes in the fair value of the biological assets to correct the overstatement of ₱250,855.70 in the reported Biological Assets account; (iv) update the reported values of the laying hens to its current fair value; (v) adjust the Biological Assets account for the reduction in value of the remaining 37 heads of imported sheep calculated at ₱1,475,856.00; and (vi) ensure that all transactions related to the Biological Assets account for the current year and the ensuing years are properly accounted for.



--	On Due to NGAs

 

(c)  Instruct the University Accountant to (i) adjust the subsidiary ledger balances of projects for fully liquidated funds and refunds already made to source agencies in order to correct the overstatement of the Liabilities account in the Financial Statements; (ii) coordinate with project managers of completed and ongoing projects to reconcile the inconsistencies noted in the reported ending balances; (iii) furnish the Audit Team with copies of the MOA, LIB, NTP, and other supporting documents of the projects identified in clusters 7 and 8 as presented in the table above; (iv) prepare the necessary documents for the return of all unutilized/dormant fund balances of completed projects to the source agencies or to the National Treasury, where appropriate; and (v) require the project managers to strictly comply with the timely preparation and submission of the annual or semi-annual financial reports as required in the MOA.









E)		Summary of Other Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations

	

	The following are the other significant audit observations and recommendations which are discussed in detail in Part II of the Report:



1)	Weaknesses in internal control were noted in existing practices such as (a) issuance of customized temporary receipts to paying customers totaling to ₱13,697,826.72; (b) various deputized collectors were not properly bonded; and (c) collections received at the project sites were not promptly remitted to the University Cashier contrary to the rules and regulations on the receipt and deposit/remittance of cash as prescribed under Section 68 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 and pertinent Sections of the Government Accounting Manual  (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I; thus, government funds were exposed to possible loss/misapplication.  (Audit Observation No. 8)



We recommended that the University President (a) issue a directive putting a stop to the issuance of temporary receipts and instruct the University Cashier to request the services of the National Printing Office (NPO) for the printing of Accountable Form 51-C which shall be used by the University to acknowledge all forms of collections; (b) assign a duly bonded collecting officer for security reasons; and (c) instruct all collecting officers to promptly remit/deposit all collections to the Casher’s Office.



2. 	Control measures to safeguard the receipt and custody of cash collections from sales of palay and mangoes by the Agricultural Science and Technology School (ASTS) were inadequate due to (a) non-issuance of official receipts (OR) upon sale; (b) absence of fidelity bond of the School Treasurer; (c) non-remittance of cash collections to the University Cashier; (d) failure to deposit collections in an Authorized Government Depository Bank (AGDB); and (e) absence of documentation for the harvest and palay grains sold during the dry season of calendar year 2019, thus, resulting in the non-recognition of reported revenues in the books of accounts totaling to ₱5,800,327.00, and possible under-reported sales estimated at ₱5,549,665.07. (Observation No. 9)



We recommended and the Management agreed to (a) consider the designation of an authorized Collecting Officer (CO) at the ASTS who will be subsequently bonded in accordance with law, and properly trained in the handling of government funds; (b) instruct the designated CO on the proper use of authorized and pre-numbered official receipts in the collection of sales of agricultural produce; (c) direct the School Principal to immediately cause the remittance of the School collections to the University Cashier, including whatever balance was left as of examination date; (d) create a Task Force to conduct thorough investigation of the deficiencies initially noted by the Audit Team in the audit of the harvest and sales of palay from wet season 2017 to dry season 2019 where an estimated understatement in sales of ₱5,549,665.07 was discovered, as well as the reported sales of mango of undetermined amount; and (e ) cause the early submission of the results of such investigation to the Audit Team, together with an explanation why such discrepancies occurred. 



3. 	The ASTS Management continued the old practice of using its revenue as revolving funds in which collections were used outright to defray cash purchases of supplies and equipment contrary to the fundamental principles governing financial transactions as provided in Section 4 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 resulting in the (a) complete disregard of the existing Procurement Law; (b) unrecorded expenses for the period covered March 2017 to January 29, 2021 totalling to ₱5,846,885.59; (c) unrecorded equipment purchased at ₱100,800.00; (d) disbursements without any supporting documents or valid proofs of payment aggregating to ₱1,630,901.00; and (e) cash deficit of ₱130,675.78 as of examination date- January 29, 2021. (Observation No. 10)



We recommended and the Management agreed to instruct the ASTS School Principal to (a) undertake the appropriate mode of procurement of supplies and materials in keeping with R.A. No. 9184 or establish a reasonable amount of Petty Cash Fund  (PCF) to facilitate the defrayment of petty operating expenses; (b) recognize equipment purchased in the amount of ₱100,800.00; and (c) ensure that all subsequent payments are properly covered by duly approved/signed Disbursement Vouchers (DVs)/Payrolls with original copies of valid supporting documents attached to serve as basis in the evaluation of authenticity and authority of the disbursements.



The foregoing audit observations and recommendations were communicated through Audit Observation Memoranda (AOM) and discussed during the Exit Conference with concerned University officials and employees.  Their comments were incorporated in this report, where appropriate.





F)	Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges (SASDC)
