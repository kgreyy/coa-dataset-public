Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on fairness of the presentation of the financial statements of the Partido State University for CY 2020.





	Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations

	

	The following are the notable observations and the corresponding recommendations:

	

1)	Unreconciled difference of ₱1.71 million between the balance of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts in the amount of ₱704.10 million per FS and the amount of ₱702.39 million reported in the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE).



We recommended that Management require:



a)	The Inventory Committee to take more effort to identify the prior years’ unreconciled difference of ₱1.71 million and those PPEs which are still recorded in the accounting books but existence of which cannot be established anymore. Coordinate with Accounting Office on the identified differences for possible correction/adjustment in the accounting records thru Journal Entry Voucher (JEV). Also, make the necessary adjustments/corrections in the RPCPPE, if warranted; 



a)	The Accountant to prepare and maintain updated Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) per fund to facilitate reconciliation of the balances of the PPEs per books and actual inventory; 



b)	The Property/Supply Officer to maintain a complete and updated Property Cards (PC) for all the PPE assets to facilitate the reconciliation process; and



c)	The Inventory Committee to prepare a reconciliation report for submission to the Audit Team for verification and validation, reflecting the PPE balances per accounting records, property records and the actual count to identify which of the three concerned offices shall make the necessary corrections and/or adjustments.  



2)	The balance of the Accounts Receivable (AR) account of ₱17.98 million as of December 31, 2020 has an unreconciled difference of ₱324,786 with the Report on Aging of AR of ₱17.65 million.

	

We recommended to Management the following courses of action:



	   a.  Require the Accounting Unit to analyze the cause/s of the variance between the Statement of Financial Position and the supporting aging schedule;



a)	Reconcile the balances of the two records and make the necessary adjustments for fair presentation of the balance of AR in the financial statements; and



b)	Address issues and concerns on the lapses in the Student Information and Accounting System (SIAS).



3)	The University was unable to collect and recover the long outstanding balance of its Accounts Receivable from tuition fees in the amount of ₱17.98 million as of December 31, 2020, ₱3.38 million of which has been outstanding in the books for more than 10 years.



We recommended that Management take the following courses of action:



a)	Intensify collection efforts by periodically sending communications through collection/demand letters, electronic mails, etc. to those with unsettled accounts in order not to deprive the University of much needed funds to support its operations; and



b)	Review available documents relative to the dormant accounts, and in case it could no longer be collected, request from Commission on Audit (COA) for authority to write-off the accounts with complete supporting documents as required under COA Circular No. 2016-005.



4)	The University was not able to strictly require the five Associate Professors to have an approved research during the 1st semester (August 2020-December 2020) of Academic Year (AY) 2020-2021 and AY 2019-2020, contrary to the University President Memorandum No. 259, s. 2019 dated July 11, 2019, hence, payment of the corresponding compensation in the total amount of ₱399,182 was improper as the required performance and output on research were not rendered.



We recommended that the University President direct the concerned officials to comply with the submission and approval of a research output. Otherwise, the corresponding compensation shall be refunded by the concerned professors, if warranted. Likewise, monitoring on the progress and development of research assignments and accomplishments be made through regular meetings. 



It is also recommended that Management continue to screen and hire applicants for the teaching job with the needed expertise to prevent overloading of teaching loads to existing professors.



5)	Disbursement Vouchers and related supporting documents totaling ₱13.38 million were not yet submitted to the Audit Team, thus, precluded the timely determination of validity and propriety of the covering transactions and the reliability and correctness of the year-end balances of the affected accounts in the financial statements cannot be ascertained.



We recommended that Management immediately submit to the Audit Team the transaction documents aggregating ₱13.38 million pursuant to existing COA rules and regulations, otherwise this will warrant the issuance of Notice of Suspension or Disallowance.



The afore-cited observations and recommendations were discussed with concerned officials of the PSU during the exit conference held for the purpose last April 23, 2021. Management comments and reactions were considered in the report, where it is deemed appropriate.
