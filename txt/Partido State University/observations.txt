OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)	FINANCIAL AND COMPLIANCE AUDIT



1)	The University was unable to collect and recover the long outstanding balance of its Accounts Receivable from tuition fees in the amount of ₱17.98 million as of December 31, 2020, ₱3.38 million of which has been outstanding in the books for more than 10 years.  



Sections 6.1 and 7.1 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 state that: 



6.1 All government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due and demandable and that cash advances and fund transfers are liquidated within the prescribed period depending upon their nature and purpose.



Xxx



The Accountant shall:



7.1 Conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis, and validation of the existence of the receivables, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers, and determine the concerned debtors, accountable officers (Regular and Special Disbursing Officers, Collecting Officers, Cashiers) and the source and implementing government entities concerned.



Moreover, Section 8 of the same Circular provides for the procedures in the write-off of dormant accounts.



Dormant receivable accounts are defined in this Circular as accounts which balance remained inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for 10 years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.



Review of the Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020 of the PSU disclosed the balance of the Accounts Receivable pertaining to students’ tuition fees amounting to ₱17.98 million which constitutes 41.12 per cent of the total receivables of ₱43.72 million.

According to Management, as a prerequisite to the request for write-off, they sent demand letters to some of the students/debtors and their parents thru registered mail in past years; however, most of them were returned due to various reasons such as unknown address, moved out, deceased, unclaimed and the like, thus, their request for write-off did not prosper due to lack of supporting documents.



The above-mentioned condition raised doubt as to the validity and reliability of the recorded receivables. 



We recommended to Management the following courses of action:

a)	Intensify collection efforts by periodically sending communications through collection/demand letters, electronic mails, etc. to those with unsettled accounts in order not to deprive the University of much needed funds to support its operations; and

b)	Review available documents relative to the dormant accounts, and in case it could no longer be collected, request from COA for authority to write-off the accounts with complete supporting documents as required under COA Circular No. 2016-005. 



Management Comment:



Series of meetings were already conducted by the Chief Administrative Officer of Finance Division with the Campus Cashiers to discuss collection scheme to be implemented to intensify the collection process such as sending letters through postal service and using the social media to contact the students.  If after exhaustion of all remedies to collect the receivables, still to no avail, Management will opt to request for write off of dormant accounts supported with the required attachments.





2)	The balance of the Accounts Receivable (AR) account of ₱17.98 million as of December 31, 2020 has an unreconciled difference of ₱324,786 with the Report on Aging of AR of ₱17.65 million.



A sound internal control system requires that there should be adequate checking and reconciling procedure to produce accurate records. The responsibility for the fair presentation of financial statements (FS) rests with the Management of the reporting agency.



Section 6, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, enumerates the Qualitative Characteristics of Financial Reporting, among them is Reliability, described therein as follows:



Reliability – reliable information is free from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.



Likewise, Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 states that:



1)			The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.

		

		(2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.

	

The Head of the Agency has the responsibility to develop and install the internal control procedures. One of the elements of a sound internal control is that the accounting and other records should be kept up-to date, accurate and can be verified.

Verification of Accounting records and reports revealed that the balance of AR per aging report of ₱17.65 million is unreconciled with the amount presented in the Statement of Financial Position (SFP) in the amount of ₱17.98 million, showing a difference of ₱324,786. The comparison of the balances of AR between the SFP and the Aging Schedule is shown hereunder:

According to the Accounting personnel concerned, the AR balances reflected in the aging of each college/department of PSU – Goa Campus were extracted from the Student Information and Accounting System (SIAS). Data from the said system were generated based on the input by the Registrar’s Office, thus, they are amenable that there may have been erroneous entries in the system that may have caused the difference. Also, the schedule of AR for Goa Campus varies every time a report is being generated from the system. Moreover, the difference in the amount between SFP and Aging Reports has been existing for a very long time and was just carried forward in the books over the years.



Considering the foregoing circumstances and the inability of Management to monitor the recording of the transactions resulted in an unreconciled balance of ₱324,786 in the Accounts Receivable account as of December 30, 2020, the reliability of the balance as reflected in the financial statement could not be ascertained.



We recommended to Management the following courses of action:



a)	Require the Accounting Unit to analyze the cause/s of the variance between the SFP and the supporting aging schedule;



b)	Reconcile the balances of the two records and make the necessary adjustments for fair presentation of the balance of AR in the financial statements; and



c)	Address issues and concerns on the lapses in the SIAS.



Management Comment:



The Report of Aging of Accounts Receivable was generated from the SIAS. The difference may be attributed to the prior years’ data which were not reflected in the implementation of the system. Nevertheless, reconciliation of the two records shall be conducted to arrive at a reconciled amount.





3)	Unreconciled difference of ₱1.71 million between the balance of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts in the amount of ₱704.10 million per FS and the amount of ₱702.39 million reported in the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE).



	Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs states: “The Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPE Ledger Card (PPELC) for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same.  The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR).”	 



Comparison of the submitted RPCPPE against the PPE balances per Accounting records as of December 31, 2020 of the following PPE accounts showed that there is a total unreconciled difference of ₱1.71 million between the two records of the University, as follows:

It is worth mentioning that the Internal Auditor who is in-charge of the PPE inventory monitors these unreconciled differences and was able to identify some of these differences. Validation and verification conducted on the report of reconciliation submitted by the Inventory Committee disclosed that the identified errors, corresponding adjustments and covering accounting entries were accordingly and correctly effected on some of the accounts. 



Furthermore, it has been noted that there was a significant improvement on the reconciliation process of the differences of the PPE accounts balances per accounting records and inventory report, as follows:

The non-maintenance of PPELC and Property Cards for each PPE account caused difficulty in tracing the prior years’ outstanding unreconciled difference in the balances of some PPE accounts amounting to ₱1.71 million, which comprises 0.25 per cent of the total assets of the University valued at ₱686.64 million.



We recommended that Management require:



a)	The Inventory Committee to take more effort to identify the prior years’ unreconciled difference of ₱1.71 million and those PPEs which are still recorded in the accounting books but existence of which cannot be established anymore.  Coordinate with Accounting Office on the identified differences for possible correction/adjustment in the accounting records thru Journal Entry Voucher (JEV). Also, make adjustments/corrections in the RPCPPE, if warranted; 



b)	The Accountant to prepare and maintain updated PPELC per fund to facilitate reconciliation of the balances of the PPE per books and actual inventory;



c)	The Property/Supply Officer to maintain a complete and updated Property Cards for all the PPE assets to facilitate the reconciliation process; and 



d)	The Inventory Committee to prepare a reconciliation report for submission to the Audit Team for verification and validation, reflecting the PPE balances per accounting records, property records and the actual count to identify which of the three concerned offices shall make the necessary corrections and/or adjustments.  



Management Comment:



Management commits to follow the audit recommendations.





4)	Management did not fully comply with the provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 8291 or the Government Service Insurance Act, on the deduction and remittance of mandatory contributions.



		RA No. 8291 or Government Service Insurance Act of 1997 requires the mandatory monthly contributions of government employees and employers to the GSIS and the regular remittance of the same, together with the repayments of loans of the employees, if any.

			

Verification of the amounts withheld and the corresponding remittances to the GSIS revealed that the University regularly/monthly deducted the personal shares of the GSIS premiums and the loan repayments from its employees and remitted them together with the employer’s share. However, there were either under/over remittance balances noted in some of the months in CY 2020.

It can be gleaned from the above table that there are differences noted in the amounts recorded as monthly payroll deductions and government shares when compared with the actual amounts remitted disclosing either under/over remittances ranging from ₱3,423 to ₱2.93 million. An under remittance of ₱296,214 was still noted after the January 2021 remittance of ₱73,453 for the December 2020 balance was made.



Per interview with Management, the discrepancies in the amounts recorded as monthly payroll deductions and government shares against actual amounts remitted were due to the following:



a)	Unreconciled balance from previous years and was brought forward in CY 2020; 

b)	Changes in the members’ information such as salary increase, expiration of temporary assignments, hiring of new employees, etc.;

c)	Errors in the deduction for rectification; and 

d)	Refund of consolidated loans and loan deductions due to moratorium.



Sound accounting practice requires that those actually deducted from the employees be remitted to concerned agencies/entities. Since the withholding of loan repayments was adequately done for such personal loan repayments, the remittances thereof should be made in full and intact. The under remittance of the required premiums and/or contributions for GSIS deprived the employees of the loan privileges and other benefits that they may avail upon while still or outside the government service. Also, the non-remittance of amounts withheld in full and intact resulted in the abnormal monthly balances. 



We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	Ensure that correct amounts of monthly employees’ shares are deducted and remitted in full and intact to avoid inaccurate payments; and



b)	Reconcile the over/under deduction/remittance noted and furnish the Auditor with the copy of JEV for the adjusting entries to be made.



5)	Disbursements for repairs and maintenance of various machinery and equipment and transportation equipment amounting to ₱0.81 million were not supported with documents indicating the history of repair undertaken therein.



COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribes the revised guidelines and the documentary requirements for common government transactions. For Repair and Maintenance of Aircraft, Equipment and Motor Vehicles, Section 9.1.3.4 thereof requires the submission of a copy of document indicating the history of repair as attachment along with other documentary requirements.

	

The Head of the Agency has the responsibility to develop and install the internal control procedures. One of the elements of a sound internal control is that the accounting and other records should be kept up to date, accurate and can be verified.



Expenses on repairs and maintenance of various machinery and equipment and transportation equipment amounting to ₱0.81 million were not supported with maintenance/repair history records indicating the date, cost and nature (e.g. changing tire, preventive maintenance, calibration, etc.) of repairs done on each equipment/vehicle.

The repair/maintenance record is a required attachment to the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property, as it is necessary in the determination of the appraised value of the equipment/vehicle slated for disposal.



Non-compliance with the documentary requirements as enumerated in Section 9.1.3.4 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 connotes inadequacy of the internal control system of the University in handling repairs and maintenance of its government vehicles and     equipment.



We recommended that Management reconstruct the repair/maintenance record of each equipment/vehicle owned and/or operated by the University for record and reference purposes and to have an updated history of repair for each particular equipment which already underwent repair and maintenance. 

 

We also recommended that the Accounting Department refrain from processing similar claim without the required maintenance/repair history record to avoid the same deficiency in the future.



Management Comment:



The Chief Administrative Officer of Finance Division has already reminded the Accountant not to process claims for repairs/maintenance without the repair history document.  This will be coordinated with the Supply/Property Officer who is tasked to prepare the document which will be the basis of the Accountant in the posting of repair cost to the Property Equipment Card maintained by the Accounting Unit.





6)	The University was not able to require the five Associate Professors to have an approved research during the 1st semester (August 2020-December 2020) of Academic Year (AY) 2020-2021 and AY 2019-2020.



Paragraph 1.3 of University President Memorandum No. 259, s.2019 dated July, 2019 on the Revised Guidelines in Rating Faculty Performance for Fiscal Year 2019 states that:



 The new features of the revised Individual Performance Commitment Review (IPCR) guidelines are primarily in compliance with the COA observation and joint DBM- CHED-PASUC, NBC requirements for professors and associate professors prescribed thru PSU Office Memorandum No. 139 s. 2019. These significant features of the 2019 Individual Performance Commitment Review (IPCR) guidelines include:



--			70-30 allocation for associate professors (6 units of Research and Development (R & D) approved research and 12 units of instruction)

--			50-50 allocation for professors (9 units of R & D approved research and 9 units of instruction

		

The report on Research Engagement/Accomplishments of Associate Professors and Full-Fledged Professors for CY 2020 submitted by the Research and Development Office to the Audit Team, disclosed that there were five Associate Professors who were not able to deliver the required      outputs on research during the 1st semester of AY 2020-2021, as follows:

It was also learned that the same professors did not have an approved research during AY 2019-2020.



Further verification disclosed that a full pledged Professor designated as Dean and an Associate Professor with designation of Department Head were automatically eligible to deloading  of 12 units each. However, they incurred overload units during the year wherein corresponding honoraria were paid to them, despite the non-delivery of outputs for research which have mandatory allocation of nine and six units for Professor and Associate Professor, respectively. Below is the summary of expenses incurred for the honoraria paid to concerned personnel of the University:

Interview with University officials revealed that the overload in units by the above-mentioned Professors was unavoidable due to lack or absence of faculty to handle the subjects of which said Professors are experts in said field/area.



According to concerned officials of the University, the above deficiencies by some concerned professors did not affect the overall rating of the University in the number of research output completed within the year. In fact, they garnered a satisfactory rating of 148 per cent or 89    research outputs out of 60 annual targets.



However, allowing these professors to continuously disregard the University President’s Memorandum, which was based on NBC 461 and Joint DBM, CHED, and PASUC guidelines, without any sanction would be unfair to the other professors who were able to deliver the required research and to the University as it incurred expenses for their compensations on deloaded units.



We recommended that the University President direct the concerned University officials to comply with the submission and approval of a research output. Otherwise, the corresponding compensation shall be refunded by the concerned professors, if warranted. Likewise, monitoring on the progress and development of research assignments and accomplishments be made through regular meetings.



It is also recommended that Management continue to screen and hire applicants for the teaching job with the needed expertise to prevent overloading of teaching loads to existing professors.











Management Comment:



The Vice President for Research, Extension and External Affairs, Research Director and College/Campus Dean shall conduct monthly monitoring of the research implementation and accomplishment thru status reports and meetings.



	Management shall screen and hire applicants for the teaching job with the needed expertise to prevent overloading of teaching loads to existing professors.





7)	Surety bonds posted by some contractors for infrastructure projects as performance security or warranty were not sufficient or did not cover the entire defects liability period.



The pertinent provisions in the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 9184 relative to Performance Bond, are quoted as follows:



Section 39. Performance Security. 



39.1. To guarantee the faithful performance by the winning bidder of its obligations under the contract in accordance with the Bidding Documents, it shall post a performance security prior to the signing of the contract.

	

Xxx



39.4. The performance security shall remain valid until issuance by the Procuring Entity of the Certificate of Final Acceptance.



Xxx



39.6. For the procurement of Infrastructure Projects, the winning bidder shall post an additional performance security following the schedule above to cover any cumulative increase of more than ten percent (10%) over the original value of the contract as a result of amendments to order or change orders, extra work orders and supplemental agreements, as the case may be. The winning bidder shall cause the extension of the validity of the Performance Security to cover approved contract time extensions. (Emphasis supplied)



Xxx



62.2. For the procurement of Infrastructure Projects, the following warranties shall be made:



 62.2.1. From the time project construction commenced up to final acceptance, the contractor shall assume full responsibility for the following: a) any damage or destruction of the works except those occasioned by force majeure; and b) safety, protection, security, and convenience of his personnel, third parties, and the public at large, as well as the works, equipment, installation and the like to be affected by his construction work.(a)



62.2.2. One (1) year from project completion up to final acceptance or the defects liability period.



62.2.2.2. The defects liability period shall be covered by the Performance Security of the contractor required in Section 39.1 of this IRR, which shall guarantee that the contractor performs his responsibilities stated in the immediately preceding Section. If the contractor fails to comply with its obligations under Section 62.2.2.1 of this IRR, the Procuring Entity shall forfeit its performance security, subject its property(ies) to attachment or garnishment proceedings, and perpetually disqualify it from participating in any competitive bidding. All payables of the GoP in his favor shall be offset to recover the costs. (Emphasis supplied)



Section 10.5 of Annex “E” of the IRR of RA No. 9184:



The written consent of bondsmen must be attached to any request of the contractor for extension of contract time and submitted to the procuring entity for consideration and the validity of the performance security shall be correspondingly extended.



Based on the foregoing regulations, the validity of the performance bond should be more than one year, as follows:



1)	The construction period of the project 

2)	One year after completion of the project

3)	Contract time extensions, if any



In our review of the implementation of completed infrastructure projects based on the submitted Accomplishment Report for Infrastructure Projects during CY 2020 and documents submitted for contract review, we noted that the surety bonds being submitted as performance bond did not cover the entire warranty period as their validity was only one year. The evidence of our audit observations on performance bonds is summarized in the following matrix:

These deficiencies are indicative that the University is not fully compliant with the regulations relative to this kind of warranty, thus, the Agency is at a disadvantage because of the risk that it may not be able to avail of this remedy in case of inability of the concerned contractors to finish the projects, correct defects or comply with its obligations after the expiration of the surety bonds. 



Also, absence of a monitoring mechanism by the Physical Plant Facilities (PPF) and Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) with regard to the performance bond coverage of all on-going infrastructure projects resulted in its inability to monitor and require concerned contractors to submit extension of the validity of the performance securities once expired. 



In view thereof, we recommended that Management take the following courses of action:



a)	Direct the PPF and BAC to require the concerned contractors to post additional performance bond to cover up to the date of final acceptance and furnish the Auditor a copy thereof;



b)	For succeeding infrastructure projects, ensure that the validity of surety bonds posted by contractors as Performance Bond shall cover the entire warranty period thereof which is from the time the construction commenced up to final acceptance; and



c)	Designate personnel to monitor the implementation of infrastructure projects to ensure that the contractors are informed and required to renew their performance securities before its expiration.



Management Comment:



Management commits to follow the audit recommendations.





8)	Construction Safety and Health Programs (CSHP) for infrastructure projects were not prepared and approved by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).



Under Section 37.2.3(f) of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, one of the documents that shall form part of the contract is the construction safety and health program approved by the DOLE.



Concomitantly, Article 162, Chapter 2, Title I of Book Four of the Labor Code of the Philippines mandates the Secretary of Labor and Employment to issue orders that will set and enforce mandatory occupational safety and health standards to eliminate or reduce occupational safety and health hazards in all work places and institute new, and update existing, programs to ensure safe and healthful working conditions in all places of employment.



Pursuant thereto, Section 5 of DOLE Department Order No. 13, Series of 1998 provides that “Every construction project shall have a suitable Construction Safety and Health Program, which must be in accordance with these rules, and other orders and issuances issued by the DOLE. xxx”



Further, Section 6 of the same Department Order provides that: “all employers must provide personal protective equipment for all employees needing such equipment. All other persons entering the construction site must wear the necessary protective equipment. The equipment cost for the provision of PPE shall be an integral part of the project cost.”



Verification of sample transactions for CY 2020 disclosed that contractors of the following infrastructure projects did not comply with the above-cited regulations, to wit:



Project Title

Retrofitting of Gabaldon Type Building (Administration Building)-Goa

The Audit Team noted that no CSHP was prepared and signed by the Project Manager/Contractor and received and approved by the DOLE as part of the contract in the infrastructure projects of the University but there were provisions for construction safety and health in the bill of quantities submitted as part of the attachments for the infrastructure projects.



The inability of the contractors to secure DOLE’s approval of the CSHP exposed the University to absence of official standards within which the contractor’s commitment in ensuring the safety of its workers and the public in general while the project is being implemented shall be measured.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the BAC to compel the concerned contractors of the aforementioned projects to submit immediately the CSHP. Henceforth, ensure that all approved contracts for projects implemented are supported with a DOLE-approved Construction Safety and Health Program pursuant to Section 37.2.3 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184.







9)	Disbursement Vouchers and related supporting documents totaling ₱13.38 million were not yet submitted to the Audit Team.



COA Circular No. 2009-006 dates September 15, 2009 prescribed the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts. Section 7.2.1 thereof states that: 



The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that: 



a. The reports and supporting documents by the accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month.



Section 43(4) of PD No. 1445 otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines provides that: 



The auditors in all auditing units shall have the custody, and be responsible for the safekeeping and preservation of paid expense vouchers, journal vouchers, stubs of treasury warrants or checks, reports of collections and disbursements and similar documents together with their respective supporting papers. 



Verification of the submission of accounts for CY 2020 disclosed that various check disbursement vouchers and related supporting documents covering CY 2020 transactions totaling ₱13.38 million were not yet submitted to COA for audit and examination purposes. Below is the summary of unsubmitted vouchers per fund with the details shown in Annex A, viz:

The incomplete submission thereof within the prescribed period as required under existing regulations hindered the Audit Team in the conduct of timely audit and examination to determine the validity and propriety of these transactions. Likewise, the reliability and correctness of the year-end balances of the affected accounts in the financial statements cannot be ascertained.



We recommended that Management immediately submit to the Audit Team the transaction documents aggregating ₱13.38 million pursuant to existing COA rules and regulations, otherwise this will warrant the issuance of Notice of Suspension or Disallowance.



Management Comment:



Out of 653 total unsubmitted Disbursement vouchers, 15 were already submitted to COA Audit Team and the remaining 638 were still in the custody of the Cashiering Unit.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



A very low percentage equivalent to 2.3 per cent only of the 653 disbursement vouchers were submitted despite the audit observation communicated to Management which is an indication of Management’s lapses and disregard of the existing regulation on the submission of accounts to COA.





A)	COMPLIANCE WITH GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT



10)	The University properly appropriated and utilized its GAD Plan and Budget for CY 2020.



Pertinent provisions of the Joint Circular No. 2012-01 of the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) are as follows:



6.1 At least five percent of the total agency budget appropriations authorized under the annual GAA shall correspond to activities supporting GAD plans and programs. Xxx



6.3 The utilization and outcome of the GAD budget shall be annually monitored and evaluated in terms of its success in influencing the gender-responsive implementation of agency programs funded by the remaining ninety-five percent (95%) budget (MCW Chapter VI, Sec. 36) 



Also, Section 32 of the General Provisions of General Appropriations Act for FY 2019 provides that:



All agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Implementation of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).

	

	The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which shall relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirements. Utilization of GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.



Relative information on GAD appropriation and utilization for CY 2020 are as follows:

PSU’s Total Appropriation

₱ 354,921,000.00

Actual GAD Budget 

₱   17,742,050.00

% of Actual GAD Budget to Total Agency’s Appropriations

5.00%

Actual GAD Expenditure 

₱   28,262,909.15

% of Actual GAD Expenditure to Actual GAD Budget

159.30%



	As presented in the table above, the actual GAD expenditures for CY 2020 amounting to ₱28.26 million is 159.30 per cent of the actual GAD Budget due to mainstreaming of the University’s Programs, Activities and Projects (PAPs) to attain the desired outcome for GAD. Mainstreaming is a way for the University to influence the entire program, plan and budget.



We recommended that Management continue to comply with the provisions of Joint Circular No. 2012-01 of the PCW, DBM and NEDA on the formulation of GAD Plan and Budget as well as the full implementation of the programs/projects/activities attributed to GAD.





B)	COVID-19 EXPENSES



In compliance with the government’s directive on the COVID-19 health responses by government agencies, related transactions were incurred by PSU as follows: 



a)	Ten percent discontinuance in the amounts corresponding to FY 2020 released allotments for Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) and Capital Outlay (CO) as per Section 4.3 of the National Budget Circular No. 580 dated April 22, 2020 re: Adoption of Economy Measures in the Government Due to the Emergency Health Situation.

b)	Payment of hazard pay in the total amount of ₱354,000 to selected personnel for services rendered for the period March 17 to April 13, 2020 during the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) per Administrative Order No. 26 dated March 23, 2020.  



c)	Procurement of medical supplies and disinfecting solutions (disposable face masks, alcohol, chlorine, thermal scanner, chlorine, soap, medicines, etc.)  worth ₱0.76 million.



d)	Food allowance of stranded OJT students in dormitories/boarding houses in Metro Manila was ₱42,000.



Disbursement Vouchers and its supporting papers relative to the foregoing transactions were audited and found proper and complete. 





C)	COMPLIANCE WITH TAX LAWS



For CY 2020, PSU withheld the total amount of ₱23.61 million from its employees’ compensation, percentage taxes and value added taxes on its various suppliers/contractors. Details on the remittances made during the year and the unremitted balance as of December 31, 2020 are shown below:
