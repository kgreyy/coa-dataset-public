Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements for the CY 2020 due to the following audit observations:



			1)	The accuracy of the balances of the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Accounts (CIB-LCCA) of the College as of December 31, 2020, amounting to ₱71.47 million could not be ascertained in view of the material variance of ₱41.11 million between the book and bank records due to the inability to update and/or prepare the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) for three bank accounts and non-reconciliation of Cash in Bank balances in the general and subsidiary ledgers of the different departments and campuses with a variance of ₱156,739. 



			2)	The existence, accuracy and reliability of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts valued in the books at ₱607.89 million (excluding Land, Land Improvements and Infrastructure Assets) could not be determined and ascertained due to: a.) Unreconciled variance of ₱30.99 million between the balance in the Financial Statements (FS) and Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE); and b.) Buildings account totaling ₱480.61 million in the Statement of Financial Position (SFP) was unreliable due to inclusion of the value of demolished buildings amounting to ₱2.55 million, resulting in the overstatement of assets by the same amount and accumulated depreciation by ₱1.47 million.



			3)	Inclusion of obligations not yet due and demandable amounting to ₱101.74 million and non-recording of its obligation to pay for the completion of project amounting to ₱1.36 million, in the year-end balance of Accounts Payable totaling ₱207.77 million, overstated and understated, respectively, the Accounts Payable account, affecting the fair presentation thereof in the financial statements.















Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



For the exceptions mentioned earlier, the Auditor recommended that Management:



			1)	Require the College Accountant to religiously prepare and submit the required Monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements for all the bank accounts maintained in accordance with the above-cited rules and regulations and to check/verify the discrepancies between the balances reflected in the SFP and the books of the different departments and campuses of the College. Noted discrepancies shall be adjusted accordingly.



2.a. Require the Inventory Committee to conduct a thorough review of the RPCPPE by conducting actual count, validation, verification and inspection of PPE owned by the College;



   b. Maintain complete and updated Property Cards and perform periodic reconciliation to ensure that all discrepancies are immediately investigated, cleared and reconciled with the books of accounts; and



   c. Derecognize the three demolished buildings and coordinate with the concerned office for the determination of other demolished buildings still existing in the books, to correct the overstatement of PPE accounts.



3.a. Stop the practice of recording procured goods/services/projects which were not yet delivered/rendered/completed and accepted as Accounts Payable, regardless of the year when these obligations were incurred, and make the necessary adjusting entries for the inclusion to the Accounts Payable account of the obligation not yet due and demandable amounting to ₱101.74 million;



  b. Verify and secure the necessary documents prior to recording of obligations in the Accounts Payable account in the books of the Agency;



   c. Secure the Certificate of Completion for the Repair of College of Business and Public Administration (CBPA) Building and once established, make the necessary entry for the recognition of accounts payable amounting to ₱1.36 million; and



  d. Strictly adhere to the guidelines provided in the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) in the recognition of accounts payable and COA Accounting Circular Letter No. 2007-002 on the preparation of List of Not Yet Due and Demandable Obligations and disclosure thereof in the Notes to Financial Statements.



Moreover, the following are the other notable observations and recommendations: 



						1)	Copies of contracts together with their supporting documents totaling ₱113.68 million were not submitted for contract review and evaluation within the prescribed period. Likewise, no requests for technical inspection were submitted for completed projects, contrary to COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, thereby, depriving Management of the opportunity to be informed of the deficiencies, if any, at the earliest time possible.



We recommended that Management comply with the regulations and furnish the Audit Team with the required copy of contracts along with their supporting documents within the prescribed period for the timely review and evaluation. Likewise, submit requests for inspection of completed projects to the Commission on Audit thru the Audit Team.



			2)	The performance security posted by the Contractors of various projects expired before the final acceptance thereof, contrary to Sections 39.4 and 39.6 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (R-IRR) of RA No. 9184, thus, exposing the College to risks, in case of inability of the concerned contractors to finish the projects, correct defects or comply with its obligations under the bidding documents.

	

We recommended that Management take the following courses of action:



				a)	Require the concerned contractors to renew/extend its performance bond and furnish the Auditor a copy thereof; and



				b)	Designate personnel to monitor the implementation of infrastructure projects to ensure that the contractors are informed and required to renew their performance securities before its expiration.



			3)	Inconsistency of the duration for the project “Completion of Supply Office with Stock Room and Garage (Phase 2)” indicated in the Program of Works (POW), Invitation to Bid (ITB) and Contract Agreement was noted due to inability of Management to check the accuracy of data not in keeping with Section 20.1 (a) Rule VII of the R-IRR of R.A. No. 9184. Also, Disbursement Voucher for the final payment and other related documents remained unsubmitted affecting the timely post-audit and evaluation of the completed project.

		

We recommended that Management instruct the BAC to ensure that all data relating to the procurement of infrastructure projects are thoroughly verified and crossed-check with other documents. Also, require the Accountant and other officials concerned to submit immediately the unsubmitted disbursement voucher and supporting documents to the Audit Team for post audit.



			4)	The following deficiencies were noted in the procurement of various goods, contrary to pertinent provisions of the R-IRR of RA No. 9184, thus, compliance to procedural guidelines in the manner prescribed by the procurement law and related issuances in order to promote competition, economy, efficiency and transparency in the procurement process, was not assured:



				a)	Inability of the BAC to attach the Invitation and Minutes of Pre-procurement conference for contracts to be bid with above ₱2.00 million Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC) as required in Section 20 of the R-IRR of RA No. 9184.



				b)	Print-outs of the Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System (PhilGEPS) posting of ITB have pending, in-preparation, closed or failed status. 

 

				c)	Period for the conduct of re-bidding and negotiated procurement under Two-Failed Biddings modality was not adhered by the College in the procurement of various goods contrary to Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Circular No. 05-2016 dated December 20, 2016, thus, efficiency of the procurement process was not ensured.



In view of the foregoing, we recommended the following:



							a)	Require the BAC to observe Section 20 of the IRR of RA No. 9184 and justify their inability to conduct the pre-procurement conference for the procurement of goods with an Approved Budget for the Contract of more than ₱2.00 million; 



							b)	Implement a strict and comprehensive controls for the proper documentation of the disbursement; 



							c)	In all procurement related activities, strictly comply with the provisions of RA No. 9184 and the R-IRR; and



							d)	Require the BAC to adhere to the prescribed period for the conduct of re-bidding and negotiated procurement under two failed biddings modality.



			5)	Several infrastructure projects with total contract cost of ₱103.73 million awarded to same contractor showed overlapping of contract implementation with same key personnel assigned and equipment to be utilized due to lapses in the post-qualification process, thus, may affect the capability of the contractor to satisfactorily complete the project on time depriving the College the benefit to use the same at the earliest possible time.



We recommended that Management comply the following:



				a)	Require the contractors to augment their manpower and/or equipment to be utilized in the projects awarded to them which have the same or overlapping period of implementation to expedite the completion thereof; and 



				b)	Henceforth, direct the BAC and its TWG to carefully examine the contractor’s manpower and equipment on all the projects to be awarded and not on individual project only in case the contractor is the lowest bidder in several projects which have the same or overlapping period of implementation. 



			6)	Prior year’s expenses totaling ₱5.18 million that were not booked up as Accounts Payable during that year were improperly charged against the current year’s appropriations and accounts under Internally Generated Fund of the College, contrary to Section 119 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, Section 6, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, and Section 25 of Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Memorandum Order No. 20 series of 2011, resulting in overstatement of the respective expenses accounts,  understatement of Equity and depleted the budget for CY 2020.



We recommended that Management take the following courses of action:



				a)	Direct the Budget Officer to enforce the compliance of the deadline of submission of valid claims by officials and employees before year-end to ensure that transactions and events are obligated within the period to which they relate/incurred to avoid the improper use of the current year’s appropriations for un-booked prior year’s obligations pursuant to Section 119 of PD No. 1445;



				b)	Direct the Accounting Office to comply with the accrual basis of accounting by ensuring that all due and demandable obligations of the College, duly obligated during the year that they are incurred by the Budget Office, are accounted for as Accounts Payable in the books; and



				c)	Ensure that transactions are properly supported with complete documentation before payment of claims to avoid suspension thereof in audit.



			7)	Corona Virus Disease (COVID) 19 hazard pay amounting to ₱0.54 million was granted to employees of the College during the period of declared General Community Quarantine (GCQ) and Modified General Community Quarantine (MGCQ), contrary to Administrative Order No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 and Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Budget Circular No. 1 dated March 24, 2020, rendering irregularity of the transaction.



We recommended that Management strictly adhere with pertinent issuances relative to COVID 19 particularly on the grant of hazard pay. It is also recommended to submit the office order/approved authority of employees assigned to report as Skeleton Work Force (SWF) during the period May to June 2020 as well as the MOA identifying CNSC campuses as Community Isolation Units (CIUs) for the said period.



The afore-cited observations and recommendations were discussed with concerned officials of the Camarines Norte State College during the exit conference held on March 12, 2021. Management views and reactions were considered in the Report, where it is deemed appropriate.
