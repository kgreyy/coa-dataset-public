OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)	FINANCIAL AUDIT



			1)	Petty Cash Fund (PCF) was not replenished upon reaching 75 per cent of disbursements and was closed at year end by submitting liquidation report.

 

Paragraph 4.3.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002 provides that the cash advance shall be sufficient for the recurring expenses of the agency for one month. The Accountable Officer (AO) may request replenishment of the cash advance when the disbursements reach at least 75 per cent or as the need requires, by submitting a replenishment voucher with all supporting documents duly summarized in a report of disbursements.



Likewise, Section 35, Chapter 6 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, states that the PCF to be set up shall be sufficient for the recurring petty operating expenses of the agency for one month. It shall be maintained using the Imprest System. All replenishments shall be directly charged to the expense account and at all times, the PCF shall be equal to the total cash on hand and the unreplenished expenses. The PCF shall be replenished as soon as disbursements reach at least 75 per cent or as needed.



Further, Section 35 (b) of the same Manual provides that the unused balance of the PCF shall not be closed/refunded at the end of the year. The fund shall be closed only upon termination, separation, retirement or dismissal of the Petty Cash Fund Custodian (PCFC), who in turn shall refund any balance to close his/her cash accountability.



During the conduct of cash examination and upon verification of disbursements and replenishments of the PCF, the Audit Team noted that the designated Petty Cash Custodians were not able to immediately replenish the fund even when disbursements already reach more than 75 per cent contrary to the above cited provisions. Also, the Accountable Officers closed the PCF at year-end by submitting a liquidation report to the accounting department, contrary to Section 35(b), Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.



The inability of the PCFCs to replenish when the disbursements already reached at least 75 per cent defeated the purpose of the establishment of the fund of providing immediate cash resource when the need arises. 



We recommended that Management take the following courses of action:



a)	The PCFCs request replenishment of the PCF upon reaching 75 per cent of disbursements by submitting a replenishment voucher together with the required supporting documents; and 



b)	Unused balance of PCF shall not be closed/refunded at the end of the year. Instead, the PCFCs shall submit to the Accounting Division/Unit as at year-end all unreplenished Petty Cash Vouchers (PCVs) for proper recording in the books of accounts.



Management Comment:



Management informed the Audit Team that the PCFCs has already been instructed that upon reaching 75 per cent of disbursements, they shall submit a replenishment vouchers together with the required supporting documents so that provision of immediate cash resource for the purpose of this PCF is achieved.



Likewise, the PCFCs have already been informed to submit to the Accounting Office as at year-end all unreplenished PCVs for proper recording in the books of accounts.





			2)	The accuracy of the balances of the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Accounts (CIB-LCCA) as of December 31, 2020, amounting to ₱71.47 million could not be ascertained in view of the material variance of ₱41.11 million between the book and bank records and non-reconciliation of Cash in Bank balances in the general and subsidiary ledgers of the different department and campuses, with a variance of ₱156,739.



Section 74 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 states that: “At the close of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition of the agency account standing on their books. The head of the agency shall see to it that a reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the reports and the balance found in the books of the agency.”



Review of the Statement of Financial Position of the College as of December 31, 2020 showed CIB-LCCA balances of the 12 bank accounts of the College totalling ₱71.47 million. However, confirmation with the banks disclosed 13 bank accounts, one from Landbank of the Philippines (LBP) and 12 bank accounts from Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP). Analysis of the confirmation of bank balances as of December 31, 2020 revealed variance of ₱41.11 million between the book and bank records as follows:

 As shown in the table, balances of three bank accounts maintained in the LBP and DBP had discrepancies with the reported balances in the financial statement (FS). Verification of records revealed that while accounts from the different departments and campuses of the College have Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) prepared as of December 31, 2020, other accounts such as the LBP Account No. 0412-1054-60 and DBP Account No. 00-0-00296-610-9 were not updated, with available BRS as of September 30, 2020 and November 30, 2020, respectively. Likewise, DBP Account No. 002-00028-610-8 with a balance of ₱9,600 per bank confirmation was not recognized in the books of the College.



Further examination revealed that balances per schedule of the Cash in Bank account in the Statement of Financial Position have discrepancies with the balances in the subsidiary ledgers particularly on the different departments and campuses as shown below:

The non-preparation of the required monthly BRS or the delay in the submission of the same to the Office of the Auditor has deprived the latter on the timely review and verification thereof and consequently, the early communication of the results to Management. Further the unreconciled differences between the book and bank records as well as the balances between the book and the reported Cash in Bank balances in the Statement of Financial Position (SFP) casted doubts on the accuracy thereof in the financial statements. 

We recommended that Management require the College Accountant to religiously prepare and submit the required Monthly BRS for all the bank accounts maintained in accordance with the afore-cited rules and regulations and to check/verify the discrepancies between the balances reflected in the SFP and the books of the different departments and campuses of the College. Noted discrepancies shall be adjusted accordingly.



Management Comment:



The Accounting Office through the assigned Accountants and all the delivery units through their respective Bookkeepers have been directed to religiously prepare and submit BRS to ensure the accuracy of recording in the Cash in Bank accounts of the College.



The Cashier’s Office has been instructed to coordinate to the Authorized Servicing Banks if there is an online facility to facilitate data gathering of details of deposits and withdrawals so that cash transactions can in real time be easily tracked to prevent the significant delay in the issuance of bank statement which is salient in the timely preparation of BRS.





			3)	Non-compliance with the rules and regulations on cash advances resulted in control weaknesses over the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances.



a)	Cash advances granted to Accountable Officers of the College were being transferred to and utilized by another personnel. 

 

Section 4.1.5 of COA Circular No. 97-002 provides that only duly appointed or designated disbursing officers may perform disbursing functions.



Also, Section 4.1.6 of the same Circular provides that transfer of cash advance from one AO to another shall not be allowed. 



During the conduct of cash examination of various accountable officers of the College, one AO handling petty cash fund for petty operating expenses of the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) was not able to immediately present her accountabilities to the Audit Team. The AO admitted that the cash advances granted in her name were entrusted to the Dean of the college, who actually disburses the funds for the specific purpose they were granted. Although the AO made sure that prompt liquidation thereof was made, entrusting the disbursing function for the cash advance connotes transfer of cash accountability, contrary to Section 4.1.6 of the above COA Circular, which states that transfer of cash advance from one AO to another shall not be allowed.



The AO is reminded that accountability for the liquidation of the cash advances is under her responsibility being the person granted with the cash advance, thus, reliance on the respective Office who has control of disbursing the cash advance to submit the necessary documents is not proper.



The aforementioned practice is contrary to the rules and regulations in the granting, utilization of cash advance and the procedure applied exposes the government funds to possible risk of loss and/or misappropriations. 



We recommended that Management require the Accountable Officers to stop the practice of transferring her actual custody of cash to another Accountable Officers. Designate additional Special Disbursing Officers (SDO)/PCFC to handle the disbursing functions for other special programs and activities of the College. 



Management Comment:



The SDO for CAS has already been directed to stop the practice of transferring actual custody of cash to CAS Dean or her staff. A new SDO/PCF for CAS shall be designated relinquishing the current SDO/PCFC of CAS to handle the disbursing functions for other special programs and activities. 



b)	Several SDOs were unable to maintain Cash Disbursement Record (CDR) to record the grants and liquidations of cash advances.



Item 6 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 prescribes the following:



6.1	A newly-appointed or designated AO shall start with a new cashbook. Before discharging his duties, the new AO shall be briefed by the Accountant and the Auditor on the proper recording of the transactions and other matters related to his work. 

 

6.2	The AO shall maintain separate cashbooks for salaries, wages, allowances, etc. and for petty operating expenses. The AO shall record the transactions in the prescribed cashbook daily. He may record each invoice/receipt/voucher individually or the total disbursements for the day depending on the volume of the transactions. 

 

6.3 	The AO shall reconcile the book balance with the cash on hand daily. He shall foot and close the books at the end of each month. The AO and the Accountant shall reconcile their books of accounts at least quarterly. 

  

6.4 	The Cashbook shall be kept at the Office of the AO and then placed inside the safe or cabinet when not in use. It may be taken from her/his custody only by the Auditor or an official duly authorized by the Agency Head, who shall issue the necessary receipt. 

Likewise, Section 32, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, requires that the SDO shall maintain the CDR to monitor and control the granting and utilization of cash advance.



However, during the conduct of cash examination, several designated SDOs were unable to present their respective CDR, hence, cash advances received, payments made and the subsequent liquidations thereof for the period covered by the cash examination cannot be readily established and reconciled with the Accounting records. Instead, their liquidation reports were directly submitted to the Accounting Section for accounting purposes.



The absence of these record precludes the Agency from monitoring its financial resources as it poses difficulty in establishing the cash accountabilities of each and every AO at any given time. 



We recommended that Management direct the SDOs to immediately prepare and maintain CDRs for cash advances by Fund Cluster, to record all transactions thereof and ensure that these are updated regularly. 



Management Comment:



According to Management, all SDOs have immediately been directed to prepare, maintain and update their CDR with its supporting documents for cash advances by fund cluster. The College Accountant shall also notify/follow-up the concerned SDOs on the proper maintenance of CDRs.

 

c)	Cash advances were not liquidated within the prescribed period.

 

Section 89 of PD No. 1445 states that “No cash advance shall be given unless for a legally authorized specific purpose. A cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served. Xxx”



Likewise, Item 5.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002 provides that the AO shall liquidate his cash advance as follows:



5.1.1 Salaries, wages, etc. - within five (5) days after each fifteen (15) day/end of the month pay period.



5.1.2 Petty Operating Expenses and Field Operating Expenses - within twenty (20) days after the end of the year; subject to replenishment as frequently as necessary during the year.



Xxx



Also, COA Circular No. 2012-004 states that cash advances must, as a rule, be liquidated within the prescribed period depending upon the nature and purpose of the cash advance (e.g., for salaries and wages, petty and field operating expenses, local travel and foreign travel). Included among the operating expenses are cash advances for the payment of honoraria and similar payments to officials and employees, operating expenditures for special projects and activities like anniversary celebration, and special purpose and time bound activity like cultural and athletic activities. These must be liquidated within twenty (20) days from accomplishment of the purpose.



Analysis of the cash advances and liquidations disclosed that the disbursing officers of the College were unable to liquidate their cash advances within the prescribed period.



As soon as the purpose for which the cash advance was granted has been served, the cash advance should be reported or properly liquidated. There is no more reason for the AO to still keep the unspent balances as these amounts could not be used for other purposes. The holding of such amounts for extended period will only expose government funds to unnecessary risks of loss or misuse. It may also confuse the AO considering that one AO holds various funds under their custody and the possibility that such excess monies may be mixed with their personal monies.



The Audit Team also noted that some cash advances were liquidated partially in documents and refund of cash. The partial liquidation of cash advance indicates that cash advance was more than what is needed in the activities/project and may also result in the use of government fund for other activities not related to the project. Cash advance no longer needed must be returned or refunded immediately to prevent misuse.



The abovementioned practice contravenes with the rules and regulations on the granting, utilization of cash advances and exposes the government funds to possible risk of loss and/or misuse. 



We recommended that Management require the SDOs to liquidate their cash advances as soon as the purpose for which they were granted has been served. Henceforth, strictly enforce the rules and regulations on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances in accordance with COA Circular No.  97-002.



Management Comment:



Management agreed to strictly adhere with the recommendations. The Accounting Office, as part of monitoring shall require the concerned SDOs to liquidate their cash advances as soon as the purpose for which it was granted has been served.





			4)	Inability to collect school fees from students amounting to ₱53.11 million deprived the College of additional revenues and receivables outstanding or dormant for more than ten years in the amount of ₱2.22 million remained in the books.



Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 prescribes the guidelines and procedures on the write-off of dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers of NGAs, Local Government Units (LGUs) and Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs). Dormant receivable accounts are defined in this circular as accounts which balance remained inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for 10 years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.



Item 6.1 of the Circular requires all government entities to conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due and demandable. Item 7.1 of the same Circular also demands the Accountants of government agencies to regularly conduct verification, analysis and validation of the existence of receivables.



Review of the Statement of Financial Position of the Camarines Norte State College (CNSC) as of September 30, 2020 disclosed the balance of the accounts receivable pertaining to payment of school fees amounting to ₱53.11 million which constitutes 93 per cent of the total receivables of ₱57.28 million or 5.47 per cent of the total asset of ₱970.24 million. Details of the account is presented hereunder:

Verification of the balance of receivables, excluding the receivables from CHED Unifast, revealed that of the ₱16.16 million receivables from students in different colleges and campuses of CNSC, ₱2.22 million were identified as outstanding or dormant for more than 10 years as reflected in the submitted Schedule of Accounts Receivable. 



The Accounts Receivable, which remained outstanding for period ranging from below 90 days to over 10 years, is summarized as follows:

The inability of the College to effectively enforce collection of school fees from students deprived the College of additional resources that can be used to finance their other programs, projects and activities. Further verification revealed that ₱15,955 receivables from 10 students in CY 2017 in the CoTT, Jose Panganiban Campus were inadvertently omitted from the computation of the total receivables from the said campus, thus, understating the recorded accounts receivable balance by the same amount.  



It is worthy to note that this observation on dormant accounts is a reiteration of prior year’s audit findings wherein the previous Audit Team recommended for Management to make the necessary request for write-off of dormant receivables from tuition and other fees following the guidelines set forth in COA Circular No. 2016-005 in order to clear the receivable account. 



According to Management, to facilitate the request in accordance with the guidelines, they sent statement of accounts to 496 students thru mail in CYs 2018 and 2019, however, only 210 were returned due to unknown address, moved out, deceased, unclaimed and the like, thus, their request for write-off did not prosper due to lack of supporting documents. The lack or incomplete supporting documents for the request was also communicated to Management in the CY 2019 audit as embodied in the Annual Audit Report (AAR) and Management assured submission of the applicable documentary requirements enumerated under Item No. 8.3 of the above-cited circular. However, no documents were submitted yet as of this writing.



The aforesaid condition raised doubt as to the validity of the recorded receivables. The propriety of their classification as to current assets in the financial statements did not conform with the generally accepted accounting principles and the requirements of law as stated above.



We recommended that Management intensify collection efforts by periodically sending communications through collection/demand letters, electronic mails, etc. to those with unsettled accounts in order not to deprive the College of much needed funds to support its operations. Further, review available documents relative to the dormant accounts, and in case it could no longer be collected, request from COA for an authority to write-off the accounts with complete supporting documents as required under COA Circular No. 2016-005.





Management Comment:



The Registrar’s Office has been helping the Accounting Office in tracing the addressee of other students based on their records. However, they have mentioned that there is a probability that other records needed for determining the required information were damaged by previous typhoons. The Registrar’s Office will forward the list to Accounting Office as soon they have finalized the same based on available data.



Further, they asserted that they have already requested to COA for write-off of dormant accounts receivable. However, it was returned due to non-compliance of other documentary requirements. Concerned offices will convene to determine the status of compliance of documentary requirements and will soon re-forward its request for write-off. Also, the Accounting Office has immediately been directed to make the necessary adjustments in the reconciliation of accounts receivable account.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Audit Team emphasized that Management must ensure that all means and efforts are exhausted and all documents secured as evidence of remote collectability for the accounts receivable to be considered dormant and to facilitate the request for write off. 





			5)	The accuracy, reliability and validity of the Accounts Receivable account for payment of tuition and other school fees could not be ascertained due to existence of negative balance of ₱1.57 million. 



Accounts Receivable account is used to recognize the amount due from customers arising from regular trade and business transactions. Any collection of receivables, transfers or write-off is credited to this account.



A sound internal control system requires that there should be adequate checking and reconciling procedure to produce accurate records. The responsibility for the fair presentation of financial statements rests with the Management of the reporting agency.



Section 6, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I enumerates the Qualitative Characteristics of Financial Reporting, among them is Reliability, described therein as follows:



Reliability – reliable information is free from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.



Likewise, Section 111 (2) of PD No. 1445 provides that “the highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.”

Analysis of the Schedule of Accounts Receivable revealed that the account consists of both unsettled accounts and negative balances of students. Total negative balances amounted to ₱1.57 million, as shown below:



Department/Campus

Amount (₱)

College of Arts and Sciences (CAS)

186,129.19

Institute of Fisheries and Marine Sciences (IFMS)

48,695.00

TOTAL

1,574,231.33



These credit or negative balances are abnormal and uncommon and reduced the balance of the receivable accounts by the same amount which adversely affected the fair presentation of the account.	



Further verification of records relative to the negative/abnormal balance of the receivable account disclosed that the negative balances ranges from ₱2.50 to as much as ₱15,000. There were also some undetermined balances identified only as “Test” included in the accounts receivable account.



According to the Accounting personnel concerned, the accounts receivable balances reflected in the financial statements as receivables from students were extracted from the Student Information and Accounting System (SIAS). Data from the said system were generated based on the input by the different department and campuses of the assessment and collection, thus, they are amenable that there may have been erroneous entries in the system that caused the abnormal balances. Also, the schedule of receivables submitted was not as of the given date as indicated in the report, that is, as of September 30, 2020 but the balances reflected was actually as of the date of submission in October 2020 because the system could not generate the needed data as of that period.



Considering the foregoing circumstances and the inability of Management to monitor recording of the transactions resulting in negative balance in the accounts receivable account amounting to ₱1.57 million as of September 30, 2020, the reliability of the balances thereof reflected in the financial statement could not be ascertained.



We reiterated our previous recommendations for Management to take the following courses of action:



a)	Monitor and reconcile the Accounts Receivable account to determine the cause of the abnormal balances and effect necessary adjustments; and



b)	Address issues and concerns on the lapses in the information and accounting system.



Management Comment:



With regard to the Information Technology (IT) concerns, the Management Information System (MIS) Officer averred the following situations might have caused the balances in the SIAS:



			1)	Some students might not have tagged yet in the Free Higher Education during enrolment process.

			2)	Some students might not have enrolled yet in the system.

			3)	Some students might already be tagged to Free Tuition Scheme in the system but have applied for another scholarship grant in another government institution.

			4)	Some students might have incomplete assessment yet.



Per response of the Accountant, some of the negative balances were due to overpayment of students and for refund to them.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Audit Team recommended that Management take also into consideration all personnel that will be in-charge in the encoding and operation of the system.





			6)	Inadequate monitoring and unavailability of documents for loans granted to students under various loan programs of the CHED resulted in long outstanding receivable balance.



Verification of the Loans Receivable account amounting to ₱1.18 million as of November 30, 2020 disclosed that the balances pertain to loan assistance to students under the various programs of the CHED as shown below:

To determine the effectiveness and accomplishment of program objectives, the Audit Team conducted an analysis of these accounts, viz: 



	a)	Student Assistance Fund for Education (SAFE) for Loan 



CHED Memorandum No. 25, series of 2008 stipulates the guidelines for the implementation of SAFE for loan program. This program caters to students in financial need who are in their 3rd, 4th, 5th or graduating year of study. The loan grant may be used for tuition and other school fees, books and course projects, thesis writing, board and lodging, graduation fees and other valid related educational expenses. Qualified loan grantees can borrow as much as Eight Thousand Pesos (₱8,000.00), depending on individual circumstances and requirements. The loans granted to students shall be interest free and will be paid within two to five years after graduation.



Item IX of the same Memorandum also provides the duties and responsibilities involved in the implementation and administration of the program. 



	B. Participating Higher Education Institution-shall perform the following:



xxx

ii. Treat the fund transferred from CHED Regional Office as Revolving Fund to expand the number of beneficiaries of the SAFE Loan Program;

xxx 

v. Draw corresponding duly notarized promissory note for repayment within 2 to 5 years after graduation, duly signed by the student borrower when grant of loan is awarded;

xxx

viii. Maintain separate accounting records for the program that will be subjected to periodic monitoring by CHED and/or COA Audit Teams;

Based on the report submitted by the Agency to CHED Regional Office, a total amount of ₱1.16 million was received by the College in CY 2008.  



Review of the financial statement and supporting schedule showed loans receivable balance for the SAFE loan program of 116 students amounting to ₱0.92 million as of November 30, 2020. However, the schedule submitted only indicates the name of student-grantees and the amount of their outstanding loan. As shown in the said schedule, the balance representing loans outstanding in the books aged more than one year.



Verification of pertinent records revealed that loans granted to students in CYs 2008 and 2009 remain unpaid as of November 30, 2020, contrary to the repayment period stipulated in the CHED Memorandum of two to five years after graduation. Hereunder is the summary of outstanding SAFE loans:

  Data on the student’s loan was traced in the report as of February 28, 2009 submitted to CHED. However, some were not yet verified because there was no proper turn-over of documents from previous personnel handling the SAFE loan program. According to the accounting personnel currently handling CHED loan programs, they are still in the process of locating documents and reports for verification of the balances.  



	b)	Student Financial Assistance Program (STUFAP)



CHED Memorandum Order No. 4 series of 2004 provided the guidelines for the implementation of the STUFAP. The program caters to financially needy 3rd, 4th and graduating students. The student loan can be used for tuition and other school fees, books and course projects, thesis writing, board and lodging, graduation fees and other valid educational expense. 



Item IV of the same Memorandum provides the duties, functions and responsibilities involved in the implementation and administration of the program. This section enumerates the functions of the participating higher education institution such as entering into loan agreement with borrowers and keeping of separate accounting records of the STUFAP Fund subject to periodic inspectorial visit by CHED finance personnel and/or COA resident auditor, among others.



Further, Item VII states that Qualified borrowers may be allowed to borrow a maximum of ₱8,000.00 per semester xxx.



--	Loans below ₱4,000.00 are payable within five years.

--	Loans above ₱4,001.00 are payable within ten years.

 

Item VI (e) of the Memorandum provided further that applicants for the STUFAP must have a co-borrower either his/her parents, his/her relatives or any person who is a GSIS/SSS member.



The College had received a total amount of ₱416,000 from CHED as one of the participating higher education institutions qualified for the grant of the STUFAP loans. Audit of loans receivable for STUFAP disclosed that ₱93,290 from 15 students has been outstanding as of November 30, 2020.



Further, verification of available records revealed that the balances were from loans released in CYs 2005 to 2010 as summarized below:

Based on records and documents found on file in the Accounting Office, the Audit Team was able to trace the date and amount of grant to the students with existing loan balances as of date. However, as of September 30, 2010, the latest record available, the date and amount of grant for one student with outstanding balance of ₱1,600 could not be verified. Record showed that the said student had availed of the program twice, one on August 4, 2004 and another on July 20, 2006 amounting to ₱8,000 each but were already paid on April 1, 2005 and April 13, 2007, respectively. 



Moreover, in a letter dated December 12, 2007 of the then College Accountant to the Director of the Office of the Student Services, he provided updates regarding the students who had already graduated but with outstanding STUFAP, SELF and SLP accounts. Three students who have availed the STUFAP loans and which are still outstanding as of November 30, 2020 were identified from the list together with the names of the guarantors who are all employees of the CNSC. As stated in the letter, the payroll clerk will be required to start the deduction from the salary of guarantors. It was also mentioned that per information from the Registrar, the credentials of the students were on hold until their accounts are fully paid by their guarantors or by themselves. Had these conditions been actually implemented, loans of these students must have already been paid and beneficiaries of the program should have been expanded.



	c)	Student Loan Fund (SLF)



Report on the monitoring of the implementation of SLF of the College on November 20, 2008 submitted to the Regional Director, CHED Regional Office No. V by the Education Program Specialist (EPS) of CHED disclosed the following conditions and qualifications for the SLF of the College:

IV. Loanable Amount

Qualified students were able to borrow from ₱1,000.00 to ₱7,545.00 used for tuition and other school fees.

V. Mode of Payment and Interest Rate

The school’s repayment schedule is on a short-term basis and varies from four (4) months to one (1) year at six per cent per annum interest.	



Loans Receivable amounting to ₱75,953 as of November 30, 2020 pertains to unpaid loans of students who availed of the Student Loan Fund program of CHED received by the College in CY 2000 amounting to ₱0.50 million. Details of the balance retrieved from available records disclosed the following:

The balance for the SLF, just like the other loan programs of CHED, was not supported with proper documentation to establish correctness of the loan balances. Scrutiny of records revealed that loans of students were guaranteed by employees of the College. 



	d)	Student Emergency Loan Program (SELP)



The Audit Team was not able to secure documents/records relative to the loans granted to students under the SELP which has outstanding balance amounting to ₱91,025 as of November 30, 2020. 



According to the concerned personnel in the Accounting Office, they are still in the process of locating the documents/records relative to the CHED loan programs. She asserted that financial report submitted to CHED every semester was based on available records transferred to her when she was assigned in the Accounting Office. She informed the Audit Team that some documents were already retrieved for updating of records. The Audit Team was also informed that subsidiary records were prepared in the initial years of implementation of the program, however, the same can no longer be located due to change in offices and previous flooding in the College.   



Moreover, inquiry with the Scholarship and Financial Assistance Unit (SFAU) Chairperson revealed that currently, there are no longer subsequent releases to students for loans covered by the above-mentioned programs of CHED. No records were found on file in their office such as the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with CHED, loan agreements, promissory note, and other pertinent records regarding the loan programs. Nevertheless, she said that they have already sought assistance with the Registrar’s Office for the information particularly the addresses of students with outstanding loan balances based on the schedule submitted to their office by the accounting division to facilitate management actions.  



The inability of Management to properly monitor and collect past due loans receivable accounts deprived other students that could have also benefited from the programs. Further, the unavailability of records and documents precluded verification of the correctness and reliability of the balances reflected in the financial statement.



We recommended that Management:

		

a)	Retrieve the pertinent documents supporting the receivables from student’s loans particularly the MOA/loan agreements on various loan grants to ensure the correctness of the recorded balance in the books;



b)	Set up an effective monitoring system to keep track of the whereabouts of the student grantees who have already graduated or are gainfully employed; and



c)	Intensify the collection of due and demandable accounts by issuance of demand letters to student-borrowers and to the co-makers in case of refusal or failure of student-borrowers to settle their liabilities, in order to have adequate funds for relending to financially needy students.



Management Comment:



The College President asserted that he has already directed the concerned offices to retrieve all the pertinent documents. They admitted that they have difficulty of retrieving the documents as the program was way back 2000-2005 and previous typhoons could have damaged these documents. Nonetheless, concerned employees of SFAU-Office of the Student Services and Development (OSSD) and Accounting Office have been exhausting alternative ways to support the receivables which will be used as reference to verify correctness of the recorded balance in the books.



According to the SFAU-OSSD, she has already visited the CHED RO V to request copies of old documents submitted. However, due to change/movement of personnel at CHED, they were able to retrieve only minimal documents. Nonetheless, they have been coordinating with Accounting Office and Registrar’s Office for verification of data and availability of other documents. From then, the list containing the names, addresses and other details of student records will be the key input as regards setting up of an effective monitoring system. She said that they are persistently retrieving students’ addresses in coordination with Registrar’s Office and committed that once the final list is forwarded to Accounting Office, demand letters will immediately be sent.





			7)	Inventory accounts totaling ₱8.73 million were overstated by ₱2.51 million due to non-recording of issuances to end-users as expense. 



International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 12 sets out the accounting treatment for inventories. Paragraph 44 to 46 thereof provides the subsequent recognition of inventories as expense as follows:



Recognition as an expense



44.	When inventories are sold, exchanged, or distributed, the carrying amount of those inventories shall be recognized as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. If there is no related revenue, the expense is recognized when the goods are distributed or the related service is rendered. Xxx



45.	For a service provider, the point when inventories are recognized as expenses normally occurs when services are rendered, or upon billing for chargeable services.



46.	Some inventories maybe allocated to other asset accounts, for example, inventory used as a component of self-constructed property, plant, or equipment.  Inventories allocated to another asset in this way are recognized as an expense during useful life of the asset.



Likewise, Section 7, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that when inventories are sold, exchanged, or distributed, their carrying amount shall be recognized as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. If there is no related revenue, the expense is recognized when the goods are distributed or the related service is rendered.



Review of the SFP as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that balances of various inventory accounts amounted to ₱8.73 million. However, per actual inventory count by the Property Custodian as reported in the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) as of year-end, the same amounted only to ₱6.21 million, thereby, showing an unreconciled difference of ₱2.51 million. Details are presented as follows:

Further examination of the submitted report and inquiry with concerned personnel also revealed the following deficiencies:



--	Items of inventory in the RPCI such as Common Office Supplies, Janitorial Supplies and IT supplies totaling ₱2.38 million were not properly classified in accordance with the Revised Chart of Accounts, thus, difficulty in reconciling the inventory items classified in the books. 



--	Supplies Ledger Cards maintained in the Accounting Office were not updated, hence, quantity of item/s or article/s per card reflected in the RPCI was based on the inventory balance remaining in stock per stock cards.



--	Merchandise inventories in the Business-Related Fund (BRF)-Income Generating Projects of the College amounting to ₱1.43 million was erroneously classified as Other Supplies and Materials Inventory in the RPCI. Some items under the said inventory account disclosed discrepancies between the balance per card and balance per count as follows:

The personnel in charge of the custody of the inventory items averred that the balance per card reported in the RPCI was based on the Income Generating Project (IGP) Office’ records as of June 30, 2020, thus, issuances from July to December were not considered causing the discrepancies. 



According to the personnel in charge in the accounting of the BRF, she has already considered the difference as expense in the books.



It should be noted that the balances per card column in the RPCI should be the quantity of item/s or article/s appearing in the Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs) as provided in Appendix 66 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II.   

The material discrepancy noted was indicative that the concerned Offices did not account properly the receipt and utilization of inventories and were unable to reconcile their records to arrive at reliable and accurate data on the accounted inventories.



The inability to reconcile records with actual count did not present the real figures on inventory and expense accounts for a certain period, thus, affecting the accuracy and reliability of Inventory accounts as presented in the financial statements.



We recommended that Management require the Accountant and the Property/Supply Officer to comply with the following courses of action: 



a)	Trace the discrepancies and effect the necessary adjustments on the affected inventory accounts; 



b)	Check, verify and/or investigate the difference between the balance per card per SLC of the Accounting Office and actual count;



c)	Religiously conduct periodic reconciliation to have reliable inventory account balances on the records of both offices; and



d)	Maintain updated SLCs in the Accounting Office and Stock Cards in the Property and Supply Office to facilitate reconciliation of the inventory report with records.



Management Comment:



The Supply Officer stressed that the overstatement was due to immediate issuance of items to end-users and purchases in which payment was made by the delivery units which her office has no record of issuances made by them while the College Accountant said that the Accountant in-charge have maintained and updated the SLC for BRF. The personnel in-charge of the custody of BRF inventories and preparer of RPCI report were already informed to use the proper account “Merchandise Inventory” on their report for proper classification of garments supplies.



Also, Management informed that there is an on-going tracing of discrepancies as regards inventory accounts between the Accounting Office and Supply and Property Management Office (SPMO). Once finalized, corresponding adjustments in the books shall be made to ensure the accuracy of inventory accounts. 



The Officer in-Charge (OIC) in the Office of the President has immediately directed the Accountant and Property/Supply Officer to investigate the causes of variances between SLC and actual physical count and to make corrective entries on the discovered discrepancies. They were also directed to implement a mechanism of close monitoring of the updating of inventory records and its periodic reconciliation between their offices and to maintain updated supplies ledger cards and stock cards. Further, all designated Supply Officers of different delivery units have been instructed to submit a quarterly report regarding the movement of inventories of their respective delivery unit.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



All issuances of items to end-users must be duly supported with Requisition Issue Slip (RIS) and reported in the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) to be submitted to the Accounting Office for recording in the books.





			8)	The existence, accuracy and reliability of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts valued in the books at ₱607.89 million (excluding Land, Land Improvements and Infrastructure Assets) could not be determined and ascertained due to the following:



a)	Unreconciled variance of ₱30.99 million between the balance in the FS and Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE).



Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides the Accounting and Property Records to be maintained for PPE. The Chief Accountant shall maintain the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain Property Card (PC) for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like Property Acknowledgement receipt (PAR).



Appendix 69, Volume II of the same Manual provides for the instructions in maintaining PC as follows:



D.	The report on the physical count of the PPE shall be reconciled with the PCs every year and any discrepancies should be immediately verified and adjusted.



On the other hand, Appendix 70 also provides for the instructions in maintaining PPELC as follows:



D. The PPELC shall be reconciled with the report on the physical count of the PPE, PC and the control accounts. Any discrepancies shall be immediately verified and adjusted.



Regular reconciliation between accounting and property records allows the monitoring and testing of the operation of controls and helps detect shortages, losses and identify errors in recording. It allows prompt correction and adjustment of errors and pinpoint responsibility and accountability for the property.

	

Verification of records disclosed that the PPE account balance of ₱127.28 million (excluding Land and Land Improvements, Infrastructure Assets, Buildings and Other Structures and Construction in Progress accounts) does not reconcile with the balance per RPCPPE amounting to ₱96.30 million or a difference of ₱30.99 million.

Further examination of records and report revealed the following:



--	Account titles in the RPCPPE were still not compliant with the Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) per COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 replacing the Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2015) of the GAM for NGAs Volume III, despite prior year’s audit observation. Account titles, such as, IT Equipment and Software, Agricultural, Fishery and Forestry Equipment and Medical, Dental and Laboratory Equipment, Other Machinery and Equipment were used in the RPCPPE, hence, had difficulties in comparing the balances reflected in the report and the balances in the financial statement;



--	PPEs amounting to ₱24,800 was not properly classified but reported under Furniture and Fixtures/Other Machinery and Equipment in the RPCPPE; 



--	The RPCPPE was prepared by Campus and not by Fund Cluster;



--	No RPCPPE prepared for Land Improvements-Aqua Culture Structures, Other Land Improvements under the Regular Agency Fund (RAF) and BRF, Office Building under RAF, Hostels and Dormitories and Other Structures valued in the books at ₱9.77 million, ₱1.22 million, ₱29.54 million, ₱15.04 million and ₱100.60 million, respectively; 



--	Various PPEs were still under the name of retired employees reflected in the “Remarks” column of the RPCPPE. According to the Supply Officer, said PPEs were already transferred to other employees but they were not yet able to update the report;



--	Some PPE items were short per count as against the recorded balance per card and/or were not counted/quantified which should have been reflected in the report as shortages;



--	Various PPEs have unknown value; and



--	Motor Vehicles account balance amounting to ₱24.14 million reported in the SFP was not in agreement with the reported balance in the PPELC of ₱24.05 million resulting in a variance amounting to ₱90,000. 

 

The Accounting and Property Units were not able to regularly reconcile their records, so as to determine whether existing assets reconcile with the recorded accountability, and if any discrepancy should be found, proper investigation shall be conducted and correction of records shall be effected, if necessary. Hence, such inability certainly affected the proper accounting and valuation of the assets of the College.



Non-reconciliation between the Accounting and Supply Office records resulted in unreconciled balances of PPE accounts amounting to ₱30.99 million, contrary to the afore-cited rules and regulations, thus, the existence, accuracy and reliability of the reported PPE accounts as of December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained.



b)	Buildings account totaling ₱480.61 million in the Statement of Financial Position was unreliable due to inclusion of the value of three demolished buildings, amounting to ₱2.55 million, out of the 17 demolished buildings and structures from CYs 2018 to 2020, resulting in overstatement of assets by same amount and accumulated depreciation by ₱1.47 million.



Section 39, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, on derecognition of PPE states that the cost of the PPE together with the related accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss shall be removed from the accounts (2014 ed. Financial Accounting, Volume I, Valix). The carrying amount of an item of PPE shall be derecognized on disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected from its use or disposal. 



Verification of the recorded Buildings account with total cost amounting to ₱480.61 million (Office and School Buildings) from the recorded PPEs in the PPELC of the Accounting Office as well as PPEs recorded in the RPCPPE of the Supply and Property Office, as against the list of demolished buildings and other structures of the College submitted by the Institutional Planning and Development Office (IPDO) disclosed three buildings that were already demolished but were still carried in the books as of December 31, 2020.

Review of the submitted List of Demolished Buildings and Other Structures showed that 17 buildings and structures were demolished from CYs 2018 to 2020. However, due to inadequacy of records, we were only able to identify three buildings amounting to ₱2.55 million that were demolished as per submitted request for inspection to COA. Other buildings and structures in the list either do not match the description or the value in the PPELC and Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Properties (IIRUP). 



The reliability of the PPE, accumulated depreciation and book value/carrying amount are doubtful due to omission of Management to derecognize the demolished buildings, thus, resulting in overstatement of the assets by ₱2.55 million and accumulated depreciation by ₱1.47 million.



We recommended that Management take the following courses of action:



a)	Require the Inventory Committee to conduct a thorough review of the RPCPPE by conducting actual count, validation, verification and inspection of PPE owned by the College;



b)	Maintain complete and updated PCs and perform periodic reconciliation to ensure that all discrepancies are immediately investigated, cleared and reconciled with the books of accounts; and



c)	Derecognize the three demolished buildings and coordinate with the concerned office for the determination of other demolished buildings still existing in the books, to correct the overstatement of PPE accounts.





Management Comment:



The OIC in the Office of the President has already instructed the Inventory Committee to review the RPCPPE and immediately directed the Accountant and Property/Supply Officer to designate responsible persons to update inventory records and conduct periodic reconciliation.



The Accounting Office and SPMO was also directed to coordinate with IPDO to reconcile PPELC and RPCPPE with the list of demolished buildings to reflect true valuation of buildings and other infrastructure. They are directed to derecognize the demolished buildings still existing in the books for fair presentation of the respective accounts.



On the other hand, the College Accountant stressed that adjustments were made on the accounts as recommended in previous audit for purchases exceeding ₱15,000 to be classified as PPE. The ₱90,000 difference in the motor vehicle will be verified.  Further, she said that despite her request to be furnished with the list of demolished buildings for recording in the books, they were not provided with the copy of the list, thus, they do not have the basis or attachments to the Journal Entry Voucher (JEV). 



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



Regardless of the adjustments and dropping off items below the ₱15,000 threshold which was also adjusted in the preparation of the RPCPPE by the Supply Officer, reconciliation of the Accounting and Property records should have been made to monitor and detect discrepancies.





			9)	Inclusion of obligations not yet due and demandable amounting to ₱101.74 million and non-recording of its obligation to pay for the completion of project amounting to ₱1.36 million, in the year-end balance of Accounts Payable totaling ₱207.77 million, overstated and understated respectively, the Accounts Payable account at year-end.



a)	Recognition of Accounts Payable for obligations not yet due and demandable amounting to ₱101.74 million.

Likewise, the Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) for NGAs as prescribed in COA Circular 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020, describes Accounts Payable as: 

	

Accounts Payable- This account is credited to recognize receipt of goods or services on account in the normal course of trade and business operation. This account is debited for payment/ settlement of liabilities and/or adjustments.



Review of the Schedule of Accounts Payable and the Aging of Due and Demandable Obligations (Financial Accountability Report (FAR) No. 3) as of December 31, 2020, disclosed that various obligations which were not yet due and demandable totaling ₱101.74 million were recorded as Accounts Payable in the books of the agency. Details are presented hereunder:

As can be gleaned from the above table, various projects which were bid and awarded in CY 2020 and which obligations are not yet due and demandable because said projects were not yet even started and no contract agreement has been consummated as of year-end but such were already recorded in the Statement of Financial Position as Accounts Payable of the College. 



Further verification and inquiry with the concerned personnel revealed that one project of the College, the Completion of Central Business Processing Center in Abaño Campus with a bid amount of ₱18.99 million was not yet awarded to the winning bidder pending the decision of the Head of the Procuring Entity for the motion for reconsideration submitted by one of the bidders. Total bid amount for the said project was also included in the balance of the Accounts Payable account in the financial statements.



According to the personnel in-charge in the recording of accounts in the Accounting Office, accounts payables are recorded in the books based only on the submitted Obligation Request and Status (ORS) forwarded by the Budget Office. No other supporting documents were secured to ensure that cost of goods/services/projects recorded as accounts payable were delivered/rendered/ completed and accepted in accordance with the above-cited provisions.



If goods, services, or projects are not yet delivered, rendered, or completed and accepted at year-end, these should not be recognized as Accounts Payable in the books. Instead, these shall be disclosed as Not Yet Due and Demandable Obligations in the agencies’ quarterly FAR such as FAR 1–Summary of Appropriation, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and Balances (SAAObDB) for Regular Agency Fund and FAR 2 – Summary of Approved Budget, Utilizations, Disbursements and Balances (SABUDB) for off-budgetary funds.



b)	Obligation to pay for completed project amounting to ₱1.36 million was not included in the Accounts Payable account balance.



Review of the SABUDB for Off-Budgetary Funds (FAR 2) disclosed existing due and demandable obligations for capital outlay totaling ₱15.58 million as of December 31, 2020, as shown below:

     *With revised contract amount of ₱1,761,577.23

As presented in the preceding table, three infrastructure projects were reported in the FAR 2 as due and demandable, with one project already completed as of December 2020 amounting to ₱1.36 million, as per Accomplishment Report for Infrastructure Projects submitted by the Institutional Planning and Development Office. However, verification of the balance in the Aging of Due and Demandable Obligations revealed that the amount of ₱1.36 million was not included as Accounts Payable in the financial statement.



Moreover, the remaining balance of the not yet completed/accomplished two projects, namely, Construction of Computer Studies Building and Construction of Food Service and Business Incubation Center are considered not yet due and demandable, hence, must be disclosed in the Notes to Financial Statements and reported in the List of Not Yet Due and Demandable Obligations prescribed under Section 3.5 of COA Accounting Circular Letter No. 2007-002 dated January 19, 2007 which states that:



 3.0 GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES



3.5 The Budget Officer/Head of Budget Unit shall also submit a List of Not Yet Due and Demandable Obligations (Annex E). Such obligations which are not yet recorded as liabilities are agencies’ valid commitments based on approved contracts/purchase orders where projects are not yet implemented and/or goods are not yet delivered. The same shall be disclosed in the Notes to Financial Statements.



The recording of obligations not yet due and demandable amounting to ₱101.74 million and inability to recognize the cost of the completed project amounting to ₱1.36 million in the Accounts Payable balance resulted in the misstatement thereof in the financial statements.



We recommended that Management take the following courses of action:



a)	Stop the practice of recording procured goods/services/projects which were not yet delivered/rendered/completed and accepted as Accounts Payable, regardless of the year when these obligations were incurred, and make the necessary adjusting entries for the inclusion to the Accounts Payable account of the obligation not yet due and demandable amounting to ₱101.74 million;



b)	Verify and secure the necessary documents prior to recording of obligations in the Accounts Payable account in the books of the Agency;



c)	Secure the Certificate of Completion for the Repair of CBPA Building and once established, make the necessary entry for the recognition of accounts payable amounting to ₱1.36 million; and



d)	Strictly adhere to the guidelines provided in the GAM for NGAs in the recognition of accounts payable and COA Accounting Circular Letter No. 2007-002 on the preparation of List of Not Yet Due and Demandable Obligations and disclosure thereof in the Notes to Financial Statements.



Management Comment:



The Officer-in-Charge in the Office of the President averred that she has already called the attention of Accounting Office and Budget Office to stop the practice of recording procured goods/services/projects which were not yet delivered/rendered/completed and accepted as Accounts Payable in the book of the agency. They assured that in the succeeding transactions, proper accounting of the procured projects shall be made in the books.



The Budget Officer was also instructed to verify the details of each transaction if it is substantially recognizable as obligations in the Accounts Payable account in the books of the agency. Relevant documents shall be secured to support such claim.



Also, the IPDO was directed to secure the Certificate of Completion for the Repair of CBPA Buildings and furnish the Budget and Accounting Office to serve as basis for the recognition of Accounts Payable.



Further, the Accountant in-charge explained that the projects were inadvertently not included in the Accounts Payable balance.





			10)	The accuracy and reliability of the Due to NGAs account balance of ₱1.87 million as of September 30, 2020 could not be ascertained due to net variance of ₱464,715 against the confirmed reciprocal account balances of the Source Agencies (SA).



Item 2, Section 111 of PD No. 1445 provides that the highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.



Review of the Due to NGAs account balance totaling ₱1.87 million as of September 30, 2020 showed unliquidated balances of funds transferred to Camarines Norte State College from different National Government Agencies. Details are as follows:

As gleaned from the data, the College received fund transfers from NGAs for implementation of various projects. Verification of records disclosed that the DOST PCAARRD pineapple projects entitled “Enhancing Productivity and Marketability of Queen Pineapple” are composed of six component projects and the balance reflected in the books pertains to the unliquidated balance of funds received for Project 4-Development of Site-specific Sustainable Integrated Pest Management of Queen Pineapple under Different Cropping Schemes in Leyte and Camarines Norte.



To ascertain the accuracy of the recorded balances and conditions for the implementation of the projects funded by NGAs, the Audit Team requested for copies of the MOA and sent confirmation letters to the SAs through registered or electronic mail. However, the Audit Team was not able to receive replies from the DA Central Office, DOST PCAARRD and NCCA. 



As per confirmation letters received, it was observed that the recorded balances of fund transfers from three SAs do not reconcile with the balances presented in the financial statements as of September 30, 2020 submitted by the Accounting Unit resulting in a net variance of ₱464,715 as follows:

The fund received from DA RO V amounting to ₱484,000 intended for the post-harvest related rice research and development projects was directly transferred by the NGA to Labo Campus for the implementation of the project. However, this was not recorded in the books as Due to NGAs by the Campus, thus, the unreconciled balance with the record of the SA. The bookkeeper asserted that she was not fully aware of the said fund transfer and the recording made thereof as she was assigned for the position only in August 2020. 



While for the funds received from NIA for Farmers Satisfaction Survey, the agency has a zero balance in its records; however, the College’s books reflected a balance of ₱7,352 still subject for refund to SA. A Certificate of Completion and Certificate of Acceptance were issued on January 10 and January 12, 2018, respectively. 



Likewise, per certification of the DILG Regional Accountant, there was no outstanding receivable balance from the College recorded in the books as of September 30, 2020 for Citizen Satisfaction Index System Program Fund because submission of liquidation documents was not required in the utilization and disbursements and that the fund transfers were booked under the Budgetary Support to State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) account and closed under the Government Equity account at year-end.



Further verification of pertinent documents and records revealed the following:



--	Copy of the MOA for the DA-ACEF scholarship program was not furnished to the Audit Team, hence, limited the determination of the terms and conditions of the agreement between agencies.



--	Copy of the MOA between the DOST PCAARRD, Visayas State University, DA Regional Office No. V and CNSC for the pineapple projects was not dated and notarized and was not signed by the Regional Executive Director of the DA RO V.



--	Financial assistance from TAPI through the DOST granted in February 2019 was not utilized/implemented because according to the project DAT BED Coordinator, the students who proposed the business plans for Barani and Paruyan rice wine opted not to avail of the grant for reasons of their employment. Nonetheless, she stressed that they already requested for the use of funds for other student beneficiaries who have submitted their business proposals. The request was approved by the DOST on December 2019. However due to the pandemic in CY 2020, the project was delayed. 



--	Disbursements made out of the funds received from various NGAs were directly debited to the Due to NGAs account and prior to the submission of liquidation reports instead of debiting the appropriate expense accounts contrary to Annex M of GAM for NGAs prescribing accounting entries in the books of the Implementing Agencies. The non-recording of the expense accounts may have nil effect on the financial statements of the agency because said accounts will be closed at the end of the year; however, its immediate recording of liquidation prior to the submission of liquidation reports affects the reconciliation process.



The discrepancy of the Due to NGAs account balance against the confirmed reciprocal account balances of the SAs resulted in a net variance of ₱464,715, thus, casting doubt on the accuracy and reliability thereof in the financial statement. 



We recommended that Management require the Accountant to coordinate with the SAs to establish the correct balance of the fund transfers and make the necessary adjustments in the books of accounts, if warranted.



Management Comment:



The College President has immediately directed the College Accountant to coordinate with the SAs to establish the correct balance of the fund transfers and make the necessary adjustments in the books of accounts, if warranted, consistent with COA recommendations.



On the other hand, the College Accountant stressed that her office was not furnished with the liquidation report of the Project-in-charge of the NIA and DILG RO V projects and was not informed of what to do with the remaining balances of the accounts. She said that they will coordinate with the Project-in-charge on what to do with the remaining balances since they are the ones directly involved with the projects. For the project with the DA RO V, liquidation report was already submitted to them. She further averred that they will follow up with the campuses that have DA ACEF Scholarship regarding the implementation of the program.





			11)	Inconsistencies in the quarterly balances reported in the Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs) as well as the recorded balances in the registries maintained by the Budget Office. 



Section 111 (2) of PD No. 1445 provides that “the highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.”



Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, prescribes the guidelines in monitoring, accounting and reporting of the budget in the financial statements. This also prescribes the records to be maintained by the national government agencies, forms to be used and reports to be prepared to effectively monitor the budget as well as the required information disclosure and presentation of budget information in the financial statements in accordance with Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) 24.



Moreover, Section 8(c), Chapter 2, Volume I of the same Manual provides that each entity maintains budget registries which are reconciled with the budget records maintained by the DBM and the Government Accountancy Sector (GAS), COA. 



Review and verification of the submitted BFARs and their respective registries maintained in the Budget Office disclosed inconsistencies in the balances reflected in the reports as follows:



a)	Quarterly balances of the current year disbursements of the Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) of the RAF of the College reported in FAR1-Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and Balances (SAAODB), FAR 1A-Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and Balances by Object of Expenditures (SAAODBOE) and Registry of Allotments, Obligations and Disbursements (RAOD) were as follows:

It should be noted that FAR 1 is just a summary of FAR 1A, hence, total amounts in the FAR1 should tally with the totals in FAR 1A while registries as record of allotments, obligations and disbursements must also equal the amount in the reports. 



b)	Quarterly balances of the utilizations and disbursements of the Internally Generated Fund of the College reported in FAR2-Statement of Approved Budget, Utilizations, Disbursements and Balances (SABUDB) for Off-Budgetary Funds, FAR 2A- Statement of Approved Budget, Utilizations, Disbursements and Balances by Object of Expenditures (SABUDBOE) for Off-Budgetary Funds and Registry of Budget, Utilization and Disbursements (RBUD) were as follows:

Similar to FAR 1, FAR 2 as a summary of FAR 2A must be reconciled to equal the balances in both reports to ensure correctness and reliability of the reports. 

As can be gleaned from the table, while the annual total utilization and disbursements reflected in the reports were equal, variances were noted between the reported quarterly balances of current year disbursements in FAR 1, FAR 1A and RAOD as well as the quarterly utilizations and disbursements in FAR2, FAR2A and RBUD. These variances caused by inconsistencies in the reported balances could mislead the users as to the timing of utilization and actual disbursements and determination of the actual available balances in appropriation/budget in a particular quarter that is also considered in the granting of Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) of the College.



Further, total allotments for Personnel Services (PS), MOOE and Capital Outlay (CO) reported in FARs 1 and 1A did not tally with the total allotments in FAR 1B as follows:

Also, the Budget Office was not able to regularly submit copies of the monthly and quarterly BFARs to COA pursuant to COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2019-1 dated January 1, 2019, precluding the Audit Team’s timely review and verification of the reports.



Inconsistencies in the reported data cast doubt on the accuracy of the entries incorporated in the quarterly reports submitted to the DBM and COA and posted in the DBM Unified Reporting System (URS), and ultimately affects reliance on the information provided in the reports by the intended users. 



We recommended that Management require the Budget Officer and College Accountant to take the following courses of action:



a)	Facilitate reconciliation of records and ensure that information in the reports submitted to DBM and COA GAS and posted in the URS are consistent with the corresponding reports/summaries and records maintained in the Budget Office; and



b)	Regularly submit the required budget and financial accountability reports in accordance with the deadline set under COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2019-1 dated January 1, 2019. 



Management Comment:



The OIC - Office of the President has immediately directed the Budget Office to reconcile the differences of quarterly balances between FARs by Object of Expenditures and FARs by Major Final Output. Budget Office was instructed to cross-check the details and balances of each budgetary reports in the next periods.



For the difference of FARs to Registries, Management justified that the disbursement data in the registry has timing differences with the obligations data. The date indicated in the registry is the obligation date, not disbursement date. There were payments that had actual disbursement on the next quarters. 



While for the difference of FAR1B to FAR 1, the Budget Officer stressed that this was already corrected. She said that they have been encountering concerns with the confirmation of the balances of FAR1B because of the prolonged maintenance of the DBM URS.



The Budget Office has already been instructed to submit the required budget and financial accountability reports in accordance with the deadline set. Likewise, Budget Office shall maintain a monitoring of its submission to COA.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



Proper accomplishment of the registries in accordance with the GAM for NGAs must be complied by Management. All transactions for obligations including adjustments and realignments must be considered in the recording in the registries so as to reflect the dates of actual recording of utilizations and disbursements.    



As for the corrected FAR1B, the Audit Team has not yet received a copy of the revised FARs. 





B)	COMPLIANCE AUDIT



1)	The monthly take home pay of several employees of Camarines Norte State College was lower than the required minimum amount of ₱5,000 caused by allowing payments of loans through salary deduction.



Section 47 of the General Provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 11465 also known as the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year 2020 relative to the provisions on Authorized Deductions provides that:



Deduction from salaries and other benefits accruing to any government employee, chargeable against the appropriations for Personnel Services, may be allowed for the payment of an individual employee’s contributions or obligations due to the following:

	

a)	The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), PhilHealth Philippine Health (PhilHealth), Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), and Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF);

b)	Non-stock savings and loan associations and mutual benefits association duly operating under existing laws and cooperatives which are managed by and/or for the benefit of government employees;

c)	Associations or provident funds organized and managed by government employees for their benefit and welfare;

d)	Government Financial Institutions (GFIs) authorized by law and accredited by appropriate government regulating bodies to engage in lending;

e)	Licensed insurance companies; and

f)	Thrifts banks and rural banks accredited by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP).



Obligations due to the BIR, contributions due to the Philhealth, GSIS and HDMF, and GSIS and HDMF loans shall be satisfied ahead of all other obligations. The remaining obligations due to other entities listed above shall be satisfied in the order in which they were incurred.



In no case shall the foregoing deductions reduce the employee’s monthly net take home pay to an amount lower than Five Thousand Pesos (₱5,000.00)



Further, in the President’s affirmation message of RA No. 11465 dated January 6, 2020, the President placed Items (b) to (f) of Section 47 on Authorized Deductions under conditional implementation and task all government agencies to leverage the accommodation given to financing institutions in order to secure the most favorable terms possible to uphold the rights and protect the interests of all public servants.



Audit of sampled payrolls pertaining to payment of salaries of the College personnel revealed that there were employees with net take home pay, after loan and other payroll deductions, below the minimum of ₱5,000 contrary to the aforementioned provisions. The average net take home pay of these employees ranges from ₱84 to ₱4,975 a month.  



The main reason why such situation had happened was the approval of every loan application received from employee-borrower without taking into consideration the mandatory net take home pay. The preference of credit should be observed strictly and those that cannot be accommodated should be paid directly by the employee.



The receipt of a minimal amount of net take home pay defeated the purpose of maintaining sufficient amount for subsistence among the employees that would eventually affect their work efficiency. This practice, if left unchecked, will expose government workers to be prey of loan sharks.



We recommended that Management:



a)		Instruct the personnel in-charge in the processing/approving loan application to make sure that the net take home pay of each employee-borrower does not fall below the minimum required amount as prescribed under the General Provisions of the GAA; and

	

b)		Require the Payroll in-charge to strictly observe the order of preference of deductions so that the minimum take home pay of employee is not affected.



Management Comment:



The College President has issued Administrative Memorandum No. 009 s. 2021 directing all concerned officials and employees to refrain from approving loans with monthly net take home pay lower than ₱5,000 upon deducting a new loan application and make the necessary internal control measures to make sure that the net take home pay of each employee-borrower does not fall below the minimum required amount. Likewise, all Payroll in-charge in all campuses has been directed to strictly observe the order of preference of deductions so that the minimum take home pay of employees is not affected.





2)	Construction Safety and Health Programs (CSHP) for infrastructure projects were not approved by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).



Under Section 37.2.3(f) of Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (R-IRR) of RA No. 9184, one of the documents that shall form part of the contract is the construction safety and health program approved by the DOLE.



Concomitantly, Article 162, Chapter 2, Title I of Book Four of the Labor Code of the Philippines mandates the Secretary of Labor and Employment to issue orders that will set and enforce mandatory occupational safety and health standards to eliminate or reduce occupational safety and health hazards in all work places and institute new, and update existing, programs to ensure safe and healthful working conditions in all places of employment.



Pursuant thereto, Section 5 of DOLE Department Order No. 13, Series of 1998 provides that “Every construction project shall have a suitable Construction Safety and Health Program, which must be in accordance with these rules, and other orders and issuances issued by the DOLE. Xxx”



Further, Section 6 of the same Department Order provides that all employers must provide personal protective equipment for all employees needing such equipment. All other persons entering the construction site must wear the necessary protective equipment. The equipment cost for the provision of PPE shall be an integral part of the project cost.



Verification of sample transactions for CY 2020 disclosed that contractors of the following infrastructure projects did not comply with the above cited regulations, to wit:

1,167,552.58

     Note: Only those projects with submitted DVs and supporting documents as of writing.



The Audit Team noted that, while a CSHP was made part of the contract in the infrastructure projects of the College, the same was just prepared and signed by the Project Manager/Contractor and was not received and approved by the DOLE.



Moreover, during ocular inspection conducted by the Audit Team, it was noted that construction workers at the different construction sites were not wearing personal protective equipment to protect them from any form of accident which is not in conformance to the afore cited regulation.  



The inability of the contractors to secure DOLE’s approval of the CSHP exposed the College to absence of official standards within which the contractor’s commitment in ensuring the safety of its workers and the public in general while the project is being implemented shall be measured.



We recommended that Management ensure that all approved contracts for projects implemented are supported with a DOLE-approved CSHP pursuant to Section 37.2.3 of the R-IRR of RA No. 9184. Likewise, require the contractors of the different projects to comply with the provisions of DOLE Order No. 13 s. 1998 to ensure safety of the workers in the performance of their job.



Management Comment:



The IPDO admitted that contractors had been submitting CSHP yet to be approved by the DOLE. Nonetheless, IPDO assured that for on-going infra projects and for implementation, all contractors shall be required to submit DOLE approved CSHP. IPDO shall also require the contractors to strictly adhere to DOLE Order No. 13 to ensure safety of workers in workplace.





3)	Copies of contracts together with their supporting documents totaling ₱113.68 million were not submitted for contract review and evaluation within the prescribed period. Likewise, no requests for technical inspection were submitted for completed projects.



COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, restating with amendment COA Circular No. 87-278 and COA Memorandum 2007-027, requires the submission of all contracts together with their supporting documents to the Commission on Audit within five (5) days after the perfection thereof for review and evaluation of the same. 



Item 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-01 dated February 12, 2009 states that contracts “Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by referee or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned. xxx”



Likewise, Item 3.1.2 of said COA Circular enumerates the copies of documents required to be submitted for contract review. For technical review purposes, submission of contracts and their supporting documents shall furthermore be guided by the specific documentary requirements outlined in the attached checklist marked as Annexes “A” to “T” of this circular. 



During the audit it was noted that copies of contracts and their supporting documents were not submitted to the Audit Team within five (5) days after the perfection of the contract for review and evaluation, as shown in the table below:

Moreover, review of the Accomplishment Report for Infrastructure Projects as of December 28, 2020 showed 10 infrastructure projects with an aggregate amount of ₱129.97 million that were already 100 per cent completed. However, Management was unable to submit letter request and its corresponding supporting documents for COA Technical Inspection. Hereunder is the list of completed infrastructure projects for CY 2020 as of December 28, 2020:

Non-compliance with the rules and regulations stated above precluded the timely evaluation of the transactions as to their conformity with applicable laws, determination of physical existence of the projects and compliance with the approved plans and specifications for the project.



We recommended that Management comply with the regulations and furnish the Audit Team with the required copy of contracts along with their supporting documents within the prescribed period for the timely review and evaluation. Likewise, submit requests for inspection of completed projects to the Commission on Audit thru the Audit Team.





Management Comment:



The College President has immediately directed the BAC Secretariat for Infrastructure Projects to adhere to the prescribed period of submission of contract and pertinent documents to the COA. They assure that the COA recommendation will be complied with on the submission of the contract for review and other pertinent supporting documents which shall be within five days from perfection of the contract, not on the date of receipt of the Notice to Proceed by the winning contractor.



The IPDO admitted that those recently completed projects are yet to be requested for inspection by COA. They assured that as soon as the needed documents are completed, requests to COA for inspection of the completed projects shall immediately be forwarded.





4)	The performance security posted by the contractors of various projects expired before the final acceptance thereof.



Section 39.1 of the 2016 R-IRR of RA No. 9184 states that to guarantee the faithful performance by the winning bidder of its obligations under the contract in accordance with the Bidding Documents, it shall post a performance security prior to the signing of contract.



Further, Section 39.4 of the same R-IRR provides that the performance security shall remain valid until issuance by the Procuring Entity of the Certificate of Final Acceptance, that is one (1) year after the final completion date.



Also, Section 39.6 provides that the winning bidder shall cause the extension of the validity of the Performance Security to cover approved contract time extensions.



In our review of the implementation of completed infrastructure projects based on the submitted Accomplishment Report for Infrastructure Projects as of September 30, 2020 and documents submitted for request for contract review, we noted that Management was not able to require the contractor to renew its performance bond after the original bond had expired, before the completion and/or final acceptance of the project, contrary to the above-mentioned law and regulations, as shown on the matrix  below:

The absence of a monitoring mechanism by the BAC with regard to the performance bond coverage of all on-going infrastructure projects, resulted in its inability to monitor and require concerned contractors to submit updated performance securities once expired, thus, exposed Management to risk in the event that the contractor was not able to complete the project, correct defect or comply with its obligations under the bidding documents.



We recommended that Management take the following courses of action:



	a)	Require the concerned contractors to renew/extend its performance bond and furnish the Auditor a copy thereof; and



	b)	Designate personnel to monitor the implementation of infrastructure projects to ensure that the contractors are informed and required to renew their performance securities before its expiration.



Management Comment:



Management informed the Audit Team that they have already directed the IPDO to require all contractors to reissue performance security. IPDO has sent notices to all contractors regarding this concern.



Also, the IPDO Director has designated an IPDO Staff to monitor the validity of performance security issued by contractor. A monitoring tool has been devised to keep track of the validity dates of all performance security prior to final acceptance





5)	Inconsistency of the duration for the project “Completion of Supply Office with Stock Room and Garage (Phase 2)” indicated in the Program of Works (POW), Invitation to Bid (ITB) and Contract Agreement. Also, Disbursement Voucher for the final payment and other related documents remained unsubmitted.



Section 20, Rule VII of the R-IRR of RA No. 9184 provides the following: 



20.1. Prior to the advertisement or the issuance of the Invitation to Bid/Request for Expression of Interest for each procurement undertaken through a competitive bidding, the BAC, through its Secretariat, shall call for a pre-procurement conference. The pre-procurement conference shall be attended by the BAC, the Secretariat, the unit or officials, including consultants hired by the Procuring Entity, who prepared the Bidding Documents and the draft Invitation to Bid/Request for Expression of Interest for each procurement. During this conference, the participants, led by the BAC, shall: 



a) Confirm the description and scope of the contract, the ABC, and contract duration; xxx. 



Review of the College’s request for technical evaluation for the project Completion of Supply Office with Stock Room and Garage (Phase 2) with project cost amounting to ₱20.00 million disclosed inconsistencies of the duration of the project as reflected in the POW, ITB, ITB posted in the Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System (PhilGEPS) and indicated in the contract agreement, as shown below:

180 Calendar Days

180 Calendar Days



In response to our verbal inquiry with the Head of the BAC Secretariat on Infrastructure projects of the College, she explained in a letter dated November 23, 2020 that the inconsistencies in the contract duration of the published ITB in the PhilGEPS and the POW was a typographical error between 140 and 240 but regretfully did not notice the inadvertence. She further averred that during the preparation of the contract, a wrong number of days of 180 calendar days supposedly for other project was mistakenly forwarded to the Office of the President for preparation of the contract. 



Scrutiny of disbursements made in CY 2019 for the 80 per cent accomplishment showed that the project which was originally set to start on June 12, 2019 and target completion date on December 8, 2019 was started on July 15, 2019 due to late pre-construction orientation and target date of completion was adjusted on January 10, 2020 or 180 calendar days. Time extensions were granted, and completion date was further adjusted on April 12, 2020 per submitted Accomplishment Report for Infrastructure Projects as of March 31, 2020. Also, Program Evaluation Review Technique-Critical Path Method (PERT-CPM) and Construction Schedule and S-Curve submitted by the winning contractor reflected project duration of 140 calendar days. 



Moreover, final payment for the said project was already disbursed thru List of Due and Demandable Accounts Payable-Advice to Debit Account (LDDAP-ADA) No. 101101-03-071-2020 dated March 25, 2020 amounting to ₱3.84 million. However, the disbursement voucher and its supporting documents were not yet submitted to COA as of this writing, hence, hindering the Audit Team’s post audit and verification of the actual date of completion and other related information. Notice and minutes of meeting for the conduct of pre-procurement conference were likewise not attached in the submitted documents for contract review and evaluation.



The above noted inconsistencies in the duration of the project could have been avoided had the BAC performed their mandated function of confirming the contract duration during the pre-procurement conference and had those personnel involved in the preparation of documents properly checked the accuracy of data prior to the preparation of the contract.



Inability to check the accuracy of the data caused inconsistency of the duration of the project, thus, propriety and reliability of the documents could not be established.



We recommended that Management instruct the BAC to ensure that all data relating to the procurement of infrastructure projects are thoroughly verified and crossed-check with other documents. Also, require the Accountant and other officials concerned to submit immediately the unsubmitted disbursement voucher and supporting documents to the Audit Team for post audit.



Management Comment:



The College President has immediately directed the BAC Secretariat for infrastructure projects to ensure that details of procurement of infrastructure projects are thoroughly verified and cross-checked with other documents to ensure consistency. They acknowledged the inadvertence on the project duration of the Completion of Supply Office with Stock Room and Garage on several documents. Nonetheless, they commit to ensure that data will be thoroughly reviewed in future procurement activities.



Moreover, they said that some documents such as as-built plans and surety bond were not yet submitted by the contractor. Thus, they directed the IPDO to require the contractor to provide all documents related to the said project immediately.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The release of final payment to contractor without the necessary supporting documents reflected lapses in internal control on disbursements of government funds. Management shall install, implement and monitor sound system of internal control in the disbursement of funds to ensure completeness of documents for determination of the validity of transactions.



   

6)	Deficiencies were noted in the procurement of various goods.



				a)	Inability of the BAC to attach the Invitation and Minutes of Pre-procurement conference for contracts to be bid with above ₱2.00 million Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC).



Section 20 of the R-IRR of RA No. 9184 specifies the rules and the guidelines in relation to the conduct of a pre-procurement conference.



Section 20.1 of the R-IRR of R.A. No. 9184 states that “Prior to the advertisement or the issuance of the Invitation to Bid/Request for Expression of Interest for each procurement undertaken through a competitive bidding, the BAC, through its Secretariat, shall call for a pre-procurement conference. Xxx During this conference, the participants, led by the BAC, shall: xxx c) Determine the readiness of the procurement at hand, including, among other aspects, xxx availability of appropriations and programmed budget for contract. xxx”



During the pre-procurement conference, the BAC and Technical Working Group (TWG) determine the readiness of the Procuring Entity to procure goods and services in terms of the legal, technical and financial requirements of the project as required in the regulation. More specifically, the conduct of pre-procurement conference ensures that the procurement will proceed in accordance with the Project Procurement Management Plan (PPMP) and Annual Procurement Plan (APP), confirms the availability of appropriations and programmed budget for the contract, and reviews all relevant documents in relation to their adherence to the law.



Moreover, Section 20.2 of the R-IRR provides that the holding of a pre-procurement conference may not be required for small procurements, i.e., procurement of goods costing Two Million Pesos (₱2,000,000.00) and below, procurement of infrastructure projects costing Five Million Pesos (₱5,000,000.00) and below, and procurement of consulting services costing One Million Pesos (₱1,000,000.00) and below.



Post-audit of sampled transactions disclosed that the notice to observers and minutes of pre-procurement conference evidencing that there was a deliberation conducted by BAC, TWG and the requesting officials for the procurement of goods with ABC above ₱2.00 million were not among the supporting documents of related disbursement vouchers, hence, precluded the Audit Team to validate if the pre-procurement conference was conducted. Hereunder are the list of procurement projects with ABC above ₱2.00 million:



Nature of Goods/Services

ABC (₱)

Supply and Delivery of Furniture and Fixtures

3,508,737.50

Supply and Delivery of IT Equipment and Software

4,180,050.00

Supply and Delivery of Agricultural Equipment

4,786,000.00

Supply and Delivery of Common Office, Janitorial, and IT Supplies

2,057,769.00

Supply, Delivery and Installation of full color high speed multi-function printer and its consumables



3,446,900.00



During the interview, the BAC Chairperson averred that pre-procurement conferences were conducted as required by the R-IRR. It is to be pointed out, however, that the BAC was unable to attach these supporting documents in the DVs.



The inability of Management to submit the required supporting documents for procurement through public bidding of goods with ABC above ₱2.00 million cast doubt on the legality and propriety of the transactions and precluded the Audit Team to validate if the pre-procurement conference was conducted.



				b)	Print-outs of the PhilGEPS posting of ITB have pending, in-preparation, closed or failed status.  

	

Section 8.1.1 of the R-IRR of RA No. 9184 provides that “to promote transparency and efficiency, information and communications technology shall be utilized in the conduct of procurement procedures. Accordingly, there shall be a single portal that shall serve as the primary source of information on all government procurement. The PhilGEPS shall serve as the primary and definitive source of information on government procurement. Xxx”



Further, Section 21.2 on the advertising and posting of the Invitation to Bid/Request for Expression of Interest states that:



21.2.1. Except as otherwise provided in Section 54.2 of this IRR and for the procurement of common-use goods and supplies, the Invitation to Bid/Request for Expression of Interest shall be: 



xxx



b) Posted continuously in the PhilGEPS website, the website of the Procuring Entity concerned, if available, and the website prescribed by the foreign government/foreign or international financing institution, if applicable, for seven (7) calendar days starting on date of advertisement; xxx



In the post audit of sampled procurement of various goods, the Audit Team have noted the following deficiency in the attached print-out copies of postings in the PhilGEPS of Invitation to Bid shown in detail in Annex A.

As shown from the data, various procurements subjected to re-bidding and negotiated procurement under two failed biddings have pending, closed or failed status of posting of ITB in the PhilGEPS on the first and second biddings per attached copies in the DVs.



While the failure of biddings cannot be directly attributed to the status of ITB posting in the PhilGEPS, the submitted documents cast doubt on the propriety of the procurement activities and the integrity of the results. Further, the objective of the posting/advertisement requirement of ensuring widest dissemination of the Invitation to Bid/Request for Expression of Interest to promote transparency and efficiency in the conduct of procurement procedures may not have been achieved.



	c)	Period for the conduct of re-bidding and negotiated procurement under Two-Failed Biddings modality was not adhered.



Section 35.5 provides that should there occur a second failure of bidding, the Procuring Entity may resort to Negotiated Procurement, as provided for in Section 53.1 of the same IRR. 	



Moreover, Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Circular No. 05-2016 dated December 20, 2016 prescribes the period for the conduct of re-bidding and negotiated procurement under the two failed biddings modality, as shown below:



4.0 Period for the Conduct of Re-bidding and Negotiated Procurement under Two Failed Biddings modality 



4.1 Pursuant to the principle of efficiency in the procurement process espoused by RA 9184 and its 2016 Revised IRR, whether in the conduct of Competitive Bidding or Alternative Methods of Procurement, a period for the conduct of re-bidding and Negotiated Procurement under Two Failed Biddings modality shall be prescribed: 



4.1.1 The BAC shall endeavor to conduct the re-bidding of a procurement project immediately, but it should not exceed fifteen (15) days after the declaration of the first failure of bidding under Section 35 of RA 9184 and its 2016 Revised IRR. The period may be extended up to 30 days upon approval of the Head of the Procuring Entity (HoPE); 



4.1.2 The same periods shall be observed for the conduct of Negotiated Procurement under Two Failed Biddings modality reckoned from the declaration of the second failure of bidding; and



4.1.3 If the procurement cannot be undertaken within such periods, the BAC shall make a report to the HoPE so that the latter can make the appropriate decision to facilitate the procurement or take other proper action.



Post audit of sampled transactions disclosed procurement of the College of various goods subjected to re-bidding and negotiated procurement under two failed biddings. Details of the period conducted for re-bidding and negotiation are presented below.

As can be gleaned from the preceding table, the period for the re-bidding for the supply, delivery and installation of full color high speed multi-function printer and its consumables as well as the CPAU costumes and other materials exceeded the prescribed 15 days after the declaration of the first failure of bidding on August 28, 2019 and January 8, 2020 under BAC Resolution No. 036 s. 2019 and Resolution No. 003 s. 2020, respectively. Likewise, negotiated procurement for the supply and delivery of RFID cards, ribbons also exceeded by 60 days from the declaration of the first bidding, however, the delay from the declaration of second bidding could not be determined due to non-submission of the BAC Resolution declaring failure for the second time while delay for the conduct of negotiated procurement under two failed biddings for the supply and delivery of gym equipment exceeded the prescribed period by 156 days.



It is well noted that the R-IRR provisions of RA No. 9184 are in line with the commitment of the Government of the Philippines to promote good governance and its effort to adhere to the principles of transparency, accountability, equity, efficiency, and economy in its procurement process. Relatedly, the prescribed period for the conduct of re-bidding and negotiated procurement under two failed biddings modality were anchored on the same principles. 



In effect, the non-adherence to these guidelines, particularly in the prescribed period casted doubt in Management’s adherence to principles of efficiency in its procurement process.





In view of the foregoing, we recommended the following:



a)	Require the BAC to observe Section 20 of the IRR of RA No. 9184 and justify their inability to conduct the pre-procurement conference for the procurement of goods with an Approved Budget for the Contract of more than ₱2.00 million; 



b)	Implement a strict and comprehensive controls for the proper documentation of the disbursement; 



c)	In all procurement related activities, strictly comply with the provisions of RA No. 9184 and the R-IRR; and



d)	Require the BAC to adhere to the prescribed period for the conduct of re-bidding and negotiated procurement under two failed biddings modality.



Management Comment:



The BAC informed that they conducted pre-procurement conferences for ABC of ₱2.00 million and above. However, they recognized the inadvertence of attaching the minutes of meeting in the supporting documents to COA. The BAC Secretariat assured that the minutes of meeting relative to these procurements shall immediately be forwarded to COA. 



Also, the BAC was immediately directed in coordination with the Accounting Office to prepare a checklist of documentary requirements to ensure proper documentation of procurement activities. Accounting Office was instructed to conduct thorough review of supporting documents and provide immediate feedback to BAC to ensure that deficiencies noted will immediately be complied with.



For the printouts of the PhilGEPS posting of ITB which have pending, in-preparation, closed or failed status, the BAC Secretariat admitted the inadvertence of not printing the notices with remarks of active status because upon posting, they immediately printed the same and did not wait for activation which happened on the next day. Though they humbly averred that winning bidder will not be awarded if posting was not activated.



The BAC asserted that the delay in the conduct of some re-biddings and negotiated procurements under two failed biddings modality was due to the transition period that the BAC for Goods and Services was newly created. Nevertheless, the BAC has already been directed to strictly observe the prescribed period for the conduct of re-bidding and negotiated procurement under Two-failed Biddings modality to ensure the efficiency in procurement process.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Audit Team was not able to properly validate the subject procurement of various goods in the submitted minutes of pre-procurement conference due to lack of specific details such as the ABC of the items/goods to be procured.

7)	Several infrastructure projects with total contract cost of ₱103.73 million awarded to same contractor showed overlapping of contract implementation.



Section 23.6, Rule VIII of the 2016 of R-IRR of RA No. 9184 provides:



Notwithstanding the eligibility of a bidder, the Procuring Entity concerned reserves the right to review the qualifications of the bidder at any stage of the procurement process if the Procuring Entity has reasonable grounds to believe that a misrepresentation has been made by the said bidder, or that there has been a change in the bidder's capability to undertake the project from the time it submitted its eligibility requirements. Should such review uncover any misrepresentation made in the eligibility requirements, statements or documents, or any changes in the situation of the bidder which will affect the capability of the bidder to undertake the project so that it fails the eligibility criteria, the Procuring Entity shall consider the said bidder as ineligible and shall disqualify it from obtaining an award or contract, in accordance with Rules XXI, XXII, and XXIII of this IRR.



Section 34.3, Rule X of the same IRR also provides:



The post-qualification shall verify, validate, and ascertain all statements made and documents submitted by the bidder with the Lowest Calculated Bid/Highest Rated Bid, using non-discretionary criteria, as stated in the Bidding Documents.  These criteria shall consider, but shall not be limited to, the following:



xxx



		a)		Technical Requirements. To determine compliance of the goods, infrastructure projects, or consulting services offered with the requirements specified in the Bidding Documents, including, where applicable:



			i)		Verification and validation of the bidder's stated competence and experience, and the competence and expertise of the bidder's key personnel to be assigned to the project, for the procurement of Infrastructure Projects and Consulting Services;



			ii)		Verification of availability and commitment, and/or inspection and testing for the required capacities and operating conditions, of equipment units to be owned/leased/under purchase by the bidder for use in the contract under bidding, xxx

*Revised Target Date of Completion due to Time Extensions



Gleaned from the preceding table, the Audit Team noted that one contractor (Contractor B) was awarded several projects in the College with coinciding period of implementation. This same contractor entered into a joint venture agreement with another contractor and was awarded with two projects in which the contract implementation period also overlaps (Contractor A).



Moreover, the project Rehabilitation of Social Hall to Central Business Processing Center was already delayed despite consideration for time extensions due to the implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) in the province and unfavorable weather condition as reflected in the Accomplishment Report for Infrastructure Projects as of December 28, 2020. Same contractor was awarded new contracts for two projects in the College despite incurrence of delay in previous projects awarded. 



Examination and verification of the submitted bidding documents of the contractors, also disclosed the following information as shown on the table next page.

Scrutiny of the documents and analysis of the attached sales invoices, official receipts, deed of sale and lease agreements revealed that the contractor’s available equipment, whether owned or leased, were limited to implement the awarded projects and the List of Equipment, Owned or Leased and/or under Purchase Agreements, pledged to the proposed contracts were almost the same for all the projects awarded.



Also noteworthy is that CNSC CANR/Labo Campus is approximately 48.45 km away from CNSC Entienza Campus in Sta. Elena, Camarines Norte while CNSC Abano Campus in Daet is approximately 14.23 km from Labo Campus, hence, could cause delay in the implementation of projects considering the limited equipment and the distance of the location of the projects.



Further, the list of contractor's personnel (e.g. Project Manager, Project Engineers, Materials Engineers, Safety Engineers, Foreman and Skilled workers) proposed to be assigned to the contract also showed that almost the same personnel were assigned to all projects awarded to them.



As prescribed in the aforementioned regulation, verification of the availability and commitment, and/or inspection and testing for the required capacities and operating conditions, of equipment units to be owned/leased is an important procedure in the post-qualification process. The agency should take emphasis on these standard procedures so as not to incur similar issues upon awarding of contracts to prospective bidders. 



The above situations are indicative that the process of post qualifying of contractors of the five infrastructure projects were not strictly done in accordance with Section 34.3(b)(i)(ii), Rule X of the 2016 IRR of RA No. 9184.



Had the post qualification of the contractors been done carefully in accordance with the regulation, the BAC particularly the TWG could have noticed that the contractors' personnel to be assigned and equipment to be utilized were almost the same for all the projects awarded to them. The lack of personnel to supervise the simultaneous implementation of the projects and the insufficiency of the contractors' equipment could result in delayed completion of projects within the specified period of time, depriving the agency of the benefits from using the same at the earliest time. 



We recommended that Management comply the following:



a)	Require the contractors to augment their manpower and/or equipment to be utilized in the projects awarded to them which have the same or overlapping period of implementation to expedite the completion thereof; and



b)	Henceforth, direct the BAC and its TWG to carefully examine the contractor’s manpower and equipment on all the projects to be awarded and not on individual project only in case the contractor is the lowest bidder in several projects which have the same or overlapping period of implementation.



Management Comment:



The College President has issued an administrative memorandum to the BAC and its TWG directing them to carefully examine the contractor’s manpower and equipment on all the projects to be awarded and not on individual project only in case the contractor is the lowest bidder in several projects which have the same or overlapping period of implementation. The IPDO has also recognized the lapses in the post qualification of the equipment to be utilized and manpower requirement. They will be requiring the concerned contractors to augment their manpower and equipment to be utilized in the projects awarded to satisfactorily complete the project on time and strictly monitor ongoing projects to ensure that standards and specifications as prescribed in the contract are strictly complied.









8)		Prior year’s expenses totaling ₱5.18 million that were not booked up as Accounts Payable during that year were improperly charged against the current year’s appropriations. 

	

	Section 119 of PD No. 1445 states that:

	

Accounting for obligations and expenditures. All lawful expenditures and obligations incurred during the year shall be taken up in the accounts of that year.



Likewise, Section 6, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I requires that each entity shall recognize and present its financial transactions and operations using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards. Accrual basis means a basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid.



The accounting policy on recognition of liability is provided in the following regulations:



a)	Sec. 4(s) of Chapter 2, New Government Accounting System (NGAS), Volume I, quoted as follows:



s. Recognition of Liability.  Liability shall be recognized at the time goods and services are accepted or rendered and supplier/creditor bills are received. 



b)	Sec. 2, Chapter 6 of GAM, Volume I, which defined Accounts Payable as follows:



a. Accounts Payable – refers to valid and legal obligations of NGAs/OUs, for which, goods/services/projects have been delivered/rendered/completed and accepted, regardless of the year when these obligations were incurred.



Moreover, Section 25 of CHED Memorandum Order No. 20 s. 2011 provides that expenditures which have been obligated in the current year but to be paid or settled in the next calendar year shall be funded out of remaining fund balance as of December 31. It shall be included as among those to be deducted from Fund Balance at the End of the Year in determining the Accumulated Savings subject of appropriation.



Audit of sampled transactions revealed that various expenses or obligations incurred for CY 2019 totaling ₱5.18 million were charged against CY 2020 appropriations for Internally Generated Fund. Details are presented in Annex B.



As shown in the said Annex, the transactions pertained to services rendered or goods delivered and claims for partially implemented infrastructure projects during the preceding year. However, the College was not able to pay these obligations and the Accounting Office did not book up said expenses as Accounts Payable in CY 2019. These transactions were obligated only in CY 2020 and recorded as current year’s expenses. 



The non-recognition of expenses at the time these were incurred is contrary to the accrual basis of accounting and affects the fair presentation of the financial statements. At this instance, expenses and accounts payable were both understated for the prior years while current year’s expenses were overstated. Accordingly, the budget or appropriations of the affected accounts for CY 2020 were also depleted by the same amount. 



Furthermore, the abovementioned transactions which were charged to current year’s appropriations were in violation of Section 119 of PD No.1445, hence, shall be subject to disallowance, if warranted.



We recommended that Management take the following courses of action:



	a)	Direct the Budget Officer to enforce the compliance of the deadline of submission of valid claims by officials and employees before year-end to ensure that transactions and events are obligated within the period to which they relate/incurred to avoid the improper use of the current year’s appropriations for un-booked prior year’s obligations pursuant to Section 119 of PD No. 1445; 



	b)	Direct the Accounting Office to comply with the accrual basis of accounting by ensuring that all due and demandable obligations of the College, duly obligated during the year that they are incurred by the Budget Office, are accounted for as Accounts Payable in the books; and



	c)	Ensure that transactions are properly supported with complete documentation before payment of claims to avoid suspension thereof in audit.



Management Comment:



The Budget Officer explained that there were available appropriations for the said expenses considering that charging was made from the Internally Generated Fund of the College with budget duly approved by the Board of Trustees and which any unobligated balance of appropriations thereof is just forwarded and still available in the ensuing year’s appropriations. She added that documents were received by her office only in January 2020, thus, claims were obligated only upon receipt of the necessary documents.



On the other hand, the Accountant in-charge averred that no accounts payable were recognized for the transactions since there are no disbursement vouchers prepared yet from the respective requesting offices. The Accounting Office did not have any basis of the amount, payee, particulars for recording in the books.

Nonetheless, they promised that they will enforce stricter compliance to the deadline of submission of all vouchers of valid claims to ensure that all obligations are properly booked.



The Accounting Office was also directed to strategize on how to collect all vouchers of valid claims from all offices before year-end.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:

The Audit Team maintains its original stand on the audit observations even if the funds involved are sourced from Internally Generated Fund because they are also subject to budgeting, thus, the accrual basis of accounting as well as Section 119 of P.D. No. 1445 are still applicable thereof.





9)	Corona Virus Disease (COVID) 19 hazard pay amounting to ₱0.54 million was granted to employees of the College during the period of declared General Community Quarantine (GCQ) and Modified General Community Quarantine (MGCQ), contrary to AO No. 26 and DBM BC No. 1. 



Section 2(b) of Administrative Order (AO) No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 and Section 4.3 of DBM Budget Circular No. 1 dated March 24, 2020 states that the heads of government agencies may grant the COVID-19 Hazard Pay to their personnel/workers without the need for further approval by the DBM provided the personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official working hours by the head of agency/office during the period of implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) measures in the area of such office or work station.(underscoring ours).



On March 16, 2020, the President issued Proclamation No. 929 declaring a state of calamity throughout the Philippines due to corona virus disease 2019 and imposing an ECQ throughout Luzon beginning March 17 until April 13, 2020. The imposition of ECQ was then extended by the President on April 30, 2020. Further, on April 30, 2020, Executive Order No. 112 was issued imposing ECQ in high-risk geographic areas of the Philippines and a GCQ in the rest of the country from May 1 to 15, 2020 wherein areas under ECQ were specifically identified, the province of Camarines Norte was not included but was classified under the GCQ and was already declared under MGCQ from May 16 to May 31, 2020.



Verification of documents relative to the payment of COVID 19 hazard pay of the College disclosed that employees whether permanent, casual and job orders from all campuses were granted hazard pay amounting to ₱500 per day for those who physically reported for work during the implementation of the ECQ in the province on March 17 to April 30, 2020. However, further examination revealed that even after the lifting of the ECQ in the province and imposition of a less strict GCQ on May 1 to 15, 2020 and MGCQ on May 16 to 31 and June 2020, the College still allowed the grant of hazard pay to its employees but only for a rate of ₱100 per day factoring-in the limited budget of the College as indicated in Administrative Order No. 02 s. 2020 dated May 11, 2020. Hereunder is the summary of the grant of hazard pay for the period under GCQ and MGCQ based on available reports and documents submitted:

         541,100.00 

   

Also, as shown on the table presented, there were grants of hazard pay charged to the IGF and BRF of the College contrary to the provisions on the funding source for the grant in accordance with AO No. 26 and DBM BC No. 1 which provides that the amount required for personnel occupying regular, contractual or casual positions shall be charged against their available released PS allotments, while the amount required for Contract of Service (COS) or Job Order (JO) workers shall be charged against their available released MOOE allotments, without need for prior authority from the DBM, provided that all authorized mandatory expenses shall have been paid first. Should an NGA or SUC have insufficient PS or MOOE allotments, as the case may be, to fully cover the COVID-19 Hazard Pay at the rate of ₱500/day per person, a lower but uniform rate may be granted for all qualified personnel.



The grant of hazard pays for employees even after the lifting of the ECQ and implementation of GCQ and MGCQ in the province and charging the amount of ₱31,200.00 from the IGF and BRF were not in pursuance to the above cited rules and regulations, thus, constitutes irregular disbursement of funds as defined under COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, quoted as follows:



“Irregular Expenditures signifies an expenditure incurred without adhering to established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have gained recognition in laws. Irregular expenditures are incurred if funds are disbursed without conforming with prescribed usages and rules of discipline. There is no observance of an established pattern, course, mode of action, behavior, or conduct in the incurrence of an irregular expenditure. A transaction conducted in a manner that deviates or departs from, or which does not comply with standards set is deemed irregular. A transaction which fails to follow or violates appropriate rules of procedure is, likewise, irregular.”



We recommended that Management strictly adhere with pertinent issuances relative to COVID 19 particularly on the grant of hazard pay. It is also recommended to submit the office order/approved authority of employees assigned to report as Skeleton Work Force (SWF) during the period May to June 2020 as well as the MOA identifying CNSC campuses as Community Isolation Units (CIUs) for the said period.



Management Comment:



Management averred that CNSC had served as CIUs supported with a MOA, during the lockdown period until June 2020, and even until now at Labo Campus. On that period CNSC was categorized as high-risk area. Despite this, CNSC SWF, knowing the high risk that they had to face, performed their duties and functions anchored on their pledge of commitment to serve the public even in the midst of high risk not only with their lives but with their families as they served as frontlines, processing, support and administrative functions.



They further stressed that CSC as constitutionally mandated to promote values of morale, responsiveness and progressiveness in the Civil Service anchored the wisdom of the issuance by the Office of the President of Administrative Memorandum No. 26, s. 2020 to at least compensate the danger that our SWF had been facing on that time (May to June 2020). It was the period when government employees’ psyche, after lifting the ECQ, were still adamant whether they had to physically report for work on the danger that they could be infected of the contagious and killing Nobel Corona Virus that shocked the whole world. Likewise, the grant of hazard pay is consistent with Bayanihan to Heal as One (I and II) supporting SWF who sacrificed, in the best that they can do, so that government operation will not be paralyzed to ensure delivery of public services. 



On the charging to IGF and BRF of some of the amounts, the Budget Office cited that employees who have been granted with hazard pay were employees of the respective colleges (Income fund which is the IGF) and employees of the Production (IGP which is the BRF), thus, charging was appropriate.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



We reiterate our recommendation requiring submission of the necessary supporting documents such as the MOA and other related documents identifying the College and its campuses as CIUs together with the office order specifically indicating the names of employees who were required to report as SWF during the period May to June 2020 for further evaluation.





C)	COMPLIANCE WITH TAX LAWS



Taxes withheld from employees, contractors and suppliers for CY 2020 were regularly remitted to the account of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) in compliance with BIR Revenue Regulation No. 2-98 as amended by BIR Revenue Regulation No. 11-2018 and Section 6(a) of PD No. 1445. See Annex C for the Schedule of Remittances to BIR.





D)	COMPLIANCE WITH RA NO. 8291



The Camarines Norte State College regularly remits to the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) the premiums deducted from the salaries of the Officials and Employees in accordance with the provisions of RA No. 8291. See Annex D for the Schedule of Remittances to GSIS.





E)	COMPLIANCE WITH RA NO. 9679



Pag-IBIG Fund premiums and loan repayments of Officials and Employees were deducted from their salaries regularly. Amounts withheld were remitted to the Pag-IBIG Fund in accordance with the provisions of Section 3, Rule VII of the IRR of RA No. 9679. See Annex E for the Schedule of Remittances to Pag-IBIG Fund.





F)	COMPLIANCE WITH RA NO. 7875



PhilHealth premiums of Officials and Employees were deducted from their salaries regularly. Amounts withheld were remitted to PhilHealth in accordance with the provisions of Section 11 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 7875. See Annex F for the Schedule of Remittances to PhilHealth.
