OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
 

A. Financial and Compliance Audit 
 

1. Expenses aggregating P25,900,942.54 were not recorded in their proper accounts 
as prescribed in the Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2015), Volume III of 

the Government Accounting Manual (GAM).  The misclassification provided 

erroneous information in the Statement of Financial Performance on the true 

expenses incurred for the year.  

 

Review of the accounting records and disbursement Vouchers (DVs) revealed 

that certain expenses were recorded without regard for the propriety of the account 

used such that recording is done based on budget allocations rather than on the nature 

of the transactions.  These misclassified expenses were as follows: 

 

a. Various expenses debited to Training Expense and Survey Expense 
amounted to P1,019,409.56 and P1,407,395.61, respectively 

 

The Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2015) prescribes the use of the 

Training Expenses account “to recognize the costs incurred for the 

participation/attendance in and conduct of trainings, conventions and 

seminars/workshops” including training fees, honoraria of lecturers, cost of handouts, 

supplies, materials, meals, snacks and all other training related expenses. The Survey, 

Research, Exploration and Development Expenses account, on the other hand, shall 

be used to record “the cost incurred in the conduct of cadastral, structural, topographical, 
statistical and other type of surveys xxx.” 

 

Our audit revealed that expenses unrelated to training and survey activities 

were charged to the said accounts, as shown below:

Total 1,019,409.56 1,407,395.61

b. Purchases of meals, hygiene kits, isolation tents and Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPEs) totaling P23,474,137.37 representing donations in kind 

to hospitals, civic groups and various Treatment and Rehabilitation Centers 

(TRCs) were recorded under the Training Expense and Advertising Expense 

accounts. 

 

The Advertising Expense account, as provided in the same Revised Chart of 

Accounts of the GAM, is used to recognize “the costs incurred for advertisement, 
such as expenses to: (a) promote and market products and services; and (b) publish 

invitations to bid and other authorized government advertisements.”   
 

The Donations account is used to recognize the amount of donations to other levels 

of government and individuals and institutions.  Section 33.d Chapter 2 of Volume I, 

GAM, defines gifts and donations as consisting of” voluntary transfers of assets 

including cash or other monetary assets, goods in-kind and services in-kind that 

one agency makes to another, normally free from stipulations. (PPSAS 23)” 
 

At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and at the behest of the 

Department of Health (DOH), the Agency extended assistance to certain TRCs, 

determined on an as-need basis, by providing isolation tents for use of patients 

undergoing treatment/rehabilitation who may be stricken with COVID-19 virus. 

These were in the nature of donations but were charged to the Advertising 

Expense account in the amount of P17,533,000.00. 

 

Likewise, the Agency, on various dates donated to certain hospitals and the 

Red Cross meals, hygiene kits (face masks, alcohol, and face shield), and PPEs.  

These donated goods were recorded as Training Expense in the total amount of 

P5,941,137.37. 

 

We noted that the recording of the transactions only followed the budgetary 

expense item charged in the Obligation Request Status (ORS), which were the 

Training, Survey and Advertising Expenses and this was so confirmed by the 

Accounting Division personnel.  

 

Further, due to the pandemic prevailing in CY 2020, trainings and survey 

activities were suspended, thus, the allotments therefor were utilized to the more 

pressing concerns of extending support to those beneficiaries previously mentioned.  

However, Management could have averted the error if its budget was revised 

consistent with the above-cited Section 70.   

 

We recommended and Management agreed that: 

 

a. The Acting Chief Accountant ensure that disbursements are recorded with 
due regard to the actual nature of the transaction and use as guide for the 

description provided for each account in the Revised Chart of Accounts of 

the GAM, Volume III rather than on the basis of the ORS; and 

 



31  

b. Management, in the future, oversee the necessary revision of its budget, 
within the limits set forth under Section 70 of the General Provision of the 

GAA, before it even spends for new programs, projects and activities. 

 
 

Lack of supporting documents for donations in-kind made as a COVID19 response  

 
2. The purchases of donated foodstuff and medical supplies/materials to various 

beneficiaries totaling P4.267 million could not be fully accounted for reasons 

that:  1) the exact quantity per item of donated supplies/materials were not 

indicated in the receiving documents of the recipient-organizations;                        

2) recipients were not properly identified as to their official station and 

position/designation; and 3) some donated goods were not supported with 

acknowledgment receipts, which deficiencies are inconsistent with the 

provisions of COA Circulars 2020-009 and 2014-002. 

 

COA Circular No. 2020-009 was issued to provide, among others, that “there 

is a need to temporarily relax the application of certain provisions xxx in so far as 

receipt, recording, distribution, reporting and direct release of donation in-kind and 

relief goods to the beneficiaries are concerned during this period, without necessarily 

disregarding basic controls to ensure that the donations are properly accounted for.” 

(Underscoring ours) 

 

Section II thereof states the following: 

 

II. GUIDELINES 

 

 1.  COA Circular No. 2014-002 

 

The implementation of the provisions under Item IV – C, Accounting 

Guidelines: In-kind Donations from Local and Foreign Sources; and 

Item V-A and B, Reporting Guidelines: DRRMF sourced from GAA 

and Cash Donations and In-kind Donations is relaxed as follows: 

 

a) Donations in-kind from local and foreign sources 
 

       Xxx 

 

2.  To ensure that the aids and donations received by the recipient 

agencies during the quarantine are properly accounted for, the 

recipient agencies shall be required to submit a Summary/List 

of Donations Received, Distributed and Balances xxx 

categorized (i.e. food, medical supplies, medicines, etc…) and 

can be submitted xxx, if the quarantine exceeds three (3) 

months, within ten (10) working days after the end of each 

quarter, supported with: (1)   acknowledgement receipts of the 



32  

donation in-kind; 

 

                                xxxx 
 

 All other provisions of COA Circular No. 2014-002 and COA Memorandum 

No 2014-009 which are necessary controls to ensure that all donations, be it in cash 

or in-kind, are accounted for shall remain in effect.” (Underscoring ours) 

 

Also, the Instructions on the use of the Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR) 

or Appendix 62 found in Volume II of GAM provide the following rules:  
 

A.   The IAR is a report submitted by the Inspection Officer/Committee and the 

Supply and/or Property Custodian on the inspection and acceptance, 

respectively, of the purchased supplies/goods/equipment/property. 

     

         xxxx 

 

C.  The Inspection Officer/Committee shall sign, specify the date of inspection, 

and put a check “” mark the “Inspection” portion of the IAR, indicating that 

he/she has inspected, verified and found in order the items delivered as to 

quantity and specifications. 

 

D.  The Supply and/or Property Custodian shall acknowledge receipt of the items 

by indicating in the “Acceptance” portion of the IAR, his/her name, signature, 

date of acceptance, and a check “” mark whether the delivery is complete 

or partial as to quantity (specify quantity received, if partial).  

 

E.  The IAR shall be prepared in four (4) copies distributed as follows: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

From March to July 2020, the agency spent a total of P8,311,200.60 for various 

activities in response to the national emergency caused by the spread of the COVID-

19 virus. Of this amount, P6,952,611.37 pertained to donations of food and various 

medical supplies/ materials to public hospitals, the Philippine Red Cross (as per 

request) and DDB’s Drug Abuse Treatment and Rehabilitation Centers (DATRCs) 

nationwide while P1,285,389.23 were spent in housing and meals assistance to its 

skeleton workforce and duty allowance to volunteer-employees who served at testing 

centers during the quarantine period. 
 

We found, however, that P4,267,100.00 of these purchases for COVID19-

response activities could not be properly accounted for because the exact quantity 

per item of donated supplies/materials were not indicated in the receiving documents 

of the recipient-organizations; the recipients were not properly identified as to their 

Original – Supplier (to be attached to the DV) 

Copy 2  – Accounting Division/Unit (to be attached to  

the JEV setting up payables) 

Copy 3 – Inspection Officer/Committee 

Copy 4 – Supply and/or Property Division/Unit’s file

official station and position/designation; and some donations in-kind were not 

supported with acknowledgment receipts. The breakdown of these donated goods 

with the noted deficiencies is shown below. 
 

Nature of donations Amount (P) Deficiencies 

Packed meals for the following  

periods: 

   April  7-15 - 179,000.00  

   Apr. 20-27 - 119,000.00 

   June 8-11   -   56,350.00*

PPE Coverall paid on: 

   4/6/2020  - 1,982,400.00 

  7/28/2020 - 1,500,000.00

360,000.00 

No acknowledgment receipt 

attached 

       Total 4,267,100.00  

 

Validation of the number of quantities per item of donated 

goods/supplies/materials cannot be done since the disbursement vouchers were not 

supported with the suppliers’ Sales Invoices or Delivery Receipts containing the 

details of the delivered goods and the Inspection and Acceptance Receipt (IAR) 

accomplished by management’s Property Custodian upon the receipt of the deliveries 

were also not found among the supporting documents.   
 

We recommended that Management submit the acknowledgment receipts 

for the above goods/supplies/materials duly signed by representatives of the 

donee-agencies/ institutions with their official stations and position/designation 

as well as the respective IARs per delivered purchases relative to its COVID-19 

response activities.    

 
Management Comment: 

 

Management stated that while the quantities in the certifications of receipts of 

donated goods/supplies/materials were not indicated therein, these were properly 

accounted for from their end and a copy of the consolidated report thereon was 

inadvertently omitted among the supporting documents of the disbursement 

vouchers.  The same is true for the IAR, these were duly accomplished and will be 

forwarded to the Team as soon as possible.  Management begged the indulgence of 

the Team to grant an extension of time within which to submit such documents as its 

entire staff of the Administration and Financial Management Division had gone on 

self-quarantine following the contamination of their office’s premises thus, retrieval 

of pertinent documents to address the reported deficiencies in the Audit Observation 

Memorandum was not feasible.

Summary of Non-Moving or Dormant Accounts 

 

3. The DDB had in its books of accounts non-moving or dormant accounts for five years 
and above which pertained to fund transfers for various drug rehabilitation 

activities/projects amounting to P2,317,866.29 as at December 31, 2020 recorded 

under the Due from NGAs, Due from LGUs, Due from GOCCs . The documents 

relative to these dormant fund transfers could not be traced to the records files, hence, 

Management’s action for possible request for write-off could not be initiated.
