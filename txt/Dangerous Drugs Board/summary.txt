EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

A. Introduction 
 

The Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) was established on November 14, 1972 

by virtue of Republic Act (RA) No. 6425 dated March 30, 1972. At the turn of the 

millennium, the rising criminality linked to a heightened national drug problem 

spurred the State to strengthen the drug law enforcement system, thus the 

Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 was crafted under RA No. 9165, 

repealing RA No. 6425 when it took effect on July 4, 2002. 

 

The DDB is managed by a 17-member Board consisting of three qualified 

permanent members appointed by the President of the Philippines; two regular 

members, namely, the incumbent president of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines 

(IBP) and a president/chairman of a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) 

dealing in dangerous drug campaign to be appointed by the President; and twelve 

member-agencies so designated under RA No. 9165 serving in an ex-officio 

capacity. The Chairman of the DDB Board, chosen by the President from among 

the permanent members, sits for a fixed tenure of six years, and the other two each 

serves the Board for two years. 

 

As a policy-making and strategy-formulating body on drug abuse prevention 

and control, DDB is tasked under the law to develop and adopt comprehensive, 

integrated, unified and balanced national drug abuse prevention and control 

strategy and to provide effective mechanisms through sustainable programs on the 

treatment and rehabilitation of fallen victims of drug abuse and/or dependence. In 

line with this, the DDB formulated the Philippine Anti-Illegal Drugs Strategy 

(PADS) which was institutionalized under Executive Order (EO) No. 66 dated 

October 29, 2018. 

 

The organizational set-up of DDB includes four divisions that carry out 

DDB’s numerous functions, namely: Administrative and Financial Management 

Division (AFMD); Legal Affairs Division (LAD); Preventive Education, Training 

and Information Division (PETID); and Policy Studies, Research and Statistics 

Division (PSRSD). 

 

As of December 31, 2020, DDB has a total workforce of 129, broken down 

as follows: 

 
Regular/Permanent 89 

Presidential Appointee 6 

Co-Terminus 6

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial transactions of DDB for CY 2020. It was 

conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the 

Management’s assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the propriety 

of transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and 

regulations; c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and d) determine 

the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations. Moreover, 

the audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards of Supreme 

Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). 

 
E. Auditor’s Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of 

the financial statements of DDB as at December 31, 2020. 
 

F. Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the significant audit observations and the corresponding 

recommendations: 

 

1. Expenses aggregating P25,900,942.54 were not recorded in their proper 
accounts as prescribed in the Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2015), 

Volume III of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM).  The 

misclassification provided erroneous information in the Statement of Financial 

Performance on the true expenses incurred for the year. (Paragraph No. 1) 

 

We recommended that: 

 

a. The Acting Chief Accountant ensure that disbursements are recorded 
with due regard to the actual nature of the transaction and use as 

guide for the description provided for each account in the Revised 

Chart of Accounts of the GAM rather than on the basis of the ORS; 

and 

 

b. Management, in the future, oversee the necessary revision of its 
budget, within the limits set forth under Section 70 of the General 

Provision of the General Appropriations Act (GAA), before it even 

spends for new programs, projects and activities. 

 

2. The purchases of donated foodstuff and medical supplies/materials to various 
beneficiaries totaling P4.267 million could not be fully accounted for reasons 

that 1) the exact quantity per item of donated supplies/materials were not 

indicated in the receiving documents of the recipient-organizations; 2) 

recipients were not properly identified as to their official station and 

position/designation; and 3) some donated goods were not supported with 



iv  

acknowledgment receipts, which deficiencies are inconsistent with the 

provisions of COA Circulars 2020-009 and 2014-002. (Paragraph No. 2) 
 

We recommended that Management submit the acknowledgment receipts 

for the above goods/supplies/materials duly signed by representatives of 

the donee-agencies/ institutions with their official stations and 

position/designation as well as the respective IARs per delivered purchases 

relative to its COVID 19 response activities. 

 

The above findings and recommendations were discussed with 

Management officials concerned. Management views and reactions were 

considered in the report, where appropriate. The details of the above 

observations were discussed in Part II of this report. 

 
 

G. Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 

All seven prior year’s audit recommendations embodied in the 2019 

Annual Audit Report (AAR) were implemented. The details are presented in Part 

III of this report.
