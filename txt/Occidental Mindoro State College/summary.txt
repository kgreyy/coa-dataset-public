SCOPE OF AUDIT

	

	The Audit Team conducted Financial and Compliance Audit on the accounts and operations of the College for CY 2020. It included analysis of accounts in the financial statements, review of transactions and test of compliance with financial rules and regulations and evaluation of the policies, processes and internal control. The objectives of the audit are to ascertain the fairness and reliability of the College’s financial position and financial performance, to determine whether its operations were conducted in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and to assess the level of internal control on the policies and processes of the College.





AUDIT OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements of the College due to the following:



--	Inefficient and ineffective monitoring, controlling and recording of inventories due to weak internal control and incorrect practices contrary to the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) resulted in a) discrepancy of P2,363,858.25 between the accounting records and the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI); b) accumulated shortages and overages; c) non-compliance with accrual basis of accounting; and d) erroneous classification of inventory and expense accounts, thus  rendering the Inventory and Supplies and Materials Expense accounts valued at P8,232,406.15 and  P27,947,998.83, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 inaccurate and unreliable.



--	The accuracy and reliability of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts with carrying value of ₱395,116,976.85 as of December 31, 2020 were doubtful due to (a) non-capitalization of major repairs totalling ₱3,017,257.25; (b) incomplete physical count of PPE for Land, Land Improvements, Buildings and Other Structures with carrying value of ₱303,355,616.32; (c) non-derecognition of unserviceable and disposed properties with net book value of ₱1,243,154.47 and ₱25,000.00, respectively; (d) erroneous classification of PPE accounts valued at ₱16,351,258.78; and (e) recording of 133 units of goods valued at ₱5,220,820.00 in the PPE Ledger Card on a per brand basis and PO instead of on a per item basis contrary to Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volumes I, II and III, thereby affecting the fair presentation of the Financial Statements.





SIGNIFICANT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

	

For the exceptions cited above, we recommended that the Management ensure strict compliance with the provisions set forth in the GAM for NGAs and Presidential Decree No. 1445 and instruct the following:

--	Supply and Accounting Office to observe well the Perpetual Inventory System, accrual basis of accounting, weighted average method and proper classification of accounts;

--	The Supply Office to conduct complete physical count of all the inventories of the College, limit access to stock room to authorized personnel only and conduct thorough investigation and reconciliation of shortages and overages;

--	The Accountant to (a) perform reconciliation between the RPCI and accounting records; (b)  coordinate with the Supply Office and Physical, Plant and Facilities Office to check for issued supplies and materials that are still recorded as inventories as at year-end; (c) capitalize the cost of major repairs and depreciate the same over the remaining life of the PPE; (d) drop from the books the disposed school bus with a carrying value of ₱25,000.00 and other unserviceable properties reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Properties (IIRUP); e) strictly observe appropriate account classification in recording financial transactions and; (f) immediately prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the erroneous recording and classification of inventory and PPE accounts; 

--	The Property/Internal Control Unit to (a) create a detailed plan on how the physical count will be done and indispensably conduct physical count on all the PPEs of the College and (b) conduct the determination of the appraised value of the unserviceable properties at least every quarter to avoid its accumulation that would hamper the timely submission of IIRUP;

--	The Supply Officer to request from the supplier the unit cost of each part of item in a set of the delivered goods in case the purchases involve a part that can be purchased separately to aid in the identification of carrying amounts of specific properties that may require adjustments in case of replacement, impairment, loss and disposal; and

--	All Offices/Units/Departments to immediately report the discovery of an unserviceable property to the Supply and Property/Internal Control Unit to aid them in the timely submission of IIRUP.

In addition, the following are the other significant observations and recommendations in the audit of the College for the year 2020:



1)	The payment of Proportional Vacation Pay (PVP) to regular teaching personnel for the Academic Year (AY) 2019-2020 was not in accordance with CSC Memorandum Circular No. 9, series of 2012, DepEd Memorandum No. 049, series of 2020, and CSC Memorandum Circular No. 8, series of 2014, due to the decision of the Human Resource Management Office (HRMO) to adopt the old guidelines on the grant of PVP which resulted in an overpayment of P114,464.53.



We recommended that the SUC President instruct (a) the Accountant, in coordination with the HRMO, to cause the refund of the overpayment of PVP totalling P114,464.53; henceforth, ensure strict compliance with CSC Memorandum Circular No. 8, series of 2014, and provide separate payroll for the payment of PVP with supporting computations; and (b) the HRMO to ensure strict compliance with the provisions set forth in CSC Memorandum Circular No. 9, series of 2012 and DepEd Memorandum No. 049, series of 2020.



2)	The Office of the Vice-President for Academic Affairs (VPAA) and the Accounting Office committed errors in the (a) computation of Teaching Overload (TO) hours to be paid for; and (b) TO units as basis for the computation of honoraria for AY 2019-2020 in violation of Chapter 7.13.1 of the Manual on Position Classification and Compensation and Board of Trustees (BOT) Resolution No. 79, s. 2017, thus resulting in overpayment of P216,407.89 to 32 faculty members. Moreover, inconsistent assignment of equivalent unit of designation for three faculty members during the same AY did not promote uniform and fair application of BOT Resolution No. 79, s. 2017, among faculty-stakeholders, thereby depriving the concerned faculty members just and commensurate payment for the excess services they have rendered for the College.



We recommended that the SUC President ensure strict compliance with the provisions set forth in Chapter 7.13.1 of the Manual on Position Classification and Compensation regarding payment of honoraria for Teaching Overload and that office orders for designations of College Officials are approved and issued to the designees before the latter take on their duties and responsibilities.



We also recommended that the SUC President instruct: (a) the Vice-President for Administration, Finance and Support Services (VPAFSS), in coordination with the Accountant, to cause the refund of the overpayment of honoraria for TO totalling P216,407.89; (b) the Accountant to ensure accuracy and regularity in the computation of honoraria for TO; (c) the VPAA to ensure regularity and appropriateness in the assignment of equivalent unit of designation in adherence with the provisions set forth in BOT Resolution No. 79, s. 2017 and; (d) the Accountant and the VPAA to closely coordinate with each other to ensure (i) appropriateness of equivalent units of designation and teaching load, both for ‘Prescribed FTE’ and ‘Actual FTE’, and the resulting TO units; and (ii) accuracy and propriety of the duration/time and academic subjects assigned as bases for TO before payment thereof is made.



3)	The College paid honoraria totalling P366,062.50 for BOT-related meetings contrary to the provisions of RA No. 8292 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), thus resulting in overpayment of P366,062.50.



We recommended that the BOT Chair and SUC President (b) ensure strict compliance with the provisions set forth in RA No. 8292 and its IRR regarding payment of honoraria to the Governing Body; (b) refrain from granting honoraria to persons other than the members of the Board during BOT meeting; (c) instruct the members of the Finance Committee to present official receipts in order to claim reimbursement of necessary expenses incurred in relation to their performance of official business duly authorized by resolution of the Board; (d) review the composition and necessity of constituting the Academic Committee; (e) direct the members of the BOT and persons previously mentioned to cause the refund of the overpayment of honoraria totalling P366,062.50; (f) ensure that the student and faculty sectors are well-represented in the Search Committee for BOT members from private sector; and (g) instruct the Accountant to institute control measures and ensure that payment of authorized allowance shall be in accordance with RA No. 8292 and its IRR.
