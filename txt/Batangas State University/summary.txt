EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
A. Introduction 
 
The BatStateU, formerly Pablo Borbon Memorial Institute of Technology, located at Rizal 
Avenue and Alangilan, Batangas City, was founded in 1903 as a manual training school and

2. Financial Performance 

 
C. Scope of Audit 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of the BatStateU and its campuses for the 
year ended December 31, 2020.  The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of 
assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) 
recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (c) determine the extent of 
implementations of prior years’ audit recommendations.   

 
D.  Audit Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 
The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial 
statements of the BatStateU due to the effects of the following noted deficiencies: 
 
1. The accuracy, validity and existence of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account 

balance costing P2,596,669,627.33, net of Construction in Progress (CIP) of 
P769,879,081.14, could not be relied upon due to: a) existence of discrepancies 
between the balance of Statement of Financial Position, and PPE Ledger Cards 
(PPELC) and Report of Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE)  totaling P1,692,753,350.75 
and P18,660,344.61, respectively; b) non-submission of Main Campus RPCPPE to the 
Auditor and Accounting Division/Unit; c) non-provision of depreciation on several PPE 
accounts totaling P917,795.90; and d) maintenance of PPELCs without details of

depreciation and inconsistent with the prescribed template; and contrary to Chapter 10, 
Volume I and Appendices 70 and 73, Volume II of the Government Accounting Manual 
(GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs). Furthermore, the existence of 
discrepancies on depreciation between the balance per Statement of Financial Position, 
and lapsing schedule of depreciation totaling P67,329,260.45, net value, for four PPE 
accounts cast doubts on the accuracy of computed depreciation which may affect the 
reliability of the recorded balances in the Statement of Financial Position. 

 
2. The Accounts Receivable of P127,629,576.74 (gross) was doubtful as to reliability, 

propriety and whether presented at its net realizable value as of December 31, 2020  
due to the: a) presence of negative Subsidiary Ledger (SL) balances totaling 
P216,819,635.54 and unreconciled difference between the SL and its sub-SLs balances 
of P8,344,566.98 in the books of the BatStateU Main; b) inconsistency in the adopted 
policy on the provision for Impairment of Receivables; c) unreconciled balance of 
P6,620,140.50 between the Accounts Receivable-CHED UniFAST and Summary of 
CHED UniFAST Billing and d) absence of breakdown of receivable from various 
students. This is contrary to Sections 58, 111 and 114 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 
1445, Section 12b, Chapter 2, Section 10, Chapter 7 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, 
and Appendices 5 and 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II.  

 
3. The non-closure of Construction in Progress (CIP) accounts for completed projects 

resulted to the understatement of PPE Accounts, Accounts Payable and overstatement 
of CIP accounts totaling P330,652,082.94 in violation of Section 8g, Chapter 10, Volume 
I, GAM for NGAs. 
  

E. Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 
For the exceptions cited above, we recommended that the: 
 
1.  University President/Chancellor enjoin the: 

 
a. University/Campus Accountants to complete the preparation, maintenance and 

updating of PPE Ledger Cards (PPELCs) for PPE items totaling P1,692,753,350.75, 
pursuant to Chapter 10 and Appendix 70 of the GAM for NGAs, Volumes I and II; 
 

b. Campus Accountant and Head of Supply and Property Management Office to 
complete the reconciliation of records, identify the particular/specific PPE for the net 
difference of P18,660,344.61 and make appropriate  adjustment in their respective 
records either through Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) and/or updating of property 
cards; 
 

c. the Property Officer to fast track the reconciliation of PPE accounts and to facilitate 
the submission of the copies of RPCPPE to the Audit Team and the Accounting 
Office pursuant to Appendix 73, Volume II of GAM for NGAs;  
 

d. Vice President for Administration and Finance to closely monitor the preparation, 
maintenance and updating of PPELCs, the submission of RPCPPE and the 
reconciliation of PPE accounts; 
 



 

v 

 

e. Campus Accountant of ARASOF-Nasugbu Campus to exert efforts in locating or 
retrieving available data/documents that will facilitate substantiation of the PPE 
value, needed in the computation of depreciation and provide complete depreciation 
on all PPE items. Thereafter, make the necessary adjustments to correct the 
understatement of Accumulated Depreciation in previous years to be able to present 
the accurate net book value of affected PPE accounts; and 
 

f. Accountant to: 
 
a. prepare the PPELCs for PPE items totaling P2,071,247,145.14 in accordance 

with the prescribed template in Appendix 70 of the GAM for NGAs, Volumes II; 
and 

 
b. verify and identify the particular/specific causes of discrepancy between the 

Financial Statements and the Lapsing Schedule of Depreciation and effect the 
necessary adjustments through JEV for the discrepancies noted amounting to 
P67,329,260.45, net value. 

 
2. University President enjoin the Accountant III: 
 

a. to prioritize the conduct of a thorough review of CY 2020 and prior years’ records to 
account for the negative balances, and effect the necessary adjustments through 
Journal Entry Voucher (JEV).   Consequently, ensure that collections of receivables 
are properly recorded and allocated on their respective ledgers and SL balances 
should be in positive amount and in agreement with the main SL account balance; 

 
b. to re-evaluate the rates of Allowance for Impairment and formulate a written internal 

policy on rates of Allowance for Impairment and initiate the formulation of a written 
internal policy on rates applicable for the University operations that should be 
consistently and properly applied to allow presentation of Receivables at net 
realizable value; 

 
c. to conduct reconciliation on the balances of recorded receivables from CHED and 

CHED UniFAST billings for the difference of P6,620,140.50 and prepare the 
corresponding adjusting journal entry; and  
 

d. coordinate with the Assessment Office to identify the details/breakdown of the 
unaccounted accumulated balance of Accounts Receivable from various students to 
support the recorded balance and properly identify its age. 

3. University President directs the Accountant to reclassify the total cost of completed 
projects from CIP accounts to the appropriate asset accounts.   

 
The other significant observations and recommendations in the audit of the BatStateU for 
CY 2020 are summarized as follows: 

 
1. The Advances to Contractors account includes unrecouped advances in prior years that 

pertain to completed and/or terminated projects for which the University failed to demand 
from contractors the refund, thereby depriving the University of additional funds for its 
operation totalling P15,950,127.27. 



 

vi 

 

We recommended that the University President instruct the Accountant to require the 
contractors concerned to refund the unrecouped amount of P15,950,127.27 for 
terminated and completed projects and/or deduct the amount from the final payment of 
the project or from other money claims of the contractors. 
 

2. The Receivables of P425,286.23 from concessionaires/tenants of canteen spaces 
remained outstanding as of December 31, 2020, thereby depriving the BatStateU’s 
Resource Generation Office (RGO) of additional funds for its income generating 
projects. Further, recorded balance of Operating Lease Receivable compared to RGO’s 
Aging Schedule showed a difference of P1,897.59 as of December 31, 2020.  
 
We recommended that the University President enjoin the: 
 
a) Resource Generation Office to intensify its collection efforts to ensure that 

receivables from various concessionaires are promptly realized for use in its income 
generating projects; 
 

b) the Accountant to determine the cause and nature of deficiency for the amount of 
P1,897.59 before effecting the adjustment through a Journal Entry Voucher (JEV).  
Consequently, conduct periodic reconciliation with the records of RGO to assure that 
the monthly GL and RGO balances are the same to properly present the correct 
balance of the Operating Lease Receivable in the year-end financial statement.  

 
3. Disbursement transactions totaling P6,976,904.90 (net) were paid despite incomplete 

documentation and/or details, contrary to Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular 
No. 2012-001, thereby casting doubts on the authenticity and validity of the transactions 
which may result to the issuance of Notice of Suspension to enforce submission of 
pertinent documents in accordance with the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of 
Accounts. 
 
We recommended that the Chancellors direct the Campus Accountant to stop the 
practice of processing claims without complete supporting documents and submit the 
lacking documents as presented in Annex I, for further evaluation of the Audit Team.  
Otherwise, a Notice of Suspension (NS) will be issued by the Audit Team in accordance 
with the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts.  
 
We also recommended that the Chancellors direct the Official/Employee involved in the 
issuance of POs to ensure its proper release by having it duly received and dated by the 
supplier. 
 

4. Old prescribed style of uniforms which can no longer  be sold to students valued at 
P181,445.75 under Merchandise Inventory as well as damaged inventories valued at 
P22,421.59  have not been disposed of, thus, exposing these Inventory items to further 
physical deterioration, decline in economic value, and loss of opportunity to earn 
additional income had immediate disposal been effected through sale, in compliance 
with Section 79 of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 89-296 dated January 27, 1989. 
Non-disposal also deprived the agency of the use of additional space inside the 
stockroom.  

 
We recommended that the Chancellor direct the: 



 

vii 

 

a) Resource Generation Office to facilitate the disposal of the old design and damaged 
inventories with book value of P203,867.34 to prevent further deterioration of the 
assets and decongest the storage area, in compliance with Section 79 of PD No. 
1445 and COA Circular No. 89-296 dated January 27, 1989; and  

 
b) Accountant to ensure the derecognition of the obsolete inventories under 

Merchandise Inventory as Held for Sale after disposal. 
 
5. Only P8,140,000.00 or 0.48% of the BatStateU budget for CY 2020 amounting 

P1,707,795,000.00 was allotted for Gender and Development (GAD) activities, contrary 
to Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) – National Economic Development 
Authority (NEDA) – Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Joint Circular No. 
2012-01, thus depriving the organization and its clients the programs that tends to 
increase gender awareness and responsiveness. 
 
We recommended that the University President enjoin the Director of Extension 
Services to attribute to the GAD budget a portion or the whole of the budget of the 
BatStateU’s major programs to increase gender responsiveness, in compliance with 
paragraph 6.4 of Joint Circular No. 2012-01 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM. 
 

6. Various GAD planned programs, activities and projects (PAPs) for CY 2020 could not 
be implemented by the BatStateU due to pandemic but still the BatStateU’s GAD Focal 
Point did not opt to revise the University’s GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for CY 2020 as 
provided in the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) Memorandum Circular (MC) 
No. 2020-03,  thus the gender issues and activities identified therein may not have 
addresses the actual issues and concerns arising from the unequal status of men and 
women stakeholders due to the COVID-19 situation. 

 
We recommended that the University President enjoin the Director of Extension 
Services to comply with GAD-related regulations in the preparation or revision of GPBs 
in order to properly address pressing gender issues and concerns during the pandemic. 

The above observations, together with the recommended courses of action were discussed 
by the Audit Team with the concerned BatStateU officials through issuance of Audit 
Observation Memoranda (AOMs) and conduct of exit conference on May 21, 2021. 
 
STATUS OF UNSETTLED SUSPENSIONS, DISALLOWANCES AND CHARGES 
 
The BatStateU had unsettled suspensions and disallowances of P4,104,240.45 and 
P250,178,421.49, respectively, contained in the Summary of Audit Suspensions, 
Disallowances and Charges as of December 31, 2020. 
 
In addition, the Statement of Financial Position showed Receivables-Disallowances and 
Charges of P857,435.77. 
 
STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF PRIOR YEARS’ AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
Of the 112 audit recommendations contained in the 2019 and prior years’ Annual Audit 
Reports, 43 were fully implemented, 57 were partially implemented and the remaining 12 
were not implemented by the concerned officials and employees of the BatStateU.

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of the Batangas State University

and the Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity, 
Statement of Cash Flows, Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts for the 
year ended, and Notes to Financial Statements, including a summary of significant 
accounting policies. 
 
In our opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the Basis for Qualified 
Opinion Section of our report, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present 
fairly, in all material; respects, the financial position of the BatStateU as at December 31, 
2020, and its financial performance, changes in net assets/equity, cash flows and 
comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended in accordance with 
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). 
 
Basis for Qualified Opinion 
 
1. The accuracy, validity and existence of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account 

balance costing P2,596,669,627.33, net of Construction in Progress (CIP) of 
P769,879,081.14, could not be relied upon due to: a) existence of discrepancies 
between the balance of Statement of Financial Position, and PPE Ledger Cards 
(PPELC) and Report of Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE)  totaling P1,692,753,350.75 
and P18,660,344.61, respectively; b) non-submission of Main Campus RPCPPE to the 
Audit Team and Accounting Division/Unit; c) non-provision of depreciation on several

depreciation and inconsistent with the prescribed template; and contrary to Chapter 10, 
Volume I and Appendices 70 and 73, Volume II of the Government Accounting Manual 
(GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs). Furthermore, the existence of 
discrepancies between the balance per Statement of Financial Position and lapsing 
schedule of depreciation totaling P67,329,260.45, net value, for four PPE accounts cast 
doubts on the accuracy of computed depreciation which may affect the reliability of the 
recorded balances in the Statement of Financial Position. 
 

2. The Accounts Receivable of P127,629,576.74 (gross) was doubtful as to reliability, 
propriety and whether presented at its net realizable value as of December 31, 2020

of P8,344,566.98 in the books of the BatStateU Main; b) inconsistency in the adopted 
policy on the provision for Impairment of Receivables; c) unreconciled balance of 
P6,620,140.50 between the Accounts Receivable-CHED UniFAST and Summary of 
CHED UniFAST Billing and d) absence of breakdown of receivable from various 
students. This is contrary to Sections 58, 111 and 114 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 
1445, Section 12b, Chapter 2, Section 10, Chapter 7 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, 
and Appendices 5 and 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II. 

 
3. The non-closure of Construction in Progress (CIP) accounts for completed projects 

resulted to the understatement of PPE Accounts, Accounts Payable and overstatement

Volume I, GAM for NGAs. 
 

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 
Institutions (ISSAIs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further describe in the 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We 
are independent of the agency in accordance with the Revised Code of Conduct and Ethical 
Standards for Commission on Audit Officials (Code of Ethics) together with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the Philippines, and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and 
the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
 
Key Audit Matters 
 
Except for the matters described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion Section, we have 
determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report. 
 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), 
and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due 
to fraud or error. 
 
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the agency’s financial 
reporting process. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue 
an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably

be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 

 
1. General Information/Agency Profile 
 

The consolidated financial statements of Batangas State University (BatStateU) were 
authorized for issue on February 11, 2021 as shown in the Statement of 
Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statements signed by Dr. Tirso A. 
Ronquillo, the President.  

 
The BatStateU, formerly Pablo Borbon Memorial Institute of Technology, located at 
Rizal Avenue and Alangilan, Batangas City, acquired its University status on March 
22, 2001 per Republic Act (RA) No. 9045. It is a multi-campus institution of higher 
learning with extension campuses in the Municipalities of Balayan, Lemery, Lipa, 
Rosario, San Juan, Lobo, and Mabini all in the Province of Batangas.  It has two 
operating units, the Apolinario R. Apacible School of Fisheries (ARASOF) in 
Nasugbu and Jose P. Laurel Polytechnic College (JPLPC) in Malvar, both in 
Batangas Province. 

 
The BatStateU over the past 100 years has developed into an innovative forward 
looking top performing institution, with particular excellence in engineering and a 
well-deserved reputation in accountancy and business education, industrial 
technology and research  

 
The BatStateU is the largest provider of education in the Batangas Province. This 
year, there are over 36,000 students registered in 11 campuses, majority of whom 
are full-time undergraduates.  Likewise, the University produced a total of 5,084 
graduates also this year. 

 
Since 1999, the University was given recognition as a consistent top performing 
school in Mechanical Engineering.  Meanwhile, Electrical Engineering Program is 
gradually gaining recognition as it is being hailed as the top performing school in the 
licensure examination for Electrical Engineers in the past four years. As of December 
31, 2020, the University has produced a total of 192 topnotchers in various licensure 
examinations given by the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) with 
Mechanical Engineering topping the list with 79, followed by Customs Broker with 18 
and Electrical Engineering with 20. 

 
The University employs 2,024 teaching and non-teaching staffs making it one of 
Batangas’ largest employers.  The University continues to be the institution of 
preference of high achieving students with on-going growth in enrolment. 

 
International linkages and collaboration are growing.  They foster opportunities for 
education and research on a global scale.  A number of fee-paying foreign students 
are admitted to the University.  Faculty scholars are sent abroad for post-graduate 
study, trainings and other scholarly collaborative undertakings. 

 
The BatStateU students are recognized for their consistent impressive performance 
in both academic and non-academic competitions on regional, national and even on 
international level. 



 

21 

 

The University curricular programs maintain their quality academic standards through 
accreditation with Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities in the 
Philippines (AACCUP), Philippine Technological Council (PTC) and Accreditation 
Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) US Based International.  

 
The University’s reputation extends to industry demonstrated by its graduates’ 
employment record especially in the field of engineering, technology and accounting. 

 
The University is known for its extensive on-the-job (OJT) training program for 
students designed to enhance their employability, locally and abroad.  It maintains 
close contacts and affiliations with the leading professional, scientific and academic 
institutions and with business industry, for advancement and mutually productive 
undertakings. 
 
In 2018, the BatStateU is recognized as State University and Colleges (SUC) Level 
IV as per CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2018.  It is also rated 3 stars 
in the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), list of top universities.  Moreover, it is a recipient 
of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) issued by the TUV 
Rheinland Philippines, Inc.  The certification is valid from October 15, 2018 until 
January 18, 2021. 
 
In 2020, due to the effects of COVID-19 pandemic, the University shifted from face to 
face instruction to flexible mode of teaching and learning.  The Google Classroom 
became the official Learning Management System (LMS) of the University. 
 
On July 20, 2020, history was made as Batangas State University officially launched 
the country’s first Knowledge, Innovation, Science and Technology (KIST) Park that 
placed BatStateU at the forefront of national development by virtue of Presidential 
Proclamation No. 947, s.2020 dated May 22, 2020. 
 

2. Statement of Compliance and Basis of Financial Statements Preparation  
 

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) issued by the Commission 
on Audit per COA Resolution No. 2020-001 dated January 9, 2020.  
 
The accounting policies have been consistently applied throughout the year 
presented. 

 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical 
cost, unless stated otherwise. The Statement of Cash Flows is prepared using the 
direct method. 
 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in peso, which is the country’s 
functional currency. 
 
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with the adopted IPSAS 
requires the use of certain accounting estimates.  It also requires the entity to 
exercise judgement in applying the entity’s accounting policies. 

 



 

22 

 

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
3.1. Basis of Accounting 

 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis in 
accordance with the IPSAS.  

 
3.2. Consolidation 

 
The consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, 
assets/equity, revenue and expenses of the reporting entity and that of 
Apolinario R. Apacible School of Fisheries (ARASOF) Nasugbu and Jose P. 
Laurel Polytechnic College (JPLPC) Malvar campuses.   
 

3.3. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash in bank, 
deposits on call and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 
three months or less, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash 
and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.    

 
3.4. Inventories 

 
Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition. Inventories encompass 
goods purchased and held for resale.  Inventories also include (a) materials 
and supplies awaiting use in the production process, and (b) goods 
purchased or produced by the entity, which are for distribution to other parties 
for no charge or for a nominal charge.  

 
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
operations less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs 
necessary to make the sale, exchange, or distribution. 
 
Inventories are recognized as an expense when deployed for utilization or 
consumption in the ordinary course of operations of the University. 

 
3.5. Investment Property 

 
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction 
costs. The carrying amount includes the replacement cost of components of 
an existing investment property at the time that cost is incurred if the 
recognition criteria are met and excludes the costs of day-to-day 
maintenance of an investment property.  
 
Transfers are made to or from investment property only when there is a 
change in use. 
 
 
 
 



 

23 

 

3.6. Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) 
 
Recognition 
 
An item is recognized as Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) if it meets the 
characteristics and recognition criteria as a PPE. 
 
The characteristics of PPE are as follows: 
 

 tangible items; 

 are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental 
to others, or for administrative purposes; and 

 are expected to be used during more than one reporting period. 
 

An item of PPE is recognized as an asset if: 
 

 It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated 
with the item will flow to the entity;  

 The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably; and 

 The cost is at least P15,000.00. 
 
Measurement at Recognition 
 
An item recognized as PPE is measured at cost.  A PPE acquired through 
non-exchange transaction is measured at its fair value as at the date of 
acquisition. 
 
The cost of the PPE is the cash price equivalent or, for PPE acquired through 
non-exchange transaction, its cost is its fair value as at recognition date. 
 
Cost includes the following: 
 

 Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase 
taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates; 

 expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items; and 

 initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and 
restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity 
incurs either when the item is acquired, or as a consequence of having 
used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to 
produce inventories during that period. 
 

Measurement after Recognition 
 
After recognition, all PPE are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses. 
 
When significant parts of PPE are required to be replaced at intervals, the 
BatStateU recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful 
lives and depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major 



 

24 

 

repair/replacement is done, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of 
the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are 
satisfied.   All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense 
in surplus or deficit as incurred. 
 
Depreciation 
 
Each part of an item of PPE with a cost that is significant in relation to the 
total cost of the item is depreciated separately. 
 
The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expense unless it is 
included in the cost of another asset. 
 
Initial Recognition of Depreciation 
 
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is 
in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by Management. 
 
For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation is for 
one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month.  
However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, 
depreciation is for the succeeding month. 
 
Depreciation Method 
 
The straight line method of depreciation is adopted unless another method is 
more appropriate for Entity operation. 
 
Estimated Useful Life 
 
The BatStateU uses the life span of PPE prescribed by COA in determining 
the specific estimated useful life for each asset based on its experience. 
 
Residual Value 
 
The BatStateU uses a residual value equivalent to at least five percent of the 
cost of the PPE. 
 
Impairment 
 
An asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount, or 
recoverable service amount, if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its 
estimated recoverable service amount. 
 
Derecognition 
 
The BatStateU derecognizes items of PPE and/or any significant part of an 
asset upon disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential 
is expected from its continuing use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition 



 

25 

 

of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the surplus or deficit 
when the asset is derecognized. 
 

3.7. Leases 
 
BatStateU as a lessor. 
 
Operating Lease 
 
Leases in which the University does not transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. 
 
Rent received from an operating lease is recognized as income on a straight-
line basis over the lease term. Contingent rents are recognized as revenue in 
the period in which they are earned. 
 

3.8. Intangible Assets 
 
Recognition and Measurement 
 
Intangible assets are recognized when the items are identifiable non-
monetary assets without physical substance; it is probable that the expected 
future economic benefits or service potential that are attributable to the 
assets will flow to the entity; and the cost or fair value of the assets can be 
measured reliably. 

 
Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognized at cost.  
 
Subsequent Measurement 
 
The useful life of the intangible assets is assessed as either finite or 
indefinite. Intangible assets with a finite life are amortized over its useful life.  
 
The straight-line method is adopted in the amortization of the expected 
pattern of consumption of the expected future economic benefits or service 
potential. 
 
The amortization period and the amortization method, for an intangible asset 
with a finite useful life, are reviewed at the end of each reporting period.  
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of 
future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the 
amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in 
accounting estimates.  The amortization expense on an intangible asset with 
a finite life is recognized in surplus or deficit as the expense category that is 
consistent with the nature of the intangible asset. 
 
 
 
 



 

26 

 

3.9. Foreign Currency Transactions 
 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recognized by applying the spot 
exchange rate between the function currency and the foreign currency at the 
transaction date.  

 
At reporting date, foreign currency monetary items are translated using the 
closing rate. 
 

3.10. Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions 
 
Recognition and Measurement of Assets from Non-Exchange Transactions 
 
An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction, other than services 
in-kind, that meets the definition of an asset are recognized as an asset if the 
following criteria are met: 
 

 It is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential 
associated with the asset will flow to the entity; and 

 The fair value of the asset can be measured reliably. 
 
An asset acquired through a non-exchange transaction is initially measured 
at its fair value as at the date of acquisition. 
 
Recognition of Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions 
 
An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction recognized as an 
asset is recognized as revenue, except to the extent that a liability is also 
recognized in respect of the same inflow. 
 
Measurement of Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions 
 
Revenue from non-exchange transactions is measured at the amount of the 
increase in net assets recognized by the entity, unless a corresponding 
liability is recognized. 
 
Gifts and Donations 
 
The BatStateU recognizes assets and revenue from gifts and donations when 
it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential will flow to 
the entity and the fair value of the assets can be measured reliably. 
 
Goods in-kind are recognized as assets when the goods are received, or 
there is a binding arrangement to receive the goods. If goods in-kind are 
received without conditions attached, revenue is recognized immediately. If 
conditions are attached, a liability is recognized, which is reduced and 
revenue recognized as the conditions are satisfied. 
 
 
 



 

27 

 

3.11. Revenue from Exchange Transactions 
 
Measurement of Revenue 
 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable. 
 
Sale of Goods 
 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, usually on delivery 
of the goods and when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and 
it is probable that the economic benefits or service potential will flow to the 
University. 
 
Rental Income 
 
Rental income arising from operating leases on investment property is 
accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and included in the 
revenue. 
 

3.12. Budget Information 
 
The annual budget is prepared on a cash basis and is published in the 
BatStateU website. 

 
A separate Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts 
(SCBAA) is prepared since the budget and the financial statements are not 
prepared on comparable basis.  The SCBAA is presented showing the 
original and final budget and the actual amounts on comparable basis to the 
budget. 

 
3.13. Impairment of Non-Financial Assets 

 
Impairment of non-cash-generating assets 
 
The University assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication 
that a non-cash generating asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or 
when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the BatStateU 
estimates the asset’s recoverable service amount. An asset’s recoverable 
service amount is the higher of the non-cash generating asset’s fair value 
less costs to sell and its value in use. 

 
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable service 
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable service amount.   

 
The University classifies assets as cash-generating assets when those 
assets are held with the primary objective of generating a commercial return. 
Therefore, non-cash generating assets would be those assets from which the 



 

28 

 

BatStateU does not intend (as its primary objective) to realize a commercial 
return. 
 

3.14. Employee Benefits 
 
The employees of the BatStateU are members of the Government Service 
Insurance System (GSIS), which provides life and retirement insurance 
coverage. 
 
The University recognizes the undiscounted amount of short term employee 
benefits, like salaries, wages, bonuses, allowances, etc., as expense unless 
capitalized, and as liability after deducting the amount paid.

Accounts Receivables are basically recorded based on the assessed tuition and 
miscellaneous fees of the students every semester. Corresponding Allowance for 
Impairment had been computed to recognize impairment which might arise from non-
collection of fees from dropped out students and any circumstances beyond the 
control of the University. 
 
In 2020, with the Implementation of Republic Act No. 10931 otherwise known as the 
“Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act of 2017” which provides for free 
tuition and school fees in State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) among others, the 
BatStateU was able to collect from Commission on Higher Education – Unified 
Student Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Education (CHED-UniFAST) the   
amount of P315,946,078.00.  
 
Operating Lease Receivables were recorded based on the number of monthly lease 
payments which arose from the lease contract entered by and between the 
University and individual tenants. Tenants were given the right either to operate a 
food kiosk/stall or a photocopying service. 
 
Inter-Agency Receivables amounting to P1,477,184.94 are composed of Due from 
National Government Agencies and Due from Government Owned-Controlled 
Corporations in the amount of P831,196.40 and P645,988.54, respectively.  The Due 
from Government Owned-Controlled Corporations had been existing in the 2002 Trial 
Balance to which no source document can be traced as of reporting date to identify 
the details of the same. The BatStateU is exerting earnest effort to locate any 
possible document that would justify the recognition in the Statement of Financial 
Position. 



 

30 

 

 
The same is true with the Receivables – Disallowance/Charges under Other 
Receivables amounting to P857,435.77.  Of this amount, P31,759.29 pertains to 
Nasugbu which has been in the book for almost 16 years and records/documents 
cannot be located, hence, settlement of which cannot be effected. 
 
Due from Officers and Employees of P8,676.43 includes P4,052.92 pertaining to 
receivable from Loreto Fallarcuna, a permanent driver of the BatStateU who had an 
accident way back in 2009.  This receivable will be fully collected before year 2021 
ends.  
 
Due from Other Funds pertains to the amount of receivable by one fund from another 
fund/s. This arose because of accidental mistake in charging of funds source and 
payment transactions involving multiple funds. This amount shall be collected from 
the corresponding/appropriate fund/s in the succeeding year. 
 
Due from Non-Government Organizations/People’s Organizations of P190,000.00 
represent seed money given to Organization/Association in the selected communities 
where the University has campuses to help them start a livelihood projects.  This is 
being implemented and monitored by the Extension Services Department of the 
University.

The original budgeted amount for receipts and payments refers to the approved appropriations of 
BatStateU as reflected in the National Expenditure Program (NEP)/GAA 2020 and proposed 
Program of Receipts and Expenditures (PRE) 2020 In the amount of P2,566,847,700.00 and 
P2,399,916,480.00, respectively. 

 
The final budgeted amount for receipts of P2,190,029,812.59 refers to the following: 

 
Particulars Amount 

Actual allotment received from DBM P   513,440,628.00 
Actual collections for the year 2020 639,986,452.88

     Total P2,190,029,812.59

The difference between original and final budgeted amounts arises from subsequent 
allotments from DBM which includes monetization of leave credits, terminal leave 
benefits, lump-sum for filling of vacant positions and clothing allowance. 
 
The actual amounts on comparative basis are the actual obligation incurred while the 
difference between the final budget and actual is the unobligated balance for the year 
which is mostly allotted to infrastructure projects of which implementation are 
pending due to various reasons such as failed bidding, ongoing documentation, 
detailed engineering etc. 

 
The net receipts of P129,461,992.05 are composed of the following items: 
 

Particulars Amount 
Reserve fund P  74,963,159.06 
IGP capital for new projects 18,220,358.61 
Other sources of receipts  36,278,474.38 

     Total  P129,461,992.05 
 
The actual amounts on comparable basis (budget) versus the actual amount 
reflected in the consolidated financial statements differ in a way that the approved 
budget was prepared on a cash basis, while that of the consolidated financial 
statements was on accrual basis. 
 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

PART II 

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
1. The accuracy, validity and existence of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) 

account balance costing P2,596,669,627.33, net of Construction in Progress (CIP) 
of P769,879,081.14, could not be relied upon due to: a) existence of discrepancies 
between the balance per Statement of Financial Position, and PPE Ledger Cards 
(PPELC) and Report of Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) totaling P1,692,753,350.75 
and P18,660,344.61, respectively; b) non-submission of Main Campus RPCPPE to 
the Audit Team and Accounting Division/Unit; c) non-provision of depreciation on 
several PPE accounts totaling P917,795.90; and d) maintenance of PPELCs without 
details of depreciation and inconsistent with the prescribed template contrary to 
Chapter 10, Volume I and Appendices 70 and 73, Volume II of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs). Furthermore, 
the existence of discrepancies on depreciation between the balance per Statement 
of Financial Position and lapsing schedule of depreciation totaling P67,329,260.45, 
net value, for four PPE accounts cast doubts on the accuracy of computed 
depreciation which may affect the reliability of the recorded balances in the 
Statement of Financial Position. 

 
a) Existence of discrepancies between the balance per Statement of Financial 

Position, and PPE Ledger Cards (PPELC) and Report of Physical Count of PPE 
(RPCPPE) of Main and Nasugbu Campuses totaling P1,692,753,350.75 and 
P18,660,344.61, respectively, and non-submission of Main Campus RPCPPE to 
the Audit Team and Accounting Division/Unit 

 
Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides: 
 

“Accounting and Property Records to be maintained for PPE.  The Chief 
Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE xxx. For 
check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise 
maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and 
disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with 
PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit.” 

 
Furthermore, Appendix 70 of the same Manual, Volume II provides that “The PPELC 
shall be reconciled with the report on the physical count of the PPE, PC and the control 
accounts. Any discrepancies shall be immediately verified and adjusted”. 

 
Meanwhile, Appendix 73 states that the RPCPPE “shall be submitted to the Auditor 
and Accounting Division/Unit not later than January 31 of each year”. 
 
The consolidated PPE account of Batangas State University (BatStateU) comprised 
of Main, Malvar and Nasugbu Campuses showed a year-end ofP2,596,669,627.33, 
net of Construction in Progress (CIP) of P769,879,081.14.  
 
Main and Nasugbu Campuses with PPE balances totaling P2,311,859,911.55, 
exclusive of CIP of P753,353,238.12, showed differences of P1,692,753,350.75 and 
P18,660,344.61, respectively, as compared with PPELC and RPCPPE as shown on 
the next page: 
 
 



43 

  

 
 
 

This is a reiteration of prior year’s audit findings. As stated in the Status of 
Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations as of December 31, 2020, the 
Management of Main Campus already hired an Accounting Staff specifically 
designated to reconcile the PPE and maintain and update the PPELCs and other task 
related to it.  

 
As can be gleaned from the table above, comparison of balances between the SFP 
and the RPCPPE of Main Campus could not be made due to the non-submission of 
the RPCPPE as of December 31, 2020 by the Property and Supply Office. 

 
Inquiry with the Property and Supply Office disclosed that they are still conducting 
reconciliation of the PPE accounts, thus submission of the RPCPPE could not be 
made on time.

On the other hand, the discrepancy between the SFP and PPELC balances of Main 
Campus totaling P1,674,268,453.84was mainly due to the non-maintenance of a 
complete PPELCs by the Accounting Office specifically School Buildings, Other 
Structures, Office Equipment, Information and Communication Technology 
Equipment, Technical and Scientific Equipment, Furniture and Fixtures, and Books. 
The discrepancy showed an increase of P635,530,227.70 or 61.18% as compared to 
prior year’s discrepancy of P1,038,738,226.14 despite the updating and preparation 
of PPELCs by the Accounting Office.  

  
For Apolinario R. Apacible School of Fisheries (ARASOF) - Nasugbu Campus, the 
discrepancies already existed in prior years’ and the management has commented 
that the documents pertaining to prior years can no longer be located so they are 
exerting best efforts to reconcile the PPE balances based on available records. 
 
In view of the foregoing, the PPE account balance of P2,596,669,627.33, net of CIP 
of P769,879,081.14, was doubtful as to accuracy, validity, and existence due to the 
presence of discrepancies between the Statement of Financial Position, and PPELC 
and RPCPPE amounting to P1,692,753,350.75 and P18,660,344.61, respectively, 
and non-submission of RPCPPE of Main Campus, contrary to the pertinent provisions 
of GAM for NGAs.  
 
We recommended that the University President and concerned Chancellor 
enjoin the: 
 
a) University/Campus Accountants to complete the preparation, maintenance 

and updating of PPE Ledger Cards (PPELCs) for PPE items with 
discrepancies  totaling P1,692,753,350.75, pursuant to Chapter 10 and 
Appendix 70 of the GAM for NGAs, Volumes I and II; 
 

b) Campus Accountant and Head of Supply and Property Management Office 
to complete the reconciliation of records, identify the particular/specific PPE 
for the net difference of P18,660,344.61 and make appropriate  adjustment in 
their respective records either through Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) and/or 
updating of property cards; and 
 

c) the Property Officer to fast track the reconciliation of PPE accounts and to 
facilitate the submission of the copies of RPCPPE to the Audit Team and the 
Accounting Office pursuant to Appendix 73, Volume II of GAM for NGAs. 
 

d) Vice President for Administration and Finance to closely monitor the 
preparation, maintenance and updating of PPELCs, the submission of 
RPCPPE and the reconciliation of PPE accounts.  

 
Management’s Comments: 

 
For the observations noted on PPE accounts of Main Campus, the following were 
cited: 

 
1. The Accountant III mentioned that the discrepancies were from the remaining 

unreconciled accounts under PPE which includes furniture and fixtures, 
information and communications technology equipment, school buildings, office 



45 

  

equipment and other structures.  Due to the decentralization, the personnel 
previously handling the reconciliation of PPE accounts and maintenance of PPE 
Ledger Cards was assigned to the constituent campuses, thus, the Accounting 
Office- Central Administration will hire a staff who will be assigned in the said task. 
 

2. The Property Officer commented that the Property and Supply Office is on the 
process of final editing and checking the copy of the Report on the Physical Count 
of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE).  After which, the RPCPPE will be 
sent to the Vice President for Administration and Finance, then to the President for 
signature. 

 

3. The Vice President for Administration and Finance is directed to closely monitor 
the preparation, maintenance and updating of PPELCs, the submission of 
RPCPPE and reconciliation of PPE accounts of the BatStateU Main. 

 

On the other hand, the ARASOF-Nasugbu commented that the recommendations 
were highly noted.  The Heads of the Accounting Office and Property and Supply 
Office committed to complete the reconciliation of records and identify the 
particular/specific Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) for proper adjustment of 
respective records.  

 
b) Non-provision of depreciation on several PPE accounts of BatStateU-ARASOF 

Campus totaling P917,795.90 
 
Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I covers the following: 

 
“Sec. 27.Depreciation.  PPE gradually loses its ability to provide service 
over the course of time. Because of this, its cost needs to be distributed 
on a systematic basis over its useful life.   The allocated cost is referred 
to as depreciation.  The depreciation charge for each period shall be 
recognized as expense unless it is included in the carrying amount of 
another asset.  xxx The following are policies regarding depreciation of 
PPE:  

 
xxx 

 
b. Except for land and not recognized heritage assets, all PPE shall be 

depreciated.  (emphasis ours) 
 
Sec. 40.Idle, Unserviceable and Fully Depreciated PPE. A PPE is said to 
be fully depreciated when the carrying amount is equal to zero or residual 
value. The cost of fully depreciated assets remaining in service and the 
related accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses 
shall not be removed from the accounts. 

 
Review of the Statement of Financial Position disclosed that the PPE account balance 
of ARASOF-Nasugbu Campus totaling P240,612,766.41 included several PPE 
accounts amounting to P917,795.90which were not provided with depreciation during 
the year and since their acquisition in prior years, to wit: 

 



46 

  

Account Amount 

Fund 101   

Office Equipment    P161,550.00 

Information and Communication Technology Equipment  321,090.00 

Communication Equipment   45,696.00 

Other Machinery and Equipment   10,415.00 

Furniture and Fixtures   235,105.80 

Sub-total  773,856.80 

Fund 164   

Machinery  123,639.10 

Agricultural and Forestry Equipment  20,300.00 

Sub-total  143,939.10 

Total  P917,795.90 

 
Again, this is a reiteration of prior years’ finding to which management commented that 
they do not stop on looking for documents from all possible places/storage rooms 
where records regarding PPE can be found.  

 
The non-provision of depreciation understated the Depreciation Expenses and 
Accumulated Depreciation of the affected accounts as of year-end. 
 
We recommended that the Chancellor of ARASOF-Nasugbu Campus enjoin the 
Campus Accountant to exert efforts in locating or retrieving available 
data/documents that will facilitate substantiation of the PPE value, needed in the 
computation of depreciation and provide complete depreciation on all PPE 
items. Thereafter, make the necessary adjustments to correct the 
understatement of Accumulated Depreciation in previous years to be able to 
present the accurate net book value of affected PPE accounts. 
 
Management’s Comments: 
 
The ARASOF-Nasugbu commented that the Accounting Office will exert all efforts to 
locate and retrieve available data/documents that will facilitate substantiation of PPE 
value needed for the adjustment of the accumulated depreciation. 
 

c) Maintenance of PPELCs without details of depreciation and inconsistent with 
the prescribed template and existence of discrepancies on depreciation 
between the balance per Statement of Financial Position and lapsing schedule 
totaling P67,329,260.45, net value, for four PPE accounts of Main Campus 
 
Appendix 70 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II provides that “The PPELC shall be kept 
in the Accounting Division/Unit for each class of PPE. The Accounting Staff in charge 
in maintaining the PPELC shall record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, 
estimated life, depreciation, impairment, issue/transfers/disposal, repair history and 
other information about the property. It shall be maintained by fund cluster.”  
 
Verification of the PPELCs prepared by the Main Campus’ Accounting Office disclosed 
that the format was inconsistent with the prescribed template in Appendix 70 of GAM 



47 

  

for NGAs, Volume II. The PPELCs the Accounting Office maintained were by account 
instead of by type of PPE and do not contain details such as estimated useful life, rate 
of depreciation, accumulated depreciation, and other necessary details, wherever 
applicable, such as accumulated impairment losses, issues/transfers/adjustments, 
adjusted cost, repair history and other information about the property. Instead, the 
PPELCs are almost similar to a disbursement record. 

 
In lieu of the absence of the depreciation details in the PPELCs, the Accounting 
submitted the Lapsing Schedule as of December 31, 2020 but for four PPE accounts 
only, namely, Water Supply, Power Supply, School Buildings, and Other Structures. 
Verification of the details of the said schedule disclosed discrepancies in the 
computation of depreciation as compared with the recorded accumulated depreciation 
in the SFP, viz: 

 
 Water Supply 

Systems 
Power Supply 

Systems 
School 

Buildings 
Other 

Structures 

SFP     
Total PPE P3,160,962.98 P81,229,122.41 P1,210,833,726.42 P71,738,592.80

Total PPE 0.00 0.00 8,727,249.20 315,414.78

Net Value 148,187.10 5,254,870.70 65,798,166.59 (3,871,963.94) 
Grand Total-Net Value    67,329,260.45 

 
It can be gleaned from the above table that the recorded Accumulated Depreciation of 
Water and Power Supply Systems showed discrepancies (understatement) of 
P148,187.10 and P5,254,870.70, respectively, whereas, School Buildings and Other 
Structures accounts showed discrepancies in the total PPE (overstatement) as well as 
Accumulated Depreciation balances (net understatement), thus resulting to a 
discrepancy in the net value of P65,798,166.59 and P3,871,963.94, respectively. This 
showed that the recorded net value of the above PPE accounts was overstated by 
P67,329,260.45 due to the understated balance of recorded Accumulated 
Depreciation. 

 
Other PPE accounts were not provided with lapsing schedules. Verification of monthly 
recording of depreciation expense in the General Journal revealed that the basis of 
recording was just the summary of computed monthly depreciation per PPE account 
without other details such as Cost and estimated useful life. Hence, accuracy and 
correctness of the computed depreciation could not be ascertained. 

  
In view of the foregoing, the Main Campus’ PPE account balance of 
P2,071,247,145.14, net of CIP of P753,353,238.12, was doubtful as to accuracy, 
validity, and existence due to the non-maintenance of PPELCs in accordance with the 
prescribed template is contrary to the pertinent provisions of GAM for NGAs and the 
existence of discrepancies between the balance of Statement of Financial Position, 
and lapsing schedule of depreciation totaling P67,329,260.45, net value, for four PPE 
accounts affected the reliability of the financial statements as of year-end. 



48 

  

 
We recommended that the University President enjoin the Accountant to: 

 
a) prepare the PPELCs for PPE items totaling P2,071,247,145.14 in accordance 

with the prescribed template in Appendix 70 of the GAM for NGAs, Volumes 
II; and 
 

b) verify and identify the particular/specific causes of discrepancy between the 
Financial Statements and the Lapsing Schedule of Depreciation and effect 
the necessary  adjustments through Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) for the 
discrepancies noted amounting to P67,329,260.45, net value. 

 
Management’s Comments: 

 
The Accountant cited that the Accounting Office will be starting to update the template 
and details in PPELCs once the staff was hired.  Furthermore, the discrepancies 
between the balance per Statement of Financial Position and Lapsing Schedule were 
already adjusted in the books in January 2021. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 

The Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) for the adjustment of discrepancies were verified 
consisting of GJ RTF JEV No. 006, GJ-163 JEV Nos. 005 and 006, GJ-164 JEV Nos. 
008 to 011 and GJ-101 JEV Nos. 009 and 010. However, we maintain our observation 
as part of this report since the adjustments were made after December 31, 2020. 
 

2. The Accounts Receivable of P127,629,576.74 (gross) was doubtful as to reliability, 
propriety and whether presented at its net realizable value as of December 31, 2020 
due to the: a) presence of negative Subsidiary Ledger (SL) balances totaling 
P216,819,635.54 and unreconciled difference between the SL and its sub-SLs 
balances of P8,344,566.98 in the books of the BatStateU Main; b) inconsistency in 
the adopted policy on the provision for Impairment of Receivables; c) unreconciled 
balance of P6,620,140.50 between the Accounts Receivable-CHED UniFAST and 
Summary of CHED UniFAST Billing and d) absence of breakdown of receivable from 
various students. This is contrary to Sections 58, 111 and 114 of Presidential Decree 
(PD) No. 1445, Section 12b, Chapter 2, Section 10, Chapter 7 of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, 
and Appendices 5 and 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II.  
 
Section 58 of PD No. 1445 states: 

 
“Audit of assets. The examination and audit of assets shall be performed with 
a view to ascertaining their existence, ownership, valuation and encumbrances 
as well as the propriety of items composing the respective asset accounts, 
determining their agreement with records; proving the accuracy of such 
records; ascertaining if the assets were utilized economically, efficiently and 
effectively; and evaluating the adequacy of controls over the accounts.” 

 
Further, Sections 111 (1) and 114 (2) of PD No. 1445 provide that “The accounts of the 
agency shall be kept in detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the 



49 

  

same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of 
the government.  Subsidiary ledgers shall be kept where necessary.” 
 
Section 12 (b), Chapter 2, Volume I of GAM for NGAs provides for the following: 
 

“Sec. 12. Books of Accounts and Registries. The books of accounts and 
registries of the NG entities consist of:  

  a. xxx 
b. Ledgers  
1. General Ledgers (Appendix 5)  
2. Subsidiary Ledgers (Appendix 6)” 

 
Likewise, Appendices 5 and 6, Volume II of the same Manual emphasizes the General 
and Subsidiary Ledgers. 
 

Subsidiary ledger shows the detail for each control account in the GL which is maintained 
per account and fund cluster by the Accounting Division/Unit. It shall be accomplished in 
accordance with the instructions in Appendix 6. At the end of each month, after all 
transactions in the journals have been posted, the debit and credit columns of each 
account shall be footed in pencil and the balance indicated in ink.  
 
The totals of the SL balances shall be reconciled with the corresponding GL controlling 
account. At the end of the fiscal year, each SL shall be ruled and closed.  All totals shall 
be written legibly in ink and the balance of the account carried forward as the opening 
balance of the new SL for the next fiscal year. 
 
Section 10, Chapter 7 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, sets forth the regulations on 
Impairment of Financial Assets, as follows: 

 
“An entity shall assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any 
objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is 
impaired.  If any such evidence exists, the entity shall measure the amount of 
loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s 
original effective interest rate.  The carrying amount of the asset shall be 
reduced either directly or through use of an allowance account.  The amount 
of the loss shall be recognized in surplus or deficit.   
 
In case of Accounts Receivable, the Allowance for Impairment shall be provided 
in an amount based on collectability of receivable balances and evaluation of 
such factors as aging of accounts, collection experiences of the agency, 
expected loss experiences and identified doubtful accounts.” 

 
a)  The Accounts Receivable of P105,477,519.62 (gross) of BatStateU Main was 

doubtful as to reliability and propriety due to the presence of negative 
subsidiary ledger balances totaling P216,819,635.54 and unreconciled 
difference between the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) and its Sub-SLs Ledger balances 
of P8,344,566.98.   

 
The year-end GL/SL balances of P105,477,519.62 showed a difference of 
P8,344,566.98 against its sub-SL balances of P113,822,086.60. Review of subsidiary 



50 

  

ledgers disclosed that the negative balance of P216,819,635.54 as of December 31, 
2020 showed a significant increase of P67,100,107.77 or 44.82% as compared to CY 
2019 negative balance of P149,719,527.77, viz: 

 
Particulars             Amount 

  
Accounts Receivable -Tuition Fees P(216,818,855.54) 
Accounts Receivable – Reservation Fees              (780.00) 
     Total P(216,819,635.54) 
     CY 2019 Negative Balance P(149,719,527.77) 
     Increase (44.82%)  P (67,100,107.77) 

 
This is a reiteration of prior year’s finding that was incorporated in the CY 2019 Annual 
Audit Report (AAR). It may be recalled that the negative SL balances of AR-Tuition 
Fees and AR-ID started in January 2014 where there were records of collections but 
there were no corresponding receivables. Also, the person in-charge of 
recording/setting up AR stated that she was not sure whether or not the assessments 
provided by the Assessment Office was final and no longer subject to adjustments.  
Clearly, there was an error in recording of receivables.  
 
As stated in the Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
(SIPYAR) as of December 31, 2020, the University President instructed the 
Accountant III to review pertinent prior years’ records to determine the cause of 
unreconciled balances as well as the presence of negative SL balances to which the 
Accountant III commented that she will assign the bookkeeper and the Accountant II 
specifically to lead the reconciliation. However, same remained “Not Implemented”.   
 
Inquiry with the Accountant disclosed that the significant increase in the negative 
balance was due to the erroneous recording of collections of AR under one SL,  AR-
Tuition Fees, instead of breaking down the collected amount to different SLs of AR 
such as registration fees, laboratory fees and the like.  
 
The negative AR SL balances totaling P216,819,635.54 understated the AR rendering 
the account balance of P105,477,519.62 (gross) doubtful as to reliability and propriety.  
 
Furthermore, the unreconciled balance between the SL and its sub-SL amounting to 
P8,344,566.98 as of December 31, 2020 still existed, thus reconciliation was still not 
made and erroneous recording of receivables remain unadjusted as of year-end.  
 
We reiterated our recommendations that the University President enjoin the 
Accountant III to prioritize the conduct of a thorough review of CY 2020 and prior 
years’ records to account for the negative balances, and effect the necessary 
adjustments through Journal Entry Voucher (JEV).   Consequently, ensure that 
collections of receivables are properly recorded and allocated on their 
respective ledgers and SL balances should be in positive amount and in 
agreement with the main SL account balance.   

 
Management’s Comments: 
 
The Management commented that the Accounting Office had gathered the relevant 
data needed for reconciliation and had started the review in December last year after 



51 

  

prioritizing the reconciliation of GSIS premiums paid with premiums due. The 
Accountant III explained that the two personnel previously assigned to the job were 
transferred to the budget office due to decentralization and the Office is presently in 
the process of requesting for additional staff who will be assigned to continue the 
reconciliation of accounts receivable and other problematic accounts. 
 

b) The adopted policy on the provision for Impairment of Receivables cast doubts 
on whether the balance as of December 31, 2020 amounting P113,368,453.91, 
net of Allowance for Impairment of P5,688,207.43, were presented at its 
estimated realizable value as required by Section 10 of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume 
I.   

 
The Aging Schedule of Accounts Receivable from students and Scholarship grants,  
as of December 31,2020, with an aggregate total of P119,056,661.34, consisted of 
the following: 
 

 

 

 
As can be gleaned from the table above, the past due Accounts Receivable totaling 
P58,254,567.85 mostly pertained to financial assistance/scholarship grants to 
BatStateU, viz: 

 

 P49,050,069.15 or 46.50% of the total Accounts Receivable of BatStateU Main 
Campus were already past due with age of over three years to 13 years. These 
receivables were a result of the financial assistance/scholarship grants from 
Congressman Mendoza and the City of Lipa during the terms of Mayor Oscar 
Gozos and Mayor Meynardo A. Sabili. The scholarship grants representing tuition 
fees of scholars of the 4th District of Batangas and City of Lipa were considered 
doubtful of collections considering the declaration by the Supreme Court of the 
unconstitutionality of the Priority Development Assistance Program (PDAF), the

change of District Representative as a result of the May 9, 2016 national election 
and lack of appropriation by the City of Lipa.    

 

 P5,292,512.75 or 100 percent of the total receivable from the City Government of 
Lipa under BatStateU JPLPC Campus with age of over three years to six years 
were also a result of the financial assistance granted to 263 students for second 
semester academic year (AY) 2013-2014, 369 students for second semester AY 
2015-2016, and 239 students for first semester AY 2016-2017; 
 

 P3,911,985.95 or 47.21% of the total P8,286,628.97 receivables of BatStateU 
JPLPC Campus were from various students was also considered past due with 
age of over one year to three years.  

 
As stated in the SIPYAR as of December 31, 2020, the BatStateU Main Campus 
already sent follow-up letters in July 2020 to then Congressman Mendoza and the 
current Lipa City Mayor, copy furnished the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Lipa, 
reiterating the request for payments of P25,131,611.11 and P23,918,459.04, 
respectively.  Neither response nor payment had been received thus, the same 
balance of receivables existed as of December 31, 2020.  

 
Review of the Statement of Financial Position disclosed that the Allowance for 
Impairment was computed at 5% of  the total accounts receivables.  
 
It may be recalled that the Audit Team already recommended Management the 
formulation of a written internal policy on rates applicable for the Campus’ operations 
that should be consistently and properly applied to allow presentation of Receivables 
at net realizable value. However, as of December 31, 2020, they have not yet 
formulated a written internal policy on the rate of impairment allowance.  
 
Comparison of rates of impairment allowance with the BatStateU’s Operating Units 
disclosed that the JPLPC-Malvar Campus’ Accountant is still in coordination with the 
Main Campus as to the applicable rates and thus, have not yet formulated a written 
internal policy on rate of impairment allowance and still using its uniform 5% rate as 
impairment allowance for all its receivables. On the other hand, the ARASOF-Nasugbu 
Campus formulated its own internal policy for applicable rates of allowance for 
impairment ranging from 10% to 60% depending on age of Accounts Receivable. 

 
Thus, it is uncertain whether the subject rate of allowance for impairment currently 
being applied by the Accountants are apt for Main and JPLPC-Malvar Campuses 
operations to allow presentation of Receivables at net realizable value considering the 
fund source of scholarship grants under Congressman Mendoza, the lack of 
appropriation from the City of Lipa, the age of past due accounts receivables and the 
collection experience of the University. 

 
We reiterated our recommendation that the University President enjoin the 
Accountant to re-evaluate the rates of Allowance for Impairment and initiate the 
formulation of a written internal policy on rates applicable for the University 
operations that should be consistently and properly applied to allow 
presentation of Receivables at net realizable value.

Management’s Comments: 
 

The Main Campus’ Accountant III mentioned that rates of Allowance for Impairment 
will be re-evaluated and written internal policy on rates applicable for the University 
operations will then be formulated. 
 
The BatStateU JPLPC-Malvar also commented that applicable rates of allowance for 
impairment was still in coordination with Main Campus, however, they are also 
considering the formulation of their own internal policy within the year. They also 
assured that preferential attention will be given on this matter. 

 
c)  The Accounts Receivable-CHED UniFAST of P24,511,504.00 and Accounts 

Receivable - Various Students of P31,915,946.47 could not be relied upon due to 
the unreconciled balance of P6,620,140.50 as compared with the Summary of 
CHED UniFAST Billing and absence of breakdown of receivable from various 
students, thus affecting the reliability and fair presentation of total Accounts 
Receivables in the Financial Statements. 

 
Republic Act No. 10931, also known as the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary 
Education Act provides free tuition and other school fees to students who intend to 
earn tertiary or technical-vocational education in state universities and colleges 
(SUCs), local universities and colleges (LUCs) and technical-vocational institutions 
(TVIs) across the Philippines. 
 
The implementation of the program initially started in the 1st semester of SY 2017 – 
2018 which covers Free Tuition to all qualified enrolled students followed by the Free 
Higher Education Program in the 1st semester of SY 2018-2019 which covers both 
tuition and miscellaneous fees. 
 
Verification of the Campus’ Aging of Accounts Receivable as of December 31, 2020 
showed that receivables from CHED UniFAST of P24,511,504.00 is composed of 
cultural and athletic fees rebilled for the 1st Semester of AY 2020-2021.  
 
However, comparison with the Schedule of Accounts Receivable for CHED UniFAST 
and CHED UniFAST Billing for AY 2017-2021 disclosed that the BatStateU still have 
a total receivable of P31,131,644.50 to CHED UniFAST as of year-end, to wit:

Accounts Receivable-CHED UniFAST  P 24,511,504.00 

Difference P 6,620,140.50 

 
Thus, the recorded Accounts Receivable-CHED UniFAST was understated by 
P6,620,140.50. 
 
On the other hand, the recorded Accounts Receivable from various students 
amounted to P31,915,946.47 aged 91-365 days however, breakdown of the said 
amount could not be provided by the Accountant.  
 
Verification of the General Journals disclosed that the Accounting Office records 
Assessment of students by debiting Accounts Receivable and crediting the income 
account, School Fees. Upon collection, the corresponding Accounts Receivable was 
credited.  
 
It can be understood based on the above practice that the balance of Accounts 
Receivable as at year-end was the running balance of all the recordings made by the 
Accounting, thus the balance was presented only in one column in aging schedule, 
that is 91-365 days. However, it is clear that the said balance does not only pertain to 
the current semester since it was an accumulated balance of receivables. 
 
Comparison with the BatStateU’s Operating Units on the balances of its Accounts 
Receivables from various students disclosed that the Aging Schedules were supported 
with the breakdown of receivables from various students per semester and the age of 
the receivables were also properly presented.  
 
Inquiry with the Assessment Office revealed that the generated assessment after the 
enrolment period was provided to Accounting Office as reference in their recording of 
Accounts Receivable and School Fees, however, the balances after the end of each 
semesters were not generated nor requested by the Accounting Office to support the 
balances of the receivable account. 
 
The understatement of P6,620,140.50 in the recorded receivable from CHED 
UniFAST and existence of unaccounted breakdown of receivable from various 
students affect the fair presentation of total Accounts Receivable in the financial 
statements.  

 
We recommended that the University President require the Accountant to: 

 
a) conduct reconciliation on the balances of recorded receivables from CHED 

and CHED UniFAST billings for the difference of P6,620,140.50 and prepare 
the corresponding adjusting journal entry; and  

 
b) coordinate with the Assessment Office to identify the details/breakdown of 

the unaccounted accumulated balance of Accounts Receivable from various 
students to support the recorded balance and properly identify its age.

Management’s Comments: 
 
The recorded Receivables from CHED per accounting books is for the Main Campus 
only which will not equal with the CHED UniFAST Billings (consolidated) as it also 
includes billings for Nasugbu and Malvar Campuses. Upon the preparation of the 
Schedule of CHED UniFAST Billings it was compared with the Campus Aging of 
Accounts Receivables and omissions were found. Furthermore, the total of the cultural 
and athletic fees re-billed amounting to Ᵽ24,511,504.00 was recorded fully in the 
books wherein the corresponding fees for Nasugbu and Malvar Campuses should be 
deducted. Reconciliation has already been done while the corresponding revisions are 
reflected in the Campus’ Aging of Accounts Receivable as attached. 
 
The identification of the details of the unaccounted accumulated balance of Accounts 
Receivable from various students is also included in the duties and responsibilities of 
the staff who will be hired for the reconciliation of the said account. 

 
3. The non-closure of Construction in Progress (CIP) accounts for completed projects 

resulted to the understatement of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) Accounts, 
Accounts Payable and overstatement of CIP accounts totaling P330,652,082.94, in 
violation of Section 8g, Chapter 10, Volume I, GAM for NGAs. 

        
Section 8g, Chapter 10, Volume I, GAM for NGAs provides that “during construction 
period, all expenses incurred in relation to the construction of PPE shall be taken up in the 
books as Construction in Progress (CIP), with the appropriate asset classification.  As 
soon as the construction is completed, the CIP account shall be reclassified to the proper 
asset account. 
 
The total reported balance of CIP accounts as of year-end totaled P769,879,081.14 of 
which P753,353,238.12 pertains to CIP account of Main Campus.  Verification of the 
supporting schedules revealed that some projects were not reported in the Quarterly 
Government Projects/Programs/Activities as of the last quarter of CY 2020.  
Consequently, we inquired on the status of those projects with the Accountant and 
gathered that the amount of P330,652,082.94 (Annex E) pertains to completed projects 
which were not reclassified or transferred to the appropriate asset accounts broken down 
as follows: 

 
Construction in Progress- Infrastructure Assets P2,688,472.83 
Construction in Progress- Land Improvements 35,356,471.96 
Construction in Progress- Buildings and Other 
Structures 

 
292,607,138.15 

Total P330,652,082.94 
 

The late recording of completed projects to the appropriate asset accounts is not in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 8g, Chapter 10, Volume I, GAM for NGAs which 
requires the recognition of the completed projects in the books of accounts during the 
period the completion occurs.  Absence of this adjustment would result to understatement 
of assets and payables and overstatement of the CIP account. 
 
We recommended that the University President direct the Accountant to reclassify 
the total cost of completed projects from CIP accounts to the appropriate asset 
accounts.   



56 

  

 
Management’s Comments: 
 

Management commented that the Accountant will start reclassification of all items of 
completed projects from CIP accounts to their appropriate asset accounts. 

 
4. The Advances to Contractors account includes unrecouped advances in prior years 

that pertain to completed and/or terminated projects for which the University failed 
to demand from contractors the refund, thereby depriving the University of 
additional funds for its operation totallingP15,950,127.27. 

 

Advances to Contractors as defined in the Revised Chart of Accounts is the account used 
to record amount advanced to contractors as authorized by law. 

 
Paragraph 4.3, Annex E of the Revised IRR of RA 9184 provides that the advance 
payment shall be repaid by the contractor by deducting fifteen percent (15%) from his 
periodic progress payments a percentage equal to the percentage of the total contract 
price used for the advance payment.  
 

As at December 31, 2020, the Advances to Contractor account amounted to 
P48,291,314.05.  Review and analysis of the account of Main Campus totaling 
P46,888,352.95disclosed that the year-end balance included past due advances 
aggregating P15,950,127.27 that remained unrecouped despite completion and/or 
termination of the related projects.  
 
The projects with unrecouped past due advances were either terminated/rescinded or 
completed but no final payment was claimed, details of which is shown in the table below:

Consequently, the unrecouped balances outstanding from 2016 to 2020 tied up the 
University funds in receivables, increasing the risk of non-collection and placing the 
government at a disadvantage for possible loss of government funds.  
 
We recommended that the University President instruct the Accountant to require 
the contractors concerned to refund the unrecouped amount of P15,950,127.27 for 
terminated and completed projects and/or deduct the amount from the final 
payment of the project or from other money claims of the contractors. 
 
Management’s Comments: 
 

The Management commented that the unrecouped amount for terminated and completed 
projects will be deducted from the final payment of the projects of the contractors with 
future claims or collectibles as presented in the submitted schedule.  Contractors without 
unclaimed balances will be required to refund the said unrecouped amount. 
 

5. Receivables of P425,286.23 from concessionaires/tenants of canteen spaces 
remained outstanding as of December 31, 2020, thereby depriving the BatStateU’s 
Resource Generation Office (RGO) of additional funds for its income generating 
projects. Further, recorded balance of Operating Lease Receivable compared to 
RGO’s Aging Schedule showed a difference of P1,897.59 as of December 31, 2020. 

       
The reconciliation of accounts is a sound accounting procedure to ensure that two sets of 
records are in agreement and establish the validity and reliability of each account. 

  
Review of the Resource Generations Aging Schedule of Operating Lease Receivable and 
the semestral Status of Other Receivables as of December 31, 2020 showed that the 
following accounts of tenants are outstanding: 

 
As can be gleaned from the table above, receivables totaling P358,616.69 or 84.32% of 
the total receivables from tenants were already past due with age of two years to over 
eight years. Only the amount of P66,669.54 can be considered current accounts with age 
of 9 months.  
 
Inquiry with the RGO disclosed that they are sending demand letters to 
variousconcessionaires/tenants. In CY 2020, records showed that the RGO sent demand 
letters in January and July 2020. Five demand letters dated December 29, 2020 were sent 
in January 5, 2021. However, the receivables due from various tenants remained unsettled 
as of year-end.

The non-collection of receivables due from the lease of canteen spaces resulted in the 
tying up of funds in the hands of the lessees instead of being used by the RGO for its 
income generating projects. 

  
On the other hand, the year-end Operating Lease Receivable balance of P711,328.33in 
the Statement of Financial Position,P199,672.31 of which pertains to Main Campus, 
showed a difference of P1,897.59 as against the balance of the Main Campus RGO’s 
Schedule of Aging of Operating Lease Receivables of P201,569.90, thus understating the 
balance of Operating Lease Receivable as of year-end by the same amount. 

 
We recommended that the University President enjoin the: 

 
a) Resource Generation Office to intensify its collection efforts to ensure that 

receivables from various concessionaires are promptly realized for use in its 
income generating projects; 
 

b) the Accountant to determine the cause and nature of deficiency for the amount 
of P1,897.59 before effecting the adjustment through a Journal Entry Voucher 
(JEV). Consequently, conduct periodic reconciliation with the records of RGO 
to assure that the monthly GL and RGO balances are the same to properly 
present the correct balance of the Operating Lease Receivable in the year-end 
financial statement.  

 
Management’s Comments: 
 
The Director for Auxiliary Services commented that to ensure that receivables are 
promptly realized for use in its income generating projects, tenants were reminded through 
demand letters and phone calls. Majority of the tenants verbally requested to pay their 
balances upon resumption of canteen operations. Furthermore, the RGO had been 
exerting efforts to search the tenant’s location, their social media accounts and contacts 
numbers. 
 
The Accountant mentioned that the cause and nature of the difference between the 
Resource Generations Aging Schedule of Operating Lease Receivable and the year-end 
Operating Lease Receivable balance in the Statement of Financial position has been 
determined already and were adjusted in the books for the month of January 2021. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
  
The adjustment of P1,897.59 was verified  as recorded thru Journal Entry Voucher No. 
GJ-163 JEV No. 015. However, we maintain our recommendation since the adjustment 
was made after December 31, 2020. 
 

6. Disbursement transactions totaling P6,976,904.90 (net) were paid despite 
incomplete documentation and/or details, contrary to Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 
and COA Circular No. 2012-001, thereby casting doubts on the authenticity and 
validity of the transactions which may result to the issuance of Notice of 
Suspension to enforce submission of pertinent documents in accordance with the 
Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts. 

 



59 

  

Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 states that claims against government funds shall be 
supported with complete documentation.  In addition, COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated 
June 14, 2012 provides the revised guidelines and documentary requirements for common 
government transactions. 

 
Audit of transactions of BatStateU Jose P. Laurel Polytechnic College (JPLPC) and 
Apolinario R. Apacible School of Fisheries (ARASOF) showed that disbursements 
amounting to P6,976,904.90, net, for 55 DVs were not substantiated with the required 
documents, presented in detail in Annex F and summarized as follows: 

 
a) Salaries and allowances amounting to P5,779,738.62, net, paid to regular employees, 

Job Order (JO) personnel were lacking some documents required under Items 1.2.1 
and 4.1.3 of the above cited COA Circular, like: 

 
- No Daily Time Record (DTR) or when attached, there were times that signatures 

of the employee and/or the immediate supervisor were not affixed; and 
 

- Some were not supported with Accomplishment Report (AR) and there were 
instances that the AR was not signed by the personnel and/or the immediate 
supervisor. 
 

Items 1.2.1 and 4.1.3 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 both requires the payment for 
salaries, wages, allowances, honoraria and other similar expenses shall be supported 
with approved Daily Time Records (DTRs) or Certificate of Service and in case of 
payment of personnel under the “job order” status, duly verified/accepted 
accomplishment report. 

 
b) Other benefits of personnel consisting of Terminal Leave Benefits of P7,062.26 though 

supported with Clearance, the portion, “CERTIFICATION OF NO PENDING 
ADMINISTRATIVE CASE” was not properly filled up whether with pending 
administrative case or with ongoing investigation. Also, the photocopy of Employee's 
Leave Card was not authenticated; 

 
c) Honoraria amounting to P840,671.44 of faculty personnel were not supported with the 

necessary Daily Time Record (DTR) as required under Item 5.7.2 of the same COA 
circular. 
 
Item 5.7.2 of the same circular states that payment of honoraria to teaching personnel 
of DepEd, TESDA, SUCs and other educational institutions should also be supported 
with approved DTR/Service Report. 
 

d) Salary differentials amounting to P163,614.96 were not supported with the required 
Notice of Salary Adjustment (NOSA) and DTR during the period in violation of Item 
4.1.4 of the said circular. 
 
Item 4.1.4 of the above COA Circular enumerates the documentary requirements for 
salary differentials due to promotion and/or step increment which include the following: 

 
o Certified true copy of approved appointment in case of promotion or Notice 

of Salary Adjustment in case of step increment/salary increase, 
o Xxx 



60 

  

o Approved DTR or certification that the employee has not incurred leave 
without pay, 

o Xxx 
 

e) Procurement of office supplies and other inventory items totaling P122,596.86 showed 
the following deficiencies, in violation of Items 9.2 of the same COA Circular: 

 
- No proof of posting of Notice of Award on the PhilGEPS; 

 
- There was an instance that no copy of PR and Price Quotation was attached; 

 
- No Schedule of Distribution of items purchased; 

 
Item 9.2 of the same COA Circular provides the list of basic requirements common to 
all purchases through alternative modes, which include the following: 

 
- Proof of posting of Notice of Award in the PhilGEPS, xxx; 
- Inspection and Acceptance Report signed “Inspected by” by the authorized 

agency inspector and signed “Accepted by” by the authorized end-user to whom 
the item was delivered or the property officer if item is for stock. 

 
f) Claims for traveling expenses amounting to P15,445.00 were not supported with 

Certificate of Travel Completed and Certificate of Appearance while Itinerary of Travel 
not signed by the immediate supervisor certifying that travel is necessary to the 
service, period covered is reasonable and the expenses claimed are proper in violation 
of Item 1.2.4.1 of the same Circular; 
 

g) Other expenses totaling P10,900.00 were not supported with Official receipt or other 
proof of payment of membership fee to Laurelian Organization of BSU-JPLPC Malvar 
Campus Inc; and 
 

h) Payments for fuel consumption of service vehicles of P10,072.91 was not supported 
with properly accomplished Driver’s Trip Tickets.  In addition, the Driver's Trip Tickets 
were not in accordance with the format required under the Manual on Audit for Fuel 
Consumption of Government Motor Vehicles, thus necessary data were not stated. 

 
In addition, it was observed that the date of receipt of Purchase Orders (POs) were 
indicated using a “DATER” stamp instead of having it handwritten by the supplier or his 
authorized representative who made the actual receipt of the PO.  This was noted on the 
42 transactions totallingP1,963,172.74, net, presented in detail in Annex G.   
 
This practice casts doubt on the validity of the receipt of those POs, considering that the 
date of receipt of PO is very essential in determining whether or not delivery is within the 
period agreed by and between the supplier and the BatStateU-ARASOF which may result 
to imposition of penalty or liquidated damages. 
 
The above instances were not in accordance with Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 and various 
provisions under COA Circular No. 2012-001 as discussed above. 
 
We recommended that the Chancellors direct the Campus Accountant to stop the 
practice of processing claims without complete supporting documents and submit 



61 

  

the lacking documents as presented in Annex I, for further evaluation of the Audit 
Team.  Otherwise, a Notice of Suspension (NS) will be issued by the Audit Team in 
accordance with the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts. 

We also recommended that the Chancellors direct the Official/Employee involved 
in the issuance of POs to ensure its proper release by having it duly received and 
dated by the supplier. 

 
Management’s Comment: 
  
The Management of JPLPC-Malvar commented that they are doing their best to ensure 
transactions have complete documentations and will be stricter in processing payments 
for all claims and also ensure that the required documents have been in accordance with 
COA Circular No. 2012-001. The Accountant also submitted most of the lacking 
documents and also provided explanations for the other deficiencies noted. 

 
On the other hand, ARASOF-Nasugbu commented that the justifications submitted in 
response to some of the audit findings were considered by the audit team, however, 
supporting documents for seven transactions have not been submitted as of writing.  
Therefore, immediate submission of lacking documents is required to avoid audit 
suspension.  
 
As regards the implementation of handwritten acknowledgement by suppliers in the 
Purchase Orders, validation will be made in the audit of ensuing periods. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 
The Audit Team reiterates the submission of the remaining lacking documents and 
provision of satisfactory explanation relative to the said deficiency, for further evaluation, 
otherwise, Notice of Suspension (NS) will be issued by the Audit Team. 

 
7. Old prescribed style of uniforms which can no longer  be sold to students valued at 

P181,445.75 under Merchandise Inventory as well as damaged inventories valued 
at P22,421.59  have not been disposed of, thus, exposing these Inventory items to 
further physical deterioration, decline in economic value, and loss of opportunity 
to earn additional income had immediate disposal been effected through sale, in 
compliance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 89-296 dated 
January 27, 1989. Non-disposal also deprived the agency of the use of additional 
space inside the stockroom.  

 

Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides: 
 

“Destruction or sale of unserviceable property.  When government property has 
become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon 
application of the officer accountable therefor, be inspected by the head of the 
agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor 
concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in 
their presence.  If found to be valuable,  it may be sold at public auction  to the 
highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or 
similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized 
representative of the Commission, after advertising  by printed notice in the 



62 

  

Official Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper 
of general circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the 
expense of publication, by notices posted  for a like period in at  least three 
public places in the locality where the property is to be sold.  In the event that 
the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such price 
as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned and approved by 
the Commission.” 

 
Further, pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 89-296 dated January 27, 1989 provides 
the following: 

 
“IV. AUTHORITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROPERTY 
DISPOSAL/DIVESTMENT 

 
Pursuant to existing laws on the matter, the full and sole authority and 
responsibility for the divestment and disposal of property and other assets 
owned by national government agencies or instrumentalities, local government 
units and government-owned and/or controlled corporations and their 
subsidiaries shall be lodged in the heads of the departments, bureaus, and 
offices of the national government, the local government units, and the 
governing bodies or managing heads of government-owned or controlled 
corporations and their subsidiaries conformably to their respective corporate 
charters or articles of incorporation, who shall constitute the appropriate 
committee or body to undertake the same.” 

 
The Report on the Physical Count of Merchandise Inventories of JPLPC-Malvar as of

On the other hand, the Report on the Physical Count of Merchandise Inventory of 
ARASOF-Nasugbu as of December 31, 2020 submitted by the RGO reflected a total 
inventory quantity of 50,229.75with the following breakdown:

Other supplies 43,512 pcs. 

P.E  191 pcs. 

Souvenirs 559 pcs. 

      Total 50,229.75 

 
It was noted that included in the inventory of Uniforms of JPLPC-Malvar and ARASOF-
Nasugbu were 734 items consisted of old style/design uniforms occupying space in the 
stockroom and overstating the balance of the account by P181,445.75 (Annex H) 
 
On the other hand, review of Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs) of ARASOF-Nasugbu 
disclosed that out of the year-end inventory, 229 pieces were damaged with valuation of 
P22,421.59 (Annex I). 
 
Inquiry with the RGO Head, JPLPC-Malvar disclosed that old skirts with different sizes 
varying from sizes 16 and 18, and XL to 7XL were the old prescribed style of uniform of 
the Campus, thus cannot be sold anymore.  
 
Comparison of inventory reports (IR) as of December 31, 2020 with IR balances as of 
December 31, 2019 disclosed that said balances of old skirts remained the same, thus, 
no sale or disposal was made for the old prescribed style of uniform.  
 
The non-disposal of the said inventories could result to further physical deterioration and 
decline in economic value and loss of opportunity to earn additional income had immediate 
disposal been done through sale, in compliance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445.   
 
Furthermore, old design uniforms and damaged inventories amounting to P203,867.34 
were still included in the Merchandise Inventory account under the Inventory Held for Sale 
classification although these items could no longer be sold, thus overstating the 
recognized Merchandise Inventory account by the same amount. 
 
We recommended that the Chancellor direct the: 

 
a) Resource Generation Office to facilitate the disposal of the old design and 

damaged inventories with book value of P203,867.34 to prevent further 
deterioration of the assets and decongest the storage area, in compliance with 
Section 79 of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 89-296 dated January 27, 1989; 
and  

b) Accountant to ensure the derecognition of the obsolete inventories under 
Merchandise Inventory as Held for Sale after disposal.

Management’s Comment: 
 

The Management commented that the Accounting Office is in coordination with the RGO 
to facilitate disposal of the concerned items and derecognize it in the books. 

 
In addition, the Resource Generation Office has the following options for the disposal of 
said merchandise items: 

 

 RGO will seek the assistance of the upholstery shops to recycle or convert the old 
prescribed skirt uniforms into new items such as padding for chairs, car seats, and 
industrial blankets, 
 

 RGO will look for tailors or dressmakers who could make the old merchandise saleable 
items such as string bags, shoulder bags, dust covers for computers, and pencil cases, 
aprons that might be sold to parents, students, faculty, employees, and 
 

 The merchandise may be converted into bed covers, pillow cases and covers, table 
cloths, and curtains to be sold to schools, offices, restaurants, coffee and tea shops, 
lodging-inns, and computer shops. 
 

The abovementioned activities are deemed feasible to prevent further deterioration of the 
assets and decongest the storage.  Reports will be made available and will be properly 
communicated with JPLPC Accountant who will ensure the proper classification of all 
items under Merchandise Inventory as Held for Sale Items and will present fairly the true 
balance of the said account 

 
On the other hand, the ARASOF-Nasugbu also mentioned that the Office of the Vice 
President for Development and External Affairs conceptualized a plan to up cycle 
damaged/ obsolete items. 
 
Moreover, the Vice President for Administration and Finance mentioned in the exit 
conference that disposal will be made and corresponding adjusting entries in the books 
would be effected to derecognize the old style uniforms and damaged inventories.  

 
Gender and Development 

8. Only P8,140,000.00 or 0.48% of the BatStateU budget for CY 2020 amounting 
P1,707,795,000.00 was allotted for Gender and Development (GAD) activities, 
contrary to Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) – National Economic 
Development Authority (NEDA) – Department of Budget and Management (DBM) 
Joint Circular No. 2012-01, thus depriving the organization and its clients the 
programs that tends to increase gender awareness and responsiveness. 

 
Item 6.1 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01, provides: 
 

“At least five percent (5%) of the total agency budget appropriations 
authorized under the annual GAA shall correspond to activities supporting 
GAD plans and programs. The GAD budget shall be drawn from the agency’s 
maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOE), capital outlay (CO), 



65 

  

and personal services (PS). It is understood that the GAD budget does not 
constitute an additional budget over an agency’s total budget appropriations. 

 
Further, Item 6.4 of the same Joint Circular states that, “Attribution to the GAD budget of 
a portion or the whole of the budget of an agency’s major program is a means toward 
gradually increasing the gender responsiveness of government programs and budget.” 

 
Verification of the submitted GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) of the BatStateU for CY 2020 
revealed that the amount attributed for GAD related activities do not correspond to the five 
per cent requirement, summarized as follows: 

 
Required 5% 
GAD Budget 

BatStateU 
GAD Budget 

Percentage of 
BatStateU’s 

GAD Budget to 
Annual Budget 

Difference 

Annual Budget (GAA) 
(P1,707,795,000.00 x 5%) P85,389,750.00 P8,140,000.00 0.48% P77,249,750.00 
     

This practice is contrary to the aforementioned provisions of Joint Circular No. 2012-01 of 
PCW-NEDA-DBM, thus depriving the organization and its clients the programs that tends 
to increase gender responsiveness. 
 
We recommended that the University President enjoin the Director of Extension 
Services to attribute to the GAD budget a portion or the whole of the budget of the 
BatStateU’s major programs to increase gender responsiveness, in compliance 
with paragraph 6.4 of Joint Circular No. 2012-01 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM. 

 
Management’s Comments: 
 
The Management acknowledged the observation that the University’s 2020 GAD Plan and 
Budget was below the minimum five percent allocation for GAD activities. Nevertheless, 
the Management stated that the client-focused and organization-focused activities 
indicated in the said GPB are intended to address the need for implementing gender 
responsive projects and activities. It was, however, unfortunate that the pandemic 
hampered the intensive implementation of the projects and activities of the University to 
fully address the gender needs of its clients and stakeholders. 

Despite the difficulties encountered in the implementation of GAD PPAs in CY 2020, the 
2021 GAD Plan and Budget of the University includes an attributable program which was 
assessed using the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines, to comply with the 
appropriation/attribution of at least five percent of the University’s budget to GAD PPAs. 
Assessment of said program revealed that it was gender sensitive, hence, 55.85% of the 
budget indentified for the program was attributed to GAD, based on the new attribution 
formula (PCW MC 2019-02). Through this attribution, the University’s 2021 GPB 
corresponds to 6.20% of the GAD budget of the University. This will contribute towards 
gradually increasing the gender responsiveness of the University’s programs and budget. 
The 2021 GPB of the University has been submitted to CHED IV-A, and thereafter 
endorsed to PCW for review. As of this date, the PCW is yet to forward the endorsed copy 
of the 2021 GPB since it is still under their review.

9. Various GAD planned programs, activities and projects (PAPs) for CY 2020 could 
not be implemented by the BatStateU due to pandemic but still the BatStateU’s GAD 
Focal Point did not opt to revise the University’s GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for 
CY 2020 as provided in the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) Memorandum 
Circular (MC) No. 2020-03,  thus the gender issues and activities identified therein 
may not have addresses the actual issues and concerns arising from the unequal 
status of men and women stakeholders due to the COVID-19 situation. 

 
The PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2020-03 dated April 27, 2020 was issued to provide 
guidance on the revision and/or implementation of the FY 2020 GPB to implement GAD 
PAPs that address gender issues and concerns related to the COVID-19 situation. 
Pertinent provisions are as follows: 
 

“4.1. All national government agencies and instrumentalities are enjoined to 
review and revise, as necessary, their FY 2020 Gender and Development 
(GAD) Plan and Budget (GPB) to implement measures to address gender 
issues and concerns arising from the unequal status of their women and men 
stakeholders due to the COVID-19 situation. Such measures should be in 
line with their respective agency mandates, Republic Act No. 9710 or the 
Magna Carta of Women and the Bayanihan to Heal As One Act. … 

 
4.2 The revision of the FY 2020 GPB should also be in line with the 
parameters set under National Budget Circular No. 580. GAD PAPs that fall 
under Section 4.3.1 of said policy shall be discontinued.” 

 
Relatively, National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 580 on the adoption of economy measures 
in the government due to the emergency health situation dated April 22, 2021 states: 
 

“4.3.1 Discontinuance of the following: 
  
4.3.1.4  All local travels, unless urgently necessary and allowed by the  

Secretary or head of the SUCs, constitutional offices and 
GOCCs; 

 
4.3.1.5 Conduct of celebrations and cultural or sports activities not 

related to the core function of the agency, including athletic 
competitions conducted by public schools or SUCs; xx” 

 
Based on the CY 2020 GPB, the BatStateU planned to mainstream in its budget the 
amount of P8,140,000.00 which is 0.48% of its proposed budget for the same year to 
address 35 gender issues/GAD mandates through various GAD activities.  
 
Among the planned activities in the GPB, we noted that the conduct of activities in 
connection with the celebration of Women’s Month and the conduct of 
seminars/trainings/workshops/campaigns in various barangays, which involves local 
travels, fall under the list of “for discontinuance” projects/activities cited above.  
 
Due to the above NBC Circular, the said activities were not implementable during the year, 
hence, it was necessary to revise them to include other gender issues and activities that 
were expected to arise during the COVID-19 pandemic. Revised GPB was due for 



67 

  

submission on July 1, 2020 for re-endorsement of PCW, however none was submitted by 
the BatStateU’s GAD Focal Point. 
 
Inquiry with the GAD Secretariat disclosed that they were not informed/advised to prepare 
a revised GPB. 
 
On the other hand, other activities identified in the GPB, although not included in the items 
“for discontinuance” could have been considered beforehand as non-implementable within 
the year, thus should have been subjected to revision, consisting of activities like 
trainings/orientations/community activities, livelihood-related activities and other 
extension services activities. 
 
Verification of the GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) provided by the Extension Office 
disclosed that out of the 35 gender issues indicated in the GPB, seven were implemented, 
four were partially implemented and 24 were not implemented. 
 
The BatStateU only included in the AR the conduct of webinars on parent engagement, 
labor standards and mental health awareness during the pandemic. Other than the said 
webinars which were incorporated in one of their planned gender responsive PAPs 
activities already included in the GPB, no other gender issues during the  pandemic were 
addressed that were added in the GAD AR which could have been their other option, that 
is “to reflect all changes made in the original FY 2020 GPB in their GAD Accomplishment 
Report”, since they opted not to revise the GPB. 

 
As a result of the non-revision of the GPB, the gender issues they intended to resolve may 
not have been addressed, while additional gender issues and concerns brought about by 
the COVID 19 situation and the means of addressing them were not included therein.  
 
We recommended that the University President enjoin the Director of Extension 
Services to comply with GAD-related regulations in the preparation or revision of 
GPBs in order to properly address pressing gender issues and concerns during the 
pandemic. 
 
Management’s Comments: 
 

The Management acknowledged the observation of the Audit Team that the 2020 GPB 
was not revised based on PCW MC no. 2020-03. Nevertheless, the Management stated 
that at the beginning of the enhanced community quarantine implemented in March 2020, 
the Extension Service Office has designed plans on how to implement the activities under 
the new normal, despite the non-revision of the 2020 GPB. Varied webinars were 
conducted in order to provide the project implementers with the capability of conducting 
PPAs despite the limitations due to the pandemic and health protocols that are being 
observed. These webinars focused initially on exploring alternatives modes of delivering 
extension and GAD PPAs. Through these webinars, the projects implementers were able 
to conduct PPAs despite the challenges posed by the new normal. The PPAs implemented 
were able to address the needs of the clients ranging from awareness to consciousness-
raising to capability building activities and livelihood trainings, using varied online 
platforms. These PPAs addressed the needs of the clients brought about by the COVID-
19 pandemic. Due to this alternative mode of service delivery and project implementation, 
the budget utilization was affected since most of the implemented PPAs did not incur 
expenses. 



68 

  

With regards to the GAD AR, the Management mentioned that it was still a draft prepared 
by the GAD Focal Point Person which was forwarded to the Gender Mainstreaming 
Monitoring System (GMMS) of the PCW. The draft was forwarded to CHED IV-A, and 
thereafter, endorsed to PCW. There are still indicators in the GAD AR which are yet to be 
included in the final draft of the said AR. As of this date, the PCW Reviewer has forwarded 
the draft to the GAD Focal Point Person, with general comments on the entries in the 
document. It will not be considered final until the PCW has finished reviewing the 2020 
GAD AR. 

Due to the difficulties brought about by the pandemic in the implementation of GAD PPAs, 
the 2021 GAD Plan and Budget of the University was designed to properly address the 
pressing gender issues and concerns in the time of the pandemic. In addition, the 
unimplemented and partially-implemented activities included in the 2020 GPB have been 
included in the 2021 GPB in order to be implemented, thereby addressing further the 
gender needs of the clients and organization. Said 2021 GPB is yet to be endorsed by the 
PCW since its current status is “under review”. The GAD Focal Point Person is awaiting 
the PCW reviewer’s return of the document to verify if there are comments on whether or 
not there is need to revise entries in the 2021 GPB. 
 
Due to Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) 
 
BatStateU has remitted the amount of P62,227,527.76 representing premium 
contributions on Life and Retirement equivalent to nine percent of the monthly 
compensation of employees and 12percentgovernment share. The balance of this

The Due to NGAs balance 
of P124,519,776.01 of the 
BatStateU Main included 
unliquidated and non-
moving accounts amounting 
to P41,913,310.84 and 
P810,664.34 balance for 10 
completed projects which 
were not returned to the

COA Circular No. 94-013 
and Section 63, Chapter 6 
of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) 
for National Government 
Agencies (NGAs), Volume I.  
This does not only deprives 
the national government of 
funds for its operation but 
also affects the fair 
presentation of accounts in 
the Financial Statements.  
In addition, there were 
differences of 
P9,039,312.13 between the 
confirmed balances of the 
SAs and the BatStateU’s 

We reiterated our 
recommendations that the 
BatStateU President: 
 
a) advise the concerned 

staff in the Scholarship 
and Financial 
Assistance and 
Research, Extension 
and Development 
Services to fast track 
the retrieval of the 
documents necessary 
for the adjustment of 
P41,913,310.84 which 
has been long 
outstanding; 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
The unexpended 
amount of P10,865.00 
and P374.83 were 
returned to Source

hand, the Assistant 
Director of Scholarship

designs and clothing 
materials, as requested 
by the students through 
Office of Student Affairs

and not because of 
incorrect pattern, design 
and textiles. However, 
she added, that in a 
remote instance, skirts 
under those obsolete 
items are still being 
purchased during 2017. 
Relative to this, the

The Management

factual observation of 
this matter that the 
approval of the HoPE 
on the recommendation 
of the BAC of an award 
shall be within 15 days 
from the date of the 
recommendation, and

However, the Board of 
Regents, which is for 
purposes of bidding 
acting as HoPE, 
conducts its regular 
meeting once every 
quarter. Although BAC 
diligently endeavours to 
observe the periods of 
the conduct of its 
activities, the regular 
meetings of the Board 
do not coincide with the 
period prescribed for the 
approval of awards, and 
BAC cannot compel the 
Board to hold special 
meetings to act on the 
awards of the projects. 
BAC prepares the 
necessary documents, 
including the resolutions 
of awards of projects, to

The Management 
commented that the 
Audit Team has a 
factual observation of 
the delay in the 
execution of the 
contract. It should be 
noted, however, that 
contract signing is an 
act that involves 
judgment or discretion 
and the act to enter or 
not into a contract is 
incumbent on the 
parties. Thus, a party to 
the bidding process, for 
instance – the procuring 
entity, cannot compel 
the other to sign 
although there are rules 
on bidding that specify 
periods to do so.

Considering that the 
contracting parties are 
given generally the 
opportunity to review 
the contract, the bidders 
must have ample time 
to review the purchase 
agreement which, in this 
case, involves the 
delivery of books. The 
documents pertaining to 
the books were complex 
and the details were 
complicated. The review 
of these details might 
have taken some time. 
The University 
recognizes the period 
set in the procurement 
law and its IRR. 
However, there are 
cases that require 
diligence to be 
observed, thus delay 
caused by performance 
in good faith of such 
diligence should be 
considered justified. To 
prevent delays in future 
transactions of this 
nature, BAC shall adopt

there are books

common practice in the 
industry that foreign 
publishers have local 
distributors. The Auditor

b) Discrepancy ranging 
from 2 to 191.88 and

We recommended that 
the BatStateU President 
and JPLPC/ARASOF 
Executive Directors: 

 
a) enjoin their respective

d) Excess of days

As to the issue on 
allowing 13 personnel to

accumulation of VL of 
less than 15 days, the 
said personnel actually

and condition of the 
Contract of Lease 
particularly on the 
imposition of 5% penalty on 
overdue accounts, granting 
of 30% and 50% discounts 
and issuance of demand 
and termination letters 
resulted in the continual 
delayed payments ranging 
from 2 to 693 days and non-
collection of overdue 
accounts and penalties 
totalingP557,048.64. 
 

We recommended that 
the BatStateU President 
thru the Executive 
Director enjoin the Head 
of RGO to strictly enforce 
the immediate collection 
of overdue accounts of

Implementation of Student 
Financial Assistance 
Programs, particularly on 
the selection and approval

totalingP451,500.00, thus 

We recommended that 
the BatStateU President 
make representations with 
the Regional Director 
CHEDRO IV-A regarding 
approval of grants to 
unqualified grantees.    
 
 

The Management 
commented that 28

were reassessed and 
determined to be 
qualified.   There were 
also two duplicate
