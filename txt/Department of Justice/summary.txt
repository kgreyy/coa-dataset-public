(Observation No. 1)



We recommended that the Accounting Division (AD) account for reconciling items and prepare Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to take up the adjustment on the affected accounts in the financial statements. 



2)	The accuracy and existence of the balance of inter-agency receivables totaling ₱338,262,030.49 consisting of receivables from national government agencies, government owned and/or controlled corporations and local government units cannot be ascertained due to unreconciled difference of ₱15,737,117.18 between the book balance and the confirmed balance of fund transfer by the Implementing Agencies (IAs).  Moreover, it also includes long outstanding fund transfers totaling ₱35,754,492.80 aged from five to 20 years due to failure of the IAs to liquidate the same contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013 and COA Circular No. 2016-005. (Observation No. 2)



We recommended that Management: a) require the Accounting Division to coordinate and reconcile their book balances with the IAs and effect necessary adjustments, if any; b) make a strong representation with the IAs for immediate liquidation of long outstanding balances; and c) request for authority to write-off dormant balances of fund transfers following the procedures prescribed under COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



3)	The existence and accuracy of the Inventory accounts balances totaling ₱33,323,310.78 as at year-end cannot be ascertained due to discrepancy of ₱21,529,268.16 between the balances per accounting records and per actual inventory report for Office Supplies Inventory and semi-expendable items caused by delayed submission of Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) and Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) by the Regional Offices to the Head Office.
