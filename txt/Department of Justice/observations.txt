Audit of Cash in Bank (CIB)-LCCA account



1)	The balance of the Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account amounting to ₱114,136,047.18 as of December 31, 2020 was misstated by ₱18,893,138.73 due to unrecorded/unadjusted reconciling items, contrary to Section 6, Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I.

	2)	It was noted that Account No. 0592-1022-42 – DOJ - Victims Compensation Fund (VCF) reported a book balance of ₱5,365.00 even if said account was closed in August 2019, therefore necessitating adjustment. Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) for VCF for the month of August 2019 was not submitted to the Office of the Auditor to validate deposits and withdrawals made to the account. 



	3)	On the other hand, reconciling items identified in the BRS for Account No. 0592-1060-51 – DOJ ATM Payroll, remained unadjusted in the books as of December 31, 2020, to wit:

	4)	Section 6, Chapter 21 of GAM Volume I, provides for: Recognition of Adjustments.  The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall prepare a JEV to recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the books of accounts.



	5)	It is also worthy to disclose that there are bank reconciling items that affect the balance of Account No. 0592-1060-51 – DOJ ATM Payroll Account, specifically deposits-in-transit totaling ₱131,307,278.97, representing various transfers of funds for different payments to officials and employees, prosecutors and staffs, separated employees, and job order personnel.    



	6)	As defined under Section 2(g), Chapter 21 of GAM Volume I, Deposits-in-Transit – are amounts of agency/entity deposits in the bank but which are yet to be recorded by the bank until the next period.  These usually pertain to late deposits in the last day of business for a period. (Underscoring ours for emphasis)



	7)	The aforementioned bank reconciling items was recorded by the bank in January 2021.



	8)	The unadjusted balance of closed account and the unrecorded book and bank reconciling items resulted in the misstatement of the Cash in Bank –Local Currency Current Account and other affected accounts in the financial statements as follows:

	9)	We recommended that the Accounting Division (AD) account for reconciling items and prepare JEV to take up the adjustment on the affected accounts in the financial statements. 



Management Comments



	10)	Management commented that the reconciling item/s under DOJ VCF were erroneous entries which were reversed under JEV Nos. JEV-2021-02-00008 to JEV-2021-02-00014.



	11)	Accordingly, they are awaiting details from the Payroll Division (with Memorandum dated 20 January 2021), as to the reconciling items affecting the DOJ ATM Payroll Account.





Audit of Due from NGAs, Due from GOCCs and Due from LGUs Accounts



2)	The accuracy and existence of the balance of inter-agency receivables totaling ₱338,262,030.49 consisting of receivables from national government agencies, government owned and/ or controlled corporations and local government units cannot be ascertained due to unreconciled difference of ₱15,737,117.18 between the book balance and the confirmed balance of fund transfer by the Implementing Agencies. Moreover, it also includes long outstanding fund transfers totaling ₱35,754,492.80 aged from five to 20 years due to failure of the IAs to liquidate the same contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013 and COA Circular No. 2016-005.



Unreconciled Balances



	1)	Paragraph 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated 13 December 1994, Rules and Regulations in the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of Funds Transferred to IAs, provides that: Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds.  Only actual project expenses shall be reported.  The reports shall be approved by the Head of the IA.   



	2)	Further, Paragraph 4.9 of the same Circular states that:  The IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion of the project.



	3)	Likewise, COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 sets forth the guidelines and procedures on the reconciling and cleaning books of accounts of NGAs, LGUs and GOCCs from dormant receivable, unliquidated CAs and fund transfers, for fair presentation of the Financial Statements (FS).



	4)	Pertinent provisions of which are as follows:



Section 5.6 defines, Dormant Unliquidated Fund Transfers as advances granted by the source agency to implementing entity for the implementation of programs/projects which remained non-moving for ten (10) years or more and where settlement could no longer be ascertained.



Section 7.1 mandates the accountant to:  Conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis and validation of the existence of receivables, unliquidated cash advances and fund transfers and determine the concerned debtors, accountable officers (Regular and Special Disbursing Officers, Collecting Officers, Cashiers) and the source and implementing government agencies concerned.



Section 7.2 requires the Accountant to: Reconcile the unliquidated fund transfers between the source and implementing government entities, prepare the adjusting entries for the reconciling items noted, and require liquidation of the balances.



 Section 8.2 provides that:  the Head of the government entity shall   file   the   request   for   authority   to   write-off   dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers to the COA Audit Team Leader and/or Supervising Auditor.  No filing fee is required.



	5)	Inter-agency receivables  have an aggregate balance of ₱338,262,030.49 as at year-end consisting of Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs), Due from Government Owned or Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) and Due from Local Government Units (LGUs)  as shown below:

	6)	In the audit of said accounts, 14 confirmation letters were sent to IAs to determine the reliability and existence of the ending balances as recorded in the books of DOJ. Of the 14 confirmation letters sent, only three IAs replied showing a variance of ₱15,737,117.18.

	7)	As can be gleaned from above table, confirmation reply of PS revealed a discrepancy of ₱15,696,116.73 against the DOJ book balance. The negative balance of ₱3,635,620.31 in PS books showed a grossly unreconciled account between the two records.



	8)	Efforts were exerted by the Audit Team to secure copy of the Departments’ reconciliation statements on this account, but to no avail. Inquiry with the Accounting Division revealed that timely reconciliation with PS was not made. Accordingly, the difference could be attributed to the following:



a)	Failure of the ROs to submit Delivery Receipts (DRs) on time; hence, the reason for delayed recording and recognition of asset and expenses;



b)	Airline tickets purchased through PS-DBM were not timely forwarded to the Accounting Division. For the current year, airline tickets procured during the 1st quarter were not appropriately charged to the account Due from NGAs, PS-DBM, consequently adding to the discrepancy between the two accounts; and



c)	There were unrecorded payments by the Department ROs in the PS-DBM books by PS; thus, resulting in negative balances appearing in the books of PS-DBM. 

 

	9)	These deficiencies were already raised in prior years’ audit observation but were not acted upon by Management. 



	10)	On the other hand, the balance of the Due from GOCCs account of ₱281,287.69 tagged as “For Recon” in the books has been existing even prior to December 2014 upon migration of data in the eNGAs. It is informed that the Accounting Division has no records to support these balances. Accordingly, they inherited these deficiencies from their predecessor. Considering the time that has elapsed, adjustment on the account should have been made by Management.  



	11)	As regards the Due from LGUs account, no records were found to support the account balance. Verification revealed that these balances of fund transfers to LGUs were merely forwarded balance from the old version of the eNGAs during the December 2014 migration of data. Consequently, out of the six confirmation letters sent to IAs, only two replied with zero balance; thus, negating the balance recorded in the DOJ books. Moreover, it is informed in the reply of the LGU (New Bataan) that the balance appearing in the DOJ’s records was refunded and deposited to the account of the BTr. Had regular reconciliation of records and proper coordination with the IAs been made, existence of long outstanding accounts could have been eliminated and adjusted accordingly. As to the confirmation letters sent through email on December 11 and 16, 2020 to the Resident Auditor of the four LGUs, their replies have yet to be received as to date. 



	12)	The presence of these discrepancies between the balances per DOJ books and the IAs and the balance subject to reconciliation casted doubt on the accuracy and existence of the balances of inter-agency receivables.



	13)	We recommended that Management require the Accounting Division to coordinate and reconcile their book balances with the IAs and effect necessary adjustments, if any.



Management Comments



	14)	Management has continuously issued several demand letters to the concerned IAs requiring to immediately settle existing obligations to DOJ.  However, despite several demands, the concerned IAs failed to heed the requests.  It can be inferred that the setback for the non-settlement of the existing inter-agency receivables springs from the concerned IAs, to the prejudice of the DOJ.



	15)	The following JEVs were made to record the liquidation of various Due from NGAs balances:



a)	DPWH – Ifugao 

JEV 2020-12-009654 - ₱5,000,000.00

b)	University of the Philippines

JEV 2020-12-009102 - ₱8,000,000.00

c)	DOLE – Office of the Secretary

JEV 2020-01-000647 - ₱412,081.50



	16)	During the exit conference, the Chief Accountant commented that DOJ’s procurement through PS-DBM is semi-centralized due to payments being made by the Head Office to the regional Procurement Office while items procured were delivered directly to the ROs.  Due to COVID 19 pandemic, ROs have difficulties in submitting Delivery Receipts (DRs) to the DOJ Head Office.



	17)	Accordingly, Management will be sending out letters to ROs and prompt them to submit the needed DRs.









Long outstanding balance of ₱35,754,492.80 or 10.57 percent aged five to more than 20 years



	18)	Analysis of balances disclosed that about 10.57 percent of inter-agency receivables of ₱338,262,030.49 or ₱35,642,687.28, are long outstanding or unsettled accounts aging from five to 20 years, details are as follows:

	19)	Despite Management’s demand to settle the unutilized fund transfers or fund balances, the concerned IAs failed to fully liquidate the same. It was noted in the submitted Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation (AAPSI) that the DOJ Undersecretary for Financial Management issued various demand letters to IAs requiring the immediate liquidation of long outstanding funds transferred.  However, no copies of replies to the demand letters were provided to the Audit Team for reference purposes.  



	20)	We recommended that Management:



a)	make a strong representation with the IAs for immediate liquidation of long outstanding balances; and



b)	request for authority to write-off dormant balances of fund transfers following the procedures prescribed under COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



	21)	Management persisted in sending demand letters to concerned IAs to remind and require them to settle outstanding obligations to DOJ.



a)	Demand letter and request for meeting was sent anew to DICT on February 11, 2021;



b)	Demand letter was sent anew to RD Wilfredo S. Mallari of the DPWH – Romblon District Engineering Office (DEO); and



c)	Reconciliation with PS-DBM and NPO is on-going.



	22)	On September 23, 2020, Management requested authority to write-off dormant receivables/unliquidated fund transfers.  However, in the Memorandum dated October 19, 2020, COA required the submission of additional documents in compliance to COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



	23)	The Chief Accountant commented during the exit conference that they are having difficulty in obtaining liquidation reports from the concerned IAs and compliance is through IAs end.





Audit of Inventories Accounts



3)	The existence and accuracy of the Inventory accounts balances totaling ₱33,323,310.78 as at year-end cannot be ascertained due to discrepancy of ₱21,529,268.16 between the balances per accounting records and per actual inventory report for Office Supplies Inventory and semi-expendable items caused by delayed submission of Requisition and Issue Slip and Inventory Custodian Slip by the Regional Offices to the Head Office.



	1)	Section 9 Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I, prescribes the use of perpetual inventory system.  Whereas, the system requires accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the maintenance of the Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs) by the Accounting Division or Accounting Unit and Stock Card (SC) by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock. Regular purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for supplies and materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense accounts. 



	2)	Section 17 Chapter 8 of the same manual prescribes the following records, forms and reports to be prepared and/or maintained for inventories:



a)	Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) – shall be used to record all receipts and issues of supplies and the balance in quantity at any time.  It shall be maintained by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit for each item in stock.



b)	Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) (Appendix 57) – shall be used to record materials received, issued and the balance both in quantity and amount at any time. It shall be maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit for each kind of supplies and materials. 



c)	Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) (Appendix 63) – shall be used by the end-user to request issue of supplies and materials that are carried on stock.  It is also used by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit to indicate availability or non-availability of items requisitioned and/or to record issues of item/s requisitioned. 



d)	Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) (Appendix 64) – shall be prepared by the Property and/or Supply Custodian based on the RIS and shall be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the JEV to record the supplies and materials issued. 



e)	Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) (Appendix 66) – shall be used to report the physical count of supplies by type of inventory as at a given date.  It shows the balance of inventory items per card and per count and shortage/overage, if any.







As of December 31, 2020, the inventory accounts posted an aggregate balance of ₱33,323,310.78 consisting of the following:

Moreover, it should be noted in the above table that the details as to the description of inventory items are lacking while the unit price of the items procured is somehow costly. 

b)	Variance between balance per books and balance per actual physical count of Semi-Expendable assets 



	7)	Semi-expendable accounts per accounting books disclosed an aggregated balance of ₱20,998,404.34 while the balance per actual physical count of these assets amounted to ₱1,679,231.56 or a variance of ₱19,319,172.78. Details are presented below:

	8)	The discrepancy could be attributed to delayed submission of Inventory Custodian Slip from the ROs to record the issuance of semi-expandable items to end-users.



c)	Incomplete submission of RPCI



	9)	Paragraph A, Appendix 66 of GAM Vol. II provides that:  The RPCI shall be prepared semi-annually by the Inventory Committee and by Fund Cluster. Further, Paragraph E of the same appendix states that:  The report shall be submitted to COA Auditor concerned not later than July 31 and January 31 of each year for the first and second semesters, respectively.



	10)	It was noted that Management submitted complete RPCI as of December 31, 2020 for the six inventory accounts, namely:



a)	Office Supplies Inventory

b)	Semi-Expendable Machinery

c)	Semi-Expendable Office Equipment

d)	Semi-Expendable Information and Communication Equipment

e)	Semi-Expendable Communications Equipment

f)	Semi-Expendable Furniture and Fixture.



	11)	The RPCI for Accountable Forms Plates and Stickers Inventory and Semi-Expendable Books were incomplete while the RPCI for Office Supplies and Materials Inventory has no supporting documents.





	12)	We recommended that Management direct the:



a)	Accounting Division to conduct periodic reconciliation of records with the Property Management Section and make necessary adjustments if warranted; and



b)	Property Management Section to submit a complete set of RPCI for all inventory accounts.

	13)	The Accounting Division, in cooperation with the PMS, continuously conducts reconciliation of the inventory accounts.  Out of the noted ₱2,210,095.38 variance between the records of AD and PMS for Office Supplies Inventory, only ₱27,691.90 is currently being reconciled by concerned offices.  Meanwhile, corresponding adjustment/s pertaining to Other ICT Supplies Inventory aggregating ₱399,492.26 will be made immediately once the RIS are submitted and received by the AD from the PMS or end-users.



	14)	The variance of ₱19,319,172.78 between the balances of the account in the financial statements and actual physical count of semi-expendable assets was caused by belated submission of the ICS by the ROs. The ROs are authorized to procure their operational requirements directly from the regional depots of PS-DBM.  Such regional procurement is being handled by the concerned ROs.  



	15)	To address the noted variance and related issues on the Inventory of office supplies, materials and other assets, Management has recently released Department Order No. 070 dated 29 March 2021 prescribing the duties and responsibilities of all designated property/supply custodians in the Department.  



	16)	The recent adjustments made by the Accounting Division pertaining to semi-expendable items are JEV Nos. 2021-02-000663, 2021-2021-02-000664, 2021-02-000665 and 2021-02-000666 all dated February 1, 2021 amounting to ₱127,928.32, ₱284,128.76, ₱12,647.00 and ₱426,880.00, respectively. 



	17)	Also, Management directed the PMS to draft a memorandum requiring all custodians, particularly those assigned in the ROs to effectively manage the issuance of ICS, to enable the AD to make the necessary entries for semi-expendable items.









Audit of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) Accounts



4)	The accuracy and existence of the PPE accounts balances totaling ₱1,239,378,837.55 cannot be relied upon due to: a) discrepancy of ₱506,774,284.45 between the balance per books and per RPCPPEs for seven PPE accounts; b) inclusion in the Building account of completed Hall of Justice Buildings valued at ₱9,977,438.51 constructed for the Supreme Court of the Philippines; c) non-reclassification to the Buildings account of completed Justice Center amounting to ₱46,775,426.78.  Moreover, various deficiencies were noted in the verification of the Regional RPCPPE and PPE located in regional, provincial and city prosecution offices of the Department.

	4)	Based on the above table, out of the 14 PPE accounts, only 12 accounts were included in the RPCPPE of DOJ Main, NCR and ROs while the other two were without RPCPPE. The two PPE accounts without RPCPPE have book balance of ₱136,033,374.84 or 10.98 percent of the aggregate PPE balance. On the other hand, the difference of ₱506,774,284.45 between the balance per books and balance per RPCPPE is still subject to verification by PMS.



	5)	Our verification of the RPCPPE showed the following deficiencies:



a)	No consolidated RPCPPE for DOJ;

	10)	The non-disposal unserviceable properties exposes the same to further damage, deterioration and decrease in economic value.



	11)	We recommended that Management:



a)	submit a complete and consolidated RPCPPE for DOJ;



b)	reclassify the 104 units of semi-expendable properties recorded as PPE to the appropriate account;

c)	determine the unit value of 169 units of donated/transferred and procured PPEs and adjust the balance of PPE accounts accordingly;



d)	prepare the IIRUP for 420 units of unserviceable PPEs and promptly dispose the same in a manner/mode most advantageous to DOJ; and



e)	require the Accounting Division and the Property Management Section to conduct regular and thorough reconciliation of records for PPE. 

	

	Management Comments

	

	12)	The Management commented that they constantly direct the heads of services/offices, particularly the heads of regional prosecution offices, regarding the conduct of annual actual physical count of PPE, as well as the preparation of RPCPPE.  .



	13)	On January 31, 2020, the Undersecretary for Financial Management directed all heads of services/programs/project to designate at least one (1) property custodian from their respective offices for the monitoring, control and recording of all property acquired, issued or disposed. 



	14)	Recently, the DOJ  Secretary issued Department Order No. 070 dated March 29, 2021, prescribing the duties and responsibilities of property/supply custodians, which includes the duty of preparing inventory reports, among others, but despite such directives, some of the property/supply custodians failed to submit their RPCPPEs’ on time for lack of personnel complement and heavy caseload of prosecutors.



	15)	Likewise, the AD made the necessary adjustment of ICT Equipment under JEV No. 2021-03-001407 dated March 1, 2021.  With regard to Office Equipment and Furniture and Fixtures, the AD is currently reviewing the composition of the affected accounts and necessary adjustment accordingly.



	16)	Moreover, the 169 units of donated/transferred and procured PPEs, Management hired two Job Order personnel to assist the PMS in the preparation of consolidated RPCPPE.



	17)	On the other hand, the DOJ Disposal Committee had already disposed of unserviceable equipment, including vehicles amounting to ₱79,726,724.81.







Completed Halls of Justice (HOJ) building projects still included in the Buildings account

	19)	As shown in the above table, the completed HOJ building projects from Regions III and VI amounting to ₱3,844,942.55 and ₱6,132,495.96, respectively, are still recorded in the Buildings account of the Department.  These buildings are 100 percent completed and should have been transferred to the Supreme Court of the Philippines pursuant to Section 1 (A) Article 1 of the MOA executed on June 9, 2000 by and between the DOJ and SCP, which states that:



	The ownership of all the BUILDINGS that have been completely constructed under the JUSIP, including the land on which the BUILDINGS have been constructed and the improvements thereon, as well as all furniture and office equipment provided or issued by the DEPARTMENT to the courts and court personnel in said BUILDINGS, shall automatically be transferred to the COURT upon the signing of this MOA.



	20)	The inclusion of the HOJ buildings in the Buildings account of the DOJ resulted in the overstatement of said account by ₱9,977,438.51 and the understatement of the related accounts in the financial statements.



	21)	We recommended that Management cause the immediate transfer of the completed HOJ Buildings of Regions III and VI to the SCP in compliance with the MOA and prepare the necessary adjustment in the books of accounts.  



         Completed Justice Center not reclassified to the Buildings account 



	22)	Chapter 10, Section 8 (g) of the GAM, Vol. I which states that: During the construction period, all expenses incurred in relation to the construction of PPE shall be taken up in the books as Construction in Progress (CIP) with the appropriate asset classification.  As soon as the construction is completed, the CIP account shall be reclassified to the proper asset account.  xxx



	23)	COA Circular No. 2013-002 dated January 30, 2013 prescribing the adoption of the Revised Chart of Accounts describes Construction in Progress –Buildings and Other Structures as an account used to record the accumulated cost or other appropriate value of buildings and other structures which are still in the process of construction or development.  This account is credited for reclassification to the appropriate Building and Other Structures account upon completion of the constructions project.



	24)	As of December 31, 2020, the balance of the account Construction in Progress –Buildings and Other Structures amounted to ₱133,736,576.75, broken down as follows:

	25)	Verification of the status of the Justice Center located at the DOJ Head Office Compound revealed 100 percent completion which was turned over and accepted by the Management officials on November 20, 2019.



	26)	Failure of the Accounting Division to reclassify the completed construction of Justice Center resulted in the misstatement of the Construction in Progress –Buildings and Other Structures account and the Buildings accounts both by ₱46,775,426.78.



	27)	We recommended that Management direct the Accounting Division to reclassify the completed projects to its appropriate account duly supported with required documents.



Management Comments



	28)	Management complied with corresponding adjusting entries to reflect the correct balance of the Construction in Progress –Buildings and Other Structures account under JEV Nos. 2021-01-000648-49 both dated Jan. 4, 2021.



	29)	The balance of the CIB account as of Jan. 31, 2021 amounted to ₱86,961,149.97 consisting only of the DOJ Academy/Training Center.

Audit of Advances to Contractors



5)	The balance of the Advances to Contractors account amounting to ₱30,054,689.66 is doubtful due to inclusion of long outstanding balances totaling ₱393,101.89 without details and balance amounting ₱904,694.20 tagged as “for reconciliation” without supporting documents.



	1)	Advances to Contractors is the account used to recognize amount advanced to contractors as authorized by law.  This account is credited for recoupment of advances.



	2)	Item No. 9.2.1. of the Notes to FS for CY 2020, indicates that Advances to Contractors are payments made in connection with the construction of various HOJ nationwide being implemented by the Department.  The amount advanced is being deducted from the contractors’ periodic progress billing.

	5)	Review of the account revealed that the balance includes advances to  contractor/supplier/.local government units which have been long outstanding in the books:

	6)	It was noted that the total amount pertains to the forwarded balances to the account in the adoption of new version of e-NGAS in November 2014. Since then, there were no recoupments made thereon. In addition, the SLs thereof did not indicate the particular project for which advances have been paid making the status of the projects hard to validate. 



	7)	On the other hand, the balance of advance payment to Herbana Builders and Supply amounting to ₱28,622.92 pertains to the unrecouped amount for repairs/improvements of various offices at the DOJ Head Office. It was noted that contractor’s claim for progress billing was made in 2015 and no succeeding claim was made from then on.



	8)	Moreover, Advances to Contractors amounting to ₱904,694.20 tagged as “for reconciliation” remained unreconciled and had been outstanding for more than five years. The non-reconciliation thereof affects the accuracy of advance payments made as the agency books do not properly identify the contractors and projects to which the same were intended.



	9)	The presence of these long outstanding balances without supporting documents and details rendered the balance of the Advances to Contractor account doubtful,



	10)	We recommended that Management:



a)	require the Accounting Division  to reconcile  the balance tagged  as “for reconciliation” and exert extra efforts to identify the contract/supplier to whom these advances had been made;



b)	revisit long outstanding advance payments made for projects which are determined to have been; (i) completed and ensure that these advances are deducted from the final billings, otherwise, initiate legal action to recoup the same; and (ii) rescinded or terminated and move for the recoupment of the same; and



c)		locate pertinent supporting documents on the subject projects for reference purposes.



Management Comments



	11)	The Chief Accountant commented during exit conference that they are doing their best to reconcile Advances to Contractors account which had been existing for so long.



COMPLIANCE AUDIT



Compliance to Rules and Provisions pertinent to the procurement of Goods and Services



1)	Failure of the DOJ to comply with the provisions of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 resulted in the: a) prolonged procurement process beyond the maximum allowable time of 136 calendar days; and b) delay in the delivery of procured goods amounting to ₱155,056.30, caused by the gaps in the implementation of procurement process. Moreover, advance copies of government contracts, purchase orders (POs) and its supporting documents were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed period of submission contrary to COA Circular No. 2009 – 01 dated February 12, 2020. 



a)	Prolonged Procurement Process



	1)	One of the governing principles on government procurements under the Revised IRR of the RA 9184 is the streamlined process of procurement which uniformly applies to all government procurements and ensures effective and efficient method.



	2)	Section 38.1 of the IRR of RA 9184 states that, the procurement process from the opening of bids up to the award of contract shall not exceed three (3) months, or a shorter period to be determined by the procuring entity concerned.



	3)	Additionally, Annex C of the said IRR further prescribes the period of action on the procurement activities providing for the latest allowable time as well as the maximum allowable period of action for each procurement activity. These periods are set forth to address the incessant delay in the procurement activities that is affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of government operations.



	4)	Scrutiny/evaluation of submitted contracts/POs for procurement of goods and services revealed that the period of action on one procurement activity exceeded the maximum allowable time of 136 calendar days (Annex B) as prescribed in the aforementioned law.  



	5)	The prolonged lengthy process/activity is not compliant to the afore-cited provisions of law which implies inefficiency in the implementation of the entire procurement process that may affect government operations and may result in the wastage of government resources.  



b)	Delays in the delivery of procured goods 



	6)	Section 3.1 Annex “D” of the 2016 Revised IRR of the RA No. 9184 provides that:  When the Supplier fails to satisfactorily deliver goods under the contract within the specified delivery schedule, inclusive of duly granted time extensions, if any, the supplier shall be liable for damages for the delay and shall pay the procuring entity, not by way of penalty, and amount equal to one tenth (1/10) of one (1) percent of the cost of the delayed goods scheduled for delivery for every day of delay until such goods are finally delivered and accepted by the procuring entity concerned.



	7)	Likewise, Section 3.2 Annex “D” of the same RA No. 9184 also provides that:  The procuring entity need not prove that it has incurred actual damages to be entitled to liquidated damages.  Such amount shall be deducted from any money due or which may become due to the supplier, or collected from any securities or warranties posted by the supplier, whichever is convenient the procuring entity concerned.



	8)	Section 68 of the same RA No. 9184 on liquidated damages also provides that:  All contracts executed in accordance with the Act and this IRR shall contain a provision on liquidated damages which shall be payable by the contractor in case of breach thereof.



	9)	The contract between DOJ and Remax International, Inc. under PO No. 2020-10-027 dated October 30, 2020 for the purchase of 10 units High-end Laptop and 104 units Regular Laptops was conformed by the supplier on November 10, 2020.  The contract specifically provides that:  The Terms of Engagement will be for three (3) years, with expected full supply, delivery and installation within sixty (60) calendar days after the receipt of the Notice to Proceed (NTP).



	10)	The NTP was received and acknowledged by the supplier on November 10, 2020 while the   delivery of 10 unit high-end laptops and 104 unit regular laptops was completed on February 5, 2021 based on the Delivery Receipt.



	11)	 It should be noted that the 60 calendar days stipulated in the contract period end on January 9, 2021.  Hence, the period from January 10, 2021 to February 5, 2021 or 26 calendar days (CDs) is subject to liquidated damages as provided in the contract.  Details of the computation are shown below:

	16)	Moreover, the Management also failed to submit complete copies of the required documents mentioned above as manifested by various Memoranda issued by the Audit Tam on lack of documents.



	17)	Non-compliance with the existing regulations hinders timely review of procurement contract where contract deficiencies, if any, may not be communicated to Management on time. 



	18)	We recommended that Management:



a)		direct concerned officials responsible in the different stages of the procurement process to submit explanations/justification for the lengthy and prolonged procurement process; 



b)	notify the supplier of the delay in the delivery of goods and the corresponding liquidated damages incurred thereon;  



c)	direct all officials concerned to strictly adhere to the provisions of the Revised IRR of R.A 9184 and COA rules and regulations; and



d)	submit advance copies of government contracts and POs, together with its supporting documents to the Audit Team within five working days from execution or from the date of perfection of the contract/PO.



Management Comments



	19)	Management commented that Remax International, Inc., supplier for the purchase of 10 units High-end laptop and 104 units regular laptop, submitted on Jan. 4, 2021 a request for 30-day extension due to the pandemic. The request for extension of delivery from Jan. 9, 2021 to Feb. 8, 2021 was approved on January 5, 2021; hence, no liquidated damages was imposed considering that the delivery is within the approved extension period.



	20)	Moreover, the award of contract to the lowest calculated responsive bid (LCRB) took sometime due to the conduct of three post-qualification activities one after the other by the BAC-TWG for ICTS.  Post qualified the third LCB after two (2) post-disqualification processes made with the technical eligibility documents submitted by Pronet Systems Integrated Network Solution, Inc. and Link Network Solutions Inc. 



	21)	Out of the 17 contracts submitted late by suppliers, three (3) were transmitted with incorrect dates; eight (8) were due to late submission of signed NOA/NTP/contract caused by pandemic; two (2) were considering some dates after the Dec. 18 Christmas Party and holidays; two (2) were due to suspension of work caused by typhoon Ulysses and lockdown; and two (2) were due to the late submission of notarized contract by PLDT.



	22)	For supplier’s non-submission of contracts, 15 contracts were already transmitted to COA.

	2)	The COs were assigned as collectors/tellers at the Frontline Services located at the front gate of the Department. They adopted an alternative work arrangement (AWA) or a skeletal force every two hours’ interval to perform their duties as collectors and thereafter, the duties attached to their position. The concerned CO, at the end of her turn, will remit her collections to the Chief Cashier together with the duplicate and triplicate copies of the Official Receipts (ORs) issued and return the unissued ORs. These collections are recorded in the logbook indicating only the date of collection and the amount collected.  After which, the Chief Cashier prepares the CRR. The unissued ORs are subsequently issued to the next CO. These ORs or accountable forms are under the accountability of the Chief Cashier and there are no separate ORs issued to the COs who are performing collecting functions.



	3)	Collections/receipts were primarily sourced from fees for issuance of clearance and certifications; and requests for certified copies of documents, imposed under Department Circular (DC) No. 060 dated October 5, 2012.  These collections accrue to the National Government (NG) and deposited to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr).



Non-preparation/maintenance of CRR



	4)	Chapter II (7) of COA Memo 2013-004 dated July 9, 2013 provides that: An AO shall maintain his cashbook/CRR/CDR/CkDR and such other records or their equivalents as may be prescribed by the agency’s operating procedures, and reconcile with the accounting records at least quarterly, unless the agency requires a more frequent reconciliation.



	5)	Moreover, under Appendix 29 of Volume II of the GAM, Cash Receipts Record (CRR) shall be maintained to monitor his/her accountability. All transactions for the day shall be recorded immediately and a balance (undeposited collection) shall be extracted. The record shall be certified correct by the Collecting Officer at the end of each month or when required to do so by proper competent authority.



	6)	It was noted that the designated COs did not prepare/maintain CRR to record collections; thus, their accountability could not be easily monitored and error in recording, if any, may not be easily detected.  The COs may have acted sub-collector or teller, however, they are accountable for having custody of government funds.   It should be noted that the Department has no guidelines on this set-up which contravenes to the provisions of the Revised Cash Examination Manual (RCEM) that obliges the AOs/COs to render reports of their collections and deposits. These reports serve as a control mechanism against unauthorized or unreported usage of collection and accountable forms.



Non-preparation of RAAF



	7)	GAM Volume I, Chapter 8, Section 17 (k), states that, Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) (Appendix 67) – shall be prepared by the Accountable Officer to report on the movement and status of accountable forms in his/her possession. The accountable forms include those with or without face value.” (Underscoring ours for emphasis)



	8)	As earlier discussed, accountable forms were not issued to COs; thus, the reason for non-preparation of RAAF. However, considering that these COs are designated as such, it is proper that separate ORs be issued under their accountability and be accounted in the RAAF.



	9)	We recommended that Management:



a)	direct the concerned Collecting Officers (COs) to prepare and maintain CRR to record collections and monitor their accountability pursuant to existing regulations; 



b)	issue separate OR to CO under their accountability and report the same in the RAAF; and  



c)	establish guidelines pertaining to designation of sub-collectors or tellers that will clearly define their duties and responsibilities.



Management Comments



	10)	Management commented that COs only assist in the collection of fees for issuance of clearance and certifications, and requests for certified copies of documents and religiously remit its collections to the Chief Cashier or Asst. Chief Cashier for daily deposit to the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP).



	11)	During the exit conference, the Undersecretary for Finance agreed to streamline the process by having one report of the Chief Cashier and will revise designations of COs.

	8)	From the above table, it can be inferred that out of the ₱115,266,000.00 total allotment for CO, ₱55,870,540.06 worth of projects have been initiated while only ₱46,372,121.42 or 40.23 percent was obligated as of December 2020.



	9)	The inability of DOJ to fully utilize the allotment received is not in keeping with the efficient spending as required in the afore-mentioned DBM Budget Circulars.  Moreover, the unobligated allotment of ₱266,232,741.22 may have impact in overall cash program of the government as the same can be utilized for other priority projects especially during these trying times.



	10)	We recommended that Management: (a) maximize the utilization of allotments thru proper planning and timely implementation of planned projects during the year; and (b) submit reasons/causes/explanation for failure to fully implement the projects earmarked for Capital Outlay.



Management Comments



	11)	Management commented that the utilization of funds as programmed was further limited in compliance with the pertinent provisions of RA No. 11469, s. 2020, otherwise known as “Bayanihan to Heal as One Act” and National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 580 dated 22 April 2020, entitled “Adoption of Economy Measures in the Government Due to Emergency Health Situation”, of the DBM.



	12)	The normal work operations in most of the agencies in the government had resumed at the later part of the third quarter after the lifting of the community quarantines being implemented in the national and local regions of the country, making it more difficult to implement the Department’s programmed procurement for the final quarter of FY 2020.



	13)	The details of the non-implemented procurement projects for FY 2020 are as follows:



Particulars

Unobligated Allotment

Reasons for non-implementation

2020 Appropriations

Communications Network

1,632,750.00

This amount represents the savings from the Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC) for procured communications network.



Reason:  In placed community quarantine, lockdown and work suspensions.

Building

50,000,000.00

The MOA for the proposed construction of DOJ Building in Davao City has not been signed by the contracting parties, which is beyond control of DOJ.

ICT Equipment

8,613,968.00

The SARO in the amount of Five Million Pesos was received only in December 2020 (OADR modification of funds).  The savings from bidding in the amount of ₱3,613,968.00 can no longer be utilized due to time constraint and implementation of several community quarantine, lockdown and work suspensions.

ICT Software

205,199.94

This is a savings which could not be programmed anymore due to time constraints and implementation of several community quarantine, lockdown and work suspensions.

Furniture and Fixture

1,831,000.00

The procurement of furniture and fixtures was implemented in the latter part of the year.  Hence, the bidding corresponding to the savings from the ABC can no longer be implemented.

Motor Vehicles

3,950,000.00

The SARO for this appropriation was released only in December 2020 (OADR fund modification) when the timelines for procurement cannot be met.  Hence, not implemented.

2019 Continuing Appropriations

ICT Equipment



303,926.00

These are savings which could not be programmed anymore due to time constraint and implementation of several community quarantine, lockdown and work suspensions.

ICT Software

2,357,034.64







Delayed/Non-submission of financial reports (FRs) and other supporting documents



2)	Financial and mandatory reports and other supporting documents were submitted late or not submitted within the prescribed period of submission contrary to the existing laws, rules and regulations;  thus,  precluding the Audit Team from rendering  timely verification/examination of financial accounts/ transactions, communication of results to Management and correction of deficiencies, if any. 



	1)	Section 100 of PD 1445 provides that:  Disbursing Officers in any government agency shall render monthly reports of their transactions pursuant to regulations of the Commission to be submitted not later than the fifth day of the ensuing month to the auditor concerned who shall conduct the necessary examination and audit within thirty days from receipt hereof.



	2)	In addition, Section 7.2.1 of the 2009 Revised Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) provides, among others, that: The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping function of the audited agency shall ensure that the reports and supporting documents submitted by the accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing months.



	3)	Further, Section 60, Chapter 19 of the GAM, Volume I re: Deadlines on Submission of Reports.  The trial balance (TB) shall be submitted within 10 days after the end of each month while the quarterly FS shall be submitted to the Auditor within 10 days after the end of each quarter.  Likewise, the year-end TB, FS and Statement of Management Responsibility for Financial Statements (MRFS) of the audited entity shall be submitted to the Auditor on February 14 of the following year.



	4)	Furthermore, Section 122 of PD No 1445 states:  Submission of Reports.  Whenever deemed necessary in the exigency of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel and such other reports as may be deemed necessary for the exercise of its functions.



	5)	One of the qualitative characteristics of financial reporting under PPSAS 1 is timeliness.  Timeliness affects usefulness of FS, reports and information for decision-making needs of users.  It is therefore of vital importance that FS, reports and information are submitted to auditors on time so that prompt review thereof could be made to detect errors and recommend corrections.



	6)	Review of records show that financial reports were not submitted or submitted beyond the prescribed period of submission, contrary to aforementioned laws, rules and regulations.   



	7)	The current challenges that the Audit Team faced was COVID 19 pandemic that started last March 2020 until to date. Related hereto there is significant service disruption on agency’s reporting of financial and mandatory reports.  Submission was significantly delayed and/or not submitted at all. Although computation of delays was adjusted and considered by the Audit Team, we also have to take into account our objectives and plans for the immediate and timely submission of the required financial and mandatory reports and other supporting documents for proper evaluation and disposition by the Auditor of the agency’s transactions. 



	8)	Details of the unsubmitted documents are as follows:

	9)	The delay of 100 days in the submission of transaction documents, such as DVs, JEVs and LVs is not in consonance with the provisions of COA Circular No. 95-006 and PD 1445.  The DVs and LVs were already recorded in the books of accounts and they should have been reviewed for completeness of supporting documents and authenticity of signatures of authorized officials; delays were considered on the first semester of the year, hence, documents by this time should have been transmitted to the Office of the Auditor.



	10)	Timely reporting of pertinent financial reports increases its usefulness however, information given becomes inoperable for decision-making purposes when relevant information no longer serves its purpose due to delay in the submission of reports.



	11)	On the other hand, delayed or non-submission of BRS precluded the Audit Team from conducting timely audit, review of accounts and communication of the audit results to Management for corrective actions. 



	12)	Also, initial review of the submitted contracts/POs, revealed that insufficient documentation in most of the contracts/POs, causes delay in the auditorial review thereof.



	13)	The failure to submit the financial reports, supporting schedules, documents and contracts within the prescribed timelines hindered the delivery of the mandated audit services.



	14)	Moreover, Section 32, Chapter 3 of the GAM, Volume I, on the Submission of Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (FARs) requires that: Äll departments/agencies shall observe the following timelines in submitting the required Financial Accountability Reports (FARs) to COA-GAS and DBM:



Within 30 days after the end of each quarter –



a)	Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and Balances (SAAODB) – FAR No. 1

b)	Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and Balances by Object of Expenditures (SAAODBOE) – FAR No. 1.A

c)	List of Allotments/Sub-Allotments – FAR No. 1.B

d)		Statement of Approved Budget, Utilization, Disbursements and Balances (SABUDB) – FAR No. 2

e)	Statement of Approved Budget, Utilization, Disbursements and Balances by Object of Expenditures (SABUDBOE) – FAR No. 2.A

f)	Quarterly Report of Revenue and Other Receipts (QRROR)-FAR No. 5



On or before 30th day following the end of the year – Aging of Due and Demandable Obligations (ADDO) – FAR No. 3

On or before 30th day of the following month covered – Monthly Report of Disbursements (MRD) – FAR No. 4



	15)	Management should take heed of the policy, that failure to submit the above reports within the prescribed period is contrary to applicable pertinent laws, rules and regulations, affects the timely verification of reports, early detection of deficiencies which could probably be corrected right away, and promptly communicate the audit results to Management for speedy and appropriate action.



	16)	We recommended that Management require the:



a)	Accountant and concerned AOs to immediately submit the Monthly TB, BRS, DVs, RCDs, JEVs, FRs and other supporting schedules and documents within the prescribed timelines;



b)	Heads of Offices concerned to submit copies of perfected contracts and POs with all documents forming part thereof to the Audit Team within the prescribed period for timely review and evaluation of the same; and



c)	Budget Officer to submit BFARs within the prescribed period.



Management Comments



	17)	Management commented that COVID-19 pandemic had significantly affected the timeliness of submission of financial and other mandatory reports to the Office of the Auditor.  In addition, LDDAP-ADAs were not immediately validated by the LBP which caused further delay.



	18)	Reports from LBP such as BS and LDDAP-ADA validation were received belatedly by the Accounting Division.  In effect, this caused the delayed submission of BRS.



11.20	Management had directed the various NCR offices to submit the RCD on or before the 5th day of the following month. Accordingly, they will do their best to comply with the submission of required reports and documents on time.





Gender and Development Funds



3)	The DOJ failed to submit GAD Plan and Budget (GPB), Accomplishment Report (AR) and its supporting documents for CY 2020, contrary to Section 31 of the GAA of CY 2020. 



	1)	Section 31 of  GAA of CY 2020 provides that: All agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within the their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).



	2)	The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies, which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfilment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with the said requirement. Utilization of GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.



	3)	The preparation and submission of the annual GPB, and the annual GAD AR shall be subject to the guidelines issued by the agencies concerned.



	4)	The guidelines and procedures for the formulation, development, submission, implementation, monitoring and evaluation including accounting of results of agency annual GPB and ARs to implement the Magna Carta of Women shall be guided by Joint Circular No. 2012-01 issued by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) and DBM for review and endorsement.



	5)	Also, Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 requires that:  The Audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GPB to the COA Audit Team assigned to the agency within five (5) working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the PCW or their mother or central offices, as the case maybe.  Likewise, a copy of the corresponding AR shall be furnished the said Audit Team within five (5) working days from the end of January of the preceding year.



	6)	For CY 2020, the Department failed to comply with the provisions of Section 31 of GAA of CY 2020 by not submitting GAD Plan and Budget, Accomplishment Report and its supporting documents for CY 2020. 



	7)	We recommended that Management require the GAD Focal Person to explain the reasons why the Department failed to comply with the pertinent provisions of the GAA for CY 2020.



Management Comments



	8)	Management commented that the GAD Plan and Budget for 2020 was submitted, reviewed and endorsed through the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System in September 2019. 



	9)	For FY 2020 GAD Accomplishment Report, the PCW issued  Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 2021, which provides the deadline of encoding and submission to the GMMS of the GAD Accomplishment Report for Executive Department on March 12, 2021, however, this memo circular was not referred to the Planning Division.  They requested PCW for a new schedule to encode the FY 2020 GAD AR through their GMMS for their review and endorsement.





Audit of Programs and Projects for SCs and PWDs



4)	The DOJ has integrated in its regular activities the plans, programs and projects intended to benefit and address the concerns of Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs), in consonance with the provisions of Section 32 of the GAA of CY 2020.



	1)	Section 32 of the GAA of CY 2020 provides that: All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs, and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their activities.



	2)	Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide architectural or structural features, designs, or facilities that will reasonably enhanced the mobility, safety, and welfare of persons with disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa No. 344 and R.A. No. 7277, as amended. 



	3)	In view of the above provisions, the Department of Justice Action Center (DOJAC) is one of the frontline services of DOJ tasked to perform legal counselling and referral, if applicable, conducts mediation conferences if parties agree to participate in the process, administer oaths and perform other duties and responsibilities that may be assigned by the Department.  Further, the SCs and PWDs are given priority with regard to giving free legal assistance with matters specifically cases of land problems, unjust vexation, B.P. 22 and other legal matters.



	4)	DOJAC’s continuing commitment to SCs and PWDs are the following:



a)	Prioritize them in the queuing for DOJAC services;

b)	Assign DOJAC’s office at the ground floor of JDC building to provide easy access to all types of clients; especially SCs and PWDs;

c)	Construct a 3-story NPS building with stainless handrail for PWDs;

d)	Improve and maintain  Frontline Service Area to provide easy access to PWDs and senior citizens;  

e)	Provide chairs to clients who are on que but due to the limited number and space, priority is given to SCs and PWDs; and 

f)	Offer hot or cold water to clients, including SCs and PWDs.



	5)	For CY 2020, there is a decrease of accomplishments related to SCs and PWDs as shown below:



Clients

Total Number of PWDs

1114%



	6)	The variance between the CYs 2020 and 2019 accomplishments was brought about by the existing health situation due to COVID-19 pandemic that affected the number of walk-in clients including the SCs and PWDs. 



	7)	The total number of SCs served was 304 which is 654 lower than the 958 served in 2019 or 315 per cent decrease. On the other hand, the PWDs with 14 clients served or 1,114 percent decrease in CY 2020.



	8)	Moreover, the Department was able to comply with the pertinent provisions of the GAA in addressing the concerns of their SCs and PWDs by adopting the Omnibus Guidelines for the Implementation of Community Quarantine in the Philippines, in relation to the relevant Resolutions of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Disease (IATF).



	9)	We recommended that Management continue to provide efficient and effective programs and projects, and further formulate and implement new plans, programs, and projects intended to address the concerns of SCs and PWDs even during this pandemic period.



Management Comments



	10)	Management commented that for CY 2020 and prior years, only walk-in clients were segregated to determine who are Differently Abled Persons (DAPs) and SCs.



	11)	From March to June 2020, the Luzon lockdown was implemented and subsequently the IATF issued directives for elderly and other vulnerable sectors to stay home, as a result, an abrupt decline of walk-in clients and an unexpected increase in Facebook and email clients.



	12)	DOJAC’s previous procedure does not enable the Center and its workforce to adequately monitor DAPs and SCs in Facebook and email, since there was no existing protocol on how to handle the segregation of clients.



	13)	In February 2021, after several consultations with the Center’s workforce and with the approval of DOJAC Director, it updated its procedures on information gathering, thus, a more detailed and transparent report of its clients especially on DAPs and SCs.  By the end of FY 2021, DOJAC will be able to provide a more detailed statistic for said clients.

	1)	Section 5 of RA No. 656 or the PIL, as amended by PD No. 245 series of 1973 requires that:  Every government, except a municipal government below first class, is hereby required to insure its properties, with the Fund against any insurable risk herein provided and pay the premiums thereon, which, however, shall not exceed the premiums charged by private insurance companies.

	3)	Further, COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018, prescribes the guidelines in the submission of the PIF as basis for the assessment of general insurance coverage over all insurable assets, properties and interests of the government with the GIF of the GSIS.
