Dear Chairperson Adamat and President Derije:



We are pleased to transmit the Annual Audit Report on the audit of the Central Mindanao University, University Town, Musuan, Maramag, Bukidnon for Calendar Year 2020 in compliance with Section 2, Article IX-D of the Philippine Constitution and Section 43 of Presidential Decree no. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines.



The audit was conducted to (a) ascertain the degree of reliance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (c) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.



The attached report consists of Part I- Audited Financial Statements, Part II-Observations and Recommendations, Part III- Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations, and Part IV- Appendices.



We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs) and we believe that it provided a reasonable basis for the audit results.



	The Auditor rendered a modified-qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements due to the following: (1) The existence, completeness and correctness of the balances of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) totaling ₱815,798,334.00 that could not be ascertained due to unreconciled PPE ledger accounts against the submitted Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE), (2) Failure of the Supply and Property Management Unit and the Accounting Unit to adhere to the proper monitoring, controlling and recording of acquisition and disposal of inventory contrary to Section 13 to 15, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs thus rendering the existence and accuracy of the reported balances of Inventory accounts totaling ₱79,487,706.72 unreliable; and (3) Accuracy of the Account School Fees of Fund Cluster 5 (Special Trust Fund) as of December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱222,320,069.53 cannot be ascertained due to improper recording of Income Account from school fees reversal of Unearned Income and use of unreliable data as basis of adjustments.



The above and other observations with their corresponding recommendations are discussed in detail on Part II of the report.



We request that a status report, thru accomplishing the attached Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation form, on the actions taken on the audit recommendations be submitted, pursuant to Section 89 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act FY 2020.



We appreciate the invaluable support and cooperation extended by the officials and staff of that Agency to the Audit Team during the audit engagement.







Very truly yours,

Trial Balances are submitted without the supporting schedules in violation of Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, thus, the conduct of prompt verification of accounts and financial transactions as well as the early detection and correction of errors/deficiencies, if any, cannot be made.



We recommended to the management to require the Accountant to comply with the submission of the trial balances with complete supporting schedules within the prescribed deadline set for the submission of the reports and documents to the office of the Auditor as required under Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. 



















Various disbursements relating to the Board of Regents’ activities in the total amount of ₱71,900.00 were paid out from the Special Trust Fund contrary to Section 4.3 of PD 1445 and Section 4 of Republic Act 8292, resulting to the improper utilization of the fund and   affecting the fair presentation of the Special Trust Fund’s Financial Statements.

We recommended that management:



a. Replenish the Special Trust Fund with an amount from the General Fund equivalent to the valid claims disbursed from the former or we will be constrained to disallow these payments; and



b. Adhere to the prescribed rules and regulations regarding the disbursement of funds under the Special Trust Fund.



















Management failed to furnish the Audit Team copies of Contract Variation Orders such as the Change Orders/Extra Work Orders and Time Extension Documents contrary to the provisions in COA Circular 2009-001 and COA Memorandum 2005-027 on the submission of copy of government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents to the Commission on Audit, thus the legality, validity and reasonableness of the said documents cannot be ascertained.



We recommended that management submit immediately all Variation Orders and Time Extensions incurred and approved during the CY 2020 and other supporting documents based on the checklist required by the Annexes B & E of COA Circular 2009-001 and henceforth, adhere to the above provisions for a timely conduct of the required evaluation.



















The University failed to submit the documentary requirements for the grant of relief from accountability for the death of various livestock totaling ₱1,403,232.36 as of November 30, 2020, ₱818,966.99 of which have questionable specific stewards in violation to Section 3c.4, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of GAM for NGAs and COA Memorandum No. 92-751 dated February 24, 1992  resulting to inefficiency in the handling of government property and overstatement of assets thus, financial statements are not fairly presented.



We recommended to Management the following actions:



a. Require the Veterinarians to provide the necropsy reports of the dead animals within   15 days from receipt hereof or we will be constrained to disallow the amounts;



b. Require all the Project Heads to submit the requests for relief from accountability with   the documentary requirements as required by COA Memorandum No. 92-751 dated February 24, 1992 (Refer to Table 2);



c. Require the Accountant and all the Project Heads to fast track the settlement of    outstanding accountabilities immediately;



d. Require the Project Head under the Dairy Project to submit satisfactory explanation detailing the absence of negligence regarding the death of the animal with ear tag no. 246-G19*; 



e. In case government properties are transferred from one Project Head to another, or from an outgoing personnel to his successor, require the Directors of Livestock Enterprise Office and Crops Enterprise Office to implement strict and appropriate turnover of responsibilities among the Project Heads to avoid destabilization of each project unit; and



f. Hereafter, strictly observe the reglementary period in the submission of relief from accountabilities to avoid suspensions/disallowances.



















Several mortalities of various livestock were not recorded in the books of the agency contrary to Section 6, Chapter 19, Volume 1 and Chapter 3, Volume III of GAM for NGAs hence understated the “Due from Officers and Employees Account” by ₱29,310.00.



We recommended to Management to require the bookkeeper to draw a journal voucher to transfer the recording of the animals from Cluster 6 to Cluster 5 – STF 164. Moreover, submit the documentary requirements for the grant of relief for the dead animals within 15 days from receipt of this report.                                



 















Discrepancies were noted in the recording and monitoring of livestock of the University contrary to Section 21, Chapter 5, Volume 1 of GAM for NGAs and Section 5 of General Appropriations Act of CY 2020 resulting to the understatement of the related asset account by at least ₱3,623,075.00. 



We recommended to management the following, to wit:



a. Provide the audit team with the documents e.g. deed of donation (if acquired through donation);



b. Require the Accounting Unit to secure reference of fair values or appraisal by a member of the valuation profession who holds a recognized and relevant professional qualification prior to recording of these livestock as required by Section 26, Chapter 5, Volume 1 of GAM for NGAs;



c. Require the Accountant to instruct the respective bookkeepers to record these livestock in the appropriate books of accounts supported with complete & proper documents; and



d. Henceforth, secure proper documentary requirements prior to acceptance and delivery of any livestock from any government agencies and/or private entities in the future.



















Disbursements for Collective Negotiation Allowance   in the amount of ₱22,280,792.23 for CY 2019 and ₱8,672,089.40 for CY 2020 were not supported with sufficient and relevant documents contrary to the Item 6, Section 4 of PD No. 1445, Item 5.6 of COA Circular 2012-01 and existing DBM guidelines, thus validity of the transaction could not be ascertained.  



We recommended to management to 

a. Submit the documentary requirements for CNA Incentives granted in CY 2019 and CY 2020 not later than February 15, 2021 or we will be constrained to disallow all payments on CNA, to wit:

--	Resolution signed by both parties incorporating the guidelines/criteria in granting CNA,

--	Comparative statement of DBM approved level of operating expenses and actual operating expenses,

--	Certificate issued by the Head of Agency on the total amount of unencumbered savings generated from cost-cutting measures identified in the CNA which resulted from the joint efforts of labor and management and systems/productivity/income improvement,

--	Proof that the planned programs/activities/projects have been implemented and completed in accordance with targets for the year,

--	Savings generated from the allowable MOOE allotments (emphasis ours),

--	Copy of the accountability report submitted to the DBM as of September 30 of each year the CNA was granted, and

--	Copy of Annex A duly received by the DBM’s Budget and Management Bureau or Regional Office.

--	Copy of the Board of Regents’ approved resolution on the use of savings for the payment of CNA Incentive, if necessary; and

b. Henceforth, observe and submit the documentary requirements for the CNA Incentive.





















The University granted Collective Negotiation Agreement Incentive in the amount of ₱985,000.00 to Contract of Service personnel contrary to Section 4 of PD 1445, Item 3 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2019-5, dated November 7, 2019 thus regularity of the transaction is in question.



We recommended to management to require the COS personnel who received the CNA Incentive to refund within 90 days from the date of this observation or require the personnel who signed the DVs to pay the amount and henceforth adhere to the guidelines to be issued by DBM for the grant of CNA Incentive.



















The recording of the amount paid as CNA Incentive in the amount of ₱22,280,792.23, and ₱8,672,089.47, for CYs 2019 and 2020 respectively were not observed contrary to Section 112 of PD 1445 and specific DBM Budget Circular, thus affecting the accuracy of the presentation of the Financial Statements.



We recommended to management in the meantime to reclassify the account used to record the payment of CNA Incentive in CY 2020 and henceforth adhere to the prescribed account recommended by the DBM for CNA Incentive.



















Accuracy of the account School Fees of Fund Cluster 5 (Special Trust Fund) as of December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱222,320,069.53 cannot be ascertained due to improper recording of Income Account from school fees reversal of Unearned Income and use of unrealiable data as basis of adjustments contrary to COA CL 2004-002 thus, casting doubts on the accuracy and fairness of presentation of the financial statements. 



We recommended the following:		

a. The accounting unit should strictly comply with the Accounting Guidelines and Procedures on the Proper Recording of Income from Tuition Fees of State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) set under COA CL 2004-002.

b. Use the total assessment of all enrollees for every semester as basis in setting Accounts Receivable and School Fees not the MIS Enrollment System generated balance.  

c. Prepare the necessary adjusting entri/es to reflect the correct balance of the account School Fee for CY 2020.

















Reliability of the balances of the Cash-in-Bank-Local Currency Account in the total amount of ₱488,194,750.24 could not be ascertained in view of the variance of ₱88,861,665.91 between the book and bank records due to accounting office’s failure to submit the Bank Reconciliation Statement contrary to Section 74 and 122 of PD 1445 and Sections 5 to 7, Chapter 21 of GAM Volume 1.



We recommend the management to:

a. Prepare the necessary adjusting entries for the various reconciling items to reflect the correct amount of cash in bank balance.

b. Submit the required Bank Reconciliation Statements for CY 2020.



c. Henceforth, observe timely submission of the BRS and conduct regular adjusting entries on reconciling items as prescribed by the existing rules and regulations. 



















	Construction of the Bunkhouse by administration was done without the necessary documents nor can it be found as project in the APP or PPMP in violation of Section 8, Chapter 10 of the GAM and Section 4 of PD 1445, thus, asset and expenses were understated.



We recommended that management submit all the documents within 20 days from receipt of this report or we will disallow the construction of the bunkhouse.



















The balance of the Office Supplies Inventory as of December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱ 8,230,914.07 was unreliable due to improper accounting treatment of the payments to PS-DBM contrary to Section 111 of PD 1445, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1 and Chapter 3, Volume III of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, thus resulting to overstatement of the inventory account and understatement of the receivable account. 



We recommended the management to: 

a. Be consistent in using the suggested accounting entry for purchases from PS DBM.  Establish the cost of undelivered items and record a receivable from the PS DBM 

b. Require the SPMU to submit to the accounting unit the delivery receipts of PS-DBM and the Official Receipt as basis for crediting the Due from NGAs – PS-DBM account.

c. Require the Property Officer, among others, to continue close coordination with PS-DBM to expedite deliveries of the undelivered office supplies and if otherwise initiate a request for refund to PS-DBM for the said supplies. 

d. Require thereafter the accounting unit and SPMU to reconcile their respective records at least quarterly to ensure a correct balance of the Due from NGAs – PS-DBM.

















The existence and accuracy of the Inventory account balances of ₱ 79,487,706.72 as of December 31, 2020 cannot be ascertained due to non-submission of    Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) contrary to Section 13, Chapter 8 of GAM which resulted to failure to conduct periodic reconciliation between SPMU and Accounting Unit.

	

We recommended the management to:



a. Explain the non-submission of the Report in the Physical Count of Inventories as of December 31, 2020.



b. Require the Property/Supply Officer to submit duly accomplished Report of the Physical Count of Inventories and maintain and/or update stock cards to record purchases and issuances of inventories; and



c. Adhere to semi-annual conduct of physical count of inventories and conduct periodic reconciliation to ensure completeness and accuracy of balances of inventory accounts. 



















Actual net income & expenses on the operations of projects covered by contract of agreements entered into by the University with private entities cannot be reliably determined due to the absence of financial reports and other supporting documents contrary to Section 7.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated Sept. 15, 2019 and Section 2 & 3, Chapter 4, Volume 1 of GAM for NGAs.



We recommended the Management the following:



a. Submit the progress reports of the 2018 Project Athena;



b. Submit the financial reports of the projects entered into by the University with private entities; and



c. Establish a Responsibility Center and Responsibility Accounting for the CMU-PILMICO partnership program, CMU-Houston Marketing, CMU- RJR Agro-Industrial Enterprises, and CMU- Growers Agricultural Supply agreements.



















Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) of ₱ 815,798,334.00 in the Financial Statements is not reliable due to non-submission of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) and Property Cards were not updated and no reconciliation of accounting and property office records, contrary to Section 38 and 42 of Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume 1 resulting to doubts on the existence and accuracy of the PPE account balances presented in the financial statements. 



We recommended the management to:

a. Require the Inventory Committee to prepare the RPCPPE and furnish the auditor with copy of the report. Consequently, the Inventory Committee should strictly observe the deadline of submission of RPCPPE set forth in Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume 1.

b. Reconcile the balances appearing in the inventory report with the subsidiary ledger records of the accounting so that the total valuation of properties appearing in the TB could be validated as to its existence and completeness. 

c. Require the Supply Officer to regularly update the property cards on each of the PPE account in order to come up with realistic data of property inventory data of property inventory account.

d. Assign full-time office staff who will update, maintain and monitor property cards and other records and if possible, avoid fast turn-over of employees that leads to the weak monitoring of records.

















Returned and/or denied PhilHealth claims amounting to ₱651,739.00 and billings not recognized as income amounting to P4.3 Million, both for CY 2020 were deemed to be disadvantageous to the agency, inconsistent with the principles and guidelines set forth in PD 1445 – ‘State Auditing Code of the Philippines’, RA 8292 – ‘Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997’, and the Government Accounting Manual, thus, depleting the Hospital’s resources which could have been used for beneficial purposes and understating the Hospital Fees account as of year-end.



It is recommended that management adhere to the following measures:

	a. Foremost, hospital management shall strictly adhere to the procedures and policies required by PhilHealth especially in its current system in the submission of billings for claims to be able to reduce the amount of denied/returned claims and more importantly, to reduce its additional cost at the expense of the University Hospital;

	b. Henceforth, the Accounting Unit and the Billing Unit of the University Hospital shall coordinate with each other to the effect that every time billings are sent to PhilHealth, the Accounting Unit shall likewise be furnished a copy to enable them to timely make the proper entry to recognize Accounts Receivable [from PhilHealth and Income from Hospital Fees.

	

















	Expired drugs and medicines amounting to ₱197,919.49 remained in the premises of the hospital as of December 31, 2020 and likewise was not dropped from the books of accounts, inconsistent with the guidelines stated in the Revised Health Care Waste Management of the DOH and the Government Accounting Manual, thus, posing an environmental risk and exposing the said expired medicines to misuse and accidental contamination or poisoning and overstating the Inventory Account as of year-end.

		It is recommended that management adhere to the following measures:

		a. Fast tract the completion of the requested septic vault in order for the university hospital to hastily dispose of the expired drugs and medicines and other related items in the appropriate manner as provided for by the DOH guidelines;

	b. Review the roles and responsibilities of each unit involved such that the identification, recognition and recording of expired/unserviceable drugs and medicines is done in accordance with the agency’s Supply and Property Management Manual and the related rules and regulations.



















The Resource Generation and Management Office’s (RGMO) overall net loss of ₱12,479,911.82 for the period ended December 31, 2020 and the underperformance of some IGPs for the last five years could affect the objective of the University to fund its development needs.



We recommended the Management the following:



a. Establish strict internal control particularly in the disbursement of RGMO funds;



b. Require the Project Heads to submit monthly and/or quarterly status reports and other pertinent reports necessary for the monitoring of each IGP’s performance to the VP for RGMO;



c. Require appropriate turnover of documents in case of transfer of Project Heads from one project to another to avoid displacement of IGPs; and



d. Reassess and evaluate the existing strategy employed by the RGMO to make each IGP reach its target especially on maximizing its revenue and minimize its expenses.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)	INTRODUCTION 



The Central Mindanao University (CMU) has transformed from its humble beginning from being one of the few settlement farm schools in Mindanao organized by pioneering Americans in 1910 simply named Mailag Industrial School. By then, it offered only the first four grades of the elementary agriculture curriculum.  It was renamed Bukidnon Agricultural School in 1918 when three more grades were added completing the elementary agriculture to grade seven. It underwent several renaming, relocations and proclamations until in June 19, 1965, by virtue of R.A. 4498 it was renamed into the CMU.



Section 2 of Republic Act No. 4498 mandates that CMU shall provide programs of instruction at all levels in the arts, sciences, technical, professional, educational, and philosophical fields, and shall concern itself with “pure” and “applied” research in all branches of knowledge for the intellectual and professional growth of faculty members, for the advance instruction of students, and for increasing knowledge and understanding. 



It is the university’s mission to advance the frontiers of knowledge for economic prosperity, moral integrity, social and cultural sensitivity, and environmental consciousness through equitable access to quality instruction, research, extension and production. Its vision is to sustain as an academic paradise of higher learning actively committed to the total development of people for a globally sustainable environment and humane society.

	

CMU is committed in fulfilling faithfully its vision and mission. Its accomplishments represent the continuing achievements of the university through the coordinated efforts of its stakeholders.



Dr. Jesus Antonio G. Derije, the 9th President that currently navigated the journey of the university was elected by the CMU Board of Regents (BOR) on December 21, 2018.

D)	INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



	The Auditor rendered a modified-qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements due to the following: (1) The existence, completeness and correctness of the balances of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) totaling ₱815,798,334.00 that could not be ascertained due to unreconciled PPE ledger accounts against the submitted Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE); (2) Failure of the Supply and Property Management Unit and the Accounting Unit to adhere to the proper monitoring, controlling and recording of acquisition and disposal of inventory contrary to Section 13 to 15, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs thus rendering the existence and accuracy of the reported balances of Inventory accounts totaling ₱79,487,706.72 unreliable; and (3) Accuracy of the Account School Fees of Fund Cluster 5 (Special Trust Fund) as of December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱222,320,069.53 cannot be ascertained due to improper recording of Income Account from school fees reversal of Unearned Income and use of unreliable data as basis of adjustments.





E.	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



In addition to the aforecited reasons for a modified-qualified opinion, the following were noted:



1. Trial Balances are submitted without the supporting schedules in violation of Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, thus, the conduct of prompt verification of accounts and financial transactions as well as the early detection and correction of errors/deficiencies, if any, cannot be made.



We recommended tha management require the Accountant to comply with the submission of the trial balances with complete supporting schedules within the prescribed deadline set for the submission of the reports and documents to the office of the Auditor as required under Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. 



2. 	Management failed to furnish the Audit Team copies of Contract Variation Orders such as the Change Orders/Extra Work Orders and Time Extension Documents contrary to the provisions in COA Circular 2009-001 and COA Memorandum 2005-027 on the submission of copy of government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents to the Commission on Audit, thus the legality, validity and reasonableness of the said documents cannot be ascertained.



We recommended that management submit immediately all Variation Orders and Time Extensions incurred and approved during the CY 2020 and other supporting documents based on the checklist required by the Annexes B & E of COA Circular 2009-001 and henceforth, adhere to the above provisions for a timely conduct of the required evaluation.



3. 	The University failed to submit the documentary requirements for the grant of relief from accountability for the death of various livestock totaling ₱1,403,232.36 as of November 30, 2020, ₱818,966.99 of which have questionable specific stewards in violation to Section 3c.4, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of GAM for NGAs and COA Memorandum No. 92-751 dated February 24, 1992  resulting to inefficiency in the handling of government property and overstatement of assets thus, financial statements are not fairly presented.



We recommended that Management:



a) 	Require the Veterinarians to provide the necropsy reports of the dead animals within   15 days from receipt hereof or we will be constrained to disallow the amounts;



b) 	Require all the Project Heads to submit the requests for relief from accountability with the documentary requirements as required by COA Memorandum No. 92-751 dated February 24, 1992 (Refer to Table 2);



c) 	Require the Accountant and all the Project Heads to fast track the settlement of    outstanding accountabilities immediately;



d) 	Require the Project Head under the Dairy Project to submit satisfactory explanation detailing the absence of negligence regarding the death of the animal with ear tag no. 246-G19*; 



e) In case government properties are transferred from one Project Head to another, or from an outgoing personnel to his successor, require the Directors of Livestock Enterprise Office and Crops Enterprise Office to implement strict and appropriate turnover of responsibilities among the Project Heads to avoid destabilization of each project unit; and



f)	Hereafter, strictly observe the reglementary period in the submission of relief from accountabilities to avoid suspensions/disallowances.



4. 	Several mortalities of various livestock were not recorded in the books of the agency contrary to Section 6, Chapter 19, Volume 1 and Chapter 3, Volume III of GAM for NGAs hence understated the “Due from Officers and Employees Account” by ₱29,310.00.



We recommended that Management require the bookkeeper to draw a journal voucher to transfer the recording of the animals from Cluster 6 to Cluster 5 – STF 164. Moreover, submit the documentary requirements for the grant of relief for the dead animals within 15 days from receipt of this report. 



5. 	Discrepancies were noted in the recording and monitoring of livestock of the University contrary to Section 21, Chapter 5, Volume 1 of GAM for NGAs and Section 5 of General Appropriations Act of CY 2020 resulting to the understatement of the related asset account by at least ₱3,623,075.00. 



We recommended that management:



a) 	Provide the audit team with the documents e.g. deed of donation (if acquired through donation); 



b) 	Require the Accounting Unit to secure reference of fair values or appraisal by a member of the valuation profession who holds a recognized and relevant professional qualification prior to recording of these livestock as required by Section 26, Chapter 5, Volume 1 of GAM for NGAs;



c) 	Require the Accountant to instruct the respective bookkeepers to record these livestock in the appropriate books of accounts supported with complete & proper documents; and



d) 	Henceforth, secure proper documentary requirements prior to acceptance and delivery of any livestock from any government agencies and/or private entities in the future.

6. 	Disbursements for Collective Negotiation Allowance in the amount of ₱22,280,792.23 for CY 2019 and ₱8,672,089.4 for CY 2020 were not supported with sufficient and relevant documents contrary the Item 6, Section 4 of PD No. 1445, Item 5.6 of COA Circular 2012-01 and existing DBM guidelines thus, validity of the transaction could not be ascertained. Moreover, recording also of the allowance was not in accordance to DBM BC 2019-5 and 2020-5 issued on November 7, 2019.

We recommended that management:

a) 	Reclassify the account used to record the payment of CNA Incentive in CY 2020 and henceforth adhere to the prescribed account recommended by the DBM for CNA Incentive; 

b) 	Submit the documentary requirements for CNA Incentives granted in CY 2019 and CY 2020 not later than February 15, 2021 or we will be constrained to disallow all payments on CNA, to wit:

--	Resolution signed by both parties incorporating the guidelines/criteria in granting CAN;

--	Comparative statement of DBM approved level of operating expenses and actual operating expenses;

--	Certificate issued by the Head of Agency on the total amount of unencumbered savings generated from cost-cutting measures identified in the CNA which resulted from the joint efforts of labor and management and systems/productivity/income improvement;

--	Proof that the planned programs/activities/projects have been implemented and completed in accordance with targets for the year;

--	Savings generated from the allowable MOOE allotments (emphasis ours);

--	Copy of the accountability report submitted to the DBM as of September 30 of each year the CNA was granted;

--	Copy of Annex A duly received by the DBM’s Budget and Management Bureau or Regional Office; and

--	Copy of the Board of Regents’ approved resolution on the use of savings for the payment of CNA Incentive, if necessary; and

c) Henceforth, observe and submit the documentary requirements for the CNA Incentive.



7. 	The University granted Collective Negotiation Agreement Incentive in the amount of ₱985,000.00 to Contract of Service personnel contrary to Section 4 of PD 1445, Item 3 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2019-5, dated November 7, 2019 thus regularity of the transaction is in question.

We recommended that management require the COS personnel who received the CNA Incentive to refund within 90 days from the date of this observation or require the personnel who signed the DVs to pay the amount and henceforth adhere to the guidelines to be issued by DBM for the grant of CNA Incentive.

8. Reliability of the balances of the Cash-in-Bank-Local Currency Account in the total amount of ₱488,194,750.24 could not be ascertained in view of the variance of ₱88,861,665.91 between the book and bank records due to accounting office’s failure to submit the Bank Reconciliation Statement contrary to Section 74 and 122 of PD 1445 and Sections 5 to 7, Chapter 21 of GAM Volume 1.

We recommended that management:

a) Prepare the necessary adjusting entries for the various reconciling items to reflect the correct amount of cash in bank balance;

b) Submit the required Bank Reconciliation Statements for CY 2020; and

c) 	Henceforth, observe timely submission of the BRS and conduct regular adjusting entries on reconciling items as prescribed by the existing rules and regulations. 

	9. 	Construction of the Bunkhouse by administration was done without the necessary documents nor can it be found as project in the APP or PPMP in violation of Section 8, Chapter 10 of the GAM and Section 4 of PD 1445, thus, asset and expenses were understated.

We recommended that management submit all the documents within 20 days from receipt of this report or we will disallow the construction of the bunkhouse.

10. The balance of the Office Supplies Inventory as of December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱ 8,230,914.07 was unreliable due to improper accounting treatment of the payments to PS-DBM contrary to Section 111 of PD 1445, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1 and Chapter 3, Volume III of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, thus resulting to overstatement of the inventory account and understatement of the receivable account. 



We recommended that management: 



a) 	Be consistent in using the suggested accounting entry for purchases from PS DBM.  Establish the cost of undelivered items and record a receivable from the PS DBM;

b) 	Require the SPMU to submit to the accounting unit the delivery receipts of PS-DBM and the Official Receipt as basis for crediting the Due from NGAs – PS-DBM account;

c) 	Require the Property Officer, among others, to continue close coordination with PS-DBM to expedite deliveries of the undelivered office supplies and if otherwise initiate a request for refund to PS-DBM for the said supplies; and

d)	Require thereafter the accounting unit and SPMU to reconcile their respective records at least quarterly to ensure a correct balance of the Due from NGAs – PS-DBM.



11. 	Actual net income & expenses on the operations of projects covered by contract of agreements entered into by the University with private entities cannot be reliably determined due to the absence of financial reports and other supporting documents contrary to Section 7.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated Sept. 15, 2019 and Section 2 & 3, Chapter 4, Volume 1 of GAM for NGAs.



We recommended that Management:



a) 	Submit the progress reports of the 2018 Project Athena;



b) 	Submit the financial reports of the projects entered into by the University with private entities; and



c) 	Establish a Responsibility Center and Responsibility Accounting for the CMU-PILMICO partnership program, CMU-Houston Marketing, CMU- RJR Agro-Industrial Enterprises, and CMU- Growers Agricultural Supply agreements.

12. 	Returned and/or denied PhilHealth claims amounting to ₱651,739.00 and billings not recognized as income amounting to P4.3 Million, both for CY 2020 were deemed to be disadvantageous to the agency, inconsistent with the principles and guidelines set forth in PD 1445 – ‘State Auditing Code of the Philippines’, RA 8292 – ‘Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997’, and the Government Accounting Manual, thus, depleting the Hospital’s resources which could have been used for beneficial purposes and understating the Hospital Fees account as of year-end.

We recommended that management adhere to the following measures:

	a) 	Foremost, hospital management shall strictly adhere to the procedures and policies required by PhilHealth especially in its current system in the submission of billings for claims to be able to reduce the amount of denied/returned claims and more importantly, to reduce its additional cost at the expense of the University Hospital; and

	b) 	Henceforth, the Accounting Unit and the Billing Unit of the University Hospital shall coordinate with each other to the effect that every time billings are sent to PhilHealth, the Accounting Unit shall likewise be furnished a copy to enable them to timely make the proper entry to recognize Accounts Receivable [from PhilHealth] and Income from Hospital Fees.

13. 	Expired drugs and medicines amounting to ₱197,919.49 remained in the premises of the hospital as of December 31, 2020 and likewise was not dropped from the books of accounts, inconsistent with the guidelines stated in the Revised Health Care Waste Management of the DOH and the Government Accounting Manual, thus, posing an environmental risk and exposing the said expired medicines to misuse and accidental contamination or poisoning and overstating the Inventory Account as of year-end.

		We recommended that management adhere to the following measures:

		a) 	Fast tract the completion of the requested septic vault in order for the university hospital to hastily dispose of the expired drugs and medicines and other related items in the appropriate manner as provided for by the DOH guidelines; and

	b) 	Review the roles and responsibilities of each unit involved such that the identification, recognition and recording of expired/unserviceable drugs and medicines is done in accordance with the agency’s Supply and Property Management Manual and the related rules and regulations.

14. The Resource Generation and Management Office’s (RGMO) overall net loss of ₱12,479,911.82 for the period ended December 31, 2020 and the underperformance of some IGPs for the last five years could affect the objective of the University to fund its development needs.



We recommended that Management:



a)    Establish strict internal control particularly in the disbursement of RGMO funds;



b) 	Require the Project Heads to submit monthly and/or quarterly status reports and other pertinent reports necessary for the monitoring of each IGP’s performance to the VP for RGMO;



c) 	Require appropriate turnover of documents in case of transfer of Project Heads from one project to another to avoid displacement of IGPs; and



d) 	Reassess and evaluate the existing strategy employed by the RGMO to make each IGP reach its target especially on maximizing its revenue and minimize its expenses.





F.	STATUS OF SETTLEMENT OF ACCOUNTS



As of December 31, 2020, the Statement of Audit Suspension, Disallowances and Charges reflected a total balance of ₱2,364,641.78 and ₱3,854,656.43 for suspensions and disallowance, respectively.

Modified-Qualified Opinion



We have audited the financial statements of Central Mindanao University (CMU), which comprise the statement of financial position as at December 31, 2020, and the statement of financial performance, statement of changes in net assets/equity, statement of cash flows and statement of comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.  



In our opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the Basis of Modified-Qualified Opinion section of our report, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Central Mindanao University as at December 31, 2020, and its financial performance, its cash flows, and its comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs).



Basis for Modified Opinion



	The Auditor rendered a modified-qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements due to the following: (1) The existence, completeness and correctness of the balances of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) totaling ₱815,798,334.00 that could not be ascertained due to unreconciled PPE ledger accounts against the submitted Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE), (2) Failure of the Supply and Property Management Unit and the Accounting Unit to adhere to the proper monitoring, controlling and recording of acquisition and disposal of inventory contrary to Section 13 to 15, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs thus rendering the existence and accuracy of the reported balances of Inventory accounts totaling ₱79,487,706.72 as unreliable; and (3) Accuracy of the Account School Fees of Fund Cluster 5 (Special Trust Fund) as of December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱222,320,069.53 cannot be ascertained due to improper recording of Income Account from school fees reversal of Unearned Income and use of unreliable data as basis of adjustments.



We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the agency in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our modified-qualified opinion.



Key Audit Matters



Except for the matter described in the Basis for Modified-Qualified Opinion section, we have determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report.



Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements



Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with IPSASs, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.



Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the University’s financial reporting process.



Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements



Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

CENTRAL MINDANAO UNIVERSITY

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Cluster 01, 05, 06 and 07

As of December 31, 2020





1.  General Information/Agency Profile



The financial statements of Central Mindanao University were authorized for issue on December 31, 2020 as shown in the Statement of Management Responsibility for Financial Statements signed by Dr. Jesus Antonio G. Derije, the President of the University.



Central Mindanao University is a State University established on June 16, 1965 and operates under the authority of the Republic Act No. 4498. The mandate of Central Mindanao University is to provide programs of instruction at all levels in the arts, sciences, technical, professional, education and philosophical fields, and shall concern itself with pure and applied research in all branches of knowledge for the intellectual and professional growth of faculty members, for the advance instruction of students, particularly graduate students and for increasing knowledge and understanding. These services are grouped into the following key areas: instruction, research, extension and production. 

		

		The University, as Center of Excellence (COE) in Agriculture, Forestry, Veterinary Medicine and Biology  and Center of Development (COD) in Mathematics, Education and Environmental Science envisions to sustain its role as a vibrant and self-reliant center of excellence in instruction, research and extension in various fields of specialization; a strategic and dynamic partner of the government in building a nation of empowered, self-sufficient and culture sensitive people, and a production-committed University.

		

		Under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8292, the Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997, SUCs are authorized to deposit in any Authorized Government Depository Bank (AGDB) and treat as Special Trust Fund (STF), income from tuition fees and other necessary charges such as matriculation fees, graduation fees and laboratory fees. The law further authorized the Board of Regents/Trustees of SUCs to disburse such income and other charges, as well as those generated from the operation of auxiliary services and land grants, for instruction, research, extension or other programs/projects of the University or College.  Such disbursements require a special budget duly approved by the BOR/T which is now empowered by R.A. No. 8292 to appropriate the income of the University/College and allocate funds with flexibility.



Regarding its business type entities, the Business Management and Resources Development Office (BMRDO) and University Food and Lodging Services (UFLS) were created by virtue of Section 5-A of Republic Act No. 2273 dated June 19, 1959, which states among others that, “A revolving fund is hereby created out of the income of the college from the operation of its farms and other enterprises, except those accruing from tuition, matriculation, athletic and other fees required of students enrolling in the college, for the purpose of expanding and/or improving the college farms and farming activities.”



On April 2002 the Board of Regents approved the transfer of management of the University Food and Lodging Services (UFLS) and Continuing Education Center (CEC) from the Business Management and Resources Development Office (BMRDO) to the Office of the President.  The University Food and Lodging Services (UFLS) is one of the income-generating projects under Fund 161 – Revolving Fund.



The BMRDO and UFLS are now known as University Income Generating Program (UIGP) per Board Resolution No. 27, s. 2012.  The Agency’s registered office is located in Maramag, Bukidnon.

The University Income Generating Program (UIGP) was then renamed with University Resource Generation Management Office per approved Board Resolution No. 87, s. 2019.

     3.3  Inventories



Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition; the cost of the inventory is its fair value at the date of acquisition.



After initial recognition, inventory is measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. However, to the extent that a class of inventory is distributed or deployed at no charge or for a nominal charge, that class of inventory is measured at the lower of cost and current replacement cost.



Inventories are recognized as an expense when deployed for utilization or consumption in the ordinary course of operation of the Central Mindanao University.

     3.4  Property, Plant and Equipment



            Recognition



An item is recognized as property, plant and equipment (PPE) if it meets the characteristics and recognition criteria as a PPE.



The characteristics of PPE are as follows:



--	Tangible items

--	Are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes; and

--	Are expected to be used during more than one reporting period.



An item of PPE is recognized as an asset if:

--	It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to the entity; and

--	The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably.



Measurement at Recognition



An item recognized as property, plant and equipment is              measured at cost.



A PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction is measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition.



The cost of PPE is the cash price equivalent or, for PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction its cost is its fair value as at recognition date



Cost includes the following:



--	Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates;

--	Expenditures that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items; and

--	Initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired, or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that period.





Measurement After Recognition



After recognition, all property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.



When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Central Mindanao University recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major repair/replacement is done, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.



All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense in surplus or deficit as incurred.



Depreciation



Each part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately.



The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expense unless it is included in the cost of another asset.



Initial Recognition of Depreciation



Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.



 For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation is for one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month. However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, depreciation is for the succeeding month.



Depreciation Method



The straight line method of depreciation is adopted unless another method is more appropriate for agency operation.



Estimated Useful Life



The Central Mindanao University uses the Schedule on the Estimated Useful Life of PPE by classification prepared by COA.



The Central Mindanao University uses a residual value equivalent to at least five percent (5%) of the cost of the PPE.



Impairment



An assets’ carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount, or recoverable service amount, if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable service amount.



Derecognition



The Central Mindanao University derecognizes items of property, plant and equipment and/or any significant part of an asset upon disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected from its continuing use. Any gain or loss arising on Derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the surplus or deficit when the asset is derecognized.

For STF Fund Cluster 05, Accounts Receivable in the total amount of ₱69,387,387.50 is broken down as follows:





Account

Amount



Remarks



1) Buffalo/

Tamaraw/Limus farmers

₱2,207,850.00

This represents the receivables from the land rental of   the Buffalo/Tamaraw/Limus BTL) farmers way back in 2003-2007.  Below are the details of this receivable:



Per record, the BTL made its last payment of its obligation to the University in 2006.  In accordance to the tripartite agreement with CMU, BTL and then Cong. Miguel Zubiri.  Inspite of the notice from the University and the decision of the Board not to extend the agreement when it expired in 2007, the BTL groups continue to occupy, till and benefitted from the land of CMU and availed the services of the NIA irrigation without payment for such service and corresponding land rental.



From middle of 2008 until end of 2010 the University was placed under officers-in-charge designated by the Board.  This contributed much also to the land problem involving the BTL groups because not only that they did not settle their previous obligation but also expanded their occupied area and oftentimes resulting to confrontation with security personnel of the University.  The matter had become political when some personalities and entities coming in and got involved into the issue.  Still, the management reminded the BTL groups to settle their previous obligation to the University. (Letter of Dr. Barroso).



In December 2008, the BOR approved a proposed MOA for a Transitional Lease Agreement between CMU and the individual farmer-members of the BTL.  This was during the time of Dr. Malunhao as Officer-in-charge of the University.  This proposed MOA included a provision that a third party (Gov. Zubiri) shall ensure that the unpaid obligation of the BTL be settled first before the signing of the transitional lease agreement.  The agreement was supposed to bind individual farmers from paying its obligation directly to CMU rather than dealing with the organization as regard to their financial obligation.  However, this agreement was not realized and followed through due to changes in leadership (from Dr. Malunhao to Dr. Barroso to Dr. Soliven) and various political and legal interventions,   Further, the BTL groups strongly insisted on lease agreement with the organization rather than on individual member.



With the assumption of the new president on January 2011 the management attempted to resolve the issue with the BTL thru negotiation together with the LGU and other agencies of the government.  Different issues were raised including the unpaid obligation of the groups.  Unfortunately, both the University and BTL failed to come to terms, particularly on the land rental rate and the period of lease.  Consequently, to press the University to allow them to till the land the BTL staged a rally in front of the university main gate that lasted for days that posed a security problem to the management.  Outside political pressures were exerted to accommodate BTL groups.



Given the situation in the university at that time, the Board decided to issue a status qou order that allowed the BTL groups to continue tilling the land while the Board attempted to create a high level task force involving various national agencies of the government thru CHED.  The primary object was to find lasting solution.  Despite this, tensions rose from time to time at the field between the security personnel securing the University property and the informal settler groups.  The Office of the Solicitor General is currently preparing legal action against the informal settlers involved in the destruction of the University property.



The University remains committed to collect the amount due to the University.



2) Andrew Austral

113,977.29

This represents the balance of   Mr. Andrew for not completing the return service as CMU Faculty Development Program scholar.  He requested that his payments will be made by deducting 1.5% of the total gross amount from the   billings/voucher whenever he has transactions in the University since he was one of the suppliers of veterinary products. In 2017, deduction from the gross payment of Mr. Austral’s was increased to 5%, thus he was able to pay the total of ₱5,428.14 from his transactions in the University. In 2019, Mr. Austral had only one business transaction with the University in the gross amount of ₱900.00 only, thus we were not able to collect any amount from him.;

4) Students on AWOL

42,506.00

This represents the amount collectible from students who stopped schooling without securing clearances.

The reports were submitted to COA with proper supporting documents such as necropsy report from the Veterinarian. The value of the loss was charged against the liable person in-charge of the project until the necessary supporting documents for the grant of relief of accountability will be received by the Accounting Office for reversion of such accountability. Furthermore, the subsequent reports of the damaged standing crop (cassava) was declared as over aged and it was already inspected and submitted to the COA for further investigation and reconsideration or relief of accountability of the person in-charge.

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE REPORT





A)		Financial and Compliance





1. Trial Balances are submitted without the supporting schedules in violation of Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, thus, the conduct of prompt verification of accounts and financial transactions as well as the early detection and correction of errors/deficiencies, if any, cannot be made.



Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, provides the deadline for submission of reports as follows: 



“Deadlines on Submission of Reports. All NGAs shall prepare and submit the following financial statements and schedules as follows, within the prescribed deadline:



c. Central/Head/Main Officers

COA Auditor, DBM, COA-GAS



Records of this Office showed that everytime the Accounting Section submitted the trial balance of the Agency, these were not supported with the necessary schedules innumerated in Section 60, Chapter 19 of the GAM which deficiency was already conveyed to them.  



Moreover, the Accounting Section has not yet transitioned to eNGAs system and still maintained the manual recording and monitoring of transactions which contributed in the difficulty and delay in generating supporting schedules. 

   

Non-submission of the supporting schedules hindered the auditorial review and verification on a timely basis, thus, deterred early detection and correction of errors and deficiencies. 



We recommended that management require the Accountant to submit trial balances with complete supporting schedules within the prescribed deadline set for the submission of the reports and documents to the Office of the Auditor as required under Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. 



Management Comments:

	

	The management committed to adhere to the recommendation for the submission of the Trial Balances with complete supporting schedules within the prescribed deadline set for the submission of the reports and documents to the office of the Auditor as required under Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs effective in AY 2021.





Infrastructure Projects



2.	Management failed to furnish the Audit Team copies of Contract Variation Orders such as the Change Orders/Extra Work Orders and Time Extension Documents contrary to the provisions in COA Circular 2009-001 and COA Memorandum 2005-027 on the submission of copy of government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents to the Office of the Auditor thus, the legality, validity and reasonableness of the said documents cannot be ascertained.

Prior to COA Circular 2009-001, COA Memorandum 2005-027 was issued wherein   Section III of the said memo stated that ‘the documentary requirements for all types of technical evaluations covered by this memorandum are contained in the attached Annexes A-T.’

COA Circular 2009-001 subsequently retained the attachment of Annex A-T which included among others the following:

		--			Annex B - CHECKLIST FOR TECHNICAL EVALUATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE CONTRACT VARIATION ORDERS

		--			Annex E - 	CHECKLIST FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS and CONSULTING SERVICES TIME EXTENSION EVALUATION



Section 3 of the same circular covers the guidelines in the Submission and Review Process of contracts. Sec. 3.1 states that ‘Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned. In case of agencies audited on an engagement basis, submission of a copy of the contract and its supporting documents shall be to the Auditor of the mother agency or parent company, as the case may be.’



Furthermore, it provided in Sec. 3.1.7 that ‘The procedures and timelines herein outlined shall also apply to supplementary contracts, variation orders and the like.’

Evaluation of the documents submitted by management during the year showed that they failed to submit the Documentary Requirements listed under Annexes B and E of COA Circular 2009-001.

Thus, technical evaluation of the said variation orders were delayed and corrections cannot be promptly made.

We recommended that management submit immediately all Variation Orders and Time Extensions incurred and approved during the CY 2020 and other supporting documents based on the checklist required by the Annexes B & E of COA Circular 2009-001 and henceforth, adhere to the above provisions for a timely conduct of the required evaluation.



Management Comments:



	The management commented that the audit observation memorandum will serve as a lesson and committed to comply on the submission of all approved variation orders and time extensions to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed period.





3. The University failed to submit the documentary requirements for the grant of relief from accountability for the death of various livestock totaling ₱1,403,232.36 as of November 30, 2020, P 818,966.99 of which have questionable specific stewards in violation to Section 3c.4, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of GAM for NGAs and COA Memorandum No. 92-751 dated February 24, 1992  resulting to inefficiency in the handling of government property and overstatement of assets thus, financial statements are not fairly presented.



Section 3c, Chapter 2, Volume I of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies states that



“When a loss of government funds or property occurs while they are in transit or the loss is caused by fire, theft, or other casualty or force majeure, the officer accountable therefor or having custody thereof shall immediately notify the Commission or the auditor concerned and, within 30 days or such longer period as the Commission or auditor may in the particular case allow, shall present his application for relief, with the available supporting evidence. Whenever warranted by the evidence, credit for the loss shall be allowed. An officer who fails to comply with this requirement shall not be relieved of liability or allowed credit for any loss in the settlement of his accounts.” (Sec. 73, P.D. No. 1445)



COA Memorandum No. 92-751 dated February 24, 1992 enumerates the list of documents to be submitted for the Requests for Relief from Accountability which was already disseminated to the University’s Project Heads/Farm Foremen, Veterinarians and their support staff.



Accordingly, Section 104, Chapter 5 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 states that failure of the agency head to exercise the diligence of a good father of a family in supervising accountable officers under his control to prevent the incurrence of loss of government funds or property, he shall be jointly and solidarily liable with the person primarily accountable therefor.

On September 30, 2020, the audit team conducted a briefing to all Property Custodians, Veterinarians, and their support staff regarding the submission of documentary requirements for the Requests for Relief from Accountability within the 30-day reglementary period.  It can be gleaned based on Table 2 that the concerned officers failed to observed the prescribed period of submission. 



One of the major reasons of the undue delay in the submission of requests for relief from accountability (Refer to Table 2) was the non-submission of necropsy reports by the Veterinarians despite several follow ups. Similarly, non-submission of applicable documents for the settlement of damaged crops by the Project Heads under Crops Enterprise Office precluded in the immediate settlement of outstanding accountabilities (Refer to Table 1). Also, fast rotation of employees without proper turnover of documents and responsibilities contributed in the aggravation of the matter. Preceding causes resulted in the delay of the settlement of accounts (accumulation of backlogs) and consistent delays in the disposition/resolution of the applications for relief from accountability which eventually increased the balance of “Due from Officers and Employees” account



We recommended that Management:



a)	Require the Veterinarians to provide the necropsy reports of the dead animals within   15 days from receipt hereof or we will be constrained to disallow the amounts;



b)	Require all the Project Heads to submit the requests for relief from accountability with   the documentary requirements as required by COA Memorandum No. 92-751 dated February 24, 1992 (Refer to Table 2);

c)	Require the Accountant and all the Project Heads to fast track the settlement of    outstanding accountabilities immediately;



d)	Require the Project Head under the Dairy Project to submit satisfactory explanation detailing the absence of negligence regarding the death of the animal with ear tag no. 246-G19*;



e)	In case government properties are transferred from one Project Head to another, or from an outgoing personnel to his successor, require the Directors of Livestock Enterprise Office and Crops Enterprise Office to implement strict and appropriate turnover of responsibilities among the Project Heads to avoid destabilization of each project unit; and



f)	Hereafter, strictly observe the reglementary period in the submission of relief from accountabilities to avoid suspensions/disallowances.		



Management Comments:



The management committed to closely coordinate with the Project Heads to fast track the settlement of outstanding accountabilities. With regards to the mortalities of various livestock (goat/sheep) that were not recorded in the books, the Accounting Office already made the journal entries necessary for the dropping of several dead goats and sheep. The office made the essential effort to secure the documentary requirements from the proper officials to draw the adjustments in Cluster 6. Upon attainment of the documentary requirements, the bookkeeper adjusted the original entry made in Cluster 6 about the derecognition of goats/sheep. Thereafter, forwarded the documentary requirements to the Cluster 5 bookkeeper to draw the journal entries for the transfer of the said goats/sheep, as well as the setting up of accountabilities for the mortalities and the granting of relief of accountability. These were all drawn in the Cluster 5 in December 2020. The assigned Director had partially called the attention of previous project managers listed on the said AOM and were required to submit a one-page explanation regarding their outstanding accountabilities. The Director further committed to coordinate with other offices such as supplies office for necessary supporting documents and to the accounting office for verification of the necessary adjustments on their books for dropping of dead working animals and other inventories due from the listed accountable employees. 





4. Several mortalities of various livestock were not recorded in the books of the agency contrary to Section 6, Chapter 19, Volume 1 and Chapter 3, Volume III of GAM for NGAs hence understated the “Due from Officers and Employees Account” by ₱29,310.00.



Section 6, Chapter 19, Volume 1 of GAM for NGAs states that the information in financial statements should be completed within the bounds of materiality and cost.



Chapter 3, Volume III of GAM for NGAs provides for the recognition of amount of claims from agency's officers and employees for overpayment (not covered by ND), cash shortage, loss of assets and other bills issued by the agency in the Due from Officers and Employees Account.

Inquiry disclosed that these goat/sheep were derecognized from the books of the agency – Cluster 6 on March 31, 2020 as a Debit to Accumulated Surplus/Deficit and a Credit to Breeding Stock and Livestock for being “transferred to other fund” per record of the agency.  These animals, being used for research and instruction program of the University, would be more appropriately be recorded in Cluster 5-STF 164, however as of December 30, 2020, the transfer was not yet recorded pending instruction from the Management.



Non recording of both the mortality of these animals’ subject to relief from accountability, and the transfer of the goat/sheep from Cluster 6 understated the Due from Officers and Employees account of the University and the Breeding Stocks respectively.



We recommended that Management require the bookkeeper to draw a journal voucher to transfer the recording of the animals from Cluster 6 to Cluster 5 – STF 164. Moreover, submit the documentary requirements for the grant of relief for the dead animals within 15 days from receipt of this report.  



Management Comments:



		The Accounting Unit has already coordinated with the Livestock Head/In-charge to secure the needed documents for the dropping of livestock stated in Table 3 and for the setting up of accountability in the books.

                            



5. Discrepancies were noted in the recording and monitoring of livestock of the University contrary to Section 21, Chapter 5, Volume 1 of GAM for NGAs and Section 5 of General Appropriations Act of CY 2020 resulting to the understatement of the related asset account by at least ₱3,623,075.00. 



Section 21, Chapter 5, Volume 1 of GAM for NGAs states that an entity shall recognize an asset in respect of transfers when the transferred resources meet the definition of an asset and satisfy the criteria for recognition as an asset. Transfers include grants, debt forgiveness, fines, bequests, gifts, donations and goods and services in-kind. 

Measurement of Transferred Assets. Transferred assets are measured at their fair value as at the date of acquisition. (Par. 83, PPSAS 23)

Section 5 of General Appropriations Act of CY 2020 provides that…



“Receipts from donations, whether in cash or in kind, shall be accounted for in the books of the donee-government agency in accordance with accounting and auditing rules and regulations.”

Verification disclosed that the goat and sheep shown in Table 2 were derecognized from the books of the agency – Cluster 6 on March 31, 2020 with a Debit to Accumulated Surplus/Deficit and a Credit to Breeding Stock and Livestock for being “transferred to other fund” as reflected in the accounting entry.  These animals, being used in the research and instruction program of the university, the most appropriate fund to record the transfer would have been Cluster 5 – STF 164. As of present, the corresponding entry to record transferred livestock was not yet recorded in any fund pending instruction from the Management.



Table 1 also showed twenty-five (25) animals from National Dairy Authority (NDA) which remained unrecorded in the books of the agency. In 2012, Central Mindanao University entered into an agreement with NDA for the “Dairy Multiplier Farm Program” – Standard Payment-in-Kind Scheme whereby the NDA lends to eligible co-operator imported mature, female dairy animals, payable in eight (8) years which was already due on July 25, 2020. Based on the Statement of Account (SOA) provided by NDA, the University has already paid a total of ₱2,159,787.50 from the proceeds of culled animals and payment-in-kind as of December 31, 2020.



Similarly, ten (10) heifers, one (1) bull and three (3) horses were also found during the audit team’s ocular inspection at the premises of the Beef & Cattle Project on January 8, 2021. The University has already incurred several expenses to maintain the proper care of these animals such as trucking cost, provision of quality feeds and roughage, mineral supplements, construction of barns and wages of caretakers despite the absence of complete documents to show ownership.  



Inquiries made by the audit team from the staff in the Beef and Cattle Project, Accounting Office and Office of the Vice President for RGMO revealed that there were no available documents pertaining to the acquisition of these animals e.g. deed of donation (if acquired through donation) hence, not reported in the monthly inventory report of the Beef & Cattle Project and Livestock Schedule of the Accounting Office, respectively.  With the prevailing situation, ownership by the University on these subject livestock is not ascertained as well as non-recording of these livestock in the book of the agency understated the related asset account.



We recommended that management:



a)	Secure and submit to the audit team the documents like deed of donation for their acquisition;



b)	Require the Accounting Unit to secure reference of fair values or appraisal by a member of the valuation profession;

c)	Require the Accountant to instruct the respective bookkeepers to record these livestock in the appropriate books of accounts supported with complete & proper documents; and



d)	Henceforth, secure proper documentary requirements prior to acceptance and delivery of any livestock from any government agencies and/or private entities in the future.



Management Comments:



The management has already conducted series of follow-ups to the concerned personnel regarding the needed documents for the recording of the various livestock/working animals in the books. The office has already drawn journal entries for the transfer of goats and sheep from Cluster 6 to Cluster 5. Also, recognition of the goats under MINSSAD Goat Project was drawn. All the same, the office committed to closely coordinate with the Project In-charge to secure the needed documentary requirements in support to the recording of the livestock which are still unrecorded in the books.





6.	Disbursements for Collective Negotiation Allowance in the amount of ₱22,280,792.23 for CY 2019 and ₱8,672,089.4 for CY 2020 were not supported with sufficient and relevant documents contrary the Item 6, Section 4 of PD No. 1445, Item 5.6 of COA Circular 2012-01 and existing DBM guidelines, thus validity of the transaction could not be ascertained. Moreover, recording also of the allowance was not in accordance to DBM BC 2019-5 and 2020-5 issued on November 7, 2019.



One of the fundamental principles governing the financial transactions and operations of any government agency under Item 6, Section 4 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 is claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.

Further, COA Circular No. 2012-001, dated June 14, 2012, prescribing the revised guidelines and documentary requirements for common government transactions has enumerated the required supporting documents for the grant of Collective Negotiation Agreement under Item 5.6, to wit:

--	Resolution signed by both parties incorporating the guidelines/criteria in granting CAN

--	Comparative statement of DBM approved level of operating expenses and actual operating expenses

--	Proof of remittance to the National Treasury of its 50 percent dividends share or percentage approved by the Department of Finance on the annual earnings for income –generating GOCCs/GFIs

--	Copy of CAN

--	Certificate issued by the Head of Agency on the total amount of unencumbered savings generated from cost-cutting measures identified in the CNA which resulted from the joint efforts of labor and management and systems/productivity/income improvement

--	Proof that the planned programs/activities/projects have been implemented and completed in accordance with targets for the year

The Department of Budget and Management has prescribed the guidelines on the grant of the Collective Negotiation Agreement Incentive thru Budget Circular No. 2019-5 Budget Circular No. 2020-5 for calendar year 2019 and 2020 respectively. Under Item 1.3 of both circulars, the grant of the CNA incentive sourced from the allowable MOOE allotments is subject to the following:

(a) There is a valid CNA executed between the agency and the recognized employee organization which includes a provision on cost-cutting measures to be undertaken collectively by the agency and its personnel;

(b) The one-time annual payment of CNA Incentive shall be made through written resolution signed by agency representatives from both labor and management, and approved by the agency head;

(c) The CNA Incentive that may be granted shall be limited to the amount determine by the DBM; and 

(d) The use of MOOE for the payment of CNA Incentive shall be subject to approval by the agency head and made only during the validity of the appropriation.  Any excess amounts therefrom after payment of the CNA Incentive shall revert to the General Fund.

Both circulars emphasized the requirement of target accomplishments of at least an average of 70% of all the targets for all the organizational outcomes/performance indicators under their respective annual budget approved by Congress. However, for CY 2020, DBM cited that the accomplishment of at least 70% of the targets is without prejudice to the exclusion of those targets/outputs critically affected by the imposed restrictions/limitations due to the COVID-19. 

Section 4.1.3 of both circulars requires the national government agencies to submit to DBM their respective accountability reports as of September 30, pursuant to COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2014-1, as amended by COA-DBM JC No. 2019-1.

For the fund sources of the CNA Incentive, the circulars provide that it shall be solely from the available balances of allowable MOOE allotments and that the same become available as a result of cost-cutting and systems improvement measures undertaken collectively by the agency and its personnel, as identified in their respective CNA. 

Each NGA and SUC shall submit to the DBM’s Budget and Management Bureau or Regional Office concerned not later than January 31of the following year, the annual report on the grant of the CNA Incentive by following the template attached as Annex “A” 

In CY 2019 and 2020, the University has granted the CNA Incentive to its personnel in the total amount of ₱22,280,792.23 and ₱8,672,089.47, respectively.

Non submission of the documentary required by the specific COA Circular and DBM Budget Circulars has put the validity of the said disbursement in question and the Agency Head and the accountable officers can be held liable for not adhering to the guidelines in the payment of the CNA Incentive.

We recommended that management: 

a)	Submit the following documentary requirements for CNA Incentives granted in CY 2019 and CY 2020 or we will be constrained to disallow all payments on CNA, to wit:

--	Resolution signed by both parties incorporating the guidelines/criteria in granting CNA;

--	Comparative statement of DBM approved level of operating expenses and actual operating expenses;

--	Certificate issued by the Head of Agency on the total amount of unencumbered savings generated from cost-cutting measures identified in the CNA which resulted from the joint efforts of labor and management and systems/productivity/income improvement;

--	Proof that the planned programs/activities/projects have been implemented and completed in accordance with targets for the year;

--	Savings generated from the allowable MOOE allotments (emphasis ours);

--	Copy of the accountability report submitted to the DBM as of September 30 of each year the CNA was granted;

--	Copy of Annex A duly received by the DBM’s Budget and Management Bureau or Regional Office; and

--	Copy of the Board of Regents’ approved resolution on the use of savings for the payment of CNA Incentive, if necessary; and



b)	Henceforth, prepare and provide the documentary requirements for the CNA Incentive before releasing them.

Management Comments:



	Management commented that upon payroll preparation and payment of CNA Incentives, the payroll in-charge had only attached the list of grantees, circular, and joint resolution as supporting documents and unintentionally overlooked to attach the other necessary supporting documents. Be it know that before the payroll preparation of the CNA Incentives, all the needed documents for the grant of CNA Incentives were duly constituted and fulfilled as required by law. Further, all documentary requirements for CNA Incentives granted in CY 2019 and CY 2020 were already submitted to the Office of the Auditor before the specified deadline in the AOM.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



Initial verification on the submitted document disclosed the absence of the required Report of the Payment of CNA Incentive marked as Annex A of the subject DBM Budget Circular and the observed deficiency on the target set by the existing regulation. Compliance and justification is requested.

	

7. 	The University granted Collective Negotiation Agreement Incentive in the amount of ₱985,000.00 to Contract of Service personnel contrary to Section 4 of PD 1445, Item 3 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2019-5, dated November 7, 2019 thus regularity of the transaction is in question.

Item 7, Section 4 of the Presidential Decree No. 1445 reminds the government agencies that financial transactions and operation of their office that all laws and regulations applicable to financial transactions shall be faithfully adhered to.

In November 7, 2019, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) issued Budget Circular No. 2019-5 setting the guidelines on the Grant of Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) Incentive for FY 2019.

The Circular, in Item 3, identified the qualified personnel which covers the civilian occupying regular, contractual, or casual positions rendering services on full-time or part time basis in national government agencies (NGAs), including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy, SUCs, GOCCs, LWDs, and LGUs, whether or not covered by RA No. 6758.

In the post audit of disbursement pertaining on the payment of the CNA Incentive for CY 2019 covered with DV No. 2019-12-1000 with the amount of ₱21,954,367.80 and DV No. 2019-12-10348 with the amount of ₱326,424.43, it was discovered that personnel hired thru Contract of Service (COS) were included in the payment of incentive totaling ₱985,000.00 (Appendices A & B). 

The COS personnel are not covered by the DBM Budget Circular, thus their inclusion in the payroll and the subsequent released of the amount corresponding to the total amount they received is irregular.  

We recommended that management require the COS personnel who received the CNA Incentive to refund within 90 days from the date of this observation or require the personnel who signed the DVs to pay the amount and henceforth adhere to the guidelines to be issued by DBM for the grant of CNA Incentive.

Management Comments:



	The management already communicated to CMUFAI and all COS personnel the COA recommendation requiring the return of CNA from all COS personnel. However, the management requested for a kind consideration for the COS not to refund or the personnel who signed the DVs not to pay for humanitarian reasons and that they are indeed in good faith when they received or released the CNA Incentive for there was a mistake of fact or a difficult question of law committed and/or faced on the part of the joint committee who formulated the CNA Agreement and Guidelines. Nevertheless, we have already transmitted the Notice of Suspension to each COS Faculty affected and currently waiting for their responses regarding this matter.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Civil Service Commission in their Resolution No. 020790, dated June 5, 2002 Re: Policy Guidelines for Contract of Services described the employment of Individual Contract of Services/ Job Order described as follows: “1. The contract covers lump sum work or services such as janitorial, security, or consultancy where no employer- employee relationship exists between the individual and the government; 2. The job order covers piece work or intermittent job of short duration not exceeding six months and pay is on a daily basis; 3. The contract of services and job order are not covered by Civil Service law, rules and regulations, but covered by Commission on Audit (COA) rules; 4. The employees involved in the contract or job order do not enjoy the benefits enjoyed by government employees, such as PERA, ACA and RATA. 5. Services rendered thereunder are not considered as government service.”  



 While we recognized the contribution in the attainment of the University’s goals and objectives made by the subject part time personnel hired thru Contract of Service, we stand with our recommendation for the refund of CNA Incentive granted to them for being not qualified under Item 3 of the DBM Budget Circular.   The subject personnel received the CNA Incentive without valid basis or justification and that they benefited at the expense of the government which is against the principle of unjust enrichment under Article 22 of the Civil Code.		





8. 	Accuracy of the account School Fees of Fund Cluster 5 (Special Trust Fund) as of December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱222,320,069.53 cannot be ascertained due to improper recording of Income Account from school fees reversal of Unearned Income and use of unreliable data as basis of adjustments contrary to COA CL 2004-002 thus, casting doubts on the accuracy and fairness of presentation of the financial statements. 



	COA Circular Letter 2004-002 dated September 30, 2004 provides the Accounting Guidelines and Procedures on the Proper Recording of Income from Tuition Fees of State Universities and Colleges (SUCs). 



Section 2.1 thereof provides that the accrual method of accounting shall be used in recording income from tuition fees and it shall be recorded in the Regular Agency (RA) Book. Based on the final assessment of students upon enrollment, the Accounting Unit shall record the “Accounts Receivable” with the corresponding credit to income account “Tuition Fees/School Fees”.



Query from the accounting office personnel revealed that the accrual method of accounting to record the income from tuition fees was not adhered. Verification of the subsidiary ledger for the account School Fees disclosed that no credit entry was drawn to recognized income based on the billing statement sent to CHED for the tuition fees and other miscellaneous fees of the student under RA No.10931 or the "Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act" program of the government.  The income was only recognized upon actual collection either from CHED or from payments by students through the Collecting Officers for their previous accounts.



Further verification of the SL showed inclusion of debit entries for adjustments to Account Receivables and credit entries for adjustment on Deferred Income account previously recorded in December 2019 aside from the collections and refunds to students during the year as shown in Appendix C.  The accounting office used the balance of the Accounts Receivable generated from the MIS Enrollment System in drawing the debit entries to the SL for School Fees.  The debit entries, tend to decrease the income from School Fees, and is not reliable due to the question on inconsistency in the balance of the Receivable Account generated from the MIS enrollment system not to mention that the entries made has no bearing to the account because the cash basis is used in the recognition of the income from school fee. A credit adjustment for deferred income, previously recognized in December 2019 is not proper since the school fees recorded and collected during that year was already earned during that year, therefore, can increase the School Fees account.



The effect of these entries resulted in the increase in the School Fees account in CY 2020 by ₱112,684,496.19 account as shown in the table below.

Such method of recording the School Fees has already been the practice of the bookkeeper since that is the one turned-over to him upon his assumption. Even with the knowledge that the MIS Enrollment System does not generate accurate AR balances, the management still continue using this because accordingly there are no other data source for the students’ AR balances. 



Not adhering to the prescribed accounting policy on the proper recognition of school fees and the erroneous use of data as basis of the recording of the appropriate accounting entries cast doubts on the accuracy of the year-end balance of the School Fees account as well as the fairness of presentation of the income account in the financial statements.



We recommended that management require:		



a)	The accounting unit should strictly comply with the Accounting Guidelines and Procedures on the Proper Recording of Income from Tuition Fees of State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) set under COA CL 2004-002;



b) 	Use the total assessment of all enrollees for every semester as basis in setting Accounts Receivable and School Fees and not the MIS Enrollment System generated balance; and



c)	Prepare the necessary adjusting entri/es to reflect the correct balance of the account School Fees for CY 2020.



Management Comments:

	The management commented that the Accounting Unit is strictly following Accrual Basis of Accounting. As presented in the Subsidiary Ledger of School Fees, there were recorded Account Receivable and School Fees at the end of the month of enrolment to reflect the true accountabilities of the Students regardless of who will pay it or when will it be paid. However, a discrepancy was identified due to inaccurate report of Account Receivable generated by the Enrollment System, thus, resulted to inaccurate reporting of Receivable. The Accounting Unit will make a manual monitoring of Students Accountabilities based on the Total Assessment per Semester to reflect the correct Account Receivable pending the upgrading of the Enrolment System to correct the reports. Once the verification of individual student’s accountabilities is done, the Accounting Unit will make the necessary adjusting entries. 



9. 	Reliability of the balances of the Cash-in-Bank-Local Currency Account in the total amount of ₱488,194,750.24 could not be ascertained in view of the variance of ₱88,861,665.91 between the book and bank records due to accounting office’s failure to submit the Bank Reconciliation Statement contrary to Section 74 of PD 1445 and Section 5 to 7 of Chapter 21 GAM Volume 1.

Section 74 of Presidential Decree No. 1445, also known as the Government Audit Code of the Philippines states that at the close of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition of the agency account standing on their books.  The head of the Agency shall see to it that a reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the reports and the balance found in the books of the agency.”

Section 5 of Chapter 21 of GAM for NGAs. Preparation of the Bank Reconciliation Statement. The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the GSB, reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the BRS in four copies.



Section 6. Recognition of Adjustments. The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall prepare a JEV to recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the books of accounts.



Section 7. Reporting. The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty days after receipt of the monthly BS to the Auditor will all the supporting documents and JEVs.

Review and analysis of the Cash-in-Bank-LCCA and Cash-Modified Disbursement System (MDS), Regular accounts (with Land Bank of the Philippines) of the agency disclosed a variance of ₱88,861,665.91 between the book and bank records as of December 31, 2020 as shown in the table below:

Review on the BRS based on latest submission by management disclosed that the variance can be attributed to outstanding checks which includes issuance as far as two years ago, unrecorded deposits and errors.

Records of this office showed that the accounting office is not adhering to the requirement on submission of the Bank Reconciliation Statement as prescribed by the manual. The delay in submission also caused delay in the finalization of the cash examination conducted this year.   Several follow ups were made by the audit team however, timely submission of the BRS were not given preferential attention.  As of December 31, 2020, the management’s compliance on the submission of the BRS is summarized in the table below:

Failure of the accounting office to submit the required monthly BRS preclude both the audit team and the accounting office to check the correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s/entity’s records and provide the management with the basis for corrections for the reconciliation of the agency’s and bank’s records. Non-submission of the BRS for the period December 31, 2020, including those before that cast doubts on the accuracy and fairness of presentation of the cash in bank in the Financial Statement at year end. 

We recommended that management require the accountant to:

1)	Prepare the necessary adjusting entries for the various reconciling items to reflect the correct amount of cash in bank balance;

2)	Submit the required lacking Bank Reconciliation Statement for CY 2020 within 30 days from receipt of this report; and

3)	Henceforth, observe timely submission of the BRS and conduct regular adjusting entries on reconciling items as prescribed by the existing rules and regulations.

Management Comments:

	The management has submitted a file for the summary of submission of the BRSs for the different bank accounts of the University. Nonetheless, we will submit another set of BRSs for the month/s that were reported as lacking. With regards to the Account I and STF BRSs, the Accounting office was not able to submit these accounts’ BRSs in time for upon review of the CY 2019 BRSs submitted, there are necessary items that need to be adjusted to correct the cash in bank balance in the Financial Statements. This office exhausted all means and made every effort to correct the BRSs from CY 2019 in order to have a corrected BRS for the CY 2020. For the CMU EPP account and as per inquiry to the Bank Reconciliation In-charge, she is still verifying and constantly coordinating with the Cashier’s Unit In-charge for the needed supporting documents to properly reconcile the cash balance. Rest assured that we are doubling our time to finish all the corrections and verification, and we commit to submit the lacking BRSs at the soonest time possible. Furthermore, we will do our very best to comply with the timely submission of the BRS and conduct regular adjusting entries on reconciling items.



	10. Construction of the Bunkhouse by administration was done without the necessary documents nor can it be found as project in the APP or PPMP in violation of Section 8, Chapter 10 of the GAM and Section 4 of PD 1445, thus, asset and expenses were understated.

Section 8(g), Chapter 10 (Property, Plant and Equipment), Volume 1 of the GAM provides that if the project is to be constructed by administration, the procurement of labor and materials shall be in compliance with the provisions of R.A. No. 9184 and its Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations.

		Section 4 of PD 1445 provides the fundamental principles governing the financial transactions and operations of any government agency. The related principles are stated below, to wit:

	4.	Fiscal responsibility shall, to the greatest extent, be shared by all those exercising authority over the financial affairs, transactions, and operations of the government agency.

	

	5. 	Disbursements or disposition of government funds or property shall invariably bear the approval of the proper officials.

	

	8.	Generally accepted principles and practices of accounting as well as of sound management and fiscal administration shall be observed, provided that they do not contravene existing laws and regulations.

		Examination of the available documents submitted to this Office yielded the following observations and management’s initial response, respectively, regarding the project ‘Proposed Bunkhouse’ at Cagayan de Oro (see Appendix D for pictures) with a cost of ₱425,000.00 per Bill of Materials and Cost Estimates, to wit:

		(a) The APP and PPMP for CY 2020 does not reflect the project ‘Proposed Bunkhouse’. Likewise, the said project was not listed in the report submitted for the 4th Quarter 2020. Upon request, a revised RGPPA was presented containing the said project which was funded under the RGMO as stated. However, examination of the 2020 Business plan likewise does not identify the aforementioned specific project.

		

		Per documents provided to this office, the purpose of the construction of the said structure is to avoid further encroachment on the property. Below is an excerpt of the letter request made by the UPDO Director to the University President dated August 12, 2020, to quote:

		“Concerning to the above condition, to avoid further encroachment, may I request for an immediate construction of a bunkhouse or any structure for use by the university that would serve any purpose so as not to appear that the area is idle.”

		(b) The books of accounts of the RGMO and other Funds does not show Construction-in-Progress transactions related to the project ‘Proposed Bunkhouse’.

		

		Inquiry with the accounting unit disclosed that their office had no initial or prior information regarding the project ‘Proposed Bunkhouse.’ As stated, no Program of Works was initially submitted to them that could have aided in the proper recording of the said project.

		

		(c) Since the project was done by administration, all disbursements relating to the construction of the ‘Proposed Bunkhouse’ were assumed to be charged outright to MOOE.

		

		(d) Delivery Slips for lumber to be used in the proposed bunkhouse amounting to ₱97,000.00 were obtained from the Forest Resources Development Division but the same has not been recorded in the books of accounts as of Dec. 31, 2020.

		

		Per discussion with the FRDD personnel, it was learned that the reason for the non-recording of the said transaction in the books is that the FRDD was not able to submit the supporting documents to the accounting unit because the former cannot determine which unit or fund will the items be charged since no Purchase Request and/or Purchase Order was submitted to them prior to the release of the lumber products.

		

		In view of the above circumstances, the existence of the bunkhouse is questionable and rendered the project irregular in view of its non-inclusion in the PPMP and APP.

		

We recommended that management submit all the documents within 20 days from receipt of this report or we will disallow the construction of the bunkhouse.

Management Comments:



		Management commented that the construction of bunkhouse by administration was made for the main reason to save the property for further encroachment. Moreover, the delivery slips of lumber which were obtained from FRDD are for monitoring purposes as the materials used for the said project were derived from savings and recycled materials. Management also assured that all incoming projects of the University will go through the proper accounting and auditing procedures.





11. The balance of the Office Supplies Inventory as of December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱8,230,914.07 was unreliable due to improper accounting treatment of the payments to PS-DBM contrary to Section 111 of PD 1445, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1 and Chapter 3, Volume III of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, thus resulting to overstatement of the inventory account and understatement of the receivable account. 



Section 111 of P.D. 1445 provides that the accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government and the highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. 



Chapter 3, Volume III of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies also provides that the Due from National Government Agencies account is used to record advances for purchase of goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers to the NGAs for implementation of projects and other receivables from NGAs. This account is credited upon receipt of goods/services, liquidation of fund transfers, receipt of payment, settlement, write-off, and/or adjustments. 



Section 13 Chapter 6 Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides the illustrative accounting entry for the advance payment to PS-DBM as follows: 

		

	Due from NGAs 				10303010		₱ XX			Cash-Modified Disbursement 	10104040		          XX		System (MDS), Regular	

	

Then upon delivery, the Accounting Unit draw a JEV as follows:



	Merchandise Inventory						₱ XX			Due from NGAs		 				          XX			

Upon review it was observed that the said suggested entry was not followed by the accounting unit in recording the payments transferred to PS-DBM. Instead the bookkeepers for fund cluster 1, 5 and 6 recognized immediately the Office Supplies Inventory and for fund cluster 7 or the Account I, Due to NGAs is debited upon payment, closing the liability account from the funding agencies. 



During the year, CMU transferred to PS-DBM the amount of ₱ 3,975,310.6 for purchases of different commonly-used office supplies on all funds. However, of this amount, only ₱2,120,973.43 was delivered as per status report submitted by the Supply and Property Management Unit, a difference of ₱ 1,854,337.22. (see Appendix E)



Inquiry from the bookkeepers disclosed that the accounting treatment for recording the payment to PS-DBM has been their practice for they have assumed that upon release of the checks to PS-DBM the supplies will be also delivered immediately. They have no knowledge of the delivery of the supplies inventory since the delivery receipts are not submitted to them by the SPMU. 



The improper accounting treatment of the payments to PS-DBM has resulted in the overstatement of the Merchandise Inventory Account and understatement of the Due from NGAs account for December 31, 2020. 





We recommended that management require the accountant to: 



a)	Draw a journal entry voucher for those payments and be consistent in using the suggested accounting entry for purchases from PS DBM.  Establish the cost of undelivered items and record a receivable from the PS DBM;



b)	Require the SPMU to submit to the accounting unit the delivery receipts of PS-DBM and the Official Receipt as basis for crediting the Due from NGAs – PS-DBM account;



c)	Require the Property Officer, among others, to continue close coordination with PS-DBM to expedite deliveries of the undelivered office supplies and if otherwise initiate a request for refund to PS-DBM for the said supplies; and



d)	Require the accounting unit and SPMU to reconcile their respective records at least quarterly to ensure a correct balance of the Due from NGAs – PS-DBM and related account.



Management Comments:



	The management committed to adhere to the recommendation in using the suggested accounting entry for the purchases from PS-DBM which is to establish the cost of undelivered items and recognize receivable from the PS-DBM effective this CY 2021. Also, the Accounting Office will coordinate with the SPMU for the needed supporting documents for the crediting of the receivable account from PS-DBM upon delivery of the items purchased. SPMU also committed to submit to the Cashier’s Office the completed transactions with attached Disbursement Voucher, APR (CMU), Price Quotation and Stocks Availability Certification (DBM), Official Receipt, Delivery Receipts, and Inspection and Acceptance Report of PS-DBM account for forwarding to the Accounting Office for proper recording of Due from NGAs-PS-DBM account. To date, SPMU continues its monitoring/facilitating the undelivered items from PS-DBM. Reconciling is underway with Accounting Office for Due from NGAs-PS-DBM.





12. 	The existence and accuracy of the Inventory account balances of ₱ 79,487,706.72 as of December 31, 2020 cannot be ascertained due to non-submission of    Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) contrary to Section 13, Chapter 8 of GAM which resulted to failure to conduct periodic reconciliation between SPMU and Accounting Unit.

Section 13, Chapter 8 of GAM states that physical count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship.

Despite our previous year’s findings, the inventory committee has not complied on the submission of the result of the physical count every July and January of the year. As of this date, the RPCI for the 2nd semester of CY 2020 has not been submitted. There was no reconciliation made between the stock cards of the SPMU and the ledger cards of the accounting.

As of December 31, 2020, the reported inventory accounts per books are summarized below:



Inventory held for sale

₱6,240,773.07

Inventory held for distribution

6,570,694.34

Inventory held for manufacturing

12,357,171.84

Inventory held for consumption

33,273,994.29

Semi-Expendable Machinery and Equipment

2,236,481.94

	Semi-Expendable Furniture and Fixtures and Books

18,808,591.24

Total

₱79,487,706.72

As per inquiry with the Supply and Property Management Unit the physical inventory count was already started on the 3rd week of December 2020. However, no report on the physical count of inventories is yet submitted to the office of the auditor and the stock cards was not yet updated on the follow-up made last January 28, 2021. The fast rotation on the employees without proper turnover of documents and responsibilities accordingly contributed in the difficulty of the preparation and submission of the reports.

Non submission of the report on the physical count of inventories impede the audit team from verifying if the balances of the inventory accounts reflected in the financial statements reconciles with the balances in the RPCI as well as in ascertaining the existence of the reported inventories.

We recommended that management require the supply officer to:



a)	Submit the Report in the Physical Count of Inventories as of December 31, 2020 immediately;



b)	Maintain and update stock cards to record purchases and issuances of inventories; and



c)	Adhere to semi-annual conduct of physical count of inventories and conduct periodic reconciliation to ensure completeness and accuracy of balances of inventory accounts.



Management Comments:



	The management commented that the Inventory Committee Members were not able to submit their tasks on time due to regular duties at their specific unit/station. As of March 2, 2021 report had been forwarded/submitted for signature by the University President. At present, we are in the process of reconciling balances of inventories with the Accounting unit for accuracy. Property Cards is constantly updated.





13. 	Actual net income and expenses on the operations of projects covered by contract of agreements entered into by the University with private entities cannot be reliably determined due to the absence of financial reports and other supporting documents contrary to Section 7.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated Sept. 15, 2019 and Section 2 & 3, Chapter 4, Volume 1 of GAM for NGAs.



Section 7.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 provides that “the head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: (a) the required financial and other reports and statements are submitted by the concerned agency officials in such form and within the period prescribed by the Commission.”

Section 2a and b, Chapter 4, Volume I of GAM states that responsibility accounting provides access to cost and revenue information under the supervision of a manager having a direct responsibility for its performance. It is a system that measures the plans (by budgets) and actions (by actual results) of each responsibility center. Responsibility Center is a part, segment, unit or function of a government agency, headed by a manager, who is accountable for a specified set of activities. 



Section 3, Chapter 4, Volume 1 of GAM for NGAs provides that the responsibility accounting aims to: a) ensure that all costs and revenues are properly charged/credited to the correct responsibility center so that deviations from the budget can be readily attributed to managers accountable therefor; b) provide a basis for making decisions for future operations; and c) facilitate review activities, monitoring the performance of each responsibility center and evaluation of the effectiveness of agency’s operations.

On July 25, 2018, PILMICO Foods Corporation (proponent), Aboitiz Foundation Inc., and Central Mindanao University (beneficiary) entered into an agreement called the 2018 Project Athena. The Project involves the donation of the Sponsored facilities, which shall be used in the learning and development of the beneficiary’s agriculture and veterinary students, backyard farmers and animal production specialists in Mindanao.

On April 26, 2019, CMU entered into agreement with Houston Marketing Inc., - an entity engaged in the business of marketing and selling livestock and livestock feeds.  Per agreement, CMU has to grow finishing hogs, piglets, poultry broilers, poultry egg layers, and tilapia (“livestock”) using swine weaners, day-old layer broiler type poultry chicks, ready-to-lay pullets, and tilapia fry (livestock material) to be supplied by Houston Marketing Inc. while the latter has to pay CMU 50% of the net income from the actual operations of the period which will be calculated quarterly and shall be deposited to Landbank account of the University.



On May 22, 2020, CMU (first party) entered into agreement with RJR Agro-Industrial Enterprises (second party) – a private entity engaged in producing hybrid quality corn seeds. CMU has the responsibility to plant, care for and produce quality corn crop using its manpower and disbursing expenses, as may be necessary for the land preparation, planting, maintenance, harvesting and sacking of the corn crop while RJR Agro-Industrial Enterprises will provide the seeds, farm inputs and technical supports to CMU. Moreover, both agreed that after deducting all expenses incurred for the project for each planting season, CMU shall receive 60% of the net revenues generated by the project, while the second party shall receive (40%).



In 2020, CMU (grower) entered into agreement with Growers Agricultural Supply (grower a/s) – also a private entity engaged in producing hybrid quality corn seeds. Both parties agreed to have a profit sharing of 60/40 on the net income provided that total investment of Grower A/S will be returned, of which 60% is for the Growers A/S and 40% for the grower.



For CY 2020, the consolidated Other Business Income of RGMO totaled ₱4,192,013.40 of which the amount of ₱572,146.16 can be attributed to the income of the corn projects, however, expenses related to the latter cannot be determined since the responsibility center was not established. The income and expenses such as fuel and wages of the laborers incurred in corn plantation, harvesting and the like were charged to the projects in which these laborers were originally assigned e.g. Commercial Rice, Rubber etc. (See Table 2).

Management has provided this office the copies of the MOA with PILMICO, RJR Agro-Industrial Enterprises and Growers Agricultural Supply only in January 2021 after we wrote requesting for said documents sometime in November 2020. 



Inquiry disclosed that concerned private entities underlined in the above paragraphs were not able to provide financial reports detailing the expenses related to their respective projects hence, the actual net income and expenses incurred cannot be reliably determined. 





We recommended that Management do the following:



a)	Submit the progress reports of the 2018 Project Athena;



b)	Submit the financial reports of the projects entered into by the University with private entities; and



c)	Establish a Responsibility Center and Responsibility Accounting for the CMU-PILMICO partnership program, CMU-Houston Marketing, CMU- RJR Agro-Industrial Enterprises, and CMU- Growers Agricultural Supply agreements for proper control and monitoring.





Management Comments:



	The management commented that the assigned Financial Analyst tasked to monitor and evaluate the progress of those projects has informed that starting January 2021 he no longer intends to continue his employment and left without proper turnover. Thus, the Finance Management Services Office (FMSO) was having a hard time locating all the reports submitted by the partner entities since they have already submitted to the person in-charged. The management currently coordinating closely with the private entities to prepare the Financial Status and submit it immediately to the Office of the Auditor.

	



14. 	Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) of ₱ 815,798,334.00 in the Financial Statements is not reliable due to non-submission of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) and Property Cards were not updated and no reconciliation of accounting and property office records, contrary to Section 38 and 42 of Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume 1 resulting to doubts on the existence and accuracy of the PPE account balances presented in the financial statements. 



Section 38 of Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume 1 states that the entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31, of the following year. Equipment found at the station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording. 



Furthermore, Section 42 of the same states that the Chief Accountant shall maintain the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain Property Card (PC) for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR). (Emphasis ours)



Additionally, COA Circular 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 which provides the “Guidelines and Procedures in the Conduct of Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE), Recognition of PPE Items Found at Station, and Disposition for Non-existing/Missing PPE Items, for the One-Time Cleansing of PPE Account Balances of Government Agencies” states on its Section 5.3 that the members of the Inventory Committee shall be temporarily relieved of all their regular duties to devote their full time in the conduct of the physical inventory taking until the same is completed. 



To date, no submission of the RPCPPE was made by the Inventory Committee for the physical count made on the Property, Plant and Equipment including the Biological Assets of the University for the calendar year ending December 31, 2020. Per inquiry, the RSMU are still on the process of updating their property cards up to the current date.

Inquiry disclosed that the Inventory Committee had already started their actual physical count of the PPE and Livestock on the 3rd week of December 2020, however, due to limited manpower, the RPCPPE were not submitted and reconciliation was not made. Accordingly, some of the Inventory Committee Members were not relieved from their regular duties, the reason why they were not able to devote much time on the physical inventory taking. 



Non-submission of the RPCPPE precludes the audit team from verifying if the balances of the PPE accounts reflected in the financial statements reconciled with the balances in the RPCPPE as well as in ascertaining the existence of the reported PPE. 



We recommended that management to:



a)	Require the Inventory Committee to prepare the RPCPPE and furnish the auditor with copy of the report. Consequently, the Inventory Committee should strictly observe the deadline of submission of RPCPPE set forth in the Section 38 of Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume 1;



b)	Reconcile the balances appearing in the inventory report with the subsidiary ledger records of the accounting so that the total valuation of properties appearing in the TB could be validated as to its existence and completeness;



c)	Require the Supply Officer to regularly update the property cards on each of the PPE account in order to come up with realistic data of property inventory data of property inventory account; and



d)	Assign full-time office staff who will update, maintain and monitor property cards and other records and if possible, avoid fast turn-over of employees that leads to the weak monitoring of records.





Management Comments:



	The management committed to exert more effort to update and reconcile the PPE Ledger Card with that of the Inventory Report. They will continue to coordinate with the SPMU and Inventory Committee so that they can make the necessary adjustments in the books to come up with a complete and accurate balance of PPE account in the financial statements.





15. 	Returned and/or denied PhilHealth claims amounting to ₱651,739.00 and billings not recognized as income amounting to ₱4.3 Million, both for CY 2020 were deemed to be disadvantageous to the agency, inconsistent with the principles and guidelines set forth in PD 1445, RA 8292 – ‘Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997’, and the Government Accounting Manual, thus, depleting the Hospital’s resources which could have been used for beneficial purposes and understating the Hospital Fees account as of year-end.

Sec. 4 of PD 1445 provides that fiscal responsibility shall, to the greatest extent, be shared by all those exercising authority over the financial affairs, transactions, and operations of the government agency.

Section 4(d) of RA 8292 provides that income derived from university hospitals shall be exclusively earmarked for the operating expenses of the hospitals.

Sec. 7, Chapter 5, Vol. III of the GAM on the Recognition and Measurement of Revenue from Exchange Transactions, on Hospital Fees, the revenue recognition point shall be when fees are billed for hospital and related services rendered, or if not practicable, when fees are collected.

Examination of the documents and inquiry with the concerned offices yielded the following observations and initial comments:

a) The total denied claims received in CY 2020 amounting to ₱651,739.00 have been outstanding as of December 31, 2020. This office endeavored to know the amount of denied claims for CY 2018 and CY 2019 but the same is still in the process of being retrieved by the office in charge (Appendix F). It is to be noted that denied/returned claims received in CY 2020 may cover hospital services rendered during CY 2020 and in the prior year/s.

Upon inquiry with the university hospital personnel, it was found out that it was during the utilization of the system-based submission of billings/claims that the increase in denied claims started to rise. The most common reason for the denial as stated was the non-compliance with the standard of care.

It is to be noted that the hospital management has always been prudent in complying with all the requirements mandated by PhilHealth. However, it has been a recent dilemma in the processing of claims that although the same procedures are being applied today by the hospital and those prior to the application of the system-based submission, there has been a variation in the manner PhilHealth evaluates the supporting documents.

As of this writing, hospital management has already issued a Motion for Reconsideration for the denied claims.

As a self-sustaining unit whose funds revolve only around the operations of the hospital, it is imperative that the said unit should aspire to accomplish its mandate, mission and vision without incurring unnecessary losses. Otherwise, the funds of the hospital might be gradually depleted due to the costs which could have been controlled or avoided if sound management and procedures are improved.

b) The accounting unit has not been practicing the process of recognizing Accounts Receivable and Income at the time Billings are being sent to PhilHealth for reimbursement.  Under existing practice of recording PhilHealth related transactions, income is only recognized upon receipt of the PhilHealth Claims/Reimbursement.



In effect, the said accounts are deemed understated since Income from services rendered by the hospital are not recognized during the period the same were rendered, inconsistent with the accrual method of accounting. Consequently, for CY 2020, the sent billings and unrecognized income amounted to ₱4,321,560.00 (see Appendix G).

We recommended that management adhere to the following measures:

a)		Hospital management shall strictly adhere to the procedures and policies required by PhilHealth especially in its current system in the submission of billings for claims to be able to reduce the amount of denied/returned claims and more importantly, to reduce its additional cost at the expense of the University Hospital; and

	

b)	The Accounting Unit and the Billing Unit of the University Hospital shall coordinate with each other to the effect that every time billings are sent to PhilHealth, the Accounting Unit shall likewise be furnished a copy to enable them to timely make the proper entry to recognize Accounts Receivable [from PhilHealth] and Income from Hospital Fees.

Management Comments:



	The management committed to adhere to the recommendation in recording receivable from Philhealth and Hospital Income every time billings are sent to the Philhealth. The Accounting Office will also coordinate with the University Hospital Billing In-charge for the needed supporting documents for the proper recognition of receivable and income.

	



	16.	Expired drugs and medicines amounting to ₱197,919.49 remained in the premises of the hospital and were not dropped from the books of accounts, inconsistent with the guidelines stated in the Revised Health Care Waste Management of the DOH and the Government Accounting Manual thus, posing an environmental risk and possible misuse and accidental contamination or poisoning and overstating the Inventory Account as of year-end.

					

					Sec. 6.1 and 6.2 of the DOH Health Care Waste Management Manual provides for the guidelines regarding Health Care Waste Treatment and Waste Disposal Systems, respectively.

		

Section 9, Chapter 10 of GAM provides that supplies and materials purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running total for the cost of goods sold in each period. The system requires accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the maintenance of the SLC by the Accounting Division/Unit and Stock Card (SC) by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock (emphasis supplied). Regular purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for supplies and materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense accounts.



Sec. 15, 16 and 17 of the same chapter illustrates the Procedures in the Receipt, Inspection, Acceptance and Recording of Deliveries of Inventory Items; Procedures in the Requisition and Issue of Inventory Items; and provides for the related Records, Forms and Reports to be prepared and/or maintained.



GAM Volume III likewise describes the relevant accounts as follows:

Drugs and Medicines Inventory - This account is used to recognize the cost of drugs and medicines purchased/received for government operations. Credit this account for issuance to end-users, transfers, loss or other disposal.



Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Inventory - This account is used to recognize the cost of medical, dental and laboratory supplies purchased/received for government operations. Credit this account for issuance to end-users, transfers, loss or other disposal. 

Examination of the documents and inquiry with the concerned offices yielded the following observations and initial comments:

a) The university hospital has been temporarily storing expired medicines in an area within the hospital premises pending construction of the requested septic vault. A request to construct the said structure has been made but as of year-end, it has not been completed yet.



b) Per inquiry with the UPDO, their task is limited to the preparation of the Program of Works and Estimates for requested projects and/or facilities and that the POW for the Septic Vault has already been forwarded to the proper offices for approval and implementation.

					

				c) The university hospital has not been furnishing the accounting unit with the report of expired drugs and medicines for dropping due to the said delegation of such responsibility to the Supply and Property Management Unit (SPMU). However as of year-end, no report has been submitted to the accounting office.

				

Delay in the disposal of expired drugs and medicine poses an environmental risk and possible misuse and accidental contamination or poisoning. Moreover, the related Inventory account is overstated as of year-end due to the non-recognition of the expired drugs and medicines.

		We recommended that management require the hospital to:

a)			Fast tract the completion of the requested septic vault in order for them to promptly dispose expired drugs and medicines and other related items in the appropriate manner as provided for by the DOH guidelines; and

b)			Require the hospital personnel in charge of medicines to furnish accounting count list of expired drugs and medicines for dropping in the books of accounts.

		Management Comments:

			The management commented that the Program of Works for the Hospital’s Septic vault had already been submitted to the budget office last February 18, 2021. Further, CMU Hospital is 100% compliant to DOH guidelines, procedures and policies in handling expired medicines properly. During the start of COVID-19 pandemic up to present, the hospital admission and patient consultation have significantly reduced. This affects the disbursement of medicine stocks and some hospital supplies which resulted to its expiration. These expired medicines are for proper disposal subject to the DOH guidelines, policies and laws hence it is still under the hospital safe keeping. Moreover, before this COVID-19 pandemic strike, they already sent an official communication letter to the Office of the President thru UPDO last October 2019 requesting for a construction of a Septic Vault within hospital premises. Due to the inaction of their request, they sent series of follow-up letters thereafter and even verbal communication. Fortunately, through the UPDO, their request was finally acted upon last Feb 19, 2020 finalizing the layout and budget.

		B. Value for Money

17. The Resource Generation and Management Office’s (RGMO) overall net loss of ₱12,479,911.82 for the period ended December 31, 2020 and the poor performance of some IGPs for the last five years affected the objective of the University to fund its development needs.



Section 124, Chapter 4, Title III of P.D. No. 1445 states that it shall be the direct responsibility of the agency head to install, implement, and monitor a sound system of internal control.

Section 3, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of GAM for NGAs provides that it is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with laws and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.



Figure 1. Five-Year Net Income (Loss) Trend Analysis of RGMO







Figure 1 presents the five-year net income (loss) trend analysis of RGMO which showed a declining trend from CY 2018 to CY 2020. An overall net loss of ₱12,479,911.82 can be inferred as a huge and unusual decrease in the performance of the RGMO. For the last five years most of the IGPs has been incurring loss as shown in Appendix H.

GRAND TOTAL

(₱12,479,911.82)



 

The Service Office incurred a total net loss of ₱3,165,082.23 for CY 2020. The Service Office is composed of the RGMO office and Machinery & Equipment Maintenance Unit (MEMU) which serve as the servicing unit of the other income generating units hence, it can’t generate income on its own except the MEMU. The Management can formulate a strategic plan for the maximization of the MEMU’s potential to generate income rather than loss every year. Verification disclosed that the Other Maintenance and Operating Expenses include payment for meals, snacks and accommodation charged mostly to RGMO office totaling ₱109,310.00 without complete supporting documents (Appendix I). Since RGMO office does not earn an income, the Management shall ensure that expenses incurred are minimal and necessary for the operations.



The Crops Enterprise Office resulted to a total net income of ₱649,876.65 for the period ended December 31, 2020. However, as shown in Table 1 the Rice Seeds Project and Coconut Project incurred a net loss of ₱1,313,004.98 and ₱46,734.69, respectively. It has been observed that the salaries and wages took 87% and 65% of the projects operating expenses, respectively.



The Livestock Enterprise Office (LEO) incurred a total net loss of ₱7,394,629.97. Some projects under LEO were used for instructional purposes such as Beef & Cattle and Dairy Project. In 2020, the Dairy Project incurred a loss of assets amounting to ₱7,194,000.00, of which the total amount of ₱7,100,000.00 is attributed to the mortality of fifty (50) heads pregnant cows received from NDA on June 5, 2020. 



The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected the sales of most RGMO responsibility centers particularly the HSFEO which incurred a net loss of ₱2,731,035.90 for CY 2020, it’s the first net loss that the HSFEO has incurred since 2013. However, verification disclosed that the Management was not able to limit and control the incurrence of expenses like meals during RGMO meetings which became frequent compared in previous years and expenses on travelling which was subject to Notice of Suspension. Fuel, Oil and Lubricants Expense, Salaries and Wages – Contractual and other expenses include those that can be attributed to the production of hybrid corn projects however, a responsibility center for the latter was not created hence, actual expenses of some of the IGPs cannot be reliably determined.



Lack of internal control and constant monitoring of the performance of each income generating project resulted to an unusual net loss and poor performance. Moreover, abrupt transfer of Project Heads from one project to another without proper turnover also contributed in the lack of monitoring of each income generating project.  The RGMO’s overall net loss of ₱12,479,911.82 for the period ended December 31, 2020 and the poor performance of some IGPs for the last five years affected the objective of the University to fund its development needs through its IGPs. 



We recommended that Management do following:

a)	Establish strict internal control particularly in the disbursement of RGMO funds;



b)	Require the Project Heads to submit monthly and/or quarterly status reports and other pertinent reports necessary for the monitoring of each IGP’s performance to the VP for RGMO;



c)	Require turnover of documents in case of transfer of Project Heads from one project to another to avoid displacement of IGPs; and



d)	Reassess and evaluate the existing strategy employed by the RGMO to make each IGP reach its target especially on maximizing its revenue and minimize its expenses.



Management Comments:



The management committed to adhere to all the recommendations. The office will define specific job descriptions and custodianship/assignments for RGMO employees and define proper process flow of documents especially those which involve financial transactions. The office will also ensure proper recording and monitoring of inventories, sales and expenses as part of internal control. Submission of monthly reports was already put in place, even the weekly monitoring system was also employed, however, the office will ensure to impose strict and timely submission of the relevant documents to the VP for RGMO for validation, assessment and evaluation. For future transfer of Project Heads, the office will ensure to require appropriate turnover of documents. The office will conduct a monthly meeting (preferably every end of the month) together with the Project Heads to discuss and evaluate the monthly performance and financial status of each RGMO projects. This will also be a time to discuss project concerns and possible solutions to improve operation and production.  Hope pandemic is over, for the projects to attain their target sales objective.

GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT (GAD)



		The University was able to undertake GAD activities required for the stages of gender mainstreaming. Based on the University’s Annual Gender and Development Accomplishment Report for CY 2020 which was also submitted to PCW, CMU attributed a total of ₱64,950,000.00, out of the total agency approved budget of ₱748,719,000.00

		

		Joint Circular No. 2004-1 dated August 15, 2001 of the DBM, NEDA and NCRFW, requires the preparation of an Annual Gender and Development Plan that will provide the mechanics for the development of programs, activities and projects to promote gender-responsive governance, protect and fulfill women’s human rights, and promote women’s economic empowerment. The GAD Plan and Budget shall constitute at least five percent (5%) of the agency’s total appropriations as provided in Section 31 of General Appropriations Act of FY 2020.

		

		Audit of GAD funds was confined to the verification of status of accomplishments vis-à-vis the GAD Plan. It was noted that there were various GAD related activities that were accomplished during the year incurring total expenditures of ₱64,950,000.00 (Appendix J).

	

	We have recommended that Management continue to appropriate at least 5% of the total appropriations for GAD activities, with due consideration of cost attributable to regular programs, projects and activities to achieve the mandated commitment to pursue women’s empowerment and gender equality.





COMPLIANCE WITH PROPERTY INSURANCE LAW



The University’s Property Officer is not properly bonded as of December 31, 2020 contrary to Section 101 of PD 1445. However, management is compliant with Republic Act No. 656, as amended by PD 245 dated July 13, 1973, which states that “All departments, bureaus, offices, agencies and instrumentalities of the government, including government owned and controlled corporations are directed to insure against insurable risk all property and assets belonging to the government, its agencies and political subdivisions with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS”.



The University secured insurance of its property for the period January 7, 2020 to January 7, 2021 with the Government Service Insurance System.





STATUS OF SUSPENSIONS, DISALLOWANCES AND CHARGES



As of December 31, 2020 the Statement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges reflected a total balance of ₱2,364,641.78 and ₱3,854,656.43 for suspensions and disallowances respectively.



The agency has unsettled prior years’ disallowances in the amount of ₱3,854,656.43 representing overpayment of centennial and anniversary bonus, honorarium paid to the Office of the Solicitor General and surcharge for late payment of electric bill which are still under appeal by Management.

STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF PRIOR YEARS’ AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS



Out of the thirteen (13) prior years’ audit recommendations, three (3) were fully implemented and ten (10) were partially implemented, as follows:



Reference

Observation

Recommendations

Status of Implementation

AOM No. 2020-01 (19); p.65 

	1. Accuracy of the Accounts Receivable balance of Fund Cluster 5 (Special Trust Fund) as December 31, 2019 amounting to ₱ 58,859,762.01 cannot be ascertained due to: (a) unreconciled balances in some of the students accounts as reflected  in the Schedule and Ledgers contrary to Section 111 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 and (b) non-inclusion of students who still have unpaid balances but are inactive or unenrolled as of SY 2019-2020 1st Semester in the balance of the receivable account contrary to Par. 16 of PPSAS thus, casting doubts on the accuracy of the said account and on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements.



We recommended that the accounting section assign additional personnel to do the task of encoding the payments from CHED to the respective ledger of students and verify the accuracy of the account balances reflected in the schedule used in the financial statement.  Consequently, the necessary adjusting/correcting entries for any discrepancies shall be recorded. And require the bookkeeper to set the timing of printing the schedule on the same date of the cut off period. 



We recommended that the management require the Management Information System Department to make some upgrade on the software for the enrolment system such that the schedule of students with unpaid balances will include inactive or unenrolled students for a complete and accurate accounts receivable. 



Partially Implemented







Remarks:

The required update in the MIS department was not yet implemented.

AOM No. 2020-02 (19); p.67 

	2. Non-submission of payrolls and supporting documents contrary to COA Circular No. 2009-006 thereby preventing the audit team in validating the University’s personnel services totaling ₱487,945,997.53 as of December 31, 2019.

























	

	Biometrics system costing ₱500,000.00 was not fully utilized contrary to Section 2 of P.D. 1445 thus precluding the University to have an efficient and effective time tracking system.



We recommended the management the following:



a. Require the Accounting Unit to formulate strategies in order to speed up the scanning, if possible more staff must be assigned to conduct the scanning of backlogs to solve the current undue delay of submission of payrolls and related supporting documents; and



b. Require the employees who have travels on official time/official business to submit the Certificate of Appearance as supporting documents to their daily time records.



We recommended the management to require the HRMO to hasten the encoding and updating of the employees’ service records by providing additional staff to do the task in order for the agency to proceed in the full utilization of the biometrics system.



Partially Implemented 



Remarks:

Delayed submission of CY 2020 payrolls was still observed.

AOM No. 2020-003; p.69

3. Failure of the agency to implement the Comprehensive Integrated Government Financial Management System (CIGFMS) totaling ₱8,980,000.00 contrary to Section 2 of P.D. 1445 has deprived the University on the benefit of an efficient and effective reporting and processing of transactions.



We recommended the management to create a task group composed mainly of the previously trained employees from the BAC, SPMU and Accounting department to focus on the implementation of the CIGFMS for a specific period of time to be determined by the management.



Partially Implemented 



Remarks:

The CIGFMS was not yet implemented.

AOM No. 2020-04 (19); p.70 

4. Failure of the Supply and Property Management Unit and the Accounting Unit to adhere to the proper monitoring, controlling and recording of acquisition and disposal of inventory contrary to Section 13 to 15, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs thus rendering the existence and accuracy of the reported balances of Inventory accounts totaling ₱70,075,004.36 as of December 31, 2019 unreliable.



We recommended the following:



a. We require the Inspectorate team to inspect the delivered times on the day of the delivery with the presence of the supplier, property custodian, end user and COA staff to witness the same and refrain from delaying the inspection;



b. We require the Supply and Property Management Unit (SPMU) after receipt of inventories to submit immediately the Copy of Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR), photocopy of the Purchase Order (PO), delivery receipts (DR) and other necessary documents to the Accounting Unit for the issuance of Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to recognize the receipt of inventories in the books of account and updating of Supplies Ledger Card (SLC); 



c. We require the SPMU to submit on a timely manner the copy of Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI), original Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS), Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) and other documents necessary particularly the issuances of inventories if the UIGP, to the Accounting Unit for the updating of the SLC and preparation of JEV; and



d. We require the SPMU and Accounting Unit to assign a representative to reconcile their records for the inventories already issued to end users in the previous years but were not disposed in the books of the agency to fast track the provision of supporting documents for the dropping of inventories and to reflect the correct balances of inventory accounts. Regularly conduct a reconciliation of inventory records thereafter.





Partially Implemented 



Remarks:



Issuance of some inventories/ materials was not properly observed.



A portion of the Drugs and Medicines Inventory totaling ₱3,078,138.29 sold in the University Hospital were recorded by the Accounting Unit as an outright expense upon transfer by the Supply Office to the University Hospital contrary to Section 7, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs thus no proper matching of revenue and expense for the period.



Construction Materials for Distribution under Cluster 6 amounting to ₱759,540.00 has no record of disposal for more than a year contrary to Section 7, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs thus rendered the balance doubtful since the balance could not be accounted to date.



We recommended the Management to designate a personnel in the University Hospital who will monitor and record the receipts and releases of medicines and submit the required documents to the SPMU for the preparation of the RSMI. 











We recommended the SPMU and Accounting Unit to coordinate in the proper disposition of the total balance by retrieving the documentary requirements such as RSMI, withdrawal slips and other similar documents in order to properly record the dropping of inventories from the books of the agency and reflect the accurate balance of the related inventory account.













The supplies ledger cards (SLC) cards submitted were incomplete contrary to Section 9, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs thus the reconciliation could not be done.

















Preparation of some of the report of supplies and materials issued not in conformity with the existing regulation contrary to Section 6, Chapter 8 of GAM thus affects the accuracy of both the expense and the balances of the inventories in the financial statement as of December 31, 2019.







Bonding requirement of the property custodian was not observed contrary to Section 4.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009 hence put the university from risk on not being indemnified in case of loss of assets/properties under her custody.



We recommended the Accounting Unit to fast track the preparation and updating of SLCs in order for the audit team to conduct immediate reconciliation to validate the balances of all inventory accounts including the semi-expendable properties of the university.





We recommended the Accounting Unit to prepare the SLCs of Cluster 6 and require the SPMU to assist the property custodian in the proper preparation of the RSMI and submit the same to the accounting office to complete the filling up for the cost of issued supplies and materials for more accurate cost of the supplies expense account.





We recommended the property custodian to apply for fidelity bond.





AOM No. 2020-05 (19); p.77 

5. Honoraria amounting to at least P608,160.00, pertaining to the CMU College Admission Test Board and Graduate School Admission Test Board were paid  without the appropriate legal basis, contrary to PD No. 1445 – ‘Government Auditing Code of the Philippines’, COA Circular No. 2012-003 – ‘Updated Guidelines for the Prevention and Disallowance of Irregular, Unnecessary, Excessive, Extravagant and Unconscionable Expenditures’ and other pertinent rules and jurisprudence, hence, casting doubt as to the regularity and legality of the aforesaid transactions and moreover, depleting government funds which could have been used for other valid expenditures.



	It was recommended that management adhere to the following measures:

	a. Refund the entire amount of Honoraria paid out to the CMUCAT and GSAT Board during the Calendar Year 2019 and any subsequent payments thereof; and

	b. Henceforth, discontinue the practice of granting honoraria to members of the CMUCAT and GSAT Board, such being contrary to rules and regulations.



Partially Implemented





Remarks:

Additional documents were not yet submitted by Management to justify the release of the honoraria.





Honoraria amounting to ₱342,666.68 in the minimum, labeled as Executive Honoraria, were paid without the appropriate legal basis, contrary to PD No. 1445 – ‘Government Auditing Code of the Philippines’, CSC Memorandum Circular No. 06-05 – Guidelines on Designation and other pertinent rules and jurisprudence, hence, casting doubt as to the regularity and legality of the aforesaid transactions and moreover, depleting government funds which could have been used for other valid expenditures.



	It was recommended that management adhere to the following measures:

	a. Refund the entire amount of Executive Honoraria paid out during the Calendar   Year 2019 and any subsequent payments thereof which are contrary to above-mentioned rules and regulations;

	b. Henceforth, discontinue the practice of granting Executive Honoraria since the same is contrary to laws and regulations; and

c. Make a query with the proper authorities such as the DBM and/or the CSC as to the available remedies regarding the above circumstance wherein executive  positions held by the faculty cannot be entitled to RATA.





2020-06 (19); p.82 

6. Disbursement vouchers of various funds totaling to ₱126,848,728.97 and pertinent supporting documents for the month December 2019 were not submitted within the prescribed period, contrary to COA Circular No. 2009-006, thereby causing undue delay in the audit of the financial transactions.

 

We recommended that the Chief of the Accounting Unit be reminded to submit within the prescribed deadlines the required reports and pertinent supporting documents to the audit team to give ample time for review. Further, implement adequate measures (assign additional personnel for the scanning of the documents) that will enable the agency to meet the deadline.

7. The transactions and operations of the University Press were classified and recorded under Cluster 5 (Internally Generated Fund) instead to Cluster 6 or the Business Related Funds as of year-end contrary to the fund cluster accounting as prescribed by Sections 6 & 13 of Chapter of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs Volume 1, thus affecting the reliability of the account balances in the Financial Statements under Cluster 5 and Cluster 6 as of year-end.



We recommended to management to consider reclassification of the University Press and its operations and transactions under Cluster 6, following the procedures of the University if required.

Fully Implemented

8. Non-submission of the Bank Reconciliation Statements and variances observed in of some bank accounts is not in conformity with the pertinent provisions in PD 1445 and Chapter 21 of GAM for NGAs, Volume 1 thus precluding the audit team from conducting timely review and verification on the accuracy of the cash in bank accounts as of December 31, 2019.

10. Several fund transfers from various national government agencies in the total amount of ₱16,057,593.98 remain unsettled/unliquidated as of December 31, 2018.



We recommended that:



a. Demand immediately from all the projects leaders for the settlement/liquidation of their respective projects by complying all the documentary requirements for the settlement/liquidation thereof. Return any remaining funds to the sources agency or to the national treasury.



b. For active accounts, instruct the project leaders to monitor regularly the financial status of their projects;



c. Instruct the accountant to conduct reconciliation of balances with the source agencies to fast track the settlement of these accounts; and



d. Submit the status of each project to the office of the auditor indicating the source agency and contact details (to include active email addresses) to enable us to conduct confirmation of balances.



Partially Implemented



Remarks:

There were still unliquidated/ unsettled fund transfers.





Disposition/closure of dormant funds and/or accounts was improper contrary to COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 5, 1997 thus, casting doubts as to the validity of adjustments made.



We recommended that Management:



a. Revisit and strictly observe COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 5, 1997-Guidelines on the Proper Disposition/Closure of Dormant Funds and/or Accounts of National Government Agencies to ensure compliance on the proper disposition of dormant funds and/or accounts.

P13.8 Million of completed infrastructure projects were not recognized in their respective Property, Plant and Equipment Accounts, inconsistent with the guidelines set forth in the Government Accounting Manual, thereby understating the PPE accounts and related Depreciation Expense accounts as of December 31, 2018.



We recommend to management the following measures:                                  



a. Review the Construction-in-Progress account and reconcile the same with the Consolidated Quarterly Report on PPAs to come up with a list of on-going and completed projects that would coincide with each other’s’ records.



b. Require the PIU and end-users to submit the Certificate of Completion and Letter of Acceptance respectively, together with the Request for Inspection/Final Billing for the projects declared as 100% completed during the CY 2018 to facilitate the immediate recognition of Construction-in-Progress and subsequent transfer of said projects to their proper PPE accounts.



c. On the part of the Accounting Unit, upon receipt of the Certificate of Completion, Letter of Acceptance, and Request for Inspection/Final Billing from the PIU, record as Construction-in-Progress the remaining cost of the project with a corresponding credit to Accounts Payable.  



d. Henceforth, to facilitate the timely recognition of completed projects to Property, Plant and Equipment, it is recommended that the PIU and end-user, upon having satisfactorily inspected and accepted the completed projects, issue the necessary documents such as the Certificate of Completion and the Letter of Acceptance and forward the same together with the Request for Inspection/ Final Billing, to the Accounting Unit to serve as basis for recording the amounts in Construction-in-Progress and Accounts Payable.

It is hereby recommended that management comply with the following:



a. Prepare a revised report showing the actual status of the above project as of December 31, 2018.



b. Henceforth, to avoid inaccuracies in the reports being submitted, the General Services Department, the University Planning and Development Office and the Project Implementation Unit shall formulate a system to effectively ensure that the reports being prepared and submitted by their respective offices are in consonance with each other more importantly, in accordance with the actual status of the projects.





AOM No. 2019-006 (2018); p.70

12. The Biological Assets account of the agency amounting to ₱32,301,652.99 is unreliable due to (a) inconsistent application of the policy in valuation of biological assets; (b) non-maintenance of Biological Assets Property Card and non-preparation and non-submission of Quarterly Report of Biological Assets; (c) inadequate disclosures in the Notes to Financial Statements; and (d) recording of non-existing biological assets in the agency’s books hence, casting doubt as to the validity of the account balance as reflected in the financial statements.



We recommend that Management:



a. Consistently check and update all the valuation on each group of biological assets and draw appropriate adjusting entries for the over/undervalued biological assets;



b. Instruct the Biological Asset/s Caretaker or Officer in-charge to prepare the Biological Assets Property Card and Quarterly Report of Biological Assets (QRBA) per Appendix 78 and Appendix 79, Volume II of GAM for NGAs;



c. Substantiate the amounts reflected in the Financial Statements by providing sufficient disclosures in the Notes to Financial Statements as required in the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS); and                             



d. Instruct the Accountant to draw adjusting entries to derecognize the two (2) heads of bulls for fair presentation of the Financial Statements.



Partially Implemented

13. Long outstanding receivables amounting to ₱2,383,842.55 or 15% of the total Receivables – STF remained uncollected for more than 8years contrary to SUCs mandate and responsibility to mobilize their own resources and Sections 123 and 124 of PD 1445, thus adversely affecting the recovery of the fund. In addition the University lost the opportunity to utilize the amount for other investment that will earn additional income or to use for its operation.



We recommended to the President of the University the following:



a. Require the Cashier to send collection and demand letters to the last known address of the persons involved;



b. Require the Accountant to closely monitor the receivables by determining their cause and the personnel responsible for those instances/occurrence should be held liable, as necessary;



c. Require the FMO/Accounting personnel in-charge to collect to submit the status on the actions taken on the long outstanding receivables; and



d. Exert more efforts to collect the receivables. If collection proves futile, submit a request to the Commission on Audit for write-off of the accounts as required under Section 36 of PD 1445 supported with the required documents, such as documents showing management’s efforts to collect or demand letters, among others.



Partially Implemented



Remarks:

Long outstanding receivables still existed and no request for write off and status on the actions taken on the long outstanding receivables.
