C)		Scope of Audit

	

The audit covered the transactions and operations of the OGCC for CY 2020. 





D)	Auditor’s Report 



The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the OGCC as of December 31, 2020.











E)	Summary of Observations and Recommendations 



1)	The accuracy of Property, Plant and Equipment accounts and Other Assets account with balances of ₱30,442,455.96 and ₱37,219.19, respectively, at year-end is doubtful due to a discrepancy of ₱11,330,514.32 caused by non-reconciliation of records by the Accounting Section and Property Section and the non-availability of documents/records to prove the propriety of the accounts. Moreover, Property Inventory Form (PIF) was not prepared and submitted to the Audit Team (AT) as required in COA Circular 2018-002 which precluded the AT from determining the accuracy of the insurable physical assets with the GSIS.



We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) require the Accountant to analyze and determine the composition of the unsubstantiated balances of Other Assets and Communication Equipment accounts; (b) observe guidelines prescribed in COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 in cleansing the PPE accounts; (c) ensure to complete the reconciliation of accounting and property records and effect the necessary adjustment, if warranted; (d) ensure to identify the exact number and value of properties to be insured with the GSIS; and (e) require the Property Section to accomplish and submit the PIF to the AT pursuant to COA Circular No. 2018 -002 dated May 31, 2018.



2)	Out of 389 requests for opinion from various Government – Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) to be acted upon by the agency for the year 2020, only 177 or 45.50 percent were released within the time frame of 20 working days leaving a balance of 212 or 54.50 percent of “non-complying” which incurred delays ranging from one to 262 days, contrary to Section 3 Rule 5 of OGCC Lawyer’s Manual.



We recommended and Management agreed to ensure adherence to the R2R 20 working day cycle pursuant to the OGCC Rules and Regulations.  Moreover, consider upgrading of the application/system use in the General Logbook by including fields that can accommodate all activities while in the possession of the assigned team so as to monitor the status of each request for opinion at any given time.



3)	Submission of Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) with supporting documents for transactions covering January to August 2020 amounting to ₱116,293,268.60 to the AT was delayed by 105 to 188 days. Thus, timely verification of transactions could not be conducted. On the other hand, financial accounts for the period September to December 2020 totaling ₱70,506,401.96 were not submitted as of this report contrary to Section 100 of PD No. 1445.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to immediately transmit DVs including its supporting documents for the period September to December, 2020 to the Audit Team.  Henceforth, design strategies to take into consideration the challenges posed by the current situation to ensure that DVs and its supporting documents are submitted within the prescribed period.



The foregoing observations and recommendations were discussed with the concerned officials of the agency in an exit conference conducted on March 10, 2021. Management’s views and reactions were considered in the report, where appropriate.



4)	Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations



Out of the six audit recommendations embodied in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report, five were fully implemented while one was not implemented. Details are shown in Part III of this report.
