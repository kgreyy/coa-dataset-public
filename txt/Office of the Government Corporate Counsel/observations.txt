1)	The accuracy of Property, Plant and Equipment accounts and Other Assets account with balances of ₱30,442,455.96 and  ₱37,219.19, respectively, at year-end is doubtful due to a discrepancy of ₱11,330,514.32 caused by non-reconciliation of records by the Accounting Section and Property Section and the non-availability of documents/records to prove the propriety of the accounts.  Moreover, Property Inventory Form (PIF) was not prepared and submitted to the Audit Team (AT) as required in COA Circular 2018-002 which precluded   the AT from determining the accuracy of the insurable physical assets with the GSIS.



	1)	The Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) for NGAs provides that: Communication Equipment account is used to recognize the cost incurred in the purchase or assembly or fair market value, if acquired through donation or transfers without cost, of communication equipment for use in government operations. Credit this account for derecognition of the carrying amount of the replaced parts in major repairs, or disposal.



	2)	COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 provides the guidelines and procedures in the conduct of Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE), recognition of items found at station and disposition for non- existing/missing PPE items, for the one-one time cleansing of PPE account balances of government agencies. 



	3)	Item 5.e of COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 requires agencies to submit the consolidated Property Inventory Form (PIF) to the AT not later than April 30 of each year.



	4)	Analysis of the PPE accounts disclosed the following deficiencies:



--	Unreconciled balances



	5)	Discrepancy of ₱11,330,514.32 between the balance per General Ledger (GL)-PPE of ₱30,442,455.96 and the balance per RPCPPE of ₱19,111,941.64 for CY  2020 were noted in the audit.  The issue on non-reconciliation of the accounting and property records had been raised in the previous years’ Annual Audit Reports. However, in the audit of 2020 transactions, the same deficiency was noted. It is informed that the Accounting and Property Sections had started the reconciliation of their respective records only last year (in 2019) and still on-going as the end of CY 2020. Details are as follows:

	6)	Communication Equipment (CE) valued at ₱32,210.00 per books was not reported/included in the RPCPPE. According to the Inventory Committee, they did not find any item classified as CE during the inventory taking. Verification of accounting records revealed various transactions and adjustments to the account such as derecognition of CE in the amount of ₱127,360.67 in CY 2014; addition/acquisition in the amount of ₱34,799.33 in 2016; disposal in the amount of ₱31,410.00 in 2017; and adjustment in the amount of P800.00 in 2018, leaving a balance of ₱32,210.00 at year-end.



	7)	Further examination disclosed that there were disposals of office equipment, furniture and fixtures and ICT equipment in 2015 based on the records of Property Section but were not derecognized from the books of accounts. Moreover, results of initial reconciliation by the Accounting and Property Sections revealed that various fully depreciated PPEs were missing.



	8)			The total discrepancy of ₱11,330,514.32 was indicative of lack of emphasis on the importance of reconciliation. Reconciliation is defined as a procedure where two independent, but related records are put into agreement to provide accuracy of the account and to make necessary adjustments.



	9)	On the other hand, analysis of accounts revealed that the Other Assets account balance of ₱37,219.19 has been existing and non-moving since 2015. Interview with the Accountant disclosed that there was no Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) on file or any document to show what has transpired in recording such transaction. Tracing back at the previous years’ Annual Audit Reports, the balance of Other Assets account comprised of unserviceable PPEs which was previously reported at ₱15,061.19 and recorded under the Other Losses account.  However, there was no information on the increase of ₱22,157.81 in CY 2015.



	10)	The existence of enormous amount of discrepancy affected the accuracy of the PPE and Other Assets accounts reflected in the FS.



--	Non-submission of PIF



	11)	The agency paid the total amount of ₱26,635.04 to GSIS for the insurance of Motor Vehicles and various computers, electrical appliances, furniture, equipment, and other office items installed and stored at the different offices of the OGCC. Details are shown at the next page:

	12)	The value of the properties insured with the GSIS was based on the 2019 RPCPPE which is not reconciled with the amount per accounting records. Verification disclosed that the RPCPPE includes unserviceable and disposed properties with undetermined value. It was noted in the previous years’ audit reports that the Property/Supply Section does not maintain complete file of the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP). 



	13)	Moreover, the Property Officer did not prepare and submit the PIF to the AT as required under COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 which precluded the AT from determining the accuracy of insurable physical assets. 



	14)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	require the Accountant to analyze and determine the composition of the unsubstantiated balances of Other Assets and Communication Equipment accounts;



b)	observe guidelines prescribed in COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 in cleansing the PPE accounts; 



c)	ensure to complete the reconciliation of accounting and property records and effect the necessary adjustment, if warranted;



d)	ensure to identify the exact number and value of properties to be insured with the GSIS; and



e)	require   the Property Section to accomplish and submit the PIF to the AT pursuant to COA Circular No. 2018 -002 dated May 31, 2018.

Management Comment



	--	On-going verification of said accounts is being done by the Accounting and Property Sections. Records disclosed that these were items recorded as asset instead of expense. Disposal made in CY 2015 were not adjusted in the books. JEV will be drawn to effect the adjustment of erroneous entries made as well as to record the disposal of all unserviceable communication equipment reported in FY 2015 IIRUP. Further, the current accounting practice is to derecognize the PPE from the books only upon disposal of the unserviceable properties. If it was only listed in the IIRUP, it should not be dropped from the books. Management acknowledged that PIF was not submitted to the Audit Team and promised to comply with the pertinent provisions of COA Circular Nos.  92-390 and 2018-002.



COMPLIANCE AUDIT



2)	Out of 389 requests for opinion from various Government – Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) to be acted upon by the agency for the year 2020, only 177 or 45.50 percent were released within the time frame of 20 working days leaving a balance of 212 or 54.50 percent of “non-complying” which incurred delays ranging from one to 262 days, contrary to Section 3 Rule 5 of OGCC Lawyer’s Manual.

	7)	It was justified that non-compliance with the 20-day cycle was due mainly of the pandemic.  OGCC implemented the Alternative Work Arrangements (AWA) where work is mostly done by electronic mails (email). Some requests were not sent or misplaced in the spam folders of the recipients. 



	8)	Evaluation of the Monitoring Procedures in rendering Legal Opinion within the time frame revealed the following lapses:



a)	Lack of personnel in the Records Section



OGCC has a centralized recording of all communications received from various government agencies. For CY 2020, OGCC received 5,729 total documents to be encoded in the General Logbook database.  Upon receipt of the document, the incoming encoder encoded the details of the document.  After encoding, an Assigned Slip (Tracking Form) will be attached before forwarding the same to GCC for instructions to the concerned team/sections. The Records Section has 10 personnel. Five are involved in encoding the transactions and release of documents. The remaining five are for messengerial function.



b)	There was no report or evaluation made by the Records Section on the “Non-Complying” Opinion. 



It is the duty of the Records Officer (RO) to review the accomplishments of each team, as required in the Work Instructions Manual.  The RO is required to determine if the Legal Opinion is released within the time frame. The Tracking Form (OP -1) will be stamped “Complying” or “Non-Complying” and if found non-complying, the RO further studies where the non-compliance occurred or started to occur. 



Scrutiny of the Tracking Forms revealed that these were stamped with “Complying” and “Non-Complying” and filed separately. However, there was no report made by the RO stating where the delay occurred or started to occur as required under the Work Instructions Manual.



The Next-in-Rank in the Records Section justified that not all Tracking Forms were attached to the documents upon return by the assigned team. Hence, the complying and non-complying folders were incomplete.



c)	The system/database does not cater the information on the status of the request at any given time.



It was observed that the General Logbook system contains the details of the R2R Policy Cycle which includes among others the:

				

--					Details of the documents such as: the name of the requesting GOCC, subject matter;

--					Date of receipt;

--					Assignment Slip No.;

--					Assigned lawyer;

--					Opinion number;

--					Date of opinion; and

--					Date of dispatch.

				

	9)	At a glance to the Tracking Form, the flow of documents can easily be monitored.  It was noted that the grade given by the Team Leader to the assigned lawyer was also indicated.



	10)	It was observed that information for columns provided for GCC, Team Leader, Handling Lawyer and Review Process in the Tracking Form were handwritten by the concerned officials. On the other hand, the details of the document, date of receipt and due dates of each process are being encoded upon receipt of the document. The Secretary of each team records in the logbook every activity while the request is being acted upon by the team.



	11)	The status of the request while in the possession of the assigned team cannot be determined at once due to non- availability of fields in the system which accommodate information on the action taken by the assigned team.  The Secretary of each team maintains logbook to monitor the status manually.   Even the AT had difficulty in establishing the total number of “complying” and “non-complying”, the exact number of pending requests and where the delay started to occur due to the incomplete records maintained by the Records Section. Had the system included fields that can display the activities/processes under the assigned team, the status of the request can be easily monitored. The Records Officer can determine the occurrence of “non-complying status”; hence, she can prepare an evaluation report where the delays occurred.



	12)	We recommended and Management agreed to ensure adherence to the R2R 20 working day cycle pursuant to the OGCC Rules and Regulations.  Moreover, consider upgrading of the application/system use in the General Logbook by including fields that can accommodate all activities while in the possession of the assigned team so as to monitor the status of each request for opinion at any given time.







Management Comment 



	13)	Management justified that the delay was due to implementations of AWA during this time of pandemic where only a limited number of employees are physically reporting to the office at any given time, and glitches in technology particularly in sending and receiving of emails largely contributed to the delays in the release of the opinions. Due to the current set up, tracking of assignments cannot regularly be done through the team logbook as was done before when the status of a particular request can be easily checked and verified in the logbook and followed up if needed. Out of 58 pending requests for opinion as of December 31, 2020, 32 were released in the months of January and February 2021, leaving a balance of 26 to be acted upon which still in the R2R Policy.



	14)	The GCC further explained that the Records Officer and the in-charge of Information Technology (IT) matters had been instructed to device a Weekly Monitoring System of pending request. Accordingly, a committee was created to study/plan proposal for the procurement of data application software for the improvement of the records management.



3)	Submission of Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) with supporting documents for transactions covering January to August 2020 amounting to ₱116,293,268.60 to the AT was delayed by 105 to 188 days. Thus, timely verification of transactions could not be conducted. On the other hand, financial accounts for the period September to December 2020 totaling ₱70,506,401.96 were not submitted as of this report contrary to Section 100 of PD No. 1445.



	1)	Section 100 of PD 1445 provides that: Disbursing Officers in any government agency shall render monthly reports of their transactions pursuant to regulations of the Commission to be submitted not later than the fifth day of the ensuing month to the Auditor concerned who shall conduct the necessary examination and audit within thirty days from the receipt thereof.



	2)	For CY 2020, the DVs and its supporting documents for the period January to August 2020 were submitted beyond the prescribed period.  Details are as follows:

	3)	As can be gleaned from the preceding table, delay in the submission of DVs and supporting documents ranges from 105 to 188 days.



	4)	On the other hand, DVs for the months of September to December 2020 totaling ₱70,506,401.96 are yet to be submitted as of this report.  Meaning, the transactions incurred for the period September to December, 2020 were not verified and audited; thus, not included as basis in rendering opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements that marked 38 percent of the total disbursements of ₱186,799,670.56 for CY 2020.



	5)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to immediately transmit DVs including its supporting documents for the period September to December, 2020 to the Audit Team.  Henceforth, design strategies to take into consideration the challenges posed by the current situation to ensure that DVs and its supporting documents are submitted within the prescribed period.



Management Comment



	6)	Management justified that the delay was due to implementations of AWA and Skeletal Work Arrangement (SWA) during this time of pandemic. Thus, limiting the office hours of the staff-n-charge in filing and sorting documents, as well as scanning of all documents before forwarding the same to the AT.



4)	Gender and Development



	1)					Based on the Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Budgets submitted to Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), OGCC budgeted the amount of ₱13,484,000.00 for GAD related activities for CY 2020 which is 7.29 percent of the total appropriations of ₱185,057,000.00. However, it was noted that only ₱4,275,000.00 was spent for the purpose. Most of the planned activities were not implemented due to the unexpected occurrence of COVID 19 pandemic.

				

	2)					Except for the purchase of service vehicle in the amount of ₱3,906,000.00 to be used in conducting GAD activities such as Outreach Program - Free Legal Counselling and Medical Caravan, other planned activities were cancelled and replaced by the following activities with expenses incurred amounting to P369,000:

5)	Mandatory Appropriations for Persons with Disabilities (RA No. 7277)



	1)					Management had substantially complied with the requirements of Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA of 2020 which requires all agencies of the government to formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and differently abled person and integrate the same in their regular activities. It also provides that all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide architectural facilities or structural features and designs that shall reasonably enhance the mobility, safety, and welfare of differently abled persons pursuant to B.P. Bldg. 344 and R.A. No. 7277, as amended.

				

	2)					Wheelchair mobility and the evacuation plans of management prioritize the needs of the elderly and persons with disabilities. The building occupied by OGCC has wheelchair mobility ramps and elevator.

				

	3)					The OGCC budgeted the amount of ₱1,850,570.00. for activities and programs intended for senior citizen and persons with disability.  Since the imposition of lockdown and strict no face-to-face meeting policy during this COVID -19 Pandemic, the OGCC opted to   conduct two Outreach Program that caters the basic needs of the community specially the Seniors and PWDs.

				

	4)					The Outreach Program is intended to help those affected by economic shutdown even in a small amount. The first activity was conducted on April 17-18, 2020 at Barangay Pansol, Quezon City. The amount generated from own pocket of OGCC employees was able to procure grocery items and distributed to the intended households. The second activity was conducted on November 30, 2020 in Barangay Sta Ana, San Mateo and Barangay Malanday in Marikina. Food packs were served at no cost to the office. Only the miscellaneous expenses were budgeted in the amount of ₱20,000.00 to cover the cost of committee’s expenses.

				

				

				

				

				

				

				

6)	Compliance with Tax Laws, Rules and Regulations including the GSIS and Pag-IBIG.
