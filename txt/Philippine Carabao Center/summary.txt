Executive Summary 
 

A. Introduction  

 

The Philippine Carabao Center (PCC) is one of the attached agencies of the Department of 

Agriculture (DA), created by virtue of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7307, otherwise known as 

the Philippine Carabao Act of 1992, to institutionalize the Carabao Development Program 

of the government. Specifically, PCC was operationalized on April 1, 1993 to conserve, 

propagate, and promote the carabao as a source of draft animal power, meat, milk, and hide 

for the benefit of rural farmers particularly smallholder-farmers and Comprehensive 

Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) beneficiaries through carabao genetic improvement, 

technology development and dissemination, and establishment of carabao-based enterprises, 

thus, ensuring higher income and better nutrition of rural farming communities.  It has a 

network of 12 centers strategically situated in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Likewise, the 

PCC is the national lead agency for livestock biotechnology research and development in 

the DA per Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 9, series of 2008. 

 

The PCC is headed by Executive Director Arnel N. Del Barrio until his retirement in October 

2020 and his successor was Dr. Claro N. Mingala who was designated as OIC – Executive 

Director. He is being supported by Deputy Executive Director Caro B. Salces, 12 Center 

Directors, and 194 rank and file employees.

D. Independent Auditor’s Report 

             

As discussed in Part II of this Report, various accounting errors and omissions remained 

unadjusted/uncorrected as at year-end, thus, affecting the fairness of presentation of the 

different accounts in the financial statements such as (a) unrecorded and unadjusted 

reconciling items by the Philippine Carabao Center at Visayas State University (PCC at 

VSU), understating the Cash account by ₱9,188,862.72; (b) unreconciled variance of 



iii 

 

₱406,476.00 between the Bank’s and Agency’s records as reported by the Central Mindanao 

University (CMU);   (c) error in the valuation and recognition of losses of animals thru death, 

understating Other Receivables by ₱79,539,221.99; and (d) overstatement of the recorded 

Property, Plant and Equipment by  ₱11,783,587.53 due to (i) non-provision of depreciation 

for some PPE items which overstated the Assets account by ₱9,702,730.77; (ii) non-

derecognition of donated machineries and equipment worth ₱5,131,070.35; (iii) erroneous 

recognition of procured properties costing ₱714,994.00; (iv) non-reclassification of 

unserviceable properties amounting to ₱616,637.36 from Other Assets account to proper 

PPE accounts and non-disposal of the same; (v) overstatement of intra-agency transferred 

PPEs of ₱70,792.52; (vi) non-reclassification of completed infrastructure project of  

₱3,116,480.76 from the Construction in Progress (CIP) to Other Structures account; and (vii) 

non-provision of depreciation of ₱197,377.11 for completed CIP.  

 

In view of the foregoing, we recommended and the OIC-Executive Director agreed 

to undertake the following courses of action: 

 

 On Cash and Cash Equivalent accounts 
 

a) instruct the Center Directors of PCC at VSU and CMU to require the 
Accountant/Bookkeeper to (i) look into the details of the unrecorded reconciling 

items totaling to ₱9,711,818.77; (ii) effect proper adjustment of the identified 

reconciling items and errors in the books of accounts; (iii) henceforth, observe 

prudence in the recording of transactions to avoid errors; (iv) coordinate with the 

VSU Cashier’s Division for the release of the RCI together with the paid vouchers, 

and  a report on the unreleased checks still at the Cashier’s Office to ensure the 

completeness and accuracy in the booking up of the transactions; and (v) request a 

copy of the tax remittances from the VSU Accounting Office for their proper 

recording in the books;  

 

b)  direct the Center Director of PCC at CMU to instruct the Accounting Office to 

validate and reconcile the variance of ₱406,476.00.  

 

 On Receivables accounts 
 

c)  instruct the Accounting Unit to determine and recognize the correct amount of 

receivables in the books of accounts. 

 

 On Property, Plant and Equipment accounts 
 

d) direct the PC Center Directors concerned to instruct the respective 

Accountant/Bookkeeper to (i) provide allowance for depreciation on PPE items; (ii) 

derecognize the donated machineries and equipment; (iii) recognize PPE items 

erroneously treated as supplies in their respective records; and (iv) draw the 

necessary journal entry vouchers (JEVs) to correct the affected accounts in the books 

to present fairly in the financial statements.

E. Summary of Other Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 

 

Summarized below are the other significant audit observations with their recommendations, 

the details of which are presented in Part II of this report. Management views and comments 

were incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

         

1.  The Agency’s non-compliance with the provisions of the Government Accounting 

Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, on the proper 

valuation and recognition of breeding stocks and biological assets resulted in in the net 

understatement of Assets and Income by ₱122,600.00 and ₱1,677,000.00, respectively, and 

net understatement of Expenses by ₱1,554,400.00.  (Audit Observation No. 5) 

 

We recommended that the OIC-Executive Director instruct the respective Center Directors 

to direct the offices/units concerned to (a) consistently apply the valuation policy established 

by the PCC on Biological Assets; (b) recognize the calves produced and animals acquired in 

their respective records; (c) draw the necessary journal entry voucher (JEV) correcting the 

undervaluation of the animals; and (d) derecognize the dead animals in the books of 

accounts.   

 

2.  The accuracy and validity of some items reported under Financial Liabilities 

accounts were uncertain due to (a) unsubstantiated recognition of payables amounting to 

₱5,088,349.39; (b) unrecognized liabilities for delivered/accepted supplies and materials 

worth ₱305,394.26; and (c) unsupported adjustments reducing Accounts Payable by 

₱823,713.66.  In sum, Financial Liabilities was overstated by a net amount of ₱3,959,241.47.  

(Observation No. 6) 

 

We recommended that the Executive Director instruct the Accountant concerned to (a) 

submit to the Audit Team the documents to support the recognition of payables as at year-

end for verification; (b) record as payables those obligations which have become due and 

demandable based on complete documentary requirements to warrant the validity and 

legality thereof; and (c) henceforth, ensure the submission of the required Journal Entry 

Vouchers (JEVs) and supporting documents to substantiate the adjusting/correcting entries 

made on Accounts Payable. 

 

3.  The procurement of ₱16,100,200.00 worth of fresh carabao’s milk sourced from the 

local dairy farmers and cooperatives was successfully undertaken by the Philippine Carabao 

Center-National Headquarters Gene Pool (PCC NHGP) during calendar year 2020, 

benefitting 90,020 undernourished children enrolled under the DepEd Milk Feeding 

Program. Nonetheless, deficiencies and flaws were noted in the contract preparation and 

implementation phases, thus, contrary to relevant laws, rules and regulations.  (Observation 

No. 9) 

 

We commended the management of PCC NHGP and PCC at UPLB for the smooth 

implementation of the Milk Feeding Program in its first year of operation, and recommended 

that the Executive Director instruct the BAC and other officials and employees concerned 

to  (a) ensure complete documentation of the transactions in compliance with the Contract 



v 

 

Agreement; (b) strictly comply with the prescribed period of contract execution or the 

issuance of Notice of Award and Notice to Proceed; and (c) see to it that the publication of 

the necessary information and procurement documents relative to the Milk Feeding Program 

is carried out in all required avenues within seven working days from the date of acceptance 

of the award. 

 

4.  The Modified “Paiwi” or Trusteeship Scheme of the Dairy Buffalo Module Program 

(DMBP) of the Philippine Carabao Center (PCC) has substantially attained its objective of 

providing additional income to the farmer-beneficiaries for the last two years covering CYs 

2018 to 2019, realized from the milk produced and calves born, with a total amount of 

₱200,029,594.16. However, for the same period, 102 instances of deaths and 167 cases of 

culling of buffaloes occurred due to health issues, thus, hindering the efficient 

implementation and attainment of optimum program results. Similarly, measures undertaken 

to mitigate the loss of buffaloes thru death at the NGP Center were fairly effective as 

manifested by the (a) decrease in mortality of three heads; (b) the decline in the number of 

deaths caused by ruminal tympany/bloat from nine to two heads during the year 2020; and 

(c) culling of animals with poor body condition dropped from 23 heads to four. The 

mortalities and culling of animals, regardless of cause, still posed a threat to the preservation 

of the animals that would otherwise contribute to the sustainability of the Agency’s Genetic 

Improvement Program. (Observation No. 10) 

 

We recommended and the OIC –Executive Director agreed to undertake the following 

courses of action: (a) reassess workloads as well as the duties and responsibilities of the 

veterinarians and personnel responsible for the monitoring of the 7,657 buffaloes entrusted 

to the different farmer-beneficiaries of different cooperatives in Nueva Ecija;  (b) consider 

hiring additional veterinarians/staff or revision of their duties and responsibilities if the result 

of reassessment requires for it; (c) encourage the farmer-beneficiaries to immediately report 

the health condition of their animals for immediate medical attention; (d) if possible, revisit 

the policies and guidelines of the “PAIWI” Scheme and institute safeguards to prevent 

numerous deaths and culling of animals; and  (e) consider the statement under the dispositive 

portion of COA Decision No. 2018-450 dated December 21, 2018 encouraging the PCC to 

conduct thorough investigation on the deaths of the buffaloes to prevent further loss of 

government property. 

 

5.  Audit of the implementation of the Province-Wide Carabao-Based Business 

Improvement (CBIN) of the different Philippine Carabao Centers (PCCs) disclosed 

observations, such as (a) delayed project implementation; (b) late dispersal of animals to 

intended beneficiaries; (c) unsubstantiated distribution of buffaloes; (d) no provision in the 

Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) on the acquisition and disposition of motor 

vehicles/equipment turned over to a Cooperative; (e ) breach of contract resulting in 

undelivered buffaloes while animal/zoological supplies were distributed to a non-legitimate 

recipient; and (f) absence of list of intended farmer-beneficiaries. Such lapses hindered the 

full attainment of the objectives of the Program and the enjoyment of the benefits by the 

beneficiaries thereof. (Observation No. 11) 

 

We recommended and management agreed to direct the respective Center Director to: 



vi 

 

 PCC at Central Luzon State University 
 

a)  instruct the Program Coordinator and other officials/personnel concerned to (i) 
formulate physical plans for future programs that are attainable within the target 

period considering the constraints encountered in the implementation of existing 

programs; and (ii) ensure the attainment of optimum expected benefits from the 

program to the advantage of the intended beneficiaries thru effective planning. 

 

 PCC at Central Mindanao University 
 

b)  make constant follow ups with the PCC Headquarters for the early conduct of 
bidding to catch up with the implementation schedule of the project and maximize 

the utilization of funds; and (b) fast track the implementation of the identified 

projects as planned (dispersal of buffalos to the targetted beneficiaries, installation 

of the milk processing equipment and construction of the required structures) for the 

benefit of the farmers as well as the general public. 

 

 PCC at Don Mariano Marcos State University 
 

c) retrieve the MOA duly signed by the recipients in order to fully support the 
distribution of the buffaloes and at the same time relieve the Center from liability in 

cases of losses or deaths of the animals. 

 

 PCC at La Carlota State University 
 

d)  revisit the existing MOA and prepare amendments thereto so that the responsibilities 
and obligations of both parties pertaining to the assets purchased and turned over to 

the Cooperative will be clearly specified therein. 

 

 PCC at Mariano Marcos University 
 

e) bestow to the Center autonomy in the procurement of its projects, goods and services 
for timely enjoyment and effective implementation of the program for the benefit of 

its clientele. We further recommended that Management ensure that the funds of the 

aforesaid Program/Project be utilized and spent exclusively for legitimate/targeted 

beneficiaries so as not to deprive them of the intended support and benefits under the 

Program.   

 

 PCC at U.P. Los Baňos 
 

f) strictly enforce the delivery of buffaloes within the approved extension period given 
to the contractor; submit the list of intended farmer-beneficiaries in Palawan of the 

said buffaloes; and comply strictly with the prescribed period on the submission of 

copies of Purchase Orders (P.O.s) and perfected contracts and their supporting 

documents pursuant to COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009.
