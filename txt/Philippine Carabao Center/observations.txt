PART II – AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

The audit of financial transactions and operations of the Philippine Carabao Center 

(PCC) for calendar year 2020 disclosed some observations that needed improvements 

and/or corrections. Our observations with the corresponding recommendations are 

discussed in detail in the succeeding paragraphs. 

 

A. Financial and Compliance Audit 

 

Understated Cash and Cash Equivalent accounts - ₱9.19 Million  

 

1. The reported balances of the Cash and Cash Equivalents account were not fairly 
presented in the year-end financial statements due to (a) accumulation of unrecorded 

and unadjusted reconciling items by the Philippine Carabao Center at Visayas State 

University (PCC at VSU) resulting in an understatement of the Cash account by 

₱9,188,862.72; (b) unreconciled variance of ₱406,476.00 between the Bank’s and 

Agency’s records as reported by the Central Mindanao University (CMU);   and (c) 

non/late preparation of Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRSs) by three PC Centers; 

namely, VSU, CMU, and University of the Philippines –Los Baños (UPLB). 
 

1.1. Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 
Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, prescribes the manner in which the general 

purpose financial statements (GPFS) shall be prepared and presented to ensure 

comparability both with the entity’s financial statements of previous periods and with the 

financial statements of the other entities. 

 

1.2. Section 7 of the same Chapter also states that:  
 

Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial 

performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires faithful 

representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in 

accordance with the definition and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 

revenue, and expenses set out in PPSASs. The application of PPSASs, with 

additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial 

statements that achieve a fair presentation. (Par. 27, PPSAS I). xxx. 

Inappropriate accounting policies are not rectified either by disclosure of 

the accounting policies used, or by notes or explanatory material. (Par. 30, 

PPSAS I) 

  

1.3. The Audit Team assigned at PCC at VSU reported that the said PC Center had 
unrecorded and unadjusted reconciling items as of December 31, 2020 which accumulated 

to ₱10,126,424.58 based on their review of the submitted Bank Reconciliation Statements 

(BRS). Presented below are the details of the reconciling items and the effects on the Cash 

Accounts; viz:

Net effect      ₱9,188,862.72 

 

1.4. Item 2.2 of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the PCC at VSU and 
the Visayas State College of Agriculture (ViSCA), currently known as Visayas State 

University (VSU), dated April 17, 1995, provides, among others, the obligation of ViSCA 

that: 

 

Allow the PCC at ViSCA to utilize the facilities and staff of accounting, 

budget, cash personnel and internal audit divisions, and other VSU offices 

needed in processing business transactions and operation of PCC at ViSCA 

at a cost representing the administrative cost released to the Center. 

 

1.5. Under this arrangement, therefore,  the processing of disbursement vouchers (DVs) 
is facilitated by the VSU and then forwarded to PCC at VSU every 2nd or 3rd week 

following the end of the month together with the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) for 

recording in the books.   However, the Bookkeeper informed the Audit Team that the bases 



48 
 

for her recording of transactions were the actual paid vouchers or the released checks, while 

those that were still in the custody of the VSU Cash Division, awaiting their release to the 

payees, were not recorded in the books. 

 

1.6. On the other hand, the interview with the VSU Accounting Office personnel 
revealed that the recording of PCC transactions was based on the weekly report of RCI 

forwarded to them by the VSU Cash Division together with the paid vouchers and the 

duplicate copies of those unreleased vouchers. These were posted in the Budget Allotment 

Obligation Management (BAOM). The BAOM then generates the Check Disbursement 

Journal (CkDJ) which is compared with the monthly RCI to ensure that they are in 

agreement before posting the entries in the general ledgers (GLs). 

 

1.7. Moreover, the Bookkeeper admitted that the unrecorded credit memoranda dated 
December 17 and 28, 2020 totaling to ₱9,061,467.84 represent fund transfers from the 

Schools Division Office of Leyte for the “Supply and Delivery of Milk for School-Based 

Feeding Program (SBFP) – Milk Feeding Program Component”, which have remained 

unrecorded due to late submission of bank statements for validation, and the delay in the 

receipt of information from the Schools Division Office of Leyte regarding such fund 

transfers. 

 

1.8. The Bookkeeper also explained that the VSU accounting personnel in-charge of the 
monthly tax remittances did not provide adequate supporting documents to enable her to 

record the related transactions resulting in unrecorded tax remittances at year-end.  

 

1.9. The non-adherence to the above-cited requirements of GAM resulted in an 
understatement of the Cash accounts and the appropriate Liability accounts by 

₱9,188,862.72, thus, affecting the fairness of presentation of the reported balances in the 

financial statements. 

 

1.10. Meanwhile, the Audit Team at the Philippine Carabao Center at Central Mindanao 
University (PCC at CMU) reported a variance of ₱406,476.00 between the book and bank 

records as of December 31, 2020, as illustrated below: 

 
Account No. Book Balance Bank Balance Variance 

0352-1139-30 CMU PCC RF ₱20,683,309.98 ₱20,769,243.00 (₱85,933.02) 

0352-1122-16 CMU PCC GF 24,080,666.43 24,401,209.41 (320,542.98) 

Total ₱44,763,976.41 ₱45,170,452.41 (₱406,476.00) 

 

1.11. Review of the latest Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) submitted to the Audit 
Team disclosed that the variance could be attributed to the outstanding checks which 

included issuances as far as September 2019 on top of the unrecorded deposits and other 

terrors.  

 

1.12. Records showed that the Accounting Office has not been compliant with the 
required submission of the BRS. The delay in submission also hindered the finalization of 

the cash examination conducted in CY 2020. Several follow-ups were made by the Audit 

Team; nonetheless, the following were the only ones submitted: 



49 
 

 
Account Number BRS Submitted 

0352-1139-30 CMU PCC RF September 2020 

0352-1122-16 CMU PCC GF May 2020 

 

1.13. Failure of the Accounting Office to submit the required monthly BRS precluded 
both the Audit Team and the Accounting Office from checking the correctness of both the 

bank’s and Agency’s/Entity’s records. Likewise, management is prevented from 

ascertaining the accuracy of its own records and that of the depository bank, and 

institute/recommend the necessary corrections, where appropriate.   

 

1.14. Likewise, it was reported that PCC at VSU failed to submit the Bank Reconciliation 
Statement (BRS) for December 2020 to the Audit Team assigned thereat. The Bookkeeper 

explained that the preparation is still ongoing due to the late receipt of the bank statements 

from the depository bank. 

 

1.15. The non-submission of the BRS prevented the timely conduct of verification; thus, 
Management’s assertions on the accuracy, validity and completeness of the transactions 

could not be promptly established.  Similarly, errors and deficiencies cannot be 

immediately detected and corrected, thereby, defeating the purpose of providing timely and 

significant financial data to the users of the FS. 

 

1.16. The same holds true with the PCC at UPLB which failed to prepare and submit the 
BRS for the month of December 2020 for the current account maintained at Land Bank of 

the Philippines (LBP), University of the Philippines – Los Baños with balance amounting 

to ₱67,383,875.99 as at year end.  

 

1.17. The Audit Team was informed that the authorized signatory of the said current 
account was the former OIC-Director who is currently on study leave. The Management is 

waiting for the letter from the PCC NHGP Executive Director in order to update the 

authorized signatory of their current account at LBP. 

 

1.18.  The foregoing lapses contravened Section 74 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 
1445 and Sections 5 and 7, Chapter 21 of GAM for NGAS, Volume I. 

 

1.19. The said Section of P.D. 1445 states that at the close of each month, depositories 
shall report to the agency head in such form that he may direct, the condition of the agency 

account standing on their books. The head of the agency shall see to it that a reconciliation 

is made between the balance shown in the reports and the balance found in the books of 

the agency. 

 

1.20. On the other hand, Sections 5 and 7, Chapter 21 of GAM for NGAS, Volume I 
provides that: 

 

 The Chief Accountant Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt 

of the Bank Statement together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit 



50 
 

Memoranda (DM), Credit Memoranda (CM) from the (GSB), reconcile the 

balance with the GL and prepare the BRS in four copies. 

 

xxx 

 

The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty days after receipt 

of the monthly BS to the following: 

 

Original    - COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents and JEVs) 

Copy 2     - Head of Agency Entity 

Copy 3    - Accounting Division Unit file 

Copy 4   - Bank, if necessary 

 

1.21. As such, the absence of BRS placed constraint to the respective Audit Teams of 
both PC Centers in   determining the reliability and accuracy of the Cash in Bank account 

balance; thus, the Management’s assertion on the accuracy of the Cash and Cash 

Equivalents account was not established. 

 

1.22. We recommended and the OIC - Executive Director agreed to  (a) instruct the 
Center Directors of PCC at VSU and CMU to require the Accountant/Bookkeeper to 

(i) look into the details of the unrecorded reconciling items totaling to ₱9,711,818.77; 

(ii) effect proper adjustment of the identified reconciling items and errors in the books 

of accounts; (iii) henceforth, observe prudence in the recording of transactions to 

avoid errors; (iv) coordinate with the VSU Cashier’s Division for the release of the 

RCI together with the paid vouchers, and  a report on the unreleased checks still at 

the Cashier’s Office to ensure the completeness and accuracy in the booking up of the 

transactions; and (v) request a copy of the tax remittances from the VSU Accounting 

Office for their proper recording in the books; (b) direct the Center Director of PCC 

at CMU to instruct the Accounting Office to validate and reconcile the variance of 

₱406,476.00; (c) direct the OIC-Center Director of the PCC at UPLB and Center 

Directors of PCC at CMU and VSU to (i)  advise their respective 

Bookkeeper/Accountant to strictly observe the provision on the preparation and 

submission of monthly BRS and immediately submit the December 2020 Bank 

Reconciliation Statements; and (ii) enroll in LBP weAccess which allows clients to 

make selected banking transactions online; and (d) direct the OIC- Center Director 

of PCC at UPLB to instruct the Bookkeeper/Accountant to make representation with 

the LBP depository branch for the documentary requirements in updating the 

authorized signatory. 
 

 

Inaccurate balance of Receivables - ₱79.54Million 

 

2. The losses of animals thru death were valued and recognized based on the 
replacement cost instead of their values at the time of death, understating the recorded 

balance of the Other Receivables account by ₱79,539,221.99, thus, affecting the 



51 
 

Management’s assertion on the fair presentation of the Statement of Financial Position 

as of December 31, 2020. 
 

2.1. During the year 2020, the Commission on Audit Legal Services Sector (COA LSS) 
- Prosecution and Litigation Office (PLO) requested the Audit Team for copies of the 

Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) relative to the derecognition of receivables after the PLO 

relieved various accountable officers from property accountability on account of the loss 

thru death of buffaloes. 

 

2.2. Relatedly, the Audit Team of PCC NHGP was able to retrieve the corresponding 
JEVs from the electronic – New Government Accounting System (e-NGAS) of the 

Philippine Carabao Center (PCC), and noted in several instances that the amounts 

derecognized (Appendix A) were different from the original book values indicated in the 

Appeal Memoranda, as summarized below: 

 
Total Animals Total Original Book Value Total Revalued Amount Difference 

41 ₱ 7,852,640.21 ₱2,584,000.00 ₱5,268,640.21 

 

2.3. The Accountant elucidated that the receivables due from the respective AOs were 
set up in December 2016 when the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 

Government Agencies (NGAs) already took effect. 

 

2.4. Accordingly, management based their policy on the provision of Item 4 of 
Resolution No. 001, Series of 2017 of the Program Management Committee (PMC), 

promulgated during the Committee meeting on January 23 -25, 2017. During that meeting, 

it was resolved that the replacement cost of animals which died from the year 2013 and 

onward shall be equal to the fair value less cost to sell and based on the computation of fair 

value as provided in the same Resolution. 

 

2.5. The said Resolution also provides for the following: 
 

“2. Book value of island born riverine buffaloes. The book value of the 

animal changes after the average productive lifespan of the animal, at 8 

years of age, has been reached to reflect “impairment loss”. 

1. Breeding/Non-breeding stocks buffaloes of PCC shall 
be revalued based on its Fair Value less cost to sale. 

2. Estimated cost to sell of PCC buffaloes regardless of 
breed/classification is 35% of its Fair Value. 

3. Fair Value is computed as follows with reference to 
recently approved “revised Pricing Guidelines for the 

Sale. 

4. Replacement cost of animals which died from 2013 and 
onward is equal to fair value less cost to sell. 

 

2.6. The matrices shown in Appendix B (Schedule of Fair Market Value Computation 
of Buffaloes) were the basis of revaluation by the Management as stated in the aforesaid 

Resolution. 



52 
 

2.7. Interview with the personnel concerned disclosed that the above-cited fair value 
computation matrices were based, among others, from the National Dairy Authority’s 

(NDA) Price for Dairy Animal Per Classification, lactation curve of dams calving at 

different age/season (Farmer Livestock School on Dairy Buffalo Production), and current 

pricing guidelines. 

 

2.8. The Audit Team of PCC NHGP acknowledged the Management’s adherence to the 
provisions of GAM for NGAs and the initiative to formulate an internal policy on the 

determination of fair value of the animals subject of relief. Nevertheless, we find no basis 

for the revaluation of the dead animals for the sake of recognizing the amount of 

accountability of the AOs concerned. Since the death of the animals occurred before the 

approval of the Resolution, the measurement of receivables should have been synchronized 

with the book value of the animals at the time of death. 

 

2.9. Meanwhile, the Other Receivables account in the books of the Philippine Carabao 
Center National Headquarters and Gene Pool (PCC NHGP) as of December 31, 2020 has 

a balance amounting to ₱35,304,374.22 representing the recorded receivables due from 

farmer-recipients/cooperative members who availed of the Buffalo Loan Program under 

the Paiwi Scheme.  The awarded animals died while in their custody, and as of to date, the 

corresponding requests for relief from property accountability are still in process. Likewise, 

there were receivables due from the PCC officers/employees who are the designated 

accountable officers for those dead buffaloes from the Agency’s institutional herd. 

 

2.10. Evaluation by the Audit Team showed that 924 buffaloes recorded at original book 
value of ₱113,032,771.99 were devalued at an aggregate amount of ₱33,493,550.00 when 

they expired in CYs 2010 to 2016. This amount forms part of the balance of the Other 

Receivables account of ₱35,304,374.22 as at year-end. As could be gleaned in the table 

below, out of 924, a total of 125 animals increased its book value by ₱1,214,800.00. 

Meanwhile, the remaining 799 heads decreased in value by ₱80,754,021.99 or a net 

reduction of ₱79,539,221.99 in the Receivables account balance.

2.11. The Accountant stated that the foregoing figures were effected in the books of 
accounts through the following journal entries at the end of December 2016 only: 

 
Account DR CR 

Breeding Stocks ₱ 1,214,800.00  

Gain on Changes in Fair Value Less Cost to Sell Due to 

Physical Change 

 ₱ 1,214,800.00 

To recognize increase in value due to revaluation

Account DR CR

Breeding Stocks  80,754,021.99 

To recognize decrease in value due to revaluation 

   

Loss of Assets 33,493,550.00  

Breeding Stocks  33,493,550.00 

To record the dead animals 

   

Other Receivables 33,493,550.00  

Other Deferred Credits  33,493,550.00 

To recognize receivables 

   

 

2.12. She further stated that the initial recognition of the procured animals and calves 
produced was entered in the books in the following manner: 

 
Account DR CR 

Breeding Stocks xx  

Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account  xx 

To recognize procured animals 

   

Breeding Stocks xx  

Gain on Initial Recognition of Biological Assets  xx 

To recognize calf produced 

 

2.13. It is worth-mentioning that the Accounting Unit’s revaluation of breeding stocks 
was done at year-end commencing in CY 2016 with applicable journal entry presented 

below. 

 
Account DR CR 

Breeding Stocks xx  

Gain on Changes in Fair Value Less Cost to Sell Due to 

Physical Change 

 xx 

To recognize increase in value due to revaluation 

   

Loss on Changes in Fair Value Less Cost to Sell xx  

Breeding Stocks  xx 

To recognize decrease in value due to revaluation 

 

2.14. Section 2(d) and (e), Chapter 11 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) 
for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I defines biological asset as a living 

animal or plant (Par. 9, IPSAS 27) and biological transformation as comprises the 

processes, growth, degeneration, production and procreation that cause qualitative or 

quantitative changes in a biological asset (Par. 9, IPSAS 27), respectively. (underscoring 

ours) 

 

2.15. Likewise, Section 5 (Biological Transformation) of the same Chapter states that 
Biological transformation results in the following types of outcomes: 

 



54 
 

a. Asset changes through: 
 

1. Growth (an increase in quantity or improvement in quality of an animal or 
plant), 

2. Degeneration (a decrease in the quantity or deterioration in quality of an 
animal or plant), or 

3. Procreation (creation of additional living animals or plants); or 
 

b. Production of agricultural produce such as latex, tea leaf, wool, and milk.   
 

2.16. Relatedly, measurement of the assets was provided in its Section 7 that A biological 
asset shall be measured on initial recognition and at each reporting date at its fair value 

less cost to sell, except when market-determined process or values are not available, and 

for which alternative estimates of fair value are determined to be unreliable. In such case, 

that biological asset shall be measured at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and 

any accumulated impairment losses. (Pars. 16 and 34, PPSAS 27) (emphasis ours) 

 

2.17. Based on the above-cited provisions pertaining to Biological Assets in which 
Breeding Stocks was among its sub-account, the Audit Team deduced that the recognition 

of gain or loss resulted in the revaluation at the time when the animals were already dead 

for more than a couple of years, thus, no basis and improper. As such, albeit the dropping 

of the dead animals (which died way back in CYs 2010 to 2016) from the books of accounts 

after the Resolution has been approved, those animals should have been 

dropped/derecognized at their value at the time of death and not at their revalued amount 

since only living animals are eligible for revaluation. 

 

2.18. Further analysis disclosed that the balance of the Other Receivables as at December 
31, 2020 should have been higher at ₱114,843,596.21 instead of ₱35,304,374.22 as 

presented below: 

 
Balance as of December 31, 2020 ₱35,304,374.22 

Add: Net decrease due to revaluation 79,539,221.99 

Should be Balance as of December 31, 2020 ₱114,843,596.21 

 

2.19. We recommended and the OIC – Executive Director agreed to instruct the 
Accounting Unit to determine and recognize the correct amount of receivables in the 

books of accounts. 
 

 

Unreliable balance of Inventory accounts  

 

3.  The reliability of the reported balances of the Inventories account was not 

ascertained due to accounting deficiencies and departure from the regulations embodied 

in the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies 

(NGAs), Volume II, such as (a) unadjusted variances of ₱751,796.66  and ₱253,657.05 

between the Accounting records and the physical count conducted by the Philippine 

Carabao Center-National Headquarters at Gene Pool (NHGP) and PCC at VSU, 



55 
 

respectively; (b) non-recognition of 174 items worth ₱284,581.68 under the 

Animal/Zoological Supplies and Inventory Held for Consumption of the PCC-NHGP. 

Meanwhile, the PCC-UPLB had unrecorded 281 units with undetermined value; and (c) 

erroneous recognition and unsubstantiated inventory issuances of the PCC at VSU and 

unreconciled difference between the RSMI and accounting records in the amount of 

₱1,342,873.92 and ₱149,847.61, respectively.  

 

 The audit of the Inventory accounts disclosed deficiencies affecting the reliability of its 

balance amounting to ₱21,277,998.64 as at December 31, 2020, as discussed below: 

 

(a) Unadjusted variances between the Accounting records and the physical count  
 

3.1 Instruction C of Appendix 66 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 

National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume II, prescribes the maintenance of 

Accounting Books, Registries, Records, Forms and Reports. It further states that the Report 

on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) shall be reconciled with the SLCs and SCs 

maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit, and Property and/or Supply Division/Unit, 

respectively. Any discrepancy shall be verified and/or adjusted accordingly. 

 

3.2 Likewise, the non-reconciliation of balances between the aforesaid reports and 

record was contrary to Section 491 of the GAAM Volume I. The said Manual requires, 

among others, the investigation and reconciliation of noted discrepancies between the 

physical count and Accounting records. 

 

3.3 The Management of PCC NHGP complied with the aforementioned guidelines by 

conducting semi-annual and year-end physical inventory-taking of supplies and materials 

in CY 2020. Comparison of recorded Inventory account balances per Supplies Ledger 

Cards (SLCs) and the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) submitted by 

the Accounting and Property Units, respectively, disclosed net discrepancy of ₱751,796.66 

as presented in the table below: 

 
Inventory Accounts Per SLC Per RPCI Difference 

Accountable Forms ₱     14,500.00          ₱    14,500.00  ₱             0.00   

Animal/Zoological Supplies Inventory          4,380,476.87          3,208,106.16  1,172,370.71

3.4 The Audit Team of PCC NHGP conducted follow-up test counts on January 13 and 

14, 2021 in coordination with the Units concerned to further verify the discrepancies taking 

into consideration the receipts and issuances from year-end up to the date of test counts. 

 

3.5 The results of the validation and test counts showed variances in quantity between 

the SLCs and the physical count valued at ₱768,252.27 as presented in Appendix C, 

resulting in the understatement of the Inventory controlling accounts by the same amount. 



56 
 

3.6 In the same manner, the Audit Team assigned at PCC at VSU reported that the said 

PC Center has unreconciled discrepancy of ₱253,657.05 between the General Ledger (GL) 

and Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RCPI).  

 

3.7 The comparison of the GL and the submitted RCPI disclosed the above discrepancy 

computed as follows: 

 
Account Title GL RPCI Difference 

Animal/Zoological Supplies Inventory ₱ 399,534.77 ₱ 464,696.00 ₱   65,161.23 

Office Supplies Inventory      95,390.13       98,322.30     2,932.17 

Other Supplies and Materials Inventory     109,379.06      294,942.71   185,563.65 

Total ₱ 604,303.96 ₱ 857,961.01 ₱ 253,657.05 

 

3.8 The Bookkeeper of the said PC Center admitted that there was no reconciliation 

made between the inventory accounts maintained at the Accountant’s Office; hence, the 

substantial descrepancies could overstate or understate the GL balance when no adjustment 

would be effected.  

 

3.9 The Audit Team also noted that the following items were unrecorded in the books 

as inventories but were included during the physical count. These discrepancies could also 

be attributed to the non-recording of issuances of supplies and materials based on Report 

of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI). 

 
Article Amount 

Disinfectants             ₱   8,665.00  

Tissue Paper                 790.33

Construction Materials            28,672.70  

Total ₱ 43,572.53  

 

3.10 It is to give emphasis on the importance of the responsibility of the Inventory 

Committee in validating its physical inventory report. The purpose of conducting the 

physical inventory would be defeated if a reconciliation between the accounting records 

and those from the property records is not made. 

 

(b) Non-recognition of Animal/Zoological Supplies and Inventory Held for 
Consumption 

 

3.11 During the Audit Team’s physical validation of the supplies kept at the PCC Gene 

Pool storage area, it was found out that there were 274 items of Animal/Zoological Supplies 

amounting to ₱284,581.68 which were neither included in the SLCs nor in the RPCI as of 

December 31, 2020. The details of which are presented in the succeeding table: 

 
Description Unit Quantity Unit Cost Amount 

Urea Fertilizer bag 131     ₱1,015.28       ₱133,001.68  

Complete Fertilizer (14-14-14) bag 143     1,060.00         151,580.00  

Total  274  ₱284,581.68 

 



57 
 

3.12 The Audit Team further noted that some bags/sacks were already damaged with 

spoiled bits of fertilizers scattered on the floor as shown in the pictures taken at the time of 

validation; viz: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

      

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.13 Meanwhile, the Accountant averred that it has been their practice to directly charge 

to the Expenses account the purchased inventories such as animal/zoological supplies since 

those supplies were instantaneously issued to the end-users. 

 

3.14 Be that as it may, the said practice contradicts the cardinal rule on Perpetual 

Inventory Method which prescribes that purchases of supplies and materials for stock, 

regardless of whether or not they are consumed within the accounting period are recorded 

as Inventory to ensure proper accounting and promote better control in the receipt and 

issuance of supplies and materials. 

 

3.15 The foregoing lapses signaled weaknesses in accounting control over Inventory 

accounts which may eventually expose the assets to risk of loss or misuse. As a result, 

Management’s assertion on the accuracy of Inventory records and reports could not be fully 

relied upon. Likewise, the handling of inventories which remained unutilized was not also 

properly observed. 

 

3.16 The same holds true with PCC at UPLB in which a total of 281 items of inventories 

with unknown value were not recognized in the books of accounts; viz: 

 
Particulars Quantity 

Inventory Held for Consumption  

     Office supplies Inventory 156 

     Fuel, Oil and Lubricants Inventory 49 



58 
 

Particulars Quantity 

     Construction Materials Inventory 55 

     Other Supplies and Materials Inventory 21 

Total 281 

 

3.17 The total value of the aforesaid inventories could not be computed in the absence 

of value per unit in the submitted report, hence casting doubt whether reconciliation of 

accounts between the Accounting and Supply Sections had been made in CY 2020 after 

physical inventory was conducted. 

 

3.18 The RPCI submitted to the Audit Team assigned thereat was not fully accomplished 

in accordance with the prescribed format since the preparer failed to disclose important 

information/data, such as the Article, Balance per Card, Quantity and Value of 

Shortage/Overage and Remarks columns which determine the whereabouts, conditions and 

other relevant information on the inventories noted during the physical count. 

 

3.19 The reference and recipient office/unit columns in the Stock Cards were not filled-

up by the Supply Officer upon issuance of the related supplies. Also, the Supply Officer 

failed to prepare and maintain Stock Cards for Other Supplies and Materials Inventory 

under Revolving Fund or the supplies needed in the day-to-day operations of the Milka 

Krem. 

 

3.20 The occurrence of the above-mentioned observations precluded the Audit Team to 

fully ascertain the accuracy and reliability of these accounts as presented in the Statement 

of Financial Position. 

 

(c) Erroneous recognition and unsubstantiated recording of inventory issuances by 
PCC at VSU - ₱1,342,873.92 

 

3.21 Verification of the Audit Team of PCC at VSU of the accounting records revealed 

that the entries made to record the issuances of supplies and materials to end-users totaling 

₱1,342,873.92 were not supported with pertinent RSMIs, as presented in the succeeding 

table.

3.22 The Bookkeeper admitted the continuous practice of deducting from the GL the 

balance from the Schedule of Inventory Accounts to arrive at the amount of issued supplies 



59 
 

and materials to be credited to the specific inventory accounts and in order to arrive at a 

balancing figure as at year-end, as illustrated below:

3.23 It was also noted that while monthly RSMIs were prepared in compliance with a 

previous audit recommendation, the report was not used by the Bookkeeper as basis of 

recording the inventories issued to end-users, resulting in a difference of ₱149,847.61 upon 

comparing the prepared reports against the recorded issuances; to wit: 

 

Account Title RSMI 
Recorded 

Issuances

Animal/Zoological Supplies Inventory ₱ 1,290,617.00 ₱ 1,123,704.47  ₱   166,912.53

Other Supplies and Materials Inventory 86,088.61 114,414.96 (28,326.35) 

Total ₱ 1,492,721.53 ₱ 1,342,873.92 ₱   149,847.61 

 

3.24 The Audit Team wish to emphasize that the RSMI is a report prepared by the 

Supply and/or Property Division to account and summarize all items issued during the day 

on a monthly basis.  At the end of the month, all RSMIs will be consolidated by the 

Accounting Division/Unit for the preparation of Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to recognize 

the issued supplies/materials under the proper account. 

 

3.25 Furthermore, review of the Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) maintained by the 

Accounting Division/Unit on a sampling basis disclosed that entries reflected therein 

pertained only to the receipt of inventory items. The issued inventories were not recorded 

in the SLCs during the period of their actual issuance. 

 

3.26 The Bookkeeper explained that she has difficulty in keeping track of the 

movements of the inventories due to delayed submission of the related transaction 

documents for the purchase of supplies and materials. By the time they are submitted and 

received by their Office, the inventories were already issued to the end-users. 

 

3.27 The SLC is important and should be kept updated for it is used to record all 

purchases and their issuances as clearly provided in the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1.  

Likewise, the IAR, RIS, RSMI, PO and DR shall serve as source documents for the 

recording of issued items. 

 



60 
 

3.28 The deficiencies mentioned previously resulted in the procedural lapses in the 

recording of inventories which affected the veracity of the balances of the Inventory Held 

for Consumption account in the financial statements of PCC at VSU. 

 

3.29 The foregoing lapses of PCC Management signified weaknesses and ineffective 

accounting control over inventory accounts which eventually may expose the assets to risk 

of loss or misuse. As a result, Management’s assertion on the accuracy and valuation of 

the reported Inventory accounts of PCC amounting to ₱21,277,998.64 as of December 31, 

2020 could not be relied upon. 

 

3.30 We recommended that the OIC - Executive Director direct the respective 

Center Director concerned to instruct the (a) Accounting and Property Units to (i) 

reconcile the actual physical inventory of every inventory item with noted variances 

against the actual count at year-end and effect the necessary adjustment in the books, 

if warranted; (ii) recognize in their respective records all inventory items found at the 

storage area following the Perpetual Inventory Method; and (b) Property and Supply 

Officer of PCC NHGP to constantly remind the personnel concerned at the Gene Pool 

storage area on the proper manner of handling animal/zoological supplies for stock 

to prevent or at least minimize losses from damaged inventories. 

 

3.31 We further recommended that the OIC - Executive Director advise the Center 

Director of PCC at VSU to instruct the Accountant to (i) review the pertinent 

accounting records with reference to the RSMI summarizing the issued inventories 

in CY 2020 in order to determine the actual amount of the issued items so that proper 

corrections shall be made for the noted unreconciled difference of ₱149,847.61; and 

(ii) update regularly the SLCs by recording promptly the  receipt and issuances of 

inventory items. 

 

 

Unreliable balance of Property, Plant and Equipment accounts - ₱11.78 million 

 

4.  The recorded balances with carrying amount of ₱821,320,391.15 of the Property, 

Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts of the Philippine Carabao Center National 

Headquarters and Gene Pool (NHGP) and three other Regional Centers were overstated 

by a net amount of ₱11,783,587.53 due to deviations from various regulations of the 

Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), 

such as: (a) non-provision of depreciation for some PPE items which overstated the 

Assets account by  ₱9,702,730.77  (b) non-derecognition of donated machineries and 

equipment worth ₱5,131,070.35; (c) erroneous recognition of procured properties 

costing ₱714,994.00; (d) non-reclassification of unserviceable properties amounting to 

₱616,637.36 from Other Assets account to proper PPE accounts and non-disposal of the 

same; (e) overstatement of intra-agency transferred PPEs of ₱70,792.52; (f) non-

reclassification of completed infrastructure project of  ₱3,116,480.76 from the 

Construction in Progress (CIP) to Other Structures account; and (g) non-provision of 

depreciation of ₱197,377.11 for completed CIP.

4.1 In the audit of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts of the Philippine 

Carabao Center National Headquarters and Gene Pool (PCC NHGP) and its Philippine 

Carabao Centers (PC Centers) in the different Regions, the following were the carrying

4.2 Section 27(c), Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 

National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, prescribes the policy on depreciation 

of an asset; to wit: 

 

Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it 

is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating 

in the manner intended by management. xxx. 

 

4.3 The Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 

disclosed that the PCC NHGP adopted the policy on initial recognition of depreciation as 

prescribed under the aforementioned provision.  However, it was not fully adopted as there 

were some recognized PPE items in the books which were not provided with allowance for 

depreciation; to wit:

4.4 Collectively, the non-provision of depreciation for some PPE items totaling to 

₱493,429.20 resulted in the understatement of corresponding expenses and accumulated 



62 
 

depreciation accounts, and consequently in the incorrect valuation of the affected PPE 

accounts in the Statement of Financial Position (SFP) as of year-end. 

 

4.5 Similarly, in the case of the Philippine Carabao Center at Central Luzon State 

University (PCC at CLSU), there were also some recognized PPE items in the books valued 

at ₱1,148,921.00 which were not provided with allowance for depreciation as shown in the

4.6 Interview with the Accountant and the Bookkeeper disclosed that the non-provision 

of depreciation could be attributed to error in the classification of depreciable and non-

depreciable assets in the electronic New Government Accounting System (e-NGAS). 

 

4.7 Based on the re-computation made by the Audit Team of PCC at CLSU, unrecorded 

accumulated depreciation amounted to ₱726,791.36 as of December 31, 2020, as presented 

in the succeeding table:

4.8 In view of the foregoing accounting errors and omissions, the Accumulated 

Depreciation Account was understated by ₱726,791.36, thus, ultimately overstating the 

Property, Plant and Equipment accounts by the same amount. Likewise, Accumulated 

Surplus and Prior Year’s Adjustment accounts were overstated by ₱63,306.38 and 

₱663,484.98, respectively. 

 

4.9 Likewise, the Audit Team Leader of the Philippine Carabao Center at University 

of the Philippines – Los Banos (PCC at UPLB) reported an understatement of 

₱8,226,095.42 in the Accumulated Depreciation accounts as at year-end due to erroneous 

computation of depreciation in the current and prior years; viz:

4.10 The error in computation of the above-cited PPEs resulted in the understatement of 

the corresponding Accumulated Depreciation accounts, and overstatement of the PPE 

accounts and Accumulated Surplus account by the same amount of ₱8,226,095.42. 

 

4.11 Meanwhile, the Audit Team Leader of Philippine Carabao Center at Visayas State 

University (PCC at VSU) recounted that several fully depreciated equipment costing 

₱1,052,497.40 are still carried in the books above their residual value due to provision of 

depreciation for a few months only in some equipment. The non-provision of depreciation 

throughout the economic life or until the assets become unserviceable resulted in the 

overstatement of PPE accounts by ₱749,843.99 as shown in the preceding table.

b) Non-derecognition of donated machineries and equipment -₱5,131,070.35 
 

4.12 Section 15, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 

Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, provides that transfer from one government 

entity to another shall be recognized by the recipient entity at net carrying value. The 

transferor shall derecognize the PPE account upon transfer. (emphasis supplied) 

 

4.13 Connectedly, Section 39, Chapter 10 of the same Manual provides for the following 

principle on the derecognition of PPE: 

 

Sec. 39. Derecognition. The cost of the PPE together with the related 

accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss shall be 

removed from the accounts (2014 ed. Financial Accounting, Volume I, 

Valix). The carrying amount of an item of PPE shall be derecognized on 

disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is 

expected from its use or disposal. 

 

4.14 In compliance with the prior year’s audit recommendation to undertake appropriate 

disposal of idle and unserviceable properties, the PCC NHGP transferred some of its idle 

and unserviceable properties to other PCC Regional Centers and public schools with prior 

request for such transfer of properties and approved by the agency head. The reason for 

transfers was mainly due to donation for educational, official and for training purposes as 

indicated in the Property Transfer Reports (PTRs). 

 

4.15 Nevertheless, we noted that some donated machineries and equipment for 

₱1,564,199.09 (net) were still included in the PPE Schedule and the Report on the Physical 

Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) maintained by the Accounting and 

Property Units, respectively, detailed in Appendix D, and summarized below:

4.16 Interview with the personnel concerned from the Accounting Unit disclosed that 

the Property Unit submitted copies of the PTRs, which served as the basis for 

derecognizing the said PPEs from the books of accounts. Meanwhile, in compliance with 

the prior year’s audit recommendation, the Accountant had already derecognized some 

unserviceable properties previously classified under the Other Assets account.  However, 

she admitted that the preparation of JEV to derecognize donated PPEs was overlooked 

which resulted in the overstatement of the PPE and Accumulated Depreciation accounts by 



65 
 

₱5,131,070.35 and ₱3,566,871.26, respectively, and understatement of Donations account 

by ₱1,564,199.09.  

 

c) Erroneous recognition of procured equipment-₱714,994.00 
 

4.17 Section 3, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides for the following 

recognition principles applicable to PPE: 

 

Sec. 3. Criteria for Recognition. The cost of an item of PPE shall be 

recognized as assets if, and only if: 

 

a. it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential 

associated   with the item will flow to the entity; 

b. the cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably;  

c. beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the government; 

d. the asset is used to achieve government objectives; and 

e. it meets the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000. 
 
4.18 Vouching of disbursement vouchers (DVs) of PCC NHGP during the year 2020 

revealed that acquisitions of equipment totaling to ₱714,994.00 were inadvertently 

recognized under the Office Supplies Expenses and Animal/Zoological Supplies Inventory 

accounts instead of recognizing the appropriate PPE accounts, as presented in the 

succeeding table:

4.19 All of the above-mentioned machineries and equipment were functional and 

currently utilized in the agency operations, thus, would qualify in all the criteria set-forth 

under Section 3, Chapter 10 of the said Manual. 

 

4.20 Consequently, the unrecognized machineries and equipment resulted in the 

understatement of the PPE accounts by ₱714,994.00 and overstatement of Office Supplies 

Expenses and Animal/Zoological Supplies Inventory accounts by ₱415,000.00 and 

₱299,994.00, respectively.

d) Derecognized PPE items still recorded in the books- ₱134,180.94 
 

4.21 Review of the PPE Schedules of PCC NHGP extracted from the electronic New 

Government Accounting System (eNGAS) showed that some derecognized PPE items 

totaling to ₱134,180.94 still have existing balances as presented in the table below:

Total  ₱  0.00 ₱ (134,180.94) ₱134,180.94 

 

4.21 The Agency donated one unit vortex mixer (with Property Number OED14-040) to 

the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) as per PTR No. 16-030 dated June 1, 2016. The 

donation was recognized in the books of accounts by debiting Financial Assistance to 

National Government Agencies (NGAs) and crediting the Technical and Scientific account 

in the amount equivalent to the acquisition cost of the PPE item. No corresponding 

adjustment was made to the Accumulated Depreciation account totaling to ₱2,960.94; thus, 

a balance of the same amount was left under the PPE account.  

 

4.22 Three units of mother tanks were transferred to PCC at Ubay Stock Farm (USF) on 

May 30, 2019 and were erroneously derecognized in the books of accounts by debiting 

Accumulated Depreciation equivalent to the total carrying value of the three PPE items, 

thus, leaving a balance of ₱34,180.94. 

 

4.23 Owing to the afore-cited lapses, the reported PPE balances were overstated by a 

sum of ₱134,180.94. 

 

e) Overstatement of intra-agency transferred PPEs-₱70,792.52 
 

4.24 Section 14, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides the following 

guidelines on the transfers of PPE, which we quote: 

 

Sec. 14. Intra-agency transfers of PPE (from Central Office to Regional 

Offices/Staff Bureaus or vice versa). These shall be recognized at the 

carrying amount of the asset received. The receiving department/office shall 

recognize the asset at its original historical cost less accumulated 

depreciation and accumulated impairment loss. 

 

4.25 Verification of the PPE Ledger Cards (PPELCs) of PCC at CLSU maintained by 

the Accounting Unit and the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and 

Equipment (RPCPPE) prepared by the Property Unit disclosed that some PPE items were 



67 
 

transfers to the said PC Center from the PCC National Headquarters and Gene Pool 

(NHGP) as indicated in the Property Transfer Report (PTR).  

 

4.26 However, we noted discrepancies between the PPELC and RPCPPE vis-à-vis the 

PTR, as presented in the table below:

Total ₱306,801.30  ₱538,796.52       ₱468,004.00       ₱70,792.52  

 

4.27 It can be gleaned from the preceding table that the recognition of intra-agency 

transferred PPE items was not based on original historical cost as prescribed under Section 

14, Chapter 10, supra. 

 

4.28 Further review of the journal entry vouchers (JEVs) revealed that the 

aforementioned PPE items of ₱306,801.30 were based on the carrying amount (cost less 

accumulated depreciation) at the time of transfer and not based on the acquisition cost as 

indicated in the PTR, thus, overstating the PPE controlling accounts by ₱70,792.52.   

 

f) Non-reclassification of unserviceable properties from Other Assets account to 
proper PPE accounts and non-disposal thereof- ₱2,757,570.16 

 

4.29 COA Circular No. 2014-003 dated 15 April 2014 provides, among others, the 

procedures in the conversion of accounts effective January 01, 2014 to conform with the 

new and revised accounting policies.  

 

4.30 Relative thereto, the Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) for National Government 

Agencies prescribed under COA Circular No. 2013-002 dated January 30, 2013 partly 

states that Other Assets account shall be comprised only of the items enumerated in the 

following table together with its respective contra-asset account: 

 
Other Assets Account Code under RCA 

Acquired Assets 19999010 

Foreclosed Property/Assets 19999020 

Forfeited Property/Assets 19999030 

Confiscated Property/Assets 19999040 

Abandoned/Surrendered Property/Assets 19999050 

Other Assets 19999090 

 



68 
 

4.31 The review of the accounting record of the Philippine Carabao Center at Cagayan 

State University (PCC at CSU) by the Audit Team disclosed that the said PC Center has 

an undisposed unserviceable property amounting to ₱315,098.35 as at December 31, 2020 

which   were not reclassified to their proper PPE accounts and remained under Other Assets 

accounts contrary to the aforementioned Circulars. 

 

4.32 The non-reclassification of the said properties was not only inconsistent with the 

aforesaid Circulars but also resulted in the overstatement of Other Assets account by 

₱315,098.35 while the affected PPE accounts were collectively understated by the same 

amount as of year-end. Additionally, the corresponding allowance for impairment and 

depreciation were likewise not provided so as to reflect their carrying values. 

 

4.33 The same is true with PCC at UPLB as reported by the Audit Team Leader assigned 

thereat. A total of 85 unserviceable PPEs with salvage value amounting to ₱616,637.36 

remained recorded under the Other Assets account instead of reclassified to their proper 

PPE accounts resulting in the understatement of PPE accounts and overstating the Other 

Assets account by the same amount, as summarized in the table below: 

 

Particulars 
Number of 

Units 
Acquisition Cost Salvage Value 

Office Equipment 1 ₱   107,000.00 ₱   10,700.00

Total 85 units ₱ 6,166,373.63   ₱ 616,637.36 

 

4.34 Reportedly, the said unserviceable properties of both PCC at CSU and PCC at 

UPLB were not yet disposed of exposing the same to various hazards which reduced their 

recoverable value and deprived the respective PC Center of a higher gain had these PPEs 

been sold immediately.   
 

4.35 The non-disposal of the property contravened Section 79 of Presidential Decree 

(P.D.) No. 1445 which provides the policies and procedures on unserviceable property; to 

wit: 

 

When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is 

no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable 

therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized 

representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be 

valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be 

valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the 

supervision of the proper committee an award or similar body in the 

presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative 

of the Commission, after advertising by printed notice in the Official 

Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of 



69 
 

general circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the 

expense of publication, by notices posted for a like period in at least three 

public places in the locality where the property is to be sold. In the event 

that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at 

such price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned and 

approved by the Commission.  

 

(g) Non-closure of completed project from the CIP account to Other Structures 
(₱3,116,480.76) and non-provision of related depreciation (₱197,377.11)  

 

4.36 One completed infrastructure project of PCC at CLSU worth ₱3,116,480.76 was 

not reclassified from the Construction in Progress (CIP) account to Other Structures 

contrary to Section 8(g), Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 

National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. Moreover, the completion of the water 

system structure costing ₱2,609,075.30 was delayed, depriving the PCC-CLSU of 

immediate benefits that could be derived from uninterrupted water supply for its daily 

operations.  

 

4.37 Section 8(g), Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 

National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, states, among others, the following 

guidelines on the purchase of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) by construction: 

 

Construction of PPE. During the construction period, all expenses incurred in 

relation to the construction of the PPE shall be taken up in the books as 

Construction in Progress (CIP) with the appropriate asset classification. As 

soon as the construction is completed, the “Construction in Progress” 

account shall be reclassified to the proper asset account. xxx (emphasis 

supplied) 

 

4.38 As of December 31, 2020, the CIP account of PCC at CLSU comprises the 

following buildings and other structures:

Total  ₱5,725,556.06 

  

4.40 Interview with the Accountant disclosed that the reclassification of the completed 

structure from the CIP account to Other Structures account was overlooked owing to the 

delayed processing of the final payment for the project.  

 

4.41 Meanwhile, the project “Deep Well Drilling at PCC at CLSU” was still 80% 

completed based on the Statement of Work Accomplished (SWA) and Certificate of 

Inspection prepared by the PCC Inspectorate Team on July 22, 2019. The contract duration 

originally was 60 calendar days (CD) from September 8, 2017 to November 6, 2017. 



70 
 

However, owing to several requests for time extensions and work suspensions by the 

contractor, the project’s duration was revised to 90 CDs beginning April 3, 2019 until July 

2, 2019, as briefly discussed in the sequence of events below: 

 

 October 9, 2017- the Contractor wrote a letter addressed to the CLSU President 
through the PCC at CLSU Center Director, requesting for project suspension due 

to unpassable access road leading to and from the project site which was then 

approved by the officials concerned; 

 May 30, 2018- the Contractor issued a formal letter informing the PCC at CLSU of 
its work resumption; 

 July 30, 2018- the Contractor requested for another work suspension and time 
extension citing continuous heavy rains that washed out the temporary bridge 

leading to the drilling site; 

 August 10, 2018- the PCC-CLSU Center Director favorably recommended to the 
Chairman of the CLSU Project and Program Monitoring and Evaluation Team 

(PAP-MET) the approval of the Contractor’s request dated July 30, 2018; 

 September 19, 2018- the Chairman of the CLSU PAP-MET allowed the 
Contractor’s request for work suspension subject to conditions as enumerated in the 

letter addressed to the Contractor; 

 October 25, 2018- the Chairman of the CLSU PAP-MET formally recommended 
to the CLSU President the termination of contract following the recommendation 

of the University Inspectorate Team due to 63% negative slippage or a total delay 

of 98 CDs in the implementation of the project; 

 October 26, 2018- The CLSU President then wrote a formal letter informing the 
Contractor of the termination of its contract; 

 October 31, 2018- the Contractor requested for reconsideration citing the major set-
back of the project due to massive rock formation at the project site that hindered 

the drilling activities and offered for catch-up plan subject to review by the 

procuring entity; 

 November 27, 2018- based on the Minutes of Regular Meeting of the CLSU PAP-
MET with CLSU Center Director, the body approved the 90-day catch-up plan by 

the Contractor and agreed to relocate the drilling site due to formation of hard rock 

beneath the original site, subject variation order under the change order without any 

additional cost on the part of the PCC-CLSU; and 

 April 3, 2019- Contractor’s request for project resumption was approved by the 
PCC-CLSU Center Director based on 90 CDs catch-up plan. 

 

4.42 The Contractor cited in his position paper dated December 22, 2020 that the project 

was already completed sometime in August 2019. However, the contractor failed to comply 

with the 24-hour pumping test requirement owing to the difficulties encountered during the 

drilling stage of the project. Throughout the initial pumping test, the deep well produced 

waters for just almost two hours and after which it ran out of water. 

 

4.43 As explained by the PCC-CLSU official concerned, the geo-resistivity survey was 

conducted by the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) Office based on the original 

site of the drilling project, requiring 60 meters deep from which water can be possibly 



71 
 

sourced out. On the other hand, it was agreed by the CLSU PAP-MET and the PCC at 

CLSU Management to relocate the deep well drilling to its directly opposite site which is 

more accessible to the drilling equipment, not to mention that they adopted the 60-meter 

depth requirement based on the original site. 

 

4.44 The member of the PCC Inspectorate Team admitted that they no longer conducted 

follow-up on-site inspections after July 22, 2019, owing to the Contractor’s contention of 

faithful completion of the project. Consequently, the Accountant deferred the processing 

of final payment for the project pending issuance of the Certificate of Final Inspection by 

the PCC Inspectorate Team.  

 

4.45 Simultaneous with the conduct of year-end physical inventory-taking of PPEs, 

validation conducted by the Audit Team on November 17, 2020 revealed that the said Deep 

Well Drilling project was indeed constructed as shown by the following photos taken 

during the time of validation: 

 

                      
                   Deep well structure located at PCC at CLSU National Bull Farm 

 

4.46 Nonetheless, it was noted at the time of validation that the supposed water system 

structure was still not operational since there was not enough water that could be sourced 

out from the deep well as shown in the above photos.  

 

4.47 In the meantime, a small tiny water hose was utilized as waterway of the small 

volume of water coming out from the deep well pump. It was also observed that the water 

coming from said deep well pump has foul smell and was seemingly unfit for general use. 

Subsequently, it was found out that the National Bull Farm relied heavily on its four 

existing small deep wells situated within the vicinity of the farm. These fabricated deep 

wells were being utilized for the following purposes: 

 



72 
 

a. Cleaning of small facilities at the main gate and spraying of vehicles before entering 
the farm premises; 

b. Water supply for not more than two housing units; 
c. Office and laboratory use; and 
d. Cleaning of animal pens 

 

4.48 Aside from the aforesaid fabricated deep wells, the other two sources of water came 

from free-flowing natural well from the mountains situated nearby the vicinity of the 

National Bull Farm. Nevertheless, the Center official concerned averred that the four 

existing small deep wells and the natural wells could hardly sustain the water requirement 

for the whole farm, particularly during summer season wherein some of the deep wells run 

out of water/pond.  

 

4.49 As such, the delayed completion of the water system structure deprived the PCC at 

CLSU of the immediate benefits from the uninterrupted water supply needed for the daily 

operation of the National Bull Farm. 

 

4.50 It is imperative that the water system structure be put in place so as to ensure 

adequate water supply for the daily operation of the farm, particularly in the provision of 

clean water for the buffaloes and for regular cleaning of animal pens. 

 

4.51 In sum, the foregoing deficiencies resulted in the net overstatement of the PPE 

account balance by ₱11,763,587.53, as illustrated below:

4.52 During the Exit Conference, the Accountant committed to immediately prepare the 

necessary adjusting entry in the books of accounts to recognize the completed 

infrastructure project and coordinate with the COA ITSO in the absence of provision for 

depreciation on some PPE items in the e-NGAS. 

 

4.53 Additionally, the Center Director stated that they will schedule a meeting to discuss 

the deep well drilling project and will coordinate with the National Irrigation 

Administration (NIA) Office to bring the matter to a resolution. 

 

4.54 We recommended that the OIC - Executive Director direct the PC Center 

Directors concerned to instruct the respective Accountant/Bookkeeper to (a) provide 

allowance for depreciation on PPE items; (b) derecognize the donated machineries 

and equipment; (c) recognize PPE items erroneously treated as supplies in their 
respective records; (d) draw the necessary journal entry vouchers (JEVs) to correct 

the affected accounts in the books to present fairly in the financial statements; and (e) 

PCC Inspectorate Team  to (i) conduct follow-up inspection of the deep well drilling 

project to determine its status; and (ii) seek consultation with the National Irrigation 

Administration (NIA) Office to explore viable alternative courses of action relative to 

the constructed deep well. 

 

 

Unreliable balance of Biological Assets accounts - ₱122,600.00 

 

5.  The Agency’s non-compliance with the provisions of the Government 

Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, on 

the proper valuation and recognition of breeding stocks and biological assets resulted in 

in the net understatement of Assets and Income by ₱122,600.00 and ₱1,677,000.00, 

respectively, and net understatement of Expenses by ₱1,554,400.00.  



74 
 

5.1 Verification of the operations and accounts of the PCC disclosed the following 

accounting errors and deficiencies; to wit: 

 

a) Understatement of Biological Assets (PCC at CLSU) due to inconsistent application of 

valuation policy - ₱167,150.00   

 

5.2 Chapter 11 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 

Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, provides the standards, policies, procedures and 

guidelines on the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements of 

agricultural activity prescribed under the International Public Sector Accounting Sector 

(IPSAS) 27, Agriculture. Agencies shall apply these policies on biological assets and 

agricultural produce at the point of harvest when they relate to agricultural activity. 

 

5.3 Likewise, Section 7, Chapter 11 of the same Manual states, among others, the 

following related provision: 

 

Sec. 7. Measurement. A biological asset shall be measured on initial 

recognition and at each reporting date at its fair value less costs to sell, 

except where market-determined prices or values are not available, and for 

which alternative estimates of fair value are determined to be clearly 

unreliable. In such a case, that biological asset shall be measured at its cost 

less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. 

(Pars. 16 and 34, PPSAS 27) 

 

5.4 Relatedly, the Program Management Committee (PMC) of the Philippine Carabao 

Center (PCC) approved Resolution No. 01 series of 2018 on March 24, 2018, superseding 

the previous resolutions to adopt revised guidelines for the valuation, acquisition and 

sale/disposal of imported and island born breeding and non-breeding stocks of water 

buffaloes. 

 

5.5 Item 1 of the abovementioned Resolution provides for the determination of fair 

value of buffaloes as tabulated in Appendix B (Schedule of Fair Market Value 

Computation of Buffaloes). 

 

5.6 Meanwhile, verification and re-computation of the amounts reflected in the 

Subsidiary Ledger (SL) for the Breeding Stocks and Livestock Held for 

Consumption/Sale/Distribution accounts and the Report on the Physical Count of Property, 

Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) disclosed discrepancies in the valuation of some animals 

as detailed in Appendix E, and summarized in the table below:

RPCPPE

Total ₱317,100.00 ₱484,250.00 ₱167,150.00 

 



75 
 

5.7 Such inconsistent application of the valuation policy understated the Biological 

Assets account by ₱167,150.00 as at year-end. 

 

b) Non-recognition of calves produced and animals acquired-₱1,509,850.00 
 

5.8 As prescribed under Section 6, Chapter 11 of the same Manual, an entity shall 

recognize a biological asset or agricultural produce when and only when: 

 

a. The entity controls the asset as a result of past events; 

b. It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential 

associated with the asset will flow to the entity; and 

c. The fair value or cost of the asset can be measured reliably. (Par. 13, 

PPSAS 27) 

 

5.9 Likewise, Section 12, Chapter 11 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides the 

illustrative accounting entries in the recognition of newborn breeding stocks. 

 

5.10 The Audit Team assigned at the said PC Center witnessed the year-end physical 

inventory-taking of buffaloes on November 10, 2020 and November 17, 2020 at the PCC-

CLSU Dairy Farm and PCC National Bull Farm, respectively. It was observed that the 

animals were kept in the pen and provided with individual ear tag number for easy 

identification. 

 

5.11 However, review of the Calf Production Report and various Property Transfer 

Reports (PTRs) covering the year 2020 showed that some heads of crossbred calves and 

male buffaloes received from the PCC National Headquarters and Gene Pool (NHGP) were 

neither reported in the Breeding Stocks Schedule nor in the RPCPPE of the Accounting 

and Property Units, respectively, as shown in the table hereunder:

2GP17016 Bulgarian Murrah Buffalo-Male 22,750.00 

Sub-total  45,500.00 

Total   ₱66,750.00 

 

5.12 The non-recognition of the aforesaid animals resulted in the understatement of the 

Breeding Stocks account by ₱66,750.00 as at year-end. 

 

5.13 During Exit Conference, the Property Officer of PCC at CLSU explained that their 

basis of non-recognition of calves was due to the higher incidence of mortality among 



76 
 

calves particularly those that are below six-month old that is why they only recognized 

those calves born until June 30, 2020. 

 

5.14 The Audit Team respected the explanation of the Property Officer, however, the 

fact remained that the non-recognition affected the assertion on the fair presentation of the 

financial statements. 

5.15 Similarly, the Audit Team of PCC at VSU reported that the said PC Center did not 

recognize in the books of accounts the 31 heads of calves born during CY 2020 valued at 

₱155,000.00 resulting in the understatement of Breeding Stocks account by the same 

amount. 

 

5.16 The Audit Team’s verification of the Report of Physical Count of Property Plant 

and Equipment (RPCPPE)- Livestock Held for Consumption/Sale/Distribution showed 

that calves born during CY 2020 were not included thereat nor recorded in the books of 

accounts for the same period.  The Calving Report provided by the personnel in-charge 

reported the following births for the period; to wit:

5.17 During the interview with the personnel in-charge, the Audit Team was informed 

that the new-born calves were covered by the Dairy Buffalo Multiplier Farm (DBMF) 

Contract. As such, PCC at VSU waits for the DBMF Operator to exercise the option to buy 

the calves produced before recording the same.   In turn, these new calves have remained 

as unrecorded assets, and unaccounted for until the DBMF would decide on which option 

to exercise. 

 

5.18 On the other hand, the contract between the PCC at VSU and the DBMF Operator 

states that the buffaloes are loaned to the operators so that it is the PCC who still retains 

ownership and control over the biological asset, and consequently over its offspring.  It is 

clearly stated in Article 5 of the contract that full ownership is not given to the DBMF 

Operator such that the PCC at VSU reserves the right to repossess, at any time and without 

compensation, the dairy animals originally provided by PCC at VSU, including its 

offspring. 

 

5.19 As defined in the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, Assets are resources controlled by 

an entity as a result of past events, and from which future economic benefits or service 

potential are expected to flow to the entity.    Further,  Section 31 of PPSAS 27 provides 

that a gain may arise on initial recognition of a biological asset, such as when a calf is born. 

It stands to reason, therefore, that the PC Center retains control over  the offspring of the 

dairy animals,   and to protect the interests of the government, the Agency should recognize 

the new born calves as assets in order to properly  monitor the accountability over these 

biological assets.  In recognizing these assets under their proper classification, there is an 

assurance that the asset accounts of the Agency are accurately and fairly presented. 

 

5.20 The non-recording of these newborn calves resulted in the understatement of the 

Biological Assets account by ₱155,000.00. 

 
5.21 In the same way, review of records of the Philippine Carabao Center at Don 

Mariano Marcos Memorial State University (PCC at DMMMSU) disclosed that at least 74 

calves were produced under the PAIWI system in CY 2020. The said calves had a total fair 

value of ₱361,000.00 based on the pricing guidelines adopted by the said PC Center. 

Considering that the PC Center was entitled to 50% share, it should have recorded at least  

a sum of ₱180,500.00 under the Gain on Initial Recognition of Biological Assets and 

Breeding Stocks accounts. (Refer to Appendix F.) 



78 
 

5.22 Moreover, the unrecorded 105 calves in CYs 2018 and 2019 which were the subject 

of AOM No. 2020-005 dated February 20, 2020, remained unimplemented as at the end of 

the year. In addition, these calves should have been revalued to ₱1,107,600.00 as at 

December 31, 2020 for the increase in fair value due to physical change based on the fair 

value computation tables shown in Appendix B (Schedule of Fair Market Value 

Computation of Buffaloes).  

 

5.23 The unrecorded calves in 2018 up to 2020 totaled to 179 valued at ₱1,288,100.00, 

broken down as follows: 

 

Year No. of Calves 
Fair Value Less Estimated Cost to Sell 

as of December 2020 

2018 61   ₱    674,375.00 

2019 44 433,225.00 

2020 74 180,500.00 

TOTAL 179  ₱ 1,288,100.00 

 

5.24 The continued non-recognition of the PCC at DMMMSU share in the calves born 

under the PAIWI system and gains from changes in fair value due to physical change 

resulted in the understatement of the accounts Breeding Stocks by at least ₱1,288,100.00, 

Gain on Initial Recognition of Biological Assets by ₱180,500.00 and Gains from Changes 

in Fair Value less Cost to Sell due to Physical Change by ₱1,107,600.00,  in addition to 

undetermined amounts pertaining to those born in prior years where gain from initial 

recognition was likewise not recorded.   

 

5.25 The Management explained that the non-recognition of PCC at VSUs share from 

the calves was due to absence of basis of recording. 

 

5.26 The afore-cited lapses also contravened Section 9, Chapter 11 of GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I, which provides that “A gain or loss arising on initial recognition of a biological 

asset at fair value less cost to sell and from a change in fair value less costs to sell of a 

biological asset shall be included in surplus or deficit for the period in which it arises.”  

 

c) Inclusion of dead animals in the books of accounts and inventory reports under the 
Livestock Held for Consumption/Sale/Distribution account (PCC at VSU)- ₱1,554,400.00 

 

5.27 Review of the Schedule of Biological Asset-Livestock Held for 

Consumption/Sale/Distribution account by the Audit Team of PCC at VSU showed 36 

dead carabaos amounting to ₱1,544,400.00 were still carried in the books as at year-end, 

summary of which are shown in Appendix G. 

  

5.28 The Bookkeeper explained that derecognition of those dead carabaos from the 

books could not be effected considering that the Property and Supply Office (PSO) has not 

yet submitted the necessary supporting papers as of year-end. However, the Audit Team’s 

records showed that no request for relief from property accountability was filed by the 

Management relative to the death of those animals. 

 



79 
 

5.29 The non-derecognition of the equivalent value of the dead animals from the 

biological assets account of the PCC at VSU overstated the year-end Biological Assets 

account balance by ₱1,554,400.00. 

 

5.30 In summary, the above non-compliance, errors, and deficiencies committed by the 

PCC Management resulted in the net understatement of Assets and Income by ₱122,600.00 

and ₱1,677,000.00, respectively, and net understatement of Expenses by ₱1,554,400.00,

5.31  We recommended that the Executive Director instruct the respective Center

policy established by the PCC on Biological Assets; (b) recognize the calves produced 

and animals acquired in their respective records; (c) draw the necessary journal entry

dead animals in the books of accounts.   

 

 

Doubtful accuracy and validity of Financial Liabilities – ₱3,959,241.47 (net) 

 

6.  The accuracy and validity of some items reported under Financial Liabilities 

accounts were uncertain due to (a) unsubstantiated recognition of payables amounting 

to ₱5,088,349.39; (b) unrecognized liabilities for delivered/accepted supplies and 

materials worth ₱305,394.26; and (c) unsupported adjustments reducing Accounts 

Payable by ₱823,713.66.  In sum, Financial Liabilities was overstated by a net amount 

of ₱3,959,241.47   
 

(a) Unsubstantiated recognition of payables (PCC at DMMMSU)- ₱5,088,349.39 
 

6.1 Section 37 of Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 

National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, provides that: 
 

No obligation shall be certified to accounts payable unless the obligation is 

founded on a valid claim that is properly supported by sufficient evidence and 

unless there is proper authority for its incurrence. Any certification for a non-

existent or fictitious obligation and/or creditor shall be considered void. The 

certifying official shall be dismissed from the service, without prejudice to 

criminal prosecution under the provisions of the Revised Penal Code. Any 

payment made under such certification shall be illegal and every official 

authorizing or making such payment, or taking part therein or receiving such 

payment, shall be jointly and severally liable to the government for the full 

amount so paid or received. 

 

6.2 Relatively, Section 2 of Chapter 6 of the same Manual refers to Accounts Payable 

as valid and legal obligations of NGAs/OUs, for which, goods/services/projects have been 

delivered/rendered/ completed and accepted, regardless of the year when these obligations 

were incurred. 

 

6.3 The Financial Statements of the Philippine Carabao Center at Don Mariano Marcos 

Memorial State University (PCC at DMMMSU) as at December 31, 2020 reported a 

balance of ₱5,303,749.24. Validation of the Audit Team assigned thereat, however, 

revealed that claims totaling to ₱5,088,349.39 or 96% of the balance were not supported 

with complete and proper documentation. 

 

6.4 The Audit Team requested for copies of documents to support the recorded claims; 

however, the Bookkeeper furnished the Schedule of Accounts Payable wherein creditors 

were listed with their corresponding total claims. Some Purchase Orders (P.O.s) were 

provided, but were not supported with Purchase Requests, Campus Bids and Awards 

Committee Resolution for the mode of procurement, Requests for Quotation, and Abstract 

of Quotations. Other deficiencies noted are absence of Purchase Orders/Job 



81 
 

Orders/Contracts, Delivery Receipts, Inspection and Acceptance Reports and unsigned 

Purchase Orders by suppliers. 

 

6.5 The absence of complete and proper supporting documents prevented the Audit 

Team from ascertaining the validity of the recorded Accounts Payable. 

 

6.6 The following accounts were debited when the payables/liabilities were set up: 

 
Account Amount 

Other Structures ₱1,110,000.00 

Other Machineries 1,139,390.00 

Semi-Expendable Office Equipment 381,900.00 

Various Expenses 2,457,059.39 

Total ₱5,088,349.39 

 

6.7 As a result, the validity of the balances of the Other Structures, Other Machineries 

and Equipment and Accumulated Surplus accounts, as shown above, was also doubtful due 

to the aforementioned reasons. 

 

6.8  The Audit Team also observed that an adjustment amounting to ₱335,000.00 was 

made to Accounts Payable in June 2020, representing reversion of payables due to an 

invalid claim. 

 

6.9 Management was reminded that Accounts Payable should be recorded based on 

valid claims with sufficient and complete documentation. As such, the supporting 

documents must be complete and made available when required. 

 

(b) Unrecognized liabilities for delivered/accepted supplies and materials (PCC at 
VSU)-₱305,394.26 

 

6.10 The Audit Team’s verification assigned in the Center disclosed that goods and 

services already delivered and accepted during the year 2020 aggregating to ₱305,394.26  

remained unrecognized as payables, as detailed below:

6.11 The Property Custodian confirmed the receipt of the aforementioned deliveries as 

evidenced by the related Inspection and Acceptance Reports (IAR); however, the 



82 
 

Bookkeeper clarified that no payables were recognized due to non-submission of pertinent 

documents as bases of recognition of payables to respective payees. 

 

6.12 GAM, Volume III prescribes the use of Accounts Payable account to recognize 

receipt of goods and services on account in the normal course of trade and business 

operation. 

 

6.13 It is understood that the recognition of payables shall be supported with valid 

supporting documents. In view of that, the personnel concerned is required to submit the 

same to the Bookkeeper for recording. The non-recognition of a valid claim will most likely 

result to the misstatement of Accounts Payable contrary to International Public Sector 

Accounting Standards (IPSAS) I on Presentation of Financial Statements (FS), quoted as 

follows: 

 

Financial Statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial 

performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the 

faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and 

conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for 

assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in International Public Sector 

Accounting Standards (IPSAS). The application of IPSAs, with additional 

disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that 

achieve a fair presentation. 

 

(c) Unsupported adjustments to Accounts Payable (PCC at VSU)- ₱ 823,713.66 
 

6.14 The Audit Team of PCC at VSU reiterated its audit observation pertaining to 

unsupported adjustments effected by the Bookkeeper; to wit: 

 
Reference No. and Date Account  Debit  Credit 

JEV-2019-12-000768 dated

Adjustment of recording the Accounts   Payable instead of Other Payables due to deduction from C N A 

of PCCEA 

Total ₱ 823,713.66 ₱ 823,713.66 

 

6.15 The Bookkeeper explained that the amount adjusted under JEV-2019-12-000768 

and JEV-2019-12-000769 represents the Accounts Payable of prior years.  The same 

Bookkeeper further admitted that due to difficulty in tracing the details of each payable, 

she decided to close the account and start anew for CY 2019 transactions.  For JEV-2019-

12-000781, an adjustment was made to reflect the changes in the deduction made from 

employees; nevertheless, there were no computations or details to support the JEV. 

 



83 
 

6.16 Be as it may, the noted unsupported adjustments contributed to the doubtful 

accuracy, validity and existence of the account balance as of year-end, thus, affecting the 

fair presentation of the financial statements. 

 

6.17 We recommended that the Executive Director instruct the Accountant 

concerned to (a) submit to the Audit Team the documents to support the recognition 

of payables as at year-end for verification; (b) record as payables those obligations 

which have become due and demandable based on complete documentary 

requirements to warrant the validity and legality thereof; and (c) henceforth, ensure 

the submission of the required Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) and supporting 

documents to substantiate the adjusting/correcting entries made on Accounts 

Payable. 

 

 

Unexpended balances of Due to National Government Agencies (NGAs) - ₱5.81 Million 

 

7.  Unexpended fund balances of the completed projects totaling to ₱5,814,954.74 

were not remitted to the Source Agencies (SAs) contrary to Section 63(g), Chapter 6 of 

the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies 

(NGAs), Volume I, and the related Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) entered by and 

between the Philippine Carabao Center (PCC) and the Source Agencies (SAs). 

 

7.1 Section 63(g), Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 

National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, states that the Implementing Agency 

(IA) shall return to the Source Agency (SA) any unused balance upon completion of the 

project, if stipulated in the MOA. 

 

7.2 All funds transferred by various NGAs were based on a duly executed 

Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) entered into by and between the NGA as source 

agency (SA) and the PCC NHGP as the implementing agency (IA). The MOA states that 

any unexpended balance after the completion of the project shall be returned by the PCC 

NHGP to the SAs. 

 

7.3 In the prior years and for CY 2020, the PCC National Headquarters and Gene Pool 

(NHGP) had been a recipient of funds transferred by various National Government 

Agencies (NGAs) for the implementation of several projects, majority of which were 

focused on Research and Development (R&D) and extension activities. 

 

7.4 Each project was duly recognized in the books of accounts with separate subsidiary 

ledger (SL) to facilitate proper monitoring of the receipt and liquidation of project funds. 

The agreement of the balances per SL with the Due to NGAs controlling account was also 

established as at year-end. 

 

7.5 As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of the Due to NGAs account 

aggregated to ₱129,388,745.45, representing a total of 55 projects with outstanding 

subsidiary ledger (SL) balances (Appendix H). 



84 
 

7.6 However, review of the different MOA and other pertinent records disclosed that 

the outstanding balance of 16 projects totaling to ₱5,814,954.74 should have already been 

liquidated since the period of their project implementation had already lapsed, as 

summarized in the following aging schedule and as detailed in Appendix I of this Report:

7.7 Analysis of the past due accounts showed that most projects have outstanding fund 

balances as of year-end which could be attributed to unexpended funds on some line-item 

expenditures in the budget and savings realized from the procurement of some supplies and 

materials in the course of project implementation. 

 

7.8 Interview with the Accountant disclosed that they have yet to reconcile and update 

their records to be able to submit the required liquidation reports. Likewise, some of the 

Project Leaders and Staffs admitted that the Terminal Reports and other project documents 

for submission to SAs are still in the stage of finalization. 

 

7.9  The continued practice of keeping excess funds after the purposes for which have 

been accomplished is inconsistent with Section 63(g) of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.  

Moreover, the continuous failure to return unused funds to the SAs deprived the latter of 

additional funds to finance other related PPAs or provide assistance to other agencies in 

need. 

 

7.10 We recommended and the Executive Director agreed to instruct the 

Administrative and Financial Management Division (PCC-NHGP) to (a) strictly 

comply with Section 63 (g) of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I and the terms and 

conditions of the MOA; (b) expedite the (i) updating of records to facilitate the 

preparation of liquidation reports; (ii) perform reconciliation of the Budget and 

Accounting records; and (iii) immediately remit unexpended fund balances of 

completed projects to Source Agencies (SAs). 
 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

8.  Lapses in the GAD planning, budgeting and reporting of programs, activities and 

projects (PAPs) were noted in CY 2020, such as (a) non-reconstitution of the existing 



85 
 

GAD Focal Point System (GFPS); and (b) failure to use the Harmonized Gender and 

Development Guidelines (HGDG) tools in the preparation of GAD Plan and Budget 

(GPB) and GAD Accomplishment Report (GAD AR), inconsistent with Section 5 of the 

Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) Memorandum Circular No. 2011-01 dated 

October 21, 2011 and Paragraph 3.4 of Philippine Commission on Women-National 

Economic and Development Authority-Department of Budget and Management (PCW-

NEDA-DBM) Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01.  

 

8.1  Pursuant to the Magna Carta of Women (MCW) and Section 31 of the General 

Provisions for the General Appropriations Act of the Fiscal Year 2020, all government 

agencies shall formulate their annual GAD Plan and Budgets (GPBs) within the context of 

their mandates to mainstream gender perspectives in their policies, programs and projects 

(PAPs). GAD planning shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, the cost 

of implementation of which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their total budgets. 

(emphasis supplied)   

 

8.2 Review of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for FY 2020 as endorsed by 

the PCW showed a total GAD budget of ₱43,210,000.00 which was 7.23% of total 

Agency’s appropriation of ₱597,383,000.00, thus, compliant with the abovementioned 

requirement of at least five percent (5%) of the total agency budget. 

 

2.20. Furthermore, audit of compliance by the PCC NHGP with the existing rules and 
regulations on GAD disclosed the following deficiencies: 

 

(a) Non-reconstitution of the existing GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) 
 

8.3 Section 2.2 of the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) Memorandum 

Circular No. 2011-01 dated October 21, 2011 provides the policy guidelines for the 

creation, strengthening, and institutionalization of the Gender and Development Focal 

Point System (GFPS) as follows: 

 

2.2 Section 37-C of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the 

Magna Carta of Women (MCW) provides that all concerned government 

agencies and instrumentalities mentioned above shall establish or strengthen 

their GFPS or a similar GAD mechanism to catalyze and accelerate gender 

mainstreaming within the agency. 

 

8.4 Likewise, Section 5.1 of the same PCW Memorandum Circular partly states that                  

the GFPS shall be composed of the Agency Head and Executive Committee (ExeCom), and 

a Technical Working Group (TWG). The head of agency may designate an Undersecretary 

or its equivalent to head the GFPS Executive Committee. 

 

8.5 The following figure illustrates the GFPS structure as prescribed by the PCW: 
 



86 
 

 
 

8.6 The existing structure of the Agency’s GFPS was reconstituted on May 31, 2017 

by way of Special Order (SO) No. 84, series of 2017, as approved by the Executive Director 

III and composed of the following committees and groups: 

 

 Undersecretary/GFPS ExeCom; 

 Three members of the GFPS ExeCom; 

 Lead, TWG; and 

 16 TWG members composed of representatives from National Headquarters 
and Gene Pool (NHGP) and 12 PCC Regional Centers 

 

8.7 The issued SO likewise enumerated the roles and responsibilities of the GFPS 

ExeCom and the TWG. However, it was observed that the Head of Agency (HOA) was not 

included in the whole GFPS Structure which was not harmonized with Section 5.1 of the 

PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2011-01 dated October 21, 2011 which states that the 

HOA shall be responsible for issuing policies or other directives that support GAD and for 

approval of the GPB of the Agency. 

 

8.8 In addition, verification with the personnel concerned from the GFPS disclosed that 

the designated Undersecretary who also acted as the Lead of the GFPS Executive 

Committee filed a study leave on September 2020. For this reason, a Special Order No. 

158 series of 2020 was issued on September 30, 2020 by the Executive Director III 

designating a new Head of the PCC GAD Technical Working Group (TWG). 

 

8.9 Out of the three members of the GFPS ExeCom, only one member remained active 

in service as the other one retired from the service in January 2020 while another member 

was transferred to another government agency in June 2020. Thereafter, no other directive 

was issued to replace the said members of the GFPS ExeCom. 

 

8.10 Due to the non-reconstitution of the existing structure and composition of the 

GFPS, the mechanism put in place for catalyzing and accelerating gender mainstreaming 

in the Agency may not fully function as prescribed under the aforementioned PCW 

Memorandum Circular. 

 



87 
 

(b) The HGDG tools were not used in the preparation of GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) 
and GAD Accomplishment Report (AR). 

 

8.11 Paragraph 3.4 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 partly states 

that to aid gender mainstreaming, agencies shall perform gender analysis using existing 

tools, such as the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG), to ensure 

that the different concerns of women and men are addressed equally and equitably in their 

PAPs. Activities to address these different concerns through capacity development on GAD 

or GAD-focused activities shall be included in the agency GPBs. 

 

8.12 It is worthy to mention that the PCW issued Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 

dated January 20, 2021 provides the guidelines for the submission of FY 2020 GAD 

Accomplishment Report (AR). Section 3.0 thereof identified PCC as one of the pilot 

agencies to prepare its FY 2020 GAD AR using the revised GAD AR form and submit the 

same through the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) Version 3. It also 

indicated the deadline of encoding and submission to PCW of FY 2020 GAD AR of the 

PCC which was on March 12, 2021. Accordingly, the PCC submitted its FY 2020 GAD 

AR on March 18, 2021 pending review and endorsement by the PCW. 

 

8.13 Meanwhile, comparison of the GPB and the submitted GAD AR for FY 2020 

showed 15 actual GAD activities conducted under the Client-Focused section, eight 

activities under the Organization-Focused section and one activity reported under the 

GAD-Attributed Programs or Projects, with details as shown in Appendix J of this 

Memorandum. Total expenditures attributed to GAD amounted to ₱35,750,138.55, posting 

82.74% utilization of the GAD Budget of ₱43,210,000.00. 

 

8.14 Interview with the Budget Officer disclosed that the ₱110,000,000.00 budget as 

reported under the GAD-attributed programs or projects was originally part of the Regular 

Agency Fund of the PCC for FY 2020. The said budget was intended for the project 

“Establishment of Province-Wide Carabao-Based Business Improvement Network”. 

However, owing to the delayed compliance with some project requirements by the DBM 

prior to the releasing of the said fund, the Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) was 

only issued by the DBM on March 4, 2021. Although no amount of expenditure was 

reported in the GAD AR for the project, the Budget Officer averred that there were initial 

activities conducted during FY 2020 related to the project. 

 

8.15 Moreover, the Audit Team learned that the GFPS has not conducted a gender audit 

or gender analysis in accordance with the instructions in using the HGDG tools. It was 

noted that the total budget of ₱110,000,000.00 was reported under the GAD-attributed 

programs or projects. However, the same was not subjected to the HGDG assessment 

which requires the project implementers concerned to accomplish Box 8 or the GAD 

Checklist for designing and evaluating agricultural and agrarian reform projects. 

 

8.16 As such, the GFPS was not able to generate sex-disaggregated data which should 

have been the basis in performance-based gender responsive planning and in identifying 

gender issues. These lapses were contrary to the general guidelines and essential elements 



88 
 

in GAD planning and budgeting as partly quoted under Paragraph 3.4 of the PCW-NEDA-

DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01. 

 

8.17 The designated Head of the GAD TWG who also acted as the GAD Focal Person 

admitted that they did not use the HGDG tool during the GAD planning, budgeting and 

reporting because they were not yet knowledgeable on the use of the said tool. 

 

8.18 The lack of gender audit and sex-disaggregated data may undermine the generation 

of a more reliable/comprehensive inputs or bases in the gender mainstreaming towards the 

promotion of gender equality and women empowerment. 

 

8.19 We recommended that the OIC-Executive Director instruct the GAD officers 

concerned to (a) reconstitute the structure and composition of the Agency’s GFPS to 

conform with the PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2011-01 dated October 21, 2011; 

(b) enhance their knowledge on the attribution of the costs of GAD-related 

accomplishments through trainings and similar interventions; (c) use the 

Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) assessment tool in the 

attribution of programs, activities and projects; and (d) furnish the Audit Team with 

a copy of the PCW-endorsed GAD Accomplishment Report after approval by the 

Agency Head. 

 

 

Procurement of Carabao’s Milk under the Department of Education Milk Feeding 

Program - ₱16.1 million 

 

9.  The procurement of ₱16,100,200.00 worth of fresh carabao’s milk sourced from 

the local dairy farmers and cooperatives was successfully undertaken by the Philippine 

Carabao Center-National Headquarters Gene Pool (PCC NHGP) during calendar year 

2020, benefitting 90,020 undernourished children enrolled under the DepEd Milk 

Feeding Program. Nonetheless, deficiencies and flaws were noted in the contract 

preparation and implementation phases, thus, contrary to relevant laws, rules and 

regulations.   

 

9.1 Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11037, otherwise known as the “Masustansyang Pagkain 

Para sa Batang Pilipino Act”, mandates the Department of Education (DepEd) and the 

Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) to implement the School-Based 

Feeding Program (SBFP) and Supplementary Feeding Program (SFP), respectively, to 

address undernutrition among Filipino children. 

 

9.2 Milk Feeding, as one of the components of the National Feeding Program, is 

implemented in coordination with the Philippine Carabao Center (PCC) and the National 

Dairy Authority (NDA). Under R.A. No. 11037, the milk to be utilized and procured for 

the Milk Feeding Program must be locally produced to help boost the livelihood 

opportunities of the local dairy farmers and the local dairy industry. 

 



89 
 

9.3 Based on the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) entered into by and between the 

different Schools Division Offices (SDOs) of the DepEd and the PCC, funds for the Milk 

Feeding Program will be transferred to PCC to facilitate the procurement of milk from 

PCC-assisted dairy cooperatives and farmers. In such manner, the milk requirements of the 

undernourished children enrolled in DepEd were supplied by the local dairy farmers and 

cooperatives. 

 

9.4 By virtue of Memorandum Order No. 00-149-2020 dated October 19, 2020 issued 

by the OIC-Executive Director at that time, the recommended mode of procurement for the 

DepEd and DSWD Milk Feeding Program is Emergency Procurement under R.A.  No. 

11494 or the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act and subject to Section 6 of the Government 

Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Circular No. 01-2020 on the Guidelines for Emergency 

Procurement wherein Procuring Entities (PEs) are encouraged to directly purchase 

agricultural products from local farmers or farmers’ associations or cooperatives. 

 

9.5 Accordingly, a certification was issued by the OIC-Executive Director stating that 

the Philippine Carabao Center-National Headquarters Gene Pool (PCC NHGP) exerted 

diligent effort to secure the most advantageous price to the government based on existing 

price data of the Agency, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) or other relevant 

agencies or preliminary market scanning. Salient provisions of the said Certification state 

the following price data: 

 

Based on market survey and inquiry from various processors/suppliers of 

carabao’s milk has a prevailing market price of ₱18.00 to ₱35.00 per 200 ml 

pack. For this Milk Feeding Program, the Agency Budget Price (ABC) for 

the pasteurized toned carabao’s milk is ₱18.00 to ₱20.00 per sachet/pack. 

 

9.6 The Physical Accomplishment Report as of December 31, 2020 as submitted by 

the PCC National Coordinator for the Milk Feeding Program showed the following data: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



90 
 

9.7 Out of the total targeted program beneficiaries of 179,832, a considerable number 

totaling to 90,020 were fed for the period of eight to 20 days in CY 2020 while the 

remaining 89,812 beneficiaries were provided milk during the months of January and 

February 2021. 

 

9.8 As to the financial accomplishment of the Program, a total amount of 

₱67,496,336.80 was transferred by different SDOs to PCC as at December 31, 2020, of 

which ₱16,163,875.27 was actually paid during the year while the remaining 

₱51,332,461.53 was obligated as at year-end, thus, registering a 100% utilization rate of 

the funds available (see Appendix K for the details). 

 

9.9 Meanwhile, vouching of the disbursement vouchers (DVs) relative to the 

procurement of fresh carabao’s milk worth ₱16,100,200.00 (Appendix L) disclosed the 

following flaws and shortcomings: 

 

(a) Incomplete documentation during contract implementation contrary to the 
Contract Agreement entered by and between the PCC NHGP and the dairy cooperatives 

 

9.10 During CY 2020, the PCC NHGP entered into a Contract Agreement with different 

local dairy farmers and cooperatives located all over Luzon. The Scope of Works in the 

Contract Agreement provided for the standards and specifications in the supply, delivery, 

inspection and acceptance of milk. 

 

9.11 However, it was noted that the following requisite documents were not attached to 

the DVs: 

 

 Certificate of Analysis (CoA) for pasteurized milk samples (3), in compliance with 
standards of at least 1.5% fat, 9.5% solid non-fat (SNF) and Food and Drugs 

Administration (FDA) microbiological quality for pasteurized milk; 

 

 Valid FDA-License to Operate (LTO) as food manufacturer or Sanitary Permit 
from LGU where the processing plant is located; and 

 

 Certification that milk delivered are acceptable and of good quality condition. 
 

9.12 Although there were certifications executed by the officials concerned of the PCC 

NHGP and the PCC at University of the Philippines- Los Baños (UPLB) that the dairy 

cooperatives had satisfactorily completed and delivered the milk requirements, absence of 

the aforementioned documents was not simply a violation of the related provisions of the 

Contract Agreement but may denote uncertainty as to conformance to set quality standards 

of the milk delivered. 

 

(b) Non-compliance with the prescribed period of contract execution and issuance of 
Notice of Award and Notice to Proceed  

 



91 
 

9.13 Sections 37.2.1 and 37.4.1 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations 

(RIRR) of R.A. No. 9184 pronounces, among others, the following related provisions: 

 

37.2.1 The winning bidder shall enter into contract with the Procuring Entity 

within ten (10) calendar days from receipt by the winning bidder of the Notice 

of Award (NoA).  

 

37.4.1. The concerned Procuring Entity shall issue the Notice to Proceed 

(NTP) together with a copy or copies of the approved contract to the 

successful bidder within seven (7) calendar days from the date of approval of 

the contract by the appropriate government approving authority. 

 

9.14 However, it was noted during the review of contract agreements that some were 

executed at a date earlier than the acceptance of Notice of Award (NoA) by the winning 

supplier. There were also instances wherein the Notice to Proceed (NTP) was received by 

the winning supplier ahead of the contract execution. 

 

9.15 Non-conformance with the period of execution or issuance of procurement 

documents may compromise the relevance and timeliness of the project, particularly to the 

intended end-users/beneficiaries. 

 

(c) The requisite procurement documents were not published in the agency’s website 
and at any conspicuous place within seven (7) working days from the date of acceptance 

of the award. 

 

9.16 Section 4(u) of R.A. No. 11494 or the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act which 

took effect on September 15, 2020 requires the following information and documents 

relative to the procurement to be published in the GPPB online portal, the website of the 

procuring entity concerned, if available, and at any conspicuous place reserved for the 

purpose in the premises of the procuring entity within seven (7) working days from the 

date of acceptance of the award: 

 

(i) Project name; 
(ii) Approved budget for contract; 
(iii)  Contract period 
(iv)  Name of winning supplier, distributor, manufacturer, contractor or 

consultant; 

(v)  Amount of contract as awarded; 
(vi)  Notice of Award; 
(vii) Date of award and acceptance; 
(viii) Contract or purchase order; and 
(ix) A certification stating that the procuring entity exerted all efforts to 

secure the most advantageous price to the government based on existing 

price data of the agency, the DTI or other relevant agencies or 

preliminary scanning done by the agency showing prevailing market 

prices and practice.  



92 
 

9.17 While it is worthy to mention that the Agency published the aforementioned 

information and documents in the GPPB online portal, no publication was neither made in 

the agency’s website nor at any conspicuous place in the agency’s premises within a period 

of seven (7) working days from the date of the award; thus, the practice was not in harmony 

with the principle of transparency in government procurement processes. 

 

9.18 Interview with one of the Procurement staff disclosed that they were not aware of 

the additional requirement to publish the procurement documents in the agency’s website 

and at the Agency’s procurement bulletin board. They committed, however, to comply 

thereto in the Agency’s existing and future procurement activities relative to the 

Emergency Procurement of pasteurized milk under the Milk Feeding Program. 

 

9.19 We commended the management of PCC NHGP and PCC at UPLB for the 

smooth implementation of the Milk Feeding Program in its first year of operation, 

and recommended that the Executive Director instruct the BAC and other officials 

and employees concerned to  (a) ensure complete documentation of the transactions 

in compliance with the Contract Agreement; (b) strictly comply with the prescribed 

period of contract execution or the issuance of Notice of Award and Notice to Proceed; 

and (c) see to it that the publication of the necessary information and procurement 

documents relative to the Milk Feeding Program is carried out in all required avenues 

within seven working days from the date of acceptance of the award. 

 

 

Implementation of Modified “Paiwi” - Cooperative Dairy Module (CDM) in the Province 

of Nueva Ecija and the operations of the National Gene Pool (NGP) of PCC NHGP 

 

10.  The Modified “Paiwi” or Trusteeship Scheme of the Dairy Buffalo Module 

Program (DMBP) of the Philippine Carabao Center (PCC) has substantially attained its 

objective of providing additional income to the farmer-beneficiaries for the last two years 

covering CYs 2018 to 2019, realized from the milk produced and calves born, with a total 

amount of ₱200,029,594.16. However, for the same period, 102 instances of deaths and 

167 cases of culling of buffaloes occurred due to health issues, thus, hindering the 

efficient implementation and attainment of optimum program results. Similarly, 

measures undertaken to mitigate the loss of buffaloes thru death at the NGP Center were 

fairly effective as manifested by the (a) decrease in mortality of three heads; (b) the 

decline in the number of deaths caused by ruminal tympany/bloat from nine to two heads 

during the year 2020; and (c) culling of animals with poor body condition dropped from 

23 heads to four. The mortalities and culling of animals, regardless of cause, still posed 

a threat to the preservation of the animals that would otherwise contribute to the 

sustainability of the Agency’s Genetic Improvement Program. 
 

10.1 The Philippine Carabao Center (PCC) is one of the attached agencies of the 

Department of Agriculture (DA), created by virtue of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7307, 

otherwise known as the Philippine Carabao Act of 1992. The PCC was established to 

institutionalize the Carabao Development Program (CDP) of the government. Specifically, 

the PCC was operationalized on April 1, 1993 to conserve, propagate, and promote the 



93 
 

carabao as a source of draft animal power, meat, milk, and hide for the benefit of rural 

farmers, particularly the smallholder-farmers and the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform 

Program (CARP) beneficiaries through carabao genetic improvement, technology 

development and dissemination, and establishment of carabao-based enterprises, thus, 

ensuring higher income and better nutrition of rural farming communities. 

 

10.2 PCC mandates are being implemented through three major programs; (a) Genetic 

Improvement; (b) Research and Development; and (c) Social and Enterprise Development. 

 

10.3 Under the Genetic Improvement Program (GIP), PCC’s effort to conserve existing 

local germplasm are complemented with the judicious introduction of riverine buffalo 

germplasm into pre-identified population of swamp buffalo. This is intended to improve 

the genetic potentials for milk and meat production, thus, maximizing benefits from this 

specie to meet immediate and medium-term requirements of the rural poor and growing 

human population. 

 

10.4 In the implementation of the GIP, gene pools were established classified into two: 

1) Gene Pool for Swamp Buffalo; and 2) Gene Pool for Riverine Buffalo. 

 

10.5 The National Gene Pool (NGP) maintained by the PCC serves as the 

nucleus/breeder farm where genetically superior animals will be sourced out. 

 

10.6 The Gene Pool for indigenous Philippine Swamp buffalo is at PCC Cagayan State 

University with its farm in Piat, Cagayan while an open nucleus herd of elite riverine breed 

of buffalos (Murrah-based) for milk production is at the National Gene Pool (NGP) located 

in the PCC National Headquarters and Gene Pool (PCC NHGP), Science City of Munoz, 

Nueva Ecija. 

 

10.7 Purebred riverine buffaloes are also maintained at the farmer’s holdings via the 

Dairy Buffalo Modules (DBM) and their performance are continuously recorded, gathered, 

and evaluated. Top performing female animals are either brought to the nucleus herd or 

retained in the farmers’ care to serve as dams of future sires. 

 

10.8 Meanwhile, Social and Enterprise Development Program component of the CDP is 

designed to address the ever-growing need for poverty alleviation, nutritional 

improvement, and farmer’s empowerment by showcasing buffalo-based livelihood 

opportunities. The Program supports the establishment of community organizations and 

cooperatives among farmers in target communities to grow into independent and potent 

avenues in promoting Carabao-based enterprises. 

 

10.9 Social and Enterprise Development Program (SEDP) is commonly known as 

Carabao-Based Development (CBED) Program. CBED program was conceived by PCC 

as one of the major springboards in the development of local dairy industry using the 

carabao as economic resource of smallholder farmers.

Modified Paiwi-Cooperative Dairy Module (CDM) 

 

10.10 The “Modified Paiwi” is a scheme wherein the trustee is expected to take care of 

the animal, maintain animal and production records, provide necessary inputs and other 

obligations stipulated in the corresponding contract, and continuously engage in dairy 

business following approved practices and technologies provided by the PCC.  

 

10.11 The trustee in return will be given a chance to own purebred dairy animals as a 

means of additional livelihood opportunity and source of sustainable income. In this 

scheme, the ownership of the dam (original stock) was transferred to the trustee with the 

conditions that (a) the ownership of the offspring will be shared on a 50:50 basis by the 

trustee and the PCC; and (b) both parties have the option to buy the 50 percent share of 

who is willing to sell the share. 

 

10.12 Under the said scheme, the PCC’s obligations are to: (1) provide dairy buffaloes 

for loan to qualified farmers; (2) strengthen the skills and knowledge of the beneficiaries 

through community organizing activities, leadership training, and the like; (3) provide the 

needed technical support in health management (vaccination and other medical services 

within the means of PCC), breeding management, dairy production and management, 

record keeping and product development and marketing; (4) extend assistance and 

coordinate with the other government agencies in the acquisition of equipment for milking 

the animals and maintenance of quality milk, and other utensils for processing dairy 

products; and (5) explain thoroughly to the farmer/trustee the contents of the contract 

(Kaunduan sa Pagpapamahagi ng Puhunang Gatasan Kalabaw) including all the annexes 

thereof using the language that the farmer can comprehend and in the language being 

spoken in the municipality where the farmer reside. As a proof that the contract is clear to 

the farmer, Confirmation (Annex “C”) will be signed by him/her.  

 

Scope of Audit 

 

10.13 A Value-for-Money (VFM) audit was conducted specifically on the Modified 

“Paiwi” -Cooperative Dairy Module (CDM) implemented in the Province of Nueva Ecija 

and the operations of the National Gene Pool (NGP). The audit was limited to these two 

areas due to time constraints and the current condition brought about by the pandemic. 

 

Audit Objectives 

 

10.14 The audit aimed to ascertain the following objectives: 

 

a. To ascertain whether desired effects of the Modified Paiwi-CDM Program were 
sustained; and  

b. To determine whether the measures undertaken to reduce the mortality of buffaloes 
under the Modified Paiwi-CDM and the NGP were effective.   

 

 

 



95 
 

Audit Procedures Performed 

 

10.15 The Audit Team interviewed Agency personnel concerned involved in the 

implementation of the Program, supervisors of the NGP and the Saranay Animal Treatment 

Facility (now called the Livestock Biotechnology Research and Animal Facility 

{LBRAF}), and some farmer-beneficiaries. We also conducted ocular inspection of the 

said facilities and reviewed reports relevant to the Program. 

 

A. Modified Paiwi Program 
 

10.16 The previous VFM audit conducted for CYs 2015 to 2017 disclosed, among others, 

that the purpose of the “Paiwi Program” was attained satisfactorily in terms of provision 

of additional income to farmer-recipients from calf production and milk production. 

Reasonable volume of production was also sustained during the two-year period 2018 to 

2019 as presented below.  

 

Year 
Calf Production Milk Production 

Quantity Traded Value Quantity in Liters Traded Value 

2018 733   ₱ 10,995,000.00 1,149,706.41 ₱ 60,518.146.96 

2019 730 10,950,000.00 1,529,608.36 110,510,447.20 

Total 1,463 ₱ 21,945,000.00 2,679,314.77 ₱ 171,028,594.16 

  

10.17 Of the total calves produced of 1,463, a total of 129 and 169 female calves were 

loaned out in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Meanwhile, 784 male calves were culled 

through selling in order to take full advantage of the produce since only female buffaloes 

were essential in the milk production and in genetic improvement. 

 

10.18 According to Merriam-Webster, culling is the process of removing breeding 

animals from a group based on specific criteria. This is done either to reinforce certain 

desirable characteristics or to remove certain undesirable characteristics from the group. 

For livestock and wildlife alike, culling usually implies the killing of the removed animals. 

 

10.19 Interview with the NIZ personnel disclosed that all male calves were traded in the 

amount of ₱7,056,000.00 consisting of 427 heads at ₱3,843,000.00 and 357 heads at 

₱3,213,000.00 in CYs 2018 and 2019, respectively, raising an additional income for the 

beneficiaries. 

 

10.20 However, like the previous years, the high mortality of the animals severed the 

opportunity of the farmer-beneficiaries to increase income. The top leading causes of death 

were a) Foreign Body Syndrome/Hardware Disease; b) Fasciolosis/Liver Flukes, c) 

Pneumonia/Pulmonary Emphysema, and d) Bloat/Maldigestion/Impaction.  

 

10.21 In that respect, the PCC through the NIZ Team and Biosafety Units applied these 

strategies: (a) establishment of animal health hospital; (b) creation of task force Fasciola; 

and (c) increased monitoring.  

 



96 
 

10.22 There were two resident veterinarians in-charge of monitoring the animals under 

“Paiwi” together with the two trained technicians to assist in the monitoring. Their area of 

assignments and duties are summarized in Appendix M of this Report.   

 

Decreased mortality rate for the last three years 

 

10.23 Meanwhile, the Division concerned reported data on the mortality and ending 

inventory translated in a graphical presentation as shown below: 

 

 
 

10.24 Analysis of the above graph revealed a slight increase of 14.54% in the number of 

mortalities in CY 2018 as compared with that of CY 2017 while a substantial decrease was 

noted in CY 2019 by 38.09 percent as compared with that of CY 2018. 

  

10.25 The 5.65 percent mortality rate for CY 2018 was a bit higher than the mortality 

threshold of five percent for adult buffaloes, whereas in CY 2019, the mortality rate of 

.51% was well within the threshold. 

 

10.26 The reported causes of death of the buffaloes are tabulated below:

10.27 The foregoing table showed that in CY 2019, there were no cases of 

fasciolosis/liver fluke, pneumonia, foreign body syndrome/hardware disease which were 

the three leading causes of death in CYs 2013 to 2018. On the other hand, congestive heart 

failure/heart failure, multiple organ failure/multiple organ dysfunction, and 

cardiopulmonary failure became the other leading causes of death during that year while 

bloat/ruminal tympany case decreased by eight.  

 

10.28 A total of 167 animals were culled through selling in CYs 2018 and 2019 with a 

total book value of ₱6,801,375.00.  Sales proceeds amounted to ₱1,253,200.00, resulting 

in a net loss of ₱5,548,175.00. Out of the animals sold, 21 were crossbred valued at 

₱456,562.50 and were disposed of for only ₱142,500.00. This contributed to the 

aforementioned losses, details of which are shown in Appendix N.  

 



98 
 

10.29 It is also worth-mentioning that 46 of the 167 animals were culled due to 

reproductive problem and old age, while the remaining 125 heads underwent culling 

because of health deterioration. 

 

10.30 Although the death of the buffaloes significantly declined in CY 2019, the number 

of culled buffaloes has increased in a period of two years by 121 heads (average of 15 per 

year as compared with the 46 culled animals in CY 2017). This condition also affected the 

optimum realization of the objectives of the Program.  

 

10.31 The PCC personnel revealed that animals for culling were inspected first by the 

resident veterinarian and only those with corresponding Authority to Release (ATR) issued 

by the PCC could be culled. 

 

10.32 The animals were culled through selling due to different health/body/reproductive 

problems as shown in the succeeding graph. 

 

 
 

10.33 The foregoing graph disclosed that, except for the reproduction-related problems 

which were beyond everyone’s control, all factors contributing to the animals’ death could 

be kept at the lowest possible level had immediate preventive measures and good animal 

husbandry practices been properly observed.  

 

10.34 Reports showed that a total of 134 buffaloes for CYs 2018 and 2019 were brought 

to the animal health hospital for medical attention due to having thin/emaciated/body 

condition score of 2.25 below. Out of this number, 119 were healed, 12 were culled and 

three had died.  

 

10.35 Furthermore, it was learned from the Saranay Animal Treatment Facility Farm 

Supervisor that those 134 buffaloes were retrieved from negligent beneficiaries all over 

Region III and the 119 recuperated were re-loaned to other qualified farmer-beneficiaries. 

From that view, the Audit Team deduced that the ill condition of the animals was not 

properly reported by the trustee cooperatives/farmer beneficiaries.  

 

10.36 The resident veterinarian commented that farmer-beneficiaries seldom bring their 

ill animals in the animal health hospital because of related laws in transporting carabaos

from one Municipality to another. In addition, they only have hand tractor which is not the 

appropriate means of transportation based on the requirements of pertinent laws aside from 

the fact that the buffaloes are large enough for the hand tractor. 

 

10.37 It cannot be discounted that aforesaid undertakings of the PCC Management 

contributed to the decline of the number of deaths and eradication of the fasciolosis and 

pneumonia as among the primary causes of buffaloes’ death. Nevertheless, the population 

of buffaloes under the “Paiwi Scheme”, totaling to 7,657 as of December 31, 2019, is quite 

unmanageable considering that there were only two veterinarians, a mobile technician and 

a supervising livestock specialist in charge of their health monitoring not to mention the 

other tasks of these personnel under the Program.  

 

10.38 To augment the monitoring, the NIZ trained 29 veterinary aides and artificial 

insemination (AI) technicians affiliated in different cooperatives all over Nueva Ecija with 

the following duties: 

 
AI Technicians   Veterinary Aide 

1. Provision of AI services to dairy buffaloes in 
their respective areas of responsibilities. 

2. Conduct pregnancy diagnosis. 
3. Heat detection. 
4. Management of breeding program with their 

respective cooperatives. 

1. Monitoring of buffaloes within their respective 
cooperative; 

2. Provision of animal first aide or initial 
veterinary care for sick animals; 

3. Coordinate with Extension Veterinarian or 
Mobile Technician in case of emergency; 

4. Assist the Mobile Technician and Veterinarian 
on (a) deworming; (b) vaccination; (c) 

treatment of animals; and (d) collection of 

laboratory samples i.e. fecal, urine and blood; 

and 

5. Report cases of sick animals. 

 

10.39 The resident veterinarian, in an interview, stated that the presence of AI 

Technicians and Veterinary Aides helped them in monitoring the health and other minor 

concerns pertaining to the buffaloes. Initial medical attention/first aid was administered by 

the Veterinary Aide to the buffaloes with minor ailments through the Veterinary Aide thru 

the instructions of the Veterinarian which prevented the illness from turning to severe. In 

that way, illnesses were prevented from getting worse, thus, mitigating the incidence of 

death among the animals.  

  

10.40 Nevertheless, the same veterinarian admitted that in some cases the farmers failed 

to report to the veterinary aide the health condition of their animals because of the belief 

that it would get better eventually or in their judgment, the animal’s condition does not 

need immediate medical attention. In that instance, instead of having given immediate 

necessary treatment, the condition worsened and become unmanageable at the time of 

reporting.  

 

10.41 It is worth mentioning that under the dispositive portion of COA Decision No. 

2018-450 dated December 21, 2018, while the request for relief from accountability on the 

death of the buffalo was granted, the PCC was required to undertake a thorough 



100 
 

investigation of the numerous deaths of buffaloes and improve their health care to pursue 

the Program more efficiently and effectively.  

 

B. National Gene Pool (NGP) at PCC National Headquarters and Gene Pool (PCC 
NHGP)  

 

10.42 The NGP at PCC NHGP in Science City of Munoz, Nueva Ecija serves, among 

others, as the Nucleus/Breeder Farm where the genetically superior animals will be sourced 

out. It is where the herd of elite riverine buffalos (Murrah-based) for milk production are 

taken care of. In the beginning of CY 2020, there were 522 heads of buffaloes being tended 

thereat, aged less than a year old to more than four years old, with a total value of 

₱9,829,500.00. 

 

10.43 Ocular inspection at the NGP was conducted by the AT and observed that there 

were seven houses for the herd. According to the Farm Supervisor, house number five is 

intended solely as isolation pen wherein the sick buffaloes are being monitored while half 

of the house number four is for isolation and the other half is for the pregnant buffaloes 

and animals used for research. However, the said house is under repair. There is also a 

house intended for the lactating buffaloes, pregnant animals aside from house four, and a 

maternity pen for the pre-partum and post-partum animals. Likewise, separate barns are 

provided for the nursing calves, and the weaned calves. 

 

10.44 There is also a working corral to facilitate weighing, blood collection, deworming, 

examination, and segregation of the animals as well as holding area where the lactating 

buffaloes are bathe while waiting for their turn for milking at the milking parlor. Milk 

extraction is done at 4:00 o’clock in the morning and 3:00 o’clock in the afternoon. 

Interview with the personnel concerned disclosed that milking of a lactating buffalo lasts 

for about seven to 12 minutes but when the milk let is slow, it will take around 15 minutes.  

 

10.45 We also observed that there are separate storages for the feed concentrates, silage, 

and rice straws and fresh grass for the buffaloes, and a farm machinery shed where the 

equipment and tractors utilized in the operation of the NGP are being kept. There is also 

water supply for the buffaloes while the Napier grass are being grown in some areas within 

the compound of the PCC NHGP. 

 

10.46 Basically, the buffaloes in the NGP were provided with appropriate shelter and 

facilities. 

 

Slight decrease in mortality rate in CY 2020 

 

10.47 Meanwhile, previous reports during the years 2017 to 2019 disclosed deaths of 108 

heads and for CY 2020 mortality stood at 36 heads as shown in the table below:  

 
 2017 2018 2019 2020 

Calves - 15 17 10 

Adult 36 18 22 26 

Total 36 33 39 36 



101 
 

10.48 The above data disclosed that mortality had a slight increase in CY 2019 and an 

insignificant decrease in 2020 in spite of the measures adopted by the Management in 

animal health care as presented below. 

 

a. As to Manpower 
 

 Hiring of female animal-handler to take care of the nursing calf up to four 
months 

 Orientation and familiarization of the animal handlers/caretakers and milkers 
on early sign and symptoms of diseases 

 Hauler from the forage group were assigned in the distribution of feed 
concentrate in the morning for the animal caretaker to have time, early in the 

morning and while the animals are feeding feed concentrate, to monitor and 

observe animal with early sign of disease (e.g. nasal discharge, limping, listless, 

lethargic, anorectic, presence of foul smell, etc.) assigning of one technical staff 

in addition to one farm laborer to monitor the animals at night and provide first 

aide treatment to the animal if needed 

 Division of area to supervise amongst the technical staff of the farm (Dairy 
Herd Management, Forage and Pasture, Milking Operation and Farm Facility 

and Equipment Monitoring and Maintenance) 

 

b. As to Barn 
 

 Provision of additional windows in the calf barn to facilitate air exchange inside 
the animal house 

 Provision of ventilation fan in the milking parlor for fast air exchange and 
maintenance of comfortable ambient temperature inside the parlor 

 Provision of ventilation fan to maintain comfortable ambient temperature in 
House 1 (lactating animals barn), and House 2 (pregnant animals barn) 

 Regular cleaning of animal pen and disinfection prior to transfer of animals 
  

c. As to Food  
 

 Monitoring of forage production and maintenance of Forage Production 
Performance Database to ensure continuous supply of roughages 

 Regular updating of Feeding Ration depending on the number of animals per 
house and per physiological stage (calf, yearling, pregnant, lactating, etc.)  

 

d. As to Animals 
 

 Inclusion of mineral supplement in the feed concentrate: calcium-phosphorus 
supplement for the lactating and pregnant animals; vitamin-mineral mix for 

growing calves 

 Collection and testing of blood samples on the onset of possible infectious or 
chronic diseases 



102 
 

 Use of Daily Veterinary Report Form for the ease of analysis and extraction of 
history of medication and monitoring schedule of the succeeding regular health 

activities 

 

e. Others 
 

 Transfer of sick animals to individual pen in House 4 or House 5 for close 
monitoring and ease of medication/treatment 

 Use of loafing area after milking to reduce or prevent occurrence of mastitis 
    

10.49 The usual causes of death in CY 2018 based on records and notices from the 

Management were a) pulmonary diseases; b) ruminal tympany; c) hardware 

diseases/foreign body syndrome/peritonitis; d) trichobezoar; e) ruminal impaction bloat; f) 

pericarditis/heart failure; g) uterine prolapse; h) multiple organ failure; i) prolapse; j) 

neurological diseases; k) digestive diseases, and others like abomasal displacement and 

intracerebral hemorrhages.  

 

10.50 In CY 2019, the PCC lost nine heads in which the highest cause of death was 

identified as ruminal tympany or bloat. The incidence or severity of this condition was 

higher during night-time possibly because buffaloes are inactive during the night and 

because they are not seen, detected, and treated immediately.  

 

10.51 In order to address this, the Farm Supervisor implemented the audit 

recommendations in CY 2019 by assigning additional technical staff at night to monitor 

the animal during night time and to administer first aide treatment as necessary.  

 

10.52 In addition, some interventions were administered to alleviate the incidence of other 

diseases through additional ventilation in the calf barns, mineral blocks in the animal pen, 

and by carrying out regular health programs. 

 

10.53 The undertakings of the Farm Supervisor may be fairly effective as manifested in 

the decrease in mortality of three heads from 39 in CY 2019 and 36 in CY 2020 and the 

decline in the incidence of ruminal tympany/bloat from nine in the previous year to just 

only two incidents during the year 2020.  

 

10.54 Relatively, the population of culled animals with poor body condition dropped from 

23 heads to four which could be attributed to the effectiveness of interventions 

administered in the NGP. 

 

10.55 On the other hand, during the year 2020, the NGP’s records of death showed that 

multiple organ dysfunction/multiple organ failure ranked the highest among the identified 

causes, as tabulated in the succeeding table: 

 
Cause/s of Death Calf Adult Total

17. Trichobezoar 1 1 2 

Total 10 26 36 

 

10.56 The PCC Veterinarians previously explained that the tolerable rate of mortality for 

calves is ten percent and only five percent for adult buffaloes based on the established 

standard in line with the objective of the Integrated Management Systems (IMS). The 

mortality rate was computed as the actual number of deaths divided by the total number of 

animals as at year-end including the animals which died during the period. 

 

10.57 Considering the data in the preceding table, the mortality rate for the adult buffaloes 

equaled the tolerable rate of five percent while the mortality rate for the calves is 1.98 

percent which is within the tolerable rate of 10 percent. 

 

10.58 Aside from death caused by diseases, inventory of the animals also decreased due 

to culling, among others.  

 

10.59 The Audit Team categorized the reported reasons for culling into five categories; 

viz: 

 

a. Reproduction-Related – hard to impregnate, frequent aborter, with reproductive 
problem, recurring prolapsed;  

b. Physical Injuries – fracture leg, dislocated joint, broken calcanean tendon and 
severed hock, spinal/cervical injury; 

c. Poor Body Condition – loss of condition, limping, not responding to treatment, 
emaciated, extremely weak and downer;  

d. Physical Characteristics – not fit for breeding, mastitic, 
damage/small/deformed/uneven/broken/dead teats and glands, stunted growth, 

aggressive, twisted/banana type testicles, with hernia, deformed udder, difficult to 

handle, undescended testis, abnormal gait, small and split testicles; and 



104

Decrease in the number of culled animals due to poor body condition 

  

10.60 For the three-year period covered 2018 to 2020, the data gathered pertaining to the 

culling of animals being tended at the NGP are graphically presented hereunder: 

 

 
 

10.61 As can be gleaned in the foregoing graph, aside from the poor body condition, 

reproduction-related and physical characteristics categories shared the most number of 

culled animals. The personnel concerned asserted that the animals were culled because 

only genetically superior animals are being preserved for the genetic improvement since 

any physical abnormality, genetic defects, and unpleasant traits/features of the dam and 

sire could be transferred to their offspring. 

 

10.62 In an interview, the Audit Team learned that the estimated breeding values (EBV) 

and the physical characteristics of the animals (heifer and bull calves) are being considered 

in the evaluation of the potential dam and sire. The breeding value was defined in Dairy 

Buffalo Production Handbook as a measure of the genetic merit of each animal. It makes 

ranking and comparison of animals within and across-herd easier.  

 

10.63 The respective EBV is being evaluated under Animal Breeding and Genomics 

Section (ABGS) while physical evaluation of the bull calves is carried out at the Livestock 

Biotechnology Research and Animal Facility (LBRAF) in which the animal hospital is also 

situated. All bulls from the NGP were transferred therein for evaluation as well as those 

animals for research purposes (for reproduction and for nutrition research), and weak 

animals for rehabilitation.  The LBRF is located at Brgy. Saranay, San Jose City, Nueva 

Ecija.

105 
 

10.64 Those animals found with low EBV and with genetic defects, physical 

abnormalities and with unpleasant traits/features will be considered for voluntary culling 

in spite of being healthy and no existing reproductive problem to hasten genetic 

improvement. However, those that will meet the criteria will be separated for tender, love 

and care (TLC).  

 

10.65 In case of the bull calves, the same will be either potential semen donors or for bull 

loan. Those that are potential semen donors will be transferred to the National Bull Farm 

(NBF) at Brgy. Joson, formerly Brgy. Digdig, Carranglan, Nueva Ecija.  Meanwhile, those 

that are for Bull Loan will either be retained at the LBRAF to be trained to mount a buffalo 

in preparation for actual natural breeding or breeding services, or will be directly 

transferred to the respective PC Centers. They are also trained to be tamed for easy 

management of bull handlers when they are released. Likewise, evaluation of the animals’ 

performance is conducted at least once a year to determine if they are still productive and 

can still stay in the herd, and with considerable EBV, otherwise, the animals will be 

recommended for voluntary culling. 

 

10.66 Nevertheless, physical injuries and poor body condition of the animals could also 

be prevented through proper animal husbandry practices unlike the concerns classified as 

reproduction-related and physical characteristics.  As such, the number of animals culled 

due to physical injuries and poor body condition should also be of concern as potential 

breeders for genetic improvement may come from them.    

 

Releases of potential breeders for genetic improvement 

 

10.67 As mentioned in the preceding discussion, all bulls are transferred to LBRAF for 

physical evaluation to determine those with potentials and with superior breed. Similarly, 

information from NGP pertaining to animal releases related to genetic improvement are 

presented below.

10.68 As can be seen in the preceding table, out of the 121 bulls transferred to LBRAF, 

34 heads were loaned to different recipients, and two semen donors were transferred to the 

National Bull Farm (NBF) at Brgy. Joson formerly Brgy. Digdig, Carranglan, Nueva Ecija. 

Releases from the NGP were 49, 13, and 40 for bull loan, semen collection, and loan, 

respectively. The transferred animals to the two PC centers totaling to 11 heads were also 



106 
 

for bull loan.  All in all, 109 heads were produced for genetic improvement program during 

the three-year period; to wit:

10.69 The 40 heads of female buffaloes from the NGP were also loaned out to different 

recipients in support of the CBED Program of the PCC which is one of the major 

springboards in the development of local dairy industry using the carabao as economic 

resource of smallholder farmers. 

 

Calf Production surpassed the target consistently for the last three years 

 

10.70 In addition to that, we gathered that the calves produced in the NGP for the three-

year period from which the potential breeder will arise surpassed the target as shown in the 

succeeding graph. 
              

 
 

10.71 As exhibited in the succeeding table, the NGP produced 572,094 liters of milk for 

three years. Out of this volume, a total of 202,173 liters of which were fed to the calves 

while the remaining 369,921 valued at ₱26,469,025.00 were delivered and processed in the 

Central Dairy Collection and Processing Facility (CDCPF) maintained by the PCC NGHP. 

The value of milk was then paid out of the Revolving Fund (RF) of Milka Krem to NGP 

which in turn formed part of the RF of the NGP. The amounts collected are being utilized 

for the operation at the NGP when the fund allocated from the General Fund is inadequate. 

In addition, the Program Management Committee (PMC) in CY 2019 approved through 

Resolution that the said collection could be utilized also for the procurement of necessary 

machineries in the operation of the NGP.

Total 572,094 202,173 369,921 ₱26,469,025.00 

 

10.72 Overall, it could be deduced that the measures undertaken to mitigate the mortality 

problems were fairly effective, based on the data gathered and ocular inspection conducted 

as manifested by the following: (a) decrease in mortality of three heads; (b) the decline in 

the incidence of ruminal tympany/bloat from nine to two incidents during the year 2020; 

and (c) culled animals with poor body condition dropped from 23 heads to four. However, 

the mortality rate for adult buffaloes during the year 2020 exactly equaled the tolerable 

limit established by the Agency which means that the total mortalities were in brink of 

exceeding the threshold, which may affect the sustainability of the genetic improvement 

program in the coming years. In the same manner, the number of animals culled due to 

physical injuries and poor body condition should not be disregarded since the potential 

breeders that would contribute to the genetic improvement may arise from them.  

 

10.73 It is of significance that early in CY 2021, the PCC NHGP updated its Gene Pool 

Herd Health Program. The said program aims to ensure that the routing Herd Health 

Management activities in the farm are properly implemented to be able to prevent and 

minimize disease occurrence for optimum performance of the animals. 

 

10.74 The personnel in-charge of the Modified Paiwi Program explained during the exit 

conference that the 167 heads culled animals had already produced their replacement stock 

and contributed to the income of dairy farmer prior to the culling process as manifested by 

the calves produced totaling to 1,463 heads. Moreover, although the animals were culled 

due to illness and other reasons as stated in the audit report, upon analysis of the age of the 

animals as shown in table below, 87.5 percent of the 167 culled animals are considered old 

with ages ranging from 10 to 19 years old. 

 
Birth Year Number of Born Buffalo (Head) Estimated Age as of 2021 

2002 1 19 years old 
2003 1 18 
2006 4 15 
2008 3 13 
2009 147 12

2013 3 8 
2014 2 7 
2015 2 6 
Total 167 Range - 6 to 19 years old 

 

10.75 Those animals that are within the life span of 10 to 19 years old are considered in 

the declining period in terms of their productive life and they may no longer produce calf 



108 
 

and milk efficiently. Hence, the process of culling is an intervention to recover the 

₱1,253,200.00 salvaged value of the animals. 

 

10.76 In addition, as regards mortality in the Gene Pool, though there is a decrease in calf 

mortality, there is a slight increase in adult mortality, this is mainly because there are 

animals that showed the same manifestation of disease (circling) distributed from the 

month of January to October 2020 but failed to recuperate from the illness. These animals, 

though with good body condition, were maintained in the farm upon onset of the disease 

to undergo several diagnostic test (blood test and bacterial culture from brain sample) to 

determine the causative agent of the disease and also undergo different treatment regimen 

to determine which is the most effective against the said disease. The information gathered 

during the treatment of these animals will be used for future reference should the same 

symptoms of the disease manifest. 
 

10.77 Aside from the programs implemented last 2020, additional improvements in the 

health management are yet be done. Improvement of management practices and facilities 

that may contribute to the general well-being of the animals are still ongoing, as 

enumerated below: 
 

 Improvement of farm practices and facilities in preparation for registration for 
Animal Welfare Act compliance and Good Animal Husbandry Practices 

Certification  

 Review, re-evaluation and redesign of Herd Health Management Program 

 Prohibition of entry of private vehicles in the farm 
 Repair of House No. 4 that will be used as Pregnant Animals and Maternity Barn 

 

10.78 We recommended and the OIC –Executive Director agreed to undertake the 

following courses of action: 

 

(a)  reassess workloads as well as the duties and responsibilities of the veterinarians 

and personnel responsible for the monitoring of the 7,657 buffaloes entrusted 

to the different farmer-beneficiaries of different cooperatives in Nueva Ecija; 

  

(b) consider hiring additional veterinarians/staff or revision of their duties and 

responsibilities if the result of reassessment requires for it;  

 

(c) encourage the farmer-beneficiaries to immediately report the health condition 

of their animals for immediate medical attention; 

  

(d) if possible, revisit the policies and guidelines of the “PAIWI” Scheme and 

institute safeguards to prevent numerous deaths and culling of animals; and 

  

(e)  consider the statement under the dispositive portion of COA Decision No. 

2018-450 dated December 21, 2018 encouraging the PCC to conduct thorough 

investigation on the deaths of the buffaloes to prevent further loss of 

government property. 



109 
 

10.79 We further recommended and the OIC –Executive Director agreed to (a) 

evaluate the circumstances and causes of the diseases which led to death and culling 

among the herd in spite of the interventions observed in the NGP; and (b) 

conscientiously observe the routine activities in the Herd Health Program to attain 

the objectives of preventing and minimizing the occurrence of diseases for the 

optimum performance of the animals.   
 

 

Implementation of Establishment of Province-Wide Carabao-Based Business Improvement 

Network (CBIN) 

 

11. Audit of the implementation of the Province-Wide Carabao-Based Business 

Improvement (CBIN) of the different Philippine Carabao Centers (PCCs) disclosed 

observations, such as (a) delayed project implementation; (b) late dispersal of animals to 

intended beneficiaries; (c) unsubstantiated distribution of buffaloes; (d) no provision in 

the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) on the acquisition and disposition of motor 

vehicles/equipment turned over to a Cooperative; (e ) breach of contract resulting in 

undelivered buffaloes while animal/zoological supplies were distributed to a non-

legitimate recipient; and (f) absence of list of intended farmer-beneficiaries. Such lapses 

hindered the full attainment of the objectives of the Program and the enjoyment of the 

benefits by the beneficiaries thereof.  
 

11.1 In CY 2019, the Philippine Carabao Center, National Headquarters and Gene Pool 

(PCC NHGP) was under a reenacted budget based on FY 2018 in which the Locally Funded 

Projects were not included until the signing of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for 

FY 2019 on April 15, 2019 by President Rodrigo R. Duterte. 

 

11.2 On June 19, 2019, through the Department of Agriculture (DA) Secretary, the PCC 

NHGP requested for the issuance of a Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) intended 

for the Locally Funded Projects entitled Establishment of Province Wide Carabao-Based 

Business Improvement Network and Establishment of Carabao Industry Hub in Antique 

Province amounting to ₱160,000,000.00 and ₱25,000,000.00, respectively. Included in the 

said request was an Authority to Purchase Motor Vehicles which were programmed in the 

aforementioned projects with the following objectives:

11.3 On October 24, 2019, the DBM released to PCC the Special Allotment Release 

Order (SARO) with reference number BMB-E-19-0016638 and the initial release of Notice 

of Cash Allocation (NCA) No. BMB-E-19-0020691 amounting to ₱185,000,000.00 and 

₱175,750,000.00, respectively, including the Authority to Purchase Vehicles.  

 

11.4 The aforesaid projects will be implemented by the Philippine Carabao Centers (PC 
Centers) nationwide where the location of implementation of the Program is under its 

regional jurisdiction. 

 

11.5 Presented below are the audit observations on the CBIN implementation of the 
different PC Centers nationwide; to wit: 

 

a. Delayed project implementation (PCC at Central Luzon State University) 

 

11.6 Out of the funds of ₱26,907,533.63 received from the PCC NHGP for the 
implementation of the CBIN, 73.32% or ₱19,727,931.56 was utilized, and the balance of 

₱7,179,602.07 or 26.68% was reverted to the National Treasury for the suspended works 

and activities programmed under the said project due to constraints brought about by the 

pandemic; thus, the optimum expected benefits to be derived therefrom were not fully 

realized. 

 

11.7 Among those implementing PC Centers is the Philippine Carabao Center at Central 
Luzon State University (PCC at CLSU) located at Science City of Muñoz, Nueva Ecija. 

As such, the fund for the implementation of the CBIN in the Municipalities of Dinalupihan, 

and Orani in Bataan, and in the Province of Tarlac was transferred to PCC at CLSU in the 

amount of ₱26,907,533.63; to wit:

11.11 Clearly, the above pertained to the CY 2019 funding and, therefore, understood to 
be utilized only for that year. However, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11464, An Act Extending 

the Availability of the 2019 Appropriations to December 31, 2020, Amending for the 

Purpose Section 65 of the General Provisions of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11260, or The 

General Appropriations Act (GAA) of Fiscal Year 2019, provides the following: 

 

Section 1. Section 65 of the 2019 General Appropriations Act or Republic 

Act No. 11260 is hereby amended to read as follows: 

 

Sec. 65. Availability of Appropriations. -  All appropriations authorized in 

this Act shall be available for release and obligation for the purpose 

specified, and under the same special provisions applicable, thereto, until 

December 31, 2020. (emphasis ours) 

 

xxx  

 

11.12 As could be gleaned in the foregoing table, the percentage of fund utilization for 
MOOE was only 42.60% wherein the Training Expenses shared the highest unexpended 

balance of ₱3,701,737.00 which means that some of the trainings that the beneficiaries 

have to undergo in the operations of the project provided to them were not conducted. 

Likewise, the fund utilization insofar as the CO is concerned was 99 percent of the allotted 

amount.  

 

11.13 In view of the abovementioned provision, the unobligated balance of ₱7,179,602.07 
was reverted to the National Treasury despite the fact that the PC Center still needed the 

fund. 

 

11.14 The PCC at CLSU Management reprogrammed their Annual Procurement Plan 
(APP); however, they were advised by the PCC NHGP Budget Office that it was no longer 



113 
 

allowed since R.A. 11464 extended the utilization of the CY 2019 fund until December 31, 

2020 only. It is of significance that the Center Director and the designated CBIN Program 

Coordinator assumed their post only on the later part of CY 2020. 

 

11.15 Furthermore, they reported that the low utilization of the fund allotted for the 
training was due to restrictions concerning the pandemic in the respective location of the 

project. Similarly, a small number of staff was hired and several works programmed and 

scheduled activities were suspended. 

 

11.16 Be as it may, the optimum expected benefits from the projects and activities funded 
from the government funds were not fully realized. 

 

11.17 The Center Director during the exit Conference averred that given the current 
pandemic, implementation of the project was delayed, thus, one reason for not meeting 

performance targets.  He also explained that the audit observation will be included in their 

agenda for the upcoming meeting among the PC Center officials concerned. 

 

11.18 We recommended and the Center Director agreed to instruct the Program 
Coordinator and other officials/personnel concerned to (i) formulate physical plans 

for future programs that are attainable within the target period considering the 

constraints encountered in the implementation of existing programs; and (ii) ensure 

the attainment of optimum expected benefits from the program to the advantage of 

the intended beneficiaries thru effective planning. 
 

b. Delayed delivery of carabaos to intended beneficiaries (PCC at Central Mindanao 

University) 

 

11.19 It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be 
managed, expended or utilized in accordance with laws and regulations, and safeguarded 

against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring 

efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of the government. The 

responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the 

chief or head of the government agency concerned. (Sec. 2, P.D. No. 1445) 

 

11.20 With the general objective of propelling an inclusive, sustainable, and highly 
competitive local dairy industry, the Carabao-based Business Improvement Network 

(“ALAB-KARBAWAN”) was established with the Philippine Carabao Center as one of 

the implementing agencies.  Specific objectives of the project included engaging 17 

established cooperatives (including one for Misamis Oriental with PCC at CMU as 

implementing agency) and 17 LGUs as focal partner for the ALAB KARBAWAN, 

distribute dairy carabaos to qualified farmers, produce raw milk, generate ₱4M pesos from 

sales of raw milk and encourage women’s participation in all activities of the project, 

among others.   

 

11.21 The Philippine Carabao Center at CMU Musuan, Maramag, Bukidnon is a recipient 
of funds for locally funded projects in the total amount of ₱9,744,965.88, consisting of 



114 
 

₱4,239,059.88 for Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) and 

₱5,505,906.00 for Capital Outlay (CO), of which ₱9,417,500.00 was received on 

November 8, 2019 and ₱327,465.88 on March 3, 2020. An additional fund was 

downloaded during the year in the amount of ₱321,557.88 for MOOE and ₱1,338,908.00 

for CO, bringing the total releases for the project to ₱11,405,431.76. 

 

11.22 The Audit Team reported that the Financial Reports as of December 31, 2020 
showed that a total of ₱2,053,610.86 or 45% of the total amount of ₱4,560,619.76 for 

MOOE, and ₱1,417,744.00 or 21% of the total allotment of ₱6,844,812.00 for CO 

remained unexpended as presented in the succeeding table partly because of the practice 

of conducting the public bidding for the major requirements of the project (facilities, 

equipment and breeding stocks) at the PCC NHGP, thus, defeating the purpose of the 

project.

11.23 Likewise, it was reported that the Contract for the purchase of 60 buffalos under 
the CBIN for Misamis Oriental was terminated due to the failure of the supplier to deliver 

the required quantity of carabaos resulting in the delayed implementation of the project as 

well as delayed delivery of the supposed benefits to the targeted beneficiaries contrary to 

the guidelines of the project and the declared policy of the State on the efficient use of 

government resources. 

 

11.24 Verification of records showed that the conduct of public bidding for the major 
requirements for the project (facilities, equipment and breeding stocks) is being done at the 

PCC NHGP. The personnel involved in the implementation of the project were able to 

perform some of the required activities based on the prescribed timeline as shown in the 

photo documentation submitted  to the Audit Team but majority were not undertaken. 

 

11.25 Records revealed that on December 11, 2019, the PCC former Executive Director 
entered into a contract with the AS Aqua Agri-Products and Enterprises for the delivery of 

60 heads of buffalos in the total amount of ₱2,849,700.00 within 90 days upon issuance of 

the Notice to Proceed (NTP), completion of which was scheduled on March 26, 2020.  



115 
 

11.26 The supplier delivered eight  buffalos where four were rejected since they failed to 
meet the specifications set in the contract. The Center Director clarified that the delay in 

the delivery of carabaos was due to failure to meet the specifications on some of the animals 

delivered which resulted in the termination of the contract and the rebidding for the 

delivery of the remaining required buffalos.  Copy of recommendation for termination of 

the contract from the Center, verified recommending report, order to terminate the contract 

and the notice to terminate the contract were submitted to the Audit Team. 

 

11.27 The processing of payment for the total cost of the four delivered carabaos 
amounting to ₱189,980.00 is still in process. As of October 9, 2020, the number of carabaos 

intended for dispersal to the qualified farmers of the Province of Misamis Oriental 

remained at four heads and still at the center in Musuan, Maramag, Bukidnon contrary to 

the timeline set for dispersal of the carabaos which should have started in August 2019.   

  

11.28 Interview with the Center Director disclosed that the delay in the delivery of the 
buffalos prevented him from disbursing the funds intended for the project as these includes 

assistance to the farmers in the proper care of the buffalos like feeds, medicines and other 

needs of the buffalos.  To catch up with the slow phase of utilization, the Center Director 

during the interview elaborated their plan which included fast-tracking of the procurement 

and delivery of the remaining 46 crossbreeds, realignment of MOOE for the purchase of 

additional processing and marketing supplies and materials and other mitigation activities.   

 

11.29 The Center Director also disclosed that from the supposed remaining 56 carabaos 
for procurement, the requirement was changed to 46 heads due to increase in the unit price 

to entice more suppliers to participate in the bidding.   As of December 31, 2020, 35 

carabaos were already delivered to the Center, but still not yet dispersed to the identified 

beneficiaries. The remaining 15 carabaos are scheduled to be delivered on January 10, 

2021.  

 

11.30 Moreover,  on January 27, 2020 a contract was drawn between  the then Executive 
Director of PCC and the management of Visayan Northstar Enterprises for the delivery of 

one containerized milk processing system in the amount of ₱1,963,088.00 which was 

delivered in September 2020 and inspected in the presence of the Supervising Auditor on 

September 25, 2020. The delivery of the equipment was far beyond the schedule set in the 

timeline which should have been in December 2019. Based on the terms of reference and 

conditions, delivery period was within 180 calendar days upon receipt of the Notice to 

Proceed (NTP). The equipment remained uninstalled as of this writing, thus, should have 

been subjected to liquidated damages. 

 

11.31 The Management commented that the present fund utilization for the project was 
obligated at least 87 to 97% of the budget. Accordingly, the CBIN fund shall be fully 

disbursed until June 30, 2021. 

 

11.32 They further commented that the previous supplier for the purchase of the 60 
buffaloes was recommended for termination because the supplier cannot deliver the 

required number of animals on time. Only four animals were delivered and accepted. Re-



116 
 

bidding by the Central Office was conducted; however, the specifications were modified 

and the price was increased from the previous price of ₱50,000 to ₱60,000 each with the 

same budget; hence, the number of animals was reduced. The second supplier was JRA 

Livestock Buyer & Supplier from Cebu. At present, the carabaos, composed of 46 

crossbreeds, were already delivered, inspected and accepted based on the specified 

requirements and payment processed. 

 

11.33 Furthermore, the PC Center accordingly rehabilitated the animals so as to reach 
their productive weight with good body condition and aimed to impregnate these animals 

first prior to their entrustment so that farmers can engage in milking activities earlier to 

provide them additional income. 

 

11.34 The respective Audit Team recommended that the Management of PCC at 
CMU (a) make constant follow ups with the PCC Headquarters for the early conduct 

of bidding to catch up with the implementation schedule of the project and maximize 

the utilization of funds; and (b) fast track the implementation of the identified 

projects as planned (dispersal of buffalos to the targetted beneficiaries, installation of 

the milk processing equipment and construction of the required structures) for the 

benefit of the farmers as well as the general public. 
 

c. Unsubstantiated distribution of 44 heads of female buffaloes (PCC at Don Mariano 

Marcos Memorial State University) 

 

11.35 Section 2 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, known as the Government 
Accounting Code of the Philippines, provides that: 

 

It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government 

shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and 

regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or 

improper disposition, with a view to efficiency, economy and effectiveness 

in the operation of the government. 

 

11.36 One of the programs of the Projects entitled “Establishment of Province-Wide-
Carabao-Based Business Improvement Network (CBIN)” is the entrustment of dairy 

buffaloes which includes awarding of animals for herd build-up in the province. 

 

11.37 The PCC at DMMMSU was able to procure 50 heads of female crossbred buffaloes 
for eventual distribution to farmer-beneficiaries in the Province of Pangasinan. 
 
11.38 Validation of distribution, however, revealed that supporting documents to 
evidence receipt of 44 heads of buffaloes by the beneficiaries were not available such as 

the MOA entered into by and between the PCC and the recipients and the Acceptance Form 

that is made an integral part of the MOA. The Acceptance Form contains the breed, animal 

ID number and the cost of the animal. The Management of PCC at DMMMSU claimed 

that the MOAs are still with the recipients for their signature and were not yet returned as 

of date of audit. Only five of the MOA were presented during the conduct of verification. 



117 
 

11.39 Granting a list of the beneficiaries was provided by the Management, the same 
could not be considered as proof of receipt since it was not signed by the recipients. While 

15 heads were confirmed received thru telephone call, it is still best to secure the 

documentary evidence, hence, the need for the signed MOAs as these will serve as valid 

proof of receipt by the beneficiaries. 

 

11.40 Considering the lapse of time since the buffaloes were actually awarded, the MOAs 
should have been signed and returned by the beneficiaries not only to support the 

distribution, but for the Center to take hold of the documents to enforce compliance by the 

beneficiaries with the provisions of the MOA and relieve the Center from liability in cases 

of losses or deaths of the animal. 

 

11.41 The Audit Team of PCC at DMMMSU recommended that Management 
retrieve the MOA duly signed by the recipients in order to fully support the 

distribution of the buffaloes and at the same time relieve the Center from liability in 

cases of losses or deaths of the animals. 
 

d. No provision in the MOA on the acquisition/disposition of motor vehicles/equipment 
turned over to a Cooperative (PCC at La Carlota Stock Farm) 

 

11.42 The Memorandum of Agreement between PCC LCSF and the San Julio Agrarian 
Reform Beneficiaries Cooperative (SJARBC) did not contain sufficient provisions 

regarding the disposition of motor vehicles, machineries and equipment amounting to 

₱1,999,695.20 which may result in the difficulty in determining the accountability over 

these assets necessary for the efficient implementation of the CBIN.  

 
11.43 Audit of the Audit Team assigned at the PCC at LCSF disclosed that the San Julio 
Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Cooperative (SJARBC) was identified and selected by the 

PCC-LCSF as the recipient for the implementation of the Program in coordination with the 

Local Government Unit (LGU) of Tanjay City pursuant to the CCS guidelines on selection 

of the qualified beneficiaries.  The Cooperative is located at Hacienda San Julio, Sta. Cruz 

Viejo, Tanjay City, Negros Oriental.  It is registered with the Cooperative Development 

Authority under registration number 9520-07014801 dated March 22, 2010.  Its business 

operation includes rice production and common service facility operation.   

 

11.44 The review of the Agreement between the PCC-LCSF and the SJARBC pertaining 
to the implementation of the CBIN program disclosed that the obligations of the parties 

focused only on the dispersal of 40 heads of buffaloes.   

 

11.45 It was noted, however, that the other assets procured for the project such as motor 
vehicles, equipment, and machineries for milk processing were not mentioned under the 

section on Obligations of the Parties.  Since these assets were for distribution and turnover 

to the cooperative, a provision should have been included in the Agreement detailing the 

terms and conditions as well as the responsibilities of both parties regarding the recording 

and disposition thereof. 

 



118 
 

11.46 The post-audit of the transactions under the CBIN program for CY 2020 showed 
that the PCC at LCSF purchased the following assets in the total amount of ₱1,999,695.20 

for distribution to the SJARBC: 

 

Motor Vehicles ₱ 1,364,094.00 

Other Machineries and Equipment 635,601.20 

Total  ₱ 1,999,695.20 

 

11.47 The motor vehicles purchased consisted of three motorcycles and one Isuzu D-Max.  
PCC at LCSF already turned over one motorcycle to the SJARBC while the other two 

motorcycles are still with PCC-LCSF, awaiting guidelines from the PCC NHGP as regards 

the ownership of all the motor vehicles.  On the other hand, the Isuzu D-Max is stationed 

in PCC at LCSF.  The Audit Team interviewed the Project-in-Charge and gathered that all 

the motor vehicles are intended for the implementation of the CBIN and the other 

machineries and equipment were already turned over to the SJARBC. 

 

11.48 The absence of terms and conditions in the Agreement may ultimately result to 
difficulty in ultimately determining accountability for the said assets used in the effective 

implementation of the Program. 

 

11.49 The Audit Team of PCC at LCSF recommended and Management, thru the 
Center Director, agreed to revisit the existing MOA and prepare amendments thereto 

so that the responsibilities and obligations of both parties pertaining to the assets 

purchased and turned over to the Cooperative will be clearly specified therein. 
 

e. Breach of contract resulting in undelivered buffaloes while animal/zoological supplies 
were distributed to a non-legitimate recipient (PCC at Mariano Marcos State 

University)  

 

11.50 Only 10 heads of buffalo out of 40 heads subject of procurement under the CBIN 
“ALAB-KARBAWAN” were delivered to PCC at MMSU for failure of the Supplier to 

deliver in full the subject of the contract; thus, the targeted number of Cooperative/Farmer-

Beneficiaries was not served, depriving them of the benefits that could be derived 

therefrom. Moreover, animal/zoological supplies amounting to ₱217,650.00 were 

distributed to a Cooperative which is not a legitimate recipient of buffaloes and related 

support and services depriving the legitimate/intended beneficiaries from enjoying needed 

support and benefit under the same program. 

 

11.51 The Procurement of 40 heads Crossbred Buffaloes (female) for delivery to PCC at 
MMSU in carrying out the above Program was conducted by the PCC Head Office and 

such was awarded to A.S. Aqua-Agri Products and Enterprises (AAPE).  The Notice to 

Proceed (NTP) was confirmed by the Supplier on November 18, 2019 and was given a 60-

day delivery term effective upon acknowledgment of the NTP, or on January 20, 2020.  On 

June 25, 2020, after incurring 98 days of delay, a partial delivery of ten buffaloes was made 

by AAPE at PCC at MMSU, City of Batac.   

 



119 
 

11.52 No subsequent deliveries were ever made by the AAPE for the remaining 30 

undelivered buffaloes. As such, on July 21, 2020, the Center Director issued a 

Memorandum for the Executive Director of PCC Head Office, recommending the 

termination of the Contract with AAPE for its continuous failure to fulfill its obligations 

under said Contract.  

 

11.53 On October 10, 2020, the Center posted in the PHILGEPS its Invitation to Bid for 

the procurement of the undelivered 30 heads of buffalo.  The Procurement was awarded to 

St. Ruiz Agro Farm Supply and General Merchandise, Laoag City on December 14, 2020 

while the NTP was issued on December 29, 2020 and conformed on the same day by the 

supplier. 

 

11.54 Moreover, the audit of expenses related to the above Program/Project, distribution 

of 164 bags of feeds costing ₱216,000.000 and red rockies of ₱1,650.00, totaling to 

₱217,650.00 was made to a Cooperative (Northern Ilocos Sur Agricultural Cooperative) 

which is not a legitimate/targeted beneficiary of the said supplies.  

 

11.55 The Management of PCC at MMSU commented that Northern Ilocos Sur 

Agricultural Cooperative was one of the beneficiaries chosen by the focal person identified 

by the funding agency of the ₱10M carabao project. The PC Center transferred 15 female 

buffaloes to this Cooperative.   

 

11.56 The Audit Team is of the stand that the above Cooperative is not a legitimate 

beneficiary since the buffaloes dispersed did not come from the fund granted under the 

CBIN. 
 

11.57 The Audit Team of PCC at MMSU recommended that Management (a) 

bestow to the Center autonomy in the procurement of its projects, goods and services 

for timely enjoyment and effective implementation of the program for the benefit of 

its clientele; and (b) ensure that the funds of the aforesaid Program/Project be utilized 

and spent exclusively for legitimate/targeted beneficiaries so as not to deprive them 

of the intended support and benefits under the Program.   
 

f. Delayed/unsubstantiated delivery of buffaloes- PCC at University of the Philippines – 
Los Baños (PCC at UPLB) 

 

11.58 As of December 31, 2020, the PCC had total obligations of ₱15,911,634.92 or 

86.87% of the total funds transferred of ₱18,317,435.75. Out of this, the amount of 

₱2,376,822.26 or 12.98% only was utilized for Travelling Expenses-Local, Fuel, Oil and

11.57 The breakdown of appropriation items and the corresponding amounts were 
indicated/provided upon receipt of cash subsidy from the PCC NHGP.  On August 10, 

October 23 and November 16, 2020, the OIC-Director of PCC at UPLB requested for the 

realignment of funds transferred to ensure the improvement of existing milk processing 

and marketing facilities under CBIN Albay and Palawan which were approved by the 

Executive Director of PCC-NHGP. 

 

11.58 Inquiry with the PCC at UPLB Management by the Audit Team assigned thereat 
disclosed that some component items of the CBIN project were procured at PCC NHGP 

while other items are to be procured through the assistance of UPLB.  

 

11.59 Considering the data on the foregoing table, the low percentage of utilization of 

funds could also be attributed to the delayed procurement of buffaloes, among others, due 

to termination of contract dated November 5, 2019 amounting to ₱5,699,500.00 for the 

Supply and Delivery of Crossbred/Purebred Buffaloes (100 Heads) PCC at UPLB.  

Moreover, the contract agreement was belatedly submitted contrary to Section 3.1.1 of 

COA Circular No. 2009-001, dated February 12, 2009.  

 



121 
 

11.59 The PCC at UPLB revealed that the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) of PCC 
NHGP conducted the bidding process concerning the procurement of female buffaloes for 

the project. Likewise, the award and contract for the said procurement were signed by the 

Executive Director of PCC NHGP being the Head of the Procuring Entity (HOPE).  

 

11.60 Nevertheless, the contract was terminated on August 26, 2020 based on the ground 
cited in the Verified Report dated August 17, 2020 submitted by the PCC at UPLB as the 

Implementing Unit finding that the Contractor had failed to deliver the buffaloes subject 

of the contract within the extension period granted by them. It was also stated that the delay 

in the delivery has prejudiced the PCC and has affected its timetable in implementing the 

CBIN project.  

 

11.61 The Blacklisting Order No. 1, Series of 2020 was issued by the OIC – Executive 
Director of PCC NHGP to the entity that failed to deliver the object of the contract. The 

said Order was sent through courier on November 11, 2020 with the owner/proprietor of 

the entity as the recipient. 

 

11.62 In view of the termination of the contract, the procurement for the Supply and 
Delivery of Crossbred Buffaloes for Palawan and Albay with an Approved Budget for the 

Contract (ABC) of ₱3,000,000.00 each were rebidded on October 6, 2020. The two 

Contract Agreements amounting to ₱2,990,000.00 each both dated October 22, 2020 were 

entered with the same supplier and belatedly submitted to the Audit Team on December 1, 

2020.  

 

11.63 Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001, dated February 12, 2009, provides 
that within five working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any 

of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and 

controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the 

documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished the 

Auditor of the agency concerned. 

 

11.64 Due to the COVID 19 pandemic, the delivery of buffaloes which were due within 
90 calendar days upon receipt of the Notice to Proceed on October 27, 2020 or until January 

25, 2021 was delayed. The request for 60-day extension of delivery or until March 26, 2021 

was approved by the OIC-Director on January 25, 2021. 

 

11.65 On the other hand, the list of intended farmer-beneficiaries of the said buffaloes in 
Palawan was not submitted to the Audit Team upon request. 

 

11.66 The Audit Team of PCC at UPLB recommended that Management (a) strictly 
enforce the delivery of buffaloes within the approved extension period given to the 

contractor; (b) submit the list of intended farmer-beneficiaries in Palawan of the said 

buffaloes; and (c) comply strictly with the prescribed period on the submission of 

copies of Purchase Orders and perfected contracts and their supporting documents 

pursuant to COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009.

Absence of OSG Clearance for private lawyer 

 

12.  The PCC NHGP did not secure a clearance from the Office of the Solicitor 

General (OSG) that his prior written conformity and acquiescence for the hiring of a 

private lawyer as technical consultant is not required, thus, not harmonized with the 

standard called for under Section 3 of the Revised Guidelines on the Deputation of 

Private Lawyers and Special Attorneys dated December 15, 2015. 

 

12.1 Section 3 of the Revised Guidelines on the Deputation of Private Lawyers and 

Special Attorneys issued by the Solicitor General on December 15, 2015 provides the 

following: 

 

In the hiring of private lawyers to act as technical consultants for the 

government or client agency concerned, the requisite prior written 

conformity and acquiescence of the Solicitor General need not be obtained: 

Provided however, That said technical consultant's services pertain 

exclusively and are limited to purely technical matters: Provided, further, 

That under the terms and conditions of the Proposed Contract of Service, 

such technical consultant is prohibited from rendering legal services to the 

government or client agency concerned. The term "legal services" shall mean 

any activity, in and out of court, that requires the application of law, legal 

procedure, knowledge, training and experience. The term shall also include 

giving notice or rendering any kind of service, which device or service 

requires the use in any degree of legal knowledge or skill:7 Provided, finally, 

That the government or client agency concerned shall secure a clearance 

from the Solicitor General that his prior written conformity and 

acquiescence for the hiring of such technical consultant is not required. 

(emphasis supplied) 

 

12.2 The Audit reveals that during CY 2020, the PCC National Headquarters and Gene 
Pool (NHGP) paid a total amount of ₱300,000.00 for the services of a Legal Consultant, 

as shown by the following disbursement vouchers (DVs): 

 
Check Date Check No. Particulars Amount 

6/15/2020 9920200812 Payment of honorarium for the 1st and 2nd quarter of 

FY 2020 

₱150,000.00 

10/12/2020 9920201381 Payment of honorarium for the 3rd quarter of FY 2020 75,000.00 

12/28/2020  Accounts Payable for the payment of honorarium for 

the 4th quarter of FY 2020 

75,000.00 

TOTAL   ₱300,000.00 

 

12.3 Review of the supporting documents revealed that the Contract of Services pertain 
to a one-year contract executed by the PCC NHGP and the Legal Consultant, subject to 

renewal for a similar period in the exigency of the service. It stated therein that the PCC 

decided to engage and retain the services of the Legal Consultant to act as adviser to the 

Office of the Executive Director and attend to various requirements and special projects 

and concerns requiring his expertise.  



123 
 

12.4 The said Legal Consultant was once designated as Acting Government Corporate 
Counsel but has already retired from active service, thus, currently considered a private 

lawyer.  

 

12.5 In an interview with the Accountant, she asserted that they were not familiar with 
the requirement on the deputation of a private lawyer to act as technical or legal consultant. 

Further verification revealed that the only attachments to the claims for Legal Services 

were the Contract and a certification of services rendered executed by the Legal Consultant 

himself.  

 

12.6 The absence of a clearance from the OSG that his prior written conformity and 
acquiescence for the hiring of such legal consultant is not required was not harmonized 

with the standard called for under Section 3 of the Revised Guidelines on the Deputation 

of Private Lawyers and Special Attorneys dated December 15, 2015, supra. 

 

12.7 Consequently, the Audit Team rendered doubt on the propriety of the above 
disbursements amounting to ₱300,000.00. 

 

12.8 We recommended and the OIC - Executive Director agreed to instruct the 
personnel concerned from the Administrative and Financial Management Division to 

secure a clearance from the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) that his prior 

written conformity and acquiescence for the hiring of a private lawyer to act as 

technical consultant is not required pursuant to Section 3 of the Revised Guidelines 

on the Deputation of Private Lawyers and Special Attorneys dated December 15, 

2015. 
 

 
Unsound accounting practices   

 

13.  Several accounting practices in the operation of different Centers of the PCC 

were unsound and contrary to various laws, rules and regulations set forth under 

Presidential Decree (P.D.) No.1445, International Public State Accounting Standards 

(IPSAS) 1 and COA Circular No. 12-001. 
 

13.1 In the CY 2020 audit of operations of different PC Centers, the following unsound 

practices and deficiencies were noted: 

 

(a) Unrecognized Prior Year’s Expenses (PCC at CLSU)- ₱1.26 Million 
 

13.2 Prior year’s expenses totaling to ₱1,259,654.93 were charged against current year’s 
appropriations contrary to Section 119 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, thus, not in 

consonance with the accrual basis of accounting as prescribed by International Public 

Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1- Presentation of Financial Statements. 

 



124 
 

13.3 Section 119 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 states that all lawful 

expenditures and obligations incurred during the year shall be taken up in the accounts of 

that year.  

 

13.4 Relatedly, the basic principle of the accrual basis of accounting as per International 

Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1- Presentation of Financial Statements 

provides that expenses should be recorded in the period these were incurred. 

 

13.5 Verification of the expenditures of the Philippine Carabao Center (PCC) at CLSU 

for CY 2020 showed that the Center paid a total of ₱1,259,654.93 for various expenses 

which were incurred in CY 2019 but were charged against the appropriation of the current 

year. Verification disclosed that these expenses were not obligated at the end of CY 2019 

and no provision for Accounts Payable was made for the payment of prior year’s 

obligations in the current year’s budget, as summarized below and detailed in Appendix 

O: 

 
Expenditure classification Total Amount 

Office Supplies Expenses ₱129,939.00 

Other Supplies and Materials Expenses 578,783.93 

Agricultural and Marine Supplies Expenses 268,392.00 

Other General Services 10,800.00 

Training Expenses 93,840.00 

Representation Expenses 8,750.00 

Repairs and Maintenance- Transportation Equipment 166,950.00 

Repairs and Maintenance- Machinery and Equipment 2,200.00 

Grand Total ₱1,259,654.93 

 

13.6 Inquiry with the Accountant and the Bookkeeper revealed that the aforementioned 

expenses were not obligated at the end of CY 2019 due to non-submission of the required 

documents by the claimants to the Accounting Unit before the year-end closing of the 

books.  

 

13.7 Prior year’s obligations should not be charged against the appropriations of the 

current year unless a supplemental budget has been enacted for that purpose. As such, 

payments of previous year’s expenses which were not duly obligated are deemed irregular 

disbursements, overstating CY 2020 expenses by ₱1,259,654.93. Inversely, Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) account was understated by the same amount.  

 

13.8 We recommended that the Center Director instruct the Accounting Unit to (a) 

ensure that appropriations are available before obligations are incurred and that all 

expenditures which could not be paid in the year these were incurred are recognized 

as Accounts Payable before the close of the year; and (b) comply with the accrual 

basis of accounting for complete reporting of all financial transactions in the financial 

statements. 
 

 

 

 



125 
 

(b) Incomplete Documentation of Disbursements (PCC at DMMMSU) - ₱7,668,741.80 
 

13.9 Disbursements aggregating to ₱7,668,741.80 were not supported with complete 

documentation, contrary to Section 4(6) of P.D. No. 1445 and applicable provisions of 

COA Circular No. 2012-001, casting doubt on their validity and propriety. 

  

13.10 Section 4(6) of P.D. No. 1445 provides that “Claims against government funds shall 

be supported with complete documentation”. This is provided for in order to establish the 

validity of the claims. Also, COA Circular No. 2012-001 prescribes the Revised 

Documentary Requirements for Common Government Transactions. 

 

13.11 The post-audit of disbursements showed 40 transactions aggregating to 

₱7,668,741.80 which were not supported with complete documentary requirements, details 

of which are shown in Appendix P.   

 

13.12 Considering that the propriety of the transactions and their conformity with laws, 

rules and regulations largely depends on the completeness of documentary requirements, 

it is therefore very important that these are complete. Otherwise, the propriety of the 

disbursements is doubtful. 

 

13.13 The absence of complete supporting documents cast doubt on the validity and 

propriety of the transactions. 

 

13.14 We recommended that Management require the Accountant to cause the 

submission of the lacking documents and, henceforth, review and verify the 

completeness and validity of the documentary requirements prior to payment of 

expenses in order to ensure the validity and propriety of the Center’s disbursements. 

 

 

Compliance with Tax Laws and Regulations 

 

14.  Remittance of taxes of ₱27,730,563.02 withheld from the payments of goods and 

services to suppliers/contractors, and compensation/honoraria of employees was effected 

in CY 2020 in consonance with the provisions under BIR Revenue Regulations Nos. 2-

98, 10-2008, and 1-2013 dated April 17, 1998, July 8, 2008, and January 23, 2013, 

respectively, thereby, contributing to the financing of various public services of the 

government. However, under remittance was observed in the consolidated schedule of 

taxes withheld and the corresponding remittances.    

 

14.1 Section 5.116 (B) of Revenue Regulations No. 2-98 dated April 17, 1998 mandates 

any government office or agency to deduct and withhold taxes due from the payments it 

made and to remit the same to the Authorized Agent Bank located within the Revenue 

District Office (RDO) having jurisdiction over the place where the government office is 

located. 

 



126 
 

14.2 BIR Revenue   Regulations   No. 10-2008   dated   July 8, 2008 further states that 

all government offices are constituted as withholding agents for purposes of the creditable 

tax required to be withheld on income payments from compensation, contractors, suppliers 

of goods and services. As withholding agents, they are primarily liable for the payment of 

the taxes to the National Treasury through the BIR. 

 

14.3 Relatedly, Revenue Regulations No. 1-2013 dated January 23, 2013 provides that 

filing of returns and payment of taxes shall be made on or before the 10th day following the 

month in which withholding was made, except for taxes withheld for the month of 

December of each year, which shall be filed on or before January 15 of the succeeding 

year.  

 

14.4 Based on the validated financial statements for CY 2020, PCC has been regularly 

withholding and remitting taxes in accordance with the manner and timelines set forth in 

the aforementioned provisions. However, the schedule of taxes withheld and remitted 

during the year disclosed that the taxes withheld were not remitted in full as presented 

hereunder.

14.5 The balance as of December 31, 2020 was remitted in January 2021. 

 

14.6 We recommended that the OIC - Executive Director instruct the (a) 

Accountants/Bookkeepers of the Centers (i) to continuously adhere to the revenue 

regulations on the withholding and timely remittance of taxes to the BIR; and (ii) to 

keep the recording in the RCI and eNGAS updated to ensure full remittance of taxes 

withheld.  

 

 



127 
 

Compliance with GSIS Laws 

 

15.  The PCC NHGP complied with R.A. No. 8291 or the Government Service 

Insurance System Law on the withholding of GSIS monthly premiums/contributions for 

retirement and life insurance policies (RLIP) from employees’ compensation and in the 

remittance thereof together with the government share and loan amortizations within 

the prescribed period, thus, allowing ready access of members to benefits and privileges 

provided by the System. 

 

15.1 From January 1 to December 31, 2020, the appropriate GSIS premiums and loan 

amortizations were deducted from the salaries of the employees of the PCC NHGP.  Our 

analysis also showed that the same, together with the government share, were remitted to 

the GSIS within the prescribed period, in satisfactory compliance with R.A. No. 8291, the 

GSIS Law, which mandates, among others, the employer to deduct and remit to the GSIS 

member contributions and loan amortizations in amounts and timelines prescribed.

15.3 As gathered in the foregoing table, the total amount of ₱380,600.74 was remitted 
in January 2021 pursuant to the provisions under the aforementioned Republic Act. 

 

15.4 We recommended that the OIC - Executive Director instruct the Accounting 
Unit of all PC Centers to continue to be compliant with the deduction of GSIS 

premium contributions and the remittance thereof including the government share 

within the prescribed period. 

 

 

 

 



128 
 

Compliance with R.A. No.  9679 otherwise known as the HDMF Law 

16.  The contributions and other amounts due to Pagtutulungan sa kinabukasan: 

Ikaw, Bangko, Industriya at Gobyerno (Pag-IBIG) deducted from the compensation of 

employees together with the government share thereto were fully remitted to the Pag-

IBIG within the prescribed period pursuant to Implementing Rules and Regulations 

(IRR) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9679, otherwise known as the Home Development 

Mutual Fund (HDMF) Law of 2009, thus, assuring members of unhampered benefits 

and privileges therefrom.  
 

16.1 Verification of the General Ledger (GL) of the Due to Pag-IBIG Account disclosed 

that contributions and loan repayments deducted from payrolls and the remittance thereof 

complied with Rule VII, Sections 2 and 3 of the IRR of Republic Act (R.A. No. 9679, the 

HDMF Law, which mandates, among others, the collection and remittance of Pag-IBIG 

contributions and loan amortizations.  

 

16.2 Audit of payrolls and remittances of HDMF premium contributions for CY 2019 

disclosed that the government share of HDMF monthly contributions for each employee 

was properly accounted and timely remittance thereof was made thereby leaving a year-

end balance of ₱109,663.08 which was then remitted in the ensuing year, details of which 

are shown hereunder.

16.3 The foregoing table shows substantial compliance by the PCC with the HDMF Law 
although it also shows that most often the monthly withheld contributions were not fully 

remitted on the following month.  Thus, the remaining unremitted as of December 31, 2020 

in the amount of ₱57,582.62 was remitted in January 2021. 

 

16.4  We recommended that the Executive Director instruct the Accounting Unit of 

all PC Centers to continually adhere to the timely remittance thereof including the 



129 
 

government share within the prescribed period. We also recommended that the whole 

amount of withheld monthly contributions be remitted intact.   
 
 

Status of Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges and Settlements  

  

17. The PCC NHGP and five PC Centers reported no unsettled balances of audit 
suspensions, disallowances and charges as of December 31, 2020. However, the PC 

Center at VSU, LCSF and MLPC had outstanding suspensions of ₱11,231,203.04 and 

audit disallowances of ₱57,659.67 as reflected in the submitted Management Letters 

(MLs) and Status of Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges (SASDC).  

 

17.1 COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 was issued to prescribe the 
Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) which superseded COA 

Circular No. 94-001 and COA Memorandum No. 2002-053 dated January 20, 1994 and 

August 26, 2002, respectively. 

 

17.2 Section 5.1 of this Circular provides that “Settlement of accounts is the process of 
determining the balance of the account of an accountable officer, through an audit and 

examination thereof, to verify the total debits and total credits that may be allowed. Such 

balance represents the disallowance or charge which shall be his accountability. A 

suspension may likewise result from such audits as provided in these Rules.” 

 

17.3 It was provided further in Section 5.4 that “An audit suspension or 
disallowance/charge shall be settled by the persons responsible or liable therefor through 

compliance with the requirements, or payments/restitution or by any of the modes of 

extinguishment of obligation provided by law, respectively. A Notice of Settlement of 

Suspension/Disallowance/Charge (NSSDC) shall be issued for such settlement. 

 

 15.2 The PCC NHGP and PC Centers at CLSU, CSU, DMMMSU, MMMSU and UPLB 

reported no outstanding balances of Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges as of year-

end. However, the aggregate balances of Suspensions, and Disallowances for PC Centers 

at VSU and LCSF were reflected in their respective Management Letter (ML) while the 

PCC at Mindanao Livestock Production Center (MLPC) provided a copy of the Status of 

Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges and Settlements (SASDC). Presented below are 

the details.
