AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 
The auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial

in the course of the audit which is stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report and discussed in 
detail under Part II of the report.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
Financial and Compliance 
 
1. The reported PPE net book value of ₱209,659,598.04 could not be relied upon due to 

non-maintenance of PPE Ledger Cards (PPELC) and Property Cards (PC), and 
continuous failure of the Management to conduct a complete physical count.  Moreover, 
various unserviceable properties were not disposed and dropped from the books 
thereby overstating the PPE accounts and affect the fair presentation of the accounts in 
the financial statements.  
 
We reiterate previous years’ audit recommendation that management: a. Strictly 
require the accounting and supply officer to prepare, maintain and reconcile accounting and 
property records in accordance with GAM; b. Require the inventory committee to conduct 
periodic physical count of PPE and reconcile with property and accounting records and 
submit to COA the prescribed RPCPPE form in accordance with GAM; c.Instruct the supply 
officer to prepare the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Properties and  
require the Disposal Committee  to comply and expedite the appraisal and undertake disposal 
of the unserviceable properties which are beyond economic repair to prevent further 
deterioration and loss of value of the assets as mandated under Section 79 of PD1445. 

 
2. Non-compliance to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Circular Letter 

No. 2013-16 dated December 23, 2013 prescribing the adoption of Expanded Modified 
Direct Payment Scheme (ExMDPS) for the settlement of Accounts Payable (A/P) due to 
creditors/payees thus, defeating the purpose of a more transparent, accountable and 
efficient payment system. 

 
We recommended that management: a.) Adopt ExMDPS for payment of A/Ps Due 
Creditors/Payees and refrain from using check for disbursement except those that were 
excluded from its implementation per DBM Circular Letter Nos. 2013-16A and 2013-16B 
dated February 6, 2014 and February 25, 2014, respectively; b.) Use LDDAP-ADA which 
shall be considered an accountable form in processing payment of A/Ps under ExMDPS; and 
c.) Encourage or advise their creditors/payees to open a Current or Savings Account (CA/SA) 
with any branch of their authorized Modified Disbursement System, Government Servicing 
Banks (MDS-GSB) and if not feasible or difficult for some creditors/payees due to company 
policy, the Management shall be advised to open an account with any banks included in the 
List of Participating Banks in Electronic Peso Clearing System (EPCS). 

 
3. Various goods and services were procured on reimbursement basis by CFCST 

personnel instead of direct payment to suppliers, dealers, or creditors which does not 
conform with Section 93 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 thus, depriving the Bureau of 
Internal Revenue (BIR) of taxes due thereon as required by Section 114 of the National 
Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997 as amended by Section 12 of Republic Act No. 
9337 of 2005.  

 
We recommended that management: a.) Refrain from procuring goods and services on 
reimbursement basis to prevent the non-withholding of creditable value-added tax due to the 
Bureau of Internal Revenue; b.) Set-up Petty Cash Fund that is deemed appropriate for the 
payment of petty operating expenses and comply with requirements on the granting, 



iv 
 

utilization and liquidation of such fund; and c.) Adhere strictly to the provisions of R.A. 9184 
by resorting to any of the alternative modes of procurement. 
  

4. Some claims against agency regular funds amounting to ₱5,551,623.00 were made 
despite inadequate documentation contrary to Section 4 of PD 1445, COA Circular No. 
2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, thereby casting doubt as to their validity and propriety. 

 
We recommended that Management to: a.) Require the Agency Accountant to provide a 
checklist of required supporting documents for every transaction subject for disbursement to 
facilitate its processing and ensure that all claims are properly supported with complete 
documents pursuant to Section 4(6) of PD 1445; b.) Submit and comply all the necessary 
documents which were noted in audit as lacking or insufficient in consonance with COA 
Circular 2012-001; and c.) Ensure that measures to strengthen the internal control are adopted 
or in place so that no claims shall be paid without complete supporting documents. 
 

5. Delay in the completion of the Computerized Enrollment System Software Program of 
CFCST contravened the Contract Agreement and Section 68 of Implementing Rules 
and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9184 thus, deprived the end-users/beneficiaries of the 
immediate use and benefits that could be derived thereon and may result to the 
accumulation of liquidated damages. 
 
We recommended that management compel the Software Provider to finish and complete 
immediately the installation of the Software Program-Enrollment System for the immediate 
use of the end-users.  Considering the lapse of time and delay in the completion of the project, 
liquidated damages should be imposed against the Provider in accordance with Section 68 of 
the Revised IRR of RA 9184. 

 
COMPLIANCE WITH TAX LAWS 
 
 From the taxes withheld by the CFCST from employees’ compensation and from 
suppliers and creditors totaling ₱10.78M for the CY 2020, the amount of ₱8.83M was remitted to 
the BIR leaving an unremitted balance of ₱2.15M.  The ending balance represented taxes 
withheld in CY 2020.  Details are discussed in Part II of this report. 
 
STATUS OF SETTLEMENT OF AUDIT SUSPENSIONS AND DISALLOWANCES 
 

No Audit Suspensions or Disallowances were issued and reported as of December 31, 
2019.  
 
STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION BY THE AUDITEE’S OF PRIOR YEAR’S AUDIT 
RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
Of the fifteen prior year’s audit recommendations contained in prior years’ Annual Audit 

Report, the status of implementation is as follows:

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
 
ENGR. ALI K. DILANGALEN, Ph. D. 
College President 
Cotabato Foundation College of Science and Technology 
Doroluman, Arakan, Cotabato 
 
 
Qualified Opinion  
 
We have audited the financial statements of the Cotabato Foundation College of Science and 
Technology (CFCST), Doroluman, Arakan, Cotabato, which comprise the Statement of 
Financial Position as at December 31, 2020, and the Statement of Financial Performance, 
Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity, Statement of Cash Flows and Statement of 
Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts for the year then ended, and Notes to the Financial 
Statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. 
 
In our opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion 
section of our report, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material 
respects, the Financial Position of the CFCST as at December 31, 2020, and its Financial 
Performance, Changes in Net Assets/Equity, Cash Flows, and Comparison of Budget and Actual 
Amounts for the year then ended in accordance with the International Public Sector Accounting 
Standards (IPSASs).  
 
Basis for Qualified Opinion 
 
As discussed in Part II – Observation and Recommendations portion of the Annual Audit Report, 
exception is made on the year-end balance of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts at 
book value of ₱209.66M as of December 31, 2020 cannot be relied upon due to non-maintenance 
and non-reconciliation of property and accounting records; failure to complete the physical count 
of properties; various unserviceable properties were not yet disposed and dropped from the book 
thereby overstating the PPE account.  

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions 
(ISSAIs).  Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.  We are 
independent of CFCST in accordance with the Revised Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards 
for Commission on Audit Officials and Employees (Code of Ethics) together with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the Philippines, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the 
Code of Ethics.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide basis for our opinion.

The Modified Obligation System is used to record allotments received and 
obligations incurred.  Separate registries are maintained to control allotments and 
obligations for each class of allotment. 
 
Petty Cash Fund (PCF) account is maintained under the Imprest System. All 
replenishments are charged to the expense account.  The PCF is not used to 
purchase regular inventory items for stock.      
 
Property, Plant and Equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. 
 
The Straight-Line Method of depreciation is used in depreciating the Property, 
Plant and Equipment with estimated useful lives ranging from five to fifty years.  
A residual value, computed at ten percent of the cost of asset is set and 
depreciation starts on the second month after purchase. 
 
Payable accounts are recognized and recorded in the books of accounts only upon 
acceptance of the goods/ inventory/other assets and rendition of services to the 
agency. 
 
Accounts were reclassified to conform to the Chart of Accounts prescribed under 
the Unified Account Code Structure (UACS) which was implemented effective

Nine Hundred Twenty Thousand Six Hundred Ninety-Two Pesos and Forty-Two 
Centavos (₱98,920,692.42).

PART II - AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

A. Financial and Compliance  
 
Audit Observation No. 1 
 
The reported PPE net book value of ₱209,659,598.04 could not be relied upon due to 
non-maintenance of PPE Ledger Cards (PPELC) and Property Cards (PC), and 
continuous failure of the Management to conduct a complete physical count contrary 
to Sections 20 and 42, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.  Moreover, various 
unserviceable properties were not disposed and dropped from the books thereby 
overstating the PPE accounts and affect the fair presentation of the accounts in the 
financial statements.  

 
Sections 20 and 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM Volume I, provides that: 

 
“Deliveries of PPE shall be recorded immediately in the Property 
Card (PC) maintained by the Supply and/or Property 
Division/Unit on the basis of the Inspection and Acceptance 
Receipt (IAR) and other supporting documents.  The IAR and 
other supporting documents shall be forwarded to the Accounting 
Division/Unit for the recording of deliveries in the books of 
accounts through JEV and in the Property, Plant and Equipment 
Ledger Card (PPELC).  Based on the IAR and other supporting 
documents, the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit shall 
prepare the DV and submit to the Accounting Division/Unit for 
the processing of payment.” 

 
“The Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each 
category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc.  
The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, 
description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, 
impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset.  
For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall 
likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the 
receipt and disposition of the same.  The balance per PC shall be 
reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting 
Division/Unit.  They shall also be reconciled with other property 
records like PAR.” 

 
Moreover, Section 38, Chapter 10 also of the GAM for NGAs Volume I provides 

that entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and 
presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) 
as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later 
than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered 



18 
 

during physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper 
accounting/recording.  
 

The completeness and accuracy of the submitted Report on the Physical Count of 
Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) could not be determined due to non-
updating/maintenance of Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Cards (PPELCs) by the 
Accounting Section and/or Property Cards (PCs) by the Supply Section. 
 

The maintenance of updated PPELCS and PCs serves as a control mechanism on the 
integrity of property custodianship.  Failure to update the PPELCs and PCs will result in the 
difficulty in monitoring the existence and condition of the property.  Moreover, the report on 
the physical count of PPE shall be reconciled with the PCs every year and any discrepancy 
should be immediately verified and adjusted.    

 
  As of December 31, 2020, Management’s financial statements showed PPE accounts 
valued at ₱308,699,940.46 which consists of the following: 
 

Account Title Cost Accumulated Depreciation Net Book Value 

Land ₱3,049,640.60 - ₱3,049,640.60 
Infrastructure Assets 60,099,241.84 ₱10,319,575.03 49,779,666.81 
Building and Other Structures 194,489,898.49 59,275,294.33 135,214,604.16 
Machineries and Equipment 41,199,692.16 22,399,793.82 18,799,898.34 
Transportation Equipment 7,735,319.12 6,364,836.07 1,370,483.05 
Furniture, Fixtures and Books 1,457,555.00 275,240.54 1,182,314.46 
Other Property, Plant and 
Equipment 668,593.25 405,602.63 262,990.62 

TOTAL ₱308,699,940.46  ₱99,040,342.42  ₱209,659,598.04  
 
 Inventory taking is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property 
custodianship.  The physical stock-taking of property, plant and equipment serves as a basis 
for preparing accounting reports.  It must be done annually as at December 31 of each year 
and must be submitted to COA not later than January 31 of the following year which the 
agency failed to do so.   
 

Inquiry with the property officer showed that an Inventory Committee was created 
but the actual physical and inventory count of all PPEs was not completely conducted by the 
said committee.  

 
Various unserviceable office equipment were not reported and neither Inventory and 

Inspection Report was prepared by the Property Officer nor action was taken by the 
Disposal Committee, thus disposal could not be facilitated as required under Section 79 of 
PD 1445. 
 



19 
 

These unserviceable properties remained in the books thereby overstating the PPE 
account.  Moreover, further delays in the disposal of these unserviceable properties were 
exposing them to further deterioration and reduce economic value thereby resulting in losses 
and depriving the College of additional revenue from the sale thereof. 

 
The above observations is partly a reiteration of the CY 2017 to CY 2019 Annual 

Audit Reports and these affect the determination of the accuracy and reliability of the PPE 
accounts.  The management practice of non-conducting the inventory count of all PPEs is a 
clear manifestation of continuous disregard of audit recommendations to address various 
lapses in the handling, recording and monitoring of the College’s properties. 

 
Management has acknowledged the deficiencies and is aware that the 

implementation of the audit recommendations was not observed  through the years.  It was 
communicated to the team that  management was able to conduct complete physical 
inventory count for CY-2020 however, this was completed after the preparation of the audit 
observation.  Management is also aware that property cards and ledger cards are not being 
maintained and expressed their commitment to adhere to the recommendations of the audit 
team. 
 
Recommendation - 
 

We reiterate previous years’ audit recommendation that management: 
 

a. Strictly require the accounting and supply officer to prepare, maintain and 
reconcile accounting and property records in accordance with GAM; 

 
b. Require the inventory committee to conduct periodic physical count of PPE and 

reconcile with property and accounting records and submit to COA the 
prescribed RPCPPE form in accordance with GAM; 

 
c. Instruct the supply officer to prepare the Inventory and Inspection Report of 

Unserviceable Properties and  require the Disposal Committee  to comply and 
expedite the appraisal and undertake disposal of the unserviceable properties 
which are beyond economic repair to prevent further deterioration and loss of 
value of the assets as mandated under Section 79 of PD1445; and 

 
d. Instruct the accountant to take up the necessary adjustments on the discrepancy 

noted for an accurate and fair financial presentation. 
 
 
Audit Observation No. 2 
 
Non-compliance to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Circular 
Letter No. 2013-16 dated December 23, 2013 prescribing the adoption of Expanded 
Modified Direct Payment Scheme (ExMDPS) for the settlement of Accounts Payable 
(A/P) due to creditors/payees thus, defeating the purpose of a more transparent, 
accountable and efficient payment system.  



20 
 

 
DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-16 dated December 23, 2013 prescribes the 

guidelines on the implementation of the ExMDPS for A/P due Creditors/Payees for all 
National Government Agencies (NGAs). 
 

Section 5.9 of the DBM Circular Letter prescribes the payment procedure thru 
ExMDPS, whereby the Modified Disbursement System, Government Servicing Banks 
(MDS-GSB) shall pay the creditors/payees listed in the List of Due and Demandable A/P 
with Advice to Debit Account (LDDAP-ADA) not later than 48 hours but not earlier than 24 
hours upon receipt of the said document from the NGA/Operating Unit (OU), thru: 
 

a. Direct credit to the creditor’s current/savings/ATM account (CA/SA/ATM) 
maintained with the MDS-GSB; or 

b. Bank transfer, if creditors’ account is maintained outside agency’s MDS-GSB, where 
corresponding bank charges shall be borne by the creditor/payee concerned. 
 
Paragraph 6.2 of the circular letter also indicated that starting January 1, 2014, A/Ps 

due to creditors/payees of all NGAs/OUs shall be settled thru ExMDPS chargeable against 
the Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) credited under the regular MDS sub-account 
(Common Fund) of the NGA.  It was further deferred to March 1, 2014 pursuant to Circular 
Letter No. 2013-12 dated November 21, 2013, that the crediting NGAs/OUs’ regular MDS 
sub-accounts for any month of a given quarter, shall be valid until the last working day of 
the 3rd month of that quarter. 
 
 Paragraph 5.5 states that LDDAP-ADA refers to “accountable form integrating the 
ADA with LDDAP which is a list reflecting the names of creditors/payees to be paid by the 
NGA/OU and the corresponding amounts of their unpaid claims, duly certified and approved 
by the heads of the accounting unit and the agency or authorized official.”   
 

Section 6.4 of said Circular Letter provides that to facilitate the use of ExMDPS, all 
NGAs/OUs shall encourage or advice their creditors/payees to open a Current or Savings 
Account (CA/SA) with any branch of their authorized MDS-GSB.  For creditors/payees, 
where opening of a CA/SA with MDS-GSB is not feasible or difficult due to company 
policy, they shall be advised to open an account with any of the banks included in the List of 
Participating Banks in the Electronic Peso Clearing System (EPCS). 

Furthermore, Section 7.1.1 obliges NGAs/OUs to require their creditors to furnish 
them with their respective account numbers and bank branches to which amounts for release 
shall be credited.  

Upon inquiry, it was learned that as of CY-2020, Management presently uses two 
schemes for payment of Accounts Payables, namely:  

 
1. Payment through issuance of MDS checks; and 
2. Via bank debit system through issuance of Advice to Debit Account (ADA) 



21 
 

The foregoing deficiency is contrary to the provisions of DBM Circular Letter No. 
2013-16 thereby defeating government objective of adopting uniform procedures in the 
payment of current year and prior year’s A/Ps due to all creditors/payees of all National 
Government Agencies.  

Management is aware of such non-compliance and in its reply communicated that 
their previous Accountant did not see it necessary to adopt the ExMDPS and that no 
Accounts Payable were outstanding in the books hence, the resulting non-compliance. 
Nonetheless, management still expressed their willingness to coordinate with their 
respective MDS-GSB, to comply with the aforementioned Circular.  The Audit Team 
maintain its position that it is imperative for the management to implement the said payment 
scheme as prescribed by DBM in its Circular Letter for a more transparent and efficient 
payment system.     
 
Recommendations:  
 

We recommended that management: 
 

1. Adopt ExMDPS for payment of A/Ps Due Creditors/Payees and refrain from using 
check for disbursement except those that were excluded from its implementation per 
DBM Circular Letter Nos. 2013-16A and 2013-16B dated February 6, 2014 and 
February 25, 2014, respectively; 

 
2. Use LDDAP-ADA which shall be considered an accountable form in processing 

payment of A/Ps under ExMDPS; 
 

3. Encourage or advise their creditors/payees to open a Current or Savings Account 
(CA/SA) with any branch of their authorized Modified Disbursement System, 
Government Servicing Banks (MDS-GSB) and if not feasible or difficult for some 
creditors/payees due to company policy, the Management shall be advised to open an 
account with any banks included in the List of Participating Banks in Electronic Peso 
Clearing System (EPCS). 

 
 
 
Audit Observation No. 2 
 
Various goods and services were procured on reimbursement basis by CFCST 
personnel instead of direct payment to suppliers, dealers, or creditors which does not 
conform with Section 93 of Presidential Decree No. 1445, thus, depriving the Bureau of 
Internal Revenue (BIR) of taxes due thereon as required by Section 114 of the National 
Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997 as amended by Section 12 of Republic Act No. 
9337 of 2005. 
 

Section 93 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 states that “Warrant chargeable to 
revenue or trust funds of the National Government or checks drawn against the treasury 



22 
 

checking account for agencies maintained in any government depository shall be payable to 
either directly to the creditor or whom the money is due or to a disbursing officer for official 
disbursement.” 
 

Likewise, payments were made thru reimbursement instead of direct payment to 
suppliers resulting in (a) non-withholding of applicable taxes due the government; and (b) 
non-assurance that the most advantageous prices from such purchases were obtained. 
 

Further, Section 12 of R.A. 9337 of 2005 dated May 24, 2005, with regard 
to Withholding of Creditable Value-Added Tax, provides that “The Government or any of 
its political subdivisions, instrumentalities or agencies, including government-owned or 
controlled corporations (GOCCs) shall, before making payment on account of each purchase 
of goods and services which are subject to the value-added tax imposed in Sections 106 and 
108 of this Code, deduct and withhold a final value-added tax at the rate of five percent 
(5%) of the gross payment thereof...” 
 

Audit of disbursements covering the period January to June, 2020 for Fund 101 and 
January to August, 2020 for 161, as per submitted documents to the auditor’s office, showed 
that purchases of goods and services amounting to ₱634,980.16 were made through 
reimbursements by CFCST personnel instead of a direct payment to the suppliers.   
 

Notwithstanding the foregoing regulations, goods and services were procured thru 
reimbursement by personnel with amounts ranging from ₱2,110.50 to ₱90,000.00.  
Consequently, the taxes that should have been imposed on these procurements were not 
withheld.  In effect, the government was deprived from collecting the taxes due on the 
above-mentioned transactions.  
 

Inquiry with the concerned agency officials as to the reason/s of frequent 
reimbursements indicated that the goods and services purchased were urgently needed and 
that no revolving fund is presently maintained so, they resorted to that mode of procurement. 
 

This practice is contrary to Section 93 of Presidential Decree 1445 as quoted above 
and also with Section 114 of the National Revenue Code of 1997 as amended by Section 12 
of Republic Act No. 9337 of 2005 thus, depriving the Bureau of Internal Revenue of taxes 
due thereon.  
 

This reimbursement mode of procurement, if continuously allowed and practiced 
could be subject to abuse and contravenes the above-stated regulations. 
 

Management acknowledged the deficiency pointed out and expressed its 
commitment to minimize, if not, stop such purchases and firmly agreed in the establishment 
of additional petty cash funds for offices in need to prevent purchases through 
reimbursements basis. 

 
Recommendations: 
 

1. Refrain from procuring goods and services on reimbursement basis to prevent the non-
withholding of creditable value-added tax due to the Bureau of Internal Revenue; and 

 



23 
 

2. Set-up Petty Cash Fund that is deemed appropriate for the payment of petty operating 
expenses and comply with requirements on the granting, utilization and liquidation of 
such fund;  

 
3. Adhere strictly to the provisions of R.A. 9184 by resorting to any of the alternative 

modes of procurement.  
 
 

Audit Observation No. 3 
 

Several Property Plant and Equipment (PPE) of CFCST were not adequately insured 
with the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) as mandated under Republic 
Act No. 656 or the Property Insurance Law, thus posing risk of loss and not being 
indemnified for any damage due to fire, earthquake or other force majeure.  Further, 
the Property Insurance Form (PIF) was not submitted to the concerned offices as 
provided in COA Circular 2018-002. 
 
  All heads of national agencies, Local Government Units (LGUs), and Government-
Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) shall be responsible for the preparation and 
submission of inventory of all insurable physical assets using the required format by COA 
Circular 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018, Re: Guidelines prescribing the Submission of the 
PIF as for the assessment of general insurance coverage over all insurable assets, properties 
and interests of the government with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the GSIS. 
 
  A review of the paid insurance vouchers disclosed that management did not 
adequately insure their properties except motor vehicles as of December 31, 2020.  
 
  The Statement of Financial Position showed a total book value of ₱237,815,738.90 
for properties that should have been insured with the GIF of GSIS, hence, exposing these 
properties to unnecessary risk of not being indemnified for any damage or loss due to any 
fortuitous events such as fire, earthquake, typhoon and/or flood.  Details provided as 
follows: 
 

Account Title Amount 
Buildings  ₱14,468,184.52

TOTAL ₱237,815,738.90 

 
  Item 5(e) of the Circular requires the Head of the Government Agency to direct the 
concerned official under his/her supervision to submit the consolidated PIF to the offices of 
the GIF-GSIS and COA Auditors not later than April 30 of each year. 
 
  The non-compliance of this regulation denies the government adequate and reliable 
protection against loss of or damages to properties and assets due to fire, earthquake or other 
fortuitous events. 

 
  Management acknowledged the deficiency and directed the General Service Officer 
to prepare and accomplish the Property Insurance Forms for concerned offices. 

 
Recommendation: 
 
  We recommended that management direct General Services Officer to prepare and 
accomplish the Property Insurance Form and submit to the concerned government offices.  
Insure any insurable properties, assets and interests with the Government Insurance Fund as 
administered by GSIS. 
 
Audit Observation No. 4 
 
Some claims against agency regular funds amounting to ₱5,551,623.00 were made 
despite inadequate documentation contrary to Section 4 of PD 1445, COA Circular No. 
2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, thereby casting doubt as to their validity and propriety. 
 

Section 4(6) of PD 1445 provides the fundamental principles that will govern the 
financial transactions and operations of any government agency that claims against 
government funds shall be supported with complete documentation. 

 
Section 46 of PD 1177 also states that “…. No obligation shall be certified to 

accounts payable unless the obligation is founded on a valid claim that is properly supported 
by sufficient evidence and unless there is proper authority for its incurrence. Any 
certification for a non-existent or fictitious obligation and/or creditor shall be considered 
void….” 
 

COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, prescribes the guidelines and 
documentary requirements for common government transactions and should be firmly 
observed by the Management. 
 



25 
 

Post-audit of transactions for CY-2020 showed that some disbursement vouchers 
(DVs) were processed and paid from the regular funds even with incomplete/improper 
supporting documents as required under the aforementioned COA circular.   
 

Some transactions lacked documents such as Purchase Orders, Request for 
Quotations (RFQ), Abstract of Bids, BIR Forms 2306 and 2307, Payroll, Daily Time Record 
(DTR), incomplete signatories of authorized officials, and other documentary requisites for 
common government transactions. 

 
Inquiry with the accounting personnel disclosed that they thought that the 

attachments were already sufficient and that they’re not so familiar with the other necessary 
supporting papers.  The resulting deficiencies are attributable to inadequate internal control 
and lapses in disbursement procedures which may lead to doubtful validity and propriety of 
disbursements.  

 
The non-submission of these lacking supporting documents is not in consonance 

with the above-cited laws and rules and may lead to the issuance of Notice of Suspension on 
these transactions.  

 
Management acknowledged this deficiency and assured the audit team that they will 

comply and submit the lacking documents noted. In addition, management will provide a 
checklist of required supporting documents for every transaction, going forward, to ensure 
the completeness of supporting documents attached.  
 
Recommendations:  
 

We recommended that management: 
  

1. Require the Agency Accountant to provide a checklist of required supporting 
documents for every transaction subject for disbursement to facilitate its processing 
and ensure that all claims are properly supported with complete documents 
pursuant to Section 4(6) of PD 1445; 

 
2.  Submit and comply all the necessary documents which were noted in audit as 

lacking or insufficient in consonance with COA Circular 2012-001; 
 

3.  Ensure that measures to strengthen the internal control are adopted or in place so 
that no claims shall be paid without complete supporting documents.  

 
 

Audit Observation No. 5 
 
Delay in the completion of the Computerized Enrollment System Software Program of 
CFCST contravened the Contract Agreement and Section 68 of Implementing Rules 
and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9184 thus, deprived the end-users/beneficiaries of the 
immediate use and benefits that could be derived thereon and may result to the 
accumulation of liquidated damages. 



26 
 

Section 68 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9184 
states that “all contracts executed in accordance with this act shall contain a provision on 
liquidated damages which shall be payable by the contractor in case of breach thereof.  For 
the procurement of goods, infrastructure projects and consulting services, the amount of 
liquidated damages shall be at least equal to one-tenth of one (1) percent (0.1%) of the cost 
of unperformed portion for every day of delay.  Once the cumulative amount of liquidated 
damages reaches ten percent (10%) of the amount of the contract, the procuring entity may 
rescind or terminate the contract, without prejudice to other courses of action and remedies 
available under the circumstances”. 
 

A Contract Agreement was signed on July 15, 2019 between by Mr. Ali K. 
Dilangalen, CFCST President (referred to as the “Entity”) & Mr. Thomas C. Saddul, 
Proprietor of Digital Software Consultancy Technology (referred to as the “Software 
Provider”).  The total amount of the contract is ₱4,490,000.00 and the contract duration is 
for the period of 180 days.  
 

The scope of services to be performed by the Software Provider consists of the 
following:  (a.) System analysis and design based on the different modules; (b.) 
Customization of reports based on user’s requirement; (c.) Software installation including 
security features; (d.) Data migration; (e.) Installation of system server consisting of one 
administrator control and monitoring panel and 11 PC workstation; (f.) Installation of 3 
kiosks; and (g.) User’s training including manual of operation. 
 

The copy of Notice to Proceed was acknowledged and signed by the Provider on 
July 25, 2019.  Also, the contract agreement stipulated the schedule of payment such as; 
Mobilization upon approval of the contract-15%; Installation of the software into the server-
25%; Implementation of student information system module-25%; Implementation of 
accounting system module-25%; and Retention until acceptance-10%.  Further, the Provider 
submitted their Work Presentation Table (180 days) and Schedule of Deliveries & 
Collections as follows:

As of December 31, 2020, audit review of the disbursement vouchers disclosed that 
the agency has paid the Provider the total net amount of ₱2,289,900.00, details of which are

As shown above, the work accomplishment is only 50% and reckoned from date of 
the Notice to Proceed, the implementation of the installation of the software systems project 
should have been completed on January 22, 2020.  Notwithstanding the violations noted in 
the contract and the subsequent payments made, the non-completion of the installation of the 
software program is tantamount to breach of contract and thus, denied the CFCST students, 
faculties and employees the immediate use and benefits thereon. 
 

Management in its reply stated that an additional training for the Accounting and HR 
Departments are scheduled for their respective modules of the aforementioned software 
program for a better understanding to fully assimilate its functions.  In addition, 
management has made its final payment to the software provider last March of 2020 
supported by Journal Entry Voucher No. 20200312 and Check No. 1140087 amounting to 
P1,840,900.00 however, as of the preparation of this report, the management has yet to 
transmit to the Auditor’s Office the disbursement voucher and supporting documents 
relative to the said payment.  The Audit team maintains its stand that said software program 
remains incomplete until all its required trainings are conducted and a full run-through of the 
software program is organized to ensure that it is fully ready and functional among all 
departments. 

 
Recommendations:  
 

We recommended that management compel the Software Provider to finish and 
complete immediately the installation of the Software Program-Enrollment System and 
conduct training for the concerned Accounting and HR Personnel for the immediate use of 
the end-users.  Considering the lapse of time and delay in the completion of the project, 
liquidated damages should be imposed against the Provider in accordance with Section 68 of 
the Revised IRR of RA 9184.

VALIDATION 

1. The existence, accuracy and 
reliability of the PPE account totaling 
P100,178,512.85 as of December 31, 
2019 cannot be relied upon due to 
continuous failure of the Management to 
conduct a complete physical count and 
reconciliation of records. 
  
We recommended management to:  
a. Seriously address the above-
mentioned lapses in the management of 
the College's properties by directing all 
concerned officials to strictly comply 
with the Section 3 Chapter 10 of the 
GAM in the proper recognition of PPE 
accounts; and direct the property officer 
to conduct complete physical inventory, 
reconcile with the accounting records 
and monitor of all properties; and                                                      
b. Take up the necessary adjusting 
journal entries on valid reconciling items 
noted for an accurate financial 
presentation. 
 
2. The agency failed to remit in full 
taxes withheld from suppliers/creditors 
to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) 
contrary to Section 114 of the National 
Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997. 
  
We recommended management to:  
Direct the acting accountant to 
immediately settle with the BIR the 
unremmited taxes withheld for CY 2019 
and assign personnel to closely monitor 
the remittance of taxes withheld to avoid 
over/under/delayed remittances.

3. Fund transfers from MDS to 
Trust Fund Accounts totaling 
P4,468,779.51 were made despite 
deficiencies in supporting documents and 
contrary to the provisions of Executive 
Order (EO) No. 91. 
 
We recommended management to:  
a. Stop the practice of transferring funds 
from one fund cluster to another 
specifically on transfers from MDS/Fund 
101 to various Trust Fund Accounts to 
avoid reversion of unutilized funds at 
quarter-end; b. Account for the 
transferred amounts and the 
corresponding disbursements and return 
the unused funds by remitting to the 
National Treasury; c. Submit to the audit 
team the transactions relating to 
disbursements charged to the funds 
transferred and other relevant reports; and 
d. Comply with the provisions of EO. No. 
91 to present a reliable consolidated Cash 
in Bank-LCCA balance. 
 
4. Receipt of Inter-Agency 
Transferred Funds amounting 
P27,055,362.00 were erroneously 
recorded as revenue contrary to Section 
63 paragraph D of the GAM Volume 1, 
thereby affecting the fair presentation of 
the financial statement. 

 
We recommended and management 
agreed: 

 1) Effect the necessary adjustments to 
correct the balances in the financial 
statements;  

 2) Ensure that all fund transfers shall be 
supported with a MOA and furnish 
copies to COA; and 

 3) Ensure that the receipt, utilization and 
liquidation of the fund transfer shall be 
properly monitored and recorded in 
accordance with GAM.

5. Reliability of the year-end 
balances of Cash in Bank, LCCA and 
other affected accounts are doubtful and 
misstated due to unrecorded transfer of 
funds from Cash in Bank - MDS to Cash 
in Bank - LCCA resulting to 
understatement by P15,186,585.82, thus 
affecting the fair presentation of the 
financial statements. 
 
We recommend and management agreed: 
1) Instruct the accountant to effect the 
necessary adjustment to correct the 
reported balances of the affected accounts 
in the financial statements; 
2) Implement the previous year's audit 
recommendation to stop the practice of 
transferring funds from Fund 101 to Fund 
161. 
 
6. Delayed/Incomplete submission 
of copies of purchase orders and/or 
perfected contracts contrary to COA 
Circular No. 2009-001 thereby 
precluded the auditorial review and 
technical review of the procurement 
transactions and prompt 
detection/correction of possible 
deficiencies 
 
We recommended and management 
agreed to: 
1) Require the BAC Secretariat or 
concerned employees to justify and 
submit all unsubmitted perfected 
contracts and its supporting documents 
entered in calendar years 2017 up to 
present.                                                                   
2) Strict Adherence to the provisions of 
COA Circular No. 2009-001, prescribing 
the submission of copies of contracts and 
the required supporting documents for 
timely review and evaluation thereof.

7. Despite the mandatory 
requirement to insure all government 
properties with the General Insurance 
Fund (GIF) of the Government Service 
Insurance System (GSIS) pursuant to 
Administrative Order No. 33 dated 
August 25, 1987 and COA Circular No. 
92-390 dated November 11, 1992, 
government properties such as school and 
office buildings and its contents with a 
book value of P132,513,951.87 remained 
not insured with GSIS GIF exposing 
these properties to unnecessary risk of not 
being indemnified for any damage of loss 
due to any fortuitous events such as fire, 
earthquake, typhoon and/or flood. 
 
We recommended and management 
agreed to: 
1) Revisit Administrative Order No. 33 
and COA Circular No. 92-390 and 
prepare and submit inventory reports of 
all insurable properties to GSIS to ensure 
that all insurable assets and properties are 
adequately covered/insured with the GIF 
of the GSIS to properly protect the 
government properties in the event of 
serious loss such as fire, earthquake, 
typhoon and/or flood;                              
 
2) Provide a budget for the insurance of 
all insurable properties pursuant to the 
provisions of FA No. 656, Property 
Insurance Law, to protect the interest of 
the government and to be indemnified 
for any damage or loss that may arise. 
 
8. The year-end balance of the 
Property, Plant and Equipment accounts 
at book value of P180,578,822.77 as of 
December 31, 2018 cannot be relied upon

March 31, 2019, in violation of Section 
107 of PD 1445 and pertinent provisions 
of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 
18, 1995, thus the validity and propriety 
of said disbursements and the correctness 
of the recorded transactions were not 
ascertained. 
 
We recommended and management 
agreed to: 
1) Require the Acting Accountant and all 
other officials concerned to immediately 
submit the lacking DVs covering CY 
2017 and 2018 disbursements and 
henceforth, enjoin the personnel 
concerned to consistently observe the 
submission of accounts and financial

We recommend that for adequate control 
of the agency assets and to support
