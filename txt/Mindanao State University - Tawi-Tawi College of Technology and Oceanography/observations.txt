Annual Audit Report on the Mindanao State University Tawi-Tawi College of Technology and Oceanography, Tawi-Tawi for CY 2020




 
 

1. Delayed submission of disbursement vouchers, payrolls, trial balances, bank 
reconciliation as well as Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and Report of Collections 
and Deposits (RCD) for both General and Trust Funds for the Calendar Year 2020 
to the Office of the Auditor, in violation of Section 107 and Section 122 of PD 
1445 (State Audit Code of the Philippines), Section 7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 
2009-006 and Sections 59 and 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs and Article 218 of the Revised Penal Code 
thereby retraining the Audit Team to render timely audit. 
 

2. Delayed and/or non-submission of copies of contracts/ Purchase Orders (POs)/ 
Job Orders (JOs), Memorandum of Agreements (MOAs) with Commission on 
Higher Education (CHED), Department of Science and Technology (DOST), 
United Nations (UN) and other agencies whether public or private agencies to the 
Office of the Auditor within the prescribed timeline contrary to Section 107 and 
122 of PD 1445, and COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, 
thereby prevented the Audit Team to effectively review and evaluate the contracts 
at the most appropriate time and manner.  
 

3. MSU-TCTO was not compliant with the Transparency Seal as mandated by 
Section 94 of General Appropriations Act (GAA) for CY 2020 and the provisions 
of Section 93 of GAA 2020 with regards to Transparency of Infrastructure 
Projects due to non-awareness of the Management of the said provisions that lead 
to deprivation of information of the stakeholders and/or end-users of the 
University that need transparency and accountability. 
 

4. The University does not provide at the beginning of the year, their respective 
assigned Supervising Auditors (SAs) and Audit Team Leaders (ATLs) with a list 
of all on-going government projects/programs/activities (PPA) and those that are 
to be implemented during the year and tarpaulins signboards for infrastructure 
projects were not posted or displayed in the project location in the manner 
prescribed in COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 2013, thereby 
restraining public participation in the promotion of good governance through 
transparency and accountability. 
 

5. For the CY 2020, contract documents for infrastructure projects with all of its 
supporting documents and purchase orders issued for supplies and materials were 
still not furnished to the Auditor’s office within five (5) working days from the 
date the contract was perfected and purchase orders were issued in violation of the 
provisions of Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1, respectively of COA Circular No. 2009-
001, resulting to delay of the Auditor in conducting review and in informing 
Management of defects/deficiencies, if any and delay in informing the  Technical 
Audit Specialist (TAS) assigned in the auditing unit/cluster or to the Regional 
Technical Services Office (RTSO), as the case may be, for inspection so that 



 
 

100% completed project could be turnover by the contractor and accepted by the 
Management. 
 

6. Failure to prepare and submit Annual Procurement Plan (APP) and Project 
Procurement Management Plan (PPMP) for CY 2020, thereby affecting the 
evaluation of the legality and propriety of the audited procured goods and 
infrastructure projects in violation of Section 7 (Procurement Planning and 
Budget Linkage), Rule II (Procurement Planning) of the revised IRR of RA 9184 
otherwise known as the Government Procurement Reform Act. 
 

7. The University failed to submit sufficient data of its Updated Agency Personnel 
Profile (plantilla of personnel) as of December 31, 2020 contrary to Section 122 
of PD 1445. The inability of the Personnel Division to submit the current plantilla 
of personnel casted doubt as to the legality, propriety and appropriateness of the 
amount charged in the Personnel Services. 
 

 The other audit findings together with the recommended courses of action which 
were discussed by the Audit Team with concerned Management officials and staff during 
the exit conference on April 28, 2021 are discussed in detail in Part II of the report. 
 
 We request that the recommendations be promptly implemented and we would 
appreciate being informed of the actions taken thereon within sixty days (60) days from 
receipt hereof, using the prescribed format of the attached copy of the Agency Action 
Plan and Status of Implementation (AAPSI) pursuant to Section 89 (Report on 
Commission on Audit Findings and Recommendations) of the General Appropriations 
Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 (RA 11465), by filling up the attached Agency 
Action Plan and Status of Implementation (AAPSI) form as required under COA 
Memorandum No. 2014-002 dated March 18, 2014 
 
 We express our appreciation for the support and cooperation extended to the 
Audit Team by the officials and employees of the University.

the Calendar Year 2020. The audit was conducted to: a) ascertain the level of 
assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the consolidated 
financial statements; b) determine the extent of compliance with applicable laws, 
rules and regulations; c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and d) 
determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations. 

 
 

E. Auditor’s Opinion on the Financial Statements  
 

The Auditor rendered unqualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 
presentation of the financial statements of MSU-TCTO as at December 31, 2020. 

 
F.  Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations  

 
1.       Delayed submission of disbursement vouchers, payrolls, trial balances, bank 

reconciliation as well as Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and Report of 
Collections and Deposits (RCD) for both General and Trust Funds for the 
Calendar Year 2020 to the Office of the Auditor, in violation of Section 107 
and Section 122 of PD 1445 (State Audit Code of the Philippines), Section 
7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 and Sections 59 and 60, Chapter 19, 



iv 
 

Volume I of  the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs and 
Article 218 of the Revised Penal Code thereby retraining the Audit Team to 
render timely audit. 
 
We reiterated our recommendations that the Accountable Officers: 
 

a)  Determine and address all the reasons for the delay in the submission 
of the required reports and consider imposing sanctions on the persons 
responsible for the delayed submission of the financial reports and 
supporting documents to the COA Office. Further, review and evaluate 
the performance of the finance personnel; and recommend replacement 
for those found undesirable with qualified personnel with the right 
work attitude; 

 
 
b) Conduct planning, target setting and prepare commitment reports 

particularly on the timelines on the submission of transaction 
documents/reports and financial statements provided in Sections 107 
and 122 of PD 1445, Section 7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 and 
Sections 59 and 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, and 
Article 218 of the Revised Penal Code to avoid repercussions as stated 
therein; and 

 
c) Conduct periodic   monitoring of submission of required reports to 

COA, Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and other 
regulatory bodies and see to it that all the required reports are 
submitted on time. 

 
2.       Delayed and/or non-submission of copies of contracts/ Purchase Orders 

(POs)/ Job Orders (JOs), Memorandum of Agreements (MOAs) with 
Commission on Higher Education (CHED), Department of Science and 
Technology (DOST), United Nations (UN) and other agencies whether public 
or private agencies to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed timeline 
contrary to Section 107 and 122 of PD 1445, and COA Circular No. 2009-001 
dated February 12, 2009, thereby prevented the Audit Team to effectively 
review and evaluate the contracts at the most appropriate time and manner.  
 
We therefore recommended the Management that pertinent copies of 
contracts/POs/JOs, MOAs with CHED, DOST, UN and other agencies 
whether public or private agencies together with its supporting documents 
should be submitted to the auditor within five (5) working days upon approval 
of the projects/programs/activities/contracts. Further, it’s 
Financial/Liquidation Reports should have been submitted to the auditor for 
verification within 60 days after the completion of the same as set under the 
MOA. 
 



v 
 

3.       MSU-TCTO was not compliant with the Transparency Seal as mandated by 
Section 94 of General Appropriations Act (GAA) for CY 2020 and the 
provisions of Section 93 of GAA 2020 with regards to Transparency of 
Infrastructure Projects due to non-awareness of the Management of the said 
provisions that lead to deprivation of information of the stakeholders and/or 
end-users of the University that need transparency and accountability. 

 
We therefore recommended the Management to update the official website of 
the University with information mentioned in Sections 93 and 94 of GAA 
2020 and maintain yearly the update of this information by assigning web 
administrators for these tasks. 

4.      The University does not provide at the beginning of the year, their respective 
assigned Supervising Auditors (SAs) and Audit Team Leaders (ATLs) with a 
list of all on-going government projects/programs/activities (PPA) and those 
that are to be implemented during the year and tarpaulins signboards for 
infrastructure projects were not posted or displayed in the project location in 
the manner prescribed in COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 2013, 
thereby restraining public participation in the promotion of good governance 
through transparency and accountability. 

 
We recommended that Management: 

a)   At the beginning of the year, provide the assigned SA and ATL with a 
list of all on-going government PPA and those that are to be 
implemented during the year; 

 
b)   Direct the Project Engineers to check/monitor the 

University/contractor’s proper installation of signboards/notices of 
implemented PPA; 

 
c)  Inform the Audit Team within ten (10) days after the award of the 

infrastructure project or before the start of the program/activity that the 
appropriate project or before the start of the program/activity that the 
appropriate project signboards and/or public notices are already posted 
in order for the Audit Team to validate the same; and 

 
d)  Post the sign boards and/or public notices in the project location as 

soon as the award of project has been made. 
 

5.       For the CY 2020, contract documents for infrastructure projects with all of its 
supporting documents and purchase orders issued for supplies and materials 
were still not furnished to the Auditor’s office within five (5) working days 
from the date the contract was perfected and purchase orders were issued in 
violation of the provisions of Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1, respectively of COA 
Circular No. 2009-001, resulting to delay of the Auditor in conducting review 
and in informing Management of defects/deficiencies, if any and delay in 



vi 
 

informing the  Technical Audit Specialist (TAS) assigned in the auditing 
unit/cluster or to the Regional Technical Services Office (RTSO), as the case 
may be, for inspection so that 100% completed project could be turnover by 
the contractor and accepted by the Management. 

 
 

We reiterated our recommendations that Management should: 
 
a)   Require the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) to expedite the 

submission of the 2020 approved contracts and strictly ensure that they 
are supported with complete documentation/attachment; 

 
b) Regularly submit within five (5) working days from the execution of 

the contract the contract documents together with all of its supporting 
documents and purchase orders for supplies and materials for current 
and succeeding years; and 

 
c)  Require the concerned personnel to revisit the pertinent rules and 

regulations such as COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 
2009. 

 
6.       Failure to prepare and submit Annual Procurement Plan (APP) and Project 

Procurement Management Plan (PPMP) for CY 2020, thereby affecting the 
evaluation of the legality and propriety of the audited procured goods and 
infrastructure projects in violation of Section 7 (Procurement Planning and 
Budget Linkage), Rule II (Procurement Planning) of the revised IRR of RA 
9184 otherwise known as the Government Procurement Reform Act. 

 
We recommended that the University prepare a meticulous and judicious 
PPMP and consolidate it properly to produce APP for all funds in compliance 
with Section 7 of the Republic Act No. 9184 otherwise known as the 
Government Procurement Reform Act and as required under DBM Circular 
Letter No. 2011-06 and 2011-06A.  

 
7.      The University failed to submit sufficient data of its Updated Agency 

Personnel Profile (plantilla of personnel) as of December 31, 2020 contrary to 
Section 122 of PD 1445. The inability of the Personnel Division to submit the 
current plantilla of personnel casted doubt as to the legality, propriety and 
appropriateness of the amount charged in the Personnel Services. 

 
We recommended that the Management should instruct the HRMO 
Department to submit current plantilla of personnel every year and also to 
furnish the Auditor Office a copy of approved appointment/contract of service 
of every newly hired, promoted as well as the newly renewed contract.

G.  Status of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 

  Of the thirty two (32) prior year’s audit recommendations, fourteen (14) were 
fully implemented, eight (8) were partially implemented, and ten (10) still not 
implemented as of report date.

Unmodified Opinion 
 

We have audited the financial statements of the Mindanao State University-Tawi-Tawi 
College of Technology and Oceanography, Bongao, Tawi-Tawi which comprise the 
Statement of Position as at December 31, 2020, and the Statement of Financial 
Performance, the Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity and Statement of Cash Flows 
and Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts for the year then ended, and 
Notes to the Financial Statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. 

 
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material 
respects, the financial position of the MSU-TCTO as at December 31, 2020, and its 
financial performance, its cash flows, its comparison of budget and actual amounts, and its 
notes to financial statements for the year then ended in accordance with International 
Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs). 
 
Basis for Unmodified Opinion 
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 
Institutions (ISSAIs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in 
the Auditor’s Responsibilities of the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the agency in accordance with the ethical requirements that 
are relevant to our audit of the financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence 
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Responsibilities of Management and those Charged with Governance for the 
Financial Statements 

 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial 
statements in accordance with IPSASs, and for such internal control as management 
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  

 
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the MSU-TCTO’s financial 
reporting process. 

 
 

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as 
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.

MINDANAO STATE UNIVERSITY 
TAWI-TAWI COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY 

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
For the year ended December 31, 2020 

(All amounts in Philippine Peso unless otherwise stated) 
 
 

1. General Information/Agency Profile 
 

The financial statements of Mindanao State University – Tawi-Tawi College of 
Technology and Oceanography (MSU-TCTO) were authorized for issue on 
February 11, 2021 as shown in the Statement of Management Responsibility for 
Financial Statements signed by Mary Joyce Z. Guinto-Sali, PhD, the 
University Chancellor.  
 
The MSU-TCTO was established in Southern Sulu under the Republic Act No. 
6060 on August 4, 1969 as the Sulu College of Technology and Oceanography 
and as an integral unit of Mindanao State University. On March 16, 1982, under 
the Batas Pambansa Blg. 197, the name of Sulu College of Technology and 
Oceanography was changed into Tawi-Tawi College of Technology and 
Oceanography with the creation of the Province of Tawi-Tawi.  
 
As mandated by the operation of Republic Act No. 6060, the college shall extend 
to the Muslims and the other cultural minority groups the opportunities of college 
education and develop such other programs as will promote Muslim welfare and 
hasten the economic development of the southernmost region of the Philippines. 
In keeping with this mandate, the college shall develop academic programs for 
effective exploitation and conservation of the fisheries resources in the Sulu seas 
and nearby waters, undertake researches in fish processing and culture, and in 
oceanography for increased understanding of the country’s territorial waters, and 
economic development of the people. As a leading institution of learning 
committed to community – centered sustainable development, the college shall 
develop distinctive competencies, organizational capacities and individual 
capabilities in order to become a center of excellence in Fisheries, Marine 
Sciences and Engineering, and Oceanography. It shall also help develop Tawi-
Tawi into becoming a haven of peace and prosperity.  
 
The financial statement being presented is a true and complete statement of all 
accounts as shown in the General Ledger, prepared in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles and standards.  

 
2. Statement of Compliance and Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements 

 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and comply with 
the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) issued by the 
Commission on Audit per COA Resolution No. 2017-003 dated January 24, 2017. 



 
10 

 

The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, unless 
stated otherwise. The Statement of Cash Flows is prepared using the direct 
method. 

 
3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

 
3.1 Basis of accounting 
 

The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with 
the PPSAS. 

 
3.2 Financial instruments 

 
a. Financial assets 

 
Initial recognition and measurement 
 
Financial assets within the scope of PPSAS 29-Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement are classified as financial assets at fair 
value through surplus or deficit, held-to-maturity investments, loans and 
receivables or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. The 
MSU-TCTO determines the classification of its financial assets at initial 
recognition. 
 
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets 
within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the 
marketplace (regular way trades) are recognized on the trade date, i.e., 
the date that the MSU-TCTO commits to purchase or sell the asset. 
 
The MSU-TCTO's financial assets include: cash and short-term deposits; 
trade and other receivables; loans and other receivables.  

 
Subsequent measurement 
 
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their 
classification. 
 
Loans and Receivables 
 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. After 
initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at 
amortized cost using effective interest method, less impairment. 
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or 
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are integral part of the 



 
11 

 

effective interest rate. Losses arising from impairment are recognized in 
the surplus or deficit. 
 
Derecognition 
 
The MSU-TCTO derecognizes a financial asset or, where applicable, a 
part of a financial asset or part of MSU-TCTO of similar financial assets 
when: 
 
    The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or is 

waived 
 
 The MSU-TCTO has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from 

the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows 
in full without material delay to a third party; and either: (a) the 
MSU-TCTO has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of 
the asset; or (b) the MSU-TCTO has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred 
control of the asset. 

 
b. Financial liabilities 

 
Initial recognition and measurement 

 
Financial liabilities within the scope of PPSAS 29 are classified as 
financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit or loans and 
borrowings, as appropriate. The entity determines the classification of its 
financial liabilities at initial recognition. 
 
All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the 
case of loans and borrowings, plus directly attributable transaction costs. 
 
The MSU-TCTO’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, 
bank overdrafts, loans and borrowings, financial guarantee contracts. 

 
 

Subsequent measurement 
 
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification.  
 
Financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit 

 
Financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit include 
financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated 
upon initial recognition as at fair value through surplus or deficit. 
 



 
12 

 

Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired 
for the purpose of selling in the near term. 
 
This category includes derivative financial instruments entered into by 
the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge 
relationships as defined by PPSAS 29. 
 
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in surplus or 
deficit. 
 
Loans and borrowing 
 
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest 
method. 
Gains and losses are recognized in surplus or deficit when the liabilities 
are derecognized as well as through the effective interest method 
amortization process. 
 
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or 
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the 
effective interest rate. 

 
Derecognition 
 
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the 
liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
 

 
3.3 Cash and cash equivalents 

 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash at bank. 

 
3.4 Inventories 

 
Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition. To the extent that 
inventory was received through non-exchange transactions (for no cost or 
for a nominal cost), the cost of the inventory is its fair value at the date of 
acquisition. 
 
Inventories are recognized as an expense when deployed for utilization or 
consumption in the ordinary course of operations of the MSU-TCTO. 

 
 
 
 



 
13 

 

3.5 Property, Plant and Equipment 
 

Recognition 
 
An item is recognized as property, plant, and equipment (PPE) if it meets 
the characteristics and recognition criteria as a PPE. 
 
The characteristics of PPE are as follows: 

 
   tangible items; 
   are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for 

rental to others, or for administrative purposes; and 
   are expected to be used during more than one reporting period. 
 
An item of PPE is recognized as an asset if: 
 
   It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated 

with the item will flow to the entity; and 
   The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably. 
 
Measurement at Recognition 
 
An item recognized as PPE is measured at cost. 
 
A PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction is measured at its fair 
value as at the date of acquisition. 
 
The cost of the PPE is the cash price equivalent or, for PPE acquired 
through non-exchange transaction its cost is its fair value as at recognition 
date. 
 
Cost includes the following: 

 
   Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase 

taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates; 
   expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items; 

and 
    initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and 

restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an 
entity incurs either when the item is acquired, or as a consequence of 
having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than 
to produce inventories during that period. 

 
 
 
 



 
14 

 

Measurement After Recognition 
 
After recognition, all PPE are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses. 
 
When significant parts of PPE are required to be replaced at intervals, the 
MSU-TCTO recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful 
lives and depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major 
repair/replacement is done, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of 
the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are 
satisfied. 
 
All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense in surplus 
or deficit as incurred. 
 
Depreciation 
 
Each part of an item of PPE with a cost that is significant in relation to the 
total cost of the item is depreciated separately. 
 
The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expense unless it is 
included in the cost of another asset. 
 
Initial Recognition of Depreciation 
 
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it 
is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in 
the manner intended by management. 
 
For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation is 
for one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the 
month. 
However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, 
depreciation is for the succeeding month. 
 
 
Depreciation Method 
 
The straight line method of depreciation is adopted unless another method is 
more appropriate for agency operation. 
 
Estimated Useful Life 
 
The MSU-TCTO uses the Schedule on the Estimated Useful Life of PPE by 
classification prepared by COA. 
 



 
15 

 

The MSU-TCTO uses a residual value equivalent to at least five percent 
(5%) of the cost of the PPE. 
 
Impairment 
 
An asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount, or 
recoverable service amount, if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its 
estimated recoverable service amount. 
 
Derecognition 
 
The MSU-TCTO derecognizes items of PPE and/or any significant part of 
an asset upon disposal or when no future economic benefits or service 
potential is expected from its continuing use. Any gain or loss arising on 
derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the 
surplus or deficit when the asset is derecognized. 
 

3.6 Leases 
 

Mindanao State University – Tawi-Tawi College of Technology and 
Oceanography as a lessee 

 
Finance Lease 
 
Finance leases are leases that transfer substantially all of the risks and 
benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item to the MSU-TCTO. 
 
Assets held under a finance lease are capitalized at the commencement of 
the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present 
value of the future minimum lease payments. The MSU-TCTO also 
recognizes the associated lease liability at the inception of the lease. The 
liability recognized is measured as the present value of the future minimum 
lease payments at initial recognition. 
 
Subsequent to initial recognition, lease payments are apportioned between 
finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance 
charges are recognized as finance costs in surplus or deficit. 
 
An asset held under a finance lease is depreciated over the useful life of the 
asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the MSU-TCTO will 
obtain ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, the asset is 
depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the 
lease term. 
 



 
16 

 

Operating lease 
 
Operating leases are leases that do not transfer substantially all the risks and 
benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item to the MSU-TCTO. 
Operating lease payments are recognized as an operating expense in surplus 
or deficit on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
 
Mindanao State University – Tawi-Tawi College of Technology and 
Oceanography as a lessor 
 
Finance Lease 
 
The MSU-TCTO recognizes lease payments receivable under a finance 
lease as assets in the statements of financial position. The assets are 
presented as receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. 
 
The finance revenue are recognized based on a pattern reflecting a constant 
periodic rate of return on the net investment in the finance lease.  

 
 

Operating Lease 
 

Leases in which the MSU-TCTO does not transfer substantially all the risks 
and benefits of ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. 
 
Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the 
carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term. 
 
Rent received from an operating lease is recognized as income on a straight-
line basis over the lease term. Contingent rents are recognized as revenue in 
the period in which they are earned. 
 
The depreciation policy for PPE are applied to similar assets leased by the 
entity.  

 
3.7 Changes in accounting policies and estimates 

 
The MSU-TCTO recognizes the effects of changes in accounting policy 
retrospectively. The effects of changes in accounting policy were applied 
prospectively if retrospective application is impractical. 
 
The MSU-TCTO recognizes the effects of changes in accounting estimates 
prospectively by including in surplus or deficit. 
 
The MSU-TCTO correct material prior period errors retrospectively in the 
first set of financial statements authorized for issue after their discovery by: 



 
17 

 

   Restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in which 
the error occurred; or 

   If the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating 
the opening balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for the 
earliest prior period presented. 

 
3.8 Revenue from non-exchange transactions 

 
Recognition and Measurement of Assets from Non-Exchange 
Transactions 
 
An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction, other than services 
in-kind, that meets the definition of an asset were recognized as an asset if 
the following criteria were met: 
 
   It is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential 

associated with the asset will flow to the entity; and 
  The fair value of the asset can be measured reliably. 
 
An asset acquired through a non-exchange transaction is initially measured 
at its fair value as at the date of acquisition. 
 
Recognition Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions 
 
An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction recognized as an 
asset is recognized as revenue, except to the extent that a liability is also 
recognized in respect of the same inflow. 
 
As MSU-TCTO satisfies a present obligation recognized as a liability in 
respect of an inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction 
recognized as an asset, it reduces the carrying amount of the liability 
recognized and recognize an amount of revenue equal to that reduction. 
 
Measurement of Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions 
 
Revenue from non-exchange transactions is measured at the amount of the 
increase in net assets recognized by the entity, unless a corresponding 
liability is recognized. 
 
Measurement of Liabilities on Initial Recognition from Non-Exchange 
Transactions 
 
The amount recognized as a liability in a non-exchange transaction is the 
best estimate of the amount required to settle the present obligation at the 
reporting date. 
Gifts and Donations 



 
18 

 

The MSU-TCTO recognizes assets and revenue from gifts and donations 
when it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential 
will flow to the entity and the fair value of the assets can be measured 
reliably. 
 
Goods in-kind were recognized as assets when the goods were received, or 
there is a binding arrangement to receive the goods. If goods in-kind were 
received without conditions attached, revenue is recognized immediately. If 
conditions were attached, a liability is recognized, which is reduced and 
revenue recognized as the conditions were satisfied. 
 
On initial recognition, gifts and donations including goods in-kind were 
measured at their fair value as at the date of acquisition, which were 
ascertained by reference to an active market, or by appraisal. An appraisal of 
the value of an asset is normally undertaken by a member of the valuation 
profession who holds a recognized and relevant professional qualification. 
For many assets, the fair value were ascertained by reference to quoted 
prices in an active and liquid market. 
 
 
Transfers from other government entities 
 
Revenues from non-exchange transactions with other government entities 
and the related assets were measured at fair value and recognized on 
obtaining control of the asset (cash, goods, services and property) if the 
transfer is free from conditions and it is probable that the economic benefits 
or service potential related to the asset will flow to the MSU-TCTO and can 
be measured reliably. 
 

3.9 Revenue from Exchange transactions 
 

Measurement of Revenue 
 
Revenue was measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable. 

 
Sale of Goods 
 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, usually on delivery 
of the goods and when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and 
it is probable that the economic benefits or service potential associated with 
the transaction will flow to the MSU-TCTO. 

 
Rental income 
 



 
19 

 

Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is 
accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and included in 
revenue. 
 

3.10 Budget information 
 

The annual budget is prepared on a cash basis and is published in the 
government website. 
 
A separate Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts 
(SCBAA) was prepared since the budget and the financial statements were 
not prepared on comparable basis. The SCBAA was presented showing the 
original and final budget and the actual amounts on comparable basis to the 
budget.  
 

3.11 Employee benefits 
 

The employees of MSU-TCTO are member of the Government Service 
Insurance System (GSIS), which provides life and retirement insurance 
coverage. 
 
The MSU-TCTO recognizes the undiscounted amount of short term 
employee benefits, like salaries, wages, bonuses, allowance, etc., as expense 
unless capitalized, and as a liability after deducting the amount paid. 
 
The MSU-TCTO recognizes expenses for accumulating compensated 
absences when these were paid (commuted or paid as terminal leave 
benefits). 
 
Unused entitlements that has accumulated at the reporting date were not 
recognized as expense. Non-accumulating compensated absences, like 
special leave privileges, were not recognized. 
 

4. Changes in Accounting Policies 
 

MSU-TCTO has not adopted any new accounting policies for 2020. 
 

5. Prior Period Adjustments 
 

The MSU-TCTO has unrecorded cash balance in the previous years. This is 
corrected this 2019 for proper recognition and measurement of Cash in Bank – 
LCCA – LBP under the Internally Generated Income Fund (Fund 05).

RECOMMENDATIONS

AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

A. Financial and Compliance Audit 
 
1. Delayed submission of disbursement vouchers, payrolls, trial balances, bank 

reconciliation as well as Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and Report of 
Collections and Deposits (RCD) for both General and Trust Funds for the 
Calendar Year 2020 to the Office of the Auditor, in violation of Section 107 
and Section 122 of PD 1445 (State Audit Code of the Philippines), Section 
7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 and Sections 59 and 60, Chapter 19, 
Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs, and 
Article 218 of the Revised Penal Code, thereby refraining the Audit Team to 
render timely audit. 
 

PD 1445, otherwise known as the State Audit Code of the Philippines, 
provides among others the following:  

 
Section 107. Time and mode of rendering account. In the absence 
of specific provision of law, all accountable officers shall render 
their accounts, submit their vouchers, and make deposits of money 
collected or held by them at such times and in such manner as shall 
be prescribed in the regulations of the Commission. 

 
Section 122. Submission of reports.  Whenever deemed necessary 
in the exigencies of the service, the Commission may under 
regulations issued by it require the agency heads, chief 
accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, 
administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials 
of the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory 
reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as 
may be necessary for the exercise of its functions.  

  
(2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the 

documents and reports mentioned herein shall 
automatically cause the suspension of payment of their 
salaries until they shall have complied with the 
requirements of the Commission.  

  
(3) No appropriation authorized in the General Appropriations 

Act shall be available to pay the salary or any official or 
employee who violates the provisions  of this section, 
without prejudice to any disciplinary  action that may be 
instituted against such official or employee.  

 



31 
 

Likewise, Section 7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 
15, 2009 Prescribing the use of the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of 
Accounts states that:  

 
The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official 
performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the 
audited agency shall ensure that: 
 

a) the reports and supporting documents submitted by the 
accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books 
of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten 
(10) days of the ensuing month; 

 
b) the financial records are made accessible at reasonable 

hours to the Auditor or his authorized representatives when 
needed.  

 
Moreover, Section 59, Note 4 Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 

I, which provides that: 
  

The pre-closing trial balance and other reports shall be submitted 
within ten (10) days after the end of the month to COA Resident 
Auditor and DBM while, year-end trial balances and other reports 
shall be submitted on or before February 14 of the following year 
to COA Resident Auditor, DBM and Government Accountancy 
Sector, COA.  

 
Also, Section 60 of the same Manual provided for the deadlines on the 

submission of financial statements and schedules. 
 

  Provisions of Article 218 of Revised Penal Code also states that: 
 
Failure of accountable Officer to render accounts - Any public 
officer, whether in the service or separated therefrom by 
resignation or any other cause, who is required by law or 
regulation to render accounts to the Insular Auditor (now 
Commission on Audit), or to provincial auditor and who fails to do 
so for a period of two months after such accounts should be 
rendered, shall be punished by prison correctional in its minimum 
period, or by a fine ranging from 200 to 6,000 pesos, or both. 

 
Verifications made and inventory of disbursement vouchers, payrolls, RCI 

and RD and financial statements revealed that the Accountable Officers render 
their respective accounts 2 to 3 weeks delayed due to uncontrollable events like 
brownouts, accountable officer/s absences due to sickness and other important 
matters, clerical errors need to be repeated, office equipment failure, bulk 



32 
 

transactions and delay in the processing of documents from one signatories to 
another and many others. 

 
This deficiency has been noted and corrected in the previous year but 

repeatedly done this year because the responsible personnel concerned failed to 
act appropriately and comply with the recurring recommendation in the previous 
years.  

 
The existing condition could have been improved had there been proper 

planning, target setting, preparation of the commitment reports, and periodic 
monitoring by the Office of the Director for Finance. 

 
The foregoing condition prevented the timely conduct of post-audit and 

review of financial statements and schedules. Consequently, Management’s 
assertions of occurrence, accuracy, validity, and completeness of the transactions 
could not be promptly established, thereby, defeating the purpose of providing 
timely and reliable significant financial information to end-users. 

 
The inability of the above-mentioned University personnel to comply with 

PD 1445 and other existing  rules and regulations on the timely and prompt 
submission transactions documents along with the accountability reports such as 
the report of check issued and/or disbursements to the Audit Team/Auditor for 
timely examination and post-audit causes the delay in the preparations and 
submission of audit reports. 

 
If there is an undue delay in the reporting of information, it may lose its 

relevance. To provide information on a timely basis, it may often be necessary to 
report before all aspects of a transaction are known, thus, impairing reliability. 
Conversely, if reporting is delayed until all aspects are known, the information 
may be highly reliable but of little use to users who have had to make decisions in 
the interim. In achieving a balance between relevance and reliability, the 
overriding consideration is how best to satisfy the decision-making needs of users 
(Appendix A, PPSAS 1). 

 
We reiterated our recommendations that the Accountable Officers: 

 
a) Determine and address all the reasons for the delay in the 

submission of the required reports and consider imposing 
sanctions on the persons responsible for the delayed submission of 
the financial reports and supporting documents to the COA 
Office. Further, review and evaluate the performance of the 
finance personnel; and recommend replacement for those found 
undesirable with qualified personnel with the right work attitude; 

 
b) Conduct planning, target setting and prepare commitment reports 

particularly on the timelines on the submission of transaction 



33 
 

documents/reports and financial statements provided in Sections 
107 and 122 of PD 1445, Section 7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-
006 and Sections 59 and 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for 
NGAs, and Article 218 of the Revised Penal Code to avoid 
repercussions stated herein; and 

 
c) Conduct periodic   monitoring of submission of required reports to 

COA, Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and other 
regulatory bodies and see to it that all the required reports are 
submitted on time. 

 
The Management informed the Audit Team that they will hasten the 

submission of reports to the office of the auditor and strictly comply with the 
recommendations of the Team. 

 
 
2. Delayed and/or non-submission of copies of contracts/ Purchase Orders 

(POs)/ Job Orders (JOs), Memorandum of Agreements (MOAs) with 
Commission on Higher Education (CHED), Department of Science and 
Technology (DOST), United Nations (UN) and other agencies whether public 
or private agencies to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed timeline 
contrary to Section 107 and 122 of PD 1445, and COA Circular No. 2009-001 
dated February 12, 2009, thereby prevented the Audit Team to effectively 
review and evaluate the contracts at the most appropriate time and manner.  

 
Section 107 and Section 122 of PD 1445 requires that the Management 

submit reports to the Commission in a timely manner as elaborately stated above. 
  
Further, COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 prescribes 

submission of copy of government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting 
documents to the COA as provided under the following sections, to wit:   

3.0 SUBMISSION AND REVIEW PROCESS  

3.1 Contracts  

3.1.1 Within five (5) working days from the execution of a 
contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, 
agencies or instrumentalities, including government-
owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, 
a copy of said contract and each of all the documents 
forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall 
be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned. In 
case of agencies audited on an engagement basis, 
submission of a copy of the contract and its supporting 
documents shall be to the Auditor of the mother agency 
or parent company, as the case may be.  



34 
 

3.1.4 The auditorial review shall consist in the evaluation of 
compliance with the requirements of applicable laws, 
rules and regulations, completeness of documentary 
requirements and an initial evaluation that the contractual 
covenants are not disadvantageous to the government. 
Without waiting for the lapse of the period herein 
established, the Auditor concerned shall call the 
immediate attention of management regarding defects 
and deficiencies noted in the contract and suggest such 
corrective measures as are appropriate and warranted. 
Where the defect or deficiency is not susceptible of 
rectification and renders the contract totally or partially 
void, the head of the agency shall be notified within 
twenty-four (24) hours from such determination 
indicating the reasons therein.  

 
3.1.7 The procedures and timelines herein outlined shall also 

apply to supplementary contracts, variation orders and the 
like. 

3.2 Purchase Orders  

3.2.1 A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and 
each and every supporting document, shall, within five 
(5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to 
the Auditor concerned. Within the same period, the 
Auditor shall review and point out to management defects 
and/or deficiencies, if any, in the same manner provided 
in the second and third sentences of item 3.1.4 hereof 

3.2.2 In case of doubt as to the reasonableness of the price of 
the items purchased, the Auditor shall conduct a canvass 
thereof making use of price references provided, among 
others, by legitimate suppliers, the Procurement Service, 
the Technical Services Office, other government agencies 
with similar procurement and those posted in the internet.  

Moreover, failure on the part of the officials and employees to comply 
with the said ruling shall be penalized as stated under the Section 4 of the same 
Circular which states that: 

 

 4.0 PENALTY CLAUSE  

 4.1 Any unjustified failure of the officials and employees 
concerned to comply with the requirements herein 
imposed shall be subject to the administrative 
disciplinary action provided in (a) Section 127 of 



35 
 

Presidential Decree No. 1445; (b) Section 55, Title I-
B, Book V of the Revised Administrative Code of 
1987; and (c) Section 11 of Republic Act No. 6713.  

 4.2  Upon receipt of information or discovery by the 
auditor of such failure by management to comply 
with the required submission, an Audit Observation 
Memorandum shall be issued by him calling the 
attention of the latter, and requesting compliance, else 
the transactions covered by the unsubmitted 
documents be suspended in audit and the penalty 
prescribed by law under 4.1 be enforced.  

As per observation of the Audit Team, the Management was not 
submitting any Memorandum of Agreement or Memorandum of Understanding or 
Letter of Understanding and the likes with any of the public or private agencies 
e.g (CHED, DOST, UN, etc.) within five (5) days after the excecution of the 
contract that will lead to the prevention of the Audit Team to review and verify 
them at the most appropriate time and manner.  

Though some of the contracts, POs, and MOAs are attached to the 
disbursement vouchers as supporting documents for the initial transaction, these 
documents are forwarded to the office of the auditor for more than five days 
already after the execution thereof or worst said documents are only forwarded to 
the Office upon request of source agencies of the liquidation of related funds duly 
verified by the Office in order to become eligible for another fund transfer. Thus, 
due to the non-submission and/or delay of submission of these contracts, POs, and 
MOAs together with its supporting documents, the Audit Team cannot verify and 
evaluate the appropriateness of the transactions in proper time and manner. 

We therefore recommended the Management that pertinent copies of 
contracts/POs/JOs, MOAs with CHED, DOST, UN and other agencies 
whether public or private agencies together with its supporting documents 
should be submitted to the auditor within five (5) working days upon 
approval of the projects/programs/activities/contracts. Further, it’s 
Financial/Liquidation Reports should have been submitted to the auditor for 
verification within 60 days after the completion of the same as set under the 
MOA. 

The Management commented that they will regularly update the office of 
the auditor with all the contracts/MOAs entered into by the Management. 
 

 
3. MSU-TCTO was not compliant with the Transparency Seal as mandated by 

Section 94 of General Appropriations Act (GAA) for CY 2020 and the 
provisions of Section 93 of GAA 2020 with regards to Transparency of 
Infrastructure Projects due to non-awareness of the Management of the said 



36 
 

provisions that lead to deprivation of information of the stakeholders and/or 
end-users of the University that need transparency and accountability. 

 
Section 94 General Provisions of RA 11465 or the GAA of 2020 defines 

and requires maintenance of Transparency Seal as follows: 
 
Section 94. Transparency Seal. To enhance transparency and 
enforce accountability, all agencies of the government shall 
maintain a Transparency Seal to be posted on their websites. The 
Transparency Seal shall contain the following information:  

 
i. the agency’s mandates and functions, names of its 

officials with their position and designation, and 
contact information;  

ii. approved budgets and corresponding targets, 
immediately upon approval of this Act; 

iii. modifications made pursuant to the general and 
special provisions in this Act; 

iv. annual procurement plan/s and contracts awarded 
with the winning supplier, contractor or consultant;  

v. major activities or projects categorized in accordance 
categorized in accordance with the 0+10 point 
socioeconomic agenda and their target beneficiaries;  

vi. status of implementation, evaluation and/or 
assessment reports of said programs or projects;  

vii. Budget and Financial Accountability Reports;  
viii. People’s Freedom to Information (FOI) Manual 

signed by head of agency, Agency Information 
Inventory, 2018 and 2019 FOI Summary Report, and 
2018 and 2019 FOI Registry; and  

ix. annual reports on the status of income authorized by 
law to be retained or used and be deposited outside of 
the National Treasury which shall include the legal 
basis for its retention and use, the beginning balance, 
income collected and its sources, expenditures, and 
ending balance for the preceding fiscal year. 

 
The heads of the agencies and their web administrators or 

their equivalent shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with 
this Section.” 
 

Moreover, websites should also contain annual reports, as required 
under National Budget Circular Nos. 507 and 507-A dated January 31, 
2007 and June 12, 2007, respectively, for the last three (3) years. 

 



37 
 

Likewise, Section 93 of the aforesaid GAA for the Fiscal Year 2020 on the 
Transparency in Infrastructure Projects provides that: 

“Section 93. Transparency in Infrastructure Projects. All agencies 
of the government shall post the following on their respective 
websites, within the period indicated: 

a) The project title, location and detailed description; 
detailed estimates in arriving at the Approved Budget 
for the Contract; and the winning contractor and the 
detailed estimates of the bid as awarded, within thirty 
(30) calendar days from entering into contract; 

b) Start of construction, target date of completion, 
completion rate, project status, the reason/s in case of 
delay; 

c) Source of fund, implementing office, responsible 
official; contact number and email address; and  

d) The detailed actual cost of the project; and variation 
orders issued, if any, within 30 calendar days from the 
issuance of a certificate of completion. 

The heads of the agencies and web administrators or their 
equivalent shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with this 
Section.” 

The non-compliance of the University with these provisions was due to 
non-awareness of the Management as to the need to post all the required and 
pertinent documents and reports in the website of the University that could lead to 
deprivation of the stakeholders and other third party-users of information of the 
University to know and be informed of the programs/activities and projects and 
other reports of the University. 

We therefore recommended the Management to update the official 
website of the University with information mentioned in Sections 93 and 94 
of GAA 2020 and maintain yearly the update of this information by assigning 
web administrators for these tasks. 

The Management said that they will update the official website of the 
University and follow the recommendation of the auditor. 

 
 
4. The University does not provide at the beginning of the year, their respective 

assigned Supervising Auditors (SAs) and Audit Team Leaders (ATLs) with a 
list of all on-going government projects/programs/activities (PPA) and those 
that are to be implemented during the year and tarpaulins signboards for 
infrastructure projects were not posted or displayed in the project location in 
the manner prescribed in COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 



38 
 

2013, thereby restraining public participation in the promotion of good 
governance through transparency and accountability. 
 

COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 2013 which superseded 
COA Memorandum Nos. 87-492 dated July 27, 1987; 88-49A dated January 6, 
1988; and 98-016 dated June 16, 1998 Information and Publicity on 
Programs/Projects/Activities of Government Agencies, provides on the following 
Sections that: 

Items 2.1 states that “At the beginning of the year, all government 
agencies shall provide their respective assigned SAs and ATLs 
with a list of all on-going government PPA and those that are to be 
implemented during the year. The list shall include the project 
name; implementing unit, office or division if it is not the agency 
as a whole; brief description of the PPA; contractor or supplier, if 
any, mode of procurement; funding source; cost or approved 
budget; project duration including start and completion dates; and 
location. Other information on the PPA may be requested by the 
SA or ATL anytime for audit purposes.” Underscoring supplied 

Item 2.2.1 of the same Circular provides that all government 
agencies, or the implementing unit, office or division as the case 
may be, shall notify the public of their PPA through the posting of 
relevant information detailed in item 2.1 above on signboards, 
blackboards, whiteboards, posters, tarpaulins, streamers, electronic 
boards or similar materials (collectively, “signboards”) not 
exceeding 3 feet by 2 feet, in conspicuous places within the agency 
premises, and in the venue where the PPA is located or carried out. 
This requirement applies to all government PPAs, regardless of 
amount or source of funds. 

Also, Section 2.2.3 of the said Circular requires that “For infrastructure 
projects, a tarpaulin signboard must be suitably framed for outdoor display at the 
project location, and shall be posted as soon as the award has been made. The 
design and format of the tarpaulin, as shown in Annex A of the same circular, 
shall have the following specifications: 

   Tarpaulin, white, 8ft x 8ft 
   Resolution: 70dpi 
   Font: Helvetica 
   Font Size: Main Information – 3” 
   Sub-information – 1” 
   Font Color: Black 
 

Item 2.2.5 further states that “the cost of the public notices referred to 
above shall be charge against the project cost, provided such notices conform to 
the specifications set forth herein.” 



39 
 

Item 3.1 further states that the Head of Agency shall inform its SA and 
ATL within ten (10) days after the award of the infrastructure project or before 
the start of the program/activity that the appropriate project signboards and/or 
public notices are already posted, and the SA and ATL shall validate the same. 

Furthermore, item 3.2 says that, based on the date sourced from the 
monthly monitoring report prepared by the agency and verified by the Technical 
Audit Specialist of COA, the project status in (Annex A or Section 2.2.3) should 
be maintained as current as possible and updated, using the following schedules: 

Contract Duration Frequency of 
Verification 

Interval of Verification                 
(% of Work Accomplished) 

90 days or less 2 times 50% and 100%
91-180 days 3 times 30%, 50% and 100%
181-240 days 4 times 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%
241-360 days 5 times 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%
361-720 days 7 times 15%, 30%, 45%, 60%, 75%, 90% and 

100%
More than 720 days 10 times Every 10%

 
Section 4.0 ibid, Penalty Clause provides that “All expenses incurred in 

violation of this Circular shall be disallowed in audit. Failure of the concerned 
agency or COA officials to comply with any provisions of this Circular shall be 
subject of administrative disciplinary action provided under Section 127 of 
Presidential Decree No. 1445 without prejudice to the filling of a criminal action, 
if warranted by existing laws.” 

Non-submission or non-reporting of Programs, Projects, and Activities at 
the beginning of every year and non-disclosure of complete information on COA 
signboards will deprived the Audit Team the information needed for the conduct 
of evaluation of the completeness and status of completion of projects included in 
the Quarterly PPA Reports, thus, audit of those projects cannot be prepared or 
completed. 

The Audit Team noted that at the beginning of the year the University 
failed to provide the required list of all on-going government PPA and those that 
are to be implemented during the year. Also, the Head of Agency failed to inform 
its SA and ATL within ten (10) days after the award of the infrastructure project 
or before the start of the program/activity that the appropriate project signboards 
and/or public notices are already posted for validation purposes. 

It was also observed that the signboards displayed at project sites were not 
in accordance with sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.3 of the circular such that required 
details and form was not printed and implemented as directed. Ocular inspections 
also of all on-going projects around the campus revealed that none of these 
projects had complied with posting of complete information on COA signboard 



40 
 

especially the percentage of completion per period as mentioned above which 
deprived the public of the information pertaining to government projects. 

Unfamiliarity and disregard of the pertinent laws, rules and regulations, 
and the absence of particular person in charge for reporting and monitoring of all 
PPA may be the possible causes of these management deficiencies. 

With the foregoing observations, in effect the public were deprived of the 
vital information that would promote good governance through transparency and 
accountability; restrained public participation therein; and denied the right of the 
people to information on matters of public. 

We reiterated our recommendations that the Management: 

a) At the beginning of the year, provide the assigned SA and ATL 
with a list of all on-going government PPA and those that are to be 
implemented during the year; 
 

b) Direct the Project Engineers to check/monitor the 
University/contractor’s proper installation of signboards/notices of 
implemented PPA; 
 

c) Inform the Audit Team within ten (10) days after the award of the 
infrastructure project or before the start of the program/activity 
that the appropriate project signboards and/or public notices are 
already posted in order for the Audit Team to validate the same;  
 

d) Post the sign boards and/or public notices in the project location 
as soon as the award of project has been made; and 
 

e) Update the COA tarpauline by indicating its percentage of 
completion every period as required by Section 3.2 of COA 
Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 2013. 

 
The Management commented that it had noted the deficiencies and will 

adopt the recommendations of the auditor. 

 

5. For the CY 2020, contract documents for infrastructure projects with all of 
its supporting documents and purchase orders issued for supplies and 
materials were still not furnished to the Auditor’s office within five (5) 
working days from the date the contract was perfected and purchase orders 
were issued in violation of the provisions of Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1, 
respectively of COA Circular No. 2009-001, resulting to delay of the Auditor 
in conducting review and in informing Management of defects/deficiencies, if 
any and delay in informing the  Technical Audit Specialist (TAS) assigned in 
the auditing unit/cluster or to the Regional Technical Services Office 



41 
 

(RTSO), as the case may be, for inspection so that 100% completed project 
could be turnover by the contractor and accepted by the Management. 

It was observed that the Management incurred deficiencies on the 
submission of contract documents for infrastructure projects for the CY 2020,

COA Circular No. 2009-01 dated February 12, 2009 prescribes the 

submission of copy of government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting 
documents to the COA. The circular shall cover all contracts, purchase orders and 
the like, entered into by any government agency irrespective of amount involved. 

 
3.1.1 Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract 
by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or 
instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled 
corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and 
each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or 
incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency 
concerned. In case of agencies audited on an engagement basis, 
submission of a copy of the contract and its supporting documents 
shall be to the Auditor of the mother agency or parent company, as 
the case may be. Underscoring supplied 



43 
 

3.1.2. The copies of documents required to be submitted shall 
include but not limited to the following: 

 
a. Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid; 
b. Letter of Intent; 
c. Eligibility Documents and Eligibility Data Sheet; 
d. Eligibility Requirements; 
e. Results of Eligibility Check/Screening; 
f. Bidding Documents (Sec. 17.1, IRR-A, RA 9184); 
g. Minutes of Pre-bid Conference, if applicable; 
h. Agenda and/or Supplemental Bid Bulletins, if any; 
i. Bidders Technical and Financial Proposals; 
j. Minutes of Bid Opening; 
k. Abstract of Bids; 
l. Post Qualification Report of Technical Working Group; 
m. BAC Resolution declaring winning bidder; 
n. Notice of Post Qualification; 
o. BAC Resolution recommending approval; 
p. Notice of Award; 
q. Contract Agreement; 
r. Performance Security; 
s. Program of Work and Detailed Estimates; 
t. Certificate of Availability of Funds, Obligation Request; 
u. Notice to Proceed 
v. Such other documents peculiar to the contract and/or to the 

mode of procurement and considered necessary in the 
auditorial review and in the technical evaluation thereof 
such as but not limited to Complete Plan of the project 

 
3.1.3 For technical review purposes, submission of contracts and 

their supporting documents shall furthermore be guided by 
the specific documentary requirements outlined in the 
attached checklist marked as Annexes “A” to “T” of this 
circular. 

 
3.2.1 A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and 

each and every supporting document, shall, within five (5) 
working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the 
Auditor concerned. Within the same period, the Auditor shall 
review and point out to management defects and/or 
deficiencies, if any, in the same manner provided in the 
second and third sentences of item 3.1.4 hereof. 

 
3.2.2 In case of doubt as to the reasonableness of the price of the 

items purchased, the Auditor shall conduct a canvass thereof 
making use of price references provided, among others, by 



44 
 

legitimate suppliers, the Procurement Service, the Technical 
Services Office, other government agencies with similar 
procurement and those posted in the internet. 

 
Moreover, failure on the part of the officials and employees to comply 

with the said ruling shall be penalized as stated under the Section 4 of the same 
Circular which states that: 
 

4.0 PENALTY CLAUSE 
 
4.1   Any unjustified failure of the officials and employees 

concerned to comply with the requirements herein 
imposed shall be subject to the administrative disciplinary 
action provided in (a) Section 127 of Presidential Decree 
No. 1445; (b) Section 55, Title I-B, Book V of the Revised 
Administrative Code of 1987; and (c) Section 11 of 
Republic Act No. 6713. 

 
4.2  Upon receipt of information or discovery by the auditor of 

such failure by management to comply with the required 
submission, an Audit Observation Memorandum shall be 
issued by him calling the attention of the latter, and 
requesting compliance, else the transactions covered by 
the unsubmitted documents be suspended in audit and the 
penalty prescribed by law under 4.1 be enforced. 

 
These infrastructure projects with 100% completion were already 

awarded, mobilizations and progress billings have been paid and yet, from the 
planning stages up to the implementation, information pertaining to these projects 
that required verification/validation by COA was not submitted. Also, not a single 
document pertaining to these projects such as original copies of the contracts and 
other bidding documents has reached the Auditor’s Office contrary to COA 
Circular No. 2009-001 which requires submission of said documents within 5 
working days from execution of the contract to the Auditor of the agency 
concerned. This issue has been the habitual practice of Management. Thus, 
verification/validation of the projects such as auditorial, legal and technical 
review was not conducted.  

 
Based on the inquiry and observation of the Auditor, the reason for non-

submission is the lack of awareness, lax interpretation and implementation of the 
Management of the requirements of the above-mentioned COA Circular No. 
2009-001 since focus was made only on the requirements provided for in Revised 
IRR of RA 9184 otherwise known as the Government Procurement Reform Act.  

 
As a result, the Audit Team was not able to undertake auditorial and legal 

review of the contract in the evaluation of compliance with the requirements of 



45 
 

applicable laws, rules, and regulations, completeness of documentary 
requirements and an initial evaluation of the contractual covenants that should not 
be disadvantageous to the government. This would also delay the communication 
to Management of any information or deficiencies noted in the review, if any and 
delay in informing the TAS assigned in the auditing unit/cluster or to the RTSO, 
as the case may be, for inspection so that 100% completed project could be 
properly turnovered by the contractor and accepted by the Management. 

 
We reiterated our recommendations that Management should: 

 
a) Require the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) to expedite the 

submission of the 2020 approved contracts and strictly ensure that 
they are supported with complete documentation/attachment; 

 
b) Regularly submit within five (5) working days from the execution 

of the contract the contract documents together with all of its 
supporting documents and purchase orders for supplies and 
materials for current and succeeding years; and 

 
c) Require the concerned personnel to revisit the pertinent rules and 

regulations such as COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 
12, 2009. 

 
The Management commented that it had submitted the previous years’ 

contract documents to the office of the auditor and in fact requested for the final 
inspection of all completed contracts with the same office. Also, BAC Secretariat 
wasn’t aware that even PPAs under negotiated procurement must be submitted 
also to the office. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder:  
 

The received request for inspection by the Management was denied by the 
Office of the Auditor because the documents submitted were not complete and/or 
not arranged in the manner prescribed in the IRR of the Revised RA 9184 and as 
illustrated in COA Circular No. 2009-001. The team encountered difficulty in 
arranging and completing all the required documents for inspection. The Audit 
Team therefore recommends completing all the required documents so that final 
inspection by the TSO Regional Office can be actualized. 

 
 

6. Failure to prepare and submit Annual Procurement Plan (APP) and Project 
Procurement Management Plan (PPMP) for CY 2020, thereby affecting the 
evaluation of the legality and propriety of the audited procured goods and 
infrastructure projects in violation of Section 7 (Procurement Planning and 
Budget Linkage), Rule II (Procurement Planning) of the revised IRR of RA 
9184 otherwise known as the Government Procurement Reform Act. 



46 
 

Section 7 (Procurement Planning and Budget Linkage), Rule II 
(Procurement Planning) of the revised IRR of RA 9184 mandates the preparation 
of the APP together with the PPMP. 

 
Section 7.1 ibid provides “that all procurement shall be within the 

approved budget of the Procuring Entity and should be meticulously and 
judiciously planned by the Procuring Entity. Consistent with government fiscal 
discipline measures, only those considered crucial to the efficient discharge of 
governmental functions shall be included in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP). 
For purposes of this IRR, a procurement project shall be considered crucial to the 
efficient discharge of governmental functions if it is required for the day-to-day 
operations or is in pursuit of the principal mandate of the Procuring Entity 
concerned. The APP shall include provisions for foreseeable emergencies based 
on historical records. In the case of Infrastructure Projects, the APP shall 
consider the appropriate timing/phasing of related project activities, such as, 
engineering design and acquisition of right-of-way site or location, to 
reduce/lower project costs.” 

 
Section 7.2 ibid requires “that No procurement shall be undertaken unless 

it is in accordance with the approved APP, including approved changes thereto. 
The APP must be consistent with the duly approved yearly budget of the 
Procuring Entity and shall bear the approval of the HoPE or second-ranking 
official designated by the HoPE to act on his behalf.” 

 
Section 7.3 ibid said that the APP shall be formulated and revised only in 

accordance with the following guidelines: 
 

1. Upon issuance of the budget call, the Procuring Entity shall 
prepare its indicative APP for the succeeding calendar year to 
support its proposed budget taking into consideration the 
budget framework for that year in order to reflect its priorities 
and objectives. 

2. In the preparation of the indicative APP, the end-user or 
implementing units of the procuring entity shall formulate their 
Project Procurement Management Plans (PPMPs) for their 
different programs, activities and projects (PAPs). 

3. The PPMP shall then be submitted to the Procuring Entity’s 
Budget Office for evaluation in order to ensure consistency 
with the Procuring Entity’s budget proposal and compliance 
with existing budgeting rules. The PPMPs included in the 
budget proposal shall be forwarded to the BAC Secretariat for 
the consolidation into an indicative APP, and to the BAC for 
final recommendation of the appropriate procurement 
modality. For this purpose, the indicative APP shall include the 
following: 



47 
 

a) Name of Procurement Project; 

b) Procurement Management Office (PMO)/end 
user/implementing unit; 

c) Method of Procurement; 

d) Schedule of identified procurement activities as 
reflected in the APP form approved by the GPPB 

e) Source of funds 

f) Indicative ABC; and 

g) Other relevant descriptions of the project, if 
applicable. 

The indicative APP and budget proposal shall be 
simultaneously submitted to the HOPE and/or other oversight 
bodies for approval. 

 
4. As soon as the General Appropriations Act becomes final, the 

end user or implementing units shall revise and adjust the 
PPMPs to reflect the budgetary allocation for their respective 
PAPs. The revised PPMPs shall be submitted to the BAC, 
through its secretariat, for the recommendation of the methods 
of procurement. The indicative APP shall then be revised and 
approved in accordance with the duly approved yearly budget 
of the Procuring Entity and shall bear the approval of the 
HOPE or second-ranking official designated by the HOPE to 
act on his behalf.  

On the other hand, Section 22 (b) of CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, 
Series of 2011 states that all budget proposals for maintenance and other 
operating expenses requiring procurement shall be covered by an APP and PPMP 
duly signed by the deans, executive directors, fiduciary and IGP/Production fund 
administrators, and the President, and submitted for approval to BOR/T. This 
requirement and all other mandatory requirement under RA 9184 shall be 
observed strictly to maximize the use of financial and material resources. 

 
Every year thru this Annual Audit Report, the BAC Secretariat was 

requested to submit a copy of the APP together with the PPMP for all funds for 
CY 2020, but was not able to provide such which precluded the Audit Team to 
ascertain among others, the following: 

 
1. That the APP if there was any, was prepared in accordance with the 

pertinent provisions of IRR of RA 9184; 
2. That all procured items were included in the approved APP; 



48 
 

3. That the APP for all funds was reflective of duly approved PPMPs of 
different end-users or implementing units; and that 

4. All items included in the APP were crucial or necessary in the 
operations of the agency. 

 
APP is the requisite document that the agency must prepare to reflect the 

necessary information on the entire procurement activities for goods and services 
and infrastructures to be procured that it plans to undertake within the calendar 
year. The APP comprises the consolidated PPMP. APP must include only plan 
procurement activities for Common–use Supplies and Equipment (APP-CSE), 
Infrastructure Projects and other procured items that is considered crucial to the to 
the efficient discharge of government function. All Procurement shall be within 
the approved APP of the Agency’s projects/programs.  

 
Verification as to the reasons of non-submission of APP shows that 

various Units/Departments of the University failed to submit to the BAC 
Secretariat its PPMP on time; thus, such non-submission of PPMP which shall 
serve as the basis of the production of APP makes it impossible to consolidate all 
items to produce APP. 

 
The non-preparation and submission of APP in accordance with the 

revised IRR of RA 9184 following the format approved by GPPB casted doubt as 
to economy and efficiency in the procurement process as well as the legality and 
propriety of the procured items. In effect, it also lost the opportunity to avail of 
volume discounts inherent in bulk purchasing which will redound to savings for 
the University. Also, non-submission of APP for Common-use Supplies and 
Equipment is contrary to DBM Circular Letter No. 2011-06 and 2011-06A, thus, 
will result to possible exclusion of its 2020 projected procurement activities from 
the consolidated APP-CSE for government, and effect preventing PS-DBM from 
accomplishing its mandated function of projecting inventory requirements and the 
overall Management of the government’s central procurement of common-use 
supplies. 

 
We reiterated our recommendations that the University prepare a 

meticulous and judicious PPMP and consolidate it properly to produce APP 
for all funds in compliance with Section 7 of the Republic Act No. 9184 
otherwise known as the Government Procurement Reform Act and as 
required under DBM Circular Letter No. 2011-06 and 2011-06A.  

 
The Management commented that it is experiencing difficulty in the 

consolidation of all PPMPs of every department including community high 
schools situated in different islands of Tawi-Tawi. But the Management will 
submit PPAs regularly thereafter. 

7. The University failed to submit sufficient data of its Updated Agency 
Personnel Profile (plantilla of personnel) as of December 31, 2020 contrary to 
Section 122 of PD 1445. The inability of the Personnel Division to submit the 



49 
 

current plantilla of personnel casted doubt as to the legality, propriety and 
appropriateness of the amount charged in the Personnel Services. 

PD 1445, otherwise known as the State Audit Code of the Philippines, 
provides among others the following:  

 
Section 122. Submission of Reports. whenever deemed necessary 
in the exigencies of the service, the commission may under 
regulations issued by it require the agency heads, chief 
accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, 
administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials 
of the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory 
reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as 
may be necessary for the exercise of its functions. 
 

(2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the 
documents and reports mentioned herein shall 
automatically cause the suspension of payment of their 
salaries until they shall have complied with the 
requirements of the commission 

 
(3) No appropriation authorized in the General Appropriations 

act shall be available to pay the salary of any official or 
employee who violates the provisions of this section, 
without prejudice to any disciplinary action that may be 
instituted against such official or employee.”  

  
We required the Management to submit the Agency Plantilla of Personnel 

every year through this Annual Audit Report which would be our basis in 
ascertaining that the positions of employees whose salaries and wages are being 
charged in the Personnel Services are included in the plantilla of personnel 
prepared by the agency and approved by the Compensation and Position 
Classification Bureau (CPCB) of the Department of Budget and Management and 
that the amounts they are receiving  are within budget appropriated for their 
positions, these are among the basic requirements provided by Section 191, 
Volume I of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM) for the 
payment salaries and wages. But despite our written requests, the Management 
failed to provide sufficient appropriate data of the said report. 

 
We further noted that copies of appointments of newly hired and promoted 

as well as the renewed contract of services were not furnished to this office. These 
documents are needed in the audit as provided for in COA Circular No. 2012-001 
dated June 14, 2012 prescribing the Revised Guidelines and Documentary 
Requirement for Common Government Transactions which requires those 
documents for the payment of salary of newly hired, promoted as well as renewed 
contract of service employees. 

 



50 
 

The inability of the Personnel Division to submit the updated current 
plantilla of personnel casted doubt as to the legality, propriety and appropriateness 
of the amount charged in the Personnel Services. In effect, the non-submission 
thereof deprives the Audit Team to conduct proper comparison and review of the 
pertaining disbursement vouchers under the Personnel Services account viz-a-viz 
Plantilla of Personnel. 

 
We recommended that the Management should instruct the HRMO 

Department to submit current plantilla of personnel every year and furnish 
the Audit Team copies of agency personnel movements (i.e. approved 
appointment/contract of service of every newly hired, promoted as well as the 
newly renewed contract) beforehand. 

 
The Management had no comment on this. 

 
 

8. Sending officials and employees to seminar/s trainings sponsored by non-
COA accredited private and non-government organizational training 
institutions violated PD 1445 Sections 17 and 32 and COA Circular No. 95-
008 dated September 7, 1995, caused the incurrence of irregular traveling 
expenses resulting to wastage of funds. 
 

PD 1445 provides among others the following: 
 
Section 17. The Manpower Development Office. The Manpower 
Development Office shall perform the following functions:  

  
(1) Formulate long-range plans for a comprehensive training 

program for all personnel of the Commission and personnel 
of the agencies of government, with respect to Commission 
rules and regulations and audit matters;   

(2) Prepare and implement annual training programs, consistent 
with its long-range plans;  

(3) Develop its capability to implement training programs;  
(4) Set up and maintain a library for the Commission; and   
(5) Publish the professional journal of the Commission.  
  

Section 32.  Government contracts for auditing, accounting, and related 
services.   
  
(1)  No government agency shall enter into any contract with any 

private person or firm for services to undertake studies and 
services relating to government auditing, including services to 
conduct, for a fee, seminars or workshops for government 
personnel on these topics, unless the proposed contract is first 
submitted to the Commission to enable it to determine if it has 



51 
 

the resources to undertake such studies or services.  The 
Commission may engage the services of experts from the 
public or private sector in the conduct of these studies.  

  
(2)  Should the Commission decide not to undertake the study or 

service, it shall nonetheless have the power to review the 
contract in order to determine the reasonableness of its costs.  

 
We also invited the Management to read the COA Circular No. 95-008 re: 

Attendance by Government Personnel to and Accreditation of the Training 
Programs on Government Accounting and Auditing Courses Conducted by the 
Human Technology Development Center (HTDC) and Other Non-COA Training 
Institutions which quoted the letter dated February 8, 1995 of Chairman Patricia 
A. Sto. Tomas of Civil Service Commission emphasizing the importance of 
accrediting private training institutions by the Commission to better respond to 
the development needs of people in government which was set forth by the 
Commission, to  wit: 

 
“In this connection, it is reminded that it is the State Accounting 
and Auditing Development Office (SAADO) that has authority "to 
formulate long-range plans for a comprehensive training program 
for all personnel of the Commission and personnel of the agencies 
of government, with respect to the COA's rules and regulations 
and audit matters" Section 17 (1), PD 1445 and pursuant to the 
Restructuring and Organization and Redefinition of the functions 
of the COA under Executive Order No. 19 dated June 19, 1986. It 
must be emphasized, in this connection, that this power is just the 
realization of the constitutional mandate giving the COA 
"exclusive authority x x x to promulgate accounting and auditing 
rules and regulations, x x x " (Article IX (A), Section 2 (2), 
Philippine Constitution) with SAADO as its training arm.  
 
However, in view of sheer volume, SAADO and its training arms 
cannot meet the training needs of all government personnel. For 
this reason, other training institutions may be allowed to train them 
after proper accreditation by this Commission.  
 
Accreditation of training programs on government accounting and 
government auditing shall be given to requesting training 
institutions upon submission to and review by the SAADO of the 
following requirements:  
 

1. Course design to include syllabus, topical outline, course 
objectives and reference materials, if any.  

2. List of resource persons and their Personal Data Sheets. 
Criteria for accepting resource persons follow:  



52 
 

  
a) Resource persons for Government Auditing must be 

COA Auditors who have been trained in COA auditing 
classes/courses or who are already acting as trainors 
and authorized by their respective Directors and the 
COA Chairman;  

b) Resource persons for Government Accounting must be 
COA auditors who have attended or are already trainors 
in COA government accounting courses and authorized 
by their respective Directors and the COA Chairman. 
Those who are not COA auditors must have been 
trained in Government Accounting by the COA;  

c) Resource persons for Internal Auditing who are COA 
auditors must have been trained in Internal Control by 
the COA; for those who are not from the Commission, 
they must have been attended the Internal Auditing 
course conducted by the Association of Government 
Internal Auditors (AGIA).  

  
3. Seminar/training fees. These must be reasonable and in 

accordance with regulations pertaining to the prevention of 
excessive, extravagant and unconscionable expenditures on 
uses of government funds and properties. Specifically, they 
should refrain from holding their seminars in five-star 
hotels or similar expensive venues.  

 
Henceforth, all non-COA government personnel may attend 
courses on government accounting and auditing outside the 
SAADO if conducted by duly accredited training institutions. 

 
Post audit of disbursement documents revealed that several transactions 

charged to traveling expenses account includes seminars/training to non-COA 
Accredited private and non-government organizational training institutions. This 
was found to be due to non-awareness of the University of the prohibition set by 
the above mentioned laws that may result to audit disallowance of such 
transactions. 

 
We recommended to the Management to stop sending off officials and 

employees to seminars/ trainings to non-COA Accredited private and non-
government organizational training institutions to avoid irregular traveling 
expenses and in pursuance to COA Circular No. 95-008 datde September 7, 
1995 and PD 1445 Section 32. 

 
The Management had no comment on this. 

 



53 
 

9. Non-maintenance of Cash Receipts Record (CRR), Cash Disbursement 
Record (CDR), Check Disbursement Record (CkDR) or their equivalents, 
such as Cash Receipts Register (CRR), Petty Cash Register (PCR), and Cash 
Disbursements Register (CDR) by the Accountable Officers contrary to 
Revised Cash Examination Manual as prescribed by COA Memorandum No. 
2013-004 dated July 9, 2013.  

   
The Accountable Officer (AO) shall maintain his 

cashbook/CRR/CDR/CkDR and such other records or their equivalents as may be 
prescribed by the agency’s operating procedures, and reconcile with the 
accounting records, at least quarterly, unless the agency required a more frequent 
reconciliation (Sec. 38-40, MNGAS, Vol. II, for NGAs; and Sec. 26-28, MNGAS, 
Vol. II, for LGUs).  

 
The following book, records and registers are encouraged as indicated in 

the Page 3, Chapter I of the Revised Cash Examination Manual:

2004-003, June 24, 2004; Supplemental Form Prescribed 
Under COA Circular No. 2003-006 dated December 2, 2003 
Re: Use of Simplified Accounting Forms for Financial 
Transactions of Government Units Without Complete Set of 
Books of Accounts). 

 
The AO maintained the cashbooks and submitted the same to the Office of 

the Auditor. However, although the maintenance of such cashbooks for each 
account is accepted, it was observed that the cashbooks being used by the 
University is lacking the complete data or information needed in the proper 
accounting and auditing of related cash accounts. Also, transactions will be 
hampered considering that the accountable officer concern will spend most of her 
time in completing needed lacking data in the cashbooks and checkbooks, 
whenever necessary.  Also, failure to record cancelled checks and debit and credit 
memos makes the balances on the checkbooks incorrect that may result to 
erroneous Cash-in-Bank balances once not adjusted/corrected immediately. 
Hence, the maintenance of the cashbook, records and registers listed above as 
found in the Volume II of the GAM has the most information needed for 
accounting and auditing is encouraged. 



55 
 

We recommended the Management to instruct the Accountable 
Officer to (a) maintain the records and registers as cited under the Revised 
Cash Examination Manual and as presented in the Volume II of the GAM 
for more effective and efficient monitoring and control of funds and for 
proper accounting and auditing of related accounts thereafter in lieu of the 
cashbooks being maintained; and (b) to record all transactions of cash in 
bank including receipts and issuances of checks, record cancelled checks and 
debit and credit memos in the checkbooks.   

 
 The Management commented that it had already prepared the Bank 
Cashbook and will try to comply with the recommendations of the Auditor to 
prepare the required records/registers. 
 

10. Department Heads were performing disbursing functions contrary to the 
provisions of Section 50, Volume III of the GAAM giving them the 
opportunity to authorize, purchase and liquidate on their own, that can help 
them conceal errors and irregularities which may result to possible loss or 
misappropriation of government funds.   

Section 50, Volume III of the GAAM on the segregation of duties and 
functions states that: 

 
Key duties and functions such as authorization, custody and accounting 

shall be assigned to separate offices and individuals to eliminate opportunities to 
conceal errors or irregularities. 

 
To ensure the effective check and balance exist and to prevent any one 

employee from perpetrating or concealing irregularities or illegal acts alone, no 
one person or department should be in complete control over a transaction.  

 
The person responsible for an error cannot be expexted to report its 

occurrence. Consequently, significant phases of transactions should be identified 
and each phase assigned to a different person. In this way, the work of one 
provides an automatic check on the work of another. 

 
On a company-wide basis, it is suggested that the following functions and 

responsibilities be separated or performed by different employees/departments to 
avoid giving any office or individual inordinate control over transactions and 
resources. 
 

1. Transaction authorzation (a management function) 
2. Transaction execution (a custodial function) 
3. Transaction recording (an accounting function) 
4. Periodic accountability (an internal audit function) 
 
As a result of this combined functions the risk of the money being the 

most susceptible to risk of fraud is greater, since the requesting unit was also 



56 
 

assigned disbursing functions and can use the money in his/her custody to 
purchase any items and conceal it using the power as the authorizing officer. 

 
Fidelity bond on the BTr is required under COA Circular No. 2006-005 

dated July 13, 2006 amendment to item 7.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated 
February 10, 1997 on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances, 
which states that: 

 
In order to be attuned with times and to rationalize the requirement on the 

posting of fidelity bond by accountable officers to realistic levels, Item 7.1 of 
COA Circular no. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 is hereby amended to read as: 

 
“7.1. Each accountable officer whose total cash accountability is 
not less than P5,000.00 shall be bonded. The amount of bond shall 
depend on the total accountability of the officer as fixed by the 
Head of the Agency. An official or employee who has both money 
and property accountability shall be bonded only once to cover 
both accountabilities, but the amount of bond shall be in 
accordance with the Schedule issued by the Bureau of Treasury.” 
 
 Furthermore, the purpose of Fidelity Fund was mentioned in the Cash 

Examinantion Manual and COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, to 
wit: 
 

1. The Fidelity Fund shall be available for the purpose of 
replacing defalcations, shortages, unrelieved losses in the 
accounts of bonded public officers, for the payment of fees 
and costs incident to civil proceedings brought against them to 
recover sums paid on their account from said Fund.  
 

2. The relief from accountability of the accountable public 
officer granted by the COA shall relieve the agency from 
responsibility for the loss or damage to public funds or 
property. 
 

3. When no relief of accountability is granted by the COA, the 
agency concerned may file claim for reimbursement from the 
Fidelity Fund to the extent of the approved bond covered or 
amount of loss whichever is lower. 
 

4. Any and all claims against the Fidelity Fund shall be filed as a 
money claim with the COA, with a copy to the BTr together 
with the evidence relating thereto. Claims approved by the 
COA shall constitute a legal claim against the Fidelity Fund. 

 



57 
 

Per record, requesting units like department heads have been granted 
several cash advances and were allowed to perform the disbursing functions 
which gave them the opportunity to authorize, purchase and liquidate on their 
own. This set-up is in inconsistent with the rationale of the segregation of duties 
and functions since errors and irregularities may occur and be concealed which 
may result to possible loss or misappropriation of government funds; hence 
contrary to Section 50, Volume III of the GAAM. 

 
 It was revealed that the Management thought that in order to be granted 

cash advances, what is required other than the supportingofficial travel documents 
is the fidelity bond from the Bureau of Treasury only.  

 
 Though there were no shortages or losses of funds noted after the 

cash  examination of the Audit Team, we recommended to Management that: 
 

a) Requesting units like department heads should no longer be 
allowed to do disbursing functions to eliminate opportunities to 
conceal errors and irregularities; 

 
b) Only disbursing officers and Special Disbursing Officer are 

allowed Cash Advances other than travel as this are their sole 
purpose; and 

 
c) Implement Section 50, Volume III of the GAAM regarding the 

separation of functions and duties to eliminate opportunities to 
conceal errors and fraud. 

 
The Management commented that it will adopt the recommendations of 

the auditor. 
 
11. Non-notification of transfer of accounts from Accountable Officer (AO) to 

succeeding AO resulting to no proper turn-over of cash accountability 
between AOs contrary to Sections 75, 77, and 122 of PD 1445 or the State 
Audit Code of the Philippines due to unawareness of the Management with 
the stated provisions that will lead to possible losses and errors in the 
accountability of the former and new AO.  

In the course of our conduct of cash examination we found out that Ms. 
Zenaida Annudin is currently assigned under the Office of the Director for Budget 
and Finance and was replaced by Mr. Suaib Yusop as head cashier but the 
Management failed to properly inform the Audit Team about the 
change/replacement of accountable officer contrary to State Audit Code of the 
Philippines other wise Known as PD 1445 Section 75, 77 and 122. 

 
 

PD 1445 states on the following Sections that: 
 



58 
 

Section 75. Transfer of funds from one officer to another.  Transfer 
of government funds from one officer to another shall, except as 
allowed by law or regulation, be made only upon prior direction or 
authorization of the Commission or its representative.  
  
Section 77. Invoice and receipt upon transfer of funds or property.  
When government funds or property are transferred from one 
accountable officer to another, or from an outgoing officer to his 
successor, it shall be done  upon properly itemized invoice and 
receipt which shall invariably support the clearance to be issued to 
the relieved or out-going officer, subject to regulations of the 
Commission. 
 
Section 122. Submission of reports.  Whenever deemed necessary 
in the exigencies of the service, the Commission may under 
regulations issued by it require the agency heads, chief 
accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, 
administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials 
of the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory 
reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as 
may be necessary for the exercise of its functions.  
  

(2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the 
documents and reports mentioned herein shall 
automatically cause the suspension of payment of their 
salaries until they shall have complied with the 
requirements of the Commission.  

  
(3) No appropriation authorized in the General Appropriations 

Act shall be available to pay the salary or any official or 
employee who violates the provisions  of this section, 
without prejudice to any disciplinary  action that may be 
instituted against such official or employee. 

 
 

Replacement of accountable officer not only includes change of individual 
performing disbursing functions  but also transfer of any unliquidated cash 
advances to BTr or another accountable officer and transfer of property like 
accountable forms with/or without money value with the presence of COA 
representative as required by Sections 74 and 77 of PD 1445. Lack of presence of 
COA representative on the transfer of funds and property from one AO to another 
may result to release of accountability of former AO of its unsettled accounts, if 
any and will also result to possible losses and errors of accountabilities of the new 
AO. 

 
 We recommended that the Management: 



59 
 

 
a) Inform the Audit Team about the changes of position of every 

official and employees of the agency especially the accountable 
officers as these are very crucial in the audit of their accounts and 
giving of clearances upon retirement; and 

 
b) Strictly comply with the provisions Sections 75, 77 and 102 of PD 

1445. 
 

The Management commented to adhere strictly with the recommendations 
stated. 

B. Others 

 
Gender and Development (GAD) Plan and Program 
 
12. The MSU-TCTO, MSU-TCTO conducted various activities and practiced 

implementation of GAD programs spearheaded by the GAD Focal Person of the 
University. The University has also adopted the GAD Focal Point System with 
their GAD Projects supportive of gender issues. Below are the University GAD 
Budget and the actual utilization of budget for CY 2020: 
 

 

We recommended that the Management continue to implement GAD 
Programs and Activities in accordance with PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular 
No. 2012-01 Guidelines for the Preparation of Annual GAD Plans and Budgets 
and Accomplishment Reports to Implement the Magna Carta for Women as to

390 dated November 11, 1992, thus, exposing these properties to risk of not being 
indemnified for any damage or loss due to any fortuitous event such as fire, 
earthquake, typhoon and/or flood. 

 
Item 1.1.2 of COA Circular No. 92-390 dated November 17, 1992 

Inventory of Physical Assets, Insurance and Bonding of Risks with the General 
Insurance Fund of the GSIS provides that: 

 
“xxx All insurable assets and properties of the government are 
adequately covered/insured with the General Insurance Fund of 
the GSIS xxx.” 

 
Item 3.1 of the same Circular provides that: 

 
 “All heads of national agencies, local government units and 
Government-owned or controlled corporations shall be 
responsible for the preparation and submission of the inventory of 
all insurable physical assets. xxx” 

 
All insurable properties of the Agency must be covered with the 

appropriate property insurance with the Government Service Insurance System 
(GSIS) in order to indemnify or compensate the Agency for any damage to, or 
loss of, its properties due to fire, earthquake, storm, or other casualty. 

 
Verification of the University’s PPE disclosed that insurable assets 

particularly its buildings and other structures are at risk of loss without 
indemnification in case of fire or other fortuitous event because they were not 
insured with the property insurance with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS. 

 
This observation appeared in Annual Audit Report (AAR) for CY 2019 

and is still not complied as of to date. 

We recommended that the University adhere to the provisions of 
COA Circular No. 92-390 dated November 17, 1992. 

 
The Management is in the process of completing the requirements needed 

for an infrastructure to be insured especially the land title.

There was a laxity by 
the management in the 
enforcement of 
collections of 
receivables and 
payment of liabilities 
which resulted to the

liabilities amounting to 
P13,619,111.17 and 
P8,427,780.35 
respectively, which

4. Comply with the provisions 
of Section 111 of PD 1445 
paragraphs 1 and 2 as 
regards to recording of 
accounts; 
 

5. Undertake more aggressive 
measures that will facilitate 
the collection of these long 
outstanding past due 
receivables such as sending 
letter reminders, conduct of 
house to house collection 
campaign among delinquent 
borrowers, and if warranted, 
avail of civil remedies for 
the collection of these 
accounts. 
 

6. Secure complete documents 
to support the claims against 
the agency as required under 
Section 4 Paragraph 6 of PD 
1445 and intensify its efforts 
to pay all of the liabilities 
with complete 
documentations.

Significant delay in the 
implementation of the 
various projects which 
deprived the end-users 
of the benefits due them 
on time in violation of 
Section 17.6 of the IRR 
of RA 9184 and 
Contract Agreement 
signed by between the

Suppliers or 
Contractors. 
 

We recommended that 
management should: 
 

18. If the delay cannot be validly 
justified and if found out that 
fault is on the management 
personnel, like if they have 
violated Section 17.6 of the 
Revised IRR of RA 9184, 
such concerned personnel 
should be subjected to 
appropriate action, but if it is 
contractors’ fault, then 
liquidated damages should 
be imposed upon the latter 
based on the Annex E 
(Liquidated Damages) of RA 
9184 “Contract 
Implementation Guidelines 
for the Procurement of 
Infrastructure Projects” and 
consider it as a ground for 
disqualifying the 
contractor/s in participating 
in the future bidding 
activities of the University. 
 

19. Exert more efforts to finish 
the remaining uncompleted 
projects by requiring the 
contractors or suppliers to 
provide catch up plan and 
strictly implement such.
