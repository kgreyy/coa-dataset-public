	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

	

	A.  Introduction

	

The University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) is a regional state university created in 1978 by virtue of Batas Pambansa Bilang 12. USeP became operational in 1979 by integrating the Mindanao State University in Mintal, Davao City (MSU-Davao), the University of the Philippines Master of Management in Davao (UPMMPD), the Davao School of Arts and Trades (DSAT), and the Davao National Regional Agricultural School (DNRAS).



The University has five campuses, namely: Obrero and Mintal Campuses both in Davao City, Tagum Campus in Apokon, Tagum City, the Mabini Campus in Mabini, Davao de Oro, and Bislig Campus, in Bislig City, Surigao del Sur. The central administration is situated in Obrero Campus, Davao City.  The financial transactions of Mabini Campus are recorded in the Tagum Campus’ books of accounts.



The University has 595 approved plantilla positions of which 501 are filled-up as of December 31, 2020, comprising of 136 Non-Teaching and 365 Teaching Personnel.



B. Audit Methodology 



The Commission on Audit has been implementing risk-based audit in the conduct of its audit services.  However, to meet the evolving developments in public governance and fund management, the results-based audit approach was incorporated.  The integration of these two approaches, called the Integrated Results and Risk-Based Audit (IRRBA) Methodology was applied in the audit of the accounts and operations of the University.”



		C. Scope of Audit

		

	A Financial and Compliance audit was conducted on the accounts and operations of the University for calendar year 2020. The audit covered review of operating procedures, evaluation of the University’s programs and projects, interview of concerned government officials and employees, verification, reconciliation, analysis of accounts and such other procedures considered necessary.

	

	D. Financial Highlights

	

D.1 Sources and Applications of Funds

	

	In the implementation of programs, projects and activities, the University has generated sufficient cash derived from grants and donations received from other national agencies intended for the implementation of special projects and the subsidy it received from the national government. The University also derived its income from collection of tuition and other fees that were constituted as Special Trust Fund (164) by virtue of RA 8292.

				E. Independent Auditor’s Report



				In our opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the Basis of Qualified Opinion section of our report, the accompanying financial statements present fairly in all materials respects, the financial position of the University of Southeastern Philippines as at December 31, 2020, and its financial performance, its cash flows, and its comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended in accordance with Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSASs).

				

				As discussed in Part II of this Report, The Plant Property and Equipment (PPE) balances of Obrero and Tagum Campuses in the total amount of P997,908,885.11 could not be relied upon since it does not reconcile with their Report of Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) amounting to P983,388,520.87 resulting in the difference of P60,869,444.12 due to over and under statements or net amount of P14,520,354.24. And in Part III, the balance of Accounts Receivable of P69,010,215.35 could not be relied upon due to the inaccurate computation of Allowance for Impairment amounting to P1.6M does not provide for the correct age of receivables on a per student basis.   Likewise, the University was not able to fully comply with IPSAS 27-Agriculture as to the measurement and disclosure requirements of the Biological Assets totaling P3.05M.    



We conduct our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs).  Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.  We are independent of the agency in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified opinion.



F.  Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations

	

	The significant audit observations and recommendations for the year 2020, which were duly discussed with concerned USeP management officials on February 23, 2021 are summarized as follows:

		

1)	The Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account balance of  P997,908,885.11 does not reconcile with the balance per Report of Physical Count of PPE amounting P983,388,520.87 resulting in the difference of P60,869,444.12 due to over and under statements or net amount of P14,520,354.24 for  failure of the Accounting and Supply Management Unit to regularly reconcile their record, contrary to Government Accounting Manual (GAM), and Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM), Volume III, thus, existence, accuracy and reliability of the balances of PPE accounts in the financial statements cannot be ascertained. 



Require the Accountants and the Heads of the Supply Units of Obrero and Tagum campuses to reconcile their records so that the balances of their PPE accounts can be relied upon.



2)	Weak internal controls and procedures for online collections and deposits by the USEP clienteles were not properly defined and inconsistent with Section 124 of PD 1445, resulting in the delayed issuance of Official Receipts and difficulty in matching/reconciling the same with the deposits reflected in the bank statements, thus making the financial reports unreliable. 



		We recommended for management to provide a strong internal control to facilitate/ generate real-time reconciliation and early preparation of the Bank Reconciliation Statements.

		

3)		The practice of drawing checks to payees who at the same time were also the signatories to the checks amounting to P123,500.00 contravened Section 124 of PD 1445 and some basic Internal Control policies on Cash Disbursements, thereby giving the signatories undue controls over the disbursement cycle.



We recommended that check signatories refrain from signing checks issued to themselves in order not to weaken the internal control over cash disbursements.



1)	Payment of the CY 2018 Performance-Based Bonus (PBB) in the total amount of P451,146.49 was not in compliance with Memorandum Circular No. 2018-1 on the Grant of PBB  for CY 2018, therefore raising questions whether the grant may have been irregular.



We recommended to stop the practice of paying PBBs to those who are not qualified to receive the same and to require its immediate refund. 



2)	COVID 19 expenses were not in accordance with PD 1445, RA9184, BIR Rules and Regulations, and DBM Circular 2020-1, therefore raising doubts on its propriety.



We recommended to comply with laws, rules and regulations in paying for expenses relating to COVID 19.
