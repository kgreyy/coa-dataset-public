II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



Financial and Compliance



Delayed/non-submission of Financial Reports



All Campuses



1)		Financial and other required reports and records were not submitted within the prescribed period contrary to the applicable provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) and PD 1445, thus hindering the Auditor from performing a timely review and recommending corrective measures if there were defects and/or deficiencies found in audit.

	

a)		Delayed submission of Report of Checks Issued and Report of Collections and Deposits

	

Presidential Decree 1445 or the State Audit Code of the Philippines provide-

	

	Section 100. Reports of disbursing officers in a government agency. Disbursing officers in any government agency shall render monthly reports of their transactions pursuant to regulations of the Commission to be submitted not later than the fifth day of the ensuing month to the auditor . . .



Section 6.05 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 provides: 

            

“The official involved in the daily recording of transactions in the books of accounts shall turn over the receipts and the disbursement records with all paid vouchers and documents evidencing the transactions to the Auditor within ten (10) days from the date of receipt of said documents.” (emphasis supplied)



From the data presented in Table 1 below, it can be gathered that the submission of the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) were delayed from a minimum of 5 days and a maximum of 205 days. This is aside from the non-submission of the same reports by Obrero Campus for the period March, 2020 to September, 2020 and Mintal Campus from February, 2020 to September, 2020.

Please note that Section 7.01 of the same Circular states:



“Unjustified failure on the part of the official or employee concerned to submit the documents and reports mentioned herein shall be considered a ground for the automatic suspension of payment of his salary until he shall have complied with the aforesaid requirements, without prejudice to any disciplinary action that may be instituted against him (Section 122 of P.D. 1445).” (emphasis ours)



Such practice of delayed submission of the said reports hindered the Auditor from verifying the regularity, validity, propriety, accuracy and completeness of agency transactions.



b)	Delayed submission of the Monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements



Presidential Decree 1445 or the State Audit Code of the Philippines provide-

	

“Section 74.  Monthly reports of depositories to agency head. At the close of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head, in such from as he may direct, the condition of the agency account standing on their books. The head of the agency shall see to it that a reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the reports and the balance found in the books of the agency.” (emphasis ours)

	

Chapter 21 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies, Volume I set the general guidelines on the preparation and submission of the Bank Reconciliation Statement, to wit:

	

	Sec. 5. Preparation of the Bank Reconciliation Statement

	

	The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt 

	

	

	of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the GSB, reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the BRS in four copies.” (emphasis ours)

	

Sec. 7. Reporting. 



 The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty days after receipt of the monthly BS to the following: (emphasis ours)

 

	Original – COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents 

	and JEVs)

	Copy 2 – Head of Agency/Entity

	Copy 3 – Accounting Division/Unit file

	Copy 4 – Bank, if necessary”

	

Details on the submission/non-submission of the Bank Reconciliation Statements of the different campuses of their different bank accounts are shown in Table 3.

	NOTE: Due date was pegged at 20 days after the end of each month in consideration of  the real time availability                                                             of  balances  due to the weAccess  facility of the Land Bank and request for screenshots from the DBP.

		

	From Table 3 the following submissions were noted:

	

1)		Obrero Campus -  

	

a)		Fund 101 was only for the month of January 2020 to March 2020 -delayed from 6 to 193 days, April to September, 2020 none was submitted

b)		Fund 164 – STF – none was submitted from January to September, 2020;

c)		Other Funds – January 2020 to June 2020 – delayed from 6 to 187 days,  while none were submitted for the period  July, 2020 to September, 2020

	

2)		Mintal Campus – January 2020 to March 2020 – delayed from 44 to 75 days with no submission for the period April 2020 to September, 2020

	

3)		Tagum Campus- was able to submit their Bank Reconciliation Statements from January, 2020 to May, 2020 – delays from 6 to 118 days.   

	

	However, from June 2020 to August 2020, Tagum Campus was able to submit their Bank Reconciliation Statements ahead of the prescribed deadline and we commend them for this.

	

Such inability to prepare the bank reconciliation statements (BRS) will affect the adequacy of internal controls over cash.  Likewise, this may have an effect on the reliability and fair presentation of the balances in the financial statements since there may be possible book errors or other reconciling items subject to adjustments that are not detected.



It must be noted that the delays or non-submission of the BRS might not be justified by management in view of the current trends in the banking industry of providing to clients the internet banking facilities, like the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) weAccess which provides real time access on the balances of the clients’ deposits, loans and other selected banking transactions.  While screen shots can be availed of from the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP)



In addition, National Guidelines on Internal Control Systems, as circularized in DBM Circular Letter No. 2008-8 dated October 23, 2008, specifically listing reconciliation of financial and non-financial data among the most common control policies and procedures that are part of the coordinated measures and procedures that every office should have: “Operating procedures of every office require that the cash records of the Accounting and Cash units should be regularly reconciled. The records of the depository banks pertaining to the cash accounts of the agency should be reconciled with the records of the Accounting and Cash units. This process will detect errors or fraud either by the bank, the Accounting unit or the Cash unit…” (emphasis ours)

		

Such delay precludes the audit team from ascertaining the accuracy and completeness of recorded cash balances in the agency’s financial statements.

	

c)		Delayed submission of Financial Statements and other Financial Reports

Verification on the agency’s submission of the Trial Balance with Supporting Schedules and the quarterly Financial Statements disclosed that as of October 26, 2020 only the Trial Balance for the months of January and February 2020 were submitted  on 



August 3, 2020, which runs counter to Chapter 19 Financial Reporting, GAM Volume 1 and defeats the purpose of its preparation which are - 

	

“ Sec. 3. Purpose of Financial Statements



a)	Financial statements are a structured representation of the financial position and financial performance of an entity. The objectives of general purpose financial statements are to provide information about the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making and evaluating decisions about the allocation of resources. Specifically, the objectives of general purpose financial reporting in the public sector should be to provide information useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the accountability of the entity for the resources entrusted to it, by:



1.  providing information about the sources, allocation, and uses of financial resources;

2.  providing information about how the entity financed its activities and met its cash requirements;

3.   providing information that is useful in evaluating the entity’s ability to finance its activities and to meet its liabilities and commitments;

4.   providing  information  about  the  financial condition of the entity and changes in it;

5.  providing aggregate information useful in evaluating the entity’s performance in terms of service costs, efficiency and accomplishments;



b.   General   purpose  financial statements  can  also  have a predictive or prospective role, providing information useful in predicting the level of resources required for continued operations, the resources that may be generated by continued operations, and the associated risks and uncertainties. Financial reporting may also provide users with information:



1.  Indicating whether resources were obtained and used in accordance with the legally adopted budget; and

2.  Indicating whether resources were obtained and used in accordance with legal and contractual requirements, including financial limits established by appropriate legislative authorities. (Par. 15-16 PPSAS 1)



c.   Financial statements provide information about an entity’s:

1. Assets;

2. Liabilities;

3. Net assets/equity;

4. Revenue;

5. Expenses;

6. Other changes in net assets/equity;

7. Cash flows; and

8. Comparison of budget and actual amounts

	

	Inquiry from the Accountant disclosed that the server of their eNGAS bogged down on September 28, 2020 and retrieval of financial data is as of the moment futile.  Troubleshooting is still ongoing.  Please note that the server bogged down in September, which is already end of the third quarter yet, latest Trial Balance submitted was for the month of February 2020 only.

	

Recommendations:

	

	In view of the deficiencies noted above, we recommended the following courses of action:

	

1)		 Require the cashiers/disbursing officers/collecting officers to submit the complete reports of their monthly transactions (RCI and RCD) on the fifth day of the ensuing month in compliance with Section 100 of PD 1445 to the Accounting Section. And for the latter to submit the same to the Office of the Auditor within ten (10) days from receipt hereof; and

	

2)		Require the submission of the Bank Reconciliation Statements to the Office of the Auditor within 20 days from Receipt of the Bank Statements.

	

	

 Management’s Comment/s:



1)	The alternative schedule implemented by the University and the curfew hours imposed by the City Government of Davao limited the number of hours the staff of the Cashiering and Accounting Units can work on their reports, vouchers and attachments. Most of these tasks cannot be worked from home; 



CSC MC 10, s. 2020 provides in part -



3.5 Other Alternative Work Arrangements 



a)	Agencies may adopt other alternative work arrangements that are appropriate/applicable to their functions as well as their place of work other than the above-enumerated work arrangements. 



b.   Agencies may use a combination of the above enumerated work arrangements or a combination with the other work arrangements it adopted, such as three-day workweek and 2 day work-from-home arrangement to complete the 40-hour workweek. (emphases ours)



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



It must be noted by Management that whatever alternative work arrangements adopted by the Finance Division that are appropriate/applicable to their functions,  the 40-hour workweek should still  be followed.



Management’s Comment/s:



2)	It has always been the practice of the Cashiering Unit to submit the complete reports of its monthly transactions to the Accounting Unit within the period required. . . The Finance Division has always been giving importance to the timely submission of these reports in compliance with existing requirements and to aid in the decision-making of the Top Management. . .”  (emphases ours)



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



Presidential Decree 1445 or the State Audit Code of the Philippines provides-

	

	Section 100. Reports of disbursing officers in a government agency. Disbursing officers in any government agency shall render monthly reports of their transactions pursuant to regulations of the Commission to be submitted not later than the fifth day of the ensuing month to the auditor . . .



 Section 6.05 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 provides: 

            

“The official involved in the daily recording of transactions in the books of accounts shall turn over the receipts and the disbursement records with all paid vouchers and documents evidencing the transactions to the Auditor within ten (10) days from the date of receipt of said documents.” (emphasis supplied)



Chapter 21 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies, Volume I



	Sec. 5. Preparation of the Bank Reconciliation Statement

	

	The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the GSB, reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the BRS in four copies.” (emphasis ours)

		

		

		

		

Sec. 7. Reporting. 



 The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty days after receipt of the monthly BS. . . (emphases ours)



	Tables 1 , 2 and 3 will show that even in the prior years’ (without pandemic), the university were still delayed in their submission of the monthly reports, viz

From the immediately preceding tables, it is clear that for the years 2018 and 2019, the Finance was only able to submit the RCD within the prescribed period in the months of August, September and November 2018, while the rest of the reports especially the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) were very much delayed.



Management’s Comment/s:



3)	“Further, retrieval of the Journal Entry Vouchers that were deleted when the e-NGAs broke down was unsuccessful. This contributed to the delay on the preparation of the Bank Reconciliation since the staff in-charge in the preparation of the report also assisted in identifying the transactions that remain unrecorded.”



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The eNGAS bogged down on September 28, 2020, the ECQ started on March 16, 2020,  the BRSs for January, 2020 were received by COA in June, August  and September 2020, meaning, even before the ECQ and even when the system has not yet bogged down, submission of the January BRS in June was already delayed.                 



Real time balances are readily available through LBP weAccess and DBP snapshots. Although this office is amenable that the preparation of the BRS is really time consuming especially those accounts that are accepting on-line deposits.



Prior years’ submission of Financial Statements was also delayed.

In addition,  per inquiry it was disclosed that the return of some documents given to Officials concerned for signatures were also delayed  and those in charge of processing them were hesitant to follow up the documents despite its urgency.  Please note that Work From Home means doing your regular duty at home.  



Tagum Management’s Comment/s:



	Management justified for the reasons on the delayed submission of the reports as follows:



a)	Limited movement of personnel brought about by COVID19 pandemic;

b)	Retrenchment of employees;

c)	Poor internet connectivity for employees Working from Home scheme;

d)	Claiming of Checks for scholars’ refund on their allowances took a long time affecting submission of all reports to the accounting unit;

e)	Transportation control along Tagum City and Davao City route during ECQ/GCQ period has resulted in the submission of all reports in an intermittent manner;

f)	Limited access for banking transactions due to early cut-off;

g)	Promptness for the remittances to GSIS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG and other agencies were affected brought about by the pandemic;

h)	Payment to suppliers took time which caused delay in the preparation and submission of Report of Check Issued to the accounting unit;



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



Full implementation of the recommendations offered on this Audit Observation Memorandum will only be considered upon submission of all the calendar year 2020 financial reports and statements (except for the year-end reports/statements which is due on February 14, 2021) ) as of December 31, 2020.



Based on subsequent events, only the Report of Collections and Deposits for CY 2020 of all campuses were submitted. However, the Bank Reconciliation Statements and Report of Disbursements were only partially submitted as of this writing.













Unreconciled PPE balances



Obrero Campus



2)	The Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account balance of P647,427,609.75 does not reconcile with the balance per Report of Physical Count of PPE amounting P670,602,154.69 or a difference of P23,174,544.94 due to failure of the Accounting and the Supply Management Units to regularly reconcile their record, contrary to Government Accounting Manual (GAM), and Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM), Volume III, thus, existence, accuracy and reliability of the balances of PPE accounts in the financial statements cannot be ascertained. 



Section 53(b) of GAAM Volume III states the standard for asset accountability which requires comparison of recorded accountability with existing assets to determine whether the actual assets agree with the recorded accountability. Any discrepancy should be investigated in accordance with the existing regulations and appropriate action taken thereon.



Volumes I and II of the GAM specifically provides the following:



Chapter 10- Property, Plant and Equipment



Sec. 38. Physical Count of PPE. The entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 71) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording. 



The following are the forms/reports necessary to account for PPE:



g. Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (Appendix 73) – this form shall be used to report the physical count and condition of PPE by type as at a given date, including those which are unrecorded and those which could not be accounted for. It shows the balance of PPE per property cards and per count and the shortage/overage, if any. It shall be rendered by the Inventory Committee, on its yearly physical count of properties owned by the entity.  



Appendix 71 Instructions-RPCPPE provides in part the following:



E. It shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned and Accounting Division/Unit not later than January 31 of each year. (emphases ours)



	The balances of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts were validated and a comparison was made on the balances between the Annual Report on the Physical Count of PPE and Financial Statements CY for 2019. The result of audit, showed an unreconciled balance of P23,174,544.94 between the two records/reports as summarized below:

	As gleaned from the foregoing table, Other Infrastructure Assets, Hostels and Dormitories and Disaster Response and Rescue Equipment were not included in the physical count. Construction and Heavy Equipment was included in the RPCPPE but not reflected in the Accounting records while the other accounts do not have the same balances reported in the two (2) records. 



	The financial statements for CY 2019 were submitted to the Office of the Auditor on February 14, 2019 while the related RPCPPE was submitted on February 10, 2021, a separate Audit Observation Memorandum was already issued pertaining non-submission of the said report. However, a physical count was conducted on June 2019. These actual timelines of reporting indicate that as at year end the reported PPE balances were not reconciled with the physical report.



	Further inquiry disclosed that there was no regular/periodic reconciliation of records done between the Accounting and the Supply Management Units resulting in the discrepancies in their records. PPE Ledger Cards can be generated from e-NGAS by the Accounting Unit these might serve as Subsidiary Ledgers (SL) to support the PPE accounts in the General Ledger (GL) but were not utilized to compare with the records from Supply Management Unit as to amount and other specification of the items.



	The failure of the University to establish a check and balance control procedures as well as maintaining proper monitoring of records for acquisition, issuance and disposal, creates doubt as to the accuracy, existence and reliability of PPE accounts in the financial statements.



Recommendations: 	



1)	Instruct the Inventory Committee to:



a)	Schedule and conduct the physical count of PPE at earlier dates, and submit to the Auditor the RPCPPE not later than January 31; and 



b)	Report equipment found at station and losses discovered during physical count to the Accounting Unit in accordance with Section 38, Chapter 10 Volume I of the GAM;



2)	Instruct the Supply Management Unit Head and the Accountant to-



	a)	Facilitate the reconciliation of the unreconciled balances with the net amount of (P23,174,544.94);



	b)	Instruct the Supply Management Unit Head to maintain Property Cards (PC) to promptly account receipt and disposition of property in their custody;



	c)	Instruct the Accountant to utilize Property Plant and Equipment Ledger Cards (PPELC) to monitor and promptly account changes in the PPE accounts, i.e. acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset; and



	d)	Require both the Accountant and the Supply Management Units to justify why there were PPEs that were not recorded in the books and included in the physical count.





Management’s Comment/s:



Management required the Accounting and the Supply Units to look into the items included in the RPCPPE but unrecorded in the books.  In addition, Management justified that there were items that were procured but deliveries of which were not yet complete and therefore not yet recorded in the books. 



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



As discussed in the audit observation, “Other Infrastructure Assets, Hostels and Dormitories and Disaster Response and Rescue Equipment were not included in the physical count. Construction and Heavy Equipment were included in the RPCPPE but not reflected in the Accounting records while the other accounts do not have the same balances reported in the two (2) records”. Please note that these PPEs are not just currently procured but in the prior years.





Tagum Campus



3)	The Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account balance of P 350,481,275.36 does not reconcile with the balance per Report of Physical Count of PPE amounting P312,786,376.18 or a difference of P37,694,899.18 due to failure of the Accounting and the Supply Management Units to regularly reconcile their record, contrary to Government Accounting Manual (GAM), and Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM), Volume III, thus, existence, accuracy and reliability of the balances of PPE accounts in the financial statements cannot be ascertained. 



	The balances of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts were validated and a comparison was made on the balances between the Annual Report on the Physical Count of PPE as of December 31, 2020, which was submitted on February 8, 2021and the Post-Closing Trial Balance for CY 2020. The result of audit, showed an unreconciled balance of P37,694,899.18 between the two records/reports as summarized below:

As gleaned from the foregoing table, Land Improvements, Aquaculture Structures and Sports Equipment were not included in the physical count. Hostels and Dormitories, Machinery Other Transportation Equipment were included in the RPCPPE but not reflected in the Accounting records, while the other accounts do not have the same balances as reported in the two (2) records. 



	Further inquiry disclosed that there was no regular/periodic reconciliation of records done between the Accounting and the Supply Management Units resulting in the discrepancies in their records. Moreover, the Accountant and the Head of Supply Management Unit did not maintain Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Cards (PPELC) and Property Card (PC), respectively, contrary to Section 42 of Chapter 10 of Volume I of the GAM, which states that:



“The Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like PAR.” (emphasis supplied)



	Periodic reconciliation of records which involves verification of the accuracy of one set of records against an independent set of documents, in this case, Accounting and Supply Management Units, facilitates the monitoring of the existence and condition of the University’s properties/assets. Hence, misuse, loss and irregularities can be easily detected and/or prevented.



The failure of the University to establish a check and balance control procedures as well as maintaining proper monitoring of records for acquisition, issuance and disposal, creates doubt as to the accuracy, existence and reliability of PPE accounts in the financial statements.



Recommendations: 	



1)	Instruct the Inventory Committee to:



	a)	Schedule and conduct the physical count of PPE at earlier dates, and submit to the Auditor the RPCPPE not later than January 31; and 



	b)	Report equipment found at station and losses discovered during physical count to the Accounting Unit in accordance with Section 38, Chapter 10 Volume I of the GAM;



2)	Instruct the Supply Management Unit Head and the Accountant to –



a)	Facilitate the reconciliation of the unreconciled balances with the net amount of (P37,694,899.18).



b)	Instruct the Supply Management Unit Head to maintain Property Cards (PC) to promptly account receipt and disposition of property in their custody;



c)	Instruct the Accountant to maintain Property Plant and Equipment Ledger Cards (PPELC) to monitor and promptly account changes in the PPE accounts, i.e. acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset;



Require both the Accountant and the Supply Management Units to justify why there were PPEs that were not recorded and included in the physical count.

	 



Management’s Comment/s:

Management commented that the Accountant has started the reconciliation and reclassification of accounts. 



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



Management should see to it that periodic reconciliations be made so that the PPE balances can be relied upon.



Unserviceable properties



Obrero Campus



4)	Unserviceable properties totaling P1,431,806.00 under different funds were not disposed due to failure of the Agency to appraise the same, contrary to Section 79 of the Presidential Decree No. 1445, thereby depriving the agency of additional income from the sale of the subject properties while giving unwarranted burden in the safekeeping thereof.



Section 79 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 on the Destruction or sale of unserviceable property provides that:

	

When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee an award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the Commission, after advertising by printed notice in the Official Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of general circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the expense of publication, by notices posted for a like period in at least three public places in the locality where the property is to be sold. In the event that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned and approved by the Commission.



Furthermore, Section 40(d), Chapter 10 of GAM Volume I provides the policies on idle, unserviceable and fully depreciated PPE and prescribes that all unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74). PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation).



In relation thereto, the Manual on the Disposal of Government Property under DBM National Budget Circular No. 425 states that one of the functions of the Disposal Committee is to set the appraised value of all disposable property considering obsolescence, market demand, physical condition and result of previous biddings for similar property.



In the course of our audit, it was found out that various unserviceable properties totaling P1,431,806.00 under three (3) different funds as recorded in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) as at December 31, 2020 were still not disposed, complete details are presented in Annex E.

Inquiry with the Supply Management Unit (SMU) Head disclosed that the Disposal Committee was not able to make an appraisal of the unserviceable properties, it was prepared but they are still waiting for the different Colleges/offices  to forward such properties. Also, there were PPEs without acquisition cost or can no longer be traced, consequently resulted in the non-disposal thereof.



Management’s Comment/s:



“As of now, the SMU is scheduled to conduct pre-auction canvassing of price to determine the current  market value (CMV) of the equipment listed.  This CMV will be used to compute for the appraised value which will be the floor price (minimum cost) of the equipment for disposal.  After the appraisal of the said equipment, we will be conducting PUBLIC AUCTION and follow the bidding process for the disposal of equipment…”



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The University should give more attention on the disposal of its unserviceable properties in order to avoid overstating its assets, prevent further deterioration thereby obtaining the fair return in case of sale, to relieve accountable officers of unnecessary accountability, and make available space for the Agency.



Tagum Campus



5)	Unserviceable properties totaling P4,059,367.30 were not disposed due to failure of the Agency to appraise the same, contrary to Section 79 of the Presidential Decree No. 1445, thereby depriving the agency of additional income from the sale of the subject properties while giving unwarranted burden in the safekeeping thereof.



In the course of our audit, it was found out that various unserviceable properties totaling P4,059,367.30 recorded in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) as at December 31, 2020 were still not disposed, complete details are presented in Annex F.

Inquiry with the Supply Management Unit Head disclosed that the Disposal Committee was not able to make an appraisal of the unserviceable properties. There were PPEs without acquisition cost or can no longer be traced. Also, there are potential buyers of unserviceable IT equipment such as computers, laptops and other IT peripherals but refused to follow proper disposal procedures which consequently resulted in the non-disposal thereof.



The University should give more attention on the disposal of its unserviceable properties in order to avoid overstating its assets, prevent further deterioration thereby obtaining the fair return in case of sale, to relieve accountable officers of unnecessary accountability, and make available space for the agency



We recommended that Obrero and Tagum Campuses management prioritize the disposal of its unserviceable properties taking into consideration their obsolescence, market demand and physical condition.



Management’s Comment/s:



Unserviceable PPEs are already sorted out and identified as to the accountable officers to whom these were issued and an area was already pinpointed and allotted on where to place the same while undergoing the process of appraisal and eventually its disposal. 



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The University should give more attention on the disposal of its unserviceable properties in order to avoid overstating its assets, prevent further deterioration thereby obtaining the fair return in case of sale, to relieve accountable officers of unnecessary accountability, and make available space for the Agency.





Due from Local Government Units and NGOs/POs



Tagum Campus



6)		Long outstanding fund transfers to two (2) Local Government Units (LGUs) and NGO/PO totaling P111,087.55, remained in the books for over seven to ten years due to failure of the implementing agencies/organization to liquidate the same, contrary to COA Circular 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 and COA Circular 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007, thus determining the validity and accuracy of these receivable accounts cannot be ascertained. 

		

		COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 prescribes the Rules and Regulations in the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of Funds Transferred to Implementing Agencies in which salient provisions regarding the Duties and Responsibilities of the Implementing and Source Agencies are provided, viz:

	

4. GENERAL GUIDELINES



4.6   Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds.  Only actual project expenses shall be reported.  The reports shall be approved by the Head of the IA.



5. DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SOURCE AGENCY:



      The SA shall:



5.4  require the Implementing Agency (IA) to submit the reports and furnish the IA with a copy of the journal voucher taking up the expenditures. . . (emphasis ours)

		

		Whereas Section 5.4 of COA Circular 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007 states that:

		

		5.4 Within sixty (60) days after the completion of the project, the NGO/PO shall submit the final Fund Utilization Report certified by its Accountant and approved by its President/Chairman to the GO, together with the inspection report and certificate of project completion rendered/issued by the GO authorized representative, list of beneficiaries with their acceptance/acknowledgement of the project/funds/goods /services received. The validity of these documents shall be verified by the internal auditor or equivalent official of the GO and shall be the basis of the GO in recording the fund utilization in its books of accounts. These documents shall support the liquidation of funds granted to the NGO/PO.

		

		Receivables from Local Government Units (LGUs) and Non-Government Organizations/People’s Organization (NGOs/POs) as of December 31, 2020 have the following balances:

		

Due from LGUs

					The above fund transfers to LGUs totaling P86,087.55 were released by USeP Tagum-Mabini Campus to the Provincial Governments of Compostela Valley and Davao del Norte in 2013 and 2010, respectively, for Enhancing Farmer’s Information and Technology Services (FITS) for Rural Development and purchase of equipment.  The main objective of this program was to develop, validate, and promote an effective mechanism for Research and Development utilization through the implementation of Techno Gabay Program. However, to date, these accounts remained unliquidated in the books for seven to ten years already, thus the validity of these receivable accounts cannot be ascertained due to the failure of the LGUs to liquidate the same. Details are presented below as of December 31, 2020:

				Another fund transfer which remained unliquidated in the amount of P25,000.00, was made on May 07, 2010 to a cooperative named San Remegio Agrarian Beneficiary Multipurpose Cooperative (SARBEMCO), a non-government organization located in Peñaplata, Island Garden City of Samal, with the purpose of  NGO’s product enhancement and labeling. It was informed that Management had visited the NGO last 2019 and requested on the partial/full liquidation but no report has been submitted yet as of to date.

				

					Be it noted that the fund transfers to Provincial Government of Davao del Norte and SARBEMCO totaling P53,497.55 had long been made or  ten (10) years had already elapsed, therefore, management must do something about the non-moving receivable or ‘Due From’ accounts and be guided with COA Circular 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 on the Guidelines and Procedures for the Writing-off of Dormant Receivable Accounts. This Guideline was issued for reconciling and cleaning the books of accounts with dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances and fund transfers for fair presentation of accounts in the financial statements. Hence, the University needs to ascertain the collectability of the said receivables in order to proceed with the necessary procedures in writing-off the dormant accounts.

			

				As of December 31, 2020, USeP Tagum Management has not taken appropriate actions for the immediate settlement of the stated past due receivables by demanding their immediate liquidations, thereby resulting in the overstatement of receivable accounts, and affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements by P111,087.55. 



We recommended that Management as the Source Agency (SA):



	a)	Direct the Finance Division Officer to issue Demand Letters for the Implementing Agencies: Provincial Governments of Compostela Valley, Davao del Norte and SARBEMCO to fully liquidate the ‘Due From’ accounts and to submit a copy of the duly received Demand Letters to COA as reference in audit; and



	b)	Require the University Accountant to closely monitor the liquidation of fund transfers to the different Implementing Agencies, to faithfully perform her duties and responsibilities in accord with the agreement conditions, as well as to comply with the provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013, 2017-001, 2016-005 and other related issuances so as not to be faulted with negligence.

		

		Management’s Comment/s:

		

				Demand letters were already sent out to LGUs and NGO concerned.  Compostela Valley LGU will be returning the unspent amount, while with Davao del Norte and the NGO, Management is still awaiting for the their response to the Demand Letters. 

		

		Auditor’s Rejoinder:

		

					The Audit Team will strictly monitor  the compliance of the implementing agency on the monthly submission of the RCI and ROD  on the report of utilization of the funds.

		

Prepaid Insurance



Obrero Campus



7)	Prepaid Insurance for Motor Vehicle was understated by P4,284.16 while prepaid insurance for Building was overstated by P4,172.42 due to incorrect computation of insurance expense, affecting the accuracy of the reported balances in the Financial Statements.



Section 112 of the Presidential Decree 1445, otherwise known as the State Audit Code of the Philippines, states that:

	

Recording of financial transactions. Each government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations conformably with generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations.



			Generally Accepted Accounting Principles prescribe that expenses incurred during the period shall be taken up in the period these were incurred in consonance with the Matching Principle in Accounting.

			

				Analysis of the subsidiary ledger of Prepaid Insurance of the University for CY 2020, revealed that the Accountant initially recorded payments for insurance as Prepaid Insurance and subsequently charges it to expense over the duration of the contract starting on the actual payment instead of effective date of the insurance contract, to wit:

It was noted that the contracts for the payment of insurance to Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) were not attached to the disbursement vouchers (DVs). The Accountant explained that she was not able to submit as the University Records Office did not furnish the Accounting Office copies of such contracts. Hence, she had assumed that that the date of the actual payment corresponds the effective date of the insurance contract. 



On February 10, 2021, the Audit Team received copies of such contracts from the University Records Office except for the following payments to GSIS:

It can be gleaned from the foregoing data presented that there was no proper coordination among the Offices which affects the accuracy of the reported balances of asset, expense as well as income in the Financial Statements. Failure to adjust the affected accounts will render the reported balances unreliable.



We recommended Management to:



a)	Require the Accountant to adjust the Prepaid Insurance account for Motor Vehicles and Buildings and submit all copies of the insurance contracts to the Audit Team; and



b)	Instruct the responsible Office/Department to furnish the Accounting Office copies of Insurance Contracts to ensure the proper recording of the prepaid insurance and expenses.



Management’s Comment/s:



The Accountant is currently preparing the working papers to adjust the recording of  the Prepaid Insurance and Expense accounts and requested from the Records Officer for copies of the contracts to serve as their bases in computing for the said accounts.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



Contracts should always form part of the documentary requirements when payments are made.







Tagum Campus



8)	Payments for insurance premiums amounting to P41,648.47 for CY 2020 were considered as outright expense instead of recognizing them as prepayments to be taken up as Prepaid Insurance contrary to Section 53.a of Government Accounting Manual (GAM), thus understating the appropriate asset and overstating the expense account as at year end.



Section 112 of the Presidential Decree 1445, otherwise known as the State Audit Code of the Philippines, states that:

	

Recording of financial transactions. Each government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations conformably with generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations.



			Generally Accepted Accounting Principles prescribe that expenses incurred during the period shall be taken up in the period these were incurred in consonance with the Matching Principle in Accounting.



Also, Section 53.a of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs, Volume I provides that:



Asset/Expense Adjustments: These pertain to assets, portion of which are consumed/used/incurred at the end of accounting period. Examples of these adjustments are prepayments. Prepayments are expenses paid before they are incurred. At the end of the accounting period, expired portion shall be determined and an adjusting journal entry shall be prepared to recognize the expense applicable to the period being reported. (emphasis ours)



	Our examination of the accounts and records for CY 2020 disclosed that the Agency has paid insurance premiums for Motor Vehicles amounting to P41,648.47. Verification in the books showed that advance payments of insurance premiums were initially recognized as Insurance Expense instead of Prepaid Insurance, details of such expenses as follows:

Recording the entire amount of the expense in the year-end financial statements would produce an inaccurate report since only a part of the insurance premiums has been used up. The unexpired portion should be reflected in the books as Prepaid Insurance until all the insurance premiums were used.



In view thereof, the Prepaid Insurance Account was understated, and the recognized expense was overstated, thereby affecting the fairness of the presentation in the financial statements.



We recommended that Management require the Accountant to:



 a) 	Adjust the Prepaid Insurance Account and the related expense accounts applying the effective date stated in the Insurance Contract as basis for the recognition of related expense; and



 b)  Strictly adhere with the provisions of Section 112 of PD 1445 and Section 53.a Volume I of Government Accounting Manual for NGAs. 



Management’s Comment/s:



The Accountant was instructed to adjust the Expense account to Prepaid Insurance the unused portion of the Insurance.





Auditor’s Rejoinder:



			    Expenses incurred during the period shall be taken up in the period these were incurred in consonance with the Matching Principle in Accounting.





Internal Control on On-line Deposits



9)	Weak internal controls and procedures for online collections and deposits by the USEP clienteles were not properly defined and inconsistent with Section 124 of PD 1445, resulting in the delayed issuance of Official Receipts and difficulty in matching/reconciling the same with the deposits reflected in the bank statements, thus making the financial reports unreliable. 



Presidential Decree 1445 



Section 124. Installation. It shall be the direct responsibility of the agency head to install, implement, and monitor a sound system of internal control. 



Strong internal controls for cash collection are necessary to prevent mishandling of  funds. They are   designed to safeguard   and protect employees from inappropriate charges of mishandling funds by defining their responsibilities in the cash handling process. Cash handling duties can be divided into three stages: receiving, depositing, and reconciling.



Presidential Decree 1445 



Section 68. Issuance of Official receipt.



1)	No payment of any nature shall be received by a collecting officer without immediately issuing an official receipt in acknowledgment thereof. . .



Due to the health crisis which the nation has been experiencing, the University decided to suspend the operations of the Cashier’s Unit to receive any payment in the form of cash to avoid close contact with its clientele. To do this, online enrollment system for the 1st semester of AY 2020-2021 was implemented with the following as alternative payment options: 



OPTION 1: Through Land Bank LinkBiz Portal 



For clients with LBP iAccess accounts, they may utilize the e-Payment facility of Land Bank of the Philippines, Link.BizPortal



OPTION 2: Through Deposit or Fund Transfer to USeP Bank Accounts 



The University is maintaining the following bank accounts where online deposits are made, viz:





Obrero Campus

Mintal Campus

Tagum Campus

Mabini Campus

Bislig Campus

The online enrollment system illustrates that once payment has been successfully deposited or transferred, students shall email the Order Payment form (applicable only for transactions with the Registrar’s Office) and proof of payment (i.e. a photo or scanned copy of the deposit slip or a screenshot of fund transfer confirmation) to the Cashier. Verification by the Cashier usually takes twenty-four (24) hours from the time of receipt of the email. After verification, the Cashier issues official receipt.



Meanwhile, for fund transfers, the bank needs to clear the transfer and will usually be credited to USeP’s bank accounts within three (3) to five (5) banking days depending on the gateway used. Deposit or fund transferred from other bank accounts to USeP bank accounts will only be accepted by the system provided the “other banks” are participating in PESONet and InstaPay. Again, students shall email the Order Payment form (applicable only for transactions with the Registrar’s Office) and proof of payment (i.e. a photo or scanned copy of the deposit slip or a screenshot of fund transfer confirmation) to the Cashier after which verification shall be done by the Cashier of the fund transfer within two (2) to three (3) days upon receipt of email. Once verified, an email shall be sent to the payee on the confirmation of payment. The Cashier issues official receipt after the verification process.



 From the table above, Obrero and Mintal Campuses currently use Evening Program with LBP Account No. 0162-1051-75 for the online enrollment. Since both campuses share a common bank account, various collecting officers will also issue ORs. The same is true with Tagum and Mabini Campuses wherein both use Special Trust Fund (STF) with LBP Account No.  0942-1110-68. During the verification of bank statements, the audit team experienced difficulty in tracing to which collecting officer shall the online deposits be accounted for. 



The cash examination for the collections and deposits made by Ms. Maria Luz M. Serafica for the period May 28, 2019 to August 25, 2020 showed that various online deposits incurred delays in the issuance or preparation of official receipts ranging from 2-50 days, details are presented in Annex G, thereby violating Presidential Decree 1445 on OR issuance.

 

 According to the Accountable Officer the delay in the issuance or preparation of official receipts is a result of the implementation of online enrollment system. The personnel-in-charge of Cashiering Section is having a hard time in tracing and reconciling the online deposits. Considering the voluminous transactions per day during enrollment period, he will individually trace in the bank snapshots and excel file generated report from Linkbiz Portal. He will match these documents to the students’ email for the proof of payments. Also, verification for interbank fund transfers is more tedious because of longer clearing process. Therefore, these complications resulted to late submission of Report of Collections and Deposits (RCDs) to the Resident Auditor’s Office. 



Relatively, the cash examination of Ms. Louisabel Bonador, Finance Department needs to resubmit four (4) Report of Collections and Deposits dated July 7, 8, 15 & 20, 2020. These RCDs were pending because management communicated with Land Bank of the Philippines for the reconciliation of online deposits made on the particular dates especially for payments made in Linkbiz Portal. 

         

In effect, there is difficulty in establishing the accuracy of deposits made by the University’s clients. Likewise, the accuracy of matching the issued ORs with the deposits reflected in the bank statements is also tedious and unreliable because the verification of deposit is done manually by the Cashiering Unit based on the time reflected in the proof of payment sent through email by the payee and the time the deposit was posted in the bank statement will differ because of clearing process. There is always a possibility that payment through online platforms will be done at the same time by different payees but will be posted in the bank statement at different time or day. Further, because of manual verification, some deposits may not be identified by the management more so that collection is almost always the same due to the same amount of fees due. As a consequence, extensive verification of bank reconciliation and more man-hours are needed because of voluminous reconciling items. 



Recommendations:



We recommended that Management:



1)	Provide a strong internal control to facilitate/generate real-time reconciliation  and early preparation of the Bank Reconciliation Statements by making Representation with the depository bank to achieve efficient and effective system which is tailored-fit for USEP’s online collections and deposits and explore other ways and means to achieve the purpose of the same;



2)	Consider assigning a Head Collecting Officer to be accountable for all collections and deposits and increase the amount of bond to match accountability;



3)	Consider assigning a Sub-Collecting Officer to collect, issue official receipt and prepare Report of Collections and Deposits which will be submitted to the Head CO for consolidation and verification;



4)	Consider assigning a separate Disbursing Officer for issuance of checks and facilitate grant and liquidation of cash advances; and



5)	Effect the above-stated recommendations on or before the second semester AY 2020-2021.





Management’s Comment/s:



Management justified that they have assigned a staff to issue the Official Receipt and the other one to look into the emails in order to identify from whom the collection was made. As of the moment, the University is preparing the e-process on On-line deposits. Mintal was also instructed to open an account where On-line deposits will be made.





Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The failure of the agency to strictly comply with the guidelines in ensuring effective cash management undermines critical control procedures in safeguarding government funds and assets. 





	Internal Control on Check Disbursements

	

	Obrero and Tagum Campuses

	

10)			The practice of drawing checks to payees who at the same time were also the signatories to the checks amounting to P123,500.00 contravened Section 124 of PD 1445 and some basic Internal Control policies on Cash Disbursements, thereby giving the signatories undue controls over the disbursement cycle.



Presidential Decree 1445 



Section 124. Installation. It shall be the direct responsibility of the agency head to install, implement, and monitor a sound system of internal control.



	Internal Control on Cash Disbursements states in part 

	

“Separating the procedures in the disbursement cycle -



To maintain separate duties in the disbursement cycle, the areas of approval, recording, and custody (disbursement) must be identified and assigned to different employees.  No financial payment should be handled by one person from beginning to end.”   (emphasis ours)

Separating out the approval, processing and disbursement steps ensures that one employee does not have the ability to make a disbursement out of an agency’s account without someone else’s eyes on it.”

Going over some of the cash advances granted to the accountable officers of the Obrero and Tagum Campuses disclosed that some check signatories signed checks for cash advances granted to themselves, details of which are presented in the succeeding page.

Such practice weakens the internal control on cash disbursements the aim of which is to mitigate the risk of fraud.



Recommendation:



In view of this internal control weakness, we recommended that check signatories refrain from signing checks issued to themselves in order not to weaken the internal control over cash disbursements.



Management’s Comment/s:



“In view of this, the Office of the Vice President for Administration issued a Memorandum… to the concerned Officials for proper guidance on the strict implementation, that in the issuance of checks, payees named therein must not also be the signatories of the same to maintain a sound internal control system.”





Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Audit Team shall monitor the implementation of this Memorandum. 





Cash Advances



11)	Several infractions were committed relative to the disposition of cash advances contrary to Section 4 of COA Circular 97-002 and Section 1 of COA Circular 2012-001 which put the University at a risk of possible loss of government funds and properties.



COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides:

	

	4. Granting and Utilization of Cash Advances

	

	4.1 General Guidelines

	

	4.1.2 No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.

	4.1.6 Transfer of cash advance from one Accountable Officer (AO) to another shall not be allowed.

Inquiry with the Disbursing Officer disclosed that the delay in liquidation of cash advances is due to the fact that these were transferred to other employees, thus resulting to slow completion of required supporting documents by the ones who actually used the cash advances.



To protect the accountable officer from any liabilities or penalties as a result of the delays in liquidation, one recourse is to return any unused funds within the allowable period regardless of any pending claims.



Failure of the accountable officers to liquidate on time deprived the government on the use of funds had there been any unutilized amount.

As shown above, the accountable officer was granted additional cash advances without liquidating/settling the previous cash advances which is contrary to Section 89 of Presidential Decree 1445 which states:



 “Section 89. 	Limitation on Cash Advance. - No cash advances shall be given unless for a legally specific purpose. A cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served.  No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.”



Section 128. Penal provision. Any violation of the provisions of Sections 67, 68, 89, 106, and 108 of this Code or any regulation issued by the Commission implementing these sections, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand pesos or by imprisonment not exceeding six (6) months, or both such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court.

It has been observed that the same observations were made for the last three years and yet management still disregard these laws, rules and regulations by not strictly complying with them which undermines critical control procedures in safeguarding government funds and thereby exposes it to risks of loss and misuse. 



Attention is invited to CSC Memorandum Circular No. 12, s. of 2012, which provides for the liability of accountable officers who disregard the rules and regulations on liquidation within the prescribed period-



Rule V.  Administrative Liability



Section 8.  The failure of an Accountable Officer to render an account in full within the periods prescribed and after formal demand shall constitute the administrative offense of Gross Neglect of Duty punishable by dismissal from the service for the first offense.  Full liquidation/settlement/payment of the subject cash advance outside the given periods shall constitute the offense of Simple Neglect of Duty punishable by suspension from the service for one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months for the first offense, and dismissal from the service for the second offense. (emphasis ours)



Further attention is invited to Section 183 of the GAAM which provides-



“Responsibility of the agency head.  It shall be the responsibility of the Head of the Agency to ensure the proper granting, utilization and liquidation of all cash advances in accordance with these rules and regulations.”



Recommendations:



We recommended that Management:



1)	Strictly implement the rules and regulations relevant to cash advances by withholding the salaries of accountable officers who will not liquidate on time; 



2)	Impose the administrative liability as provided in CSC Memorandum Circular No. 12, s. 2012, whenever necessary; and



3)	Direct the accountable officer to return any unused funds within the allowable period regardless of any pending claims to avoid any delays in the liquidation of cash advances.



Management’s Comment/s:



1)	Transfer of cash advances to other Accountable Officers -



a)	The Cash advance under Ms. Magandi’s accountability was honestly given to Mr. Robert Satorre, designated USeP Liaison Officer, who was tasked to process the documents in the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Office.



b)	The Cash Advance was transferred to another employee who joined the BOR meeting because the meeting was held in CHED Manila.



c)	The cash advance of P10,000.00 was given to another employee due to the fact that Ms. Magandi has other functions and responsibilities to attend to during the graduation ceremony.



d)	The Cash advance was turned over to another employee since Ms. Magandi was only given two (2) days to report to work.



2)	Delayed Liquidation of Cash Advances



a)	There was a delay in the liquidation due to some delayed submission of requirements for renewal of foreign students.  Ms. Magandi had to wait for them to complete their requirements, thus causing delay on the liquidation of the Cash Advance.



b)	The delay in the liquidation was due to compliance with the various documents to support the transaction, which must be attached upon liquidation.  Further, several signatures must be obtained to finally complete the attached documentary requirements.



3)	Lesser cash advances were granted during the year.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



These observations have been recurring and we call on the attention of the Agency Head that it is her responsibility to ensure the proper granting, utilization and liquidation of all cash advances in accordance with these rules and regulations. 

	

CY 2018 Performance Based Bonus



Obrero Campus



12)	CY 2018 Performance-Based Bonus (PBB) in the total amount of P451,146.49 was paid to employees whose cash advances were not liquidated pursuant to COA Circular No. 97-002 as reiterated in COA Circular No. 2009-002, Executive Order No. 77 and further contravening Memorandum Circular No. 2018-1 on the Grant of PBB  for CY 2018, therefore raising questions whether the grant may have been irregular.

	

	Memorandum Circular No. 2018-1 of the Inter-Agency Task Force on the Harmonization of National Government Performance Monitoring, Information and Reporting Systems states in part-

	

	7.12  Officials and employees who failed to liquidate all cash advances received in FY 2018 within the reglementary period, as prescribed in COA Circular 97-2002 dated February 10, 1997 and reiterated in COA Circular No. 2009-002 dated May 18,2009, shall not be entitled to the FY 2018 PBB.  (emphasis ours)



COA Circular No. 2009-002 partly provides -

In addition, Executive Order No. 77 - Prescribing Rules and Regulations and Rates of Expenses and Allowances for Official Local and Foreign Travels of Government Personnel also provides-



----media/image3.emf----

	

Audit of the CY 2018 PBB disclosed that with all the foregoing laws, rules and regulations pertaining to cash advances and despite the inability of the officials and   employees of the Obrero Campus to comply with them, they were still granted the PBB totaling P425,566.99.  Details in Annex “H”.



Please note that with all the periods prescribed in the aforementioned laws, rules and regulations, the ultimate imperative is that “All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of the year, except for Petty Cash Fund.”



In addition, that there were also CY 2017 unliquidated Cash Advances that were liquidated in CY 2018 in the total amount of P41,350.75 (Annex I).  However, this is still held in abeyance pending receipt of the answer to this Office’s inquiry made with the PBB Secretariat.



Such practice of disregarding the laws, rules and regulations in paying for the PBB is considered as irregular, meaning it is an expenditure incurred without adhering to established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have gained recognition in laws and therefore disallowable in audit.



Recommendation:



We recommended to stop the practice of paying PBBs to those who are not qualified to receive the same and to require its immediate refund. 



Management’s comment/s:



	1.  As to employees whose cash advances remain unliquidated as of 31 December 2018 but were able to liquidate within the reglementary period:

	

	“There are some employees whose cash advances are not yet liquidated as of the year ending  2018, however, the time to liquidate the same is still within the reglementary period. Such being the case, the University did not contravene the provisions cited under Executive Order No. 77 prescribing Rules and Regulations and Rates of Expenses and Allowances for Official Local and Foreign Travels of Government Personnel …”

	

2.  Employees whose cash advances are liquidated as of December 31, 2018: 

	

	“The list submitted by the Finance Division included employees who have liquidated their respective cash advances during the year 2018 but without regard as to whether the liquidation was made within the reglementary period or not. 

	

	Thus, it was shown in the records that the identified employees do not have outstanding cash advances as of December 31, 2018, which became the basis for their eligibility to receive PBB.”

	

	3.  Stop the practice of paying PBBs to those who do not qualify to receive the same. 

	

“We do acknowledge that the Finance Division had interpreted item 1. b above in a different way which became the basis for the subject employees to be included in the list of those eligible to receive the PBB.”



4.  “We have considered several factors but the substantial reason for doing so is that it was what we have been implementing when it comes to payment of the Performance Based Bonus in prior years.  We have deemed such to be proper because of the non-receipt of any Audit Observation Memorandum regarding this.”



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



During the initial referral made by the Finance Officer to the Auditor,  it was agreed that those with unliquidated cash advances which do not follow the prescribed dates will not be granted the PBB.  Note that a Schedule of Unliquidated Cash Advance was already prepared for this purpose.



However, in another referral made, among the many, it was even the Finance People who pointed out that the IATF guidelines pertains to “cash advances received in FY 2018 . . .” which means not only as of December 31, 2018 should employees be without unliquidated balances but liquidations should be made in accordance with COA Circulars within the entire CY 2018.



To this, the Auditor agreed that  all cash advances received during the year CY 2018 should be liquidated in accordance with COA Circulars in order to be granted the PBB, not only as of December 31, 2018. And with such agreement, it was expected that a new schedule of those who are qualified to receive the PBB is being prepared.  



Then again, Finance went to COA and informed that upon advice, they will stick to the  original Schedule of Unliquidated Cash Advances, which unfortunately is violative of the said IATF Guideline and COA Circulars.



Among the amended and latest prescribed dates are reiterated as follows:



 COA Circular No. 2009-002 dated May 18,2009  provides in part -



----media/image1.jpeg----

----media/image1.jpeg----

----media/image1.jpeg----



----media/image2.png----



The Auditor further reiterates the ultimate imperative on liquidations of cash advances, which cannot be disregarded/ignored that “All Cash advances shall be liquidated at the end of each year.”  Meaning, regardless of whether it is still within the prescribed 30 days or twenty (20) days for Travel and Field Operating Expenses, respectively, as of December 31 of each year, cash advances, except for the Petty Cash Fund, should be liquidated in full.



Such mandate is in keeping with the PD 1445 or the State Audit Code of the Philippines which provides in part- 



“Section 111. Keeping of accounts.



(1) The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.





Section 119. Accounting for obligations and expenditures. 



All lawful expenditures and obligations incurred during the year shall be taken up in the accounts of that year.”  (emphasis ours)



This is to not understate the expenses and overstate the assets/cash of the Agency at the end of the year.  Recognizing the expenses at the wrong time may distort the financial statements greatly and provide an inaccurate financial position of the Agency.

Lastly,  on the non-receipt of an AOM pertaining to PBB in the prior years, please note that the USeP was not able to receive the PBB in calendar years 2016 and 2017, while the current Auditor only assumed in October, 2017.  “I cannot answer for the previous auditors why they did not issue an AOM similar to the one issued by this Office.   But for information purposes, this Office cannot be expected to cover all expenses incurred by your Office due to the voluminous transactions of the Obrero and other external campuses coupled with the lack of manpower in the Office of the Auditor.”



Likewise, non-receipt of an AOM regarding the PBB does not necessarily mean that previous payments are already correct and compliant with the guidelines on PBB.



For further information, in Baybay Water District vs. Commission On Audit, the Supreme Court stated that:



" The erroneous application and enforcement of the law by public officers does not estop the government from making a subsequent correction of such error.  More specifically, where there is an express provision of law prohibiting the grant of certain benefits, the law must be enforced even if it prejudices certain parties due to an error committed by public officials in granting the benefit.... Practice, without more, no matter how long continued, cannot give rise to any vested right if it is contrary to law." (emphasis ours)



Tagum-Mabini Campuses



Audit of the CY 2018 PBB disclosed that with all the foregoing laws, rules and regulations pertaining to cash advances and despite the inability of the University’s officials and   employees  to comply with them, they were still granted the PBB.  Details are as follows:

Please note that with all the periods prescribed in the aforementioned laws, rules and regulations, the ultimate imperative is that “All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of the year, except for Petty Cash Fund.”



Such practice of disregarding the laws, rules and regulations in paying for the PBB is considered as irregular, meaning it is an expenditure incurred without adhering to established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have gained recognition in laws and therefore disallowable in audit.



Management’s Comment/s:



According to the Administrative Officer –



“The result of the ranking of the delivery units was made in our central office in Obrero, Davao City. We are aware that there were some deliverables and criteria to be considered before an employee can qualify such benefit.  All our financial reports had been updated and submitted to our central office for consolidation.  As to who qualified this benefit, the final master list payroll was made from our central office and we were just furnished a copy in the external campuses for us to prepare the payment to all the recipients.



As to the delayed processing of our cash advances liquidation that reached beyond the reglementary period, there were just supporting documents not attached immediately upon submission of the liquidation report . . .”



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



Some of those granted PBBs were also erroneously paid in the Obrero Campus.

RA 9184 – Procurement of Infrastructure



13)	Non-compliance by the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC), Technical Working Group (TWG) and BAC Secretariat on their procurement of infrastructure project from  Hexamindz Corporation amounting to P26,355,073.0 contravened some provisions of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of RA 9184, the Government Procurement Reform Act, resulting in the insufficient or inaccurate reports/documents.



The following are  the observations noted on the Bid documents, viz:



1)	Non-submission of the following documents:



a)	17.6. Detailed Engineering for the Procurement of Infrastructure Projects 



No bidding and award of contract for Infrastructure Projects shall be made unless the detailed engineering investigations, surveys and designs, for the project have been sufficiently carried out and duly approved in accordance with the standards and specifications prescribed by the HoPE concerned or his duly authorized representative, pursuant to the recommendation of the end-user or implementing unit and in accordance with the provisions of Annex “A” of this IRR.



Annex “A” 



3(i) Program of Work – Before prosecuting any project, the necessary program of work shall be prepared and submitted for approval. In no case shall construction funds be remitted to field offices or construction work on a project be started before the program of work is approved, in accordance with existing laws. 



No program of work for any project shall be approved without detailed engineering. (emphasis ours)





Detailed Engineering- per Annex “A” of RA9184



“2.   A schedule of detailed engineering activities shall include the following: 

	

	a)		Survey 

	b)		Site Investigation 

	c)		Soils and Foundation Investigation 

	d)		Construction Materials Investigation . . .

	e)		. . .

	f)		. . .

	g)		. . . 

	h)		Preparation of Program of Work 

	i)		Preparation of Proposed Construction Schedule (and estimated Cash Flow for projects with Schedule over Six (6) Months) 

	j)		. . . 

	k)		Preparation of Utility Relocation Plan 

	l)		. . . 

	m)		. . . 

	n)		Preparation of minimum requirements for a Construction Safety and Health 

	Program for the project being considered 

	o)		Value Engineering Studies 

	p)		 . . .



5.  As a requirement for the procurement of infrastructure works, the concerned consultants/government officials who prepared and approved the detailed engineering shall issue a certification that the detailed engineering surveys and designs have been conducted according to the prescribed agency standards and specifications in conformance with the provisions of this Annex, and that the detailed engineering outputs are adequate for the procurement at hand.”



Please note that the above requirements for Detailed Engineering were also not submitted during the Construction of Phase I of the CGB Building. However, an addendum was issued to address this issue on the Detailed Engineering, which as of this writing remained unsubmitted.



b)		Copies of letters of Invitations to Observers to COA, Private Groups and NGOs



“ Section 13. Observers 

 

13.1. To enhance the transparency of the process, the BAC shall, during the eligibility checking, shortlisting, pre-bid conference, preliminary examination of bids, bid evaluation, and post-qualification, invite, in addition to the representative of the COA, at least two (2) observers, who shall not have the right to vote. . . 



. . .1) At least one (1) shall come from a duly recognized private group in a sector or discipline relevant to the procurement at hand . . .



 2) The other observer shall come from a non-government organization (NGO). . .  (emphases supplied)”



Documents submitted were only for the following:



1)	 COA – Prebid Conference and Post-Qualifications

2)	 DPWH ROXI – Chief Maintenance Division – Post Qualification



Invitation to DPWH is unnecessary since, it is neither a Private Group nor an NGO. While for COA is only for two procurement stages instead of all the stages of the procurement process.



c)	Copies of publication in the Website of the University and Certificate of Publication were not submitted for the Notice of Award and Notice to Proceed.



Sections 21.2.1 (a), 37.1. 6 and 37.4.2 partially provide-

			

“37.1.6. The BAC, through the Secretariat, shall post, within three (3) calendar days from its issuance, the Notice of Award in the PhilGEPS, the website of the procuring entity, if any, and any conspicuous place in the premises of the procuring entity.” (emphasis ours)



The Notice of Award (NOA) dated December 11, 2017 received by the bidder on December 14, 2017  was neither published in the website of the procuring agency  nor was a  certification issued that this was posted in conspicuous places in the premises of the procuring entity.

	

“37.4.2. (as amended)  The procuring entity, through the BAC Secretariat, shall post a copy of the Notice to Proceed and the approved contract in the PhilGEPS and the website of the procuring entity, if any, within fifteen (15) calendar days from the issuance of the Notice to Proceed.” (emphasis ours)”

The Notice to Proceed (NTP)  that was dated December 12, 2017 was received by the winning bidder on January 9, 2018. Again, neither certification was issued that this was posted in conspicuous places in the premises of the procuring entity nor published in the website of the agency.



Non-compliance with the posting requirements will affect the transparency in the procurement process and competitiveness through wide dissemination of bid opportunities.  





2. Other observations :



a)	BAC Resolution No. 2017-27 was dated December 13, 2017, while the NOA was dated December 11, 2017 is not in consonance with the stages of the procurement process;



b)	The NTP  that was dated December 12, 2017 while the contact was dated December 13, 2017 which makes the NTP prepared ahead of the Contract.  Moreover, the NTP was received by the winning bidder on January 9, 2018, or twenty eight (28) days after.



37.4. Notice to Proceed 

 

37.4.1. The concerned Procuring Entity shall issue the Notice to Proceed together with a copy or copies of the approved contract to the successful bidder within seven (7) calendar days from the date of approval of the contract by the appropriate government approving authority. 



c)	Performance Bond was dated December 20, 2017 or seven (7) days after the Contract was entered into.



Section 39. Performance Security 



39.1. To guarantee the faithful performance by the winning bidder of its obligations under the contract in accordance with the Bidding Documents, it shall post a performance security prior to the signing of the contract.  

 

d)	The Bill of Quantities (BOQ) prepared by the Physical Development Division (PDD) shows the quantity to be bid as by “lot” instead of detailed materials and labor to be used. (Snapshot No. 1-portion of the BOQ)



A bill of quantity (BOQ) is a document used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_for_bids">tendering</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction">construction</a> industry / supplies in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_material">materials</a>, parts, and labor   (and their costs) are itemized.  It  also  (ideally)  details the terms and conditions of the construction or repair contract and itemizes all work to enable a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_contractor">contractor</a> to price the work for which he or she is bidding. The quantities may be measured in number, length, area, volume, weight or time.  Preparing a bill of quantities requires that the design is complete and a specification has been prepared. The bill of quantities is issued to tenderers for them to prepare a price for carrying out the construction work. The bill of quantities assists tenderers in the calculation of construction costs for  their  tender,  and as it means all tendering contractors 

will be pricing the same quantities (rather than taking-off quantities from the drawings and specifications themselves), it also provides a fair and accurate system for tendering… (emphasis ours)





The prime purpose of the Bill of Quantities (BOQ) is to enable all contractors tendering for a contract to price on exactly the same information/basis. Having it by lot without the quantities would give way to different estimates in terms of quantities.

III. GENERAL GUIDELINES



A)	 In compliance with Section 17 of DOLE D.O. No 13, the implementation of construction safety shall be considered in all stages of project procurement (design, estimate and construction) and its cost shall be integrated to the overall project cost under Pay Item “SPL-Construction Safety as a lump sum amount, to be quantified in the detailed estimate. . .”  (emphasis ours)

----media/image9.jpeg----



Check on the figures as computed by the bidder show that the total is P26,355,073.05 as against the TWG’S P26,499,029.36. Notice the erasures made which made this document erroneous which should have been taken as a red flag thus, needing proper attention.





Observations noted on the Documents submitted by the Winning Bidder which were not properly evaluated/checked/scrutinized by the TWG.

Based on the aforementioned photos, all those in the Organizational Chart which is specific for this Project are also at the same time working on three different projects in as follows:



Construction of Three (3) Storey Municipal Building in Bagumbayan, Davao Oriental;

1)	Concreting of Bakung-Maraning Road, Languyan, Tawi-Tawi; and

2)	Concreting of Basnunuk-Tubig Dakula-Jakarta Road, Languyan, Tawi-tawi



With these projects from different places, it would be impossible for the Key personnel to stay at the jobsite for the duration of the contract .



		3.  Other Observations noted on the Implementation of the Contract



a)		There was no evidence submitted that the Ten Percent (10%)  mobilization  Fee amounting to P2,635,507.31 was supported by an acceptable form of security with an equivalent value, thereby violating Section 4.2 of Annex “E”. 



Annex “E” Contract Implementation Guidelines for the Procurement of Infrastructure Projects provides-



“4. Advance Payment



	4.2. The advance payment shall be made only upon the submission to and acceptance by the procuring entity of an irrevocable standby letter of credit of equivalent value from a commercial bank, a bank guarantee or a surety bond callable upon demand, issued by a surety or insurance company duly licensed by the Insurance Commission and confirmed by the procuring entity.”

	

b)		There were changes in the personnel assigned in this project.  The Project Manager is now Flordeliza P. Sabate vice  Engr. Henry Sabate and Project Engineer from Engr. Edito D. Jualo to Engineer Jasper Nacilla with Engr. John Clarky T. Maturan as Assistant Project Engineer. 





The General Conditions of the Contract provides -

The Contractor’s Obligations

	1)	The Contractor shall employ the key personnel named in the Schedule of Key Personnel, as referred to in the SCC</a>, to carry out the supervision of the Works. The Procuring Entity will approve any proposed replacement of key personnel only if their relevant qualifications and abilities are equal to or better than those of the personnel listed in the Schedule.

	The University President’s approval on the replacements of the Project Manager and Project Engineer, including their qualifications to do the jobs required of them cannot be found from all the documents submitted.

The above observations put doubt on the propriety of the procurement process.



Recommendations:



In view hereof, we recommended that Management direct the BAC, BAC Secretariat, TWG to –



1)	 Submit all the documents as follows- 



a)	 Detailed Engineering;

b)	Copies of postings in the university website and conspicuous places;

c)	Invitation to Observers for all stages of the bidding process;

d)	Approval of the University President on the replacement of key personnel and their qualifications;

e)	Copy of the letter of credit of equivalent value from a commercial bank, a bank guarantee or a surety bond callable upon demand, issued by a surety or insurance company for the Mobilization Fee;

     

In case of failure to produce the above documents please justify why these cannot be done despite the requirements in RA 9184.



Justify the following:



a)			the BOQ and the Construction Safety and Health Program were not quantified;

		

b)	why allow the Performance Bond dated December 20, 2017 to be submitted seven (7) days after the Contract was entered into;



c)	NTP was prepared ahead of the Contract and the NOA ahead of the BAC Resolution Declaring the LCB and Recommending Approval;



d)	why review/evaluation were not meticulously done to avoid erroneous data or figures in the documents prepared; 



e)	why the CCKPCs were not properly evaluated such that key personnel would be rendering their assigned tasks in four (4) different places at the same time (including this contract) ; and



f)	Justify why this procurement process for the procurement of infrastructure project on the Construction of the 5 Storey CGB Building Phase IB should not be declared invalid for failure to comply with the mandatory requirements of RA 9184 and eventually be disallowed in audit.



Management’s Comment/s:



Management has already discussed the observation with Ar. Europa and for the latter to justify and also the BAC Secretary was also instructed to submit the required documents.



Auditor’s Rejoinder: 



This has been a recurring observation in the procurement of Infrastructure Projects.  The Audit Team shall continue to monitor Management’s compliance with the audit recommendations.



			

			COVID 19 Expenditures

			

			Obrero Campus

			

14)	Cash advances for COVID-19 related expenses in the total  amount of P16,489.00 were not spent or for the  specific purpose for which the cash advances were granted, so not in consonance with Section 89 of PD 1445 and therefore illegal.



Presidential Decree 1445 also known as the State Audit Code of the Philippines provides in part-



Section 89. Limitations on Cash Advance.  No cash advance shall be given unless for a legally authorized specific purpose. (emphasis ours)



"Section 128. Penal Provision. - Any violation of the provisions of Sections xx 89, xx of this code or any regulation issued by the Commission implementing these sections, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand pesos or by imprisonment not exceeding six (6) months, or both such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court." (emphasis ours)



Commission on Audit Circular No. 97-002 February 10, 1997



3.2 Special cash advances are those granted on the explicit authority of the Head of the Agency only to duly designated disbursing officers or employees for other legally authorized purposes. (emphasis ours)



8. RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AGENCY HEAD



It shall be the responsibility of the Head of the Agency to ensure the proper granting, and utilization of all cash advances in accordance with these rules and regulations.



Verifications of documents submitted for the Covid 19 expenses showed that cash advances were used for purposes other than what was authorized.



Accountable Officer

Amount of Cash Advance Granted

 Below is the authority for the grant of Cash Advances to Mesdames Magandi and Serafica indicating the specific purpose for their grant:



----media/image20.jpeg----



----media/image21.jpeg----



From the immediately preceding table, it is shown that the documentary stamps purchased was not part of the authority given to Ms. Magandi when she was granted the cash advance of P100,000.00.  While Ms. Serafica purchased three (3) units of Cellular Phones when her authority was for two (2) units only with no amount of cash advance to be granted. Nevertheless, such purchases are considered as illegal for violating a law, PD 1445.  



Annex “B” of COA Circular 2012-003 Cases that are considered Illegal Use or Expenditure of Government Funds and Property



12.  Use of funds intended for a specific purpose/project, for other purposes such as administrative and miscellaneous expenses…



15)	Reimbursement of expenses having a total amount of P 192,059.29 were not subjected to tax amounting to P8,912.07 in violation of BIR Revenue Regulations No. 11-2018 January 31, 2018, thereby depriving the government of an immediate additional income that may be used to finance its various projects.



REVENUE REGULATIONS NO. 11-2018 January 31, 2018



SECTION 2. Certain items of Section 2.57.2 of RR No. 2-98 is hereby renumbered and further amended to read as follows: 



“SECTION 2.57.2. Income Payments Subject to Creditable Withholding Tax and Rates Prescribed Thereon. – Except as herein otherwise provided, there shall be withheld a creditable income tax at the rates herein specified for each class of payee from the following items of income payments to persons residing in the Philippines: …



(J) Income Payments made by a government office, national or local, including barangays, or their attached agencies or bodies, and government-owned or controlled corporations to its local/resident supplier of goods/services, other than those covered by other rates of withholding tax. [formerly under letter (N)] – Income payments, except any single purchase which is P10,000 and below, which are made by a government office, national or local, including barangays, or their attached agencies or bodies, and government-owned or controlled corporations, on their purchases of goods and purchases of services from local/resident suppliers: 



Supplier of goods – One percent (1%) 

Supplier of services – Two percent (2%) . . .



	For purposes of these regulations, all income payments paid to sub-agents or their equivalent, whether paid directly or indirectly by the agent or the owner of the goods, shall be subject to withholding tax in the same manner as that of the agent. (emphasis ours)

	

	Any income subject to income tax may be subject to withholding tax; however, income exempt from income tax is consequently exempt from withholding tax. Further, income not subject to withholding tax does not necessarily mean that it is not subject to income tax.”



“SECTION 2.57.3. Persons Required to Deduct and Withhold. – xxx 



	The obligation to withhold is imposed upon the buyer-payor of income although the burden of tax is really upon the seller-income earner/payee; hence, unjustifiable refusal of the latter to be subjected to withholding shall be a ground for the mandatory audit of all internal revenue tax liabilities, as well as the imposition of penalties pursuant to Section 275 of the Tax Code, as amended, upon verified complaint of the buyer-payor.



RMO 23-2014 dated June 20, 2014 states in part-



II. OBLIGATION TO WITHHOLD ON PURCHASES OF GOODS AND SERVICES 



A)	Withholding Tax on Government Money Payments-



--		On purchases of goods and services from VAT registered suppliers/payees - Five percent (5%) of the gross payment 

	

	 On purchases of goods and services from non-VAT registered suppliers/payees – Three percent (3%) of the gross payment

	       (emphases ours)



Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 23-2007 dated March 20, 2007



	Purchases of the government that are covered by Purchase Orders duly signed by the authorized official/s as well as purchases using the Petty Cash Fund shall be subject to the 5% final VAT withholding. (emphasis ours)



	Audit showed that the following reimbursements were not subjected to the withholding taxes (Details in Annex “J”), viz:

Please note that this condition is recurring as the Audit Team has already informed management of this same non-payment of tax audit observation but the same violation is still committed, thus the University management may have intentionally disregarded  these BIR Rules and Regulations.



16)		Documents to support the Purchase of Alcohol Hand Sanitizer, Alcohol with dispenser and repair of water pump in the total amount of amount of P11,478.30 were dubious as the official receipts were dated earlier than the canvass, contrary to applicable provisions of RA 9184, thereby casting doubt on the veracity of the canvass made.

	

	Section 52 of RA9184 provides in part -

	

	        a)  Shopping under Section 52.1(a)

	

	 iii. The   RFQ  may  be sent directly to the supplier of known technical, legal and financial qualifications. Due to the attendant circumstances and the urgency  of  the  procurement,  the supplier shall immediately respond  to   the  RFQ and signify  its  technical,  legal and financial capability to supply and deliver the goods to be procured. . .

	

	

iv. The BAC shall immediately validate the technical, legal and financial capability   of   the  supplier   to   supply   and  deliver   the  goods  by requiring  the  submission of  relevant  documents  or  through    other verifiable means to prove the capability of the Supplier.  (emphasis ours)

	

	A cash advance was granted to Ms. Barnes in the amount of P4,900.00 for the purchase of Alcohol Sanitizers for the use of the Office of the President.  Among the  documents submitted to liquidate the cash advance was a Request For Quotation which was dated July 6, 2020 by the supplier but with no amount indicated thereon. Please refer to following snapshot:

	

	----media/image22.jpeg----

	

	

	 Further verification showed that the Official Receipt issued by Choice Mart was dated June 26, 2020.

	

----media/image23.jpeg----        ----media/image24.jpeg----



Based on the aforementioned documents, it is evident that the canvass was only simulated since the purchase was made ahead of the canvass, thereby violating RA9184 or the General Procurement Reform Act.



Also, in another Liquidation Report submitted by Ms. Barnes the following documents were noted, viz:



1)	 In the RFQ, reference to the Purchase Request is as follows:



  PR No. 2020-06-1997 dated June 6, 2020 



----media/image25.jpeg----



2)	Official Receipt using thermal paper of the Supplier which was not photocopied.



                       ----media/image26.jpeg----



3)	Since the thermal paper is no longer legible, reference was made to the   Inspection and Acceptance Report as shown below:



----media/image27.jpeg----



From the said snapshots, Purchase Request was dated June 6, 2020 as shown in the RFQ while the Invoice was dated June 5, 2020, as shown in the Inspection and Acceptance Report, again raising a red flag of simulation.



4)	In addition, the PR attached to the Cash Advance as shown below presented erasures on the number and date which are different from those in the RFQ.



----media/image28.jpeg----



In both instances, only one RFQ was secured for each procurement, although allowable but should have been checked and evaluated.



In another instant, documents to liquidate the cash advance for the repair and rewind of water pump motor were also doubtful as the Request for Quotation by the winning bidder was amended to match with their Cash Sales Invoice, which  also violated RA9184.



Perusal of the Purchase Request and Request for Quotation dated June 1, 2020 and June 3, 2020, respectively, show that items requisitioned were neither quantified nor the description of the same were not specific.



          Purchase Request                                 Request for Quotation

However,  the Request For Quotation and the Cash Sales Invoice of the winning bidder dated June 3, 2020 show the following:



a)	The last five unit Prices were added to the bid despite the absence of description as to what items these pertain to. The Cash Sales Invoice of JVC Aire Systems show that five items with prices, and these coincide with the Request for Quotation although no items were indicated to correspond to the prices offered by the JVC.



----media/image31.jpeg----    ----media/image32.jpeg----



From the documents above, to reconcile the nine (9) items delivered per cash sales invoice, five (5) prices were also added to the RFQ, which indicates a red flag since from the additions made it can be gathered that the bid canvass was only a  simulation. 



Based on the above observations, it is apparent that the somebody has been remiss in their duty of validating, checking and evaluating the  documents submitted specifically the RFQs since this  was considered even if it was blank or that amounts were added even if without item descriptions.



Simulated biddings violate RA9184, which is a law, and therefore illegal and should be disallowed in audit.



17)	Overpayment in the total amount of P320.45  was made to Chemtrust Global Market, Inc., thereby overstating the expense of the same amount.



Request For Quotation shows that the amount of bid was for P3,650.35 per gallon or a total of P47,454.55 for thirteen (13) gallons of Disinfectant Solution, viz:



,----media/image33.jpeg----



However, the Purchase Order and Charge Invoice show that the unit price is at P3,675.00 or a difference of P24.65  per gallon and P320.45 for 13 gallons.



Purchase Order 



----media/image34.jpeg----



Delivery Receipt



----media/image35.jpeg----



Please note that the Purchase Request amount is exactly the same as the Purchase Order and Delivery Receipt.



----media/image36.jpeg----



Having a PR with an amount that is exactly the same as the bid amount is also a red flag.



18)	No canvass paper was submitted to support its purchase of eleven (11) units of 16 liters knapsack sprayer from S. Herrera Bros. Inc. which is not in accordance with RA 9184. Moreover, delivered items were not in accordance with the specifications as stated in the PR.



	Again, Section 52 of RA9184 provides in part -

	

	        a)  Shopping under Section 52.1(a)

	

	 iii. The   RFQ  may  be sent directly to the supplier of known technical, legal and financial qualifications. Due to the attendant circumstances and the urgency  of  the  procurement,  the supplier shall immediately respond  to   the  RFQ and signify  its  technical,  legal and financial capability to supply and deliver the goods to be procured. . .

	

iv. The BAC shall immediately validate the technical, legal and financial capability   of   the  supplier   to   supply   and  deliver   the  goods  by requiring  the  submission of  relevant  documents  or  through    other verifiable means to prove the capability of the Supplier.  (emphasis ours)



From the Abstract of Bids, only three bidders signified their intention and submitted their RFQs to supply the needed Pressure Sprayer , as follows:



   ----media/image37.jpeg----



DDIS INC

DVO. CATHAY PARTS & HDWE

ST.PAUL’S AGREOCHEMICALS

P1,650.00

P2,900.00

P2,500.00

No stock on hand

Stainless-not plastic as requisitioned

No PhilGEPS Certificate









Considering the urgency of disinfecting the University, DDIS offer was rejected, Dvo. Cathay’s offer was for a stainless sprayer, therefore not per specification  and St. Paul is not registered with the PhlGEPS, hence, both offers were also rejected. 



However, no canvass paper was submitted for S. Herrera Bros., who supplied the Plastic Pressure Sprayer with a capacity of Sixteen (16) liters in the total amount of P9,900.00.



----media/image38.jpeg----





----media/image39.jpeg----



Please note that the PR was for a plastic sprayer with 10 liters capacity, but delivered was 16 liters capacity, therefore also not in accordance with the specifications as requisitioned, hence making S. Herrera Bros. also disqualified to supply the sprayer. 



We recommended the following courses of actions:



1)	Justify the following:



a)	Why purchases were made when these were not authorized since these were not specified in the Authority for the grant of cash advance and why these should not be disallowed in audit for being illegal;



b)	Why no taxes were withheld on payments made through reimbursements for amounts exceeding P10,000.00 in violation of BIR rules and regulations despite the previous AOM issued bearing on the same issue;



c)	Why the procurement processes were simulated and why these will not be disallowed in audit for violation of RA 9184; and



d)	Why S. Herrera Bros. supplied the Sprayer when no canvass paper was submitted and items delivered were not per specifications.



2)	Require the refund of the following unless justifications are valid and legal;



a)	 Overpayment made to Chemtrust Global Marketing;

b)	 Amount expended which is not for the specific purpose as authorized;

c)	 Taxes which were not withheld;

d)	 Simulated procurement processes; and

e)	 Delivered Sprayers was not per specification



Management’s Comment/s:



		1)	A revised authority for the grant of cash advance of P100,000.00 was issued for the purchase of storage boxes and documentary stamps, which unfortunately was not attached to the disbursement voucher.



		2)	Taxes were partially paid by employees concerned as follows:



Payee

            P 1,742.56

               2,040.00

Ma. Luz Serafica

               1,044.48



		3)	 On the purchases made by Ms. Barnes, only one justification was made stating that  PR being dated June 6, 2020 was actually June 5, 2020, the same date as the Official Receipts.



		4)	There was also confusion in the filling  in of some of the documents but the procedures were done in accordance with RA 9184, and all documents were properly prepared except that the amount in the RFQ was not properly filled up.



		5)	Overpayment amounting to P320.45 made to Chemtrust was refunded to the University thru the Cashier’s Unit.



		6)	Unnumbered Memorandum dated February 21, 2021 was issued to Dr. Rey Garcia and Mr. Ariel Pabilona reminding them to comment on the observations noted.





Auditor’s Rejoinder: 



		1)	 Submission of the revised Authority on the grant of cash advance is given due consideration.



		2)	 Payment of taxes was only partially complied.



		3)	 On the purchases made by Ms. Barnes - based on the RFQ, the date was June 6, 2020.  Please note that reference indicated in the RFQ came from the Purchase Request, it only differed because of the erasure made on the PR to coincide with the date of the Official Receipts.



     No justification was submitted on the other purchase made by Ms. Barnes which were also considered as simulated canvass/procurement process. Management is asked to justify, otherwise this will be disallowed in audit.



		4)	Purchase of parts for the repair and rewind of water pump motor was not properly justified. Management is asked to justify, otherwise this will also be disallowed in audit.





Tagum-Mabini Campuses



19)	Payments of COVID-19 Hazard Pay amounting to P544,500.00 were not supported with duly approved Office Order or any document authorizing the physical reporting of regular and Job Order employees during the period of an Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ), and payment of the same contravened DBM Circular 2020-1, hence resulting in uncertainty as to whether the employees concerned are legally entitled to receive such benefit. 



The grant of COVID-19 Hazard Pay to Regular /Casual Employees who physically report for work during the implementation of an Enhanced Community Quarantine was authorized under Section 1.1 of DBM Circular 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020, to wit:



	1)	Administrative Order (AO) No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 authorizes the grant of Hazard Pay, to be called as COVID-19 Hazard Pay, to government employees and workers engaged though contract of service (COS) or job order (JO) basis who physically report for work during the implementation of an Enhanced Community Quarantine in their respective work stations, in an amount not exceeding P500/day per person.



Said benefit shall be granted to the aforementioned government employees and workers since they are inevitable exposed to health risks and hazards if they physically report for work during the period of an Enhanced Community Quarantine. (emphasis ours)



In relation thereto, Section 4.0 of the same circular provides that the Head of Government Agencies may grant COVID-19 Hazard Pay to their personnel/workers without the need for further approval by the DBM, subject to the following conditions:



4.1 The COVID-19 Hazard Pay to be granted shall not exceed P500 /day per person, which shall be computed as follows:

COVID-19 Hazard Pay

=

P500

X

No. of Days Physically Reporting for Work During the Quarantine Period









4.2 The personnel are occupying regular, contractual or casual positions, or are workers engaged through COS, JO, or other similar schemes.



4.3 The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work at their respective officers or work stations on the prescribed official working hours by the head of agency/office during the period of implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine measures in the area of such office or work station. (emphasis supplied)



In addition, CSC MC No. 18, s, 2020  dated October 15, 2020 retroactively effective March 16, 2020 states in part -



	1)	Skeleton (Skeletal) Workforce



b. The employees assigned as skeleton workforce, during ECQ and MECQ, shall be issued the necessary travel/office orders, in addition to the office-issued IDs for proper identification;



The University paid COVID-19 Hazard Pay totaling P544,500.00 to its Regular and Job Order employees who have rendered physical reporting during the period of ECQ, covered by the following particulars:

Note:  * Net of P19,000.00





The Audit Team noted that the disbursement vouchers for the above transactions were not supported with duly approved Office Orders or Memorandum authorizing the physical reporting of regular (except for three employees) and job order employees concerned during the period of ECQ. 



Only three personnel who were issued Special Order by the University President were part of the USeP Covid 19 Action Center Team constituted to mitigate/fight the Covid 19 Pandemic in the University, hence, were considered as authorized to receive the Covid 

			1)	Hazard Pay, viz:



1)	Cesar A. Limbaga

Chancellor

P  7,000.00

1)	Kendi B. Arsitio

Logistics

    5,500.00

2)	Jet T. Caraga

Nurse

    6,500.00

Total

P19,000.00



It can be deduced from the foregoing provisions that the entitlement to the COVID-19 Hazard Pay requires at least two conditions: 



(1) Prior authority to render physical reporting during the period of ECQ as evidenced by an Office Order or memorandum for such purpose; and



(2) Actual physical reporting of concerned employees as supported by Individual Daily Time Records rendering the number of hours as prescribed by the head of agency. 



Apparently, Management is amiss in releasing the payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay whose corresponding disbursement vouchers were wanting of an Office Order or Memorandum to that effect. 



Further verification of Daily Time Records (Annex “K” for snapshots) supporting the said claims showed the following:

It can be observed that no proper review of the DTRs were made by those immediate supervisors of personnel concerned on the improper filling/non-filling up of the entries on the same which gives doubt as to whether the employee actually physically reported for work.



These transactions with aforementioned deficiencies in the Hazard Pay disbursements contravened the above cited provisions and casted uncertainty on the entitlement of these employees and personnel concerned to receive the COVID-19 Hazard Pay, hence may be suspended or disallowed in audit unless the personnel concerned especially those with unfilled entries show proof that they have worked in the campus during the prescribed hours.   



We recommended the following courses of actions to the Head of the Agency:

 

--	Require the personnel in the Human Resources Section to submit the approved Office Order or Memorandum authorizing the physical reporting of the employees and JO personnel; and



--	Require the refund from those found to be overpaid and unauthorized to receive the COVID 19 Hazard Pay upon further evaluation of their deficient DTRs.



Management’s Comment/s:



1)	The Acting Accountant justified her payment of the Covid 19Hazard Pay even without the attached Office Memo/Order;



2)	Memorandum No. 20200319-01 dated March 19, 2020 issued by the University President Re: Implementation of Full Work From Home Scheme Except for Offices Needing Skeletal Workforce and submission of Monitoring Report Twice a Week was Tagum-Campus’s basis for those who were required to render the physical duty serving as skeleton force. . . In general, they considered the said Memo as notice already to the concerned skeleton workforce.



3. There were entries in the DTR with incomplete 8-hour actual duty because they went home once the urgent official transaction done in the office was completed early and whatever functions deemed not finished within the day shall be done favorably at home having no time limit to take the official responsibility.  Not knowing before that granting such HAZARD PAY could affect the actual working hours being rendered by an employee. “We apologize of our incognizant to the conditions provided in the Budget Circular No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020 specifically on item no. 4.3.  What came to our attention in this circular is based on the number of days an employee/worker physically reports for work so entitled not considering the compliance of 8-hour duty.” (emphasis ours)



		5)	A schedule was prepared for each employee on when they are required to Report for Office or work from home, which they considered as their authority.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



Memorandum No. 20200319-01 dated March 19, 2020 issued by the University President is general in nature, only identifying the different offices that would be needing skeletal workforce. While CSC MC No. 18, s, 2020  dated October 15, 2020 retroactively effective March 16, 2020 is specific that Office Orders are to be issued for employees assigned as skeleton workforce.



Moreover, Memorandum No. 20200421-01 dated April 21, 2020 on the Grant of Covid 19 Hazard Pay issued by the University President further states “it is emphasized that only those employees who have been authorized by the head of the office to physically report at their work stations are granted the hazard pay . . . subject to the accounting and auditing rules.  Authorized employees should report during the prescribed official working hours. . .”  (emphasis ours) 



From this memo, it can be gleaned that the University Chancellor can pay the said benefit only to those whom he specifically authorized to physically report at their work stations and during the prescribed working hours. 





      Senior Citizen and Differently Abled

21. The approved Gad Plan  and Budget (GPB) allocation which was adjusted and allowed by the Philippines Commission on Women (PCW) was only 1.12% or P5,241,000.00 of the Agency’s budget, however, GAD expenses with attributions amounted only to P1,286,493.08 or 24% of the approved GPB, thus not fully addressing the GAD issues as planned.



	Perusal of the initial GAD Accomplishment Report showed that the total cost with attributions of the GAD activities amounted only to P1,286,493.08 or 24% of the P5.2M  of the GPB as adjusted and approved by the PCW.



	Despite the decrease in the GPB allocation, management was still not able to accomplish their targets. The implementation of activities was limited due to the pandemic, wherein most of GAD Office's activities were conducted virtually.



	The Audit Team is giving due consideration on the very minimal accomplishments submitted by Management to address GAD related issues since they are at present under community quarantine wherein movements/contact of persons are very limited to prevent the spread of the Corona Virus 19.











Taxes withheld and remitted for CY 2020



  22. Failure of the person in charge to monthly reconcile the withholding and  remittance of taxes resulted to its under remittances in the total amounts of P6,121,102.28 and P1,230,695.14, for Obrero and Tagum Campuses, respectively and over remittance of  P1,074,205.24 for Mintal Campus.



The Audit Team was able to verify the tax remittances for Obrero, Tagum and Mintal Campuses only since Bislig Campus has only submitted until January 2020 vouchers due to quarantine restrictions. 



The University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) withheld taxes from suppliers and compensation for the year 2020 inclusive of prior year’s balance. However, per audit there were over and unremitted taxes. Details are as follows:

Recommendation:



We recommended that the personnel concerned immediately settle all disallowances and suspensions pursuant to Sections 48, 51 and 82 of P.D. No. 1445.

	

	

26. Other Observations which were immediately acted/commented upon by Management and considered closed/implemented:

	

1)		Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation (AAPSI) with reference to the Audit Observations and Recommendations for the Calendar Year 2019 including those of the prior years’ were not submitted by Management contrary to Section 89 of RA 11465 or the General Appropriations Act of 2020, thus precluding the Auditor from conducting validation.

	

	Management has complied by submitting their AAPSI on August 20, 2020.

	

2)		CY 2018 Performance-Based Bonus (PBB) in the total amount of P6,657.50 was paid to the Special Disbursing Officer (SDO) whose cash advances were not liquidated pursuant to COA Circular No. 97-002 as reiterated in COA Circular No. 2009-002, Executive Order No. 77 and further contravening Memorandum Circular No. 2018-1 on the Grant of PBB for CY 2018, therefore raising questions whether the grant may have been irregular.

	

	Mintal Campus Management was able to justify their granting of the PBB despite the failure of the Accountable Officer to liquidate on time and due consideration was afforded them considering that there was no negligence on the part of the accountable officer.

	

3)	Non-submission of  Reports on the Physical Count for Inventory  and for Plant Property and Equipment by Obrero Campus Inventory Committee amounting to P17,551,069.90 and P261,379,146.48,  respectively and  by Tagum Campus Inventory Committee for Plant Property and Equipment in the amount of P32,847,518.47 rendered the reported Inventory and PPE balances unreliable contrary to the Government Accounting Manual (GAM).

	

	Obrero Inventory Committee was able to submit their CY 2019 Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) on February 12, 2020, while Tagum Inventory Committee was able to submit their CY 2019 and CY 2020 	RCPPE on December 14, 2020 and February 8, 2021, respectively.
