Dear Director Cuñado: 
 

Management Letter on the Audit of the 
Environmental Management Bureau 

For the period January 1 to December 31, 2020 
 
 

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
1. Pursuant to Section 2, Article IX-D of the Constitution of the Philippines and 

Section 43 of the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines or Presidential 
Decree (PD) No. 1445, we have conducted the financial audit with compliance to 
other legal and regulatory requirements on the accounts and transactions of the 
Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) Central Office (CO) and 15 
Regional Offices (ROs) for the period ended December 31, 2020. However, the 
complete results of the financial audit cannot be incorporated in this report in view 
of the non-submission of the Consolidated Financial Statements for CY 2020 and 
its integral parts where an audit opinion could be rendered. The audit was 
conducted in accordance with the International Standards of Supreme Audit 
Institutions (ISSAIs). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain a reasonable basis for our conclusions. 

 
2. The audit was conducted to: (a) determine the propriety of transactions as well as 

the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (b) 
recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (c) determine the extent of 
implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations. The examination on the 
level of assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial 
statements was not fully undertaken due to the non-availability of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 

 
3. We wish to bring to your attention the consolidated audit observations and 

recommendations of the Audit Teams of the EMB CO and 15 ROs, which were

earlier communicated through their respective Management Letters and discussed 
with the concerned EMB officials and employees during the virtual exit conference 
held on May 20, 2021. Management’s comments were incorporated therein, where 
appropriate. 

 
4. This Management Letter is issued in lieu of the Consolidated Annual Audit Report.

Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 
Financial Audit 
 
9. The Bureau failed to submit the Consolidated Trial Balances with Supporting 

Schedules, and Financial Statements (FSs) with the corresponding Notes to FS for 
the Year Ended December 31, 2020, as required under Sections 41 and 122 of PD 
No. 1445 and Section 60, Chapter 19 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) 
for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, thus, prevented the Auditor 
to express an audit opinion on the FSs of the Agency. Likewise, the objectives of 
general-purpose financial reporting in the public sector, which is to provide 
information useful for decision making was not achieved. (Paragraph 35) 
 

10. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountant of the 
Bureau to strictly comply with the submission of Consolidated Trial Balances with 
Supporting Schedules, and Financial Statements with the corresponding Notes to 
FS to the Office of the Auditor in accordance with the timelines provided for in the 
Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume I. 

 
11. Also, institute administrative sanctions to the Chief, Administrative, Financial and 

Management Division (AFMD), Chief Accountant and all other concerned 
personnel of the AFMD for their failure to submit the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and its integral parts to the auditor concerned for audit, taking into 
consideration that this problem had been in existence for quite a long time even 
before the pandemic, in pursuant to Sections 41 and 122 of PD No. 1445. 

 
Compliance with Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Audit 
 
12. Overall, the EMB’s fund utilization/obligation of ₱2.263 billion is 95 percent 

compared to its allotment of ₱2.375 billion during the year with a balance of 
allotment of ₱112.127 million due to procurement activities that were not pursued 
brought about by the imposed restrictions/limitations due to the Covid-19 
pandemic. Also, the Implementation of Ecological Solid Waste Management 
Regulations (ESWMR) registered a fund utilization of ₱297.060 million or 95 
percent of its available allotment of ₱313.429 million, of which ₱6.915 million 
were inconsistent with the purpose of appropriation/allotment. (Paragraph 47) 
 

13. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Heads of the Operations of 
EMB CO to: 

 
a. identify the affected projects/activities resulting in the lapsing of FY 2019 

continuing appropriation, and resolve any adverse effects thereon; and 
 

b. onwards, be vigilant in the preparation of budget proposal to prevent the 
lapsing of allotment and non-implementation of planned activities for the 
ultimate attainment of the Agency Programs’ goals and objectives.

14. Also, we recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief, 
Administrative, Financial and Management Division (AFMD) of EMB CO to 
instruct the Chief, Budget Section to obligate expenditures in accordance with the 
approved allotment and intended purpose only. 
 

15. Ten EMB ROs have no dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary special 
and trust funds and related accounts for reversion as of year-end while the trust 
receipts from performance bonds and bid documents during the year amounting to 
₱9.407 million in EMB CO and National Capital Region (NCR) were not deposited 
to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr), which is not in accordance with the Permanent 
Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012, dated September 11, 2012, implementing EO 
No. 431, dated May 30, 2005 and Sections 6 and 7 of the General Provisions of the 
2020 GAA. (Paragraph 70) 

 
16. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief, AFMD/FAD of: 

 
a. EMB CO and NCR to instruct the Cashiers to deposit all collections for trust 

receipts to the BTr, which shall be accounted for as Cash, Treasury/Agency 
Deposit-Trust; and 

 
b. EMB CO to implement the immediate reversion and closure of the PS 

Miscellaneous account by depositing its entire amount with the BTr under the 
Cash, Treasury/Agency Deposit-Trust pursuant to Item No. II. B. of the 
Treasury Circular No. 01-2013 dated January 23, 2013. 

 
17. Cash advances granted during the year for operating expenses, official local and 

foreign travels and special purpose/time-bound undertakings in 10 EMB ROs 
amounting to ₱26.535 million were liquidated at year-end, except EMB CO and 
NCR amounting to ₱6.099 million or 76 percent of the cash advances granted 
during the year of ₱8.037 million, which were not liquidated as of December 31, 
2020. Also, in RO XI the unliquidated prior year balance of ₱0.005 million was 
already liquidated as of year-end. Moreover, the approved amount of fidelity bond 
of the accountable officer/Cashier in the amount of ₱0.500 million in EMB NCR 
was insufficient to cover her maximum accountability. (Paragraph 82) 
 

18. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 
a. direct the Chief, AFMD/FAD of EMB CO and NCR to strictly enforce 

liquidation of outstanding cash advances within the prescribed period by 
sending demand letters to the officials and employees concerned and issuing 
order of payments, in case of failure to settle their cash advances when due 
for liquidation; 

 
b. require the Chief Accountants of EMB CO and NCR to ensure that complete 

and updated subsidiary ledgers are maintained using the available 



5 
 

documents/reports to record the details of transactions recorded in the GL; 
and 

 
c. direct the Chief, FAD of EMB NCR to strictly ensure that the cash handled 

by the accountable officer at any point in time does not exceed the maximum 
accountability for the approved amount of bond by applying for the increase 
of her fidelity bond to sufficiently cover the accountability. 

 
19. Fund transfers to implementing agencies and NGOs/POs of nine EMB ROs during 

the year for the implementation of agency’s projects amounting to ₱21.993 million 
or 100 percent of the funds transferred were not liquidated at year end. Also, there 
were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years amounting to ₱721.739 million 
or 76 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱952.423 million of EMB CO and 13 EMB 
ROs. (Paragraph 94) 

 
20. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations with modification and 

Management agreed to instruct the: 
 

a. Chief, AFMD/FAD and Accountants of: 
 

i. EMB CO and NCR to review and assess the functions and responsibilities 
of the personnel under their respective Accounting Sections to address the 
heavy work load; 
 

ii. EMB CO, NCR, CAR, I, II, V, VI, VII, X, and XII to send demand letter 
regularly to concerned IAs and NGOs/POs and to strengthen its 
monitoring controls in the liquidation of fund transfers to ensure timely 
submission of liquidation documents, that reconciliation with the IA’s 
records is facilitated and immediate refund of the unutilized fund for 
completed projects, if any; 
 

b. Chief, Solid Waste Management Division or designated monitoring 
team/focal persons of EMB NCR, CAR, I, V, X, XI to closely monitor the 
progress of the projects and its conformance with the provisions indicated in 
the MOA, specifically on the target date of completion and require the LGUs 
to fast track completion of these projects so that the services/benefits that 
could be derived therefrom can be extended to the targeted end-users and the 
funds transfers can be liquidated immediately; 

 
c. Ecological Solid Waste Management Section (ESWMS) of EMB RO III to: 

 
i. revisit the provisions of the MOA and consider the inclusion of 

implementation end-date and penalty clause that may impel or constrain 
the timely performance of the LGUs or the termination and cancellation of 
the agreement including the recovery of funds for reprogramming, if 
warranted; and 



6 
 

ii. instruct the monitoring team to establish the existence of the projects 
funded from the fund transfers and to obtain the liquidation reports from 
LGUs with respect to completed projects and the return of excess and idle 
funds to BTr; 

 
d. FAD and SWMS of EMB RO VI to: 

 
i. coordinate with the LGUs on the revision of the WFP due to approved 

request for extension of project implementation; 
 

ii. prepare/execute amended MOA considering the time table which had 
already elapsed or nearing expiration; and   

 
iii. demand for the immediate refund of the financial assistance for those who 

have not yet implemented the project despite the grant of extension of the 
timetable, and which had already expired at the end of the year; 

 
e. Monitoring Team of EMB RO XI to submit an updated report on the status 

and results of the inspection and evaluation of the funded projects as of 
December 31, 2020 to the COA audit team; 

 
f. OIC - Environmental Monitoring and Enforcement Division (EMED) of EMB 

RO XIII to make representation or hold dialogue with the concerned Local 
Chief Executives, Project Coordinators and their Accountants to identify 
problems in the non-liquidation of fund transfers; and 

 
g. Accountants of EMB CO, ROs NCR, CAR, I, II, III, IV-A, V, VI, VII, X, XI, 

XII and XIII, in case the concerned IAs still failed to comply with the 
settlement of unliquidated amount, to issue Final Letter of Demand to each 
IAs and furnish COA of the proof of service of said demand letter. 

 
21. EMB ROs III, VI and XIII had no fund transfers to Procurement Service-

Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) and Philippine International 
Trade Center (PITC) for its common office supplies and equipment requirement 
during the year. However, EMB CO, ROs NCR, IV-A, VII and XI fund transfers to 
PS-DBM for its common-use supplies and airline tickets amounting to ₱9.425 
million, of which 84 percent of the total funds transferred during the year were not 
liquidated at year end. Also, no liquidations for prior year’s balance of fund 
transfers to PS-DBM and PITC amounting to ₱647.197 million and ₱401.835 
million, respectively. (Paragraph 105) 
 

22. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. instruct the Chief, AFMD/FAD, Chief Accountant and Property/Supply 
Officers of EMB CO, NCR and IV-A to coordinate with PS-DBM to 
reconcile the remaining difference between their respective books and 



7 
 

demand for the delivery of undelivered goods, if not seek refund of said 
amount to the BTr; 
 

b. require the Supply Officer of EMB NCR to submit regularly to the 
Accounting Unit all the delivery receipts (DRs) and its supporting documents 
for the delivered supplies and materials in order to properly record in the 
books the deliveries of goods from PS-DBM in a timely manner; 
 

c. require the Accountants of EMB ROs VII and XI to coordinate with the PS-
DBM as regard the unliquidated fund transfers/initial deposits on airline 
tickets thru the Government Fares Agreement (GFAs); and 
 

d. direct the Chief AFMD of EMB CO to send demand letter to PITC for the 
immediate liquidation of outstanding prior year’s fund transfers. 
 

23. Nine ROs have no dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and 
fund transfers for write-off while in EMB XI, a request for write-off of dormant 
Other Receivables account amounting ₱0.030 million was submitted to the 
Auditor’s Office in December 2020 for evaluation. On the other hand, dormant 
receivable accounts and unliquidated fund transfers amounting to ₱4.951 million in 
EMB CO and RO I were not requested for write-off. (Paragraph 116) 
 

24. We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief, AFMD/FAD of 
EMB CO and RO I to prioritize the filing of a request for authority to write-off for 
dormant accounts that are deemed uncollectible, after all remedies have been 
exhausted, in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 
2016. 
 

25. EMB CO and nine ROs insured with the Government Service Insurance System 
(GSIS) property amounting to ₱1.232 billion with corresponding insurance 
premiums paid in the amount of ₱5.344 million. However, various PPE in ROs III, 
V, VII, X and XII amounting to ₱349.089 million were not insured, thus, the 
agency is at risk of not being indemnified in case of damage or loss of property. 
(Paragraph 123) 
 

26. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Property Officers of EMB 
ROs III, VII, X and XII to insure all insurable physical assets and properties with 
the GSIS to have an adequate and reliable protection against any damage to or loss 
of properties pursuant to RA No. 656. 
 

27. Also, we recommended and Management of RO V agreed to require the 
Supply/Property Officer to prepare and submit the Property Inventory Form as 
required under COA Circular No. 2018-002 in order to determine the accuracy of 
the insurance coverage of the EMB Region V properties. 
 

28. EMB RO II has no unserviceable property as of year-end while EMB ROs I, III, 
VI, and XI have disposed of their unserviceable properties, in compliance with 



8 
 

Section 79 of PD No. 1445. While unserviceable property with a total cost of 
₱38.864 million in EMB CO, ROs NCR, VII and XIII and undetermined amount in 
RO V remained not disposed of, thus, exposing them to further deterioration and 
decreasing their realizable value. (Paragraph 131) 
 

29. We recommended and Management agreed to order the Property Officers and 
Disposal Committee of EMB CO, NCR, V, VII and XIII to institute the necessary 
measures to properly dispose all the obsolete and unserviceable properties pursuant 
to Section 79 of PD No. 1445; and Property Officers of EMB NCR and V to list 
down all obsolete and unserviceable PPE with complete data in the Inventory and 
Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) and submit to the Disposal 
Committee for proper disposition, in accordance with Section 40.d. Chapter 10, 
Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. 
 

30. Copies of 1,158 government contracts, purchase orders (POs) and their supporting 
documents amounting to ₱107.902 million of EMB ROs CAR, I, II, IV-A, VI and 
XI were submitted within the prescribed period and the same were verified to be 
complete and in order. While copies of 601 government contracts, purchase orders 
and their supporting documents of EMB CO, ROs NCR, III, V, X and XIII with 
corresponding amount of ₱397.756 million were not submitted within the 
prescribed period, with delays ranging from one to 218 days. (Paragraph 140) 
 

31. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the: 
 
a. Human Resource Management Development Section (HRMDS) of EMB CO 

and NCR to assess/evaluate the duties and responsibilities of the staff 
concerned in order to ensure equitable distribution of workload, which 
includes the submission of copies of POs/contracts by the Property and 
General Services Section/Property and Procurement Management Unit/Bids 
and Awards Committee (PGSS/PPMU/BAC) Secretariat, and to remind them 
to efficiently perform their assigned duties and responsibilities; 
 

b. PGSS/Procurement Unit/BAC Secretariat of EMB CO, NCR, III, V, X and 
XIII to strictly comply with the submission of the authenticated copies of 
contracts/POs and all their pertinent documents to the Office of the Auditor 
pursuant to COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009; 
 

c. Property Officer of EMB CO to pre-number or create a monitoring system for 
all the contracts entered into by the EMB CO to facilitate tracking of 
documents and ensure full accounting/monitoring; and 
 

d. Procurement Unit/Supply Officer of ROs V and XIII to indicate the dates in 
all perfected contracts/POs as required for reckoning of the effectivity of the 
contracts/POs and for purposes of liquidated damages in compliance with 
procurement laws, rules and regulations.

32. The consolidated observations and recommendations were discussed with the 
concerned officials during the exit conference conducted on May 20, 2021. Their 
comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

 
Enforcement of Settlement of Accounts 
 
33. For CY 2020, the EMB was able to settle ₱28.320 million or 49.87 percent of the 

total audit suspensions of ₱56.784 million. For audit disallowances, only ₱0.629 
million or 1.76 percent was settled out of ₱35.782 million while for audit charges 
only ₱0.015 million or 50 percent was settled out of ₱0.030 million, leaving 
unsettled suspensions, disallowances and charges of ₱28.464 million, ₱35.153 
million, and ₱0.015 million, respectively. 

 
Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 
34. Out of the 31 prior years’ audit recommendations, 12 were implemented and 19 

were not implemented as of December 31, 2020, of which 14 were reiterated in this 
report. 

 
 

III. AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
A. Financial Audit 
 
Non-submission of Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
35. The Bureau failed to submit the Consolidated Trial Balances with Supporting 

Schedules, and Financial Statements (FSs) with the corresponding Notes to FS 
for the Year Ended December 31, 2020, as required under Sections 41 and 122 
of PD No. 1445 and Section 60, Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus, 
prevented the Auditor to express an audit opinion on the consolidated FSs of 
the Agency. Likewise, the objectives of general-purpose financial reporting in 
the public sector, which is to provide information useful for decision making 
was not achieved. 
 

36. Section 41 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides the following: 
 

Xxx 
 

(2) To carry out the purposes of this section, the chief accountant or the 
official in charge of keeping the accounts of a government agency shall 
submit to the Commission year-end trial balances and such other 
supporting or subsidiary statements as may be required by the 
Commission not later than the fourteenth day of February. Trial 
balances returned by the Commission for revision due to non-



10 
 

compliance with accounting rules and regulations, shall be resubmitted 
within three days after the date of receipt by the official concerned. 
 
(3) Failure on the part of any official or employee to comply with the 
provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph shall cause the 
automatic suspension of the payment of his salary and other emoluments 
until he shall have complied there with. The violation of these provisions 
for at least three times shall subject the offender to administrative 
disciplinary action. 

 
37. Also, Section 122 of PD No. 1445 states that: 

 
Submission of reports. Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of 
the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it require 
the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, 
disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, and other 
responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, 
physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such 
other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions. 
 
(2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the 
documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the 
suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have complied 
with the requirements of the Commission. 
 

38. Pertinent provisions under Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual 
(GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I provide the 
following: 

 
Section 3. Purpose of Financial Statements. It states that: 
 
a. “Financial statements are a structured representation of the 

financial position and financial performance of an entity. The 
objectives of general-purpose financial statements are to provide 
information about the financial position, financial performance, and 
cash flows of an entity that is useful to a wide -range of users in 
making and evaluating decisions about the allocation of resources. 
Specifically, the objectives of general-purpose financial reporting in 
the public sector should be to provide information useful for 
decision making, and to demonstrate the accountability of the entity 
for the resources entrusted to it, xx” 

 
Section 5. Components of Financial Statements. It states that: 
 
“A complete set of financial statements (condensed and by fund cluster) 
to be submitted by an entity shall include the following: 



11 
 

a. Statement of Financial Position (SFP) (Annex A); 
b. Statement of Financial Performance (SFPer) (Annex B);  
c. Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity (SCNA/E) (Annex C); 
d. Statement of Cash Flows (SCF) (Annex D); 
e. Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amount (SCBAA) 
(Annex E); and  
f. Notes (Annex F), comprising a summary of significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory notes. (Par. 21, IPSAS 1).” 

 
Section 60 sets the deadlines on submission of these financial statements. It 
provides that “All NGAs shall prepare and submit the following financial 
statements and schedules xxx, within the prescribed deadline.” 
 
Particularly quoted below is the responsibility and deadline pertaining to the 
year-end reports: 
 

Entity/Office Statement/Report Deadline Submit to: 
    

Regional/ Year-end TBs, FSs, On or before Regional Auditor, 
Branches SSs (Combined RO January 31 Central Office 
Offices And OUs) of the  Chief Accountant 
  following year  
    

    
Central/Head/ Year-end TBs, FSs, February 14 COA Auditor, DBM, 
Main Offices SSs (Combined CO, following COA-GAS” 
Entity Office ROs and OUs) year  

 
39. To date, the combined Trial Balances (TBs), financial statements (FSs) of the CO 

and its Regional Offices and supporting schedules (SS) for the year ended 
December 31, 2020 were not yet submitted to the COA, contrary to Section 60, 
Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 
 

40. Nevertheless, it was agreed upon during the Exit Conference on March 23, 2021 
that the submission of the combined TBs, FSs and SSs (per Fund and All Funds) 
should have been on April 15, 2021, effecting also the adjustments on the errors 
and omissions not yet taken up in the books by revising the FSs as of December 31, 
2020 of the EMB Central Office (CO) and in the combined FSs. 
 

41. Several verbal follow-ups and email to the Accounting Section on April 15, 2021 
were made but still the subject combined TBs, FSs and SSs are not yet received to 
date. According to the Bureau Chief Accountant, there are still data/information for 
confirmation to various EMB ROs, thus, he informed the audit team to submit the 
consolidated FSs on April 26, 2021 but still not submitted to date. Also, during    



12 
 

the exit conference, the individual FSs from the ROs were already submitted but 
the EMB-CO Accounting Section had difficulty in consolidating the FSs per Fund 
due to their first-time to do it and failed to prepare the same in 2019. 
 

42. Thus, audit opinion cannot be rendered by the Auditor on the Combined FSs as of 
December 31, 2020 due to the absence of consolidated FSs. Also, the Agency’s 
financial condition, results of operations, status of sources and application of funds 
for CY 2020 could not be presented. 
 

43. Likewise, the objectives of general-purpose financial reporting in the public sector, 
which is to provide information useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the 
accountability of the entity for the resources entrusted to it, were not achieved since 
the financial statements were not provided in a timely manner as needed in decision 
making. Therefore, the delayed preparation of the FSs by EMB deprived the 
intended users for its use in decision making. 
 

44. It should also be noted that the Combined FSs were mentioned in AOM No. 2021-
003 dated January 12, 2021 requiring for the submission on or before the final due 
date on February 14, 2021. 
 

45. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountant of 
the Bureau to strictly comply with the submission of Consolidated Trial 
Balances with Supporting Schedules, and Financial Statements with the 
corresponding Notes to FS to the Office of the Auditor in accordance with the 
timelines provided for in the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, 
Volume I. 
 

46. Also, institute administrative sanctions to the Chief, Administrative, Financial 
and Management Division (AFMD), Chief Accountant and all other concerned 
personnel of the AFMD for their failure to submit the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and its integral parts to the auditor concerned for audit, taking 
into consideration that this problem had been in existence for quite a long time 
even before the pandemic, in pursuant to Sections 41 and 122 of PD No. 1445. 

 
B. Compliance with Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Audit 
 
Fund Utilization/obligation 
 
47. Overall, the EMB’s fund utilization/obligation of ₱2.263 billion is 95 percent 

compared to its allotment of ₱2.375 billion during the year with a balance of 
allotment of ₱112.127 million due to procurement activities that were not 
pursued brought about by the imposed restrictions/limitations due to the 
Covid-19 pandemic. Also, the Implementation of Ecological Solid Waste 
Management Regulations (ESWMR) registered a fund utilization of    
₱297.060 million or 95 percent of its available allotment of ₱313.429 million, of 



13 
 

which ₱6.915 million were inconsistent with the purpose of 
appropriation/allotment. 
 

48. To facilitate various government agencies’ fulfillment of its mandate, the National 
Budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 was approved through the Republic Act (RA) 
No. 11465, also known as the General Appropriations Act (GAA) FY 2020, which 
states in its General Provisions that: 

 
Sec. 60. Cash Budgeting System. All appropriations authorized in this 
Act…. shall be available for release and disbursement for the purpose 
specified, and under the same general and special provisions applicable 
thereto, until December 31, 2020. 
 

49. Also, National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated January 6, 2020 or the 
guidelines on the release of funds for FY 2020, Item 3.5 provides that: 

 
“Pursuant to RA 11464, an Act Extending the Availability of the FY 
2019 Appropriations to December 31, 2020, amending for the Purpose 
Section 65 of the General Provisions of R.A. No. 11260, the General 
Appropriations Act of Fiscal Year 2019, the guidelines prescribed under 
item 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 hereof shall apply.” 

 
50. Item 3.4.1 of the same NBC states that: 

 
“The appropriations for the following items under the FY 2020 GAA 
shall be valid for obligation until December 31, 2020: 

 
3.4.1.1 Infrastructure Capital Outlays (CO), including subsidy releases 

to GOCCs for infrastructure projects; 
 

3.4.1.2 MOOE and other CO items.” 
 

51. The Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and 
Balances (SAAODB) or Financial Accountability Report (FAR) No. 1 for Calendar 
Year (CY) 2020 showed that out of total allotment available of ₱2.375 billion, 
₱2.263 billion or 95 percent were utilized/obligated, leaving an unutilized allotment 
of ₱112.127 million, shown as follows:

Total 2,375.088 2,262.961 112.127 95 

MOOE-Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses 
 

52. For the current year’s appropriations, the utilization rate of 96 percent is attributed 
to the unobligated allotment of the MOOE and CO amounting to ₱60.514 million 
and ₱7.303 million, respectively under the Operations or 72 percent of the ₱94.637 
million where procurement activities were not pursued due to the Covid-19 
pandemic. Thus, activities as well as the appropriated allotment will be forwarded 
to the next FY as continuing appropriation. 

 
53. More so, Management registered a low utilization rate of 89 percent from the 

Continuing Appropriations of 2019, leaving an unutilized allotment of ₱17.490 
million, which has already lapsed and no longer available for obligation after 
December 31, 2020. The delayed implementation of the projects/activities was due 
to the Agency’s decision to prioritize the implementation of activities funded from 
the Current Year Appropriations. 

 
54. Thus, the overall fund utilization rate of only 95 percent has been affected by the 

obligated allotment for Continuing Appropriations of only 89 percent and 96 
percent for Current Year Appropriations. 
 

55. On the other hand, the EMB reported a fund utilization of ₱297.060 million or 95 
percent out of available allotment of ₱313.429 million during the year under the 
Implementation of the Ecological Solid Waste Management Regulations 
(ESWMR), one of the projects/activities under the Environmental Regulations and 
Pollution Control Program.

56. In EMB CO, of the allotted amount of ₱52.166 million for the Implementation of 
ESWMR in FY 2020 GAA, ₱44.545 million or 85.39 percent was 
obligated/utilized during the year, of which the amount of ₱6.915 million or 15.52 
percent were obligated/utilized even though inconsistent with the provisions of FY 
2020 GAA. 
 

57. Various mandatory expenses such as Utility Expenses, Communications Expenses, 
Professional Services, General Services, Repairs and Maintenance and Supplies and 
Materials Expenses under the Responsibility Center of General 
Administration/Mandatory were obligated from the budget of the Implementation 
of ESWMR. It should be noted that budget for Operations should be used only for 
the corresponding expenditures that relate to the main purpose for which an agency 
has been created and it involves direct production of goods or delivery of services 
or direct engagement in regulations. While General Management and Supervision 
(GMS) is a cost component of the budget, which consists of the activities and 
projects dealing with the provision of overall administrative management and 
operational support to the entire agency operations. 
 

58. However, expenses totaling ₱6.915 million, which were supposed to be chargeable 
against the GMS were charged to the allotment for the Implementation of ESWMR, 
which are considered improper charges to the allotment. 
 

59. It should be emphasized that in Section 60 of the General Provisions of the FY 
2020 GAA, it was provided that appropriations shall be obligated for the purpose 
specified and under special provisions applicable thereto. 
 

60. The Management commented that a big portion of the lapsed allotment for 
Continuing Appropriation is for High Level Seminar on Sustainable Cities 
amounting to ₱5M, which did not materialize since meetings and seminars were 
reduced to virtual platforms due to the pandemic. 
 

61. Further, some Purchase Requests (PRs) for consultancy services came in December 
2020, thus these were not anymore pursued due to time constraint for the bidding 
process and the extension of the validity of 2020 appropriation was not yet 
approved. 
 

62. Mandatory and general administrative expenses are fixed expenditures like utilities 
and maintenance for buildings, vehicles and office equipment that the agency 
incurs. Small portion of budget for most program, activity and projects (PAPs) has 
an allocation intended for these expenditures since the GMS has only a small 
budget to accommodate the budgetary requirements for these expenditures. 
 

63. However, the Management still failed to fully identify the affected 
projects/activities resulting in the lapsing of FY 2019 continuing appropriation. 

 



16 
 

64. Also, changing the purpose of the PAP’s allotment may result in allotment 
modification as embodied in Item 5.2 of the DBM National Budget Circular No. 
758 dated January 6, 2020 or the Guidelines on the Release of Funds for FY 2020. 
However, in this case no Modification Advice Form (MAF) was issued modifying 
the purpose of the allotment. 
 

65. Moreover, the Management should have been vigilant in the preparation of its 
budget proposal. The sufficiency of allocation for the GMS expenses should have 
been established and distinguished from the expenses of the ESWMR to ensure 
propriety of expenditures and for transparency and accountability purposes. 
 

66. Thus, the Agency did not fully comply with the said provision as regards the full 
utilization of funds and the charging of obligations for specific purpose only. 
 

67. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Heads of the 
Operations of EMB CO to: 
 
a. identify the affected projects/activities resulting in the lapsing of FY 2019 

continuing appropriation, and resolve any adverse effects thereon; and 
 
b. onwards, be vigilant in the preparation of budget proposal to prevent the 

lapsing of allotment and non-implementation of planned activities for the 
ultimate attainment of the Agency Programs’ goals and objectives. 

 
68. Also, we recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief, AFMD of 

EMB CO to instruct the Chief, Budget Section to obligate expenditures in 
accordance with the approved allotment and intended purpose only. 

 
Cash utilization/disbursements 
 
69. The total cash allocation of ₱2.239 billion received during the year was 93 percent 

utilized/disbursed, leaving a balance of ₱161.446 million that was reverted to the 
BTr due to delayed deliveries of goods and services and procurement 
activities/other activities not pursued in CY 2020 brought about by the imposed 
restrictions/limitations due to Covid-19 pandemic, which was beyond the control of 
Management. 

 
Reversion of dormant cash, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary fund 
 
70. Ten EMB ROs have no dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary 

special and trust funds and related accounts for reversion as of year-end while 
the trust receipts from performance bonds and bid documents during the year 
amounting to ₱9.407 million in EMB CO and NCR were not deposited to the 
BTr which is not in accordance with the Permanent Committee Joint Circular 
No. 4-2012, dated September 11, 2012, implementing EO No. 431, dated May 
30, 2005 and Sections 6 and 7 of the General Provisions of the 2020 GAA. 



17 
 

71. The Department of Finance, Department of Budget and Management and 
Commission on Audit (DOF-DBM-COA) Permanent Committee Resolution No. 4-
2012 dated September 11, 2012 provides the rules and regulations implementing 
Executive Order (EO) No. 431 dated May 30, 2005 directing the reversion of all 
unnecessary special and trust funds to the General Fund and for other purposes. 

 
72. Section 6 of the General Provisions of the GAA FY 2020 on Trust Receipts 

provides that “The following shall be deposited with the National Treasury and 
recorded as trust receipts in accordance with E.O. No. 338, s. 1996, as 
implemented by COA-DBM-DOF J.C. No. 1-97 dated January 2, 1997, and such 
other guidelines issued thereon: 

 

(a)  Receipts collected or received by departments, bureaus xxx (ii) as a 
guaranty for the fulfillment of an obligation; or (iii) from donations 
authorized by law or contract with a term not exceeding one (1) 
year; xxx 

 
The agency concerned shall submit its quarterly reports of all trust 
receipts collected or received, within thirty (30) days after the end of 
every quarter xxx” 

 

73. Also, Section 7 of the same law requires that “Performance bonds and deposits 
filed or posted by private persons or entities with departments, bureaus xxx shall be 
deposited with the National Treasury and recorded as trust receipts in accordance 
with E.O. No. 338, s. 1996, as implemented by COA-DBM-DOF J.C. No. 1-97 
dated January 2, 1997, and such other guidelines issued thereon.” 
 

74. Item No. II. B. of the Treasury Circular No. 01-2013 dated January 23, 2013 
provides the guidelines to the National Government Agency on the closure of 
dormant accounts. The procedures as stated on this Circular are as follows: 
 
a. The Head of Agency/Finance Head/Unit Head shall coordinate with BTr 

District/Provincial Office on the closure of the Dormant Account/s or 
Unauthorized Account/s. 

 
b. The Head of Agency/Finance Head/Unit Head shall issue a Letter of 

Instruction/Advice to the AGDB or other depository bank copy furnished the 
concerned BTr District/Provincial Office to close and transfer all balances of 
the Dormant Account/s or Unauthorized Account/s to the account of the TOP 
with the designated AGDB for further credit to the TOP RDDA with BSP. 

 
c. Within five (5) business days from closure of Dormant Account/s or 

Unauthorized Account/s, the Head of Agency/Finance Head/Unit Head shall 
submit a report to the Treasurer of the Philippines, copy furnished, Secretary, 



18 
 

Department of Budget and Management and the Chairperson, Commission 
on Audit. 

 
75. The EMB ROs I, II, III, IV-A, V, VI, XI, XII, XIII, and CAR have no dormant 

cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds and related 
accounts for reversion as of year-end, in conformity with Permanent Committee 
Joint Circular No. 4-2012, dated September 11, 2012, implementing EO No. 431, 
dated May 30, 2005. All fees, charges, assessments, and other receipts or revenues 
collected, trust receipts and performance bonds and deposits, among others, except 
as authorized by law to be retained by the agency for its use, were 
deposited/remitted to the National Treasury pursuant to Sections 4 to 14 of the 
General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA (Receipts and Income). 

 
76. However, the EMB CO and NCR did not deposit/remit to the BTr the trust receipts 

amounting to ₱9.407 million, shown as follows: 
 

EMB Office Amount 
(In million Pesos) 

Particulars 

CO 0.919 Bidding Documents 
0.129 Performance Bonds 
0.500 Financial Assistance from DENR-PRCMO DENR 

NCR 0.085 Bidding Documents 
0.274 Performance Bonds 
7.500 Fund transfers from DENR-CO 

Total 9.407  
 

77. The above cash were deposited to the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) under 
the PS Miscellaneous bank account of EMB CO without authority to maintain such 
depository account. For EMB NCR, collection from trust receipts were deposited in 
the Air Quality Management Fund (AQMF) bank account maintained with the 
LBP, although said collections/receipts were not among those included in Section 4 
of the DENR-DBM Joint Memorandum Circular No. 01 as the AQMF fund 
sources. 
 

78. The EMB CO and NCR explained that they were not aware that the above 
receipts/collections should have been remitted to the BTr and to be reported as 
Trust Receipts although this has been the practice ever since. But the annual GAA 
requires for the deposit of the trust receipts with the National Treasury and 
Treasury Circular No. 01-2013 was issued on January 23, 2013, which provides for 
the guidelines to the National Government Agency on the closure of 
dormant/unauthorized accounts. 
 

79. Thus, the provision under Sections 6 and 7 of the General provisions of the GAA 
FY 2020 as regards the deposits with BTr and recording of Trust Receipts was not 
complied with. 
 



19 
 

80. Further, the non-compliance with the remittance to the BTr may result to the non-
achievement of the country’s development objectives by having an efficient and 
sound utilization of government funds and revenues. 

 
81. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief, AFMD/FAD 

of: 
 

a. EMB CO and NCR to instruct the Cashiers to deposit all collections for 
trust receipts to the BTr, which shall be accounted for as Cash, 
Treasury/Agency Deposit-Trust pursuant to Section 6 and 7 of the GAA; 
and 
 

b. EMB CO to implement the immediate reversion and closure of the PS 
Miscellaneous account by depositing its entire amount with the BTr 
under the Cash, Treasury/Agency Deposit-Trust pursuant to Item No. II. 
B. of the Treasury Circular No. 01-2013 dated January 23, 2013. 
 

Non-liquidation of cash advances and insufficient Bond of Disbursing Officer 
 
82. Cash advances granted during the year for operating expenses, official local 

and foreign travels and special purpose/time-bound undertakings in ten EMB 
ROs amounting to ₱26.535 million were liquidated, except EMB CO and NCR 
amounting to ₱6.099 million or 76 percent of the cash advances granted 
during the year of ₱8.037 million were not liquidated at the end of the year. 
Also, in RO XI the unliquidated prior year balance of ₱0.005 million was 
already liquidated as of year-end. Moreover, the approved amount of fidelity 
bond of the accountable officer/Cashier in the amount of ₱0.500 million in 
EMB NCR was insufficient to cover her maximum accountability. 

 
83. The grant and liquidation of cash advances are governed by COA Circular No. 97-

002 date Feb. 10, 1997. Pertinent provisions are as follows: 
 

4.1. A cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as 
the purpose for which it was given has been served. 

 
Liquidation of cash advances: 

 
5.1.1  Salaries and wages, etc.- within five (5) days after each fifteen 

(15) day/end of the month pay period.  
5.1.2 Petty Operating Expenses and Field Operating Expenses- within 

twenty (20) days after the end of the year; subject to 
replenishment as frequently as necessary during the year.  

5.1.3 Official Travel- within sixty (60) days after return to the 
Philippines in the case of foreign travel or within thirty (30) days 
after return to permanent official station in the case of local 
travel, as provided for in EO 248 and COA Circular No. 96-004. 
 



20 
 

Failure of the AO to liquidate his cash advance within the prescribed 
period shall constitute a valid cause for the withholding of his salary as 
provided for under paragraphs 9.2 and 9.3 hereof. 
 

84. Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009 provides regulations 
governing the fidelity bonding of accountable public officers pursuant to the public 
bonding law, pertinent provisions, to wit: 

 
5.1  Amount of Bond – The amount of bond shall be based on the total 

accountability (cash, property and accountable forms) of the 
accountable public officer as determined by the Head of Agency. 
Provided, the individual maximum accountability of each 
accountable officer shall not exceed One Hundred Million Pesos 
(P100M). However, the Head of Agency may assign to other public 
officers the excess accountability for which a separate fidelity bond 
shall be secured. 

 
7.3 Increase in Accountability - Any increase in the amount of 

accountability, resulting to an increase in the amount of bond shall 
be subject to increase in premium. 

 
85. It is noteworthy to mention that cash advances granted during the year for operating 

expenses, official local and foreign travels and special purpose/time-bound 
undertakings in the following ten EMB ROs amounting to ₱26.535 million, were 
liquidated in accordance with COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. 
Also, in RO XI the unliquidated prior year balance of ₱0.005 million was already 
liquidated as of year-end.

87. According to the Chief Accountant of EMB CO, demand letters were not sent on 

due and demandable cash advances, particularly the prior years’ balance, due to 
non-identification of the accountable officers caused by the absence of subsidiary 
ledgers. 
 

88. While the AO/Cashier of EMB NCR explained that delays in the submission of the 
liquidation reports were due to series of isolation required due to possible exposure 
to COVID-19 positive individual and in December 2020, the Cashier herself got 
infected and was not able to report for almost a month. The negative balance of the 
prior years’ cash advance on special purpose/time-bound undertakings is “for 
reconciliation” since details are not known due to absence of subsidiary ledgers. 
 

89. The non-enforcement of settlement/liquidation of outstanding cash advances within 
the prescribed period, exposed government funds to the risk of possible loss, 
misuse and/or misapplication. 
 

90. Also, in EMB NCR, verification of the actual cash accountability of the Cashier 
during March and April 2020 showed that it has accumulated to ₱4.603 million, 
which is above her maximum cash accountability of ₱1.000 million under Risk No. 
DIIB-19-2921N effective December 20, 2019 to December 20, 2020, as shown on 
the next page.

91. This exceeded the maximum accountability for the approved amount of bond by 
₱3.603 million, which is not in accordance with the Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 
dated August 6, 2009. 
 

92. It should be noted that cash in the possession of the AO in excess of the maximum 
accountability is exposed to the possible risk of loss due to any unforeseen events. 
This may put the agency in a disadvantageous position since there is no possibility 
of recovering the said amount from the Fidelity Fund. Also, the AO will be 
subjected to a large sum of personal liability in case of loss and their application for 
relief from accountability is denied by the Commission on Audit. 
 

93. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. direct the Chief, AFMD/FAD of EMB CO and NCR to strictly enforce 
liquidation of outstanding cash advances within the prescribed period by 
sending demand letters to the officials and employees concerned and 
issuing order of payments, in case of failure to settle their cash advances 
when due for liquidation; 
 

b. require Chief Accountants of EMB CO and NCR to ensure that complete 
and updated subsidiary ledgers are maintained using the available 
documents/reports to record the details of transactions recorded in the 
GL; and 
 

c. direct the Chief, FAD of EMB NCR to strictly ensure that the cash 
handled by the accountable officer at any point in time does not exceed 
the maximum accountability for the approved amount of bond by 
applying for the increase of her fidelity bond to sufficiently cover the 
accountability. 

 
Non-liquidation of fund transfers to implementing agencies and NGOs/POs 
 
94. Fund transfers to implementing agencies and NGOs/POs of nine EMB ROs 

during the year for the implementation of agency’s projects amounting to 
₱21.993 million or 100 percent, of the funds transferred were not liquidated at 
year end. Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years 



23 
 

amounting to ₱721.739 million or 76 percent of prior year’s balance of 
₱952.423 million of EMB CO and 13 ROs. 
 

95. Section 5.4 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 31, 1994 provides that 
“The [Source Agency] SA shall require the IA to submit the reports and furnish the 
IA with a copy of the journal voucher taking up the expenditures.” While Section 
6.7 thereof requires the IA to return to the SA any unused balance upon completion 
of the project. 
 

96. Also, Section 5.3 of COA Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007 states that 
“The signing officials of the [Government Organization] GO to the MOA shall 
cause close monitoring and inspection of project implementation and verification of 
financial records and reports of the NGO/PO, and shall ensure compliance with the 
provisions of the MOA and of this Circular.” 
 

97. The fund transfers to implementing agencies (NGAs, Local Government Units 
(LGUs), Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) and Non-
Governmental Organizations/People’s Organizations (NGOs/POs) for the 
implementation of programs/projects of EMB Offices are shown as follows:

98. No liquidations were made for the fund transfers during the year of ₱21.993 

million. Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers of ₱721.739 million or 76 
percent of prior years’ balance of ₱952.423 million. However, it was noted that 
overall liquidation of fund transfers to LGUs has improved to 25 percent compared 
to last year’s liquidation of only 13 percent. 
 

99. Moreover, audit revealed the following observations in EMB CO and ROs as 
follows: 
 

EMB Office Causes/Conditions/Deficiencies 
CO, NCR  The Accounting Section, AFMD failed to send demand letters to the IAs 

and NGOs/POs due to heavy workload and the current pandemic situation. 
 Non-reconciliation of the EMB Accounting records with the implementing 

agencies (IAs) records resulting in discrepancy of ₱97.333 million. 
CAR, I, II  Failure/lapses of Management to monitor/enforce liquidation of fund 

transfers. 
III  Non-stipulation of program end-date and non-inclusion of penalty clause 

for breach of party’s obligations in the agreements between the EMB and 
the beneficiaries prolonged the implementation of the projects and rendered 
the idleness of the funds in the custody of the latter and the rescission or 
termination of the contract could not be done on time and the possible 
refund of the resources from the incompliant LGU could not be seasonably 
imposed for EMB’s reprogramming and rechanneling to other beneficiaries 
in priority. 

 Moreover, the agency was short of efforts to require the LGU-beneficiaries 
on the submission of financial/liquidation reports of completed and 
discontinued projects. 

 Reports of the EMB monitoring team on the status of the projects disclosed 
that some projects were already completed but the account remained 
unliquidated and the excess or unused funds were not refunded amounting 
to ₱7.695 million due to failure of the IAs to submit liquidation documents. 

IV-A  A significant decrease of ₱43.768 million from the unliquidated balance of 
₱71.655 million includes liquidations of non-moving accounts of ₱36.601 
million due to efforts made by Management in sending demand letters and 
follow-ups to LGUs with unliquidated financial assistance, in compliance 



25 
 

EMB Office Causes/Conditions/Deficiencies 
with the previous year’s audit recommendation. 

V, X, XII  Failure to compel LGUs to submit the Report of Checks Issued and/or 
Report of Disbursements as required under MOA between EMB and the 
LGUs. 

VI  Laxity of the Management in monitoring the fund transfer to DPWH which 
has already been three years and the renovation of the old PENRO building 
was now completed, yet the fund transfer was not fully liquidated; 

 Low liquidation rate of the prior years’ fund transfers to LGUs and delayed 
implementation of the projects due to inadequate monitoring controls of the 
agency such as Work and Financial Plans (WFPs). 

 The Solid Waste Management Section (SWMS) failed to coordinate with 
the LGUs for the revision of WFPs to suit the actual implementation of the 
projects upon approval of the requests for extension considering the late 
releases of the fund assistance to LGUs; hence, the LGUs were not able to 
submit the revised WFPs. 

VII  Long outstanding fund transfers to 19 cities/municipalities/barangays which 
remained unliquidated for more than one to four years; 

 Demand letters were sent to the concerned LGUs however, minimal 
compliance or liquidations were received from LGUs. 

X  MOA with LGU was not notarized, hence, unenforceable; 
 No exact duration or implementation timelines established for the projects; 
 Submitted liquidation documents to the SWMS but not forwarded to the 

Accounting Section for proper accounting. 
XI  Absence of an effective and efficient monitoring tool and evaluation system 

that provide at one glance, useful information on the status of the projects 
and in determining appropriate actions for projects that have actually been 
completed but remained unliquidated, and the ones which have remained 
unimplemented and are in need of technical assistance. 

XII  The delay of the implementation and liquidation of projects/programs was 
due to the enforcement of lockdown, community quarantines and some 
restrictions as preventive measures to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

XIII  Demand letters have been sent to the proper head of the IAs, copy 
furnished the Office of the Auditor; however, the concerned LGUs still 
failed to liquidate the same. 

 Environmental Monitoring and Enforcement Division (EMED) disclosed 
that for funds transferred from 2013 to 2018, there were 36 or 77 percent of 
the 47 projects that had already been completed, and for the funds 
transferred in 2019, only 9 or 20 percent out of the 46 projects were 
completed. 

 
100. Should the EMB concerned officials/employees have regularly sent demand letters 

to the IAs and strictly enforced their liquidation, the non-reconciliation of the 
reported balances in the books of accounts with the IAs and the accumulation of the 
unliquidated fund transfers may have been avoided. 

 
101. Thus, EMB Management is not compliant, in all material respects, with the 

provisions under Section 5.4 of the COA Circular No. 94-013 and Section 5.3 of 
COA Circular No. 2007-001 as regards the enforcement of liquidations/settlement 
of the fund transfers granted to IAs and the NGOs/POs. 

 



26 
 

102. The EMB RO I Management commented that it had sent letters to LGUs with 
overdue balance requesting for the liquidation, as a result additional 25 LGUs have 
submitted their liquidation amounting to ₱16.284 million, as of writing. 

 
103. In EMB RO XI in response to the Memorandum dated October 1, 2020 of Engr. 

Cunado, EMB Director the following activities were undertaken relative to the fund 
transfers, viz: 

 
 Since the in-house monitoring, evaluation and validation team created in 

2018 discontinued to function in 2019 because of staff reassignment, the 
validation was however, delegated to ESWMS monitoring staff and 
Environmental Monitoring Officers (ENMOs). 

 
 Sent follow ups or demand letters to LGUs to submit liquidation reports; 

 
 Monthly monitoring through ENMOs of non-functional Material Recovery 

Facility (MRF). 
 

 Verification of liquidation status as one of the criteria in the selection of 
LGUs to be provided with funding assistance in the future to ensure that they 
should not have any unliquidated balance from the previous funding 
assistance. 

 
104. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations with modification and 

Management agreed to instruct the: 
 

a. Chief, AFMD/FAD and Chief Accountants of: 
 
i. EMB CO and NCR to review and assess the functions and 

responsibilities of the personnel under their respective Accounting 
Sections to address the heavy work load; 

 
ii. EMB CO, NCR, CAR, I, II, V, VI, VII, X, and XII to send demand 

letter regularly to concerned IAs and NGOs/POs and to strengthen 
its monitoring controls in the liquidation of fund transfers to ensure 
timely submission of liquidation documents, that reconciliation with 
the IA’s records is facilitated and immediate refund of the 
unutilized fund for completed projects, if any; 

 
b. Chief, Solid Waste Management Division or designated monitoring team/ 

focal persons of EMB NCR, CAR, I, V, X, XI to closely monitor the 
progress of the projects and its conformance with the provisions 
indicated in the MOA, specifically on the target date of completion and 
require the LGUs to fast track completion of these projects so that the 
services/benefits that could be derived therefrom can be extended to the 



27 
 

targeted end-users and the funds transfers can be liquidated 
immediately; 

 
c. Ecological Solid Waste Management Section (ESWMS) of EMB RO III 

to: 
 
i. revisit the provisions of the MOA and consider the inclusion of 

implementation end-date and penalty clause that may impel or 
constrain the timely performance of the LGUs or the termination 
and cancellation of the agreement including the recovery of funds 
for reprogramming, if warranted; and 

 
ii. instruct the monitoring team to establish the existence of the 

projects funded from the fund transfers and to obtain the 
liquidation reports from LGUs with respect to completed projects 
and the return of excess and idle funds to BTr; 

 
d. FAD and SWMS of EMB RO VI to: 

 
i. coordinate with the LGUs on the revision of the WFP due to 

approved request for extension of project implementation; 
 
ii. prepare/execute amended MOA considering the time table which 

had already elapsed or nearing expiration; and 
 
iii. demand for the immediate refund of the financial assistance for 

those who have not yet implemented the project despite the grant of 
extension of the timetable, and which had already expired at the end 
of the year; 

 
e. Monitoring Team of EMB RO XI to submit an updated report on the 

status and results of the inspection and evaluation of the funded projects 
as of December 31, 2020 to the COA audit team; 

 
f. OIC - EMED of EMB RO XIII to make representation or hold dialogue 

with the concerned Local Chief Executives, Project Coordinators and 
their Accountants to identify problems in the non-liquidation of fund 
transfers; and 

 
g. Accountants of EMB CO, ROs NCR, CAR, I, II, III, IV-A, V, VI, VII, X, 

XI, XII and XIII , in case the concerned IAs still failed to comply with 
the settlement of unliquidated amount, to issue Final Letter of Demand 
to each IAs and furnish COA of the proof of service of said demand 
letter.

Non-liquidation of fund transfers to PS-DBM and PITC 
 
105. EMB ROs III, VI and XIII had no fund transfers to Procurement Service-

Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) and Philippine 
International Trade Center (PITC) for its common office supplies and 
equipment requirement during the year. However, EMB CO, ROs NCR, IV-A, 
VII and XI fund transfers to PS-DBM for its common-use supplies and airline 
tickets amounting to ₱9.425 million or 84 percent of the funds transferred 
during the year were not liquidated at year end. Also, no liquidations for prior 
year’s balance of fund transfers to PS-DBM and PITC amounting to ₱647.197 
million and ₱401.835 million, respectively. 

 
106. Item 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013 provides that it is the duty and responsibility 

of the IA to return to the SA any unused balance and refund of disallowance upon 
the completion of the project. 

 
107. EMB ROs III, VI and XIII had no fund transfers to PS-DBM and PITC for its 

common office supplies and equipment requirement during the year. There were 
also no unliquidated fund transfers in prior years. 

 
108. EMB CO, ROs NCR, IV-A, VII and XI have unliquidated balance of advances to 

PS-DBM and PITC for its common office supplies, airline tickets and equipment 
requirement totaling ₱1.058 billion or 94 percent of ₱1.131 billion advances during 
the current year and prior years, shown as follows:

109. In EMB CO, additional ₱2.000 million was transferred on December 4, 2020 to the 

PS-DBM for the common office supplies despite undelivered items and/or 
unliquidated prior years’ fund transfer. The CY fund transfer was still unliquidated 



29 
 

as of year-end. For the prior years’ unliquidated balance, the audit team sent 
confirmation letter to the PS-DBM and there was discrepancy of ₱454.654 million 
against the outstanding balance of ₱642.994 million, of which ₱443.338 million 
was said to have been returned to the BTr. However, only the e-copy of the 
Payment Voucher with check number 586733 dated October 26, 2018 was 
furnished to the audit team, without the copy of Official Receipt coming from the 
BTr as an evidence that the same was received by the latter although the AFMD 
constantly followed-up through emails and phone calls to the PS-DBM, the Official 
Receipt by the BTr was not yet submitted as to date. 

 
110. Also, no additional fund transfers to PITC during the year by EMB CO and the 

prior years’ unliquidated balance of ₱472.435 million was reduced by ₱70.600 
million on September 30, 2020 due to cancelled/staled check number 849641 dated 
December 13, 2019 without replacement issued because the allotment was already 
lapsed. It should be noted that the EMB CO and the PITC entered into a MOA on 
June 5, 2012 whereby the former appoints the latter as provider of Procurement 
Outsourcing Services and as a supplier of goods and services requirements. 

 
111. For EMB NCR, despite the outstanding balance of ₱4.203 million as of December 

31, 2019, it still transferred a total of ₱2.690 million in CY 2020 wherein only 
₱0.054 million were recorded as delivered/liquidated. Also, a difference of ₱4.334 
million was noted between the balances in the Statement of Account provided by 
the PS-DBM and the EMB NCR records as of December 31, 2020, which pertains 
to some deliveries not yet taken up as liquidation in the books of EMB NCR caused 
by non-submission of Delivery Receipts by the Procurement and Property 
Management Unit (PPMU) to the Accounting Section. 

 
112. EMB RO IV-A has fund transfers to PS-DBM for common office supplies 

amounted to ₱3.279 million, from which a total of ₱1.790 million were liquidated 
in accordance with COA Circular No. 94-013. The remaining amount of ₱1.489 
million were aged less than one year. There were no fund transfers made to PITC 
during the year. 

 
113. EMB ROs VII and XI Advances to PS-DBM in the amount of ₱2.800 million and 

₱0.500 million, respectively representing advance payments/initial deposits for 
Government Fares Agreement (GFA) which remained unliquidated as of December 
31, 2020. 

 
114. Further, no periodic reconciliation with the PS-DBM was conducted by EMB CO 

and NCR as well as EMB CO’s failure to send demand letter to PITC for prior 
year’s fund transfers, resulted in the accumulation of the outstanding advances. 

 
115. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. instruct the Chief, AFMD/FAD, Chief Accountant and Property/Supply 
Officers of EMB CO, NCR and IV-A to coordinate with PS-DBM to 



30 
 

reconcile the remaining difference between their respective books and 
demand for the delivery of undelivered goods, if not seek refund of said 
amount to the BTr; 

 
b. require the Supply Officer of EMB NCR to submit regularly to the 

Accounting Unit all the delivery receipts (DRs) and its supporting 
documents for the delivered supplies and materials in order to properly 
record in the books the deliveries of goods from PS-DBM in a timely 
manner; 

 
c. require the Accountants of EMB ROs VII and XI to coordinate with the 

PS-DBM as regard the unliquidated fund transfers/initial deposits on 
airline tickets thru the GFAs; and 

 
d. direct the Chief AFMD of EMB CO to send demand letter to PITC for 

the immediate liquidation of outstanding prior year’s fund transfers. 
 
Dormant accounts not requested for write-off 
 
116. Nine ROs have no dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, 

and fund transfers for write-off while in EMB XI, a request for write-off of 
dormant Other Receivables Account amounting ₱0.030 million was submitted 
to the Auditor’s Office in December 2020 for evaluation. On the other hand, 
dormant receivable accounts and unliquidated fund transfers amounting to 
₱4.951 million in EMB CO and RO I were not requested for write-off. 
 

117. COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 prescribes the guidelines 
and procedures on the write-off of dormant receivables and fund transfers of NGAs, 
LGUs and GOCCs. Pertinent provisions are as follows: 

 
“5.4. Dormant Receivable Accounts - accounts which balances 
remained inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for ten (1 0) 
years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be 
ascertained.” 
 
“5.6. Dormant Unliquidated Fund Transfers- advances granted by the 
source entity to implementing entity for the implementation of 
programs/projects which remained non-moving for ten (10) years or 
more and where settlement could no longer be ascertained.” 
 
“8.2. The Head of the government entity shall file the request for 
authority to write-off dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash 
advances, and fund transfers to the COA Audit Team Leader (ATL) 
and/or Supervising Auditor (SA).” 
 



31 
 

118. Nine EMB ROs (NCR, CAR, II, III, IV-A, V, VI, XII and XIII) have no dormant 
receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers for write-off 
while in EMB RO XI, a request for write-off of dormant Other Receivables 
Account amounting ₱0.030 million was submitted to the Auditor’s Office in 
December 2020 for evaluation, in accordance with Section 8.2 of COA Circular 
No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. 

 
119. However, EMB CO and RO I failed to file a request for write-off for dormant 

receivables and fund transfers amounting to ₱4.951 million despite the existence of 
accounts aging 10 years and more, as follows:

120. Considering the lapse of time that these accounts remained outstanding for 10 years 

and more, it indicates management’s inadequate monitoring of the settlement of the 
accounts. The collection of the above accounts is already remote, however, no 
request for write-off was filed by EMB CO and RO I. 

 
121. Thus, EMB CO and RO I are not compliant, in all material respects, with the 

provisions under Item 8.2 of the COA Circular No. 2016-005 as regards the filing 
of the request for authority to write-off dormant receivable accounts to COA. 

 
122. We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief, AFMD/FAD 

of EMB CO and RO I to prioritize the filing of a request for authority to 
write-off for dormant accounts that are deemed uncollectible, after all 



32 
 

remedies have been exhausted in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005 
dated December 19, 2016. 

 
Insurance of physical assets with GSIS 
 
123. EMB CO and nine ROs insured with the Government Service Insurance 

System (GSIS) property amounting to ₱1.232 billion with corresponding 
insurance premiums paid in the amount of ₱5.344 million. However, various 
PPE in ROs III, V, VII, X and XII amounting to ₱349.089 million were not 
insured, thus, the agency is at risk of not being indemnified in case of damage 
or loss of property. 

 
124. Section 5 of RA No. 656 or the Property Insurance Law states that: 

 
“Every government, except a municipal government below first class, is 
hereby required to insure its properties, with the Fund against any 
insurable risk herein provided and pay the premiums thereon, which, 
however, shall not exceed the premiums charged by private insurance 
companies: Provided, however, That the System reserves the right to 
disapprove the whole or a portion of the amount of insurance applied 
for: Provided, further, That such property or part thereof as may not be 
insurable or acceptable for insurance may be insured with any private 
insurance company. xxx” 

 
125. COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 provides the guidelines 

prescribing the submission of Property Inventory Form (PIF) not later than April 30 
of each year. 

 
126. For CY 2020, the EMB CO and ROs NCR, CAR, I, II, IV-A, VI, VIII, XI and XIII 

insured with the GSIS property amounting to ₱1.232 billion with corresponding 
insurance premium paid in the amount of ₱5.344 million, in accordance with RA 
No. 656, otherwise known as the “Property Insurance Law”, as amended by PD No. 
245 dated July 13, 1973. 

 
127. On the other hand, physical assets amounting to ₱349.089 million were not insured 

against fire or theft with the GSIS in EMB ROs III, V, VII, X and XII, shown as 
follows:

vehicles and scheduled with GSIS the 
insurance of said motor vehicles this 2021. 

- Management not fully aware that even 
those Technical and Scientific Equipment 
outside their office premises are still 
needed to be insured. 

Total 349.089   

 
128. The non-compliance with the requirement deprived the agency with the adequate and 

reliable protection against any damage to or loss of its property or assets and interests 
in case of fire, earthquake, storm or other fortuitous events/casualty. In a way, insuring 
government property helps mitigate the risk of probable losses to the government. It 
also deprived the GSIS of substantial premium income that should have formed part 
of its GIF. 

 
129. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Property Officers of 

EMB ROs III, VII, X and XII to insure all insurable physical assets and 



34 
 

properties with the GSIS to have an adequate and reliable protection against 
any damage to or loss of properties pursuant to RA No. 656. 

 
130. Also, we recommended and Management of RO V agreed to require the 

Supply/Property Officer to prepare and submit the Property Inventory Form 
as required under COA Circular No. 2018-002 in order to determine the 
accuracy of the insurance coverage of the EMB Region V properties. 

 
Non-disposal of unserviceable property 
 
131. EMB RO II has no unserviceable property as of year-end while EMB ROs I, 

III, VI, and XI have disposed of their unserviceable properties, in compliance 
with Section 79 of PD No. 1445. While unserviceable property with a total cost 
of ₱38.864 million in EMB CO, ROs NCR, VII and XIII and undetermined 
amount in RO V remained not disposed of, thus, exposing them to further 
deterioration and decreasing their realizable value. 

 
132. Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides that, “when government property has become 

unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of 
the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly 
authorized representative x x x and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be 
destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction 
to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or 
similar body x x x . In the event that the public auction fails, the property may be

133. Section 40.d. Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that “All 

unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of 
Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74). x x x” 

 
134. EMB RO II has no unserviceable property as of year-end while EMB ROs I, III, 

VI, and XI have disposed of their unserviceable properties, in compliance with 
Section 79 of PD No. 1445. 

 
135. However, there are property amounting to ₱38.864 million found to be 

unserviceable but were not disposed of by EMB CO, ROs NCR, VII and XIII, 
which is not in compliance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445, shown as follows:

exposes these pieces of property to further deterioration 
and decreases its realizable value. The Acting 
Supply/Property Officer did not prepare the IIRUP for 
submission to the Disposal Committee hence, the 
amount of undisposed property cannot be determined 
and also the reason for the non-disposal of the subject 
property. 

VII 10.192 No reason mentioned 

XIII 3.763 

Tedious process in the identification and classification of 
these properties as hazardous and non-hazardous through 
the conduct of physical count on the last quarter of CY 
2020. Also, the agency had conducted and reported on 
the physical count of equipment for CY 2019, yet this 
was not used as reference in the preparation of IIRUP in 
the disposal of unserviceable property in CY 2020. 
Hence, there was laxity in the implementation of the 
audit recommendations, which resulted in recurrence of 
the same deficiency. 

Total 38.864  

 
136. While the above-cited reason for the non-disposal of the unserviceable equipment is 

acceptable given the current pandemic situation, however, it is incumbent upon the 
Management to address the existing conditions and manage the existing and 
emerging risks. 

 
137. The non-disposal of unserviceable property is contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 

1445, which exposes the property to further deterioration and deprives the 
government of possible additional income from sale thereof, if warranted. Further, 
the recurring failure of the officials/employees responsible to comply the said 
regulations may subject to disciplinary action. 

 
138. We recommended and Management agreed to order the Property Officers and 

Disposal Committee of EMB CO, NCR, V, VII and XIII to institute the 
necessary measures to properly dispose all the obsolete and unserviceable 
properties pursuant to Section 79 of PD No. 1445; and Property Officers of 
EMB NCR and V to list down all obsolete and unserviceable PPE with 
complete data in the IIRUP and submit to the Disposal Committee for proper 
disposition, in accordance with Section 40.d. Chapter 10, Volume I of the 
GAM for NGAs. 

 
Procurement of goods, consultancy services and infrastructure projects 
 
139. This year’s procurement of goods and consultancy services, through negotiated 

procurement (emergency purchase), amounting to ₱15.103 million, and ₱23.334 
million, respectively, in EMB CO, ROs CAR, II, III and VI were in accordance 
with Section 53.2 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and                



36 
 

Regulation (IRR) of RA No. 9184 (Procurement Law) while there was no 
procurement of infrastructure projects. Also, EMB NCR and IV have no 
procurement of goods, consultancy services and infrastructure projects, through 
negotiated procurement (emergency purchase) for CY 2020. 

 
Delayed/Non- submission of government contracts 
 
140. Copies of 1,158 government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting 

documents amounting to ₱107.902 million of EMB ROs CAR, I, II, IV-A, VI 
and XI were submitted within the prescribed period and the same were 
verified to be complete and in order. While copies of 601 government 
contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents of EMB CO, ROs 
NCR, III, V, X and XIII with corresponding amount of ₱397.756 million were 
not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from one to 
218 days. 

 
141. Items 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 

requires submission of contracts and Purchase Orders (POs) entered into by any 
government agency irrespective of amount involved and each of all the documents 
forming part thereof by reference or incorporation within five (5) working days 
from execution of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or 
incorporation. 

 
142. Also, COA Circular No. 96-010 dated August 15, 1996 provides the guidelines in 

the preparation and submission of Purchase Orders relative to the procurement of 
supplies and equipment. Item B of the Circular listed the basic data which should 
invariably appear in the PO or other contract used by the government agencies 
which includes the Purchase Order No., date of PO, date of delivery, terms, among 
others. 

 
143. In EMB ROs CAR, I, II, IV-A, VI and XI, copy of government contracts, purchase 

orders and their supporting documents totaling 1,158 and amounting to      
₱107.902 million were submitted within the prescribed period, in accordance with 
Items 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 and 
the same were verified to be complete and in order. 

 
144. On the other hand, in EMB CO and ROs NCR, III, V and XIII, copy of 198 

approved contract/agreements with corresponding amount of ₱51.236 million were 
not submitted for review to the Audit Teams within five working days from the 
execution of the contract with delays ranging from 1 to 218 days, contrary to Item 
3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 while 202 POs amounting to ₱27.054 million 
were submitted late with delays ranging from 1 to 218 days, contrary to item 3.2.1

totaling 201 with corresponding amount of ₱5.226 million, ₱14.134 million, and 
₱300.106 million in ROs NCR, III and X, respectively were not submitted. 
 

146. Other deficiencies were also noted as follows: 
 

EMB Office Deficiencies Noted  
CO - Property and General Services Section (PGSS) concerned personnel 

overlooked the submission of the POs/contracts due to voluminous 
documents and at the same time functioned as the receiving/releasing clerk. 
 

- Not pre-numbered contracts entered by and between the EMB-CO and 
suppliers/consultants. 

NCR - Heavy workloads of the Property and Procurement Management Unit 
(PPMU) staff, limited physical presence in the office due to alternative 
work arrangement and strict quarantine protocols and several office 
lockdowns brought about by the COVID-19; POs still waiting for delivery, 
which was in contravention to the provisions of the COA Circular No. 
2009-01, which requires the submission within five days upon perfection of 
the contract and not upon delivery of the procured goods. 

III - Property and General Services Unit (PGSU) concerned employees 
overlooked to submit the copy to COA Office due to some intervening 
reports and workloads. They also explained that the lack of signatures of 
employees/personnel in some documents contributed to the delay in 
submission. 

V - Date of receipt by the dealers were not indicated in 3 POs amounting to 
₱0.820 million. 

X - The BAC failed to submit the contract with complete supporting documents 
for the procurement for the Design and Build of Sanitary Landfill Facility of 
Marawi City as Part of Marawi Recovery with an Approved Budget for the 
Contract in the amount of ₱300.106 million. 



38 
 

EMB Office Deficiencies Noted  
- Lacking supporting documents for the Design and Build for the Preparation 

of Detailed Engineering Design and Construction for the Proposed Central 
Materials Recovery Facility of Marawi City at Brgy. Malimono, Marawi 
City (PR No. 119-2020) in the amount of ₱32.500 million. 

XIII - Based on the AAPSI as of December 31, 2020 submitted by the Agency for 
the 2019 ML, it indicated that General Services Section (GSS) were 
submitting POs within the prescribed period with transmittal letter and 
ensuring that approved contracts/POs were properly and completely filled 
up; however, the Management’s action taken could not be relied upon since 
the same deficiency were observed for CY 2020. There was delayed 
submission for the reason that there was confusion between the BAC 
Secretariat and General Service, Property and Supply Unit as to who will 
forward the perfected contracts and its supporting documents. 

 
- 187 POs with total amount of ₱12.582 million were not properly 

accomplished with the required data such as the date conformed by the 
suppliers. 

 
147. The non-submission of the perfected contracts/POs with the supporting documents 

to the Office of the Auditor within the reglementary period and the lack of 
necessary data in the purchase orders are contrary to Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of 
COA Circular No. 2009-001, which precluded the Audit Teams from the prompt 
and effective conduct of auditorial review and technical evaluation of the contracts, 
and penalties in case of non-delivery of goods/services could not be imposed. 

 
148. Moreover, the practice of not pre-numbering the copy of contracts entered by the 

EMB CO with suppliers/consultants is an indication of the lack of the Agency’s 
monitoring mechanism in ensuring that all contracts are accounted for and the 
progress of the procurement are monitored taking into consideration the 
timelines/lead time in each stage of the procurement process. 

 
149. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the: 
 

a. HRMDS of EMB CO and NCR to assess/evaluate the duties and 
responsibilities of the staff concerned in order to ensure equitable 
distribution of workload, which includes the submission of copies of 
POs/contracts by the PGSS/PPMU/BAC Secretariat, and to remind them 
to efficiently perform their assigned duties and responsibilities; 
 

b. PGSS/Procurement Unit/BAC Secretariat of EMB CO, NCR, III, V, X 
and XIII to strictly comply with the submission of the authenticated 
copies of contracts/POs and all their pertinent documents to the Office of 
the Auditor pursuant to COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 
2009; 
 

c. Property Officer of EMB CO to pre-number or create a monitoring 
system for all the contracts entered into by the EMB CO to ensure full 
accounting/monitoring; and 



39 
 

d. Procurement Unit/Supply Officer of ROs V and XIII to indicate the 
dates in all perfected contracts/POs as required for reckoning of the 
effectivity of the contracts/POs and for purposes of liquidated damages 
in compliance with procurement laws, rules and regulations. 
 

Withholding and remittance of GSIS contributions, loans and employer’s share 
 
150. The 13 EMB Regional Offices’ GSIS personal shares and loan amortizations 

of employees amounting to ₱42.477 million and ₱23.581 million, respectively, 
were deducted properly and remitted without delay. Likewise, the employer’s 
share amounting to ₱14.977 million was remitted without delay. However, 
EMB CO and NCR did not fully remit the GSIS personal shares and loan 
amortizations of employees amounting to ₱0.802 million and RO VII had over-
remitted balance of ₱0.004 million during CY 2020. 

 
151. The IRR of RA No. 8291 or the Government Service Insurance Act of 1997 

provides the following provisions: 
 

Section Provision 

13.1 
It shall be compulsory upon the government agency to deduct from the fixed monthly 
compensation the personal share of the members and to promptly remit the same to 
GSIS. 

14.1 
Each government agency shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and 
government agency’s contributions within the first Ten (10) days of the calendar month 
following the month to which the contributions apply. 

14.2 

The government agency shall also deduct from the fixed monthly compensation of the 
employee the loan amortizations (consolidated loans, policy loan, emergency loan, 
housing loan, and other loans), premium payments (optional, pre-need and other non-
life insurance) and other amounts due the GSIS. 

14.3 
The said amounts shall be remitted to the GSIS within the first Ten (10) days of the 
calendar month following the month when the deductions were effected, accompanied 
by supporting lists in the form prescribed by the GSIS.” 

 
152. For CY 2020, EMB CO and 15 ROs withheld GSIS employees’ contributions and 

loans amounting to ₱60.128 million and ₱34.076 million, respectively, and 
remitted/refunded ₱113.659 million including employer’s shares amounting to 
₱20.253 million, shown as follows:

*Includes refund to employees of ₱2.048 million due to Moratorium 

 
153. EMB CAR and ROs I, II, III, IV-A, IV-B, V, VI, VIII, X, XI, XII and XIII properly 

withheld and remitted the GSIS employees’ shares and loans without delay as well 
as the employer’s share amounting to ₱42.477 million, ₱23.581 million, ₱14.977 
million, respectively. 

 
154. However, EMB CO withheld a total of ₱13.158 million from its employees for the 

payment of employees’ contributions and loan amortizations but only able to remit 
to GSIS and refund to employees amounting to ₱10.526 million and ₱2.048 
million, respectively, or a total of ₱12.574 million, thus, resulting to unremitted 
balance of ₱0.584 million as of the conduct of the audit. Also, prior years’ withheld 
premium contributions and loans amounting to ₱0.369 million remained unremitted 
as of year-end. 

 
155. Likewise, EMB NCR failed to comply with the monthly remittances, which is 

within the 10th day of the month following the period covered. Delays ranging 
from three to 52 days for the remittances totaling ₱2.581 million of premiums and 
loans withheld for the months of January, April, May and July 2020 as well as the 
government share of ₱0.511 million due to the delayed updating of the Agency 
Remittance Advice (ARA) by the Agency’s Administrative Officer (AAO) due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic situation wherein series of quarantine measures were 
implemented in the office due to possible exposure to COVID-19 positive 
individual. It has unremitted balance as of the conduct of the audit amounting to 
₱0.218 million for the CY 2020 and prior years’ withheld premium contributions 
and loans amounting to ₱0.298 million. 

 
156. As a result, interest and charges were imposed by the GSIS to EMB NCR but were 

personally paid by the personnel-in-charge, who caused delays in remittances. 
 
157. While RO VII reported an over-remittance of ₱0.004 million for loan amortizations 

during the year and unremitted prior years’ balance of ₱0.348 million. 



41 
 

158. The non and/or over-remittance was due to non-reconciliation of the monthly 
deductions in the payroll and the corresponding remittances per ARA and the 
absence of subsidiary ledgers maintained to record the payroll deductions and 
remittances for each personnel account for both premium contributions and loan 
amortizations. 

 
159. In addition, delays in remittances of loan amortization may result in suspension of 

all loan privileges of all the members of the affected agencies and they shall be 
disqualified to receive the yearly dividends as stated in Section 16.1 of the GSIS 
Act of 1997. 

 
160. Should the EMB concerned officials/employees have regularly conducted the 

reconciliation of the withheld and remitted GSIS contributions and loans, the 
unremitted balances may have been avoided. 

 
161. Thus, the Bureau is not compliant, in all material respects, with the provisions in 

Republic Act (RA) No. 8291 as regards the withholding and remittances of GSIS 
insurance premiums and loan amortizations. 

 
162. Further, the non-remittance of the withheld contributions and loans deprives the 

GSIS of resources to invest and fund the retirement claims and other benefits of its 
members. 

 
163. We recommended and Management agreed to instruct/require the: 

 
a. Administrative Officer of EMB NCR to observe the timelines in the 

remittance of the GSIS employees’ premium contributions and loan 
amortizations as well as the government share so that regular updating 
of the Agency Remittance Advice be made prior to the due date of 
remittance to prevent delays in remittances; and 

 
b. Chief, AFMD/FAD of EMB CO, NCR and RO VII to review and assess 

the functions and responsibilities of the personnel at the Accounting 
Section for equitable distribution of workload to ensure the full 
remittance of GSIS personal contributions and loans in accordance with 
the provisions of R.A. No. 8291 and its IRR. 

 
Withholding and remittance of PhilHealth contributions and employer’s share 
 
164. The 12 EMB ROs withheld PhilHealth personal contributions amounting to 

₱6.683 million and government share amounting to ₱6.639 million were 
remitted to PhilHealth within the prescribed deadline while EMB CO, NCR, 
ROs VII and VIII did not fully remit withheld PhilHealth personal 
contributions and government share amounting to ₱3.542 million and ₱2.831 
million, respectively. 

 



42 
 

165. Section 18 (b) of the National Health Insurance Act of 2013 (R.A No. 7875 as 
Amended by R.A No. 9241 and 10606) provides that “The monthly premium 
contribution of employed members shall be remitted by the employer on or before 
the date prescribed by the Corporation.” 

 
166. Pursuant to the above said provision the PhilHealth issued Circular No. 0001 series 

of 2014 for the revised payment schedule as follows: 
 

Employers with PENs ending in 0-4 Every 11th-15th day of the month following the 
applicable period 

Employers with PENs ending in 5-9 Every 16th-20th day of the month following the applicable 
period 

 
167. For CY 2020, EMB CO and 15 ROs withheld and remitted PhilHealth contributions 

amounting to ₱10.225 million and ₱10.183 million, respectively, leaving a balance 
of ₱0.042 million. Also, the withheld and remitted government share amounted to 
₱9.470 million, shown as follows:

168. The EMB CAR and ROs I, II, III, IV-A, IV-B, V, VI, X, XI, XII and XIII withheld 

and remitted intact and without delay the PhilHealth members’ contributions and 
government share amounting to ₱6.683 million and ₱6.639 million, respectively. 

 
169. In EMB NCR and RO VIII, remittances of PhilHealth contributions amounting to 

₱0.538 million were late which registered delay by 7 to 38 days therefore not in 
accordance with the PhilHealth Regulations, as shown on the next page.

170. EMB NCR PhilHealth Employer Number (PEN) is 140374100079, which indicates 

that remittances should be every 16th -20th day of the month following the 
applicable period, however, the agency did not fully comply with the monthly 
remittance for premiums withheld from the regular payroll during January, April 
and May 2020 and individual disbursement vouchers as well as the corresponding 
government share while RO VIII did not remit within the 11th to 15th day 
following the applicable period for the months of April and May 2020. 

 
171. The delay was due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation wherein quarantine 

measures were implemented as well as the alternative working arrangement 
adopted by the agency. However, this cannot be considered valid as timely 
remittance of obligations was noted for dues to some private entities such as loans 
and savings association, cooperative and other private lending institutions during 
April and May 2020. 

 
172. Moreover, EMB CO and NCR were not able to remit intact the withheld PhilHealth 

contributions amounting to ₱1.087 million and ₱0.594 million as there were 
under/over-remittances during the period covered from January to December 2020 
for EMB CO and January to March, May, July to December 2020 for EMB NCR. 
While RO VII is yet to trace/adjust the remaining unreconciled balances during the 
year of ₱0.035 million. Prior years’ balance amounting to ₱0.335 million remained 
unremitted as of year-end of the EMB CO, NCR and RO VII. 

 
173. Non-maintenance of subsidiary ledgers to record the payroll deductions and 

remittances for each personnel account for premium contributions were the main 
causes of the said over/under-remittances. Should the EMB CO, NCR and RO VII 
concerned officials/employees have maintained complete and updated Subsidiary 
Ledgers and regularly conducted the reconciliation of the withheld and remitted 
PhilHealth contributions, the unremitted balances may have been monitored and 
accumulation be avoided. 

 
174. Interview with the concerned Accounting staff of EMB NCR also revealed that the 

change of duties and responsibilities due to the retirement of the former Chief, 
Finance Section causes the said under-remittances. 

 
175. Thus, the Bureau is not compliant, in all material respects, with the provisions of 

R.A No. 7875 as Amended by R.A No. 9241 and 10606 as regards the withholding 
and remittances of the PhilHealth monthly premium contribution of employed 
members.

176. Further, the non-remittance of contributions and premiums in a timely manner 
deprives the PhilHealth of resources to invest and fund the claims of its members. 

 
177. The Management commented that the EMB NCR FAD started formulating its 

succession plan, however, there is only one Accountant position in the Regional 
Office, which hinders it to develop its succession plan for said position. 

 
178. We recommended and Management agreed to instruct/require the: 
 

a. Accountants of EMB NCR and RO VIII to prioritize and strictly comply 
with the timelines in the remittance of the PhilHealth employees’ 
premium contributions as well as the government share to avoid 
forfeiture of claims/benefits due to member/employees; and 

 
b. Chief, AFMD/FAD of EMB CO, NCR and RO VII to assign personnel to 

maintain complete and updated subsidiary ledgers with their close 
supervision to ensure the full remittance of PhilHealth contributions in 
accordance with the provisions of R.A. No. 7875 as Amended by R.A No. 
9241; and EMB NCR to consider succession planning to address the 
retirement issues or movement of personnel in order not to hamper the 
operations of the Agency. 

 
Withholding and remittance of Pag-IBIG contributions, loans and employer’s share 
 
179. The 14 Regional Offices withheld and remitted intact the Pag-IBIG 

contributions and government share amounting to ₱14.325 million, except for 
Pag-IBIG personal share and loans of employees and employer’s share 
amounting to ₱3.781 million and ₱0.276 million of EMB CO and NCR, 
respectively, with delays ranging from three to 310 days. 

 
180. Rule VII of the IRR of the Pag-IBIG Fund Law discusses the collection and 

remittance of the Pag-IBIG contributions and loan amortizations. Pertinent 
provision on the remittance of collections is as follows: 

 
Section 3. Remittance of Collections. 

 
a. All employers shall remit to the Fund their contributions and the 

contributions of their covered employees as well as the latter’s loan 
amortizations or payments to the Fund, as provided for under Section 
2 of this Rule, when applicable, within fifteen (15) days from the date 
the same were collected unless another period is previously agreed 
upon between the employer and the Fund, or within such periods as 
the Fund may prescribe otherwise. xxx 

 
181. Further, Item 4 (E), Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) Circular No. 275 

dated January 22, 2010 provides that “Employers shall remit the required monthly 



45 
 

employer and employee contributions to the nearest Pag-IBIG branch or its 
authorized collecting banks, together with the duly accomplished Membership 
Contribution Remittance Form (MCRF), in accordance with the following 
remittance schedule: 

 
First Letter of  Due date employer’s name 
A to D  10th to the 14th day of the month following the 

period covered 
E to L  15th to the 19th day of the month following the 

period covered 
M to Q  20th to the 24th day of the month following the 

period covered 
R to Z, Numeral  25th to the end of the month following the 

period covered 
 
Failure or refusal of the employer to pay or to remit the contributions 
herein prescribed shall not prejudice the right of the covered member to 
the benefits under the Fund. Such employer shall be charged a penalty 
equivalent to 1/10 of 1% per day of delay of the amount due starting on 
the first day immediately following the due date until the date of full 
settlement.” 

 
182. For CY 2020, EMB CO and 15 ROs withheld and remitted/refunded Pag-IBIG 

employees’ contributions and loans amounting to ₱18.382 million and ₱17.722 
million, respectively, including government share of ₱1.540 million, shown as

183. In EMB CO and NCR, the remittances for the period January to December 2020 

with a total amount withheld of ₱3.781 million and employer’s share of ₱0.276 
million were delayed ranging from three to 212 days and 24 to 310 days, 
respectively. The delay was due to the reconciliation of various information of 
member-employees contained in the Remittance Schedule with that of Pag-IBIG 
records, such as the Pag-IBIG ID and employee’s name, which needs to be 
reconciled/matched. 

 
184. Although the Pag-IBIG had granted the Agency to work on the reconciliation of the 

data of the employees, the delay may affect the timely processing of the employees’ 
claims and possible forfeiture of benefits. 

 
185. Nonetheless, the Bureau is still not compliant, in all material respects, with the 

provisions of RA 9679, Pag-IBIG Fund Law as regards the proper withholding, and 
complete and timely remittances of Pag-IBIG premium and Loan amortizations 
withheld to the Pag-IBIG Fund. 

 
186. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountants of 

EMB CO and NCR to strictly ensure the timely remittance of the monthly 
contributions/loan amortizations withheld from the employees as well as the 
employer’s share in accordance with the provisions of RA 9679 to avoid penal 
sanctions under HDMF Circular No. 275 thereof. 

 
Withholding and remittance of taxes 
 
187. The taxes from gross compensation income of officials and employees and 

suppliers/contractors on government purchases and contract of services 
amounting to ₱46.981 million and ₱23.339 million, respectively, in 12 EMB 
Regions were properly withheld and remitted without delay, except for taxes 
withheld by EMB CO and three Regions that were not remitted intact, with 
delays ranging from 29 to 153 days, leaving a balance of ₱0.884 million. 

 
188. Section 5 of Revenue Regulations No. 11-2018 dated January 31, 2018, Section 

2.58 of RR No. 2-98, as amended provides that “Considering that taxes withheld by 
the withholding agents are held in trust for the government and its availability is an 
imperious necessity to ensure sufficient cash inflow to the National Treasury, 
withholding agents shall file BIR Monthly Remittance Form (BIR Form No. 0619E 



47 
 

and/or 0619F) every tenth (10th) day of the following month when the withholding 
is made, regardless of the amount withheld.” 

 
189. Also, Section 11 of Revenue Regulations No. 11-2018 dated January 31, 2018, 

Section 2.80 of RR No. 2-98, as amended states that “If the withholding agent is 
the government…, the employee thereof responsible for the withholding and 
remittance of tax shall be personally liable for the surcharge and interest imposed 
herein.” 

 
190. Section 32 of the NIRC defines gross income as all income derived from whatever 

source, which include among others 13th month pay and other benefits in excess of 
the allowable statutory amount of ₱90,000.00. 

 
191. In Item 28 of BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 50-2018 dated May 

11, 2018, BIR clarified that an individual under a Contract of Service (COS) and 
Job Order (JO) arrangement is considered self-employed. The term self-employed 
in relation to a professional is defined in Section 2(n) of BIR Revenue Regulations 
No. 8-2018 dated January 25, 2018, to wit: 

 
Self-employed – a sole proprietor or an individual contractor who 
reports income earned from self-employment. S/he controls who s/he 
works for, how the work is done and when it is done. It includes those 
hired under contract of service or job orders, and professionals whose 
income is derived purely form the practice of profession and not under 
an employer-employee relationship. 

 
192. Item No. 10 of letter A of RMC No. 51-2018 dated June 8, 2018 states that: 
 

A. Professionals and Other Supplier of Services Hired under a Contract 
for Service or Job Order deriving gross receipt of ₱250,000.00 and 
below in any 12-months from a Lone Payor and with no other source of 
income. 

 
10. Filing and payment of Percentage Tax using Quarterly Percentage 
Tax Return (BIR Form No. 2551Q) 

 
a. If opted to avail of the Graduated Income Tax Rates under Section 
24(A)(2)(a) of the Tax Code, as amended – Subject to withholding of 
three percent (3%) percentage tax under Section 5.116(A)(1) of Revenue 
Regulations (RR) No. 2-98, as amended. 

 
b. Exempted from filing and payment of percentage tax and/or 
withholding of percentage tax if qualified and opted to avail of the 8% 
income tax rate and submits an Income Payee’s Sworn Declaration of 
his/her gross receipts/sales (Annex “A1”) to the income 
payor/withholding agent, together with a copy of duly received BIR 



48 
 

Form No. 1901 or copy of BIR Form No. 0605 – Annual Registration 
Fee payment, in lieu of the COR (not required to attach COR) 

 
193. RMC No. 5-2006 dated November 2, 2005 prescribes to all government 

withholding agents a Government Money Payment Chart for the computation of 
taxes withheld at sources on the sale of goods and services to the government or 
any of its political subdivisions including barangays, instrumentalities or agencies, 
and government owned or controlled corporations (GOCCs) whether subject to 
Creditable Withholding Tax, Final VAT and Percentage Tax. 

 
194. Likewise, RMC No. 23-2007 dated March 30, 2007 provides clarification on the 

aforementioned circular and gives clear examples on the proper computation of the 
five percent (5%) withholding of VAT, three percent (3%) withholding of 
percentage tax and the additional withholding of income tax of one percent (1%) 
and two percent (2%) on goods and services, respectively. 

 
195. For CY 2020, the EMB Offices withheld and remitted taxes from gross 

compensation income and suppliers/contractors/contract of services amounting to 
₱113.324 million and ₱112.440 million, respectively. Details are as shown as

196. Deficiencies were noted on the following EMB Offices: 
 
EMB 
Office 

Deficiencies 

CO - The total amount withheld for the month does not tally with the corresponding 
remittance or there were under-remittances by ₱0.649 million for the taxes on 
gross compensation income from officials and employees and over-remittances of 
₱(0.437) million, and ₱(0.147) million for taxes from suppliers/contractors on 
government purchases of goods, consultancy services and infrastructure projects 
and prior years’ withheld, respectively. 
 

- Withholding taxes under the Air Quality Management Fund (AQMF) or Fund 
Cluster 3 amounting to ₱0.042 million was not remitted with the BIR for prior 
years’ withheld taxes, which resulted in the accumulation of unremitted balance 
by ₱0.064 million. 

NCR - Failed to comply with the monthly remittance within the 10th day of the month 
following the period covered. Delays ranging from 29 to 153 days were noted for 
the remittances totaling ₱0.325 million for taxes withheld from February to 
August 2020, comprised of taxes on gross compensation income from officials 
and employees and government procurement of goods, consultancy services and 
infrastructure projects from suppliers/ contractors totaling ₱0.062 million and 
₱0.263 million, respectively due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation wherein 
series of quarantine measures were implemented in the office due to possible 
exposure to COVID-19 positive individual. 
 

- The total amount withheld for the month does not tally with the corresponding 
remittance or over-remittance of ₱0.010 million for the taxes on gross 
compensation income from officials and employees while under-remittance of 
₱0.005 million for taxes from suppliers/contractors on government purchases of 
goods, consultancy services and infrastructure projects. While the prior years’ 
withheld were still under remitted totaling ₱0.472 million, composed of the 
Regular Fund amounting to ₱0.205 million, ₱0.099 million for AQMF (Fund 
Cluster 3) and ₱0.168 million for Environment Revolving Fund (Fund Cluster 6). 
Hence, resulted in the accumulation of unremitted balance of ₱0.467 million. 
 

- Overpayment in taxes withheld from suppliers/contractors on government 
purchases of goods, consultancy services and infrastructure projects amounting to 
₱0.020 million were noted for the remittances made on February 10, 2020 
wherein same supplier name were listed but the other name does not have TIN. 

CAR - Computed gross income of officers and employees does not include the benefits 
received such as Service Recognition Incentive (SRI), Loyalty Pay and Hazard 
Pay amounting to ₱0.920 million resulting in the understatement of the taxes 
withheld and remitted by ₱0.141 million. 

IV-B - Taxes withheld on income payments to individuals hired under Contract of 
Service or Job Order arrangement were not in accordance with BIR Revenue 
Memorandum Circular No. 51-2018 dated June 8, 2018 resulting in tax deficiency 
of ₱0.046 million to some employees and over withholding of ₱0.110 million to 
other employees. 

VII - The agency is yet to trace/adjust the remaining unreconciled balances of ₱0.150 
million due to lack of subsidiary ledgers. 

X - The balance of ₱0.527 million is for reconciliation by the Accounting Section. 
XIII - Nine (9) payments for catering services and security services in the total amount 

of ₱0.190 million, wherein the applicable withholding of income tax of two 
percent was not deducted or erroneously deducted as prescribed under RMC No. 
5-2006, and as clarified under RMC No. 23-2007, thus, resulted to under 



50 
 

EMB 
Office 

Deficiencies 

deduction of the said withholding taxes in the total amount of ₱0.003 million due 
to breakdown of controls in the review of the disbursement vouchers particularly 
on the withholding of taxes. 

 
197. The incomplete remittances in EMB CO and NCR was due to absence of subsidiary 

ledgers, which resulted in a weak monitoring of the amount to be remitted against 
the taxes withheld and no regular reconciliations were conducted by the Accounting 
personnel due to absence of complete records; thus, resulted to the accumulation of 
unremitted balances. 

 
198. The delay in the remittances of taxes withheld in EMB NCR was due to COVID-19 

pandemic situation wherein series of quarantine measures were implemented in the 
office due to possible exposure to COVID-19 positive individual. 

 
199. Thus, the Bureau is not compliant, in all material respects, with the provisions of 

the NIRC and its IRR as regards the monthly withholding and remittances of taxes 
withheld. 

 
200. Moreover, the non-remittance of the withheld taxes would result to the imposition 

of penalties and surcharges pursuant to Section 11 of the RR 11-2018. 
 
201. We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountants: 
 

a. EMB CO, ROs NCR, VII and X, to exert effort to maintain updated 
subsidiary ledgers as basis in the conduct of monthly analysis and 
reconciliation of withholding taxes against the remittances and ensure 
that withheld taxes on compensation and procurement of goods and 
services are remitted intact to the BIR or its authorized government 
servicing bank within the prescribed period to avoid incurrence of 
unnecessary expenses in the form of interest and surcharges; 

 
b. EMB NCR, to request the BIR for the offsetting of the overpaid amount 

of ₱0.020 million, otherwise, require the person responsible to refund the 
same; 

 
c. EMB CAR, to require the concerned officers and employees pay the tax 

deficiency and remit to the BIR; and the payroll master consider all 
income received by the officers and employees in the computation of 
their taxes; 

 
d. RO IV-B, to recover the tax deficiency in the amount of ₱0.046 million to 

cover the full tax obligations of the COS and JO personnel for the year 
2020. Failure to recover such, employee responsible for withholding of 
taxes will be personally liable for failure to deduct and withhold any 
revenue tax under any withholding tax laws and regulations; and return 



51 
 

the excess amount of ₱0.110 million to employees who were taxed in 
excess of the amount of tax due; and 

 
e. RO XIII, to review all transactions particularly the computation of the 

taxes withheld to adhere RMC No. 5-2006 and other related BIR 
provisions; and demand from the concerned suppliers the under-
withheld amount to avoid charges to persons liable. 

 
Hiring of and payments to job orders, contractual and consultants 
 
202. A total of 1,699 individuals covered with Contract of Service (COS) as of 

December 31, 2020 were hired on a semestral/quarterly basis, in accordance with 
CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1 dated June 15, 2017, as updated by CSC-
COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2, s 2020, dated October 20, 2020, to augment the 
regular plantilla and CTI employees of the EMB CO and 15 ROs of only 1,390 
positions. Their salaries were charged against Maintenance and Other Operating 
Expenses (MOOE) in the total amount of ₱315.793 million, as authorized under 
DBM Circular Letter (CL) No. 2013-5 dated July 22, 2013. 

 
GAD Budget, Utilization and Accomplishment 
 
203. The Agency failed to allocate at least five percent of the adjusted total general 

appropriation of the EMB of ₱3.355 billion since only ₱131.365 million or 3.92 
percent was programmed for GAD related activities, which was submitted to 
PCW, therefore, not in conformity with Section 31 of the General Provisions of 
the 2020 GAA. Moreover, various lapses/deficiencies were noted, thus, 
defeating the intent of the program to pursue women’s empowerment and 
gender equality. 

 
204. Section 31 of the General Provisions of the RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020 

explicitly provides that “The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities 
of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets.” 

 
205. Also, Item 4.3 of Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) Memorandum 

Circular 2020-03 or Adjustment and/or Implementation of the FY 2020 GAD Plan 
and Budget in view of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Situation requires that “The 
computation of the minimum five percent (5%) GAD budget as provided under 
Section 36(a) of the MCW shall be based on the total adjusted budget of the agency 
following National Budget Circular No. 580.” 

 
206. Item 5.1.2 PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides that “The result 

of gender analysis using sex-disaggregated data or information from major 
programs or services of the agency for its clients and gender gaps or issues faced 
by their women and men employees.” 

 



52 
 

207. The submitted Agency GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) of EMB CO and Regional 
Offices to PCW which was still under review by the latter as of November 27, 2020 
did not meet the five (5) percent requirement, pursuant to the above law, rules and 
regulations. 

 
208. Re-computation of the budget revealed that only 3.92 percent of the adjusted total 

general appropriation for CY 2020 was allotted by EMB for GAD Program, as 
follows:

% of GAD Budget to GAA 5.17 5.00 0.17 
% of Submitted GPB to Adj. 
New GA 3.92   

 
209. As can be gleaned from the table, the basis for the computation of the five percent 

requirement submitted to the PCW was ₱2.542 billion, which is less than the 
adjusted new general appropriation by ₱812.933 million, thus, making the allocated 
budget for GAD program decreased to only 3.92 percent. 

 
210. Further verification of the submitted GPB showed that the said budget was allotted 

for four client-focused activities, eight organization-focused activities and six 
attributed programs. 

 
211. The audit team noted with appreciation that EMB included the attribution of its 

major programs to the GAD budget, such as the Linis Hangin Program-
Formulation/Development of Policies on Air Quality, Identification/Delineation of 
Water Quality Management Areas Program, Ecological Solid Waste Management 
Program-Formulation/Development Program of Policies on Solid Waste, 
Ecological Solid Waste Management Program-Technical Assistance Program to 
LGUs Ecological Solid Waste Management, and Environmental Education & 
Information-Special Events Program for national environmental celebration. 
Attribution to the GAD budget of a portion or the whole of the budget of an 
agency’s major programs is a means toward gradually increasing the gender 
responsiveness of government programs and budgets pursuant to Section 6.4 of 
PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01. 

 
212. The non-allocation of at least five percent requirement for the GPB deprives the 

stakeholders/clients of the benefits it could get from the said funds and in 
addressing their needs pursuant to the above-mentioned regulations.

213. For CY 2020 the reported GAD allocation and utilization of individual EMB 
Offices except for CO and NCR amounted to ₱61.590 million and ₱68.691 million, 
respectively, shown below:

214. EMB CAR, II, III, IV-A, IV-B, V, VII, XII and XIII reported that all GAD planned 

activities were implemented while lapses and deficiencies were noted in the 
following: 

 
EMB Office Lapses/Deficiencies 

CO 

No sex-disaggregated data was established and maintained to support the 
gender analysis undertaken as required in Item 5.1.2 of PCW-NEDA-
DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01, which may result to inaccuracy for the 
analysis of gender issues in the Agency. According to the GAD 
Secretariat, collection or generation of gender statistics will be 
conducted in CY 2021. 

I Only three per cent of the total appropriations of ₱62.401 million or 
₱1.645 million was allocated for GAD programs and activities  

VI and X Not all of the planned activities were implemented due to the COVID-19 Pandemic constraints. 
VIII Utilized merely ₱3.748 million or 82.96 percent of the allocated funds 

for GAD despite the provision for it of ₱4.518 million or 4.95 percent of 
the agency’s budget thus, may have deprived beneficiaries of adequate 
services/benefits thereby hindering the attainment of the objectives of 
the program. 

XI Actual amount utilized for GAD activities was only 14 percent of the 
budget and that none of the organization-focused activities pertain to the 
measures enumerated in PCW MC 2020-03.

215. EMB RO XI Management explained that during the pandemic, the agency is 
transporting its personnel in going to the office and upon going home and have 
allowed its personnel to avail of the alternative work arrangements as allowed 
under the CSC guidelines, which may be attributed to GAD but were not included 
in the revised GPB since the revised GPB was submitted earlier than the 
implementation of the said measures and activities in the agency. 

 
216. The measures implemented by EMB RO XI in response to the pandemic that have 

GAD-related attributes should have formed part of the revised GPB and its 
accomplishment report detailing how these interventions address significant gender 
issues, needs and concerns as a result of the pandemic. However, due to their non-
inclusion in the GPB, these were not highlighted in the agency’s accomplishments 
which could have contributed to management’s attainment of targets. 

 
217. The non-inclusion of measures responsive to gender issues brought about by the 

Covid-19 pandemic in the GPB is not consistent with PCW Memorandum Circular 
2020-03, thus, did not accurately capture the agency’s implemented measures, 
programs and activities from which its women and men stakeholders have 
benefited. 

 
218. The Management commented that the PCW started to call for the submission of the 

2020 GPB in August 2019 and the EMB GAD Secretariat started the EMB 
Regional Offices GPB consolidation in June 2019. Since at that time, the actual 
GAA for 2020 was not yet approved, upon coordination with the EMB Policy, 
Planning and Program Development Division and AFMD, the National 
Expenditure Program of 2020 was used as basis for the consolidated GPB of EMB 
for 2020 to PCW. This forms parts of EMB’s compliance with PCW’s advance 
calendar submission of GPB. The adjusted and actual total GAA for 2020 will then 
be reflected in the GAD Accomplishment Report which is due for submission to 
PCW on March 12, 2021. 

 
219. Item 4.4 of the PCW Memorandum Circular 2020-03 provides that “Agencies with 

FY 2020 GPB that has been endorsed or is still under review by PCW have an 
option to submit an adjusted GPB until 01 July 2020 for (re-)endorsement of 
PCW…” 

 
220. Although the PCW had given the Agency the option of whether to submit or not the 

adjusted GPB, the same should have already been made available pursuant to Item 
4.1 of the same PCW Memorandum to ensure that the Agency would implement 
measures to address gender issues and concerns arising from the unequal status of 
their women and men stakeholders due to the COVID-19 situation. The 
Management should be vigilant in adopting updates regarding guidelines on GAD 
budgets, utilization and accomplishment. 

 
221. Thus, the Bureau is still not compliant with the provision of Section 31 of the 

General Provisions of the RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020. 



55 
 

222. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the: 
 

a. EMB CO GAD Coordinator and Secretariat to adhere to all applicable 
guidelines in the implementation of GAD programs to ensure sufficient 
budget allocation for the GAD projects and activities and integration in 
the agencies’ regular activities in order to fully address gender issues and 
concerns of the Agency nationwide; and strictly ensure the establishment 
and maintenance of sex-disaggregated data; and 

 
b. GAD focal persons of EMB ROs VIII and XI to consider including 

measures and interventions that appropriately address gender issues, 
needs and concerns relative to the COVID-19 situation in the agency’s 
GPB for FY 2021, as applicable/necessary. 

 
Non-allocation and/or utilization of fund for SCPD programs/activities 
 
223. Nine ROs implemented programs/projects intended to address the concerns of 

the SCPD while EMB CO and eight ROs provided structural features on its 
building to enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of PWDs as required 
under Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA FY 2020. However, 
EMB CO, NCR, I and XIII failed to formulate plans or fully accomplish 
programs and projects that addressed the concerns of SCs and PWDs. 

 
224. Section 32, General Provisions of the GAA FY 2020 requires that all agencies of 

the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address 
the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to 
their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities. 

 
225. Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide architectural 

or structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, 
safety and welfare of persons with disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Bilang 
344 and RA No. 7277, as amended. 

 
226. For CY 2020, EMB NCR, CAR, I, III, IV-B, V, VI, VIII, and X spent ₱2.755 

million in the implementation of programs/projects intended to address the 
concerns of the senior citizens and persons with disability (SCPD) in accordance 
with the provisions of the RA No. 11465. 

 
227. Likewise, EMB CO, NCR, II, III, IV-B, V, VI, XI and XII complied in 

providing/maintaining the structural features on its building to enhance the 
mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability (PWDs). 

 
228. Further, EMB RO IV-A formulated plans and programs for SCs and PWDs with 

allocated amount of ₱1.411 million pursuant to Section 32 of the RA No. 11465. 
 

https://fsymbols.com/signs/peso/
https://fsymbols.com/signs/peso/


56 
 

229. Also, EMB RO XIII did not create nor mainstream to its regular activities for SCs 
and PWDs during the year as these cannot be implemented considering the 
restrictions and protocols imposed to the concerned sectors during COVID-19 
pandemic. Thus, there were no disbursements relating to these activities for CY 
2020. 

 
230. Under or non-accomplished planned activities were also noted in EMB CO, NCR, I 

and IV-A due to the following reasons: 
 

 no focal person for SCs and PWDs concerns was designated in CY 2020 that 
will manage the Program budget and its implementation to facilitate the 
monitoring and implementation of the said Program in EMB CO; 

 
 under-accomplished Pasasalamat Program of one retiree was due to the 

decision of the retiree to extend his service for another year in EMB NCR; 
 

 only two out of the five planned activities were accomplished by EMB RO I 
to address the concerns of the SCs and PWDs due to the crisis brought about 
by the COVID-19; and 

 
 planned activities of EMB RO IV-A which consist of Information, Education 

and Communication (IEC) Campaign and various trainings, seminars/ 
workshops were not implemented due to COVID-19 pandemic that resulted 
to the strict restrictions or quarantine for people specially those who are 
seniors and with health conditions. 

 
231. While the above-cited reasons for the non-accomplishment of the activities is 

acceptable given the current pandemic situation, however, it is incumbent upon the 
Management to address the existing conditions and manage the existing and 
emerging risks such as revising the WFPs for SCs and PWDs. 

 
232. Thus, the non-formulation/integration of PAPs for SCs and PWDs as well as the 

non-preparation of a revised WFP to manage with the current pandemic situation 
deprives the SCs and PWDs of the benefits it could get from the said funds and in 
addressing their needs pursuant to the above-mentioned regulations. 

 
233. We recommended and Management agreed that: 

 
a. EMB CO designate a focal person to be responsible for the management 

of SCs and PWDs Program budget and implementation; 
 

b. EMB CO and NCR ensure the implementation of the activities to address 
the needs of SCs and PWDs pursuant to Section 32 of the General 
Provisions of the GAA for CY 2020; and 

 



57 
 

c. EMB ROs I and XIII comply with the requirements of the GAA of 
formulating plans, programs and projects intended to address the 
concerns of senior citizens and differently-abled persons, insofar as it 
relates to EMB mandated functions, and integrate the same in its regular 
activities. 

 
Implementation of ODA Funded Projects 
 
234. The agency did not receive funds for Official Development Assistance (ODA) 

Funded Projects for this year, thus, no utilization as required under Republic Act 
(RA) No. 8182 (as amended), or the ODA Act of 1996. 

 
Receipt and Utilization of Disaster Related Fund 
 
235. The 12 EMB Offices did not receive and disburse Disaster Risk Reduction 

Management (DRRM) Fund and/or Quick Response Fund (QRF) for this 
year, thus, no utilization for disaster risk reduction or mitigation, prevention 
and preparedness activities and for relief, recovery, reconstruction and other 
work services in connection with natural or human-induced calamities. 
However, Bangon Marawi Funds obligated in CY 2019 for the implementation 
of Solid Waste Management in Marawi City has low disbursement rate 
indicating slow implementation of various projects and inability of 
Management to effectively maximize the utilization of the funds entrusted to 
the Office. 

 
236. EO No. 91 provides the guidelines on the Adoption of the Cash Budgeting System 

(CBS) effective 01 January 2019. Section 1 states that: 
 

a.  “All authorized appropriations shall be available for obligation and 
disbursement only until the end of each fiscal year (FY); 

 
b.  Payments for obligations incurred shall be made until the end of the 

extended payment period (EPP), which shall be three (3) months 
after the end of the validity of appropriations against which they 
were obligated, unless another period has been determined by the 
Department of Budget and Management (DBM), upon consultation 
with relevant agencies.” 

 
237. Moreover, Section 2 of the same EO stipulates that: “Any unreleased 

appropriations and unobligated allotments at the end of the FY, as well as unpaid 
obligations and undisbursed funds at the end of the extended payment period shall 
revert to the National Treasury and shall not thereafter be available for 
expenditure, except by subsequent legislative enactment.” 

 
238. Likewise, Section 65 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2019 further 

provides that “all appropriations authorized shall be available for release and 



58 
 

obligation for the purpose specified, and under the same special provisions 
applicable thereto, until December 31, 2019.” 

 
239. Except for EMB RO X, all other EMB Offices did not receive and disburse DRRM 

Fund and/or QRF for this year, thus, no utilization for disaster risk reduction or 
mitigation, prevention and preparedness activities and for relief, recovery, 
reconstruction and other work services in connection with natural or human-
induced calamities. 

 
240. Review of the disbursements made by the EMB RO X revealed that out of the 

₱321.527 million obligations incurred by the agency in CY 2019 only ₱48.541 
million or 15 percent were disbursed leaving an unpaid obligation amounting to 
₱272.986 million in CY 2020. 

 
241. The details of the unpaid obligations are shown below:

242. As shown in the table above and per inquiry, the low disbursement rate was 

attributed to the non-delivery of the equipment and the delayed implementation of 
the Sanitary Landfill Construction Project due to conflict as to the ownership of the 
land to be used of the construction site. 

 
243. The Audit Team recognized that under RA No. 11464, which amended Section 65 

of the General Provisions of the FY 2019 GAA, the availability of disbursements of 
the FY 2019 appropriations was extended up to December 31, 2021 for infra-
related Capital Outlay (CO). However, with the project’s low disbursement rate of 

https://fsymbols.com/signs/peso/
https://fsymbols.com/signs/peso/
https://fsymbols.com/signs/peso/


59 
 

15 percent as of December 31, 2020, it becomes uncertain if the agency will be able 
to utilize its remaining allotments by December 31, 2021. 

 
244. It should be emphasized that delayed implementation of the projects of the 

government will negatively affect the performance of the agency and will redound 
to the disadvantage of the end-users and/or beneficiaries thereof. 

 
245. During the CY 2020 Exit Conference, it was explained by Management that they 

have ongoing conflicts and issues concerning the rights to the property purchased 
by the agency for the construction of a sanitary landfill in Marawi City which 
resulted in delay in the implementation of the said project. They have yet to resolve 
this issue and are actually considering a different site for the said landfill. 

 
246. We recommended and Management of RO X agreed to institute measures to 

ensure timely implementation of projects/programs to make sure that the 
utilization of the intended funds and completion of the projects will be made 
within the prescribed period allowed by the existing laws. 

 
Audit suspensions, disallowances, charges and settlement 
 
247. Notices of Suspension (NSs) and Notices of Disallowance (NDs) were issued for 

transactions audited during the year amounting to ₱58.566 million due to non-
compliance with various laws, rules and regulations. Moreover, only the 
amount of ₱28.964 million was settled with corresponding Notices of 
Settlement of Suspension, Disallowance and Charge (NSSDCs) issued during 
the year, leaving unsettled suspensions, disallowances and charges amounting 
to ₱63.632 million as of December 31, 2020. 

 
248. COA Circular No. 2009-006 or the Revised Rules of Settlement of Accounts dated 

September 15, 2009 provides, among others, that: 
 

Section 9.1 - “The Auditor shall issue a Notice of Suspension (NS) for 
transactions of doubtful legality/propriety/regularity which may result 
in pecuniary loss of the government, and which will be disallowed in 
audit if not satisfactorily explained or validly justified by the parties 
concerned.” 

 
Section 9.4 - “A suspension should be settled within ninety (90) 
calendar days from receipt of the NS; otherwise the transaction covered 
by it shall be disallowed/charged after the Auditor shall have satisfied 
himself that such action is appropriate.” 

 
Section 10.1 - “The Auditor shall issue a Notice of Disallowance (ND) 
for transactions which are irregular/unnecessary/excessive and 
extravagant as defined in COA Circular No. 85-55A as well as other 
COA issuances, and those which are illegal and unconscionable.” 

 



60 
 

Section 10.4 - “The disallowance shall be settled within six (6) months 
from receipt of ND by the persons liable.” 

 
Section 11.1.1 – “The Auditor shall issue the Notice of Charge (NC) if 
the amount assessed/appraised is less than what is due the government, 
the difference shall be a proper audit charge.” 

 
Section 13 - “The Auditor shall issue the Notice of Settlement of 
Suspension/ Disallowance/Charge (NSSDC) whenever a 
suspension/disallowance or charge is settled.” 

 
Section 22.2 – “The NFD shall be issued by the authorized COA official 
to the agency head to notify that a decision of the Auditor, Director, 
ASB or CP has become final and executory, there being no appeal or 
motion for reconsideration filed within the reglementary period.” 

 
249. Section 7.1.1 of the same Circular also requires the head of agency, who is 

primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his 
agency, to ensure that the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within 
the prescribed period and the requirements of transactions suspended in audit are 
complied with. 

 
250. Out of the total audit suspensions of ₱56.784 million, disallowances of ₱35.782 

million, and charges of ₱0.029 million (beginning balance and issued this year), a 
very minimal amount of settlements of ₱28.964 million, were reported during the 
year, thus, leaving a balance of ₱63.632 million as summarized below:

amounting to ₱35.782 million, leaving a balance of unsettled disallowances 
amounting to ₱35.153 million. 

 
255. For audit charges in EMB CO and NCR amounting to ₱0.030 million, ₱0.015 

million or 50 percent was settled during the year, leaving unsettled charges 
amounting to ₱0.015 million as of year-end.

256. In EMB CO, the suspensions issued for lacking documentary requirements and 
disallowances for illegal/irregular transactions, all issued by the special audit teams 
in connection with the audit of the Hydro Chlorofluorocarbons Phase out 
Management Plan (HCFC HPMP) Stage 1 and Philippine Ozone Desk – 
Institutional Strengthening Project (POD-ISP) of the Environmental Management 
Bureau (EMB) covering the Calendar Years 2014 to 2017 and January 2016 to 
March 2018 under COA Office Order No. 2020-257 dated June 18, 2020. 

 
257. The status/updates on the disallowances as of December 31, 2020 are shown below: 

 
EMB Office Status/Updates 

CO Out of the outstanding balance of NDs of ₱23.142 million, ₱0.612 million 
were already issued with NFDs while ₱2.245 million were under appeal with 
the Commission, and ₱16.852 million were with Decision from NGS Cluster-
8 and/or Commission Proper but no NFDs yet as of December 31, 2020. 
Moreover, ₱0.160 million was approved for installment payment by the 
Prosecution and Litigation Office, Legal Services Sector, this Commission. 

NCR Out of the outstanding balance of NDs of ₱0.588 million, ₱0.068 million was 
with Decision from NGS Cluster-8 but no NFD was issued yet as of 
December 31, 2020. Moreover, of the ₱0.165 million approved for installment 
payment by the Prosecution and Litigation Office, Legal Services Sector, this 
Commission on October 4, 2017, no amount was collected for CY 2020. 

CAR The unsettled disallowances amounting to ₱0.739 million were covered by 
ND in 2017 amounting to ₱0.661 million which was appealed to the 
Commission Proper in August 2018 and three NDs in 2020 which are 
continuously being settled by the persons liable through payroll deduction and 
cash payments. 

III Of the prior years’ 41 NDs outstanding as of year-end of ₱2.603 million, 37 
NDs amounting to ₱0.491 million were under appeal to the COA Regional 
Office while the other NDs is being settled through salary deduction of the 
concerned persons liable. 

VII The outstanding balance included dormant receivables from separated 
employees ranging from three to five years amounting to ₱0.132 million. 
Whereas, total installment payments of disallowed Magna Carta benefits of 
CY 2016 after more than three years or 40 months totaling ₱0.287 million is 
only 66 percent of the total disallowance of ₱0.432 million without approval 
from the Commission on Audit and was not in accordance with COA 
Resolution No. 2017-021 dated November 3, 2017. 

VIII For issuance of NFD, however supporting DVs/Payrolls were damaged by 
storm surge of typhoon Yolanda and some are settled per submitted List from 
agency, but is still subject to verification by the audit team. 

XI Of the unsettled disallowance of ₱0.165 million, ₱0.131 million is currently 
on appeal, hence only the amount of ₱0.034 million was reflected in the books 
as of December 31, 2020. 

 
258. EMB CO did not send demand letters to the persons responsible/liable to enforce 

immediate settlement of suspensions, disallowances and charges as of December 
31, 2020; however, they assure that they will demand in 2021. 
 
 



64 
 

259. EMB NCR did not send demand letters since the Agency has been deducting the 
liabilities from the salaries of the persons liable for two the NDs but only one ND 
was requested for installment payment and approved by the Commission. 
Installment settlement through payroll deductions can only be made unless allowed 
by the Commission per COA Resolution No. 2017-021 dated November 03, 2017. 
 

260. The EMB RO VI had sent demand letters to those retired and separated from the 
service, however, the concerned payees were not able to make any reply/action on 
these letters. Furthermore, the Accountant was not able to determine the other 
persons liable as the EMB had no copies of the prior year’s Notices of 
Disallowances. The Audit Team had likewise no copies of the said NDs since there 
was no turn-over from the previous Audit Team. 
 

261. The Head of the Agency failed to carry out his responsibility in enforcing the 
settlement of audit disallowances, which could have generated a higher percentage 
of recoveries of disallowed payments. In view thereof, a low settlement was 
realized during the year of only ₱0.629 million or 1.76 percent out of the audit 
disallowances amounting to ₱35.782 million. Also, non-compliance with the laws, 
rules and regulations resulted in audit suspensions and disallowances/charges. 
 

262. Disallowances issued prior to the effectivity of the Rules and Regulations on the 
Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) are not included in the reflected balance but are 
deemed disallowances which shall continue to be enforced in accordance with these
