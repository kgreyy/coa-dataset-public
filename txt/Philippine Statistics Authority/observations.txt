OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

Financial Audit  
 
Accounting Errors/Omissions 
 
1. Various errors and omissions in the keeping of the accounts had affected the 

completeness and accuracy of account balances reported in the financial 

statements. 

 

Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 
states that the Financial Statements (FSs) shall present fairly the financial position, 
financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the 
faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, 
and expenses set out in the IPSAS. Section 29 (b) of IPSAS 1 also states that a fair 
presentation also requires an entity to present information, including accounting 
policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable, and understandable 
information. 

 
Examination and analysis of the accounts and transactions of the Philippine 

Statistics Authority (PSA) disclosed various errors/omissions that have impact on the 
fair presentation of the year-end balances of assets, liabilities, and net assets/equity, as 
presented in Table 1.

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned 

personnel of the Accounting Division and Accountants of Regional Statistical 

Services Offices (RSSOs) to prepare the necessary adjusting journal entries to 

correct the accounting errors/omissions; henceforth, observe the proper/correct 

recognition of accounts and transactions in accordance with the GAM for NGAs 

and other applicable rules and regulations. 

 
 

Accounting Deficiencies 
 
2. A number of accounts were either misclassified, with unreconciled balances, 

and/or not properly documented, thus, accuracy, reliability and regularity of the 

same cannot be fully ascertained. 

 
Section 6 (e), Chapter 19, Volume I of GAM for NGAs on Qualitative 

Characteristics of Financial Reporting, states that an entity shall present information 
including accounting policies in a manner that meets the following qualitative 
characteristics enumerated in IPSAS 1: 
 



  

78 
 

(e)  Reliability - reliable information is free from material error and bias, and 
can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to 
represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. 
 
Analysis of the accounts and supporting documents revealed accounting 

deficiencies arising from misclassification, unreconciled balances and or/not properly 
documented affecting the accounts, as shown in Table 2.

Section 20, 
Chapter 10, 
Volume I, GAM 
for NGAs  

 
In view of cross-cutting issues, the accounting deficiencies discussed below 

also includes compliance issues and the corresponding recommendations. 
 

a. Non-remittance of Government Share from the proceeds of User Fees 
generated thru the CRS totaling to P225.125 million and $9,330.14  
 

Section 4.3.1 of JC No. 03-01 dated December 2003, prescribing the 
guidelines in the processing of receipts arising from Build-Operate-Transfer 
(BOT) transaction and its variant schemes, provides that on a daily basis, the 
Agency shall establish the amount due to the government and instruct the 
Authorized Government Depository Bank (AGDB) to remit the same to the 
National Treasury through an automatic credit advice mechanism. A copy of 
the credit advice shall be furnished by the Agency to the National Treasury.  

 
The Concession Agreement executed on September 30, 2016 between 

the PSA and Unisys Managed Service Corporation (Unisys) for the Civil 
Registry System-Information Technology Project Phase II (CRS-ITP2) defines 
User Fees as a fee payable by the client in consideration of its availing of 
particular CRS-ITP2 Services. The sharing agreement between the PSA and 
Unisys was 54.5 per cent and 45.5 per cent, respectively, on every User Fee 
collected by the PSA after deducting the Documentary Stamp Tax. As provided 
in Section 1.2, Schedule 12 of the concession agreement, the share of the 
Grantor, the PSA, shall be remitted immediately on the first hour of the next 
day by instructing the Account Bank to credit the corresponding amount in 
favor of the National Treasury.   



  

81 
 

 

However, as verbally agreed upon between the BTr and PSA, the 
amount of P2.000 million shall be remitted daily to the BTr representing the 
PSA’s share in the User Fees collected. Thus, it is the practice of the Accounting 
Division that the amount of P2.000 million is remitted daily to the BTr in 
compliance with Section 4.3.1 of JC No. 03-01. Monthly reconciliation is being 
undertaken to determine whether there is an over or under remittance to the BTr 
taking into consideration the daily remittance of P2.000 million.  If there is an 
under remittance, the amount is remitted to the BTr in the following month. On 
the other hand, in case of excess remittance, the amount will be deducted from 
the amount to be remitted in the following month.  

 

Examination of the Cash in Bank-Local Currency Current Account and 
Cash in Bank- Local Currency Savings Account revealed that the daily 
remittance of P2.000 million by the PSA to the BTr was not done in CY 2020. 
As a result, the amount of P285.653 million remained in the Cash in Bank-Local 
Currency Current Account and Cash in Bank- Local Currency Savings Account 
of the PSA which could have been used by the government in responding to the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic, in compliance with Section 
4 (w) of Republic Act (RA) No. 11469 dated March 24, 2020 which provides 
that all such unspent, unutilized or unreleased money or funds sourced from 
collections or receipts, including future collections receipts, shall be utilized 
and are hereby appropriated for measures to address the COVID-19 situation. 

 
In CY 2020, the total amount collected by the PSA from the CRS was 

P1,721.789 million. Of this amount, a total of P618.355 million was remitted to 
Unisys representing the share of the latter in the User Fees collected by the PSA 
net of Final Value Added Tax (VAT) and Expanded Withholding Tax withheld 
by the Accounting Division amounting to P49.406 million.  The total amount 
of P444.712 million was remitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) 
which includes the amount of P49.406 million representing the taxes withheld 
from the claims of Unisys and the Documentary Stamp Tax collected 
amounting to P395.306 million while the amount of P39,345.00 was remitted 
to the Philippine National Bank (PNB) as payment for the e-collect charges in 
using the CRS. Likewise, the amount of P384.655 million was also remitted to 
the BTr in compliance with Section 4 (w) of RA No. 11469, leaving a balance 
of P274.028 million that must be remitted by the PSA to the BTr representing 
the government share in User Fees collected by the PSA.  

 
Since all liabilities were already paid and only the share of Unisys of 

P48.903 million for the month of December 2020 remained unpaid, therefore, 
the amount of P225.125 million, net of the unpaid share of Unisys of P48.903 
million should have been remitted to the BTr.   

 
Inquiry with the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the Accounting Division 

for the non-remittance of the P225.125 million to the BTr disclosed that before 
CY 2020, the BTr coordinated and instructed the PSA Accounting Division to 



  

82 
 

deposit P2.000 million daily as advance remittance for the Government Share 
from the CRS. It was only in CY 2020 that the Accounting Division discovered 
that there had been an over remittance of Government Share to the BTr since 
the daily remittance of P2.000 million is actually higher than the actual 54.5 per 
cent government share of the CRS collections. As such, the Accounting 
Division stopped the practice of remitting the amount of P2.000 million daily 
as advance remittance of Government Share and decided to reconcile the 
collections and remittances arising from the CRS.  

 
On the other hand, the collection of PSA in foreign currency in the 

amount of $10,586.53 arising from the CRS collection overseas were not also 
remitted to the BTr. The amount of $10,586.53 includes the unaccounted 
deposit and net of debit memos amounting to $1,256.39 and $7,186.92, 
respectively. The unaccounted deposit and debit advices were not recorded in 
the books due to the absence of credit and debit memos from the Land Bank of 
the Philippines (LBP).  

 
According to the Accounting Division, it is in close coordination with 

the LBP to secure the credit and debit memos and will record the amount once 
it is identified. It also informed that the amount of $9,330.14, exclusive of the 
$1,256.39 will be remitted to the BTr and the remaining amount will be remitted 
once it is identified by the Accounting Division using the credit memos 
submitted by the LBP.  

 
We recommended and Management agreed to direct the OIC-

Chief, Accounting Division to: (a) remit immediately the total amount of 

P225.125 million  and $9,330.14 to the BTr; (b) coordinate with the LBP to 

secure the credit and debit  memos on the unaccounted deposit  in the 

amount of $1,256.39 and unaccounted debit memos amounting to 

$7,186.92; and (c) thereafter, remit immediately the amount of identified 

deposit to the BTr. 

 

We also recommended that Management make a representation 

with the BTr to discuss and formulate a policy for establishing the amount 
of daily remittance by the PSA to the BTr in compliance with Section 4(w) 

of RA No. 11469 to avoid over remittance of Government Share. 
 

b. Non-remittance of various trust receipts to the BTr - P15.340 million 
 

Section 6 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 requires 
that the following collections, among others, be deposited with the National 
Treasury and recorded as Trust Receipts: (a) receipts collected or received by 
departments, bureaus, offices and instrumentalities of the National 
Government, among others, as a guarantee for the fulfillment of an obligation, 
and (b) those classified by law or regulations as trust receipts. 

 



  

83 
 

Verification of the PSA’s Trust Liabilities showed that the total amount 
of P15.340 million were not remitted to the BTr. The details are presented in 
Table 3.

Amount (in P) 
Particulars/Remarks 

1. Funds from the 
Department of Health 
(DOH) 

11,789,423.75  
 

The PSA and DOH executed a MOA on 
November 11, 2014 to conduct a nationwide 
survey, which includes field enumeration, 
data management and processing of results, 
under the project named “Global Adult 
Tobacco Survey” (GATS). The project 
covered a period of 16 months, from 
September 2014 to December 2015. The 
DOH transferred funds amounting to P29.000 
million to the PSA per Official Receipt (OR) 
No. 19413364 dated February 13, 2015 to 
cover the implementation of the project. The 
MOA stated that the PSA shall return the 
balance of the funds to DOH upon demand. 
 
Audit of the subsidiary ledger (SL) showed 
that the amount of P17.211 million has 
already been liquidated leaving the balance of 
P11.789 million as of June 30, 2020. Inquiry 
with the Accountant disclosed that the project 
had already ended and liquidation reports 
were already recorded in the books. However, 
the remaining balance was not yet remitted to 
the BTr as the PSA is awaiting for the demand 
of the DOH to return the excess fund. 

2. Donations/ 
Contributions 
received for the 
celebration of the 30th 
NSM 

3,550,185.95  
 

Presidential Proclamation No. 647 dated 
September 20, 1990 declared the month of 
October of every year as the National 
Statistics Month (NSM). In view thereof, the 
PSA, together with Bangko Sentral ng 
Pilipinas (BSP) held a joint opening 
ceremony in celebration of the 30th NSM on 
October 29, 2019.   Pursuant to Item No.7 of 
PSA Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2019-
07 dated March 25, 2019, the PSA requested 
various government agencies to contribute at 
P20,000.00 for the purpose of funding the 
additional conduct of NSM activities and the 
PSA was designated to administer the NSM 
fund. As at December 31, 2020, the balance 
of the National Convention on Statistics Fund 
was P3.550 million. The amount represents 
the accumulated registration fees collected by 
PSA from various agencies intended for the 
expenses to be incurred in conducting the 
activities in relation to the NSM such as 
interagency forum, publicity and promotional 
materials and other activities. Since the

activities were already concluded, the balance 
should be remitted to the BTr in compliance 
with Section 6 of the General Provisions of 
the GAA for FY 2020. 

Total 15,339,609.70  
 
The Accounting Division commented that it is awaiting for the 

certification of the Sectoral Statistical Office that the fund is free and can be 
remitted to the BTr. 

  
As a result, the accuracy and rights of the balances of the accounts Cash-

Treasury/Agency, Trust and Trust Liabilities at year-end cannot be ascertained.  
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the OIC-

Chief Accountant to: (a) deposit the excess balance of the completed 

projects and collection from the proceeds of registration fees amounting to 

P15.340 million; and (b) thereafter, prepare the necessary entries to accrue 

the income to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) of the General Fund, in 

consonance with laws, rules and regulations.   

 
c. Unreverted dormant/outstanding Accounts Payable for two years and above - 

P47.332 million  
 

Section 3.1 of Department of Budget and Management (DBM) -COA 
JC No. 99-6 provides that, “All documented Accounts Payables of all funds 
which have remained outstanding for two years shall be reverted to the 
Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit), except on-going capital outlays projects.” This 
provision was reiterated in EO No. 87 dated August 13, 2019.  It was stated in 
Section 1 of the EO that all documented accounts payable which remain 
outstanding for at least two years, for which no actual administrative or judicial 
claim has been filed, shall be subject to automatic reversion. 
 

In PSA-CO, RSSOs II and IVA, verification of the Accounts Payable 
with a year-end balance of P1.372 billion, and the related schedule showed that 
payable accounts totaling P47.332 million had ages two years and above were 
still recorded in the books of accounts.  The said amount should have been 
automatically reverted to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 1 of EO No. 87. The details are presented in Table 4.

85 
 

Inquiry with the Accountant revealed that most of the balances in the 
Accounts Payable aged two years and above were still unpaid as at December 
31, 2020 due to the non-submission of supporting documents despite constant 
communication with the suppliers. Also, the amount was not yet reverted 
because it is the understanding of the Accounting Division that when the time 
that the suppliers/contractors submitted their claims, these cannot be paid 
because these were already reverted to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit). Some of 
the payables are ongoing projects of the agency, and others are for 
reconciliation by the Accounting Division. 

  

Section 3 of EO No. 87 provides that in the event that reverted accounts 
payable are subsequently validated by competent authorities or by final and 
executor decisions, the funding therefore shall be determined by the DBM 
subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations.  Therefore, even if the 
accounts payable is reverted, management can request fund from the DBM once 
the claim of the certain contractor/supplier for the service or goods delivered 
was validated by the management.   
 

 As a result, the balances of the accounts Accounts Payable and 
Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) at year-end were unreliable.  

 
We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the OIC-

Chief, Accountant of the PSA-CO, and the Regional Directors (RDs)of 

RSSO II and IVB to comply with the requirements on the reversion of the 

Accounts Payable with ages of more than two years. 

 
d. Discrepancies between the books of PSA-CO/RSSO V and PS - P2.767 million 

 

EO No. 40, s. 2001, provides that common-use supplies, materials and 
equipment shall be procured from the PS of the DBM. 

 
Audit of the account Due from National Government Agencies in PSA-

CO and RSSO V revealed that there were discrepancies of P2.767 million 
between the balances recorded in the books of PSA-CO and RSSO V and the 
amount confirmed by the PS. The discrepancies can be attributable to the 
beginning balances from BAS and NSCB amounting to P318,657.01 and 
unaccounted balances in the amount of P2.448 million which is subject for 
reconciliation of the Accounting Division with the PS. As a result, the accuracy 
and existence of the account balance at year-end in the amount of P433.148 
million cannot be ascertained.  

 
We recommended and Management agreed to require the OIC-

Chief Accountant and Provincial Accountant to coordinate with the PS for 

the reconciliation of their respective records to reflect the correct balance 

of the account Due from National Government Agencies and various 

affected accounts at year-end.  



  

86 
 

e. Unutilized fund transfer to PS-CO for GFA - P0.693 million  
 

The MOA between the PSA and PS executed on April 12, 2018, 
provides that the PS will automatically return the unexpended balance of the 
Fund upon termination or immediately after expiration of the agreement. It was 
noted, however, that the expiration date was not stipulated in the MOA. 

 
In addition, the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) in its 

Resolution No. 21-2019 dated September 5, 2019 approves the delisting of 
airline tickets under the GFA in the list of common-use supplies and equipment 
of the PS, quoted as follows:  

 
“that procuring entities are no longer mandated to purchase 
their airline ticket requirements from the GFA”.  

 
Analysis of the account Due from National Government Agencies 

showed that the amount of P0.935 million represents the total amount 
transferred to PS for the procurement of airline tickets through GFA.  The initial 
deposit of P200,000.00 for Philippine Airlines and P100,000.00 for Cebu 
Pacific or a total of P300,000.00 were transferred in CYs 2018 and 2019.  In 
CY 2019, an additional amount of P0.635 million was transferred to increase 
the credit limit despite the non-utilization of the initial deposit of P300,000.00 
in CYs 2018 and 2019.  

 
As at December 31, 2020, of the total amount of P0.935 million 

transferred to the PS, the amount expended was only P242,239.18 which 
remained unrecorded in the books due to the absence of liquidation reports 
coming from the PS, thus casting doubt on the reliability of the balance of the 
Due from National Government Agencies at year-end and Traveling Expenses 
for the year. Moreover, the amount of P0.693 million was still in the account of 
PS which could have been utilized for other projects and activities of the 
agency.  

 
We recommended and Management agreed to require the RDs of 

RSSO VIII to direct the Regional Accountant to: (a) request for the 

statement of account (SOA) including the supporting document for the 

expended amount P242,239.18 from PS for the GFA fund; (b)  reconcile 

the submitted SOA and supporting documents with the books of accounts 

and draw necessary adjusting entries to correct the account balance at 

year-end; and (c) thereafter, demand the refund from PS of the 

unexpended balances based on the reconciliation made.  
 

f. Non-elimination of reciprocal accounts (Intra-Agency) - P78.447 million   
 

Accounting practice dictates that reciprocal accounts should be 
reconciled and balances eliminated at the end of the accounting period to reflect 



  

87 
 

complete recording of transactions and present the true financial position and 
performance of the agency. Thus, these reciprocal accounts should have zero 
balance after elimination.  

 
In the consolidation of financial statements, balances, transactions, 

revenues, and expenses between entities within the economic entity shall be 
eliminated in full. 

 
PSA-CO transferred funds to implement various projects to the RSSOs 

and duly recorded as Due from Regional Offices while the RSSOs record the 
receipt of the funds as Due to Central Office.  Out of the funds transferred to 
the RSSOs, payment of expenses for the implementation of projects to their 
respective PSOs is recorded as Due from Operating/Field Units and the receipt 
of funds by the provincial offices as Due to Regional Offices. 

 
This is a reiteration of prior year’s audit observation of which the 

balances of the intra-agency accounts were not yet eliminated as at December 
31, 2020, as presented in Table 5. 

 
Table 5 - Discrepancies of Reciprocal Accounts  

Account 
Amounts (in P)  

Balance Variance 

Due from Regional Offices 87,834,660.47  
Due to Central Office (18,228,845.13) 69,605,815.34 
Due from Operating/Field Units 8,364,756.63  
Due to Regional Offices (3,017,561.12) 5,347,195.51 
Total  74,953,010.85 

 
The variance can be attributed to the fund transfer for the payment of 

salaries and wages of Job Orders/Service Contractors hired by the PSA way 
back in CY 2015 which handled the Civil Registry System - Information 
Technology Project 1 (CRS-ITP 1) in all PSOs in the amount of P32.000 million 
or 42.69 per cent which as at December 31, 2020 remained unliquidated, while 
the balance of P42.952 million refers to the various projects which were already 
completed. 

 
Moreover, the long outstanding unliquidated fund transfer to RSSOs can 

be attributed to the non/delayed submission of liquidation reports in view of the 
requirements of COA Circular No. 2012-001 that the liquidation report must be 
duly audited by the COA Auditor of the implementing agency. In addition, 
some Accountants who handled the recording and liquidation of fund transfers 
in the RSSOs have already resigned from the service and the liquidation reports 
submitted to the Office of the Regional Auditors cannot be located by the new 
Accountant, thus, majority of the fund transfers to the RSSOs were still 
unliquidated at year-end.  

 



  

88 
 

It was also admitted by the Accounting Division that the there were 
delays in the submission of the liquidation reports from the RSSOs due to the 
absence of written policy that requires the Accountants/Bookkeepers of various 
RSSOs and PSOs to submit the monthly liquidation report.  However, verbal 
instructions on the submission of the scanned monthly liquidation reports 
including the attachment were already disseminated to various RSSOs and 
PSOs.  Also, monthly submission of scanned copy of liquidation reports, 
together with the attached documents was included as one of the Key 
Performance Indicators (KPI) in granting the Performance Based Bonus (PBB) 
for the Accountants/Bookkeepers of various RSSOs and PSOs. The OIC-Chief 
Accountant further disclosed that there is an ongoing reconciliation of the Due 
from Regional Offices. 

 
Likewise, review and verification of accounting records in RSSOs NCR 

and III showed that the accounts “Due from Operating/Field Units” and “Due 
to Regional Offices” had also a difference of P3.493 million. In RSSO-NCR, 
the difference of P1.930 million represents the unrecorded liquidation due to 
the incomplete supporting documents submitted by the PSOs to RSSO. In 
RSSO III, the difference of P1.563 million was due to the unrecorded 
liquidation reports of the current year in the amount of P130,460.00 and prior 
years’ liquidations which the copies of liquidation reports need to be located 
and retrieved totaling to P1.433 million.  

 
Interview with the Regional Accountant also disclosed that upon her 

assumption in September 2017, she traced back unposted liquidation reports 
from the records of CY 2016 and prior years’ fund transfers. However, not all 
copies of liquidation reports from the provinces were located. She further 
explained that reports and accounting files were kept in the storeroom and that 
said liquidation reports need to be retrieved for recording in the books and to 
effect adjustments, if any. 

 
We recommended and Management agreed to require the OIC-

Chief Accountant to: (a) draft a policy on the liquidation of fund transfer 

which include among others, the submission of the monthly liquidation 

reports including the attachments and the deadline for submission and 

submit to the National Statistician for approval; (b) disseminate the 

approved policy to the Accountants/Bookkeepers of various RSSOs and 

PSOs; and (c) monitor the submission of the liquidation reports including 

the attachments, as well as the recording of the liquidation and refund of 

excess of fund transfer in the  books of accounts. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to direct the RDs 

of RSSOs NCR and III to: (a)  require the Bookkeepers of PSOs to submit 

all supporting documents necessary for the liquidation of the fund transfer 

to facilitate the recording in the books of account; and (b) require the 

Regional Accountants to exert effort to locate the liquidation reports 



  

89 
 

submitted by the PSOs and take up the liquidation reports submitted in 

CY 2020 and effect adjustments to reflect the correct balances of the 

accounts. 

 

We further reiterated our recommendation that Management 

require the CO OIC-Chief Accountant and RSSO Accountants to reconcile 

the noted differences with the Operating Units/Regional Offices to 

eliminate the intra-agency receivables and payables of prior years in 

consonance with accounting rules and regulations. 

 

g. Undisposed unserviceable properties - P9.052 million 
 

Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides the procedures for and modes of 
disposal of government property that has become unserviceable for any cause, 
or is no longer needed.  Likewise, Section 40 (d), Chapter 10, Volume I, GAM 
for NGAs, requires that all unserviceable property shall be reported in the 
Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) as a basis 
to record dropping from the books the unserviceable properties carried in the 
PPE accounts. 

 
Review of the Property, Plant and Equipment and Other Assets 

accounts disclosed that unserviceable properties of RSSOs III, IVA, VI and XIII 
totaling P9.053 million remained undisposed, hence it does not only continue 
to occupy the storage area which could have been used for other purposes and 
exposed the assets to further deterioration, but also deprived the agency of the 
potential income if disposed thru sale. 

 

In RSSO III, due to COVID-19 pandemic and the start of the 
implementation of the CY 2020 Census of Population and Housing (CPH) 
Project, Management was not able to act on the disposal of the unserviceable 
properties while in RSSOs VI and XIII, it was explained that due to the 
voluminous workload and the busy schedule of their personnel, they were not 
able to dispose the unserviceable PPEs.  

 
Likewise, in RSSO IVA, it was noted the continuous existence of 76 

unserviceable PPE in the total amount of P1.857 million and 26 unserviceable 
PPE with undetermined costs. The IIRUP for the said unserviceable PPE was 
not prepared by the Property Unit, thus disposal of the same was not conducted. 

   
The non-disposal of these unserviceable properties resulted in office 

space congestion, exposed the properties to further deterioration and deprived 
the agency of the potential income if the mode of disposal is thru sale. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the 

Chairperson, Disposal Committee of RSSOs III, VI and XIII to: (a) 

conduct inspection of unserviceable and disposable items and equipment; 



  

90 
 

and (b) cause the appraisal and immediate disposal of the reported 

unserviceable properties to avoid further deterioration. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the RD 

of RSSO IVA to direct the: 

 

a. Property Unit 
(i)  to coordinate with the Accounting and Property Unit to 

properly establish the costs/value of unserviceable 

equipment with undetermined costs/values;  

(ii) to prepare the IIRUP for the unserviceable PPEs and submit 
to the Disposal Committee; and 

 

b. Disposal Committee, to facilitate the process of the disposal of 
the unserviceable property. 

 
h. Discrepancies between the balance per books and balance per RPCPPE - 

P571.206 million 
 

Section 38, Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM for NGAs requires the 
conduct of a periodic physical count of PPE annually.  The result of the physical 
count is to be presented in the RPCPPE as at December 31 of each year which 
shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the 
following year.  Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the 
physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper 
accounting/recording. 

 
On the other hand, Section 63, Chapter 3 of PD 1445 provides that 

except as may otherwise be specifically provided by law or competent 
authority, all moneys and property officially received by a public officer in any 
capacity or upon any occasion must be accounted for as government funds and 
government property.  

 
Comparison between the PPE account balances per books against the 

RPCPPE as at December 31, 2020, in CO and RSSOs NCR, III, IVA and XI, 
disclosed a discrepancy of P571.206 million. Review of documents showed that 
the discrepancy could be attributed, among others, to the following: 

  
i. Beginning balances representing forwarded balances from NCSB and BAS 

- P52.099 million 
 

Verification of the SL balances of the PPE accounts disclosed that 
the amount of P52.099 million represented the amount of PPE from NCSB, 
NSO and BAS which were forwarded in PSA Books upon the creation of 
the PSA under RA No. 10625, otherwise known as the Philippine 
Statistical Act of 2013. 



  

91 
 

ii. PPE items reported in the RPCPPE but not recorded in the books – 
P227.813 million 

 
Reconciliation of the RPCPPE and the Schedule of PPE per SL 

account disclosed that the total amount of P227.813 million that were 
reported in the RPCPPE was not included in the PPE Schedule, as 
presented in Table 6.  

 
Table 6 - PPE Items Reported in the RPCPPE but not  

Recorded in the Books 
Office/RSSO         Amount

Total 227,812,599.06 

 
iii. PPE items recorded in the books but not reported in the RPCPPE -

P743.203 million   
 

Further reconciliation of the of the RPCPPE and the Schedule of 
PPE per SL account disclosed that the total amount of P743.203 million 
that were recorded in the books was not reported in the RPCPPE, as 
presented in Table 7. 

 
Table 7 - PPE Items Recorded in the Books but not 

Reported in the RPCPPE 
Office/RSSO      Amount (in P) 

CO 728,827,788.70 
NCR 219,700.00 
I 1,131,210.80 
III 855,111.50 
IVA 5,284,993.50 
VI 3,796,251.38 
XI 3,088,124.46 
Total 743,203,180.34 

 
  Interview with the Accounting Division personnel disclosed that one 
of the differences is due to the Building-East Avenue, which was recorded 
in the books but not included in the RPCPPE. The Accounting Division 
could not determine whether the said building referred to the former 
basketball court located in the East Avenue, which was destructed to give 
way to the construction of CVEA and TAM Building. 



  

92 
 

  In addition, the difference may also be attributed to the amount 
presented in the RPCPPE for CVEA Building. The Audit Team interviewed 
the Property Officer of the PSA-CO and disclosed that the cost of the CVEA 
building reported in the RPCPPE was based on the amount indicated in the 
As-Built Plan issued by the Department of the Building Official of Quezon 
City while the amount presented in the Schedule of PPE was based on the 
actual amount paid by the PSA in the construction of the said building.  The 
Property Officer further disclosed that a one-time cleansing/reconciliation 
of the PPE accounts will be conducted together with the Accounting 
Division including the RSSOs and PSOs personnel to resolve the issue. 

 
Likewise, in RSSO I, the discrepancy can be attributed to the 

missing/stolen vehicle valued at P162,413.83. According to the Supply 
Officer, he could no longer locate the Property Acknowledgement Receipt 
(PAR) pertaining to this vehicle and that he could not recall the year when 
it was lost. He further claimed that no request for relief from accountability 
was made.  

 
iv. Inclusion of semi-expendable items in the RPCPPE which should be 

presented in the RPCI - P0.512 million 
 

Likewise, review of the RPCPPE submitted to the Audit Team in 
PSA-CO disclosed that there were Office Equipment and Furniture and 
Fixtures costing P15,000.00 below that were included therein totaling to 
P0.512 million. The said Office Equipment and Furniture and Fixtures 
must be reported in the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) 
instead of RPCPPE since it was recorded as Semi-Expendable Machinery 
and Equipment.  

 
Due to the aforementioned deficiencies, the completeness, existence 

and accuracy of the PPE accounts with a net book value of P3.967 billion as at 
December 31, 2020 cannot be ascertained.  

 

We recommended that the Management instruct the Inventory 

Committees, Accounting Division and the Property Division of PSA-CO 

and RSSOs NCR, I, III, IVA, VI and XI: (a) to conduct reconciliation of 

their records considering the deficiencies noted in this report and adjust 

the affected accounts accordingly; and (b) thereafter, conduct regular 

reconciliation of their records to ensure that any discrepancies noted are 

verified and adjusted immediately. 
 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the: (a) 

Property Officer in PSA-CO to transfer the Semi-expendable Machinery 

and Equipment reported as PPE in the RPCPPE to RPCI; and (b) 

Designated Property Custodian in RSSO I to expedite the tracing of the 

PAR or Property Transfer Receipt (PTR) of the stolen/missing motor 



  

93 
 

vehicle, if any, and ensure that all procedures and reports regarding lost, 

missing, and transferred PPEs are undertaken and prepared.  

 
i. Non-derecognition of transferred ICT equipment from PSA-CO to RSSOs and 

PSOs - P594.444 million 
 

Section14, Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM for NGAs provides the 
entries in recording the Intra-Agency transfers of PPE from CO to Regional 
Offices/Staff Bureaus or vice versa. The transferred PPEs shall be recognized 
at the carrying amount of the asset received while the receiving 
department/office shall recognize the asset at its original historical cost less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss. 

 
In CY 2020, NEXTIX Inc. delivered 4,500 Laptop Type Biometric 

Registration Kits to be distributed to various RSSOs and PSOs in line with the 
implementation of the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) Project. The 
Registration kits were already transferred to various RSSOs and PSOs 
sometime in November and December 2020.  However, out of the 4,500 kits 
transferred to RSSOs and PSOs, 2,500 Registration Kits amounting to 
P594.444 million remained in the books of accounts of PSA-CO. 

 
Inquiry with the Accounting Division revealed that the transferred 

Registration Kits to the RSSOs and PSOs were not yet dropped from the books 
due to the absence of PAR signed by the Property Custodian in the RSSOs and 
PSOs.  The Property Officer also confirmed to the Audit Team that the signed 
PARs by the Property Custodian in RSSOs and PSOs were not completely 
submitted to the CO, thus, transferred ICT equipment were not yet dropped 
from the books. The Property Officer added that there was a problem 
encountered in issuing the PAR on the day when the Registration Kits were to 
be delivered to the PSOs. As of the date of this report, reconciliation was being 
conducted by the Property Officer and the Property Custodian in the PSOs to 
thresh out the problem encountered in the delivery of the Registration Kits. 

 
Further verification disclosed that the transferred ICT equipment to 

RSSOs and PSOs were not yet recorded in the books of RSSOs due to the 
absence of Journal Entry Vouchers and other supporting documents, 
derecognizing the of the ICT Equipment in the PSA-CO. Although, there was 
no effect in the consolidated amount of PPE accounts at year-end, however, the 
assumption of complete responsibility and accountability for these items must 
be ascertained so that in case of loss or negligence, accountable person/s may 
be easily determined. 

  
We recommended that Management require the: (a) Property 

Officer to: (i) follow up/monitor the submission of those unsubmitted PARs 

from the PSOs Property Custodians; and (ii) submit the PAR to the 

Accounting Division to derecognize the PPE transferred to the PSOs in the 



  

94 
 

books of accounts; and (b) OIC-Chief, Accounting Division to: (i) 

derecognize the PPE transferred to the RSSOs/POs upon the submission 

of PAR by the PO; and (ii) forward the JEVs prepared in the derecognition 

of transferred PPE to the Accountant of RSSOs as basis for recording the 

PPE received by PSOs. 

 
j. Incomplete supporting documents for the recognition of PPE and payable at 

month-end - P825.400 million 
 

Section 3, Chapter 10, Volume I of  GAM for NGAs states that the cost 
of an item of PPE shall be recognized as assets if, and only if: (a) it is probable 
that the future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item 
will flow to the entity; (b) the cost or fair value of the item can be measured 
reliably; (c) beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the government; 
(d) the asset is used to achieve government objectives; and (e) it meets the 
capitalization threshold of P15,000.00. 

 
Under this recognition principle, an entity shall evaluate all its PPE costs 

at the time they are incurred. These costs include cost incurred initially to 
acquire or construct an item of PPE and costs incurred subsequently to add to, 
replace part of, or service the PPE. 

 
Examination of the PPE accounts showed that the total amount of 

P824.794 million and P0.606 million was debited to Information 
Communication and Technology Equipment and Other Property, Plant and 
Equipment, respectively. The amounts were recognized by the Accounting 
Division in relation to the setting up of Accounts Payable every end of the 
month. However, examination of the JEVs for this transaction disclosed that 
there were no documents attached such as the IARs, SIs and DRs to support the 
completeness and accuracy of the amounts recorded in the books. Only the lists 
of obligated Accounts Payable were attached to the JEVs, hence, compromised 
the asserted rights and obligations of the entity and even the fundamental 
principle that claims against government funds shall be supported with 
complete documentation.  

 
According to the Accounting Division, the amounts set-up as payables 

were based on the amounts obligated by the Budget Division (BD) instead of 
the DRs or SIs attached to the IARs evidencing that the items or services were 
already delivered and inspected by the Inspection Officer.  The amount of 
Accounts Payable recognized in the books will not be equal to the amount 
obligated by the BD if the SIs or DRs attached to the IARs will be the basis in 
setting up the Accounts Payable as the IARs with DRs or SIs from General 
Service Division (GSD) were incomplete. This was confirmed in an interview 
with the Property Officer that IARs were not judiciously submitted to the 
Accounting Division.  The IARs will be submitted to the Accounting Division 



  

95 
 

only during the processing of DVs for the payment of the delivered goods and 
services.   
 

Under Appendix 62, Volume II of the GAM for NGAs, the IAR shall 
be prepared in four copies and the 3rd copy will be distributed to the Accounting 
Division which is an attachment to the JEV in setting up payables. Due to the 
absence of supporting documents in setting up the payable account, the 
accuracy of the amount recorded as PPE in the books of account becomes 
doubtful. 

 
We recommended and Management agreed to require the: (a) 

Chief, GSD to submit the IARs attached with SIs or DRs to Accounting 

Division whenever there were delivered goods and services as basis for the 

setting up of payables; and (b)  OIC-Chief, Accounting Division to: (i) stop 

the setting-up of payable account based on the amount obligated by the 

BD; and (ii) to set-up payable account based on the IAR attached with SI 

or DR from the GSD which will be attached to the JEV; and, (c) Chief, 

GSD and OIC-Chief, Accounting Division, to reconcile and monitor the 

compliance with the submission of IARs together with the SIs or DRs to 

the Accounting Division. 

 
k. Discrepancies between the balances of Inventory accounts per books and RPCI 

- P1.270 million  
 

Items A and C, Appendix 66, Volume II of the GAM for NGAs, 
provides that the RPCI is a form used to report the physical count of inventory 
items by type such as Office Supplies Inventory; Accountable Forms Inventory, 
Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Inventory; Food Supplies Inventory, 
etc. which are owned by the agency/entity.  It shall be prepared semi-annually 
by the Inventory Committee and by fund cluster. Item C of the same Appendix 
requires that the report shall be reconciled with the Supplies Ledger Cards 
(SLCs) and Stock Cards (SCs) maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit, 
and Property and/or Supply Division/Unit, respectively.  Any discrepancy shall 
be verified and/or adjusted accordingly. 

 
Comparison between the RPCI and the SLC balances of Inventory 

accounts as at December 31, 2020 revealed discrepancies in the total amount 
of P1.270 million, as presented in Table 8.

Total 1,043,723.65 2,313,953.45 1,270,229.80 



  

96 
 

It was explained that most of the difference in the inventory balances 
was due to non-recording of the issuances of supplies that were used in the 
CPH project as the required RSMIs to record the issuance of inventories in the 
books of accounts in the were not submitted by the Provincial Bookkeeper to 
the Accounting Division. 

 
Due to the above deficiency noted, the accuracy and existence of the 

Inventory account balances at year-end amounting to P191.630 million cannot 
be ascertained. 

 
We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, 

Statistical Officer of PSOs-Bulacan, Albay and Masbate to direct the 

Provincial Bookkeeper and Property Custodian to: (a) reconcile and 

determine the differences between supply and accounting records in order 

to establish the accuracy and completeness of the agency’s recorded 

inventories; and (b) effect necessary adjustments in the accounting and/or 

supply records after determining the differences of account balances. 

 
l. Unaccounted deposits and debit memos totaling to P3.544 million and 

P298,511.58 
 

Section 7, Chapter 5, Volume I of GAM for NGAs, states that revenue 
shall be recognized when it is probable that future economic benefits or service 
potential will flow to the entity and these benefits can be measured reliably. 

 
Moreover, Section 6, Chapter 21 of the same Manual also pointed out 

that the Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall prepare a JEV to recognize all 
reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the books of 
accounts. 

 

Analysis of the accounts, Cash in Bank – Local Currency Current 
Account and verification of the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) for CY 
2020 transactions showed that there were reconciling items reported in the BRS 
pertaining to prior years’ transactions that remained unadjusted as at year-end. 
As at December 31, 2020, deposits totaling P3.544 million in peso account 
representing the amount paid by various clients in securing services from the 
PSA in prior years remained unrecognized, while Debit Memos totaling 
P298,511.58 were also unrecognized at year-end.  

 
Upon inquiry with the Accountant in charge of the preparation of BRS, 

these items are still unrecorded in the books since these haven’t been verified 
and matched with the corresponding supporting documents. In particular, 
deposits to the current account for Office of Civil Registrar General (OCRG), 
in the amount of P1.162 million remained unadjusted since the Reports of 
Collections and Deposits (RCD) coming from the PSOs, have not been 
submitted to or received by the CO. 



  

97 
 

For unrecorded debit memos, the same delayed recognition can be noted 
since they are only recorded upon identification and verification with 
supporting documents. These unrecorded debit memos pertain to the period 
July 2017 to August 2018. 

 
 As of the date of this report, the Accounting Division is in close 

coordination with the LBP to secure pertinent documents particularly on the 
amount credited by bank of which the transactions cannot be identified by the 
Accounting Division. As a result, the Cash in Bank-Local Currency Current 
Account is understated by P3.245 million. 

 

We recommended that Management agreed to instruct the OIC-

Chief, Accounting Division to: (a) require the Cashier of the PSOs to 

regularly submit the RCD to the PSA-CO and identify the amount of 

unrecognized deposits based on the submitted RCD; (b) formally request 

from LBP the Debit Memos for the period July 2017 to August 2018; and 

(c) draw the necessary adjusting entries to correct the account balances, if 

warranted. 
 

m. Drawing of checks and recording of undelivered Office Supplies, PPE and 
semi-expendable items - P5.819 million  

 

Section 20, Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM for NGAs states that based 
on the IAR and other supporting documents, the Supply and/or Property 
Division/Unit shall prepare the DV and submit to the Accounting Division/Unit 
for the processing of payment.  

 
In RSSO VIII, evaluation of Inventories, PPE and Semi-Expendable 

Property accounts of PSOs, Southern Leyte and Biliran showed that the total 
amount of P5.819 million was recorded in the books of accounts.  Review of 
the said transactions disclosed that the Inventories, PPE and Semi-Expendable 
property were not yet delivered at year-end.  The Disbursement Voucher (DV) 
to support the recording of the transactions was approved by the Chief, 
Statistical Specialist without the IAR prepared by the designated Inspector to 
prove that the items procured was already delivered by the Supplier. Therefore, 
in the absence of IAR, the drawing of checks in payment for the subject items 
should not have been made by the Acting Accountant. Since the DV was 
already approved and the checks were already drawn, the transactions were also 
recognized in the books of accounts. 

 
The Acting Accountant disclosed that the preparation of DVs and 

drawings of checks were based on the Purchase Order (PO) and other 
accompanying supporting documents except for the IAR. Further, the release 
of the said checks drawn in payment to the supplier was made upon the delivery 
of the items, but the inspection and acceptance of the subject Inventories, PPEs 
and Semi-Expendable Property was done afterwards. 



  

98 
 

Due to the above practice, recording of the transactions in the books for 
the undelivered items will overstate the Inventories, PPE and Semi-Expendable 
Property accounts and understate the account Cash in Bank-Local Currency. 

 
We recommended and Management agreed to instruct: (a) the 

Chief, Statistical Specialist not to approve the vouchers without complete 

supporting documents, and (b) the Chief, Statistical Specialist to direct the 

Acting Accountant to stop the practice of drawing the checks and 

processing the DVs based on the PO and other supporting documents, 

instead processing of DVs will commence upon the submission of complete 

supporting documents which include the IAR to ascertain the propriety of 

the transaction being paid.  

 
 

Compliance Issues 

 
Non-/delayed submission of financial reports and documents  
 
3. Non-/delayed submission of financial reports and/or documents, such as paid 

DVs, TBs, FSs, JEVs, and BRSs and incomplete submission of documentary 

requirements for the DVs precluded the timely verification of financial 

accounts/transactions and communication of audit results to Management, 

among others. 

 

One of the standards to achieve fair presentation and reliable information of 
the FSs is timeliness in the preparation and submission of reports.  All needed reports 
should be provided promptly to be of maximum usefulness.   

 

COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 on the Rules and 
Regulations on Settlement of Accounts requires the Chief Accountant, bookkeeper 
or other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of 
the audited agency to ensure, among others, that the reports and supporting 
documents submitted by the accountable officers are immediately recorded in the 
books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first 10 days of the ensuing 
month.  

 
In RSSO III and BARMM, inventory of paid vouchers and checks issued and 

review of the Check Disbursements Journal (CDJs) and Report of Checks Issued 
(RCIs) for CY 2020 revealed that a total of 70 DVs, together with their supporting 
documents covering disbursements with an aggregate amount of P18.376 million, 
were not submitted to the Audit Team for evaluation and safekeeping, as presented 
in Table 9.

Likewise, review of the submitted reports and supporting documents revealed 

that the RSSOs III, IVB, V, VI and VII did not submit within the prescribed deadlines 
the required financial reports and documents with delays ranging from 1 to 373 days, 
as presented in Table 10.

The delayed submission of financial reports/statements, JEVs and supporting 

documents did not enable the timely review by the Audit Teams of the financial 
operations, the performance of the appropriate audit procedures necessary under the 
circumstances and the timely communication of audit results to Management. 

 
On the other hand, DVs totaling P322.253 million in RSSOs III, VIII, XI and 

BARMM were processed and paid without sufficient documentation, contrary to 
pertinent provisions of Section 4 of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001 
dated June 14, 2012, thus validity and propriety of the transactions could not be 
ascertained. 

 
We recommended and Management agreed to direct the:  (a)  Chief, 

Statistical Officers of the PSO-Bataan, PSO-Zambales and BARMM to require 

the Provincial Disbursing Officers and Bookkeepers to submit immediately to 

the Audit Team the DVs, JEVs and their supporting documents; and, (b)   

Accountant and Provincial Bookkeepers, RSSOs III, IVB, V, VI and VII, to 

improve on the submission of the required financial reports, JEVs and 

supporting documents to reduce the delays in their submission to the Audit 

Teams. 
 

 



  

100 
 

Delayed submission of POs, contracts, IARs and supporting documents 
 

4. Copies of contracts/purchase orders (POs) and supporting documents were not 
submitted to the Office of the Auditor within five working days from 

execution/approval, precluding the timely performance of the appropriate audit 

procedures.  

 

Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 requires 
agencies or instrumentalities to furnish to the Auditor of the agency concerned a copy 
of the contract within five working days from the execution of the contract by the 
government or any of its subdivisions.  In addition, Section 3.1.2 of the same Circular 
also requires agencies or instrumentalities to furnish to the Auditor of the agency 
concerned a copy of any purchase order, irrespective of amount and each and every 
supporting document, shall within five working days from issuance thereof, be 
submitted to the Auditor concerned. Within the same period, the auditor shall review 
and point out to Management defects and/or deficiencies, if any. 

 
In RSSO VI, copies of perfected contracts were not submitted to the Audit 

Team within five working days upon approval/perfection.  Likewise, in RO I, during 
the audit of disbursements for CY 2020, it was noted that there were several 
procurements of goods made by the Agency, however, the copies of POs and their 
supporting documents were not submitted ahead as prescribed under the above-cited 
regulations. In effect, the Audit Teams were precluded from evaluating and checking 
the validity and legality of the transactions. 

 
Management in RSSO VI was not aware of the regulation that the copy of the 

contract must be submitted within five working days from execution of the contract 
to the Audit Team.  Further, in RSSO I, the delayed submission of the POs was due 
to the COVID-19 pandemic wherein the said RSSO was placed under the Enhanced 
Community Quarantine (ECQ) of which skeleton workforce was implemented.  

 
We recommended and Management agreed to require the Property 

Officers of RSSOs I and VI and other concerned personnel to ensure the 

submission to the Office of the Auditor of copies of contracts, POs, JOs, and all 

other agreements entered into by the Management within five days from 

contract perfection to be able to conduct a timely evaluation/review of items 

purchased and any defects/deficiencies noted thereon will be immediately 

communicated to the Management. 

 
 

Lapses in procurement activities 
 
5. Lapses in the conduct of procurement activities were noted such as non-posting 

of NOA in the PhilGEPS, emergency procured items amounting to P1.924 

million not listed under Bayanihan to Heal as Once Act (RA No. 11469) and 



  

101 
 

rates of bidding documents offered to bidders were more than the maximum 

rates set by the GPPB. 

 

Annex “H”, Section IV.L (2) of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and 
Regulations (RIRR) of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184, unless the contract involves and 
affects national security as determined by the Head of the Procuring Entity in 
accordance with  Section IV(D) of this Guideline, the Bids and Awards Committee 
(BAC), through its Secretariat, shall post the Notice of Award (NOA), Contract/PO, 
including the Notice to Proceed (NTP) if necessary, for information purposes, in the 
PhilGEPS website, the website of the Procuring Entity concerned, if available, and at 
any conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the premises of the Procuring 
Entity within 10 days from their issuance, except  for contracts with Approved Budget 
for the Contract (ABC) of P50,000.00 and below. 

 
Evaluation of the procurement activities in PSO-La Union, PSO-Ilocos Norte 

and RSSO IX disclosed the deficiencies in procurement activities, as presented in 
Table 11. 

 
                   Table 11 - Deficiencies in Procurement Activities 

RSSO/PSO Deficiencies 

PSOs-La Union and 
Ilocos Norte 
 

The NOAs for purchases with an ABC of P50,000.00 and above 
were not posted in the PhilGEPS within 10 days from issuance 
while the printed copy of NOA postings in the PhilGEPS website 
of PSO-Ilocos Norte were not attached to the DVs to prove 
compliance with posting requirement of NOA in the PhilGEPS 
within 10 days.  
 
The Management of PSOs La Union and Ilocos Norte commented 
that the personnel in charge of posting the NOA to PhilGEPS 
website experienced technical difficulty due to system 
maintenance. In addition, the overlapping of activities of the 
Agency such as the conduct of 3rd and 4th Level Trainings in CY  
2020 CPH and other statistical surveys caused the delay in posting 
of NOA in the PhilGEPS. 
 

RSSO IX a. Procurement of office supplies and materials totaling P1.924 
million for the CY 2020 CPH was done thru emergency 
procurement using the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act (RA No. 
11469) as basis for the procurement of  the said items. However, 
the items procured were not among those specified in RA No. 
11469; and 
 

b. Repeat Order under taken for the procurement of various 
supplies and materials in the total amount of P1.924 million was 
not in accordance with Section 51(d) of the 2016 RIRR of RA 
No. 9184 which provides that repeat orders shall not exceed 25 
per cent of the quantity of each item in the original contract. In 
order not to exceed the 25 per cent threshold, the goods under 
the original contract must be quantifiable, divisible; and 



  

102 
 

RSSO/PSO Deficiencies 

consisting of at least four units per item. Based on the 
recomputation made by the Audit Team, the Repeat Order of 
various supplies and materials ranges from 30 to 32 per cent, 
more than the 25 per cent threshold required in Section 51(d) of 
the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184.  
 

Management explained that the increase in the quantity of subject 
goods procured for the conduct of the CY 2020 CPH stemmed from 
the change of schedule due to COVID-19. It was originally 
scheduled to be conducted in May 2021 by the Department of 
Education teachers, but was moved to September 2021. The 
teachers can no longer render their services, thus, census 
enumerators were hired. Also, the enumerators increased in number 
in order to cover wider areas for a shorter period of time and to 
lessen their exposure. Trainers were likewise augmented to limit 20 
participants per training in observance of social distancing. Hence, 
the quantity of CY 2020 CPH materials/supplies originally 
procured was insufficient, and the conduct of another bidding will 
no longer meet the timetable of the operation of the CY 2020 CPH. 
Management asserted that it is in the best interest of the government 
that activities related to the CY 2020 CPH, which will provide data 
that will help mitigate, if not contain, the transmission of COVID-
19, falls under the scope of RA No. 11469 or the Bayanihan Act. 
Nevertheless, the Management took notice of the recommendation 
that the BAC exercise caution in resolving and conducting 
alternative modes of procurement and will make a careful study of 
the many but distinct and updated rules and regulations of 
procurement. 

 
RSSO XI a. Cost of the bidding documents fee that the BAC set for the 

acquisition of the bidding documents was more than the 
maximum standard rates set by the GPPB, thereby defeating the 
purpose of encouraging market participation and competition.  
The total ABC for the seven lot for the procurement of supplies 
and materials was P15.060 million. Based on the GPPB 
Resolution No. 04-2012 dated February 24, 2012, the ABC 
ranging from P10.000 million to P50.000 million, the maximum 
cost of the bidding documents must be P25,000.00. Verification 
of the bidding documents disclosed that the total amount of 
P35,000.00 was set for the sale of bidding documents for the 
procurement of supplies and materials instead of P25,000.00 set 
in the GPPB Resolution No. 04-2012.    

 
b. Non-deduction of retention money equivalent to 10 per cent of 

P8.040 million or P0.804 million as warranty provided in the 
contract. Review of the bidding documents and the contract for 
the procurement of supplies for the conduct of 2020 Census of 
Population disclosed that the 10 per cent of the amount of each 
payment was to be retained by the Procuring Entity to cover the 



  

103 
 

RSSO/PSO Deficiencies 

Supplier’s warranty obligations. Verification of the 
disbursements for the payment of the contract to the supplier 
disclosed that the retention fee was not deducted, thus exposing 
the agency to risk of non-recovery of damages in case there was 
a defect in the delivery of the supplies and materials.   
 
Management admitted that it is not deducting retention money 
from payments to suppliers with procurement through Public 
Biddings for it thought that the Performance/Surety Bonds 
placed by the supplier would suffice. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the RDs of: 

 

a) RSSO I to direct the BAC to post in the PhilGEPS website NOAs within 10 
days from issuance, for information and transparency purposes in the 

procurement process of the Agency in compliance with the rules and 

regulations provided under RIRR of RA No. 9184; 

 

b) RSSO IX to require the BAC to exercise caution in resolving and conducting 

alternative methods of procurement. Make careful study of the many but 

distinct and updated rules and regulations on procurement during this 

pandemic period to be able to adopt the proper procurement law; and  
 

c) RSSO XI to: 
 

i. Require its BAC to set a lower bidding documents fee in the conduct of 
public bidding to encourage more participation from the prospective 

bidders;  

 

ii. Ensure that the contract terms and conditions are implemented; and 
 

iii. Encourage the personnel involved in the procurement process to attend 
seminars conducted by GPPB to address the continuing education 

needed to enhance their capacity.  

 
 

Inadequate maintenance of PPE records 
 

6. Inadequate maintenance of PPE records, and non-preparation and issuance of 
PARs did not provide check and balance between the property and accounting 

records/reports and evidence for accountability for issued PPE. 

 
Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM for NGAs requires the Chief 

Accountant to maintain the PPE Ledger Cards (PPELC) for each category of PPE. 
For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain 



  

104 
 

Property Cards (PCs) for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and 
disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC 
maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit and with other property records like the 
PAR.  

 
Under Appendix 71, Volume II of GAM for NGAs provides that the PAR 

shall be used in the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to record the issuance of 
PPE to end-user and it shall be renewed every three years or every time there is a 
change in custodianship/user of the property.  Likewise, Appendix 76 provides that 
the PTR shall be used when there are transfers of property from an Accountable 
Officer/Agency/Fund Cluster to another Accountable Officer/Agency/ Fund Cluster.  
Since the Registration Kits will be distributed to the end-users in the RSSOs and 
PSOs, the Property Officer of the PSA-CO should prepare the PTR instead of PAR 
while the PAR will be prepared by the Property Custodian in the PSOs when the 
Registration Kits are distributed to the end-users. 

 
In PSA-CO, review of property records/documents for the transfer of ICT 

Equipment to the RSSOs and PSOs disclosed that the Property Officer prepared the 
PAR instead of the PTR. Since the transferred PPE will be issued to end-users in the 
RSSOs and PSOs, the PTR should be issued to the Property Custodian of different 
RSSOs and PSOs and the Property Custodian will prepare the PAR once the 
transferred PPEs were issued to the end-users. 

 
Likewise, in RSSO IVA, review of the property records in PSOs-Laguna and 

Rizal disclosed that the PARs and PCs were not complete and updated. In PSO-
Quezon, the Property Officer was not able to cancel 15 PARs for items that were 
already disposed in CYs 2018 and 2019.  

 
In RSSO VI and VII, PPELC and PCs were not also updated.  Since the 

records were not updated, lapsing schedules to support the amount of Depreciation 
Expense and Accumulated Depreciation were not maintained. Hence, the correctness 
of the amount of Depreciation Expense and Accumulated Depreciation cannot be 
determined. Further evaluation of the property records in RSSO VII disclosed that 
the PTRs and PARs were not prepared and issued by the Property Officer/Custodian 
in transferring the PPEs from RSSOs to PSOs. As a result, accountability to the 
transferred PPEs cannot be established. 

 
Management informed that the PCs for PPEs procured in CY 2020 were 

updated. Only the PCs for PPEs acquired prior to CY 2020 were not updated as there 
was no proper turnover done by the previous Property Custodian.  

 
We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a) Property Officer of PSA-CO to issue PTR instead of PAR whenever there 
is transfer of PPE from CO to RSSOs/PSOs; 

 



  

105 
 

b) Chief, Statistical Officer of PSO-Laguna and Rizal to direct the Provincial 
Property Custodian to prepare and issue PTR/PAR for all PPE transferred 

or issued to end-users and to maintain records thereof for reconciliation 

with the PCs and accounting records;  

 

c) Chief, Statistical Officer of PSO-Quezon to require the Property Custodian 
to cancelled the 15 for items that were already disposed in CYs 2018 and 

2019; and  
 

d) RDs of RSSOs IVA, VI and VII to require: 
 

i. The Property Officer to maintain an updated PARs and PCs to 
determine the whereabouts of PPEs and accountability for transferred 

PPE to end-users; and 

 

ii. The Accountant to update the PPELCs as basis for the preparation of 
lapsing schedules to support the amount of Depreciation and 

Accumulated Depreciation recorded in the books of accounts. 

 
 

Deficiencies in inventory records maintenance and reporting 
 

7. Non-preparation and inadequate maintenance of inventory records and reports 
did not ensure completeness of the recording of inventory transactions and 

hampered the conduct of the necessary reconciliation of the supply and 

accounting records.  

    

Section 17, Chapter 8, Volume I of GAM for NGAs prescribes the 
preparation/maintenance of the RSMI and Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) by the 
Property and/or Supply Custodian, SLC by the Accounting Division/Unit and the 
RPCI by the Inventory Committee. 

 
Verification of the forms, records and reports prepared and maintained by the 

RSSO- IVB disclosed that the ICSs for semi-expendable property issued were not 
prepared by the Supply Officer.  It was also noted that the SCs for each type of 
supplies in RSSO III were not updated while the SCs for semi-expendable property 
in RSSO IV-A were not maintained by the Property Section.   

 
On the other hand, in RSSOs III, IVA and XI, the RSMI is not being prepared.  

There were no information on the fund cluster, serial number, date, Requisition and 
Issue Slip (RIS) No., Responsibility Center Code, and Stock No. in the RIS issued 
by the Supply Officers.  

 
With the non-preparation and/ or maintenance of the required records and 

reports for inventory items, the inventory transactions were not completely recorded 
and reported, the monitoring and recording of inventory items were not facilitated; 



  

106 
 

and the conduct of the necessary reconciliation of the supply and accounting records 
could not be undertaken.   

 
We recommended and Management agreed to require the Supply 

Officers of:  (a) RSSO IVB to prepare and maintain the ICS for the issuance to 

end-users of tangible items amounting to less than P15,000.00 to establish 

accountability for the said items; (b) RSSOs III and IVA to maintain and update 

the SCs for each type of supplies and semi-expendable property to record all 

receipts and issued made regardless of sources and/or modes of acquisition; and 

(c) RSSOs III, IVA and XI, to prepare the RSMI duly supported by the RIS to 

report/summarize all issues of inventories that would be the basis of the 

Accounting Division for the preparation of JEV.  

 

 

Deficiencies in the liquidation of cash advances (CAs) 
 

8. Cash advances amounting to P36.336 million were not fully liquidated at the end 
of the year, and excess CAs totaling P157,446.01 were not refunded prior to the 

submission of the liquidation reports as required under Section 2 of COA 

Circular No. 2012-004 resulting in partial liquidation of CAs, and the recording 

of expenses in the succeeding year instead of the current year of which the 
expenses relate.  

Section 2 of COA Circular No. 2012-004 dated November 28, 2012 explains 
that a CA is settled and liquidated either by returning the money advanced if unspent, 
or by the presentation of regularly accomplished vouchers, giving satisfactory detail 
of the items thereon paid which must be in accordance with the purpose for which the 
CA was granted, and further supported by proper receipts and other evidence of 
payments, subject to the result of the post-audit thereof by the auditor concerned. 
Also, Section 5.8 of the same Circular provides that all CAs shall be fully liquidated 
at the end of each year except for petty cash fund, the Accountable Officer shall refund 
any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the 
necessary OR. 

 
Likewise, Section 4.1.3 of COA Circular 97-002 dated February 10, 997 

states that a cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the purpose for which it was 
given has been served. Section 5.1.3 of the same Circular further states that 
liquidation of cash advance for foreign travel must be liquidated within sixty (60) 
days after return to the Philippines. 

 
In the review of the liquidation reports and documents for CAs, we noted the 

following: 
 

a. Excess CAs totaling P157,446.01 were not refunded prior to the submission 
of the liquidation reports. 

 
In PSA-CO, review of the liquidation reports of the Special Disbursing 



  

107 
 

Officer (SDOs) and Accountable Officers showed that refunds of excess CAs 
totaling P157,446.01 were not returned before the liquidation reports were 
submitted to the Accounting Division.  Refunds of excess CAs were made after 3 
to 33 working days from the submission of the corresponding liquidation reports to 
the Accounting Division. 

 
As disclosed by the Accounting Division, upon submission of the 

liquidation report to the Accounting Division, it reviews first the liquidation 
documents before preparing the Order of Payment (OP) for the refund of any 
unutilized balance of the CA. Even if a CA balance is available for refund, the SDO 
has to wait for the Accounting Division to determine the balance for refund and 
issue the OP which will be the basis for the refund to be made by the SDO. Since 
the Accounting Division reviews the liquidation documents prior to the refund of 
any excess CAs, the CAs appear to be partially liquidated as of the date of 
submission by the SDO of the liquidation reports. The excess CAs were also 
exposed to the risk of loss or misappropriation while the same have not been 
refunded by the SDO.  

 
b. CAs amounting to P36.336 million were not fully liquidated at the end of 

the year.  
 

Likewise, in PSA-CO and RSSO VII, review of the liquidation reports and 
documents for various CAs granted to SDOs disclosed that CAs amounting to 
P0.775 million were not fully liquidated at the end of the year. Interview with the 
designated SDO of PSA disclosed that she is not aware of the said provision that 
the CA granted to her should be liquidated before year-end.  

 
Moreover, in PSO-CO, RSSOs VII and XII, the CAs granted in CY 2020 

included special CAs totaling P35.561 million which were liquidated between two 
to 123 days (excluding the ECQ and modified ECQ (MECQ) days) after the 
purpose for which these were given have been served. On the other hand, the CA 
for foreign travel was liquidated 153 days after the return of the Accountable 
Officer to the Philippines. These instances were contrary to Sections 4.1.3 and 5.1.3 
of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 which require that the CA 
shall be reported as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served and 
within 60 days after return to the Philippines in the case of foreign travel. 
  
 Inquiry disclosed that the OIC-Chief Accountant in PSA-CO reminded the 
Accountable Officers concerned through issuance of numerous demand letters for 
the settlement of their accountabilities. However, despite the reminder, the 
Accountable Officers did not prioritize the liquidation of their CAs. 
 
 The PSA issued Office Memorandum No. 2017-042 dated March 20, 2017 
prescribing the guidelines in managing petty cash fund and special CAs.  It was 
provided in Section 3.5(B)(1) that the SDO shall liquidate and submit the required 
documents to the Accounting Division at least 15 days after the purpose has been 



  

108 
 

served, thus the SDOs liquidate the CAs granted to them at least 15 days after the 
purpose has been served. Further, there were no provisions in the said Office 
Memorandum regarding sanctions for those SDOs who failed to liquidate the CAs 
granted despite of the numerous demand letters issued by the Accounting Division 
to the SDOs. 
 

Due to the late submission of the liquidation report by the SDOs/AOs and 
non-liquidation of CAs at year-end, the expenses pertaining to the activity 
conducted of which the CAs have been granted were recorded in the succeeding 
year, instead of the current year of which the expenses relate. 

 
  We recommended that the Management require: 
 

a) All officers and employees granted CAs to immediately liquidate their CAs 
within the prescribed period and before the year-end for the timely 

recording of the related travel expenses and refund of CAs, if any, in the 

books;  

 

b) The SDOs to refund any excess CA prior to the submission of liquidation 
report, with the OR for such refund forming part of the liquidation 

documents; and 

 

c) The OIC-Chief, Accountant to: (i) accept liquidation reports of CAs only 
if excess CAs have been refunded and the OR/s thereon support the said 

report; (ii) issue a memorandum requiring the SDOs to liquidate their 

unliquidated CAs before year-end; and (iii) draw the necessary adjusting 

entries to correct the balances of affected accounts. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to direct the OIC-

Chief, Accountant to: (i) revise Section 5(B)(1) of Office Memorandum No. 

2017-042 that instead of “at least 15 days from after the purpose has been 

served” to “within 15 days after the purpose has been served”; and (ii) include 

sanction as stated in Section 5.1.3 of COA Circular No. 97-002 which is to 

withhold the salary of the SDOs who failed to liquidate the special CAs within 

the prescribed period.  

 

Management comments: 

 
Management agreed to the recommendations, however, the Accounting 

Division commented that it will verify first the amounts to avoid 
over/underpayment of refund, instead of requiring the SDOs to refund any excess 
CA before the submission of liquidation report with the OR attached as part of 
supporting documents. 
 
 
 



  

109 
 

Auditor’s rejoinder: 
 

The Audit Team has observed that it took number of days to complete the 
review and verification of the liquidation reports and before the excess CA will be 
refunded which affects the timely recognition of expenses in the books of accounts. 
Hence, it is recommended that the excess CA must be refunded first and the OR/s 
for such refund be part of the liquidation documents.  Any over/underpayment can 
be set up as Due from/Due to Officers and Employees and can be deducted from 
his/her salary. 

 
Other Issues 

 

Overpayment of Rent 
 
9. Overpayment of rental expenses amounting to P229,500.00 due to the 10 per cent 

increase in office rent indicated in the Contract of Lease for CYs 2019 and 2020 

which is not in accordance with RA No. 9184, thereby, rendering the contract 

unfavorable and disadvantageous to the government.  

 

  In RSSO VI, review of the relevant documents in connection with the 
procurement of “One Year Lease Contract for Office Space of Philippine Statistics 
Authority Antique Provincial Statistical Service Office located at San Jose, Antique” 
which include the Bid Documents, the Contract Agreement, and the Feasibility Study, 
revealed that Clause H of the Invitation to Submit Proposal provides that “The 
Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC) is P1,320,000.00 or P220.00 per sq.m. (per 
month) with no rental increase on the first five years and a 5 per cent escalation rate 
per year thereafter.”  

 

  Likewise, in the CY 2016 Feasibility Study, specifically in the Comparative 
Analysis (Qualitative) and Cost Analysis (Prevailing Rental Costs), it outlined that 
the Eagle’s Place is the best option for the PSO Antique because, among other factors, 
“rent increase will commence on the sixth year” unlike in other locations, where 10 
per cent increase in rent shall be imposed as often as “every year”.  

 

  Moreover, as can be gleaned from the ABC, the Project Title, Clause 12 of 
the Instruction to Bidders, and Clause 7 of the General Conditions of Contract, and 
Sample Rental Contract, all of which form part of the Lease Contract; the 
procurement was for one year only, renewable yearly, but without any provision for 
an increase in rental rate upon renewal. 

 

  It is worthy to note that Section 61 of RA No. 9184 and Item 61.1 of the 
2016 RIRR “For the given scope of work in the contract as awarded, all bid prices 
shall be considered as fixed prices, and therefore not subject to price escalation during 
contract implementation, except under extraordinary circumstances and upon prior 
approval of the GPPB xxx.” 



  

110 
 

  Considering the above discussions, it is clear that the Contract of Lease 
dated December 12, 2016, departed substantially from the Sample Rental Contract, 
as well as the other documents, forming part of the lease contract when the term of 
the lease was changed from one year to five years, and imposed a 10 per cent increase 
in the rental rate in the 3rd year instead of the allowed 5 per cent increase on the 6th 
year. Examination and recomputation of the rental payment made in CYs 2019 and 
2020 disclosed that there was an overpayment in the amount of P229,500.00, as 
shown in Table 12.  

 

  Table 12 - Details of the Overpayment of Rent to Eagle’s Place (in P) 
Period  Per DV Per Audit Overpayment 

ND # 2019-02-(2019)          19,125.00 
March – December 2019     879,750.00    784,125.00 95,625.00 
January – December 2020 1,262,250.00 1,147,500.00 114,750.00 
Total 2,142,000.00 1,931,625.00 229,500.00 

 

We recommended that Management: (a) revert the monthly rent to the 

original rate of P105,000.00 or annual rate of P1.260 million, as laid out in the 

NOA; (b) require the refund of the overpayment totaling P229,500.00; and (c) 

follow strictly the conditions embodied in Clause H of the Invitation to Submit 

Proposal, Clause 12 of the Instruction to Bidders and Clause 7 of the General 

Conditions of Contract. 

 
Management comments: 

 
After careful review of the feasibility study and bidding documents, the lease 

of contract was indeed in contrary to the provisions stated therein. It may have 
overlooked this during the preparation of the lease contract but emphasized that there 
was no intention of giving undue privilege to the owner of the rented building. With 
regard to the 10 per cent increase that started in January 2019, the Management 
requested for the reconsideration of the recommendation to refund the overpayment 
of P229,500.00. 

 

Auditor’s rejoinder:  

 

Since the increase in rent rendered the contract unfavorable and 
disadvantageous   to the government, we stand by our recommendation on the 
reversion of the monthly rent to the original rate of P105,000.00. Moreover, as 
National Government Sector Cluster 2 Decision No. 2020-13 dated September 8, 
2020 directed the Audit Team to issue the corresponding supplemental and/or 
additional Notice of Disallowance to cover the undue payment/s of  P210,375.00, 
then such should be complied by the Audit Team.

Accommodation of expenses in relation to the CRS operation managed by Unisys 

 

10. The agency incurred additional expenses totaling to P2.495 million in CYs 2019 
and 2020, for accommodating the payment of operational expenses incurred by 

Unisys despite the provision in the concession agreement that it will assume all 

costs related to the operations and maintenance of the CRS which resulted in 

the unpaid obligation of Unisys to PSA amounting to P2.115 million, depriving 

the agency of using the amount to finance its programs/ projects and activities.  
  

Item 4.4.4 of the Concession Agreement dated September 30, 2016 states that 
the Concessionaire shall assume all cost related to the operations and maintenance of 
CRS-ITP, including payment of all rent, taxes and other fees pertaining to CRS-ITP.  

 
Section 4 Paragraph 2 of PD No. 1445 states that “Government funds or 

property shall be spent or used solely for public purposes”. 
 
The Unisys is holding its office in the building rented by RSSO II from the 

Local Government Unit (LGU). Verification of the Audit Team revealed that RSSO 
II and Unisys had their respective rental contract with the LGU of Tuguegarao. In 
addition, a separate electric meter was also installed in the CRS Office last July 2020.  
However, the RSSO II accommodated the payment of rental from January to 
December 2020 and the electric bills consumed from July to December 2020 totaling 
to P1.277 million despite of the separate contract between the PSA and CRS with the 
LGU of Tuguegarao and the Cagayan Electric Cooperative (CAGELCO). The said 
amount was taken from the regular fund allotted to RSSO II, which deprived the 
agency of using the amount to finance its programs/projects and activities.  

 
Likewise, it was noted that in CY 2019, RSSO II also accommodated the 

payment of operating expenses incurred by Unisys totaling to P1.218 million. Out of 
the total amount accommodated, only P379,616.29 representing the monthly dues 
from January to June 2019 was remitted by Unisys to PSA-CO leaving an unpaid 
obligation of Unisys to PSA in the amount of P2.115 million. 

 
Interview with the Accounting Division of the PSA-CO disclosed that it was 

the practice of the PSA that the payment of operational expenses incurred by Unisys 
was being accommodated by the Agency and will be refunded to Unisys by sending 
a billing statement indicating the operational expenses accommodated by the PSA 
for a particular period.  It was also disclosed that the operational expenses of Unisys 
accommodated by PSA in CY 2020 amounting to P62.237 million was already paid 
in July 12, 2021.  However, the documents for such transaction were not yet received 
by the Audit Team to facilitate the validation of the accuracy of the amount paid by 
Unisys. For CY 2019 operational expenses, the PSA and Unisys had an ongoing 
reconciliation of the amount accommodated by PSA and the billing statement will be 
forwarded to Unisys once the both records were reconciled.   

 



  

112 
 

We reiterated our audit recommendation and Management agreed to 

direct the Regional Director of RSSO II to (i) require Unisys to refund the 

amount of P2.115 million, representing the unpaid obligation of Unisys in CY 

2019 and 2020 operational expenses accommodated by PSA; and (ii) stop the 
practice of accommodating the operating expenses of Unisys, instead advise the 

latter to pay directly their monthly office space rental to the LGU of Tuguegarao 

City and electricity bill to the CAGELCO. 

 
 

Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts/Areas 

 

11. COVID-19 Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 
  

For CY 2020, the PSA had not received funds specifically for COVID-19 
response and/or recovery but had utilized its budget for related expenses. 

 
The COVID-19 related expenses charged to Personnel Services and 

Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) for PSA-CO totaled P1.479 
million and P194.585 million, respectively. The results of audit of those COVID-
related transactions are as follows: 

 
On the provision of supplies/materials for hazard control 
 

Paragraph B, Section VI of Administrative Order (AO) No. 2020-0015 DOH 
on Risk-based Public Health Standards Across Settings provides that at the minimum, 
all actors shall implement the prescribed interventions in various settings as presented 
under Annex A-Required Public Health Standards Across All Settings as of April 27, 
2020, depending on their Risk Severity Grading. For each prescribed intervention, 
concrete examples of corresponding hazard controls (i.e. engineering control, 
administrative control, and Personal Protective Equipment) are provided.  Column 
D-Offices/Workplaces of Annex A listed the administrative controls and Personal 
Protective Equipment for offices/workplaces, such as provision of tissue, masks, 
among others.  On the other hand, engineering and administrative controls include 
placement of handwashing facilities, hand sanitizers and dispensers with alcohol-
based in all entrances, exits and areas with high foot traffic and facilities. 
  

Review of financial transactions for CY 2020 disclosed various procurements 
from the Procurement Service and other suppliers of other supplies in response to 
COVID-19 pandemic, to include surgical face mask, hand wash and medicines on 
top of the regular supplies given such as tissue and alcohol. In PSA-CO, the total 
supplies in response to COVID-19 given to officers and employees amounted to 
P5.220 million. In addition, the total amount of P178.281 million was transferred to 
Philippine Pharma Procurement Inc., for the purchase of surgical face mask and 
alcohol for distribution to the 150,000 Enumerators and Supervisors hired by the PSA 
in the conduct of the CY 2020 CPH.  
 



  

113 
 

Likewise, the PSA-CO also transferred funds to the Philippine Red Cross 
(PRC) totaling P0.828 million for the payment of Reverse Transcription Polymerase 
Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test for the 132 PSA employees who had symptoms and 
direct contact with COVID-19 positive employees.   
 
On the provision of transportation facilities to employees on skeleton workforce 

 
Item C, Section 4.0 of Civil Service Commission (CSC) MC No. 18, s. 2020 

requires that reasonable transportation facilities and housing quarters shall be 
provided to employees assigned as skeleton workforce, whenever practicable, and 
subject to budgeting, accounting and auditing rules and regulations. 

 
The PSA-CO entered into an emergency procurement for the rental of motor 

vehicle in CY 2020 to transport personnel on skeleton workforce, which as at year-
end had a total cost of P5.804 million.  

 

        On the grant of hazard pay to employees during the ECQ 
 
Hazard pay amounting to P449,500.00 was paid to RSSO IVB personnel who 

were not authorized to report for work during the period of implementation of 

ECQ while PSO-Lanao Del Norte paid hazard pay of P29,500.00 which was 

beyond the period when Iligan City was placed under ECQ, contrary to Section 

2 of AO No. 26 dated March 23, 2020, resulting in additional expenses to PSA. 

 
Section 1 of AO No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 of the Office of the President 

authorized the NGAs to grant COVID-19 hazard pay to personnel who physically 
reported for work during the implementation of ECQ in their respective work 
stations, in an amount not exceeding P500.00 per day per person.  

 
Section 2 of the same AO provides the conditions on the grant of the COVID-

19 hazard pay and that the heads of government agencies may grant the COVID-19 
hazard pay to their personnel/workers without the need for further approval by the 
DBM, subject to the following guidelines and conditions: 

 
1. The personnel are occupying regular, contractual or casual positions, or 

are workers engaged through contract of service (COS), job order (JO), 
or other similar schemes. 
 

2. The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for 
work at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official 
working hours by the head of agency/office during the period of 
implementation of ECQ measures in the area of such office or work 
station. 
 

3. The total rate of the COVID 19 hazard pay shall be based on the number 
of days an employee/worker physically reports for work during the ECQ 



  

114 
 

period using the formula under Section 1, which is P500.00 x No. of days 
physically reporting for work during the quarantine period. 

 
In PSA CO, review of the transactions recognized under Hazard Pay and 

Other General Services for CY 2020 disclosed that the PSA granted COVID-19 
hazard pay to regular employees and JO personnel at P500.00 per day totaling 
P1.479 million and P4.452 million, respectively, who reported to office during the 
ECQ (March 17 to May 15, 2020) and MECQ (May 16 to 31, 2020 and August 4 
to 18, 2020). 

 
Verification of the DVs on the grant hazard pay showed that the payments 

were supported with office orders of the PSA employees and JO personnel, 
authorized to work during the ECQ and MECQ, Daily Time Records and list of 
personnel who rendered service during the community quarantine. 

 
On the other hand, in RSSO IVB, audit of the Hazard Pay DVs revealed that 

the RSSO IVB granted Hazard Pay to some of its officers and employees, including 
Contract of Service Workers, on days they reported to the office even without the 
prior approval of the RD as indicated in the issued Special Orders (SOs). There 
were also instances wherein officials and employees claimed Hazard Pay even if 
they were not included in the list of skeletal workforce of the RSSO IVB during the 
period of implementation of ECQ measures. The total amount of unauthorized 
Hazard Pay claimed by various employees who reported for work but not included 
in the SO amounted to P449,500.00. 

 

Likewise, in PSO-Lanao Del Norte, hazard pay claimed and paid to various 
employees who worked during the ECQ includes an aggregate amount of 
P29,500.00 that was beyond the period when Iligan City was placed under ECQ.   

 

As a result, the PSA has incurred additional expenses in view of such 
unauthorized and excessive expenses. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 
 

a) RD of RSSO IVB to provide a reasonable explanation to justify the claim 
of Hazard Pay of officials and employees who were not included in the 

authorized list and those who claimed on days when they were not officially 

part of the skeletal work force, if not, cause the immediate refund of the 

unauthorized claim for Hazard Pay; and 

 

b) Chief Statistical Officer of PSO-Lanao Del Norte to instruct the concerned 
payees/claimants to refund the excess, and unauthorized hazard pay. 

 

  
 
 
 



  

115 
 

Gender and Development (GAD)  

 

12. The PSA-CO did not submit the duly approved CY 2020 GPB and its 
corresponding AR for CY 2020, precluding review and validation of GAD-

related activities by the Audit Team. 

 

Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 states that 
government agencies are required to submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and 
Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit Team assigned to the agency within five working 
days from the receipt of the approved plan from the Philippine Commission on Women 
(PCW) or their mother or COs, as the case maybe.  Likewise, a copy of the 
corresponding Accomplishment Report (AR) shall be furnished the said Audit Team 
within five working days from the end of January of the preceding year. 

 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the PCW issued MC No. 2021-01 dated 

January 20, 2021 indicating the deadline of encoding and submission to PCW of FY 
2020 GAD ARs for executive departments and their attached agencies through the 
PCW Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) which should be on or 
before March 12, 2021. 

 
The Audit Team, in its letter dated February 24, 2021, requested the submission 

of the GPB and corresponding AR for FY 2020. Aside from the issued letter, several 
verbal communications were done to require the submission of the GPB and AR. 
Interview with the concerned staff disclosed that they were delayed in the process of 
consolidating the AR of RSSOs due to the COVID-19 pandemic of which the RSSOs 
had implemented skeleton workforce arrangement for the safety of the employees.  

 
Despite follow-up by the Audit Team for the submission of the GPB, it was 

only on June 16, 2021 that the consolidated required ARs were submitted to the Audit 
Team. Validation of the AR submitted showed that there were reporting deficiencies 
in the AR and unaccomplished GAD-activities had not supported the government’s 
effort, among others, in the protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human 
right, and the practice of gender responsive governance, and had not ensured accurate 
reporting on GAD.  

 
The consolidated report of the GPB and the AR for FY 2020 submitted to the 

Audit Team showed that a total of 87 activities with a total budget of P213.328 million 
were planned to be implemented by the PSA. Examination of the AR showed that out 
of the 87 activities to be implemented, 41 or 47 per cent of the planned activities were 
implemented with a total cost of P123.905 million. Out of the 41 implemented 
activities, the actual result/output for the 31 or 76 per cent of the activities 
implemented amounting to P122.894 million were indicated in the AR while the actual 
results/output of the 10 activities with corresponding actual cost of P1.010 million 
were not indicated. Likewise, the remaining 46 activities with a total budget of 
P21.734 million were not implemented as at December 31, 2020. 

 



  

116 
 

Management commented that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, majority of the 
planned activities were not implemented. 

 
We recommended and Management agreed to require the GAD Focal 

Person/Technical Working Group to: (a) ensure and strengthen the 

implementation of GAD related programs and activities, in accordance with the 

approved GPB; (b) indicate the actual results/output in every activity that was 

implemented; and (c) submit within the prescribed period the GAD AR for 

timely audit and verification by the Audit Team. 

 

 

13. Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs)  
 

Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020, requires that all 
agencies of the government formulate plans, programs, and projects intended to 
address the concerns of SCs and PWDs, insofar as it relates to their mandated 
functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities. 

 
The SCs, PWDs, and pregnant women are given priority in whatever concerns 

they have with the PSA. There are comfortable waiting areas provided to ensure their 
comfort while waiting for their turn to be served. Priority lane for SCs, PWDs and 
pregnant women was provided aside from priority assistance desk.  Also, wheel chair 
was readily available for clients and awareness forum on COVID-19 Health Protocols 
was conducted during the conduct of Step 2 PhilSys Registration.     

 
 

14. Youth Development Projects and Activities  
 
Section 33 of the General Provision of the GAA for FY 2020 requires that all 

agencies of the government provide allocations for youth development projects and 
activities, which shall include government internship opportunities within the 
framework of the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).  

 
With regard to programs related to youth, the PSA despite the COVID-19 

pandemic, conducted various programs and activities which focused on youth 
development and empowerment. The PSA-CO and RSSOs conducted activities such 
as issuance of Civil Registration Documents for first job seekers, accepting On-the 
Job trainees and three-day seminar on Effective Barangay and Sanggunian Kabataan 
Governance. During the Civil Registration Month, the PSA also conducted an online 
data dissemination forum, poster making contest and essay writing contest which was 
participated by various students nationwide. 

 
 
 
 



  

117 
 

15. Tax Laws and Regulations, GSIS and Pag-IBIG Premium Contributions and 
Loan Amortizations, and PhilHealth Premium Contributions 

 

For CY 2020, the PSA had faithfully deducted from the salaries of personnel 
the required taxes, premiums, contributions on personal share for Pag-IBIG and 
PhilHealth and social insurance contributions and remitted the same, as well as the 
government share within the prescribed period to the respective institutions or 
agencies. The summary is shown in Table 13.

GSIS Property Insurance Law 
 

16. Various physical assets and properties of RSSOs IVB and X in the total amount 
of P13.784 million were not insured with the GIF of the GSIS, thus exposed the 

RSSOs of not being indemnified or compensated  for any damage to, or loss of 

its property due to fire or any other force majeure.  

 
The PSA CO has continually complied with RA No. 656, otherwise known as 

the Property Insurance Law. All regions, except RSSOs IVB and X, were compliant 
with the Property Insurance Law.   

 
In RSSO IVB, various physical assets and properties with a total cost of P7.734 

million were not insured with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the Government 
Service Insurance Service (GSIS), while in RSSO X, out of the total cost of P29.770 
million insurable properties, only P23.719 were covered by insurance while the 
difference of P6.050 million remained uninsured, despite the issuances of Audit 
Observation Memorandum (AOM) in CYs 2018 and 2019. The non-compliance with 
the AOM was due to lack of personnel that will conduct the appraisal of the properties 
to be insured while in RSSO X, the renewal of property insurance coverage for the 
CY 2020 was overlooked due to COVID-19 pandemic.  

 
As a result, RSSOs IVB and X were exposed to the risk of not being 

indemnified or compensated for any damage to, or loss of its property due to fire or 
any other force majeure.

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Director of 

RSSO IVB and X to secure an insurance coverage for all insurable assets with 

the GIF of the GSIS in order to be indemnified or compensated in case of damage 

or loss and observe the guidelines set forth in COA Circular No. 2018-002. 
 

 

17. Hiring of Job Orders (JOs) and Contractual 
   

In order to supplement its manpower needs, the PSA hired 598 JO personnel 
for the PSA CO and 5,078 for the RSSOs, or a total of 5,676 JO personnel, the salaries 
of which were paid out of the regular fund. The increase of 4,987 JO personnel hired 
compared to CY 2019 JOs was due to the roll-out of PhilSys in CY 2020, in the 
absence of the plantilla positions approved by the DBM. 

 
 
18. Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges 
 

For CY 2020, Notices of Suspension and Disallowance (NSs/NDs) issued 
amounted to P3.990 million and P8,158.61, respectively, while there were no Notices 
of Charge (NCs) issued during the year. Notices of Settlement for Disallowances and 
Charges (NSSDCs) issued for settlements made amounted to P16.408 million. As at 
December 31, 2020, the status of NSs, NDs, and NCs is shown in Table 14.
