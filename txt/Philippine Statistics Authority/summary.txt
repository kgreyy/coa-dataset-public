EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

Republic Act (RA) No. 10625, otherwise known as the Philippine Statistical Act of 

2013, was signed into law on September 12, 2013. It merged the National Statistics 

Office (NSO), Bureau of Agricultural Statistics (BAS), National Statistical 

Coordination Board (NSCB), and the Bureau of Labor and Employment Statistics 

(BLES) into one agency named Philippine Statistical Authority or the PSA.  

 

The PSA shall be primarily responsible for the attainment of the objectives and 

provisions of RA No. 10625. It shall plan, develop, prescribe, disseminate, and 

enforce policies, rules, and regulations, and coordinate government-wide programs 

governing the production of official statistics, general purpose statistics, and civil 

registration services. It shall take charge of all national censuses and surveys, sectoral 

statistics, consolidation of selected administrative recording systems, and 

compilation of national accounts. It also serves as the central statistical authority on 

primary data collection in the Philippines. 

 

The PSA is headed by Mr. Claire Dennis S. Mapa, Ph.D, National Statistician and 

Civil Registrar General, and is assisted by three Deputy National Statisticians and 

eight Assistant National Statisticians.  The PSA has three support services, namely: 

(a) Sectoral Statistics Office; (b) Census and Technical Coordination Office; and (c) 

Civil Registration and Central Support Office, and each office is composed of

C. Scope and Objectives of Audit 
  

The audit covered the financial accounts and operations of the PSA for year ended 

December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of assurance 

that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements (FSs); 

(b) determine the propriety of transactions, as well as the extent of compliance with 

pertinent laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency’s improvement 

opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit 

recommendations. 

 

 

D. Audit Methodology 
  

We adopted a risk-based audit approach in the audit of the FSs of the PSA and in 

the review of compliance with laws, rules and regulations.  The Audit Team which 

carried out the audit, among others, (i) examined financial and accounting 

procedures adopted by the PSA and other relevant documentation; (ii) assessed 

internal controls regulating financial operations and carried out compliance testing 

for determining the extent of control in operation; (iii)  conducted substantive testing

of a representative sample of selected transactions; (iv) carried out review, on test 

check basis, of a number of contracts and transactions related to movements in 

balances of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses; and (v) conducted interviews 

and held discussions with the concerned officials and staff in the CO and ROs.  

 

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and the 

concerned officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda.

Among the audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in Part 

II of this report, the significant observations are summarized as follows: 

 

1. Various errors and omissions in the keeping of the accounts had affected the 
completeness and accuracy of account balances reported in the FSs. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned 

personnel of the Accounting Division and Accountants of Regional Statistical 

Services Offices (RSSOs) to prepare the necessary adjusting journal entries to 

correct the accounting errors/omissions; henceforth, observe the proper/correct 

recognition of accounts and transactions in accordance with the Government 

Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies and other applicable 

rules and regulations. 

 



 

iv 

 

2. A number of accounts were either misclassified, with unreconciled balances, 
and/or not properly documented, thus, accuracy, reliability and regularity of the 

same cannot be fully ascertained. 

 

a. Non-remittance of Government Share from the proceeds of User Fees 
generated thru the Civil Registry System totaling to P225.125 million and 

$9,330.14 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Officer-

the total amount of P225.125 million and $9,330.14 to the Bureau of 

Treasury (BTr); (b) coordinate with the LBP to secure the credit and 

debit memos on the unaccounted deposit in the amount of $1,256.39 and 

unaccounted debit memos amounting to $7,186.92; and (c) thereafter, 

remit immediately the amount of identified deposit to the BTr. 
 

We also recommended that Management make a representation 

with the BTr to discuss and formulate a policy for establishing the 

amount of daily remittance by the PSA to the BTr in compliance with 

Section 4(w) of RA No. 11469 to avoid over remittance of Government 

Share. 
 

b. Non-remittance of various trust receipts to the BTr - P15.340 million  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the OIC-

Chief Accountant to: (a) deposit the excess balance of the completed 

projects and collection from the proceeds of registration fees amounting 

to P15.340 million; and (b) thereafter, prepare the necessary entries to 

accrue the income to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) of the General 

Fund, in consonance with laws, rules and regulations.   

 

c. Unreverted dormant/outstanding Accounts Payable for two years and above 
-  P47.332 million  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the OIC-

Chief, Accountant of the PSA-CO, and the Regional Directors of RSSO 

II and IVB to comply with the requirements on the reversion of the 

Accounts Payable with ages of more than two years. 

 

d. Non-elimination of reciprocal accounts (Intra-agency) – P78.447 million 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the OIC-

Chief Accountant to: (a) draft a policy on the liquidation of fund transfer 

which include among others, the submission of the monthly liquidation 

reports including the attachments and the deadline for submission and 

submit to the National Statistician for approval; (b) disseminate the 



 

v 

 

approved policy to the Accountants/Bookkeepers of various RSSOs and 

Provincial Statistical Offices (PSOs); and (c) monitor the submission of 

the liquidation reports including the attachments, as well as the 

recording of the liquidation and refund of excess of fund transfer in the 

books of accounts. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to direct the 

Regional Directors of RSSOs NCR and III to: (a)  require the 

Bookkeepers of PSOs to submit all supporting documents necessary for 

the liquidation of the fund transfer to facilitate the recording in the books 

of account; and (b) require the Regional Accountants to exert effort to 

locate the liquidation reports submitted by the PSOs and take up the 

liquidation reports submitted in CY 2020 and effect adjustments to 

reflect the correct balances of the accounts. 

 

We further reiterated our recommendation that Management 

require the CO OIC-Chief Accountant and RSSO Accountants to 

reconcile the noted differences with the Operating Units/Regional Offices 

to eliminate the intra-agency receivables and payables of prior years in 

consonance with accounting rules and regulations. 

 

e. Discrepancies between the balance per books and balance per Report on the 
Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) – P571.206

their records considering the deficiencies noted in this report and adjust 

the affected accounts accordingly; and (b) thereafter, conduct regular

Machinery and Equipment reported as Property, Plant and Equipment 

(PPE) in the RPCPPE to Report on the Physical Count of Inventories; 

and (b) Designated Property Custodian in RSSO I to expedite the tracing 

of the Property Acknowledgement Receipt or Property Transfer Receipt 

of the stolen/missing motor vehicle, if any, and ensure that all procedures 

and reports regarding lost, missing, and transferred PPEs are
