C.  Scope of Audit 

 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of ASTI for the year ended 

December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: a) verify the level of assurance that 

maybe placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) recommend 

agency’s improvement opportunities, (c) determine the propriety of transactions as well 

as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations, and (d) determine 

the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations. 

 

D.  Independent Auditor’s Report  

 

 A qualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements of ASTI as at 

December 31, 2020. 

 

E.  Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 

  

1. Property, Plant and Equipment recorded under the Trust Fund account with a balance 
of  ₱71,730,399.24 as of December 31, 2020 were overstated by ₱20,074,570.95, due 

to non-recording of depreciation in current and prior year as provided under Chapter 

10, Section 27 Volume 1 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM). Consequently, 

Accumulated Depreciation and Due to National Government Agencies (NGAs) were 

understated and overstated by the same amount, respectively.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 

compute and recognize depreciation on a monthly basis and in compliance with 

the guidelines provided under Section 27 Chapter 10, Volume 1 of  Government 

Accounting Manual (GAM) and adjust/correct the Due to NGAs and the 

corresponding Accumulated Depreciation accounts. 

 

2. The amortization of one lot of processing software purchased in 2019 out of GIA 
funds totaling ₱3,309,166.67 has not been recognized, contrary to Section 2 and 8, 

Chapter 12 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, resulting to an 

understatement of the accounts Due to National Government Agencies (NGAs) and 



iii 

 

Accumulated Amortization – Computer Software, both by the same amount, hence 

affecting the fair presentation of said accounts in the Financial Statements. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant to make 

the necessary adjustments to reflect the appropriate balance of Accumulated 

Amortization – Computer Software- Trust and Due to NGAs in the books of 

accounts.
