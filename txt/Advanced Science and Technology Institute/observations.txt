PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

  
Financial Audit 

 
Accounting Errors and Omissions  

 
1. The Office Supplies Inventory, Other Supplies and Materials Inventory,  
Accumulated Depreciation-Office Equipment, Accumulated Depreciation- 

Information and Communication Equipment, Accumulated Depreciation-Technical 

and Scientific Equipment, and Accumulated Amortization-Computer Software 

accounts as well as the Due to NGAs and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit accounts of 

the Advanced Science and Technology Institute (ASTI) were misstated by P24.39 

million, P23.38 million and P1.01 million which represent 2.04 percent of its total 

assets, 3.85 percent of its total liabilities and 0.17 percent of its net assets/equity as 

at December 31, 2020, resulting in over/understatements of the affected accounts. 

 

2. Paragraph 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 
and Section 15, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM)  for National 

Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I states that “The FSs shall present fairly the 

financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation 

requires the faithful presentation of effects of transactions, other events, and conditions 

in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, 

and expenses set out in IPSAS.” 

 

3. Moreover, Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 requires 
agencies to keep the accounts in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency 

and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control 

agencies of the government; and that the highest standard of honesty, objectivity and 

consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate 

and misleading information. Each government agency shall record its financial 

transactions and operations conformably with IPSAS and in accordance with pertinent 

laws and regulations. 

 

4. In our audit of the Agency’s accounts, we noted the following misstatements which 
were not adjusted by Management as at year-end.

5. Section 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides the guidelines 
relating to the considerations in the computation of Depreciation of items recorded as 

Property, Plant and Equipment and specifically states the following: 

 

xxx 

 

c. Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is 

in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in 

the manner intended by the management xx. 

 

d. Depreciation of an asset ceases when the asset is derecognized. Therefore, 

depreciation does not cease when the asset becomes idle or is retired from 

active use and held for disposal unless the asset is fully depreciated. 

 



45 

  

6. Likewise, Section 17, Chapter 10 of the same Manual also states that, in case the 
PPE was acquired by Implementing Agency/Entity through fund transfer, the 

Implementing Agency/Entity shall record and monitor the Property, Plant and Equipment 

procured out of inter-agency transferred funds when the PPE meets the recognition 

criteria and the Memorandum of Agreement/Understanding (MOA/U) provides that the 

PPE will be donated to the implementing agency/entity 

 

7. At the end of the project, the transfer shall be made with the MOA/U as in the 
following cases: 

 Case 1 – The MOA/U provides that the PPE will be donated to the 
agency/entity. 

 

 Case 2 – The MOA/U provides that the PPE will be returned by the 
Implementing Agency to the Source Agency/Entity. 

8. Further, it is illustrated in Annex M, Volume 1 of the GAM for NGAs that all 
expenses incurred whether cash or non-cash transactions are recognized and charged to 

Due to NGAs account at the end of the accounting period as part of the liquidation.

9. The Department of Science and Technology’s Grants-In-Aid (GIA) program aims 
to harness the country’s scientific and technological capabilities to spur and attain a 

sustainable economic growth and development. Through the funding of relevant science 

and technology (S&T) undertakings, the GIA program is designed to contribute to 

productivity improvement and quality of life of Filipinos by generating and promoting 

appropriate technologies. It also aims to strengthen the participation of various S&T 

sectors particularly in research and development, promotion technology transfer and 



46 

  

utilization, human resources development, information dissemination, advocacy and 

linkages. 

 

10. The ASTI as an Implementing Agency (IA) receives fund transfers from other 
government agencies which are called Source/Funding Agency (S/FA) for the 

implementation of projects that may require the acquisition of the necessary property, 

plant and equipment. 
 

11. In compliance with the Audit Recommendation contained in the Annual Audit 
Report for CY 2019, the Agency has caused the booking-up of various Property, Plant 

and Equipment purchased out of the Grants-in-Aid funds for the year 2019, amounting 

to P71,730,399.24, the details of which are shown below: 
 

Account Name 
Balance as at 

December 31, 2020 

ICT Equipment          62,000,807.82  

Office Equipment               229,394.00  

Technical and Scientific Equipment            9,500,197.42  

TOTAL          71,730,399.24  

 

12. Examination of the PPE schedule of the abovementioned accounts, however, 
showed that no depreciation was recorded since they were recognized in the books. 
 

13.  The Accountant acknowledged the non-recording of depreciation as at December 
31, 2020 for the recognized PPE purchased out of GIA funds. The Accounting Unit 

overlooked the generation of the depreciation schedule in the eNGAS for the year 2020, 

since prior to the booking up of said PPE, there were no recorded PPE under the Trust 

Fund. The depreciation schedule generated for recording included only PPE from the 

Regular Agency Fund -  GAA and Continuing Appropriations. The absence of 

depreciation accounts for the said PPE was only noticed during the preparation of the 

Annual Financial Statements. Hence, starting January 2021, the monthly recording of the 

depreciation for PPE under Trust Fund has been initiated. 
 

14. This resulted in the understatement of related Accumulated Depreciation accounts 
and the overstatement of Due to NGAs by ₱20,074,570.95, as presented in Table 2 below:

15. Consequently, the book values of the above PPE were overstated by 
₱20,074,570.95, as shown below:

16. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

a. adjust/correct the Due to NGAs and the corresponding Accumulated 
Depreciation accounts; and 

 

b. henceforth, compute and recognize depreciation on a monthly basis and 
in compliance with the guidelines provided under Section 27, Chapter 10 

of the GAM, Volume I. 

 

b. Non-recording of Amortization expense for Computer Software purchased out of 
GIA Funds amounting to ₱3,309,166.67 

 

17. Section 2, Chapter 12 - Intangible Assets of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I defines 
Amortization as the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an intangible asset 

over its useful life. 

 

18. Further, Section 8, Chapter 12 of the same Manual states that after initial 
recognition, intangible assets should be carried at its cost less any accumulated 

amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. 

 

19. Moreover, it is illustrated in Annex M of the GAM, Volume I that all expenses 
incurred whether cash or non-cash transactions are recognized and charged to Due to 

NGAs account at the end of the accounting period as part of the liquidation.  

 



48 

  

20. In response to an audit observation in the previous Annual Audit Report pertaining 
to the non-recording of the computer software purchased out of the GIA funds, an 

adjustment in the books was made to recognize the purchase of Intangible Assets of 

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Automatic Identification System (AIS) for 

Innovative Terrestrial Monitoring and Maritime Surveillance Year 1. As at December 

31, 2020, the balances of Computer Software and Accumulated Amortization - Computer 

Software, both in the Trust Fund, are ₱10,450,000.00 and ₱0.00, respectively.  

 

21. The ASTI, based on its best estimate, has set the useful life of computer software 
to five (5) years in accordance with the prescribed useful life in the GAM which is two 

(2) years to ten (10) years. Verification of the related general ledgers, however, showed 

that no amortization has been recognized and recorded. Details are as follows:

TOTAL   10,450,000.00      3,309,166.67 - 3,309,166.67 

 

22. It can be gleaned from Table 4 above, that no amortization was recognized and 
recorded, thus, the Accumulated Amortization - Computer Software - Trust was 

understated and the Due to NGAs account was overstated, both by  ₱3,309,166.67. The 

Accountant acknowledged the non-recording of depreciation as at December 31, 2020 

for the recognized PPE purchased out of GIA funds. The Accounting Unit further 



49 

  

explained (see paragraph 13) that they overlooked the generation of the depreciation 

schedule in the eNGAS for the year 2020, since prior to the booking up of said PPE, 

there were no recorded PPE under the Trust Fund. 

 

23. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to make 
the necessary adjustments to reflect the appropriate balance of Accumulated 

Amortization-Computer Software-Trust and Due to NGAs in the books of accounts. 

 

c. Non-recording of issued office supplies and other supplies and materials as 
expense amounting to ₱233,295.13 and ₱773,041.66, respectively 

 

24. Section 7 (Recognition as an Expense), Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 
I, provides that “When inventories are sold, exchanged, or distributed, their carrying 

amount shall be recognized as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is 

recognized. If there is no related revenue, the expense is recognized when the goods are 

distributed or the related service is rendered.” 

 

25. Section 9 of the same Chapter provides that “Supplies and materials purchased for 
inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual inventory system, resulting in a 

more accurate inventory records and a running total for the cost of goods sold in each 

period. The system requires accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand 

at all times through the maintenance of the Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) (Appendix 57) 

by the Accounting Division/Unit and Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) by the Supply 

and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock. Regular purchases shall be coursed 

through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded as they take place 

except for supplies and materials purchased out of Petty Cash Fund (PCF) for immediate 

use or on emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense 

accounts.” 

 

26. Section 13 provides that “Physical count/inventory, which is required semi-
annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property 

custodianship.” 

 

27. Section 17 (g.) prescribes the preparation of Report of Supplies and Materials 
Issued (RSMI) “by the Property and/or Supply Custodian based on the Requisition and 

Issue Slip (RIS) and shall be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing 

the JEV to record the supplies and materials issued.” 

 

28. It is further provided in Section 17 (i.) that the “Report on the Physical Count of 
Inventories (RPCI) (Appendix 66) – shall be used to report the physical count of supplies 

by type of inventory as at a given date. It shows the balance of inventory items per card 

and per count and shortage/overage, if any. These include the semi-expendable property 

wherein the issue is covered by Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) (Appendix 59). 

 

29. As at December 31, 2020, the balances of Office Supplies Inventory and Other 
Supplies and Materials Inventory totaled ₱714,809.70 and ₱3,216,952.11, respectively. 



50 

  

Verification of the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) and reconciliation 

thereof with the Inventory Schedule, disclosed the following deficiencies: 

 

Office Supplies Inventory 

 

 Differences among the books, stock cards and the physical count overstated the 
account by ₱233,295.13. 

 

30. Reconciliation of the Office Supplies Inventory account with the RPCI revealed a 
discrepancy between the balances per books and per count.  Further verification was made 

and revealed that a number of items that are still recorded in the books were already issued 

as per the stock cards, thereby overstating the account by ₱233,295.13, as shown in Annex 

1. 

 

 Office Supplies items found in the RPCI were unrecorded in the books as at 

December 31, 2020. 

31. Verification revealed that there were Office Supplies items listed in the RPCI but 
are still unrecorded in the books due to late submission of the required documents for 

recording in the books, as shown below:

Other Supplies and Materials Inventory 

 

 Discrepancies between the stock card and RPCI balances resulted in the 
overstatement of the Other Supplies and Materials Inventory account by 

₱650,629.09. 

 

33. During the conduct of the physical count, it was found that some or all of the items 
were already issued by the Custodian as at December 31, 2020; however, the Requisition 

and Issue Slip (RIS) was yet to be submitted by the Custodian to the Property Section for 

updating in the Stock Card (SC) and for the preparation of the RSMI, for submission to 

the Financial and Accounting Division (FAD) (please see Annex 2). 

 

 Other Supplies and Materials Inventory items that were already issued per 
stock card were still unrecorded as expense in the books amounting to 

₱122,412.57 

 

34. Also noted were items that were already issued per stock card as at December 31, 
2020 but were unrecorded in the Accounting records as expense, due to the delay in the 

submission of the RSMI resulting in an overstatement of Other Supplies and Materials 

Inventory by ₱122,412.57 (please see Annex 3). 

 

 Several technical and promotional items of undetermined amounts were not 
included in the Inventory Schedule per books but are found in the RPCI.    

 

35. Upon inquiry made with the Property Officer in charge of the report, it was found 
that these were technical items and supplies previously recorded in the books as Other 

Supplies and Materials Expenses. It was also noted that some items were not issued and 

should be reverted to Inventory (please see Annex 4). 

 

36. The noted deficiencies resulted in the overstatement of the Office Supplies 
Inventory and Other Supplies and Materials Inventory accounts amounting to 

₱233,295.13 and ₱ 773,041.66, respectively. 

 

 

37. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Property Division to submit immediately the RSMI to the Financial

and Administrative Division (FAD) and both Offices, to make necessary 

adjustments in their records;  

 

b. The Property Division to submit the list of the unused technical supplies 
to the FAD for reversion to the Inventory account; 

 

c. The Property Division and FAD to, henceforth, conduct a regular 
reconciliation of the Inventory records. 

 

38. In summary, due to the significant impact on the financial statements of the total 
misstatements of ₱24,390,074.41, ₱23,383,737.62, and ₱1,006,336.79, representing 2.04 

percent of the agency’s total assets, 3.85 percent of its total liabilities, and 0.17 percent 

of its net assets/equity, respectively, we rendered a Qualified Opinion on the Financial 

Statements of the ASTI as at year-end.  

 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

39. Various deficiencies were also noted in recording transactions totaling 
P711,733,318.06 affecting the existence, accuracy, reliability and accountability of 

the FSs accounts as at year-end.

40. The accuracy and existence of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) totaling                 
P1,075,843,331.32 could not be relied upon due to: (a) the existence of net 

discrepancies of P541,926,351.94 between the accounting and property records; and 

(b) submission of incomplete CY 2020 Report on the Physical Count of Property, 

Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE). 
41. Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs provides for the Accounting and 
Property Records to be maintained for PPE. The Chief Accountant shall maintain the 

PPELC for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The 



53 

  

PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated 

useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. 

For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC 

for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The 

balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting 

Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like PAR. 

 

42. As at December 31, 2020, the reported balances of ten (10) Property, Plant and 
Equipment (PPE) totaled P1,075,843,331.32, broken down as follows:

43. The balances of the PPE accounts reflected in the year-end financial statements 
cannot be relied upon and considered doubtful due to: 

 

 Existence of net discrepancies of for ten (10) PPE accounts between the 
accounting/property records.   

 

44. Comparison of balances of ten (10) PPE accounts per accounting/property records 
furnished us disclosed a net difference of P541,926,351.94. The details are shown below:

45. Analysis showed that parts of the variance are: 
 

 Non-inclusion in the RPCPPE of the Property, Plant and Equipment recorded 
under the Trust Fund in the books amounting to P71,730,399.24, details as 

shown below: 

 

 Office Equipment – Trust                P      229,394.00

  Total         P 71,730,399.24 

 

 Submission of incomplete 2020 RPCPPE 
  

46. Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that the Entity 
shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented 

on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as at 

December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than 

January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during 

the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper 

accounting/recording. 

 

47. The Property Division has conducted the physical count of PPE for 2020 but the 
voluminous property items and the limitations of the COVID-19 pandemic hindered the 

completion of the physical count. Thus, an incomplete RPCPPE was submitted. The total 

cost of items counted amounted to P145,078,808.16 out of the total of P533,916,979.38 

taken from the conduct of inventory. 

 

48. It is emphasized that the physical inventory-taking is important in order to: (a) 
assess the integrity of property custodianship of accountable employees; (b) note 

exceptions during physical count such as PPEs not found in the station, 

missing/inexistent, and found in the station but not recorded in the Property Card/ 



55 

  

Property Ledger Card or any record maintained by the Property Division; and (c) 

communicate such noted exceptions to the FAD and the Property Division  for 

reconciliation and recording purposes, to establish accountability, existence and accuracy 

of the initially recorded balances. 

 

49. In the RPCPPE submitted, we likewise noted other concerns that need to be 
attended to, as mentioned below: 

 

 The classification of PPEs in the RPCPPE are not harmonized with that of the 
FAD making it hard to reconcile the records per books and per RPCPPE as 

shown below:

 The remarks portion of the RPCPPE does not indicate the whereabouts, 
conditions and other relevant information relative to PPE.  

 

50. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Property Division to: 
 

i. complete the conduct of the physical count of PPE; 
 

ii. reconcile the property records with the Accounting reports; 
 

iii. submit the RPCPPE to COA on January 31 of every year in the 
format prescribed in Appendix 73 of the GAM, Volume II; and 

 

iv. use the same PPE account classification with that of FAD, if 
possible; and 

 

b. The Accountant to: 
 

i. reconcile the records of the FAD with that of the Property Division; 
and 

 

ii. make the necessary adjusting entries, if warranted, for a fair 
presentation  in the Financial Statements. 

 

51. Management informed us that the PPE reconciliation of the FAD based on records 
of the Property Division is currently ongoing.  An initial work plan and guide was 

formulated so as to continue the reconciliation of records despite the ongoing 

pandemic/modified work arrangements implemented by the Institute. 

 

Unliquidated Fund Transfers to NGAs 

 

52. The Due from NGAs account balance of ₱4,396,360.32 is unreliable due to the 
balance of ₱947,533.36 representing funds transferred to the DOST-ROs for the 

implementation of the DOST Grants-In-Aid (GIA) projects that remained 

unliquidated, despite the completion of the projects, contrary to COA Circular No. 

94-013 dated December 13, 1994. 
 

53. Pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated 13 December 1994 provide 
– 

 

4.3  The fund to be transferred or sub-allotted to the IA shall be (a) in an amount 

sufficient for three months operation subject to replenishment upon submission of 

the reports of disbursements by the IA, or (b) the total project cost, as may be 

determined by the Heads of the two agencies in either case.  

 



57 

  

4.6  Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period 

for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the 

Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds.  Only actual 

project expenses shall be reported.  The reports shall be approved by the Head of 

the IA.  

 

4.7  The SA shall draw a Journal Voucher to take up the reports.  The amount 

to take up the liquidation per the RCI shall be net of the cash advances granted by 

the IA to its accountable officers in accordance with Commission on Audit Circular 

No. 90-331 dated May 3, 1990. 

 

4.9  The IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion of the 

project. 

 

54. The ASTI and the Department of Science and Technology Regional Offices 
(DOST-ROs) have signed Memoranda of Agreement engaging the latter for assistance in 

the implementation of the project titled “Deployment of Early Warning System (DEWS) 

in Disaster-Prone Areas” in the provinces under their jurisdiction, through the use of their 

knowledge of the locale and their established linkages, as well as providing the necessary 

manpower to complete the activities related to the project, especially the deployment, 

installation and maintenance, and troubleshooting of hydrometeorological (hydromet) 

and warning devices, at the soonest time possible. 

 

55. Part of the responsibilities of the ASTI, as stated in several MOA, is to coordinate, 
monitor and ensure compliance with the implementation of the projects and the 

attainment of project objectives. 

 

56. ASTI Management, for CY 2017, has transferred funds totaling ₱6,950,436.03 to 
DOST-ROs for the implementation of the project, as shown below:

57. As at December 31, 2020, the account Due from NGAs has a balance of 
₱4,396,360.32, of which ₱947,533.36 pertains to the balance of the funds transferred to 

the DOST-ROs. Worth noting is the fund transferred to DOST-ARMM amounting to 

₱936,157.60 which has not been liquidated for more than three years since its transfer in 

2017. Management informed that they have lost contact with the DOST-ARMM as it had 

stopped operations during the transition to Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim 

Mindanao (BARMM). ASTI has requested the Ministry of Science and Technology 

(MOST-BARMM) for previous records. A photocopy of the pertinent Financial Report 

has been received by Management, awaiting the original copy for immediate recording 

in the books. 

 

58. In the case of the DOST-CAR, the Audit Team was informed that the unexpended 
balance of P11,375.76 was directly deposited through LDDAP in April 2019 to the 

Bureau of the Treasury (BTr)-ASTI account not on the main BTr account. Management 

informed that they will advise the said regional office to send to ASTI the certified copy 

of the validated LDDAP and the original copy of the Audited Financial Report, for FAD 

to record the same in the books to close the fund transfer balance. 

 

59. The delayed recording of liquidations of funds due from the ROs may affect the 
reliability of the Due from NGAs balance in the Financial Statements, as the deductions 

in the form of liquidations, if not recorded on time, will not be properly reflected in the 

actual balance. 

 

60. We recommended and Management agreed to prepare the notices of demand 
or demand letters to the DOST-CAR through the Office of the Undersecretary for 

Regional Operations and MOST- BARMM for the immediate liquidation of the 

funds transferred to them. 

 

 

 

Unliquidated fund transfers to GOCC’s  

 

61. Inadequate planning for the implementation of the iGov-Phils Project resulted 
in non-completion of the said project and non-liquidation of the funds transferred 

to the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) and Subic Bay 

Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) for over four to six years, totaling ₱168,995,494.20, 



59 

  

due to the delays incurred in the procurement process in the prior years, hindered 

the implementation of the project and utilization of funds, contrary to COA Circular 

No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994. 

 

62. COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 provides the rules and 
regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to implementing 

agencies.  This is to ensure that the transfer is properly taken up in the books of the Source 

Agency (SA) and the IA, and that the transferred funds are used only for the intended 

purpose, and that proper accounting and reporting is made of the utilization of the funds. 

 

63. Section 4.6 of the said Circular states that within ten (10) days after the end of each 
month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks 

Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds. 

 

64. Section 9 of the same Circular provides Limitation in the Use of the Fund Transfer, 
that:  “In no case shall the fund transferred be utilized for the payment of additional 

compensation to employees in the form of allowances, incentive pay, bonuses, 

honorarium, or other forms of additional compensation, except as may be authorized by 

law or existing regulations, nor shall it be used to create new positions, to augment 

salaries of regular personnel or in case of purchase motor vehicles without prior approval 

of the Office of the President.” 

 

65. As at December 31, 2020, the Due from GOCCs account has a balance of 
₱168,995,494.20, as shown in Table 9 below:

a. Unliquidated Funds transferred to PITC - ₱160,765,021.12 
 

66. The ASTI and the PITC signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) on January 
27, 2012 engaging the latter as provider of its procurement outsourcing requirements. A 

fund transfer was made on December 29, 2016 amounting to ₱379,765,000.00 under 

LDDAP-ADA No. 9916122401 for the acquisition of satellite images and installation of 

network connectivity per Agency Outsourcing Request dated December 21, 2016. These 

were broken into two (2) Lots as shown below: 

 

Lot No. Particulars Contract Price 

1 Supply and delivery of satellite images ₱174,765,000.00 

2 Supply, delivery and installation of Network Connectivity which 
includes: 

 

 Item A – International Private Line (IPL)to Singapore     87,340,000.00 

 Item B – International Private Line (IPL) to the United States of 
America (USA) 

  117,660,000.00 

 TOTAL ₱379,765,000.00 

 

67. As at December 31, 2020, the PITC was able to make partial liquidations as 
follows: 

 

Year Amount of Liquidation 

2018 ₱    32,383,961.05 

2019 113,910,290.73 

2020 72,705,727.10 

Total ₱  218,999,978.88 

 

68. The fund transfer balance of P160,765,021.12 for the procurement outsourcing 
services of the PITC consisted of the following: 

 

a. Unexpended balances of completed procurement for the Supply and delivery 
of one (1) lot Very-High Resolution Satellite Images which consist of 1) High 

Resolution Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Satellite Imagery and 

II) Very High-Resolution Optical Satellite Imagery amounting to P143,266.70 

and P62,745.60, respectively; 

 

b. Ongoing Network Connectivity for IPL to Singapore with a monthly rate of 
P1,868,969.20 which will end on October 11, 2021 amounting to 

P42,899,008.81; and  

 

c. Ongoing procurement for the “Supply, Delivery and Installation of IPL to the 
United States of America” with an Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC) 

of P117,660,000.00.   

 

69. As per  Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), the due date for liquidation falls on 
the receipt of complete delivery of the procured items, which depends solely on the 



61 

  

timeline of the procurement process. This has no definite period, and so is the completion 

of the project, and ultimately, the liquidation of the funds utilized. 

 

70. It has been informed that ASTI has been in constant coordination with PITC 
through email on the remaining IPL procurement and the submission on the latest 

liquidation report. As at October 21, 2020, the signed Post Qualification Evaluation 

Report (PQER) was forwarded to PITC for their processing. Lowest Calculated Bidder 

(LCB) is ₱64,818,415.56 from Converge Information and Communications Technology 

Solutions. 

 

b.      Unliquidated Funds transferred to SBMA - ₱8,094,411.64. 
 

71. A MOA was entered into by and between the Information and Communications 
Technology Office (ICTO), now Department of Information and Communications 

Technology (DICT),  ASTI and SBMA that engaged in joint collaboration and 

cooperation for the procurement activities, renovation and construction of the SBMA 

property for the purpose of housing and operating the National Government Data Center 

3 (NGDC 3) which is an integral part of the Integrated Government Philippines 

(iGovPhil) Project as needed/implemented by ICTO (now DICT) and ASTI. 

 

72. Hence, an amount of ₱21,000,000.00 was transferred to the SBMA under Check 
No. 1144608 on February 17, 2014, for the establishment and operation of the National 

Government Data Center 3 (NGDC 3) Project. The ICTO (now DICT) also contributed 

₱29,000,000.00 for the same project. 

 

73. It was gathered that the MOA among ICTO, ASTI, and SBMA have a disclosure 
that the ICTO and ASTI “intends to spend an estimated ₱135.5 million within the next 

two years to put up the project”. However, there are no specific timelines for the 

implementation of the various activities required of the project. Worth noting, too, is that 

no effective date has been stated in the MOA.  Thus, the utilization of the funds and the 

completion of the project are without definite deadlines, which is indicative of inadequate 

planning. 

 

74. ASTI has reiterated to the NGDC3 Project Team the need to complete the project 
by the end of the year 2020, as this will be used initially as a disaster recovery site for the 

requirements of the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys). The FAD / Accounting 

Unit met with DICT and SBMA NGDC3 Project Team via videoconference last 23 

September 2020, and the submission of the latest and original audited F/R for submission 

to ASTI-COA. It was also mentioned in the meeting that the target implementation is 

June 30, 2021 and also includes the return of unexpended balance. 

 

75. Nonetheless, the project is yet to be completed throughout its project duration. Out 
of ₱21,000,000.00 funds transferred, ₱12,905,588.36 or 61.46% of the total amount has 

been liquidated as at December 31, 2020, thereby, leaving the balance of ₱8,094,411.64 

unliquidated for more than six (6) years from its transfer. 

 



62 

  

c. Some provisions in the MOA are contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013 as quoted 

below: 

 

76. Article VII Fund Limitations of the MOA among ICTO, ASTI, and SBMA provides 
the following: 

 

1.  Unless otherwise included in the Budget, no portion of the funds 
transferred to SBMA shall be used for the following: 

a. xxx 
b. xxx 
c. Payment of salaries xxx.  For the avoidance of doubt, members of the 

PMO of the SBMA and all other SBMA personnel who are connected 

to the Project may be paid salaries, honoraria or allowances, subject 

to inclusion in the budget, and xxx. 

 

77. The above provisions in the MOA are contrary to Section 9 of COA Circular No. 
94-013, which states that “In no case shall the fund transferred be utilized for the payment 

of additional compensation to employees in the form of allowances, incentive pay, 

bonuses, honorarium, or other forms of additional compensation, except as may be 

authorized by law or existing regulations, nor shall it be used to create new positions, to 

augment salaries of regular personnel or in case of purchase motor vehicles without prior 

approval of the Office of the President”. 

 

78. We recommended and Management agreed to demand the implementing 
agencies to: 

 

a. expedite the completion of the project and the utilization of funds 
transferred; 
 

b. facilitate the liquidation of the funds, pursuant to COA Circular No. 94-
013; and 

 

c. review existing MOA for provisions that may violate existing rules and 
regulations. 

 

79. Management informed us of the remaining portion of the unliquidated funds 
transferred to PITC for Lot 2. Supply, Delivery, and Installation of Network Connectivity 

and the significance and benefits of the IPL – SG and USA  as follows: 

 

 As a National Research and Education Network (NREN), PREGINET's 
connectivity to global REN consortium such as the Asia Pacific Advanced 

Network (APAN) in the Asia-Pacific, is crucial for its increased growth and 

capability to carry out data-intensive and highly collaborative research and 

education activities with partners in the Asia-Pacific region, USA and Europe. 

These activities are only possible through these high-speed specialized 

networks that enable our local researchers and scientists to collaborate on some 



63 

  

of the world's most important scientific/ research endeavors such as food 

security, drug discovery, vaccine development and COVID-19, among others. 

 

 In cases where the scientific research, medical research, telemedicine or the 
academic research communities have strong linkages or collaborative activities 

in a counterpart organization in another country, it is strategic for the NREN to 

establish a direct connectivity to that country in order to achieve maximum 

benefits for both countries. The specific benefits include: 

 

a. Increase network redundancy - Network redundancy means having multiple 
paths of connectivity so that when one path breaks down, the connection would 

be switched to another path. Implementing this in PREGINET ensures the 

reliability of the NREN's services so that in cases of fiber cuts (domestically) 

or submarine cable damage (internationally), our connection to our 

collaborators in the USA or Singapore will not be significantly affected. 

 

b.  Obtain end-to-end transfer speeds - Having a direct connectivity provides 
the high-bandwidth connection needed to carry out large data transfers. Over 

PREGINET, we have seen a large volume of data being transferred and 

received from the USA, so having a direct connection to USA would better 

optimize the data exchange and data transfer speeds, as well as improve access 

of our local researchers and scientists to remote research resources. 

 

c. Improve peering connections to both commercial and scientific Internet 

Exchanges that support REN activities - Establishing peering connections 

means to have direct path to another network, thereby reducing the distance 

that data has to travel, and resulting to improved user experience and efficiency 

for researchers and scientists to carry out their research activities. 

 

Particularly, the direct connectivity to USA and Singapore provides an 

opportunity for the Philippines to interconnect to other internet exchange 

points such as in Guam—GOREX and its partners, particularly the University 

of Hawaii, as well as collaboration with ARENA-PAC, a regional backbone 

network interconnecting Guam, Tokyo, Indonesia and now Philippines, to 

strengthen the R&E networks and facilities, as well as capacitate network 

operators in the Asia-Pacific region. Having a lot of internet exchange points 

would help us in managing data transfers for a better network performance for 

the local partners. 

 

d. Access to scientific databases - Scientific databases such as the Bio-Mirror, 

a worldwide collection of DNA/ protein biological sequence databanks being 

accessed by bioinformatics and genomics scientists worldwide, including our 

local scientists, will have a local mirror as a result of PREGINET's direct link 

to Singapore. Having local mirror sites for these kinds of databases benefits 

our researchers and scientists by improving their access and download speeds 

for these large datasets. 



64 

  

 

e. Participation in telemedicine activities - This connectivity would scale up 

telemedicine activities in the country through our partnership with Sing 

AREN, the NREN of Singapore which is known to aid research projects on 

cancer genomics and precision medicine.

80. Management also commented that they had sent an email on April 14, 2021 to the 
DICT and NGDC3 PMO with an accompanying formal letter informing them that their 

fund extension validity request has been denied and demanded: (a) immediate submission 

of the audited financial report; and (b)  reversion of the unexpended balance back to the 

Institute. 

 

81. Management also informed the Audit Team that no payment of salaries/honoraria 
was observed on the reported disbursements for the DOST-ASTI fund transfer 

component; nevertheless, they shall formally relay and transmit the audit observation to 

the DICT. 

 

Compliance Audit  
 

Erroneous computation of Honoraria 

 

82. Honoraria paid to personnel assigned in Special Projects amounting to 
₱1,114,800.00 based on DOST Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 001 s. 2003, and 

lack of necessary documentary requirements to support payment for the services 

rendered are contrary to the provisions of DBM-DOST Joint Circular (JC) No. 1 s. 

2013 dated June 25, 2013, DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 2007-2 dated October 1, 

2007, and COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. 
 

83. Section 50 of RA 11465, or FY 2020 General Appropriations Act, states that “the 
payment of Magna Carta benefits of public health workers, school teachers, social 

workers, scientists, engineers and researchers, and other science and technology 

personnel in the government shall be subject to the guidelines issued by the DBM." 

 

84. Section 53 of the same Act provides that “Honoraria may be paid only to the 
following: 

 

a. xxx 
b. xxx 

c. xxx 

 

d. Those who are involved in science and technological activities and render 

services beyond their regular workload; 

 



65 

  

e. Officials and employees assigned to special projects, subject to the 

following conditions: 

 

i. Said special projects are reform-oriented or developmental, contribute to the 

improvement of service delivery and enhancement of the performance of the 

core functions of the agency, and have specific timeframes and deliverables 

in accomplishing objectives and milestones set by the agency for the year; 

and 

 

ii. Such assignment entails rendition of work in addition to, or over and above, 

their regular workload. 

 

In these instances, the rates of honoraria shall depend on the level of 

responsibilities, nature of work rendered, and extent of individual 

contribution to produce the desired outputs.  The total honoraria received 

from all special projects shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of 

the annual basic salaries; 

 

85. The grant of honoraria to the foregoing shall be subject to the guidelines prescribed 
under B.C. No. 2003-5 dated September 26, 2003, as amended by B.C. No. 2007-1 dated 

April 23, 2007 and N.B.C No. 2007-510 dated May 8, 2007, B.C No. 2007-2 dated 

October 1, 2007, B.C No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005, as amended by B.C No. 2007-

3 dated November 29, 2007, DBM and DOST J.C No.1 dated June 25, 2013 and such 

other guidelines issued by the DBM.”(emphasis supplied)Xx 

 

86. Section 4.3 of DBM-DOST JC No.1, s.2013 states that “as token payment for 
services rendered beyond the regular duties and responsibilities of their positions, 

Honoraria for Assignment in Special Projects may be granted.Xx 

 

4.3.1 The total Honoraria per personnel for a month shall be based on 

productivity and quality of completed and accepted deliverables for the set 

timeframe.  Hence, a special project plan shall be prepared, in consultation with 

all personnel concerned, subject to approval by the agency head.  Such plan shall 

contain the following details: 

 

4.3.1.1 Outputs or deliverables per project component; 

4.3.1.2 Project timetable 

4.3.1.3 Personnel assigned to the special project and their duties and      

responsibilities 

4.3.1.4 Expected deliverables per personnel; and 

4.3.1.5 Estimated cost of monthly honoraria for each personnel based on work 

hours spent beyond the regular work hours, computed as follows: 

 

Estimated Honoraria =   Salary 1 Month 1Day     T hours 

       Month     22 Days 8 Hours 



66 

  

  

  

Where:  

   Salary = Step 1 of the Salary Grade for the designated 

position 

 T= estimated numbers of work hours spent in the special project 

 

87. The above estimated computation of Honoraria per personnel per project is also 
initially expressed in the DBM BC No. 2007-2 dated October 1, 2007. Further, said DBM 

BC No. 2007-2 provides for the following necessary provisions: 

 

88. Section 4.5. Payment of the honorarium shall be made only upon completion and 
acceptance by the agency head of the deliverable per project component. 

 

89. Section 4.6. The actual honorarium to be paid to each personnel shall depend on 
the performance rating to be given by the project management, as follows: 

  

 

 

90. For example, if the performance rating is Very Satisfactory, the actual honorarium 
to be paid as follows: 

 

Actual Honorarium = 85% (H) 

 

91. Section 4.7  For rating purposes, the project management shall formulate a 
performance evaluation plan that is transparent and fair, and considers timeliness, quality 

of outputs, and other applicable work efficiency determinants. 

 

92. COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated 14 June 2012, provides for the following 
provisions and documentary requirements in the payment of honoraria: 

 

5.7 General Guidelines. Government personnel performing activities or 

discharging duties in addition to, or over and above their regular functions maybe 

granted honoraria. 

 

5.7.1 Special Projects. Documentary Requirements: 

 Performance evaluation plan formulated by project management used as 

basis for rating the performance of members 

 Office Order designating members of the special projects 

 Terms of Reference 

 Certificate of completion of project deliverables 

 Special Project Plan 

Performance Rating % of Estimated Honoraria per project Component 
Outstanding 100% 

Very Satisfactory 85% 

Satisfactory 70% 



67 

  

 Authority to collect honoraria 

 Certificate of acceptance by the agency head of the deliverables per 

project component 

 

93. For CY 2020, ASTI paid honoraria to several employees under the Grants-In-Aid 
(GIA) Program of the DOST for special projects amounting to ₱1,114,800.00. Review of 

the disbursement vouchers and its corresponding attachments revealed the following: 

 

i. Amount paid as Honoraria was computed on the basis of DOST MC No. 001 s. 
2003 

 

94. Management computed the amount paid as honoraria on the basis of DOST 
Memorandum Circular No. 001 series of 2003 which provides for a fixed rate on a 

given period, contrary to the computation prescribed by the DBM-DOST Joint Circular 

No.1, s.2013 and DBM Budget Circular as follows: 

 
Position Honoraria Rate per Month 

Project  Leader 8,800.00 

Project  Staff L2 6,000.00 

Project Staff  L1 4,800.00 

Project Support Staff 500.00 

 

95. As noted above, no performance rating was used in the computation of honoraria 
contrary to Budget Circular (BC) No. 2007-2, the actual workhours spent by the personnel 

assigned for the project was not determined, and formula prescribed by the Joint Circular 

No. 1 was not followed. Instead, a fixed rate was used on the basis of the repealed and 

old DOST Memorandum Circular. Following the fixed rate computed by the Agency, the 

payment could not clearly show the involvement made by the personnel nor can it be 

determined that the activity was indeed performed beyond their regular workload. As 

stated clearly in the Joint Circular, the basis in the payment of honoraria shall be the 

productivity of the personnel involved and that special projects related activities shall be 

discharged of in addition to or over and above their regular functions. The above-cited 

computation is necessary to see to it that the personnel’s regular workload would not be 

jeopardized despite performing their duties in other special projects. 

 

96. As stipulated in Section 6 of Senate and House of Representatives Joint Circular 
No. 4 dated July 28, 2008, “DBM is hereby authorized to issue the necessary guidelines, 

rules and regulations on the grant of Magna Carta Benefits authorized for specific 

officials and employees in the government, thus the DBM, in coordination with the 

agencies concerned, shall determine the qualifications, conditions and rates in the grant 

of said benefits.  Accordingly, the consultative councils, departments and officials 

previously authorized to issue the implementing rules and regulations of Magna Carta 

benefits shall no longer exercise said function relative to the grant of such benefits.” 

Hence, the practice of using the fixed rate prescribed in DBM-DOST Joint Circular No.1, 

DOST Memorandum Circular No. 001 s. 2003 is no longer valid. 

 



68 

  

97. Further, the repealing clause of the Joint Circular provides that all existing 
provisions or issuance on the grant of compensation-related Magna Carta benefits to S&T 

Personnel that are inconsistent with the provisions of this Joint Circular are repealed or 

suspended accordingly. 

 

ii. Absence of necessary documentary requirements contrary to COA Circular No. 
2012-001 dated 14 June 2012 

 

98. Verification of the DVs submitted in the payment for honoraria revealed only the 
following were attached as supporting documents: 

 

a. Special Order for the grant of Honoraria showing the names, role, 

monthly/quarterly rate of the personnel involved in the special project 

b. Annual Progress Report  

c. Semi-Annual Progress Report 

d. Project Work Plan 

e. General Payroll 

99. As such, we noted the absence of necessary supporting documents like the 
performance evaluation plan which is used as basis for rating the performance of 

members, the certificate of completion of project deliverables, and the certificate of 

acceptance by the agency head of the deliverables per project. 

 

100. Further, there have been no Terminal Reports submitted to the Audit Team that 
may suggest completion of the project in order to qualify for the payment of honoraria.  

The annual progress report attached to the DVs states the actual start date and the 

expected completion date, but not the actual completion date. The Joint Circular, Budget 

Circular and COA Circular correlatively stressed that payment of Honoraria must be 

based on the productivity and quality of completed and accepted deliverables. The 

condition is if, and only if, there is completed and accepted deliverables shall there be 

payment of honoraria. 

 

101. Complete documentation in the payment of honoraria is necessary to be able to 
verify the accuracy of the amount paid. The completion and accepted deliverables, the 

performance evaluation plan, special project plan, actual performance rating, timeframes 

and terms of reference, man hours spent by each personnel in the discharge of their duties 

in the special project beyond their regular workload, among others, are indispensable 

components in the computation of allowable amount of honoraria that the personnel is 

entitled to. 

 

102. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. require the personnel responsible to immediately submit the necessary 

documents required under COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated 14 June 

2012; 



69 

  

b. henceforth, strictly comply with the computation prescribed under the 

DBM-DOST Joint Circular (JC) No. 1, s. 2013; and 

c. undertake the conduct of special project plan and performance evaluation 

plan following the guidelines set under the DBM-DOST Joint Circular (JC) 

No. 1, s. 2013 dated June 25, 2013, and DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 

2007-2 dated October 1, 2007  

103. Management informed us that the agency is following the computation as 
prescribed by the DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1-203, but the amount cannot be used 

as these are beyond what is allowed under the DOST GIA guidelines. Hence, the 

honoraria rates found in DOST MC No. 1 s. 2003 were used, which are in accordance 

with the project’s approved line-item-budget (LIB). 

 

104. Management also submitted Special Project Plan and Project Evaluation Plan to the 
Audit Team in compliance with COA Circular No. 2012-01 dated June 14, 2012. 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

105. Management should strictly observe DBM-DOST Joint Circular regardless of the 
resultant increase in the payment of Honoraria as the DOST MC No. 1 s. 2003 was already 

repealed and superseded by authorizing the DBM to issue the standards in the 

qualifications, conditions, and rates in the grant of Magna Carta benefits, in coordination 

with the agencies concerned.  

 

106. The LIB for each special projects merely provides for the budgeted/projected cost 
for each expenditure and not necessarily a standing regulation/standard/guideline that 

prescribes the rates that should be followed nor is it the actual amount to be paid to 

claimants. It provides for the ceiling for the amounts to be expended for each type of 

expenses. However, the actual computation of the honoraria which considers the actual 

hours beyond regular working hours spent for the special project and performance rating 

among others, is different and must still be in accord with the Joint Circular with the LIB 

as its limit on the amount to be given as honoraria. 

 

 Other Compliance Audit 

 
 Programs and Projects Related to GAD 

 

107. The ASTI allocated ₱73,313,500.00 or 22% of the Agency’s total 
appropriations of ₱ 335,487,000.00 for Gender and Development planned programs 

and projects. The GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for the year was prepared; however, 

it was not duly endorsed by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), as 

required in PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01. Moreover, GAD-related 

activities and expenditures could not be verified and reviewed as no GAD 

Accomplishment Report was submitted. 
 



70 

  

108. COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 provides that “The Audited 
agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit 

Team assigned to the agency within five (5) working days from the receipt of the 

approved plan from the PCW or their mother or central offices, as the case may be. 

Likewise, a copy of the corresponding Accomplishment Report shall be furnished the 

said Audit Team within five (5) working days from the end of January of the preceding 

year”. 

 

109. Moreover, the PCW/NEDA/DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 on the Guidelines for 
the Preparation of Annual Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Budgets and 

Accomplishment Reports to Implement the Magna Carta of Women, prescribes 

guidelines and procedures for the formulation, development, submission, 

implementation, monitoring, and evaluation including accounting of results of agency 

annual GAD plans and budgets (GPBs), and GAD accomplishment reports (AR), 

providing the following: 

 

 6.0 Costing and Allocation of the GAD Budget 

 

  6.4 Attributing agency major programs to the GAD 

budget.   

   Attribution to the GAD budget of a portion or the 

whole of    the budget of an agency’s major 

programs is a means    toward gradually 

increasing the gender responsiveness of   

 government programs and budgets. 

 

 6.4.1 If an agency intends to attribute a portion or the 

whole budget of major programs during the GAD 

planning and budgeting phase, it may subject the 

program to gender analysis using the Harmonized 

 Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) tool. 

If the agency is not yet trained on the use of  the tool, it 

may include said training in its GPB and may seek the 

assistance of an expert on gender analysis using the 

HGDG. 

 

 6.4.2 The use of the HGDG will yield a maximum score 

of 20 points for each program or project. Depending on 

the score on the HGDG, a percentage of the budget of the 

agency’s existing and proposed major program may be 

attributed to the GAD budget as follows:

 10.0 Preparation and Submission of GAD Accomplishment 

Reports 

 

  10.1 xxx.  The agency GFPS shall prepare the annual 

GAD AR  based on the PCW-endorsed GPB or the GPB 

adjusted to the approved GAA xxx. 

 

110. In response to this requirement, the GPB was formulated, where it allocated 
₱400,000.00 for four (4) identified gender issues, and ₱72,913,500.00 for one (1) 

attributed program, totaling ₱73,313,500.00, equivalent to 22% of its total appropriations 

of ₱335,487,000.00, significantly greater than five percent (5%) as required in the Joint 

Circular. Relevant details, taken from the GPB, are as follows:

111. The planned GAD activities for the year comprised of various undertakings, as well 
as one program, the cost of which was attributed to the GAD budget. Said program was 

subject to gender analysis using the HGDG tool, with the details as follows:

112. In response to the requirement of the Joint Circular, an Annual GAD Plan and 
Budget (GPB) for FY 2020 was prepared and formulated that would address gender-

related issues/problems within the Agency through the effort of its GAD Focal Point 

System (GFPS) Technical Working Group. A copy of the GPB was submitted to this 

office; however, no endorsement by the PCW was apparent on the said copy. 

 

113. Contrary to COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014, no copy of the 
GAD Accomplishment Report was furnished to this office. Upon inquiry, we noted that 

the said report was still under review of the PCW. 

 

114. The failure to submit the GAD Accomplishment Report precluded the assessment 
of whether the appropriated budget for ASTI was effectively utilized in the 

implementation of gender issues and whether the determination of the identified policies, 

programs, projects and activities address the gender concerns of the ASTI employees. 

 

115. We recommended and Management agreed that the GFPS: 
 

a. comply with the provisions of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 
2012-01 as to the preparation and submission of its GPB to secure the 

PCW’s endorsement prior to its implementation, and continue complying 

with the corresponding activities supporting GAD plans and programs at 

five percent (5%) of the total agency budget appropriations; and 

 

b. promptly submit to the Audit Team the GAD Plan and Budget within the 
prescribed period as well as its Accomplishment Report for the timely 

COA annual audit pursuant to COA Circular No. 2014-001,  PCW-NEDA-

DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01, and related PCW Memorandum 

Circulars issued annually. 

 

116. Management informed that the Agency has duly complied with the deadlines set by 
the PCW on the submission of the GPB. Based on the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring 

System (GMMS) history, DOST-ASTI was able to encode and submit the GPB to the 

PCW on September 13, 2019 and this was returned on October 9, 2019 for revision. The 

revised GPB was once again returned on January 23, 2020 for a second revision. DOST-

ASTI complied with the deadline and submitted the revised document on February 5, 

2020; however, the GPB was tagged as “unendorsed” by the PCW because the agency’s 

GPB has already reached the number of submissions which is consistent with the internal 

review process of the PCW.

117. DOST-ASTI was able to encode and submit the 2020 GAR to PCW through the 
GMMS on March 12, 2021, which is in compliance with the set deadline of the PCW. On 

April 1, 2021, the PCW returned the document and instructed the agency to revise the 

2020 GAR and submit on or before May 5, 2021. The agency was able to submit on May 

4, 2021 which was before the deadline set. The revised GAR is currently under review of 

the PCW. 

 

Programs and Projects Related to Senior Citizens and Differently-Abled Person 

 

118. The Agency complied with the required programs and projects related to 
Senior Citizens and differently-abled persons for CY 2020 

 

119. Section 32 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act of 2020 - 
Programs and Projects Related to Senior Citizens and Persons with disability provides 

that “All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects 

intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and person with disability, in so far as 

it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities. 

 

120. Moreover, all government facilities, including infrastructure, non-infrastructure 
and civil works projects of the government, as well as office buildings, streets and 

highways shall provide architectural or structural features, designs, or facilities that will 

reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability pursuant 

to B.P. Blg.  344 and R.A. No. 7277.” 

 

121. Currently, ASTI has Senior Citizen and differently-abled person provisions such as 
PWD entrance ramp, PWD-ready restrooms, and PWD/Senior Citizen courtesy lanes (for 

pregnant women as well). 

 

122. As for programs/projects that cater to senior citizens/PWD, ASTI does not have 
specific programs/projects but it implemented policies like work-from-home arrangement 

to ensure the safety of the staff, especially staff who are senior citizens. The preferred 

schedule of the senior citizen staff is prioritized. 

 

123. As for the PWD, it is worthy to note that the Human Resource Merit Promotion and 
Selection Board (HRMPSB) considered appointing a PWD applicant to a vacant position, 

but did not push through as the applicant is no longer interested. 

 

124. We commended Management for complying with the required programs and 
projects related to the Senior Citizens and differently-abled persons.
