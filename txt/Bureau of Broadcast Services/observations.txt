OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Financial and Compliance 
 

Collections not issued with BBS Official Receipts 

 

1. The collection of airtime or advertising fees undertaken by BBS Radio Stations 
DWFR Bontoc, Mt. Province and DZRK Tabuk City, Kalinga based on a 

Tripartite Memorandum of Agreement, between the BBS, BBS Employees 

Association (BBSEA) and BBS Multi-Purpose Cooperative (BBSMPC) was not in 

consonance with government rules and regulations on collections prescribed in PD 

No. 1445.  

 

Sections 68 and 69, Chapter 3 of the PD No. 1445 provide:  

 

Section 68 - No payment of any nature shall be received by a 

collecting officer without immediately issuing an official receipt in 

acknowledgment thereof.   

 

Section 69 - Public officers authorized to receive and collect moneys 

arising from taxes, revenues, or receipts of any kind shall remit or deposit 

intact the full amounts so received and collected by them to the treasury of 

the agency concerned and credited to the particular accounts to which the 

said moneys belong.   

 

The Audit Team conducted examination on the cash and accounts of DZEQ 

Baguio City Station’s accountable officer as of October 19, 2020. Reports of 

Collections and Deposits submitted by the DWFR Bontoc and DZRK Tabuk City radio 

stations as of December 31, 2020 were also reviewed by the Audit Team, pending the 

conduct of cash examination due to travel restrictions and COVID 19 pandemic. 

 

For CY 2020, collections of the three radio stations aggregated to ₱1,361,395.00. 

Of the total collections, 89 percent or ₱1,217,520.00 were airtime and advertising fees 

from the DWFR Bontoc and DZRK Tabuk City stations which were collected by 

BBSMPC using its receipt and deposited to its account of the, as summarized below: 

 

Station Amount (P) Depository Account  

DZEQ Baguio City 143,875.00 Bureau of Treasury (BTr) 

DWFR Bontoc, Mountain Province 1,188,520.00 BBSMPC 

DZRK Tabuk City, Kalinga  29,000.00 BBSMPC 

Total collections and deposits to 

BBSMPC 
1,217,520.00  

Total Collections 1,361,395.00  

 

It was observed that different procedures were undertaken by the stations in the 

collection and remittance of airtime and advertising fees. The DZEQ Baguio radio 



29 

 

station acknowledged the amount collected by issuing the BBS OR, Form No. 51-C. to 

paying clients and deposited the same to the account of the BTr, consistent to the 

general rules on collection of government funds provided in PD No. 1445.  

 

On the other hand, collections of the DWFR Bontoc and DZRK Tabuk radio 

stations, were acknowledged by issuing OR of the BBSMPC. The collections are 

deposited to the Land Bank account of the cooperative, and any bank charges for inter-

branch deposits are deducted from the collections. 

 

In response to the Audit Team’s query, the station managers cited that the 

station’s collection process is based on a Tripartite MOA entered into among the : (a) 

BBS Central Office (CO), represented by its Director; (b) BBS Employees 

Organization (BBSEO), an accredited public sector labor union, represented by its 

president; and (c) BBSMPC, a non-governmental organization duly registered and 

accredited with the Cooperative Development Authority, operated by the BBS 

employees BBS as COOP  members, represented by the Chairman. The agreement 

became effective on November 13, 2018 up to December 31, 2021.  

 

As stated in the Tripartite MOA, BBS recognizes the UNION thru the COOP to 

be the marketing arm of the agency and authorizes the BBSMPC (herein referred also 

as cooperative) to be the marketing/production arm for airtime sale in all the Agency’s 

radio stations, the following responsibilities of the cooperative were enumerated as 

follows: 

 

a. Enter into and prepare contract with the AGENCY for the purchase of 

airtime and government/private entities that utilize its services as a marketing 

and/or production arm; 

 

b. Enter into agreement with government agencies and private entities that will 

utilize its services as marketing and/or production arm; 

c.     Act as the collecting agent to ensure timely and accurate payment from 

clients; and 

 

d. Ensure timely and equitable distribution of pre-agreed shares to concerned 

parties. 

 

Anent, signatories in the contracts/MOA for airtime sales in the DWFR Bontoc 

and DZRK Kalinga stations included the Chairperson of the BBSMPC and the station 

manager. In contrast, contract/MOA entered into by DZEQ Baguio were not coursed 

through the BBSMPC chairperson but were signed by the BBS Director and the station 

manager. 

 

We were informed that in terms of airtime rates, Baguio City Station charges the 

regular airtime rates provided by BBS, while for the Bontoc and Kalinga stations, 

additional charge is added on top of the regular rates billed to clients in Bontoc and 

Kalinga stations. After which, the COOP accounts for the collections and immediately 



30 

 

remits/distributes to the BBS and the stations in accordance with a pre-agreed sharing 

scheme. We are not able to validate this process due to limited access to accounting 

records at the Audit Team’s end. 

 

The antecedents in the Tripartite MOA stated that the Agency, Union and Coop 

agreed to the terms as a means to augment the meager financial resources of BBS 

employees as mandated by their respective missions and visions and/or by-laws, and 

the Collective Negotiations Agreement (CNA) to uphold the well-being of all BBS 

employees. They recognized that the broadcast resources of the Bureau can be 

maximized to ensure the financial well-being of the BBS employees, hence, the pre-

agreed sharing of premiums. The documentary attachments to the MOA submitted to 

the Audit Team however, do not clearly show the participation of the COOP, in the 

marketing and production of airtime sales in Bontoc and Tabuk City, being the 

marketing arm of the agency. 

 

Though the process undertaken by the Bontoc and Tabuk radio stations was 

based on the Tripartite MOA, the Audit Team stands by the general rule provided in 

P.D. 1445 on collection of government revenues. The sale of airtime is by virtue of 

government law and revenues are generated out of government resources. The 

collection of airtime or advertising fees is part of the regular functions of the station’s 

personnel and accountable officers being employees of the BBS. Hence, airtime sales 

collections shall be duly acknowledged with the government’s OR and immediately 

remitted to the BTr.  

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. review the existing collection processes and streamline collection 
procedures among all radio stations that is aligned with the government 

rules on collection and deposit of government funds/revenue, particularly 

on the immediate acknowledgement of collections using government 

official receipt and deposit to the Bureau of Treasury. 

 

b. explain what is the participation of the BBSMPC in the marketing and 
production of airtime sales in BBS-Bontoc and Kalinga stations in 

contrast to the Baguio City Station.  

 

Management Comments: 

 

As borne by the records, to date, as stated in the Tripartite MOA, BBS recognizes 

the BBSEO thru the BBSMPC to be the marketing/production arm for the airtime sale 

in all the Bureau’s radio stations, to wit: 

 

a. Enter into and prepare contract with the Agency for the purchase of airtime 
and government/private entities that utilize its services as a marketing and/or 

production arm; 

 



31 

 

b. Enter into agreement with the government agencies and private entities that 
will utilize its services as a marketing and /or production arm; 

c. Act as the collecting agent to ensure timely and accurate payment from 
clients; and 

 

d. Ensure timely and equitable distribution of pre-agreed shares to concerned 

parties. 

 

Verily, this is supported by the CNA between the BBS and BBS Employees 

Organization (BBSEO) as stated in Sections 11 and 12 Article IX of the CNA to wit: 

 

Section 11. The AGENCY shall accredit the UNION through its 

economic arm, the Bureau of Broadcast Services Multi-Purpose Cooperative 

(BBSMPC) to be the marketing arm of the AGENCY subject to applicable 

laws, rules and regulations. 

 

Section 12. To put this into operation, the AGENCY and the UNION 

shall forge a sales marketing contract entitling the Bureau of Broadcast 

Services Multi-Purpose Cooperative (BBSMPC) to collect the standard 

broadcast industry sales commission or its equivalent, after which, net of 

administrative cost shall be divided equally among UNION members at the 

end of each year. 

 

In accordance with this, the UNION shall encourage the BBSMPC to be active in 

marketing the BBS facilities and services, subject to pertinent COA and DBM rules 

and regulations. 

 

The Agency agrees to grant special rates to the BBSMPC for added resource 

generation, for the benefit of all member-employee. 

 

Moreover, the Agency allows the BBSMPC to undertake BBS projects that 

would enable member-employees to have a share in the resource generated, such as 

projects that shall utilize the expertise of member-employees and subject to availability 

of funds and applicable laws, rules and regulations. 

 

The CNA is submitted and duly registered at the Cooperative Development 

Authority (CDA) and Civil Service Commission (CSC), and in the absence of any 

adverse comment or action from these Agencies, we can now assume that Bontoc and 

Tabuk Stations simply implemented in good faith the Tripartite Agreement which 

derived its legal basis from the duly registered CNA. 

 

In addition, the PBS-BBS Sales and Marketing Policies Memorandum Order No. 

013 approved and signed by no less than Presidential Communications Operations 

Office (PCOO) Secretary Jose Ruperto Martin M. Andanar is the Implementing Rules 

and Regulations (IRR) for the PBS-BBS organic law and was duly published in the 



32 

 

Official Gazette and duly registered at UP Law Center for National Archive of 

Administrative Order hence, has the legal force and effect of law.  

 

Verily, the PBS-BBS undoubtedly an administrative agency has power to 

formulate and interpret its foregoing rules which have the force and effect of law, and 

such an interpretation becomes part of the rule (Geukekovs. Hon. Araneta, etc., G. R. 

No.  L-10182, Dec.24, 1957, citing Foley vs. Benedict, 122 Tex 193, 55 SW [2d] 805, 

86 ALR 477). Rules, regulations, and general orders enacted by administrative 

authorities of the PBS BBS pursuant to the powers delegated to them have the force 

and effect of law (Geukeko vs. Hon. Araneta, etc., supra. Citing Columbia 

Broadcasting System vs. United States, 87, L. Ed. [Adv. 1066]).  The contemporaneous 

construction of statute (and similarly of rules and regulations) by the executive officers 

of the PBS BBS whose duty it is to execute it is entitled to great respect, and should 

ordinarily control the construction of the statute by the courts (Geukeko vs. Hon. 

Araneta, etc.,  supra. citing United States vs. Philrock, 120 U.S. 52, 30 L Ed. 559). 

Hence, courts, in this case this Honorable COA are reluctant to disregard a settled 

practice of an executive department where they are not satisfied that it is contrary to 

law, and are satisfied that it is in accordance with justice and good faith (Geukeko vs. 

Hon. Araneta, etc., supra. citing Grant vs. Raymond, 8 L Ed. 376). 

 

Time and again the Honorable Supreme Court have consistently ruled that 

specific legislation (PBS BBS Charter and its IRR) upon a particular subject is not 

affected by a general law (cited by the Honorable Auditors) upon the same subject 

unless it clearly appears that the provision of the two laws are so repugnant that the 

legislature must have intended by the later to modify or repeal the earlier legislation. 

The special act and the general law must stand together, the one as the law of the 

particular subject and the other as the general law of the land. (Lichauco, etc. vs 

Apostol, etc., et al., G. R. No. L-19628, Dec. 4, 1922 citing Ex Parte United States, 226 

U. S., 420; 57 L. ed., 281; Ex Parte Crow Dog, 109 U. S., 556; 27 L. ed., 1030; Partee 

vs. St. Louis & S. F. R. Co., 204 Fed. Rep., 970). 

 

As a final note, Article 62 (10) of RA 9520 otherwise known as The Philippine 

Cooperative Code of 2008 provides “Cooperative transacting business with the 

Government of the Philippines or any of its political subdivisions or any of its agencies 

or instrumentalities, including government owned and controlled corporations shall be 

exempt from prequalification bidding requirements notwithstanding the provisions of 

Republic Act No. 9184, otherwise known as, the Government Procurement Act. 

 

As to alleged difference in collection procedures and rates between DZEQ 

Baguio and DWFR Bontoc and DZRK Tabuk, there is nothing irregular or illegal in the 

alleged difference in collection procedure and rates. It is also not a violation of audit 

rules and procedures of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009. It is a mere marketing 

variation. 

 

With respect to DZEQ Baguio, the advertiser directly contracted with the station 

meaning it was not through the marketing efforts of BBSEO or BBSMPC. 



33 

 

Accordingly, DZEQ Baguio charged BBS standard rate card of BBS and 

acknowledged payments by issuing government official receipt form (Form No. 51-C) 

and deposited with the Bureau of Treasury because these are public funds. 

 

On the other hand, the advertisers for DWFR Bontoc and DZRK Tabuk being the 

result of the marketing efforts of airtime by BBSEO and BBSMPC, the latter 

acknowledged payments by issuing BBSMPC official receipts to the advertiser based 

on its established rates not lower than BBS’ standard rate card. Due to the contractual 

nature between the advertiser and BBSMPC, payments are not considered public funds 

but rather private funds of the employees’ organization and/or cooperative, therefore 

not subject of government auditing requirement. 

 

Thus, all told, subject transactions subject of the foregoing AOM are governed by 

rules and laws of special application to the PBS BBS which were duly complied with, 

and which laws and rules are particularly legally applicable to the cited transactions. 

 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team maintains their stand that collections from airtime sales are 

public funds pursuant to Executive Order (EO) No. 297 series of 1087, Section 18, as 

follows: 

 

Section 18.  Transitory Measures.  The BBS and the Philippine 

News Agency are authorized to sell their services at rates not less than 

those offered by comparable private firms, Provided, That income 

realized shall be deposited with the National Treasury and shall accrue to 

the General Fund; Provided, further, That income realized shall be used 

to upgrade and update facilities, equipment, and services, and to augment 

maintenance and other operating expenses for network operations, upon 

submission of a special budget shall be subjected to the approval of the 

Department of Budget and Management. 

 

The BBS-DWFR Bontoc, Mt. Province and DZRK Tabuk City, Kalinga, being a 

government entity, utilizes government facilities, equipment and man power to 

produce airtime and generate sales revenue. 

 

As observed in audit, collection of receivables and deposit of collections are 

performed by Management and Accountable Officer of the stations as part of their 

regular functions as employees of BBS while on official duty.  

 

Further, based on collection reports, majority of the advertisers were government 

agencies that directly availed the station’s airtime services without marketing efforts 

from the BBS.  Hence, the collections are governed by the rules and regulations of the 

COA and the Bureau of Treasury.  

 



34 

 

Meanwhile, due to the Audit Team’s limited scope of audit and access to 

accounting records; and since the two radio stations’ action was based on a Tripartite 

Memorandum of Agreement signed between the Official of BBSEO and BBSMPC 

based in BBS Central Office, PIA Building, Visayas Avenue, Quezon City, we deemed 

it proper to forward your comments and our audit rejoinder to the Supervising Auditor 

and Audit Team Leader of the BBS Central Office who has audit jurisdiction therein 

for a more comprehensive evaluation and consideration in the audit of the accounts. 

 

 

Accountability for collections not covered by bond 

 

2. The Accountable Officers accountability for collections, which ranged from ₱3,000 
to ₱200,000.00 daily, from airing of plugs and advertisements in radio stations 

DWFR Bondoc, DZRK Tabuk and DZEQ Baguio City were not covered by 

fidelity bond as required in Treasury Circular No. 02-2009, to the disadvantage of 

the BBS, in case of loss. 

 

Fidelity Bond is an insurance under the Fidelity Fund to assure for losses of 

government funds in cases of defalcations, shortages and unrelieved accountabilities of 

an official up to actual loss but not exceeding the amount of bond.  

 

Section 5.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 provides that the amount of bond 

shall be based on the total accountability (cash, property and accountable forms) of the 

accountable public officer as determined by the Head of Agency. Annex C of the same 

Circular specified the premium rates, the corresponding minimum and maximum cash 

accountability and amount of bond for effective bonding of Accountable Officers.  

 

The BBS central office takes charge of the application for renewal of fidelity 

bond of its accountable officer nation-wide. Perusal of the BTr’s Confirmation Letters, 

showed that the approved bond of the station’s accountable officers was only for the 

accountability for the station’s petty cash fund, their accountability for collections was 

not covered. Records show that daily collections held by the AO ranged from ₱3,000 to 

₱200,000.00 for Bontoc and Tabuk, and P202,875.00 for Baguio collected from airing 

of plugs and advertisements. 

 

Since reimbursement from the Fidelity Fund is up to the extent of the approved 

bond covered or amount of loss whichever is lower, increasing the amount of bond 

according to the station’s actual cash on hand balances is imperative to provide 

sufficient insurance coverage, in case of loss.  

 

We recommended that Management increase the amount of fidelity bond 

with the Bureau of Treasury of the Accountable Officers of radio stations which 

cash accountability include not only for petty cash fund, but other collections from 

selling of airtime and advertisements.  

 



35 

 

Management insisted that the collections are private funds therefore it is not 

subject to Fidelity Bond. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

We maintain on our stand that collections for payment of airtime is a public fund; 

therefore, requires the accountable officer to be bonded. 

 

 

Delayed deposit of collections  

 

3. Collections were not deposited within the prescribed period with delays ranging 
from three to 33 days, thereby exposing government funds to loss and misuse. 

 

Verification and analysis of collections and deposits of the AO of DZEQ, Baguio 

for the period September 7, 2019 to October 19, 2020 disclosed that on several 

occasions, daily collections were not promptly deposited within the prescribed period, 

with delays ranging from three to 33 working days, as shown below:

09/04/20 39,375.00 09/07/20 10/21/20 33 

Total 202,875.00    

 

 The delayed deposits of collections resulted in the accumulation of funds in the 

AO’s possession ranging from P3,000.00 to P39,375.00. 

 

The AO during the initial discussion of observations explained that the delays 

were due to backlog of office works and quarantine restrictions due to the COVID 19 

pandemic.  It was noted however, that the delays were evident even prior to the 

pandemic period and it was aggravated during the quarantine period.  

 

Considering practicality, the COA in its Revised Cash Examination Manual 

further provided that “Where collections are minimal and daily deposit thereof 



36 

 

becomes costly and impractical, the Collecting Officers shall deposit their collections 

at least once a week, or as soon as the collections reach P10,000.00.”  

 

The deposit of collections within the prescribed period aims to deter the 

accumulation of public funds in the custody of the collecting officer to safeguard public 

funds from risk of loss or possible misappropriation considering also that collections 

were not covered by the fidelity bond of the AO, as discussed in the preceding 

observation. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the AO to deposit 

her/his collections daily or not later than the next banking day with the 

Authorized Government Depository Bank in accordance with the existing rules 

and regulations. 

 

 

Unreliable PPE account balance 

 

4. The accuracy, validity and existence of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) 
with total acquisition cost of P402,989,228.72 could not be relied upon due to:             

a) discrepancy of P976,257.88 between the accounting records and Report on 

Physical Count of PPE (RCPPE) due non reconciliation of these records; b) 

absence of report of lost properties amounting to P251,358.08; and c) ownership 

or title of donated land 26 years ago valued at P4,238,000.00 remained with the 

donor; and d) unserviceable properties amounting to P36,807,381.88 were not yet 

disposed contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 1445.  

 

Some of the accounting policies and standards with regard to PPE, as provided in 

Chapter 10 GAM, Volume I, are shown below:  
 

 The PPELC shall be reconciled with the Report on the Physical Count of the 
PPE, PC and the control accounts. Any discrepancies shall be immediately 

verified and adjusted. 
 

 Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count 
shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper 

accounting/recording. 
 

 Lost property and the related accumulated depreciation and impairment loss 
shall be derecognized in the books upon receipt of the Report of Lost, Stolen, 

Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) supported by a Notice of Loss 

prepare and submitted by the Accountable Officer. The loss shall be charged 

to account “Loss of Assets” at an amount equal to its carrying amount. 

 

 The accountability of the accountable officer over the loss of depreciable 
asset shall be based on depreciated replacement cost (DRC) PPSAS 21 par. 



37 

 

45. DRC is replacement cost less accumulated depreciation calculated on the 

basis of replacement cost. 

 

 A receivable account shall be set up to record the accountability of the 
accountable officer simultaneous with derecognition of the lost PPE. 

Moreover, Section 73 (1) of PD No. 1445 provides that: 

 

When a loss of government funds or property occurs while they are in 

transit or the loss is caused by fire, theft, or other casualty or force 

majeure, the officer accountable therefore or having custody thereof 

shall immediately notify the Commission or the auditor concerned 

and, within thirty days or such longer period as the Commission or 

auditor may in the particular case allow, shall present his application 

for relief, with the available supporting evidence. Whenever warranted 

by the evidence credit for the loss shall be allowed. An officer who 

fails to comply with this requirement shall not be relieved of liability 

or allowed credit for any loss in the settlement of his accounts.  

 

a. Discrepancy in the balance per books and RPCPPE 
 

Comparison of the balances of the following PPE accounts per books and the 

RPCPPE showed a total discrepancy of P976,257.88 which was due to the difference in 

the value of some PPE, recorded properties not included in the RPCPPE, items found 

during the physical count but not recorded in the books and double entry in the 

RPCPPE. The details are presented below.

Those properties that were not reflected in the RPCPPE may be considered 

lost/missing or had been inadvertently not included/considered during the physical 

count.   

 

The discrepancy indicated the lack of reconciliation of records between the 

Accounting and Property Sections.  

 

 Further verification of the RPCPPE against PPE Ledger Cards (PPELC) 

revealed, that there were 21 PPE items which have different property numbers and 

three PPE items without property numbers, details are as follows:

The deficient PPE control tag/sticker may result in accountability issues in the 

event of damage and/or loss of the assets, and indicates weak internal control in 

monitoring of the agency’s assets, as each PPE should have a unique property number 

distinct from the others.  

 

b. Lost properties not reported in the Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged or Destroyed 
Property (RLSDDP) 

  

Lost properties totaling P251,358.08 were still recorded in the books, as follows: 

 

Account Description  Unit Cost  (P) Qty Total (P)

Total 7 251,358.08  

 

Per inquiry, some of the equipment were lost due to flood while the others were 

left in the area after the coverage.  

 

Accordingly, due to omission of entry for the lost PPE, the corresponding 

receivable account from the end-user/accountable officer who may be held liable 

therefor was not recognized in the books. 

 

Records show that the required RLSDDP and Notice of Loss were not submitted 

to the Audit Team.  

  

c.   Doubtful land ownership 
 

The rights and obligations assertion is a basic assertion that the agency owns and 

has the ownership/usage rights to all assets reported in its financial statement.   

 

Recorded under the Land account is the lot located at Kalinga, Apayao with zonal 

value of P2,025,000.00 which was acquired by the BSS in September 1994 through 

donation.  Examination of title documents/deeds showed that despite the lapse of 26 

years, the title to said property has yet to be transferred to BBS as the covering TCT 

No. T-17738 is still under the name of the donor.  

 

Likewise, the transfer of ownership of the donated land located at Carcar, Cebu 

with TCT No. 82306, recorded at P2,213,000.00, has yet to be effected in the name of 

BBS.    

 

The absence of land title in the name of BBS casts doubt on its ownership rights 

over said properties.  

 

d.     Unserviceable properties not yet disposed 
 

Properties to be considered idle, unserviceable and fully depreciated shall be 

when the (a) future benefits are consumed not only through usage but also through 

obsolescence and wear and tear; (b) the carrying amount is equal to zero or residual 

value; and (c) it is no longer capable of providing the entity with future economic 

benefits or service potential. 

 

Section 79 of PD No. 1445 is quoted below: 

 

When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, 

or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer 

accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his 

duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned 



40 

 

and, if found to be valueless or unsaleable, it may be destroyed in their 

presence. If found valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the 

highest bidder xxx. 

 

While Section 40, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM provides that:  

 

All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and 

Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP).  PPE reported 

in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment 

Loss- Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less 

Accumulated Depreciation). 

 

The RPCPPE included unserviceable properties totaling P36,807,381.88 which, 

however, were not reported in the IIRUP, with details below:

Total 402,989,228.72 36,807,381.88 9.13% 

 

The unserviceable PPE were stored in the warehouse of the Regional Radio 

Stations under the custody of the respective Supply and Property Officer and Station 

Managers.  

 

The delayed disposal exposes the unserviceable properties to further 

deterioration, and deprives the government of any benefit/income that can be derived 

from their sale, not to mention the benefit of utilizing the occupied space that would be 

freed for other purposes. 

 

We recommended that Management require: 

 

a.   The Accountant to: (i) record in the books those PPE that were found at 

station during the physical count; and (ii) derecognize the cost of lost 

properties and accordingly, set up a receivable account from the end-

user/ accountable officer named in the corresponding Property 

Acknowledgment Receipt; 

 



41 

 

b.   The Property Officer to: (i) locate/produce those recorded properties not 

included in the RPCPPE; and (ii) prepare IIRUP for the unserviceable 

properties and submit the same to the Disposal Committee for 

appropriate action;  

 

c.  The Accounting and Property Section to periodically reconcile their 

records; 

 

d.   The Inventory Committee to: (i) ensure that the result of physical count 

is reconciled with the accounting records, and that the discrepancy, if 

any, is accordingly and promptly acted upon; and (ii) include all PPE in 

the physical count; 

 

e.  The Disposal Committee to immediately undertake the appropriate 

disposal of unserviceable PPE;   

 

f.  The accountable officer/end-user of the lost properties to prepare the 

RLSDDP and submit the same, duly supported with documents, to the 

Accounting and Property Sections, and Audit Team; and 

 

g.    The responsible office to cause the titling/transfer of title of the donated 

land in the name of BBS to assert its ownership over said properties.   

 

Management committed to adhere to the team’s recommendations and to 

formulate an internal guideline on the disposal of its unserviceable property and 

equipment to establish procedure and control systems governing proper disposition of 

unserviceable properties while defining the roles and functions of the 

stations/units/committees involved in the process of the property disposal.  

Accordingly, the Management will proceed with the disposal once the internal 

guidelines has been finalized and approved.  

 

 

Non-submission of weekly progress reports  

 

5. Of the P25.2 million fund transferred for the implementation of the Philippine 
Identification System (PhilSys) project, a total of P14.8 million had already been 

disbursed for the procurement of event organizer of which the required weekly 

progress report was not submitted to the Source Agency as inputs to its project 

monitoring and reporting system as required under the Memorandum of 

Agreement.    

 

On April 8, 2019, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) and the Presidential 

Communication Operations Office (PCOO) entered into a MOA where PCOO and its 

attached agencies, including the BBS, shall develop and produce the multimedia 

communications requirements for the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys).   

 



42 

 

In a separate MOA between the PCOO and BBS dated September 27, 21019, 

PCOO has tasked BBS the following responsibilities: 

 

a. Manage, monitor, and execute, together with the PSA and PCOO, the 

implementation of the services and ensure completion of the project in 

accordance with the Communications Plan of the PCOO and PSA. 

 

b. Conceptualize and develop radio advertisements and other such analogous 

materials for the PhilSys Campaign. 

c. Provide radio spots/placements for the IEC materials of the PhilSys 

Campaign. 

 

d. Assist and provide logistics support to the PCOO, PSA and PIA in the 

conduct of the roadshows, media forums and other such analogous events 

under the Communications Plan of the PCOO and PSA. 

 

e. Conduct its own campus tours in support of the PhilSys Campaign.  In light 

of the shift to a more digital-focused campaign, this campus tour has shifted 

to a digital campus tour. 

 

f. Liquidate to the PCOO, on a monthly basis, all expenses made in relation to 

the execution of activities in the MOA. 

 

g. Submit to the PCOO, on a weekly basis, progress reports for work or 

projects undertaken relative to the execution of the activities stated in the 

MOA. 

 

h. Submit to the PCOO, a comprehensive report on all accomplishments of the 

BBS at the end of the effectivity of the MOA. 

 

i. Return to the PCOO any remaining or unutilized balance of the fund transfer 

after the end of the effectivity of the MOA, and 

 

j. Perform such other functions and duties as may be necessary or incidental to 

its functions hereunder, subject to mutual agreement of the parties. 

 

While the PCOO, as the Source Agency, shall provide BBS the necessary budget 

amounting to P50,400,000.00 for the execution of its undertakings under the MOA 

which shall be released in tranches.  

 

In February 2020, BBS received NCA-BMB-C-20-0001751 in the amount of 

P25,200,000.00 representing the first tranche of the funds transferred by PCOO.   

 

It was gathered that during the period under audit, BBS had already undertaken 

some activities for the PhilSys Campaign such as conceptualization of the content and 



43 

 

development of other materials for the radio advertisements, conduct of public bidding 

for the procurement of event organizer and award of the related contract.   

 

Review of disbursement records showed that BBS had already utilized the 

amount of P14,878,000.00 as of December 31, 2020, leaving a balance of 

P10,322,000.00 

 

 The Audit Team requested for copy of the BBS accomplishment/progress reports 

for its assigned activities that were submitted to PCOO.  However, what were provided 

to the Audit Team were copy of animated ads, interview questionnaire, video tapes and 

other materials for airing. There was no report submitted that would show the project 

status or percentage of completion of the BBS planned activities.  Also, BBS could not 

provide the implementation plan showing the target activities and the corresponding 

timelines/target completion date.  

 

The progress report is a tool needed by the PCOO to properly monitor and assess 

the works/activities being undertaken by BBS over a certain period relative to the 

implementation of the PhilSys Communications Plan so that problems/issues, if any, 

could be immediately addressed. It also guides PCOO in its decision-making for the 

release of additional funds to BBS.   

 

Under the amended MOA, BBS is required to submit a weekly progress report to 

PCOO.  

 

We recommended that Management encourage the Focal Project Head of 

the PhilSys Campaign Project to regularly inform the PCOO the weekly progress 

of the project as required in the amended MOA.   

 

The BBS Focal Project Head, PhilSys Campaign Project adhered to the audit 

recommendation and has already been preparing a weekly progress report and 

submitting the same to PCOO as required in the amended MOA.   

 

 

B. Other Areas 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) Plan and Program  

6. Management formulated GAD plans and programs to boost the level of awareness on 
gender issues and promotes gender equality among BBS personnel incurring total 

expenses of P24,313,570.00. 

 

Evaluation of the GAD accomplishments for CY 2020 showed that the following 

planned activities were executed, and that a total amount of P24,313,570.00 was spent 

for that purpose, as presented below:
