regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the significant audit observations and corresponding 

recommendations, details of which are discussed in Part II of this report.  

Management views and comments were incorporated in the report, where 

appropriate.  

 

1. The collection of airtime or advertising fees undertaken by BBS Radio Stations 
DWFR Bontoc, Mt. Province and DZRK Tabuk City, Kalinga based on a 

Tripartite Memorandum of Agreement, between the BBS, BBS Employees 

Association (BBSEA) and BBS Multi-Purpose Cooperative (BBSMPC) was  

not in consonance with government rules and regulations on collections 

prescribed in PD No. 1445.  (Paragraph no. 1) 

 

We recommended that Management:  

 

a. review the existing collection processes and streamline collection 

procedures among all radio stations that is aligned with the government 

rules on collection and deposit of government funds/revenue, particularly 

on the immediate acknowledgement of collections using government 

official receipt and deposit to the Bureau of Treasury. 

 

b. explain what is the participation of the BBSMPC in the marketing and 

production of airtime sales in BBS-Bontoc and Kalinga stations in contrast

to the Baguio City Station.  

 

2. The Accountable Officers accountability for collections, which ranged from 
₱3,000 to ₱200,000.00 daily, from airing of plugs and advertisements in radio 

stations DWFR Bondoc, DZRK Tabuk and DZEQ Baguio City were not 

covered by fidelity bond as required in Treasury Circular No. 02-2009, to the 

disadvantage of the BBS, in case of loss. (Paragraph no. 2) 

 

We recommended that Management increase the amount of fidelity bond with 

the Bureau of Treasury of the Accountable Officers of radio stations which 

cash accountability include not only for petty cash fund, but other collections 

from selling of airtime and advertisements.  

 

3. Collections were not deposited within the prescribed period with delays 
ranging from three to 33 days, thereby exposing government funds to loss and 

misuse. (Paragraph no. 3) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountable Officer 

to deposit her/his collections daily or not later than the next banking day with 

the Authorized Government Depository Bank in accordance with the existing 

rules and regulations. 

 

4. The accuracy, validity and existence of the Property, Plant and Equipment 
(PPE) with total acquisition cost of P402,989,228.72 could not be relied upon 

due to: a) discrepancy of P976,257.88 between the accounting records and 

Report on Physical Count of PPE (RCPPE) due non reconciliation of these 

records; b) absence of report of lost properties amounting to P251,358.08; and 

c) ownership or title of donated land 26 years ago valued at P4,238,000.00 

remained with the donor; and d) unserviceable properties amounting to 

P36,807,381.88 were not yet disposed contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 1445. 

(Paragraph no. 4) 

 

We recommended that Management require: 

 

a. The Accountant to: (i) record in the books those PPE that were found at 
station during the physical count; and (ii) derecognize the cost of lost 

properties and accordingly, set up a receivable account from the end-user/ 

accountable officer named in the corresponding Property Acknowledgment 

Receipt; 

 

b. The Property Officer to: (i) locate/produce those recorded properties not 
included in the RPCPPE; and (ii) prepare IIRUP for the unserviceable 

properties and submit the same to the Disposal Committee for appropriate 

action;  

 

c. The Accounting and Property Section to periodically reconcile their   



v 

 

records; 

 

d. The Inventory Committee to: (i) ensure that  the result of physical count is 
reconciled with the accounting records, and that the discrepancy, if any, is 

accordingly and promptly acted upon; and (ii) include all PPE in the 

physical count; 

 

e. The Disposal Committee to immediately undertake the appropriate  
disposal of unserviceable PPE;   

 

f. The accountable officer/end-user of the lost properties to prepare the 
RLSDDP and submit the same, duly supported with documents, to the 

Accounting and Property Sections, and Audit Team; and 

 

g. The responsible office to cause the titling/transfer of title of the donated 
land in the name of BBS to assert its ownership over said properties.   

 

5. Of the P25.2 million fund transferred for the implementation of the Philippine 
Identification System (PhilSys) project, a total of P14.8 million had already 

been disbursed for the procurement of event organizer of which the required 

weekly progress report was not submitted to the Source Agency as inputs to its 

project monitoring and reporting system as required under the Memorandum of 

Agreement (MOA). (Paragraph no. 5) 

 

We recommended that Management encourage the Focal Project Head of the 

PhilSys Campaign Project to regularly inform the PCOO the weekly progress 

of the project as required in the amended MOA.   

 
 

G. Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 

Of the 11 prior year’s audit recommendations contained in the CY 2019 

Annual Audit Report (AAR), 10 were implemented and 1 was not implemented.
