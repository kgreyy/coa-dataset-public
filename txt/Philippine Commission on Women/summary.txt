EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women (NCRFW) was 

renamed the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) on August 14, 2009 

through the passage of Republic Act (RA) No. 9710, the Magna Carta of Women 

(MCW). 

 

PCW is the primary policy-making and coordinating body of women and 

gender equality concerns under the Office of the President. It is mandated to review, 

evaluate and recommend measures, including priorities to ensure the full integration 

of women for economic, social and cultural development at the national, regional 

and international levels and to ensure further equality between men and women. Its 

mission is to make government work for women’s empowerment and gender 

equality and envision a future where women and men effectively contribute to and 

benefit from sustainable development. 

 

The Executive Director, assisted by two Deputy Executive Directors, oversees 

planning and implementation of PCW operations. The PCW is headed by a Board 

of Commissioners, which is chaired by Ms. Sandra S. Montano, who sets the 

policies, programs, thrusts and rules towards the achievement of the vision and 

mission of the Commission.  
 

As of December 31, 2020, PCW had a total of 84 authorized plantilla 

positions of which 74 were filled-up and 28 Contract of Services (COS) and Job 

Orders (JOs) personnel.

D. Scope of Audit 

 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of PCW for CY 2020. It was 

conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the 

Management’s assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the propriety of 

transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and 

regulations; c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and d) determine 

the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.  Moreover, the 

audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 

Institutions (ISSAIs). 

 

 

E. Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of 

the financial statements of PCW as at December 31, 2020. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The significant audit observations and recommendations were discussed with 

Management officials concerned, details of which are discussed in Part II of this 

report.  Management’s views and comments were incorporated in the report, where 

appropriate. 
 

1. The Accounts Payable was overstated by ₱1,625,952.54 due to the inclusion of 
liability to officers and employees of ₱461,090.14 and erroneous adjusting 

entry on fund releases to Non-Government Organizations (NGOs)/ People’s 

Organizations (POs) of ₱1,164,862.40, resulting in the understatement of the 

Due to Officers and Employees by ₱461,090.14 and Accumulated Surplus by 

₱1,164,862.40.  Moreover, the propriety and validity of Accounts Payable 

totaling ₱2,956,771.90 could not be ascertained due to absence of schedule to 

support the claims as required of Book VI, Section 41 of Executive Order (EO) 

No. 292. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to:  

 

a. Instruct the Accountant to make necessary adjusting entries to reflect the 
correct balances of the affected accounts, and 

b. Require the Accounting Unit to submit the complete supporting documents 
of the Accounts Payable recognized in the books. 



iv 
 

 

2. The erroneous entry of prior period travelling expenses amounting to 
₱72,947.42 for foreign and ₱88,181.08 for local and the overpayment of daily 

subsistence allowance (DSA) for foreign travel of ₱22,059.62, resulted in the 

overstatement of Travelling Expenses-Foreign and Travelling Expenses-Local 

by ₱95,007.04 and ₱88,181.08, respectively, understatement of the Due from 

Officers and Employees by ₱22,059.62 and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) by 

₱161,128.50. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. Require the concerned personnel to refund the overpaid travelling expenses, 
and 

 

b. Instruct the Accountant to make necessary adjusting entries to reflect the 
correct balances of the affected accounts. 

 

3. Out of the 259 and 298 reviewed GPBs for CY 2020 and 2019 that were 

submitted in CYs 2019 and 2018, respectively, only 50 or 19.31 percent and 

143 or 47.99 percent were formally endorsed to the Department of Budget and 

Management (DBM) due to the lack of policy or mechanism in place to 

monitor the resubmission, within 30 days, of the revised GPBs, as required 

under Sections 8.5 and 12.1.4 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular (JC) No. 

2012-01; thus, the inclusion of GAD in government budgets may not have been 

attained.  Moreover, PCW endorsed 10 GPBs for FY 2019 to the DBM even 

without their accompanying GAD ARs, contrary to Section 8.6 of the JC and 

Section 1.2.3.3.1 of Memorandum Circular (MC) 2017-003. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a. Policy Development, Planning, and Monitoring and Evaluation Division 

(PDPMED) to include a monitoring mechanism for the resubmission of the 

revised GBPs from concerned GPBs owners to strengthen its endorsement 

requirement process flow; and 

 

b. PCW Technical Officers/GBP reviewers to adhere strictly to applicable 

circular, rules, and regulations with regards to endorsement of GPBs. 

 

4. Unutilized fund amounting to ₱714,756.29 of the Great Women Project, which 
was already completed in CY 2012, was not yet returned to Canadian 

International Development Agency (CIDA) as required in the Contribution 

Arrangement between CIDA and PCW, nor was it reverted to the General Fund 

as provided for under EO No. 431. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to coordinate or make 

representation with CIDA on the disposition of the unutilized project fund 



v 
 

pursuant to Section 3.4 of the Contribution Arrangement; otherwise, this 

should be reverted/deposited to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr) in compliance 

with EO No. 431. 

 

5. The validity of the Due to Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations 
(GOCCs) account of ₱4,305,343.22 could not be established due to the absence 

of Memorandum of Agreement (MOAs)/Trust Agreements to verify the 

propriety of the expenses on the implementation of the programs/projects 

pertaining thereto. Moreover, ₱422,602.24 unutilized/unspent balance was not 

returned to the source agency, despite the completion of program for the 

transfer fund, contrary to COA Circular 94-013 and 2012-001. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. Ensure that all fund transfers be covered by either a MOA or a Trust 
Agreement, in the ensuing years; 

 

b. Coordinate with Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) on the 
forging of MOAs/Trust Agreement for all the fund received and for all 

succeeding grant for proper utilization, liquidation and reporting, for the 

achievement of its intended purpose;  

c. Return the unutilized amount of fund transfer from the Land Bank of the 
Philippines (LBP) for program already completed; and  

 

d. Utilized the unused balance of PCSO fund transfers for the implementation 
of programs which was approved by them. 

 

6. Propriety and regularity of the Consultancy Services totaling ₱1,280,763.55 
could not be established, due to a) incomplete documentary requirements 

contrary to COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, and b) non-posting of 

performance security of ₱108,888.85, inconsonance with Section 39 of the 

Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 9184. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. Require the Accounting Unit to submit the lacking documents for the 
payments of the Consultancy Services;  

 

b. Demand the posting of the five percent performance security of a winning 
Consultant through public bidding; and  

 

c. Comply with the prescribed rules and regulations pertaining to the 
submission of complete documents/reports and procurement procedures for 

each government transaction so as to establish validity of any claims from 

the Government and the faithful performance of contracts/agreement 
 



vi 
 

 

G. Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations 
 

Of the 12 audit recommendations embodied in the CY 2019 Annual Audit
