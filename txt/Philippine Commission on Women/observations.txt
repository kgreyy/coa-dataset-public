OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Financial Audit  
 

Reliability of Accounts Payable Account 
 

1. The Accounts Payable was overstated by ₱1,625,952.54 due to the inclusion of 
liability to officers and employees of ₱461,090.14 and erroneous adjusting 

entry on fund releases to NGOs/POs of ₱1,164,862.40, resulting in the 

understatement of the Due to Officers and Employees by ₱461,090.14 and 

Accumulated Surplus by ₱1,164,862.40.  Moreover, the propriety and validity 

of Accounts Payable totaling ₱2,956,771.90 could not be ascertained due to 

absence of schedule to support the claims as required of Book VI, Section 41 of 

EO No. 292. 

 

COA Circular No. 2013-002 dated January 30, 2013 prescribing the 

Adoption of the Revised Chart of Accounts for National Government Agencies 

which are described in Volume III Chapter III of Government Accounting Manual 

(GAM): 

 

Accounts Payable - this account is used to recognize receipt of goods or 

services on account in the normal course of trade and business operation. 

Debit this account for payment or settlement of liabilities. 

 

Due to Officers and Employees - this account is used to recognize 

incurrence of liability to officers and employees for salaries, benefits and 

other emoluments including authorized expenses advanced by the 

officers and employees. Debit this account for settlement or payment to 

officers and employees. 

 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) - this account is used to recognize the 

cumulative results of normal and continuous operations of an agency 

including prior period adjustments, effect of changes in accounting 

policy and other capital adjustments. This account is used to close the 

Revenue and Expense Summary account. 

 

Book VI, Section 41 of Executive Order No. 292 provides that obligation 

shall be certified to accounts payable unless the obligation is founded on a valid 

claim that is properly supported by sufficient evidence and unless there is proper 

authority for its incurrence. Any certification for a non-existent or fictitious 

obligation and/or creditor shall be considered void.  

 

Records showed that out of the total balance of the Accounts Payable as of 

December 31, 2020 of ₱5,476,131.91, ₱461,090.14 pertains to liability to officers 

and employees for their salaries, overtime pay, monetization of leave credits and 

honorarium as member of Bids and Awards Committee, to wit:

       Total 461,090.14  

 

The Accounting Division inadvertently recorded the ₱461,090.14 payable to 

officers and employees by crediting the Accounts Payable instead of Due to 

Officers and Employees account. 

 

Likewise, on December 19, 2019 records showed an entry was made to set-

up payable for fund releases to implementing partner (IP) to outright expense by 

debiting the Financial Assistance to NGOs/ POs account and crediting the 

Accounts Payable account amounting to ₱1,164,862.40. Subsequently, on January 

22, 2020 under journal entry voucher (JEV) No. 2020-001-2015, the said liability 

was paid and release to the IP by debiting the Accounts Payable and crediting CIB-

LCCA. However, on August 31, 2020 record showed an adjusting entry to 

reclassify the fund transfer to IPs which was previously recorded as an outright 

expense instead of debiting the Due from NGOs/POs. To wit: 

 

 Due from NGOs/POs   1,164,862.40 

  Accounts Payable   1,164,862.40 

 

To reclassify entry for JEV No. 2020-001-2015 dated January 22, 2020 for 

ECHOSI Foundation. 

 

The above entry was again erroneous, instead of crediting the Accounts 

Payable, the Accumulated Surplus should have been credited, since the error occurs 

upon the recording of the expenses Financial Assistance to NGOs/POs in 

December 2019.  

 

Based on the foregoing, the inclusion of liability to officers and employees of 

₱461,090.14 and erroneous recording of adjustment entry for fund releases 



34 

 

amounting to ₱1,164,862.40 overstated the Accounts Payable by ₱1,625,952.54 

and understating the Due to Officers and Employees by ₱461,090.14 and 

Accumulated Surplus by ₱1,164,862.40, thereby, affects the fair presentation of 

financial statements. 

 

Verification of the submitted JEVs to recognized PCW's liability or 

obligation for rendered services and delivered goods, revealed that out of the total 

amount of ₱5,476,131.91 recognized under the Accounts Payable account, 

₱2,956,771.90 or 49 submitted JEVs lacked documents to support recognition of 

the same in the books. Without the supporting documents, the Audit Team was 

precluded to determine the propriety and validity of the recorded payable account. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

a. Instruct the Accountant to make necessary adjusting entries to reflect the 
correct balances of the affected accounts, and 

b. Require the Accounting Unit to submit the complete supporting documents 
of the Accounts Payable recognized in the books. 

 

 

Overstatement of Travelling Expenses and related accounts 
 

2. The erroneous entry of prior period travelling expenses amounting to 
₱72,947.42 for foreign and ₱88,181.08 for local and the overpayment of DSA 

for foreign travel of ₱22,059.62, resulted in the overstatement of Travelling 

Expenses-Foreign and Travelling Expenses-Local by ₱95,007.04 and 

₱88,181.08, respectively, understatement of the Due from Officers and 

Employees by ₱22,059.62 and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) by ₱161,128.50. 

 

Section 4.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 states that 

excessive expenditures signifies unreasonable expenses or incurred at an 

immoderate quantity and exorbitant price. It also includes expenses which exceeds 

what is normal or proper, as well as expenses which are unreasonably high and 

beyond just measure or amount. They also include expenses in excess of reasonable 

limits. 

 

Conceptual framework for General Purpose Financial Reporting (GPFR) by 

public sector entities under the PPSAS provides that: 

 

“Under the accrual basis of accounting, transactions and other 

events are recognized in financial statements when they occur (and not 

only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the 

transactions and events are recorded in the accounting records and 

recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they 

relate.” 

 



35 

 

Financial statements prepared under the accrual basis of 

accounting inform users of those statements of past transactions 

involving the payment and receipt of cash during the reporting period, 

obligations to pay cash or sacrifice other resources of the entity in the 

future, the resources of the entity at the reporting date and changes in 

those obligations and resources during the reporting period. Therefore, 

they provide information about past transactions and other events that 

is more useful to users for accountability purposes and as input for 

decision making than is information provided by the cash basis or other 

bases of accounting or financial reporting.” 

 

Verification of entries disclosed that travelling expenses for CY 2019 were 

recognized in the current year totaling ₱161,128.50. Details of which are shown 

below.

TOTAL 161,128.50 

 

As shown from the above table, all the travels occurred in December 2019, 

hence, the expenses should have been recognized in CY 2019 and not on the year 

the same were liquidated, in compliance with the principle of accrual basis. Under 

such principle, transactions and events are recognized when they occur and not 

when paid.  The foregoing resulted in the overstatement of the Travelling Expenses 

Foreign of ₱72,947.42 and Local account by ₱88,181.08, understating the 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) by ₱161,128.50. 

Moreover, post–audit of the disbursement vouchers (DVs) on travelling 

expenses revealed that the DSA given to one personnel to cover expenses for his 

foreign travel was overstated by one day daily subsistence allowance equivalent to 

₱22,059.62.  

 



36 

 

Inquiry from the Accountant disclosed that the same was overlooked by her. 

The said overpayment is a clear example of expenses paid which exceeds what is 

normal or proper in accordance with COA Circular 2012-003, hence, should be 

disallowed and reimbursed by the concerned employee. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. Require the concerned personnel to refund the overpaid travelling 
expenses, and 

 

b. Instruct the Accountant to make necessary adjusting entries to reflect the 
correct balances of the affected accounts. 

 

 

B. Compliance Audit 
 

Reviewed 259 and 298 GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for CYs 2020 and 2019, 

respectively  
 

3. Out of the submitted 318 and 465 GPBs for CYs 2020 and 2019, respectively, 
259 or 81.45 percent and 298 or 64.09 percent were reviewed by PCW, in 

compliance with Section 12.1.3 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 and 

with the performance/outcome indicator, as specified in the GAA for FY 2019 

and 2018. 

Section 12.1.3 of the JC requires that PCW shall review the GPBs submitted 

by various line departments or agencies.  In line thereto, one of PCW’s outcome 

indicators in the GAA for CYs 2019 and 2018 is the review, within 30 days, of 30 

percent of the submitted GPBs and ARs.  

 

In CY 2015, PCW adopted the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System 

(GMMS), an online system designed to monitor the progress of agencies in gender 

mainstreaming.  Each agency and its bureaus, attached agencies and regional 

offices were given an account in the system to encode/submit its GPBs and GAD 

ARs.  

 

Once a government agency submitted its GBP and AR, the PCW reviewer 

under the Policy Development, Planning, and Monitoring and Evaluation Division 

(PDPMED) receives notifications, and within 30 days, he/she shall be able to 

review the same.  To be able to attain its target or the outcome indicator stated in 

the GAA, PCW ensures that 30 percent of these received GPBs and ARs are 

reviewed, and either endorsed to DBM or returned to the concerned agencies for 

revision or enhancement. 

 

In 2019, PCW had a total 31 in-house reviewers for CY 2020 GBPs and 2018 

GAD ARs, and a total 24 in-house and one external reviewers for 2019 GPBs and 

2017 GAD ARs. As a policy, the reviewers are given 30 days to review the GPB

revision/adjustment or for endorsement to DBM. 

  

Based on the data generated from the GMMS as of December 31, 2019 and 

2018, there were 939 and 936 registered agencies in the GMMS, respectively, 

which comprised of central and regional offices of line departments. Out of the total 

registered agencies in the GMMS, only 33.86 percent or 318 GBPs for CY 2020 

were submitted to PCW in CY 2019; and only 49.68 percent or 465 GBPs for CY 

2019 were submitted in CY 2018.  Likewise, in CY 2019, only 54.31 percent or 

510 GAD ARs for CY 2018 were submitted, and only 48.08 percent or 450 GAD 

ARs for CY 2017 were submitted in CY 2018, as illustrated in Figure 1. 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

It was reported in the GMMS, and validated by the Audit Team that in CY 

2019, PCW reviewers were able to review 81.45 percent or 259 out of the 318 

submitted GPBs and only 18.55 percent or 59 GPBs were not reviewed.  Out of the 

259 GPBs reviewed, 194 or 74.90 percent were reviewed within 30 days and 65 

were reviewed beyond 30 days.  It was likewise reported and validated that out of 

the 510 GAD ARs received by PCW, 81.57 percent or 416 were reviewed by PCW, 

of which 69.47 percent or 289 were reviewed within 30 days. 

 

While in CY 2018, GMMS reported and validated by the Audit Team that 

PCW was able to review 64.09 percent or 298 GPBs out of the 465 received for CY 

2019. Out of the 298 reviewed GPBs, 56.71 percent or 169 were reviewed within 

30 days while 43.29 or 129 were beyond 30 days.  For the GAD ARs received in 

CY 2018, 63.11 percent or 284 were reviewed out of the 450 received, of which 

68.66 percent or 195 were reviewed within 30 days, as illustrated in Figure 2.

Based on the above data, PCW was able to comply with Section 12.1.3 of the 

PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 and with the performance/outcome indicator as 

specified in the GAA for FY 2019 and 2018. 

 

We commended PCW for its compliance with the performance indicator 

incorporated in the GAAs for FY 2018 and 2019 with regards to the review of 

GPBs and GAD ARs. 

 

 

Only 50 or 19.31 percent and 143 or 47.99 percent GPBs were endorsed to DBM 
 

4. Out of the 259 and 298 reviewed GPBs for CY 2020 and 2019 that were 
submitted in CYs 2019 and 2018, respectively, only 50 or 19.31 percent and 

143 or 47.99 percent were formally endorsed to the DBM due to the lack of 

policy or mechanism in place to monitor the resubmission, within 30 days, of 

the revised GPBs, as required under Sections 8.5 and 12.1.4 of PCW-NEDA-

DBM JC No. 2012-01; thus, the inclusion of GAD in government budgets may 

not have been attained.  Moreover, PCW endorsed 10 GPBs for FY 2019 to the 

DBM even without their accompanying GAD ARs, contrary to Section 8.6 of 

the JC and Section 1.2.3.3.1 of MC 2017-003. 

Section 8.5 of the JC requires that if there are revisions to be made or 

questions to be answered about the submission, the agency concerned shall be 

given 30 days to resubmit the revised GPB, which thereafter, shall be endorsed to 

the DBM.   

  

Out of 259 reviewed GPBs for CY 2020 submitted in CY 2019, only 50 or 

19.31 percent were endorsed to the DBM as at December 31, 2019, while 143 or 

47.99 percent out of the 298 reviewed 2019 GPBs submitted in CY 2018 were 

endorsed as at December 31, 2018, as illustrated in Figure 3. 

 



39 

 

 

After the evaluation of the process flow on the submission, review and 

endorsement of the GBPs and ARs, it was noted that no mechanism exists to 

monitor the resubmission of the revised GBPs by concerned agencies within the 

prescribed period, as confirmed from the interview with PCW reviewers. They 

claimed that the low percentage rate of endorsement was a result of external factors, 

such as non-compliance of GPBs owners on the prescribed revision schedule of 30 

days, beyond PCW’s control, such as, the difficulty of the concerned agency in 

complying with the requested revisions, and retirement/resignation/reassignment of 

the previous GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) members or GMMS users/encoders, 

who prepared/submitted the original GPB and encoded the same in in the GMMS. 

 

Out of the sample 24 GPBs that were returned to concerned agencies, no 

follow-up or reminder for the resubmission of the returned GPBs was done by the 

assigned PCW reviewers since they claimed that this is not included in their process 

flow; thus, resulted in the very low percentage rate of endorsement to DBM. 

 

Moreover, our review of endorsed CY 2019 GPBs submitted in CY 2018 

disclosed that 10 agencies and regional offices were endorsed to DBM even without 

the accompanying GAD ARs, contrary to the requirement of the JC and MC 2017-

003 that PCW shall endorse the FY 2019 GPBs including corresponding GAD ARs 

of CY 2017. 

 

While there have been changes in CY 2019 for the endorsement requirements 

of GPBs for CY 2020, where MC No. 2019-02 dated August 1, 2019 no longer 

required the submission of CY 2018 GAD ARs, the requirements provided under 

PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 and MC 2017-003 for CY 2018 stands. 

 

Consequently, the inexistence of mechanism to monitor, within 30 days, the 

resubmission of the reviewed/returned GBPs by concerned agencies resulted in the 

low endorsement rate of GPBs to DBM.  

 

PCW, being the primary government body on women and gender equality 

concerns, serves as the over-all monitoring body and oversight to ensure the 



40 

 

implementation of relevant rules and regulations pertaining to it. Hence, effective 

and regular monitoring/follow-up procedures and post-review effort are necessary 

to reduce, if not eliminate, the risks of agencies not resubmitting their GPBs. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a. PDPMED to include a monitoring mechanism for the resubmission of the 
revised GBPs from concerned GPBs owners to strengthen its endorsement 

requirement process flow; and 

 

b. PCW Technical Officers/GBP reviewers to adhere strictly to applicable 
circular, rules, and regulations with regards to endorsement of GPBs. 

 

 

Unutilized balance of CIB-LCCA not yet returned nor reverted to the General Fund 
 

5. Unutilized fund amounting to ₱714,756.29 of the Great Women Project, which 
was already completed in CY 2012, was not yet returned to CIDA as required 

in the Contribution Arrangement between CIDA and PCW, nor was it 

reverted to the General Fund as provided for under EO No. 431. 

 

PCW is a recipient of a fund from the Global Affairs Canada (GAC) 

represented by Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) under 

Contribution Arrangement signed by both representative of PCW and GAC on 

November 15, 2006. This Arrangement supports the PCW project entitled GREAT 

Women, which aimed to establish a gender responsive enabling environment at the 

local level for the economic empowerment of women particularly in micro-

enterprises. The project was implemented in November 2006 and 

completed/terminal in December 2012.  

 

Section 3.4 of the said Contribution Arrangement states that except as 

otherwise determined by CIDA, PCW will return, through CIDA, to the Receiver 

General for Canada, any undisbursed or unaccounted for portion of the Contribution 

on the date of expiry or termination of the Arrangement. 

 

On the other hand, EO No. 431 dated May 30, 2005 was issued for the 

reversion of all dormant accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds to the general 

fund and for other purposes. Section 3.4 of the Permanent Committee Joint Circular 

No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012, the implementing rules and regulations of 

the said EO, defined unnecessary special and trust funds as authorized special and 

trust funds maintained by government agencies with AGDBs but which are no 

longer necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which said funds were 

established.  

 

The CIB-LCCA account of PCW has the following depository banks and 

amounts as of December 31, 2020:

We validated the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) of the above 

accounts and found that LBP Account No. 1512-1037-11 is for the WEE II Project 

that is still on-going; the LBP Account No, 1512-1032-23 is for the Great Women 

Project which was already completed in CY 2012, and the PNB Account No. 

168270004831 represents the trust fund received by PCW from other GOCCs for 

the implementation of specific activities such as Women’s Month Celebration, 18-

day Campaign to end Violence Against Women and Children (VAWC), 

Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Senior Officials Meeting on 

Gender Mainstreaming and other international commitments of the Philippine 

Government, Annual activities of IAC-VAWC and support to PCW as IAC-VAWC 

Secretariat. 

 

Further, analysis of the BRS for the GREAT Women Project disclosed that no 

transaction was made for the last four years from June 2016 except for the interest it 

earned, since the project was already completed/ terminated sometimes in CY 2016. 

 

Interview with the Chief Accountant revealed that the return of the 

undisbursed balance of ₱714,756.29 to CIDA was not yet done, since the 

Accounting Office are still waiting for the liquidation of the fund transfers to 

various LGUs totaling ₱805,545.14, which remained outstanding, despite the 

completion of the project in December 2012. Despite Management’s effort, in 

sending various confirmation and demand letters in March 2015, August 2020 and 

January 2021, no reply was made by the concerned LGUs.  

 

Moreover, review of the trial balance of the Great Project of CIDA as of 

December 31, 2020 disclosed that the only recorded payable in the book was the 

unremitted withholding tax under the Due to BIR amounting to ₱375.70.  

 

The failure to refund to CIDA or remit the unutilized balance of ₱714,756.29 

of the trust funds for the GREAT Project, which was already completed in CY 2016 

to the BTr, is not compliant with the above Contribution Arrangement and EO No. 

431.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to coordinate or make 

representation with CIDA on the disposition of the unutilized project fund 

pursuant to Section 3.4 of the Contribution Arrangement; otherwise, this 

should be reverted/deposited to the BTr in compliance with EO No. 431.

returned to the source agency, despite the completion of program for the 

transfer fund, contrary to COA Circular 94-013 and 2012-001. 

 

Item No. 3.1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 

specifically requires, among others, a copy of MOA/Trust Agreement as one of the 

documentary requirements of the IA on the implementation and liquidation of fund 

transfers.  
 

Moreover, Section 6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 prescribes the duties and 

responsibilities of the implementing agencies (IA’s) on the receipt, utilization, 

liquidation and return of funds received from source agency (SA), to wit: 
 

6.4 within five (5) days after the end of each month, the Accountable 

Officer (AO) shall prepare the RCI and the RD and shall submit 

them with all supporting vouchers/payrolls and documents to the 

Accountant.  These reports shall be approved by the Head of the 

Agency; 
 

6.5 within ten (10) days after receipt from the AO, the Accountant shall 

verify the Reports, provide accounting entries, record and submit the 

duplicate copies of the Reports with all the originals of 

vouchers/payrolls and all supporting documents to the IA Auditor.  

The Accountant shall ensure that only expenses for the project are 

included in the Reports.  He shall submit the original copy of the 

Reports to the SA (Attention: The SA Accountant); 
 

6.7 return to the SA any unused balance and refund of disallowance 

upon completion of the project. 
 

Likewise, Section 6, Chapter 19, Volume 1 of the GAM on the Fair 

Presentation of Financial Statements requires that an entity shall present, in the 

financial statement, information in a manner that meets the qualitative 

characteristics of financial reporting, one of which is reliability. Reliability states 

that reliable information is free from material error and bias, and can be depended 

on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to represent or could 

reasonably be expected to represent. 
 

The Due to GOCCs account has a total balance of ₱4,305,343.22 as of 

December 31, 2020 which comprises of funds received from LBP with a balance of 



43 

 

₱422,602.24 and the PCSO with net amount of ₱3,882,740.98. Details as shown in 

the table below:

Total  8,468,750.00 4,163,406.78 4,305,343.22 

 

Verification showed that the fund transfers from LBP and PCSO were not 

supported with the MOAs/Trust Agreements, instead these were supported only 

with correspondents with the Source Agencies (SA). Review of the correspondents 

disclosed that the same included only the amount of the fund transfers and its 

purpose. Hence, due to the absence of MOAs/Trust Agreements the audit team 

could not established the date of implementation, utilization, liquidation and return 

of funds received from the SAs. 

 

The Report of Collection and Deposit (RCD) for May 2017 disclosed that on 

May 31, 2017 PCW received ₱468,750.00 from the LBP purportedly for the 

sponsorship of PCW Women Summit on March 30-31, 2017. However, since the 

said fund was received only in May 2017, PCW requested instead to use the same 

for the PCW’s 18th campaigned to end VAW on November 2017, which was 

approved by the LBP.   The submitted SLs of the Due from GOCCs – LBP, showed 

a balance of ₱422,602.24 which had remained outstanding since December 31, 

2017 or for three years. Inquiry revealed that the Project was already completed in 

November 2017.  

 

On the other hand, the RCD of February 2020, showed that PCW received 

₱3,000,000.00 from PCSO with official receipt number 3999529 for the 

implementation of the 18th day Campaign to End VAW and for operations of IAC-

VAWC.  

   

Review of the subsidiary ledger (SL) of the Due to GOCC -PCSO disclosed 

that PCW received a total grant of ₱8,000,000.00 since CYs 2018 to 2020 from 

PCSO with a corresponding total disbursement of ₱4,117,259.02, as of December 

31, 2019.  Per inquiry from Management, it was learned that of the four 

programs/projects, three were already completed with an unutilized/unspent 

balance of ₱882,740.98. In February 2019, the PCSO approved the request of PCW 

to realign the unutilized amount, however, the same was also not utilized as of 

December 31, 2020. 

 



44 

 

Due to the absence of MOAs/Trust Agreement, the validity of the balance of 

the Due to GOCCs could not be ascertained and the audit team could not verify the 

propriety of the expenses on the implementation of the programs/projects. 

Moreover, the unutilized amount of ₱422,602.24 was not returned to LBP, despite 

the completion of the objective of the fund transfer, in accordance with Section 6.7 

of COA Circular No. 94-013. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. Ensure that all fund transfers be covered by either a MOA or a Trust 
Agreement, in the ensuing years; 

 

b. Coordinate with PCSO on the forging of MOAs/Trust Agreement for all 
the fund received and for all succeeding grant for proper utilization, 

liquidation and reporting, for the achievement of its intended purpose;  

 

c. Return the unutilized amount of fund transfer from the LBP for program 
already completed; and  

 

d. Utilized the unused balance of PCSO fund transfers for the implementation 
of programs which was approved by them. 

 

 

Consultancy Services inadequate supported with required documents  
 

7. Propriety and regularity of the Consultancy Services totaling ₱1,280,763.55 
could not be established, due to a) incomplete documentary requirements 

contrary to COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, and b) non-posting of 

performance security of ₱108,888.85, inconsonance with Section 39 of the 

Revised IRR of RA No. 9184. 

 

COA Circular 2012-001 prescribes the revised guidelines and documentary 

requirements for common government transactions. It provides that it is a 

fundamental principle under PD No. 1445 that claims against government funds 

shall be supported with complete documentation. It further states that sufficient and 

relevant to establish validity of claim is a general requirement in all types of 

disbursement. Item 9.1 thereof prescribes the specific requirement for each type of

The accounting office had obtained only the scanned copies of the 

ORs/Acknowledgement Receipt from the Consultants due to the pandemic.  

 

b) Non-posting of Performance Security amounting to ₱108,888.85 prior to 
signing of contract  

 

Section 39 of 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 states that the winning 

bidder shall post a performance security, equal to the required percentage of the 

total contract price prior to the signing of the contract, to guarantee the faithful 

performance by the winning bidder of its obligation. 

 

Verification disclosed that the Agency were unable to demand the posting of 

performance security from a consultant amounting to ₱108,888.85 which is equal 

to five percent of the contract price of ₱2,177,777.00. A public bidding was the 

mode of procurement for this contract. A performance security equal to 5 percent 

for consulting services should be posted by the winning bidder so as to guarantee 

faithful performance of obligation, in accordance with RA No. 9184. 

 

Due to the foregoing, the propriety and regularity of the Consultancy 

Services for the year could not be ascertained. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. Require the Accounting Unit to submit the lacking documents for the 
payments of the Consultancy Services;  

 

b. Demand the posting of the five percent performance security of a winning 
Consultant through public bidding; and  

 

c. Comply with the prescribed rules and regulations pertaining to the 
submission of complete documents/reports and procurement procedures 

for each government transaction so as to establish validity of any claims 



48 

 

from the Government and the faithful performance of 

contracts/agreement. 

 

  

Accommodation expenses on local travels exceeded the allowable rates 
 

8. Lapses in the processing of claims resulted in payment of actual 
accommodation on local travels exceeding the allowable rates by 37 to 204 

percent, with no certifications submitted to support the claim, and local or 

inland transportation was allowed inconsistent with Sections 5 (d) and 2 (b) of 

EO No. 77. 

  

Section 5 (d) of EO No. 77 on Travel Expenses in Excess of Authorized 

Travel Rates provides that claims for reimbursement of actual accommodation 

expenses in excess of the accommodation component of the daily travel expenses 

may be allowed, but in no case shall the difference exceed 100 percent of such 

component of the prescribed daily travel expense (DTE) rate, and only upon: (i) 

submission of certification by the agency head or authorized representative as 

absolutely necessary in the performance of an assignment; and (ii) presentation of 

bills and receipt 

 

On the other hand, Section 2 (b) of EO No. 77 defines daily travel expenses 

as an amount that covers cost of hotel accommodation, meals and incidental 

expenses which includes cost of local or inland transportation and reasonable 

miscellaneous expenses at the place of destination. 

 

Out of the 17 travels with claim for hotel accommodation, 14 exceeds the 

allowable daily travel allowance by 37 to 204 percent as shown in Annex D. The 

same were not supported by a certification from the Agency Head as to the absolute 

necessity and the corresponding guest folio so as to verify that such were availed by 

the PCW official and employees. Nevertheless, receipts and booking confirmations 

from AGODA are attached on their reimbursements. 

 

It was likewise noted that five out fourteen exceeds the 100 percent allowable 

excess of accommodation component of the DTE, inconsonance with Section 5 (d) 

of EO No. 77 which states that in no case shall the difference exceed 100 percent of 

the accommodation component of the prescribed DTE rate.  

 

Further verification revealed that local or inland transportations were allowed 

by the Agency in different local and foreign travels of employees totaling 

₱4,659.11, despite that per diems were already given. The local or inland 

transportation is one of the components of the incidental expenses of DTE or the 

DSA.  

 

Moreover, the following deficiencies were likewise noted: 

 



49 

 

a) Per diems given to employees includes a 1-day travel time before and after the 
event. Other travels include 2-3 days travel time. Although minimal in amount 

since usually the per diems given are only for incidental expenses it doesn’t 

withstand that travel times are not stated in the Travel Orders (TO), and 

 

b) All travels of the Foreign Assisted Project were on reimbursements basis, 
despite that travel orders were approved five to fifteen days ahead of the actual 

travels dates, thereby, having ample time to avail of cash advances for travel. 

Reimbursement includes payment for airfare or transportation to destinations, 

hotel accommodations and meals of the event’s participants, which is 

burdensome to employees, hence, should be avoided by the Agency.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to strengthen the review 

process of the Accounting Office consistent with the provisions of EO No. 77, 

particularly on the grant of allowable allowances  

 

 

Delayed submission of Contracts/MOAs/POs/JOs 
 

9. Delayed submission of copies of perfected Contracts/MOAs/POs/JOs and 
supporting documents from 6 to 361 days contrary to Section 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of 

COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, thus, precluding the 

Audit Team from performing its timely review and evaluation and 

communicating to the agency any deficiencies noted. 

 

Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, on the 

submission and review process of contracts, states that: 

 

Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the 

government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, 

including government-owned and controlled corporations and their 

subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents 

forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished 

to the Auditor of the agency concerned… 

 

While Section 3.2.1 of the same Circular, on the submission of purchase 

orders, states that: 

 

A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and 

every supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days from 

issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned… 

 

Our records showed that copies of perfected contracts and approved POs/JOs 

were submitted beyond the required timeframe of five days after its execution. It 

was the practice of the agency to submit these documents 6 to 361 days after 

delivery of the goods or execution of the contract.  



50 

 

 

It was likewise noted that sales invoices, delivery receipts or inspection and 

acceptance reports are the only documents attached to its POs/JOs and at times 

TORs for Contracts.  

 

As a result, the Audit Team were precluded from performing the timely 

review and evaluation of the contracts/POs/JOs and to communicate deficiencies 

noted, if any, as early as possible for the management to effect corrective measures. 

 

 We recommended and Management agreed to enjoin responsible 

officials/personnel to strictly comply with the submission of perfected 

contracts and approved POs/JOs to the Auditor within the prescribed period 

required under the aforementioned COA Circular, lest unjustified compliance 

shall be subject to the administrative disciplinary action provided for in 

Section 127 of Presidential Decree No. 1445, among others.
