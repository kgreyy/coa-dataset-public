For CY 2020, NAMRIA received allotment from regular budget of P1,370.203 million, automatic appropriation of P8.410 million and special purpose fund of P41.214 million or a total allotment of P1,419.827 million.



In addition, NAMRIA reported a total income of P3.429 million for the sales of various maps and other miscellaneous fees, as authorized under DENR Administrative Order No. 31 dated April 27, 1988, implementing EO No. 192, which was deposited to the National Treasury.



C)	Scope and Objectives of Audit



The audit was conducted on the accounts and financial transactions of the NAMRIA for CY 2020 to (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of the implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.

	

D)	Independent Auditor’s Report



We do not express an opinion on the financial statements due to various accounting deficiencies such as absence of subsidiary ledgers and lack of complete accounting records on 36 accounts (excluding prior period errors) with an aggregate amount of P678.494 million, which prevented alternative audit procedures to be undertaken to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence relating to various assertions on the accounts, as discussed in detail in Part II of the report.



E)	Significant Observations and Recommendations on Compliance to Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements



1)	Overall, the NAMRIA’s fund utilization/obligation of P1,402.737 million is 98.80 percent compared to its appropriation/allotment of P1,419.827 million, of which P1,218.450 million or 85.82 percent pertains to its major program, the Mapping and Resources Information Program (MRIP), which registered a 98.69 percent utilization rate and utilized in accordance with the purpose of appropriation/allotment. The unutilized fund of P17.090 million pertains to unbilled contracts. (Observation No. 2)



We recommended and Management agreed to ensure that projects are completed within its project duration and accomplishments during the year are billed at year-end to make use of the released allotment.



2)	Of the total cash allocation received during the year of P1,357.980 million, P1,241.754 million or 91.44 percent was utilized/disbursed, leaving a balance of P116.226 million or 8.56 percent, which automatically lapsed and reverted back to the Bureau of Treasury. Moreover, the total disbursements of the Mapping and Resources Information Program, which amounted to P1,019.611 million represents 84.79 percent of the obligated amount, of which transactions amounting to P40.888 million were found to be irregular. Likewise, the non-utilization of NCA amounting to P116.226 million was due to undelivered equipment and unbilled contracts wherein billings were received beyond the cut-off date therefore, no payments were made at year-end. (Observation No. 3)



We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	require the Director, Mapping and Geodesy Branch and the Bids and Awards Committee to ensure that all procurement activities and implementation of programs must be within the time frame to avoid the lapsing of Notice of Cash Allocations; and



b)	instruct the BAC Secretariat and all end-users to immediately submit the disbursement vouchers with complete supporting documents to the Accounting Section to facilitate its payment and to avoid the reversion of the fund.



3)	Cash advances for operating expenses, official local and foreign travels and special purpose/time-bound undertakings amounting to P37.112 million or 69.80 percent of the total cash advances granted during the year, which amounted to P53.168 million, were not liquidated in accordance with COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountant to:



	a)	issue demand letter/Order of Payment to each Accountable Officer whose cash advances are already due for liquidation and to deduct from any claims of the employees concerned until the cash advances will be fully liquidated in accordance with Section 5.8 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997; and



	b)	sustain its efforts to refrain from granting cash advances to AOs who failed to liquidate the previous cash advances granted in conformity with Section 4.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002.



4)	Fund transfers to NGAs for the implementation of projects in prior years amounting to P0.794 million were still not liquidated, despite completion in 2012, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013. (Observation No. 6)

	

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to:



	a)	submit the requirements for write-off pursuant to the provisions contained in COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016;



	b)	intensify collaboration with the IA Accountants to ensure prompt submission of liquidation reports upon completion of projects and require immediate refund of unutilized balances, if any; and



	c)	strictly adhere to the provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013 to avoid accumulation of long outstanding/unliquidated balances.

	

5)	Fund transfers to the Procurement Service (PS) for its supplies and equipment requirement amounting to P0.316 million remained unliquidated at year-end, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013. Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years amounting to P1.546 million or 2.12 percent of prior year’s balance of P72.770 million. (Observation No.7)

	

	We recommended and Management agreed to require the:

	

	a)		Chief, Property and Supply Division to reconcile the items received with that of the records of the PS-DBM and continuously coordinate with them for the immediate delivery of the remaining items; and

	

	b)		Chief Accountant to require the PS to refund the unutilized amount of fund transfer pertaining to the prior years’ balances, if the items previously requested are no longer needed.



6)	Copies of 166 government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents with corresponding amount of P726.609 million were issued during the year, of which 115 amounting to P146.973 million were not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from 2 to 119 days as of year-end, which is inconsistent with items 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009. (Observation No. 12)



We recommended and Management agreed to:



	a)	direct the Chairman of the Bids and Awards Committee and the BAC Secretariat to take responsibility in submitting copies of contracts and POs, together with their supporting documents to the Office of the Auditor within five (5) days from execution of the contract, in accordance with COA Circular No. 2009-001;

	b)	order the concerned officials/employees to comply with the above-cited regulations, otherwise, the provision under Section 122 of PD 1445 shall be enforced; and



	c)	instruct the Property Officer/BAC Secretariat to stop the practice of waiting for the deliveries of the procured items before submission of the perfected contracts and its attachments to the COA, as it is not the proper procedure set forth by the abovementioned Circular.



7)	The 15 contracts on professional services, which amounted to P359.742 million, entered into by and between the NAMRIA and four (4) contractors, were not properly deducted with applicable taxes in accordance with Section 2 of RR No. 11-2018 dated January 31, 2018 and Section 4-114-2 of Revenue Regulations No. 13-2018, resulting in the over-payments of contracts and under-withholding of taxes by P 40.888 million. (Observation No. 17)



We recommended that Management:



	a)	 comply with the provisions of the RIRR of RA 9184 as regards the classification of projects to be bidded and ensure that the categorization of contracts are consistent with the Approved Annual Procurement Plan; and



	b)	collect from the contractors the overpayments made in the amount of P40.888 million and remit the same to the BIR in accordance with existing revenue regulations.



The observations and recommendations, which are discussed in Part II of this report, were communicated to Management through Audit Observation Memoranda and discussed with concerned agency officials in a virtual exit conference held on April 8, 2021. Management views and comments were considered in this report, where appropriate.





F)	 Enforcement of Settlement of Accounts





There were no unsettled audit suspensions, disallowances and charges in the prior years. However, audit suspensions and disallowances issued for the CY 2020 transactions, which were post-audited after the reporting date, amounted to P14.466 million and P 40.888 million, respectively.



The Notices of Suspensions (NSs) issued pertain to the payments of incentive allowance sourced from trust fund projects’ savings without legal valid supporting documents while the Notices of Disallowance (NDs) issued pertain to the over-payments and under-withholding of taxes of 15 contracts on the Outsourcing for the production of new series large-scale Orthoimages and Topographics Maps due to improper application of tax rates on the creditable withholding tax (CWT) and the final VAT on government money payments (GMP), as discussed in Part II of this report. The NDs are subject for appeal within six (6) months from date of issue.





G)	Implementation of Prior Year’s Recommendations



Out of the 30 audit recommendations contained in 2019 Annual Audit Report, 14 were fully implemented and 16 were not implemented and reiterated with modifications, where appropriate.
