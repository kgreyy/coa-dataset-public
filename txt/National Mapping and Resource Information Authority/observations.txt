PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)	Financial Audit



Uncorrected accounting deficiencies

		

1)	We do not express an opinion on the Financial Statements due to various accounting deficiencies such as non-maintenance of Subsidiary Ledgers and lack of complete accounting records on various accounts with an aggregate amount of P678.494 million, which prevented alternative audit procedures to be undertaken to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence relating to various assertions on the accounts.



Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 provides that: “Financial Statements shall present fairly the financial position; financial performance and cash flow of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs.”



Accounting errors and omissions amounting to P155.769 million were adjusted/corrected by the Chief Accountant as of the reporting date, as shown below:

However, accounting deficiencies such as non-maintenance of Subsidiary Ledgers and lack of complete accounting records on 36 accounts, excluding undetermined accounts affected by prior period adjustments, with an aggregate amount of P678.494 million, which prevented alternative audit procedures to be undertaken to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence relating to various assertions on the accounts could possibly materially misstate the reported Assets, Liabilities and Net Assets/Equity amounting to P2,631.692 million, P93.451 million, and P2,538.241 million, respectively:

In view of the accounting deficiencies, such as absence of subsidiary ledgers and lack of accounting records, affecting various accounts with an aggregate amount of P678.494 million, which prevented alternative audit procedures to be undertaken to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence relating to various assertions on the accounts, where the possible effect on the assets, liabilities and accumulated surplus/deficit accounts could be material and pervasive, we do not express an opinion on the Financial Statements.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant to:



a)	maintain complete and updated subsidiary ledgers, specifically:



i)		Supplies Ledger Cards on each type of Inventories;



ii)		PPE Ledger Cards on each category of Property Plant and Equipment;



iii)		Subsidiary Ledgers for Receivables, Payables, Income and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit accounts;



iv)	Index of Payments for all expense accounts.



b)	reconcile the variances between the SLC and RPCI for inventories; PPELC and RPCPPE for PPE accounts; SLs for Receivables, Accounts Payable/Inter-Agency/Intra-Agency/Other Payable accounts with the ageing schedules; and the SCBAA with SFP and the Notes to FS; and,



c)	trace up the details of the long outstanding balances of accounts and take up in the books the prior period errors to correct the balances of the affected accounts. 





B)	Compliance with Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

	

Fund utilization



2)	Overall, the NAMRIA’s fund utilization/obligation of P1,402.737 million is 98.80 percent compared to its appropriation/allotment of P1,419.827 million, of which P1,218.450 million or 85.82 percent pertains to its major program, the Mapping and Resources Information Program (MRIP), which registered a 98.69 percent utilization rate and utilized in accordance with the purpose of appropriation/allotment. The unutilized fund of P17.090 million pertains to unbilled contracts.



Section 60 of the general provisions of RA No. 11465, otherwise known as the Fiscal Year 2020 General Appropriations Act (GAA) provides that:



“All appropriations authorized in this Act, xxx, shall be available for release and disbursements for the purpose specified, and under the same general and special provisions applicable thereto, until December 31, 2020.



After the end of validity period, all unreleased appropriations shall lapse, while unexpended or undisbursed funds shall revert to the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund in accordance with Section 28, Chapter 4, Book VI of E.O. No. 292 and shall not thereafter be available for expenditures except by subsequent legislative enactment.



For FY 2020, the appropriation for infrastructure capital outlays, xxx, shall be valid for obligation until December 31, 2020, while completion of construction, inspection, and payment shall be made not later than December 31, 2021. On the other hand, appropriations for MOOE and other capital outlays items shall likewise be valid for obligation until December 31, 2020 while delivery, inspection and payment shall be made not later than June 30, 2021.”



The agency’s overall fund utilization/obligation during the Calendar Year (CY) 2020, as shown in the Table 1 below, was P1,402.737 million out of the P1,419.827 million or 98.80 percent of the total allotment of NAMRIA in CY 2020, leaving an unexpended balance of P17.090 million or 1.20 percent.

The Budget Officer explained that the unobligated balance of P15.912 million, which represents 1.31 percent of the total allotment for the budget year, pertains to billings received beyond the cut-off date.



We recommended and Management agreed to ensure that projects are completed within its project duration and accomplishments during the year are billed at year-end to make use of the released allotment.



Low cash utilization/disbursements



3)	Of the total cash allocation received during the year of P1,357.980 million, P1,241.754 million or 91.44 percent was utilized/disbursed, leaving a balance of ₱116.226 million or 8.56 percent, which automatically lapsed and reverted back to the Bureau of Treasury. Moreover, the total disbursements of the Mapping and Resources Information Program, which amounted to P1,019.611 million represents 84.79 percent of the obligated amount, of which transactions amounting to P40.888 million were found to be irregular. Likewise, the non-utilization of NCA totaling P116.226 million was due to undelivered equipment and unbilled contracts wherein billings were received beyond the cut-off date therefore, no payments were made at year-end.



Section 3.4 of the National Budget Circular No. 578 dated January 6, 2020 states that: “With the adoption of the Cash Budgeting System (CBS) and consistent with Section 60, GPs of the FY 2020 GAA, all appropriations authorized under the FY 2020 GAA, xx, shall be available for release and disbursement for the purpose specified, and under the same General and Special Provisions of said GAA applicable thereto until December 31, 2020.”



The Agency’s overall cash utilization/disbursements as of December 31, 2020, as shown in Table 3 below, was only P1,241.754 million or 91.44 percent of the P1,357.980 million total NCA received during the year, leaving an unutilized balance of P116.226 million or 8.56 percent.

On the other hand, the cash utilization/disbursements of the Mapping and Resources Information Program as of December 31, 2020, as shown in Table 4 below, was only P1,019.611 million or 88.15 percent of its total NCA received of P1,156.695 million, leaving an unutilized NCA of P137.084 million or 11.85 percent, which can still be considered as a low cash utilization rate.

The Budget Officer explained that the reasons for the low utilization of the NCA for Capital Outlay of P84.719 million was due to the undelivered equipment of the NAMRIA survey vessel for the Mapping and Resources Information Program, which originates from other country and delivery was delayed due to the pandemic. Other reasons for low utilization are: billings of contracts were received beyond the cut-off date or contractors have not submitted any statement of accounts/billings and work orders for the Mapping projects, which were rescheduled so as not to affect the operations of the printing of maps. Hence, no payments were made at year-end.



On the other hand, the Budget Officer also informed the Audit Team that the utilization of the RLIP was only 47.79 percent due to the issuance of DBM Circular Letter No. 2020-6 dated March 30, 2020, revising the payment arrangements of employer (government) share in Retirement and Life Insurance Premium (RLIP) contributions remitted to the GSIS.



Section 4.2 of the Circular Letter states that: “starting April 2020, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) shall directly remit to the GSIS the government share in the RLIP contribution for all departments, bureaus and offices of the national government.”



Moreover, the low utilization of the MPBF was due to the discontinuance of the promotion and hiring process of new employees for the various branches of the NAMRIA due to the suspension on the deliberation of the promotion and recruitment due to the Covid-19 pandemic situation.



Hence, the funds specifically intended for the RLIP and other programs, wherein the implementation was delayed and/or not implemented in 2020 due to pandemic, were not utilized.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	require the Director, Mapping and Geodesy Branch and the Bids and Awards Committee to ensure that all procurement activities and implementation of programs must be within the time frame to avoid the lapsing of Notice of Cash Allocations; and



b)	instruct the BAC Secretariat and all end-users to immediately submit the Disbursement Vouchers with complete supporting documents to the Accounting Section to facilitate its payment and to avoid the reversion of the fund.



Reversion of dormant cash, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary fund



4)	The agency has no dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds and other related accounts for reversion as of year-end, in conformity with Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012, implementing EO No. 431, dated May 30, 2005. All fees, charges, assessments and other receipts or revenues collected, trust receipts and performance bonds and deposits, among others, except as authorized by law to be retained by the agency for its use, were deposited/remitted to the National Treasury pursuant to Sections 4 to 14 of the FY 2020 GAA (Receipts and Income).



Non-liquidation of cash advances

	

5)	Cash advances for operating expenses, official local and foreign travels and special purpose/time-bound undertakings amounting to P37.112 million or 69.80 percent of the total cash advances granted during the year, which amounted to P53.168 million were not liquidated in accordance with COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997.



The pertinent rules and regulations in the granting and liquidation of cash advances among others are enumerated in the succeeding paragraphs.



--	No additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made. A cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served. Transfer of cash advance from one Accountable Officer (AO) to another shall not be allowed. (Section 4.1, COA Circular No. 97-002)



--	All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of the year. Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipt. (Section 5.8, supra)



--	For local travel, liquidation shall be done within a period of 30 days upon return to the personnel’s workstation. On the other hand, cash advance for foreign travel shall be liquidated within 60 days upon return to the Philippines. (Section 5.1.3, supra)



--	At the start of the ensuing year, a new cash advance may be granted, provided that a list of expenses against the previous cash advance is submitted. However, when no liquidation of the previous cash advance is received on or before January 20, the Accountant shall cause the withholding of the AO’s salary. (Section 5.9, supra)



--	Cash advances for special time-bound undertaking shall be liquidated by the accountable officer within one month from the date the purpose of the cash advance was accomplished. (Section 4.1.3 (ix), COA Circular No. 2009-002)



	Of the total cash advances to officers and employees, operating expenses and special disbursing officers granted during the year, which amounted to P53.168 million, P37.112 million or 69.80% were not yet liquidated as of December 31, 2020. The details are presented below.

Inquiry disclosed that cash advances granted to officers and employees in CY 2020 for official travels were expended for the purchase of airline tickets, however, the scheduled travels did not push through because of the pandemic.



The cash advances for operating expenses and Special Disbursing Officers pertain to cash advances granted for special undertakings totaling P34.295 million, of which the amount of P14.970 million pertains to cash advances granted in December 2020, which is therefore not yet due for liquidation.



Thus, the non-compliance by the agency on the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 resulted in the accumulation of unliquidated cash advances, which amounted to P37.112 million at year-end.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountant to:



a)	 issue demand letter/Order of Payment to each Accountable Officer whose cash advances are already due for liquidation and to deduct from any claims of the employees concerned until the cash advances will be fully liquidated in accordance with Section 5.8 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997; and



b)	sustain its efforts to refrain from granting cash advances to AOs who failed to liquidate the previous cash advances granted in conformity with Section 4.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002.

	

The management informed the audit team that demand letters were issued to concerned employees and Accountable Officers for the immediate settlement of cash advances; continuous monitoring of request for cash advances by maintaining subsidiary ledgers of each account; and processing of request for cash advances of officials and employees with outstanding accounts were held in abeyance until obligations are fully settled.

	

Non- liquidation of fund transfers to implementing agencies– P0.794 million

	

6)	Fund transfers to NGAs for the implementation of projects in prior years amounting to P0.794 million were still not liquidated, despite completion in 2012, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013.



Section 5.4 of COA Circular No. 94-013 provides that: “The Source Agency (SA) shall require the Implementing Agency (IA) to submit the reports and furnish the IA with a copy of the journal voucher (JV) taking up the expenditures. Xxx…xxx.”

These outstanding fund transfers pertain to the Philippine Reference System (PRS)-92 projects, wherein the funds were transferred to IA in 2011 and the project were expected to be completed in CY 2012. But said fund transfers remained unliquidated despite its completion in 2012 and therefore, the funds had been outstanding for nine years.



A letter dated January 12, 2021 was submitted to the audit team requesting for write-off of the unliquidated fund transfer to the Land Management Bureau in the amount of P0.512 million. However, the documents attached to the request do not comply with the requirements prescribed in COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, hence the subject request was returned to the Management for compliance.



The Chief Accountant, Financial and Management Division (FMD) informed the Audit Team that demand letters were sent to four IAs in December 2020 but no replies were received yet. Also, coordination was made by the Chief Accountant with the IAs Accountants that still failed to liquidate their unliquidated fund transfers.



The results of coordination efforts are shown below:



Office/Region

Status

DENR-NCR

The Accountant is already processing the refund for the whole amount of P741.680 million.

DENR Region VI

The Regional Accountant is still validating the amount with commitment to settle the unliquidated fund transfer within the first quarter of CY 2021.

DENR-ARMM

The FMD exerted diligent efforts to communicate with the Responsible Officer thru mails and telephone calls, but to no avail.

LMB

The Chief Accountant hand-carried the list of documentary requirments to the LMB for the request for write-off.



On the other hand, the Audit Team Leader sent confirmation letters to the IAs on January 7, 2021. Two (2) replies were received by the team from the Audit Team Leaders of the DENR-NCR and the LMB confirming the unliquidated balances.



However, in our assessment, the agency’s monitoring mechanism on the fund transfers in the past was inadequate, hence fund transfers were not liquidated within the period provided for in the Memorandum of Agreement entered into by the NAMRIA and the Implementing Agencies. In cases like this, the Agency Chief Accountant along with Chief of the FMD should have analyzed the accounts balances and require the IAs to liquidate the cash advances by sending demand letters as soon as the agreed upon project duration has elapsed.



In like manner, the Agency’s Operation Department responsible for monitoring the implementation of the project, should have furnished the FMD of all documents pertaining to the project’s implementation and completion, which shall serve as the basis of the FMD in sending demand letters to the IAs. We also noted the lack of coordination between the Operation and FMD.



It must be emphasized that strict compliance with rules and regulations on the granting and liquidation of fund transfer is imperative to avoid accumulation of unliquidated balances.



Thus, the Agency is not compliant with Section 5.4 of COA Circular No. 94-013 as regards the liquidation of fund transfers to IAs.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to:



a)	submit the requirements for write-off pursuant to the provisions contained in COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016;



b)	intensify collaboration with the IA Accountants to ensure prompt submission of liquidation reports upon completion of projects and require immediate refund of unutilized balances, if any; and



c)	strictly adhere to the provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013 to avoid accumulation of long outstanding/unliquidated balances.



Non-liquidation of fund transfers to PS - P1.546 million



7)	Fund transfers to Procurement Service (PS) for its supplies and equipment requirement amounting to P0.316 million remained unliquidated at year-end, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013. Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years amounting to P1.546 million or 2.12 percent of prior year’s balance of P72.770 million.



Section 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 provides that it is the duty and responsibility of the Implementing Agency (IA) to return to the Source Agency (SA) any unused balance and refund of disallowance upon the completion of the project.



In CY 2020, the NAMRIA transferred funds to the Procurement Service of the Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) for the procurement of common-use supplies and equipment in the amount of P315,763.00, however, no deliveries were made by the PS-DBM as of year-end, leaving the full amount unliquidated. Likewise, 2.12 percent or P1,545,903.04 of the prior year’s balance remained unliquidated as of year-end, as shown below:

Inquiry with the Head, Property and Supply Division disclosed that the items requested by the end-users were not delivered on time and deliveries were incomplete. The staff of the PS when inquired on the partial deliveries, explained that the prices of certain supplies increased, thus the quantity delivered were adjusted.



Thus, the non-delivery of the items procured in a timely manner deprived the agency of its immediate use and defeats the very purpose and usefulness of the items procured. Moreover, the items requested in prior years, which dates back in 2015, may have been phased out or obsolete, and already lost its necessity and purpose. Thus, a request for refund to the Bureau of the Treasury of the unliquidated funds should be made immediately.



This is a reiteration of prior year’s audit findings.

	

We recommended and Management agreed to require the:



	a)	Chief, Property and Supply Division to reconcile the items received with that of the records of the PS-DBM and continuously coordinate with them for the immediate delivery of the remaining items; and



	b)	Chief Accountant to require the PS to refund the unutilized amount of fund transfer pertaining to the prior years’ balances, if the items previously requested are no longer needed.



A letter dated November 9, 2020 was sent by the agency to the Executive Director, PS-DBM requesting for a written reply if the non-delivery of the total requested quantities were really due to off-setting of previously withdrawn goods due to uncontrolled increase of prices of certain items, but no reply was received by the agency to date.







Dormant accounts for write-off



8)	The agency has no dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers for write-off, in accordance with Section 8.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



Insurance of physical assets with the GSIS



9)	The agency insured with the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) property amounting to P1,865.16 million with corresponding insurance premiums paid in the amount of P31.356 million, in accordance with Republic Act (RA) No. 656, other known as the “Property Insurance Law” as amended by Presidential Decree (PD) No. 245 dated July 13, 1973.



Disposal of unserviceable property



10)	The unserviceable properties of the NAMRIA with an appraised value of P0.185 million was disposed of through sale amounting to P0.186 million, after the public bidding process was held by the agency’s Disposal Committee, in compliance with Section 79 of PD 1445.



	Emergency Procurement during State of Public Health Emergency (Covid-19 Pandemic)



11)	The agency’s mode of procurement of goods and services during the State of Public Health Emergency arising from the Covid-19 amounting to P2.204 million were in accordance with COA and Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Joint Memorandum Circular No. 1 dated March 26, 2020, Emergency Procurement by the Government During a State of Public Health Emergency Arising from the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (Covid 19).

12)	Copies of 166 government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents with corresponding amount of P726.609 million were issued during the year, of which 115 amounting to P146.973 million were not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from 2 to 119 days as of year-end, which is inconsistent with items 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009.



Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 requires that: “a copy of contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned within five working days from the execution of the contract by the agency.”



Section 3.2.1 of the same Circular provides that: “a copy of any purchase order (PO), irrespective of amount, and all supporting documents thereto, shall be submitted to the unit or agency Auditor concerned within five working days from issuance thereof.”



	A total of 166 contracts and POs with corresponding amount of P726.609 million were issued during the year, and 115 contracts and POs amounting to P146.973 million or 69.28% of the contracts and POs entered into/issued were not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from two to 119 days inconsistent with the above stated provisions of COA Circular No. 2009-001, as shown in the table below.

Inquiry with management disclosed that the delay was caused by the practice of the Property and Supply Management Section to wait for the delivery of the procured items and consolidate all the documentary requirements relative therein before submitting to the Office of the Auditor.



	Likewise, the non-submission of the copies of the contracts within the prescribed period of time precluded the timely auditorial review aimed at evaluating compliance with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations and the immediate measures for whatever deficiencies noted during the initial evaluation.



	Thus, the Agency is not compliant, in all material respects, with provisions under Sections 3.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-01 as regards the submission of the perfected contracts within five (5) days from its execution/issue.



	This is a reiteration of the previous years’ audit findings that until now remained unresolved.



	We recommended and Management agreed to:

	

a)	direct the Chairman of the Bids and Awards Committee and the BAC Secretariat to take responsibility in submitting copies of contracts and POs, together with their supporting documents to the Office of the Auditor within five (5) days from execution of the contract, in accordance with COA Circular No. 2009-001;

	

b)		order the concerned officials/employees to comply with the above-cited regulations, otherwise, the provision under Section 122 of PD 1445 shall be enforced; and



c)		instruct the Property Officer/BAC Secretariat to stop the practice of waiting for the deliveries of the procured items before submission of the perfected contracts and its attachments to the COA, as it is not the proper procedure set forth by the abovementioned Circular.

	

	Management commented that the delays in the submission of the contracts and POs were due to confusion on the part of the concerned employee thinking that submission will be made only after complete and final delivery of goods or services.

	

	However, the Audit Team avers that government contracts and POs are to be submitted to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed timelines in COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, which is five (5) days after the execution and conformity by the contractor/supplier.

	

Withholding and remittance of GSIS contributions, loans and employer’s share



13)	The GSIS personal share and loan amortizations of employees amounting to P40.886 million (net of refunds) were deducted properly, however, remitted with delays and not in full amounts, which is not in accordance with RA No. 8291, the GSIS Act of 1997. Likewise, the monthly employer’s share amounting to P14.160 million were also remitted with delays. Moreover, the agency has still unremitted balances in the prior and current years’ amounting to P1.965 million and P2.734 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020, wherein the PY’s balance is subject for reconciliation.



Section 14.1, Rule III of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 8291 provides that:



“Each government agency shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and government agency’s contributions within the first ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply. The remittance by the government agency of the contributions to the GSIS shall take priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations except salaries and wages of its employees.”







Section 15 of the same IRR further provides that:



“the government agency shall be imposed interest for every month of delay, or a portion thereof, in the remittance of the monthly premium contributions and other amounts due the GSIS, at the rate of 2% per month simple interest. Such interest will begin to accrue at the end of the month following the due month.”



As of December 31, 2020, the agency withheld the amount of P40.886 million monthly premium contributions and loan payments (net of refund of loans and adjustment) and remitted the amount of P52.312 million, inclusive of government share of P14.160 million.



	Likewise, the agency remitted the contributions incurring delays, considering that contributions were remitted beyond the tenth calendar day of the month of the following applicable months, such as the case of April, May and July 2020, with delays ranging from 9 days to 61 days and not in full amounts.



	The table below shows the discrepancies between the contributions withheld and the amounts remitted of the employees contributions and loans and the corresponding days of delay of remittances:

Management explained that the delays in the remittances to the GSIS were attributed to the Work From Home (WFH) and Skeletal Work Force (SWF) scheduling, since the completion of the processing of required documents are dependent on the resumption from work of the concerned employees.



However, in our assessment, the non-remittance in full of the amounts withheld for GSIS Insurance premiums and loan amortization was due to the lack of monitoring/analysis of the account balances due to absence of subsidiary ledgers. It has nothing to do with the work arrangements, but rather a matter of taking responsibility to the assigned task by the responsible staff since the problem existed even before the pandemic.

	

Thus, the Agency is not compliant, in all material respects, with the provisions contained in Section 14.1, Rule III Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA No. 8291, the GSIS Act of 1997.



Also, the delayed remittances will put the management at risk in paying the penalties as provided by the abovementioned Section 15 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA No. 8291.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountant to:



a)	ensure full and timely remittances of the GSIS Insurance premiums and loan amortizations every month. Otherwise, any penalty for late remittance shall be imposed with the erring official and employees;



b)	determine the composition of the prior years’ unremitted balance in the amount of P1.965 million and remit immediately to the GSIS; and



c)	maintain subsidiary ledgers by nature of GSIS deductions and for each employee’s GSIS premiums, loan amortizations and government shares.



Management commented that the Accounting and Human Resource and Management Sections have conducted a meeting with the GSIS, NCR 3 for guideline in the reconciliation of unremitted accounts; submitted to the GSIS the updated service records of employees; and remitted the amount of P191,677.15 pertaining to CY 2019 unremitted amounts in the 1st quarter of 2021.



However, reconciliation of the account for CY 2010-2018 and updating of subsidiary ledgers for each employee is still on-going. The employee’s share and loan amortizations of some employees due to promotion, new hiring and salary increase, among others, were remitted on time and in full amounts, as well as the adjustment of share and loan amortizations. On the other hand, the timely monthly remittance for salary increase was delayed due to the manual processing of the individual disbursement vouchers.



During the exit conference, the Chief Accountant assured the Audit Team the full and timely remittances of the GSIS insurance premiums and loan amortizations withheld every month.



Withholding and remittance of PhilHealth contributions and employer’s share



14)	The PhilHealth personal shares amounting to P4.428 million were deducted properly and remitted without delay but not in full amount. Of the personal shares withheld of P4.428 million, only P4.108 was remitted to the PhilHealth together with the employer’s share of P3.591 million, which is not in accordance with the provisions in RA No. 7875, as amended by RA No. 9241. As of December 31, 2020, the agency still has a balance of P0.425 million, composed of P0.320 million and P0.105 million for the current year and prior years’ unremitted balances, respectively, and the latter is still subject for reconciliation.

RA No. 9241, an Act Amending RA No. 7875, otherwise known as the “National Health Insurance Act of 1995” dated June 19, 2013 provides the following rules:



Section 20 (b) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the National Health Insurance Act of 1995 provides that:



“The monthly premium contribution of employed members shall be remitted by the employer on or before the tenth (10th) calendar day of the month following the applicable month for which the payment is due and applicable.”



During the year, the agency withheld PhilHealth contributions from the compensation of its officials and employees amounting to P4.428 million and employer’s share amounted to P3.591 million, or a total amount of P8.019 million. Of this amount, remittances made was only P7.699 million, though without delays but not in full amount. Thus, as of December 31, 2020, the agency has an unremitted balance of P0.425 million, comprising of P0.320 million and P0.105 million for the current year and prior years, respectively, and the latter is subject for reconciliation and validation.

The above discrepancies were due to the exclusion of the premiums from the salaries of personnel with absences without pay, newly promoted and/or suspended whose salaries were processed in the subsequent month through individual disbursement vouchers. Likewise, contributions of Job Order personnel who are senior citizens were also adjusted since the same are exempted from PhilHealth contributions.



The incomplete remittances of the PhilHealth employees’ shares is not in conformity with the provisions contained in RA No. 7875, as amended by RA No. 9241 or the National Health Insurance Act of 1995.

	

Thus, the Agency is not compliant, in all material respect, with Section 28 of RA 7875 as amended by RA 9241 and Section 20(b) of the IRR as regards the full remittances of the withheld employees’ insurance premiums within the 10th Calendar Day of the month following the applicable month, respectively.

		

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountant to:

		

a)		ensure full/complete remittance of the amount of insurance premium contributions withheld in a month; and



b)	instruct the bookkeeper to include deduction from salaries of individuals paid through disbursement vouchers in the monthly remittances to the PhilHealth.



Withholding and remittance of Pag-IBIG contributions, loans and employer’s share

	

15)	The Pag-IBIG personal share and loan amortizations of employees amounting to P4.575 million were properly deducted and remitted without delay but not in full amount, thereby leaving a balance of P0.199 million at year-end, which is not in accordance with Section 3 RA No. 7875, as amended by RA No. 9679 (HDMF Fund Law 2009). Likewise, government share of P0.770 million, were also remitted without delay.



Rule VII. Collection and Remittance. - IRR of RA No. 9679 or Home Development Mutual Fund Law of 2009, otherwise known as PAG-IBIG Fund dated July 21, 2009 provides that:



Section 1. The employer assumes a fiduciary relationship with both the Fund and the member concerned as regards the latter’s contribution and the required employer contribution, as well as the remittance thereof to the Fund.



Section 2. Monthly contributions of members to the Fund shall be collected through payroll deductions by their respective employers, who for this purpose shall act as agent both of the Fund and the member.



Section 3. All employers shall remit to the Fund their contributions and the contributions of their covered employees as well as the latter’s loan amortizations or payments to the Fund, as provided for under Section 2 of this Rule, when applicable, within fifteen (15) days from the date the same were collected unless another period is previously agreed upon between the employer and the Fund, or within such periods as the Fund may prescribe otherwise. Xxx…. non-payment thereof shall subject the employer to a penalty of three percent (3%) per month of the amounts payable from the date the contributions fall due until paid xxx and from the date the loan amortizations or payments fall due until paid.



During the year, the agency withheld the Pag-IBIG contributions from its officials and employees and loan payments amounting to P4.575 million (net of refunds) and remitted the amount of P5.336 million, inclusive of employees’ personal share of P4.566 million and government share of P0.770 million, within the prescribed period of fifteen days, but not in full amounts, leaving an unremitted amount of P0.199 million, of which P0.009 pertains to current year and P0.190 million unremitted balance for the previous year.

The unremitted balance at year-end was due to the failure of the bookkeeper in-charge of remittances to include the individual payments on salary differentials paid thru disbursement vouchers in their remittances.



In our assessment, the non-remittance in full of the amounts withheld for Pag-IBIG contributions and loan amortizations was due to the lack of monitoring/analysis of the account balances due to absence of subsidiary ledgers.



Thus, the Agency is not compliant, in all material respects, with the provisions under Section 3 of RA No. 7875, as amended by RA No. 9679 or the Pag-IBIG Fund Law of 2009.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountant to:



a)	ensure full and timely remittances of the Pag-BIG contributions and loan amortizations every month to include deductions from salary differentials paid through individual disbursement vouchers in the monthly remittances to the Pag-IBIG. Otherwise, any penalty for late remittance shall be imposed with the erring official and employees;

	

b)	track the prior year’s balances and immediately remit to the Pag-IBIG the amount, and make adjustments in the books of accounts to reflect the correct balance of the Due to Pag-IBIG account; and



c)	maintain updated subsidiary ledgers for each employees’ deductions and monitor the account balances regularly.



In January 2021, the agency remitted the amount of P0.199 million pertaining to the December withheld amounts but was reflected in the GL for December 2020.



Withholding and remittance of taxes



16)	The agency withheld the amount of P23.549 million from employees’ compensation and P43.634 million from suppliers’ income on contracts, and remitted the amount of P18.470 million and P30.647 million, respectively, within the prescribed period. However, the agency has an unremitted balance amounting to P32.884 million consisting of P18.066 million for current year and P14.818 million for prior years unremitted amounts, the latter is subject for validation and reconciliation.



Revenue Regulation No. 10-2008 dated July 8, 2008 requires government agencies to withhold taxes from employees’ earning from compensation, suppliers’ income on contracts and to remit the taxes withheld within the 10th day of the following month to the account of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). Agencies are also obliged to submit the Tax Remittance Advice (TRA) on payments withheld from agency appropriations. Accountants are obliged to see to it that all withheld taxes are adjusted to actual taxes due, remitted, and recorded in the books of accounts during the year. Details as follows:

	However, the taxes withheld on gross compensation and government purchases were not fully remitted, leaving a balance of P5.079 million and P12.987 million, respectively, or a total amount of P18.066 million. Hence, the total unremitted balance as of the December 31, 2020 was P32.884 million, which includes the current year’s and prior years’ unremitted balances of P18.066 million and P14.818 million, respectively, as shown in the above table.



Inquiry revealed that the unremitted balances were due to the failure of the bookkeeper in-charge of tax remittances to include in their tax remittance advice the individual payments on salary differentials paid thru disbursement vouchers amounting to P5.09 million and overlooked some of the taxes withheld from suppliers amounting to P12.987 million.



However, the non-remittance in full of the taxes withheld was due to the absence of subsidiary ledgers, which resulted in the lack of monitoring/analysis of the account balances.



Thus, the Agency is not compliant, in all material respects, with the provisions under Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Revenue Regulation No. 10-2008 dated July 8, 2008.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountant to:



a)	ensure full and timely remittances of the taxes withheld every month to include deductions from salary differentials paid through disbursement vouchers in the monthly remittances to the BIR; and



b)	maintain updated subsidiary ledgers for each employees’ deductions and monitor the account balances regularly.



Management commented that the Accounting Section has prepared forms and submitted to the BIR website; remitted the supplier’s withholding taxes in the amounts of P10.429 million and P0.771 million in January 7, 2021 and April 5, 2021, respectively; adjusted the General Ledger for the overstatement of P0.100 million; and checked and verified the discrepancies on tax compensation and noted the causes.



However, the updating of subsidiary ledgers for each employee and reconciliation of the account is still on-going.



	Improper Withholding of Taxes on Professional Services

	

17)	The 15 contracts on professional services, which amounted to P359.742 million, entered into by and between the NAMRIA and four (4) contractors, were not properly deducted with applicable taxes in accordance with Section 2 of RR No. 11-2018 dated January 31, 2018 and Section 4-114-2 of Revenue Regulations No. 13-2018, resulting in the over-payments of contracts and under-withholding of taxes by P 40.888 million.



Section 2 of Revenue Regulation No. 11-2018 as renumbered and further amended Section 2.57.2 of RR No. 2-98 to be read as follows: 



“except as herein otherwise provided, there shall be withheld a creditable income tax at the rates herein specified for each class of payee from the following items of income payments to persons residing in the Philippines.



For professional fees, talent fees, etc., for services rendered by Management and Technical consultants which are non-individual payee and whose gross income for the current year exceeded P720,000.00, the creditable income tax is 15%.



Section 4-114-2 of Revenue Regulations No. 13-2018 dated March 15, 2018 provides for the Withholding of Value-added Tax on Government Money Payments (GMP) and Payments to Non-Residents. It states that:



Withholding of Value-added Tax. “Government or any of its political subdivisions, instrumentalities or agencies, including government owned or – controlled corporations (GOCCs) shall, before making payment on account of each purchase of goods and services which are subject to the value-added tax imposed in Section 106 and 108 of this Code, deduct and withhold the value-added tax imposed in Section 106 and 108 of this Code, deduct and withhold a final value-added tax at the rate of five percent (5%) of the gross payment thereof: provided, that beginning January 1, 2021, the VAT withholding system under this subsection shall shift from final to a creditable system:x x x”.



Audit disclosed that the Accounting Section applied the tax rates of 2% and 5% for CWT and final valued-added tax on GMP, respectively, or a total of 7%, in lieu of the 15% and 5%, or a total 20% for Management and Technical Consultants, as provided for in Section 2 of Revenue Regulation No. 11-2018 and Section 4-114-2 of Revenue Regulations No. 13-2018, respectively, on the payments for the 15 contracts on professional services during the year amounting to P359.742 million to four (4) contractors.



The table below shows, on a per contractor and project contracted basis, the difference between the total actual taxes withheld from the various payments made to the consultants for services rendered during calendar year 2020 against the total taxes that should have been withheld per computation of the Audit Team, as follows:

Inquiry disclosed that the Accountant used the tax rates applicable for the procurement of goods as the contracts were classified by the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) as procurement of goods instead of Consulting Services.



However, our audit disclosed that the 15 contracts fall on the category of Professional Services, specifically on the Consulting Services and not of procurements of goods on the grounds provided in 2016 RIRR of RA 9184, the Procurement Act of 1995, specifically the following:



a)	Annex B, paragraph 2 provides that:



"the services of the consultants may be engaged by any procuring entity for government projects or related activities of such magnitude and/or scope as would require a level of expertise or attention beyond the optimum in-house capability of the procuring entity concerned and consistent with the Government's policy not to compete with the private sector."



b)	Section 5, letter “i” defines Consulting Services as:



“Refer to services for infrastructure projects and other types of projects or activities of the GoP requiring adequate external technical and professional expertise that are beyond the capability and/or capacity of the GoP to undertake such as, but not limited to: (i) advisory and review services; (ii) preinvestment or feasibility studies; (iii) design; (iv) construction supervision; (v) management and related services; and (vi) other technical services or special studies. General principles on Consulting Services are provided for in Annex “B” of this IRR.”

	

c)	Section 6.6, Annex B further provides that one of the types of consulting services is Other Technical Services or Special Studies, to wit:



The Special Studies may include the following and other studies not covered under any of the services and studies described above:



a)	xxx

d) 	Land surveys, establishment of boundaries and monuments, and related office computations and drafting;

e) 	Parcellary surveys;

f) 	Engineering surveys (for design and construction) and photogrammetry;

g)	xxx”



d)	On the other hand, Section 5, letter “r” defines Goods as:



“all items, supplies, materials and general support services, except Consulting Services and infrastructure projects, which may be needed in the transaction of public businesses or in the pursuit of any government undertaking, project or activity, whether in the nature of equipment, furniture, stationery, materials for construction, or personal property of any kind, including non-personal or contractual services, such as, the repair and maintenance of equipment and furniture, as well as trucking, hauling, janitorial, security, and related or analogous services, as well as procurement of materials and supplies provided by the Procuring Entity for such services. xxx.”



Likewise, contract review performed for the 15 Contracts for Professional Services costing P359.742 million, disclosed the similar Scope of Work in all contracts, which falls on the category of a Consulting Services, as defined in Section 5(i) of the IRR of RA 9184, and shown below:

Our analysis of the Work Orders, Annual Procurement Plan (APP) and Contract documents disclosed that the scope of works performed by the contractors were all related to land surveys, parcellary surveys, engineering surveys and photogrammetry, therefore these fall under the category of consulting services, which is under the “Other Technical Services or Special Studies”, as provided in Section 6 of the abovementioned RIRR. Also, the schedule of payments were based on the percentage of works accomplished and not on a one time basis as in the case of goods and the very nature of works performed are highly technical.



It must be emphasized that the services that can only be classified as procurement of “goods” are the general support services pursuant to Section 5(r) of the RIRR, which are not highly technical in nature, as in the case of these subject contracts.



Likewise, in Item 18.9 of the Notes to Financial Statement, the payments for large-scale Orthoimages and Topographic Maps were classified as Other Professional Services and not as Supplies and Materials Expenses as in the case of goods.



Thus, the classification of the procurement of 15 contracts for the outsourcing of the production of large scale Orthoimages and Topographic Maps as “goods” instead of “professional services” resulted in the overpayment of contract amounts and the under-withholding of taxes by P40.888 million, computed as follows:

We recommended that Management:



a)	comply with the provisions of the RIRR of RA 9184 as regards the classification of projects to be bidded and ensure that the categorization of contracts are consistent with the Approved Annual Procurement Plan; and



b)	collect from the contractors the overpayments made in the amount of P40.888 million and remit the same to the BIR in accordance with existing revenue regulations.



Management commented that the subject procurement could not fall under consultancy services due to the fact that as the national mapping agency of the government, NAMRIA is the sole and exclusive agency in government that possesses the necessary skills, expertise and attention in the production of maps for the UMP and other map-related products. It is the NAMRIA itself which develops the designs, technical standards and specifications for geodetic control surveys and production of the digital maps and other products to be delivered by the contractors. Before the start of each project, the contractor’s technical team are thoroughly briefed by NAMRIA personnel on the detailed technical specifications to be followed, the software to be used and the expected deliverables. It is only through these NAMRIA projects where the contractors were able to gain knowledge in producing topographic maps and the proper method of geodetic surveying.



The management also clarified that the engagement of the contractors is not anchored on their supposed technical expertise, which NAMRIA already has at its disposal, but for its lack of sufficient manpower given the extent and large coverage of these projects.



According to management, the subject procurement projects does not fall under definition of “Consulting Services” in Section 5(i) of the Revised IRR, which is defined as “services for infrastructure projects and other types of projects or activities of the GoP requiring adequate external technical or professional expertise that are beyond the capability and/or capacity of the GoP to undertake such, as, but not limited to: (i) advisory and review supervision; (v) management and related services; and ((vi) other technical services or special studies…”.



It was pointed out by management that the deliverables expected of and eventually submitted by the contractors are considered Goods since these are items to be used in the pursuit of government projects or activities. Besides, the delivered items are not yet the end-product in itself but will still be used by NAMRIA as input in producing the final output. In the case of the UMP, the delivered products will still undergo several processes and cartographic enhancements before the final maps are produced. For geodetic control surveys, the coordinates submitted will still be processed before being generated into the national geodetic control network. These items therefor will fall under “other services” that are essential to the operation of the NAMRIA.



They also cited Resolution No. 29-2013 dated October 25, 2013 of the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) entitled “Reiterating the Position of the Government Procurement Policy Board on the Nature of Mixed Procurement”, which states that the GPPB agreed to adopt the recommendation of the IATWG that in the case of mixed procurements, the nature of procurement shall be determined based on the primary purpose of the contract, based on the following reasons:



a)	That the procuring entity (PE) is in the best position to determine the correct classification for its procurement based on its identified needs and the best way by which these needs may be addressed, managed and satisfied;



b)	That PEs are capable of discerning whether the procurement involves primarily procurement of “goods, infrastructure projects” or “consulting services.”



However, the Audit Team would like to stress that before these contractors can deliver the updated maps and other deliverables, they shall perform tasks that are highly technical in nature, as evidenced by the contracts’ terms of reference, such as: 1. Project Planning, monitoring and reporting; 2. Image acquisition, data gathering, and pre-processing; 3. Ground control surveys for establishment of image control and check points.4. Image processing, orthorectification, and mosaicking, etc.



Moreover, the Audit Team maintained its position that the subject contracts are categorized as professional services and not as “mixed procurements” as Management asserts in its letter on April 12, 2021 since there is no document that proves that indeed these contracts were for the procurement of goods. The work orders and the scope of works in all contracts falls under consultancy services as defined in Section 5(i) and as provided in Item 6.6, Annex B of the RIRR. Moreover, per Annual Procurement Plan (APP), the outsourcing of said projects were programmed as Professional Services and not as “mixed” procurement while in the Notes to FS it is classified as Other Professional Services. In any case, Professional fee for non-individual payee, if gross income exceeds P720,000.00, is fifteen percent (15%) as required in Revenue Regulation (RR) No. 11-2018 and a final value-added tax on GMP at the rate of five percent (5%) on gross payment per RR No. 13-2018.



We may agree on Management’s assertion that the engagement of the contractors is not anchored on their supposed technical expertise, which NAMRIA already has at its disposal, but for its lack of sufficient manpower given the extent and large coverage of these projects. It simply implies that NAMRIA lack the capacity to perform the activities, hence they engaged into contracts with four (4) Surveying Firms for the 15 projects costing P359.742 million, which requires adequate external technical or professional expertise to handle the works.



It should also be pointed out that before the contractors can deliver the updated maps and deliverables stipulated in the TOR, they shall perform tasks that are highly technical in nature, which falls within the definition of consulting services under Section 5(i) of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 while the services that falls under the category of goods, as defined in Section 5( r) of the RIRR, are those of general support services in nature.



In view of the above, the audit team finds the contracts as procurement of professional services instead of procurement of goods, thus the applied tax rates of 2% and 5% for CWT and GMP, respectively, for goods or a total of 7%, in lieu of the 15% and 5%, or 20% for professional fee were improper.



Thus, Notices of Disallowance amounting to P40.888 million were issued representing over-payments due to improper application of tax rates that resulted in the under-deduction of taxes.



Hiring of and payments to job orders, contractual and consultants



18)	The agency hired 162 individuals covered with Contract of Service (COS) or Job Order (JO) as of December 31, 2020 on a semestral basis, in accordance with CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No.1 dated June 15, 2017, as updated by CSC COA-DBM-Joint Circular No. 2, s. 2020 dated October 20, 2020, to augment the regular plantilla employees of 645, due to lack of plantilla position. Their salaries were charged against Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) in the total amount of P457.762 million, as authorized under DBM Circular Letter (CL) No. 2013-5 dated July 22, 2013.

	

Gender and Development (GAD) Plan and Implementation

	

19)	The agency allocated in its GAD Plan and Budget an amount of P14.342 million or only 0.85 percent of the total appropriations of ₱1,689.997 million, which is below the required attribution of at least 5% of its annual budget. Moreover, the GAD actual expenditures amounted to P27.799 million, which is only 1.65 percent of of its CY 2020 budget of ₱1,689.997 million due to the disapproval by the PCW of the two GAD attributed projects amounting to ₱59.328 million.



Section 31, General Provisions of RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020 mandates all agencies of the government to formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate, which shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. Further, activities currently undertaken by agencies which relate to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsiveness governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.



	COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 provides that: “The Audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit Team assigned to the agency within five (5) working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the PCW or their mother or central offices, as the case maybe.

	

	PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 provides under Item 7.0 that: “FY 2020 GAD ARs submitted to PCW shall be authenticated by the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) with a barcode. Concerned agencies shall print the GMMS-authenticated GAD AR for signature of their agency head and submit signed copies to PCW and their respective COA Audit Team.”

	

As required in the general provision of the CY 2020 GAA, the agency formulated a GPB, which was reviewed and endorsed by the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) of Philippine Commission on Women (PCW).



The planned activities per PCW reviewed/endorsed GPB amounted to ₱14.342 million only or 0.85 percent of its approved budget of ₱1,689.997 million for CY 2020. This falls short of the mandatory rate of five (5) percent under the above-cited regulation.



The GAD Focal person explained that the under allocation of the budget of the agency’s GPB was due to the disapproval by the PCW of the two (2) attributed projects, namely: Land Cover Mapping and Geospatial Data Infrastructure, therefore, affecting the budgetted amount in its GPB. The aforesaid projects were rejected by the PCW for the reason of no gender issues. However, these were still attributed by the Agency to GAD activities in its annual accomplishments report.

	

During the year, the agency reported an attributed accomplishments of P87.127 million for their GAD activities, which exceeded the GPB of P72.785 million or 5.16 percent of its 2020 budget, however, two of these projects, with total expenditures of P59.328 million, were among the projects disapproved by the PCW in the GMMS.

	*Disapproved by the PCW

	

Thus, the under-allocation of the budget of the GPB is not in compliance with Section 31 of RA 11465 and JC No. 2012-01, which requires that GAD planning shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, the cost of implementation of which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their total budgets.



Likewise, with the disapproval of the two GAD attributed projects having a total expenditures of P59.328 million, the actual GAD expenditures, both direct and attributed, was only P27.799 million, which is only 1.65% of its CY 2020 annual budget of ₱1,689.997 million, therefore, the Agency is not compliant with the five percent expenditure requirements.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the GAD Focal person to:



	a)	ensure that the programs/projects considered in the GPB have gender issues to meet with the required attribution of at least 5% of the total budget of the agency in compliance with the General Provisions of the GAA and JC No. 2012-01; and



	b)	ensure that only PCW approved programs are listed as attributed programs in the GAD Accomplishments Report.



Management commented that they are exerting its best efforts to integrate gender perspectives and to mainstream GAD in all its programs, activities and projects (PAPs), especially in the agency’s technical branches.



They also informed the Audit Team that the GAD Focal Person was directed to ensure that: 1) the programs/projects considered in the GAD Plan and Budget have gender issues to meet the required attribution of at least 5% of the total budget of the agency in compliance with the General Provisions of the GAA and JC No. 2012-01; and 2) PCW approved programs are listed as attributed programs in the GAD Accomplishments Report.



Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability (SCPD)



20)	The agency spent P0.042 million in the implementation of the activities for the Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability (SCPD), in addition to providing ramps, a wheelchair and priority lane for them, in compliance with Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020.



Implementation of ODA Funded Projects



21)	The agency did not receive and disburse funds for the implementation of ODA Funded projects during the year.



Receipt and utilization of Disaster Related Fund



22)	The agency did not receive and disburse funds for the Disaster Risk Reduction Management Fund and/or Quick Response Fund.

	

	Audit suspension, disallowances and charges

	

23)	There were no unsettled audit suspensions, disallowances and charges in the prior years. However, Notices of Suspensions (NS) and Notices of Disallowances (NDs) issued for the CY 2020 transactions, which were audited after the reporting date, amounted to P14.466 million and P 40.888 million, respectively.



24)	The NSs pertain to the payments of incentive allowance sourced from trust fund projects’ savings, without valid supporting documents while the NDs pertain to the over-payments of 15 contracts on the Outsourcing for the production of new series large-scale Orthoimages and Topographics Maps, due to improper application of tax rates on the creditable withholding tax (CWT) and the final VAT on government money payments (GMP), as discussed above. The NDs are subject for appeal within six (6) months from date of issue.
