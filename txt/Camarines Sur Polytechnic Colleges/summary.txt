Introduction



The Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges (CSPC) is a state, non-sectarian, and non-profit educational institution of higher learning established by virtue of Batas Pambansa (BP) Bilang 512 as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 8292. Its mandate is to provide higher technological, professional, and vocational instruction and training in fisheries, trade and technology, arts and sciences, as well as short term technical and vocational courses as the Board of Trustees may deem necessary. Its institutional blueprint, which is in accord with its philosophy: “Education for Economic Development and Social Progress,” is the development of a critical mass of quality manpower in the area through ladderized curricula in trades and technology and arts and sciences.



In calendar year (CY) 2002, pursuant to the provision of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Fiscal Year (FY) 2002 budget under the General Appropriations Act (GAA) FY 2000, the former Bicol College of Arts and Trades was converted to CSPC Naga City Campus pursuant to CSPC Board of Trustees (BOT) Resolution No. 00-044.



On October 19, 2012, RA No. 10231 was approved separating CSPC-Naga City Campus from CSPC Main Campus in Nabua and converting the former into what is now known as the Bicol State College of Applied Science and Technology (BISCAST). 



CSPC also opened its extension campus in Buhi, Camarines Sur in response to the quest of the Local Government of Buhi to make college education accessible to the underprivileged but deserving students of the municipality under BOT Resolution No. 08-439 approved on February 28, 2008.



RA No. 11283 entitled “An Act Converting the Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges (CSPC) in the Municipality of Nabua, Province of Camarines Sur, into a State University to be known as the Polytechnic State University of Bicol and appropriating Funds therefor, was approved and signed by President Rodrigo R. Duterte on April 12, 2019.  However, it is noteworthy to mention that despite the approval of the Republic Act, the college could not yet adopt its new name as a University due to the non-issuance of the Certification by the CHED to the effect as the school was not able to submit some required documents.



The  Main  Campus  offers   graduate  programs  in  Masters  in  Engineering (ME), Engineering   Technology (MET), Business Management (MBM) and Nursing (MAN); Bachelor Degree Programs in Electrical Engineering, Mechanical  Engineering,  Civil Engineering,  Electronics Engineering, Information Technology, Computer Science, Library Information Science, Science in Information System, Nursing and Midwifery, Office Administration, Hospitality Management, Tourism Management, Entrepreneurial Management; and Mathematics, Arts in Language, Technical-Vocational Teacher Education.



Presently, the administration of the College is vested in its President, Dr. Charlito P. Cadag, with the able and competent help from his three Vice-Presidents, namely:  Dr. Maria Laarni M. Salcedo (VP for Academic Affairs), Mr. Ferdinand B. Valencia (VP for Administration and Finance) and Dr. Teresita B. Salazar (VP for Research, Extension, Production and Entrepreneurial Development). These officials, together with over 300 academic and administrative personnel deployed in the Nabua, and Buhi campuses, steer the College to sustainable, efficient and effective operations. 





Scope of Audit



The audit was conducted to: (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.



Financial and Compliance audit covered the accounts and operations of the State College for the period January 1 to December 31, 2020, conducted on test basis.

Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



We rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the College’s financial statements for CY 2020 because:



1)	Prior year’s audit observation on the non-reconciliation of the Accounting and Inventory Custodian’s records remained unacted upon, contrary to pertinent accounting and auditing rules and regulations, thus, accuracy and reliability of the balances of inventory accounts totaling ₱16.05 million cannot be ascertained. Likewise, the unit value of 1,401 pieces of six different items classified under Other Supplies and Materials Inventory was not indicated in the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI), thus, understating the total cost of inventories. 



2)	The correctness and reliability of the balances of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts carried in the books at gross cost of ₱640.25 million as of December 31, 2020 were doubtful due to the non-reconciliation of the accounting and property records, inability to derecognize the disposed properties amounting to ₱4.05 million and inclusion as PPE of items below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000. Likewise, the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) includes unserviceable properties already disposed.  



3)	Other Payables account with General Ledger balance of ₱35.00 million as of December 31, 2020 is doubtful due to the absence of necessary supporting documents and updated subsidiary ledgers/schedules hindering the verification and reconciliation of balances, thus, accuracy and reliability of the account balance reflected in the financial statement could not be ascertained. 





Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



For the exceptions mentioned earlier, we recommended that Management: 



1)	Comply with the following courses of action:



a)	Require the Accounting Office to maintain and update the recording of the receipts, issuances and corresponding balances in the Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs). It shall be maintained to facilitate reconciliation with Supply Office at any given time.; and



b)	Require the Accounting and Supplies Offices to conduct periodic reconciliation of their respective records to ensure reliability of the inventory account balances. Trace the discrepancies and effect the necessary adjustments on the affected inventory accounts, including those inventory items with no unit cost/value.  



2)	Require the Accountant and Property Officer to:

 

a)	Reconcile the RPCPPE with the General Ledger Balances and make the necessary adjustments for the discrepancies noted in audit amounting to ₱13.17 million, to present the correct PPE account balance in their respective books and records; 



b)	Prepare adjusting entries to derecognize the PPEs already disposed amounting to ₱4.05 million; 

 

c)	Remove from the PPE accounts, items amounting to ₱84,340 which are below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000 and classify them as inventory items pursuant to Section 4, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume 1; and  



d)	 Prepare adjusting entries to correct the overstatement of asset and equity accounts for those semi-expendable property already issued to end-users and supported with duly accomplished Inventory Custodian Slips (ICS).



3)	Require the Accountant to:



a)	Analyze, investigate and substantiate the validity and existence of the recorded prior years’ transactions taken up under Other Payables account. Also, prepare a complete and updated Schedule or SL thereof and make the necessary adjusting entries to reflect the correct classification of the account; and

 

b)	Revert to the National Treasury any payable amounts already dormant for two years or more with no valid claimants/supporting documents. 



Moreover, the following are the notable observations and the corresponding recommendations:



1)	The accuracy and reliability of the Due to NGAs account balance of ₱7.86 million as of December 31, 2020 cannot be ascertained due to the absence of supporting documents, non-preparation of subsidiary ledgers/schedules, and inability to deduct from the account all liquidations and refund of the unutilized funds to the Source Agencies, contrary to COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020, Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and GAM for NGAs. 



We recommended that Management require the Accounting Office to: 

 

a)	Exert effort in retrieving the documents and records pertaining to the funds received from the College’s files if there is any or request a copy from the source agency; 



b)	Prepare and maintain subsidiary ledgers which aid in monitoring and detecting errors/omissions on specific accounts;  



c)	Reconcile records with the concerned source agencies and effect necessary adjustments in the books for accurate account balances; and 



d)	Henceforth, ensure that financial transactions are accurately recorded in the accounting books. 



2)	Management was not able to enforce/exercise the remedies provided in the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 9184 for lapses in the implementation of various infrastructure projects resulting in possible loss of government funds.



We recommended that Management: 

 

a)	Cause the immediate termination of the contract for the abandoned infrastructure project Center for Innovation and Technology Development (CITD Phase III) and award the contract to another qualified contractor; 

 

b)	Forfeit the contractor’s performance security and initiate the suspension or blacklisting of defaulting contractor in accordance with the guidelines issued by the GPPB; 

 

c)	Conduct preliminary detailed engineering activities thoroughly for future infrastructure projects and ensure that present and past issues that contribute to the delay in the project implementation are resolved prior to the procurement and construction of the infrastructure projects; 

  

d)	Require the Project Engineers to monitor closely and supervise the project implementation in accordance with the plans, specifications and timelines, and institute appropriate penalties, where necessary, to protect the interest of the government;  

 

e)	Require the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) and Technical Working Group (TWG) to thoroughly and strictly review the post-qualification of Contractors in terms of manpower, equipment requirements and performances on ongoing and completed government and private civil works contracts; and 



f)	Submit explanation why the CITD building, which was not yet completed and accepted, was already repaired out of the fund Special Trust Fund (STF) for CY 2020. 



3)	Buildings constructed and completed in CYs 2017 and 2019 in the total amount of ₱139.16 million were being utilized/occupied despite the absence of the necessary Building and Occupancy permits required under Sections 301 and 309, Chapter III of PD No. 1096. 



We recommended that Management: 

 

a)	Immediately follow up the building permits and thereafter secure the occupancy permits of the completed constructed building to ensure their conformity to safety and other standard requirements; and 

 

b)	Strictly comply with the Building Code requirements by securing building permits prior to commencing the construction of buildings and structures.  



4)	Registries to monitor the budget were not complete and not compliant with the format prescribed under pertinent provisions of the GAM for NGAs Volumes I and II, posing difficulty in the verification and reconciliation of the balances reflected in the Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs).   



We recommended that Management require the Budget Officer to prepare and maintain all the registries in the format prescribed under the GAM for NGAs.  



5)	Productivity Incentive Allowance totaling ₱1.4 million granted to 242 employees as PRAISE incentive was contrary to item 6 of CSC MC No. 01 s. 2001 due to absence of proof that suggestions, inventions, superior accomplishments and other personal efforts result in monetary savings which shall not exceed 20% of the savings generated. 









We recommended that Management: 

 

			a)	Submit documents to show that there were acceptable exemplary achievements which resulted in monetary savings that made the personnel of the College eligible to receive said incentive; 



			b)	Submit proof that there were available savings from Personnel Services of the General Appropriations Act in FY 2020; and



			c)	Refrain from granting allowances, benefits and incentives without legal basis to avoid possible disallowance in audit. 





The afore cited observations and recommendations were discussed with concerned officials of the Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges (CSPC) during the exit conference held on May 7, 2021. Management views and reactions were considered in the Report, where appropriate.
