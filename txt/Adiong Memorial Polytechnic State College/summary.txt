C. Scope of Audit 
 

A financial and compliance audit was conducted on the accounts and operations 

of the Adiong Memorial Polytechnic State College for the year ended December 31, 

2020. The audit was aimed at ascertaining the validity and propriety of disbursements 

as well as the reliability and fairness of the auditee’s financial records and reports and 

its compliance to laws, rules and regulations. 

  

 

D. Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements  
 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of 

the financial statements of the AMPSC for CY 2020, in view of the effects of the 

material exception observed in the course of our audit which is stated in the Independent 

Auditor’s report and discussed in detail under Part II of this report.  

 

 

E. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The details of major significant audit findings, observation and 

recommendations for the year 2020 are as follows: 

 

1. Management failed to submit Budget and Financial Accountability Reports 
(BFARs) pursuant to Section 7.1.1 (a) of the COA Circular No. 2009-006 

dated September 15, 2009, Sections 31 and 32, Chapter 3, Volume I of the 

Government Accounting Manual (GAM) and COA-DBM Joint 

Memorandum Circular No. 2014-1 dated July 2, 2014 which resulted to 

failure to review and evaluate the financial reports as against the Budget 

for the CY 2020. 

 

We recommended the Agency Head to require the Accountant and the Budget 

Officer to prepare and submit a Budget and Financial Accountability Reports 

(BFARs) as prescribed in Chapter 3, Volume I of the Government Accounting 

Manual (GAM) and COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2014-1 dated July 2, 2014 to 

the Auditor or his representative. 

 

2. The accuracy, correctness and reliability of the Property, Plant and 
Equipment (PPE) account amounting to ₱182,524,995.39 as at December 

31, 2020 was doubtful due to the failure of Management to conduct yearly 

physical inventory of PPE and non-preparation and submission of physical 

inventory reports, contrary to Section 38, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM 

for National Government Agencies (NGAs). 

 

 

 

 



 
 
 

iii 
 

 

We recommended that the Management: 

 

a) To conduct physical inventory of all its Property, Plant and Equipment 
every end of the year, in accordance with Section 38, Chapter 10, 

Volume I of the GAM for NGAs; 

 

b) Based on the actual inventory, the Physical Inventory Committee should 
prepare and submit RPCPPE to the Audit Team on time, using the 

prescribed format; and 

 

c) Instruct the Accounting and Property/Supply Office to maintain/update 
the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Cards (PPELC) and 

Supply/Property Cards, respectively and always reconcile their records. 

 

 

3. The accuracy, correctness and reasonableness of charges made to Fuel, Oil 
and Lubricants Expenses account for the year ended December 31, 2020 

amounting to ₱210,000.00 could not be ascertained due to the failure of the 

Management to submit a Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption, contrary 

to COA Circular No. 77-66. 

 

We recommended the Agency Head to require the person responsible to submit 

Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption to the Auditor to determine the 

reasonableness of fuel consumption during the period. Likewise, require the 

attachment of driver’s trip ticket to determine whether or not the fuel 

consumption is in connection with official trip.  

 

4. The Agency failed to submit or furnish copy of the Purchase Order (PO) to 
the Auditor’s Office within five (5) working days upon approval/perfection 

in violation of the provision of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 

12, 2009. This precluded the Auditor to conduct timely review of contracts, 

inspection of project and purchases, and communicate to Management 

defects/deficiencies noted. 

 

We recommended that Management furnish the Auditor a copy of the Purchase 

Order upon approval by the requesting officials and the Agency Head within 

five (5) working days after the approval together with accomplished supporting 

documents for technical review and evaluation in compliance with COA 

Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009. 

 

5. Management failed to notify the Audit Team of the time and date of every 
scheduled delivery of procurements on various supplies and materials in 

the total amount of ₱5,894,244.30 in contrary to Section 44 of P.D. 1445 and 

Section 6.6 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995. 

 



 
 
 

iv 
 

We recommended that Management shall notify the Auditor on the time and 

date of the delivery of goods and services to check the actual physical existence 

of the procured supplies and materials. 

 

6. The non-submission of a monthly Report of Accountability for Accountable 
Forms (RAAF) and monthly Consolidated Report of Accountability for 

Accountable Forms (CRAAF) in contrary to the provision of Sections 98, 

GAAM, Volume I, thereby exposing the accountable forms into possible 

loss or misuse. 

 

We recommended the Management to require the person responsible to prepare 

and submit a monthly Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) 

by each accountable officer having possession of the accountable forms for 

consolidation into a monthly Consolidated Report of Accountability for 

Accountable Forms (CRAAF) by the Cashier or Head of the Finance Unit. 

 

7. The agency failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of allocating 
at least five percent (5%) of the total appropriations for Gender and 

Development (GAD) programs, projects and activities contrary to 

Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 

and Section 31 of the General Provisions on RA No. 11465 (GAA for FY 

2020). 

 

We recommended the Management to: 

 

a) allocate at least five percent (5%) of the total annual budget for the 
implementation of Gender and Development (GAD) – related activities as 

required in the above cited provisions; and 

 

b) comply with the mandatory budget for GAD and lay down activities 
geared towards the attainment of GADs objectives, such as activities that 

contribute to poverty alleviation, women empowerment, and protection 

and promotion of women’ human rights. 

 

8. Status of Settlement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges. As 
of December 31, 2020, the Adiong Memorial Polytechnic State College had a 

total unsettled suspension of ₱2,927,371.00.  

 

 

F. Status of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 

Of the nineteen (19) audit recommendations embodied in the 2019 Annual Audit 

Report, six (6) were implemented, six (6) were not implemented, and seven (7) were 

partially implemented. The details of prior recommendations are exhibited in Part III of

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 

 

 

DR. SAADIA A. ADIONG, PhD 

Adiong Memorial Polytechnic State College 

Ditsaan Ramain, Lanao del Sur  

 

 

Qualified Opinion 

 

We have audited the financial statements of the Adiong Memorial Polytechnic State 

College (AMPSC), Ditsaan Ramain, Lanao del Sur, which comprise the Statement of 

Financial Position as at December 31, 2020, and the Statements of Financial Performance, 

Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity, Cash Flows, Comparison of Budget and Actual 

Amounts for the year then ended, and Notes to the Financial Statements, including a 

summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. 

 

In our opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the Basis for Qualified 

Opinion section of our report, the accompanying  financial  statements present fairly, in all 

material respects, the financial position of the Adiong Memorial Polytechnic State College 

as at December 31, 2020, and its financial performance, changes in net assets/equity, cash 

flows, comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended, and its notes to 

the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies in 

accordance with Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSASs). 

 

Basis for Qualified Opinion 

 

As discussed in Part II of this Report, our audit observation which affected the fair 

presentattion of the financial statement Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) as at 

December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱182,524,995.39 could not be ascertained due to non 

submission of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment 

(RPCPPE). 

 

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 

Institutions (ISSAIs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in 

the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our 

report. We are independent of the agency in accordance with the ethical requirements that 

are relevant to our audit of the financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 

responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence 

we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key Audit Matters 

 

Except for the matter disclosed in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section, we have 

determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report. 

 

Responsibilities of Management and those Charged with Governance for the 

Financial Statements 

 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial 

statements in accordance with Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standard (PPSAS), and 

for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation 

of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 

or error. 

 

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the agency’s financial 

reporting process.  

 

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 

 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 

as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 

issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level 

of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAI is 

will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 

fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 

reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis 

of these financial statements. 

 

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the amounts and 

disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's 

professional judgment, including the assessment of the risk of material misstatement of the 

financial statements whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the 

auditor considers internal control relevant to the agency's preparation and fair presentation 

of the financial statements  in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 

circumstances , but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 

agency' s internal control. Our audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of 

accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by 

management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 

3.1 Basis of accounting 

 

The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis in accordance 

with the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS). 

 

3.2 Financial Instruments 

 

Financial Assets 

 

Initial recognition and measurement 

 

Financial assets with a scope of PPSAS 29- Financial Instruments: 

Recognition and Measurement are classified as financial assets at fair 

value through surplus or deficits, held-to-maturity investments, loans 

and receivables or available for sale financial assets at initial recognition. 

 

Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets 

within a time frame established by the regulation or convention in the 

market place (regular way trades) are recognized on the trade date, i.e. 

the day that AMPSC commits to purchase or sell the assets. 

The AMPSC’s financial assets include: cash and short-term deposits; 

trade and other receivables; loans and other receivables. 

 

Subsequent measurement 

 

The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their 

classification. 

 

Loans and receivables 

  

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 

determinable payments that are quoted in an active market. 

 

Derecognition 

 

The AMPSC derecognizes a financial asset or, where applicable, a part 

of financial assets or part of AMPSC of similar financial assets when: 

• The right to receive the cash flows from the asset have expired 
or are waived. 

• The AMPSC has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from 
the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash 

flows in full without material delay to third party; and either: (a) 

AMPSC has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of 

 



11 
 

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Reference 

the asset; or (b) AMPSC has neither transferred nor retained 

substantially all the risks. 

 

Financial Liabilities 

 

Initial recognition and measurement 

 

Financial liabilities within the scope of PPSAS 29 are classified as 

financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit or loans and 

borrowings, as appropriate. The entity determines the classification of 

its financial liabilities at initial recognition. 

 

All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the 

case of loans and borrowings, plus directly attributable transaction costs. 

 

AMPSC’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables. 

 

Subsequent measurement 

 

The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their 

classification. 

 

Derecognition 

 

A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the 

liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 

 

3.3 Cash and cash equivalent 

 

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash at bank, 

deposits on call and highly liquid investments with an original maturity 

of three months or less which are readily convertible to known amounts 

of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For the 

purpose of the consolidated statement risk of cash flows, cash and cash 

equivalent consist of cash and short- term deposits as defined above, net 

of outstanding bank overdraft.  

 

3.4 Inventories 

 

Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition. To the extent that 

inventory was received through non- exchange transaction (for no cost 

or for a nominal cost), the cost of the inventory is its fair value at the 

date of acquisition. 

 



12 
 

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Reference 

Cost incurred in bringing each product to its present location and 

condition are accounted for, as follows: 

• Raw materials: purchase cost using the weighted average cost 

method 

• Finished goods and work in progress: cost of direct materials and 

labor and a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on the 

normal operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs. 

 

After initial recognition, inventory is measured at the lower of cost and 

net realizable value. However, to the extent that a class of inventory is 

distributed or deployed at no charge or for a nominal charge, that class 

of inventory is measured at the lower of cost and current replacement 

cost. 

 

Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course 

of operations, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated 

costs necessary to make the sale, exchange, or distribution. 

 

Inventories are recognized as an expense when deployed for utilization 

or consumption in the ordinary course of operations of the AMPSC. 

 

3.5 Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) 

 

Recognition 

An item is recognized as property, plant, and equipment (PPE) if it meets 

the characteristics and recognition criteria as a PPE. 

The characteristics of PPE are as follows: 

• Tangible items; 

• Are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, 

for rental to others, or for administrative purposes; and 

• are expected to be used more than one reporting period. 

 

An item of PPE is recognized as an asset if: 

• It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential 

associated with the item will flow to the entity; and 

• The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably. 

 

Measurement at Recognition 

 

An item recognized as property, plant and equipment is measured at cost. 

 

A PPE acquired through non- exchange transaction is measured at its 

fair value as at the date of acquisition. 

 



13 
 

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Reference 

The cost of the PPE is the cash price equivalent or, for PPE acquired 

through non- exchange transaction its cost as its fair value as at 

recognition date. 

 

Cost includes the following: 

• Its purchase price, including import duties and non- refundable 

purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates; 

• Expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the 

items; and 

• Initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item 

and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for 

which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired or as a 

consequence of having used the item during a particular period for 

purposes other than to produce inventories during that period. 

 

Measurement after Recognition 

 

After recognition, all property, plant and equipment are stated at cost 

less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 

 

When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to 

be replaced at intervals, the AMPSC recognizes such parts as individual 

assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. 

Likewise, when a major repair/ replacement is done, its cost is 

recognized in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a 

replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and 

maintenance costs are recognized as expenses in surplus or deficit as 

incurred.  

 

Depreciation 

 

Each part of an item of property, plant and Equipment with a cost is 

significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated 

separately. 

 

The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expenses unless 

it is included in the cost of another asset 

 

Initial Recognition of Depreciation 

 

Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when 

it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of 

operating in the manner intended by management. 

 



14 
 

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Reference 

For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation 

is for one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of 

the month. However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the 

month. Depreciation is for the succeeding month. 

 

Depreciation Method 

The straight line method of depreciation shall be adopted unless another 

method is more appropriate for agency operation. 

 

Estimated Useful Life 

 

The AMPSC uses the Schedule on the Estimated Useful Life of PPE by 

classification prepared by COA. 

 

The AMPSC uses a residual value equivalent to at least five percent (5%) 

of the cost of the PPE. 

 

Impairment 

 

An asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount, 

or recoverable service amount, if the asset’s carrying amount is greater 

than its estimated recoverable service amount. 

 

Derecognition 

 

The AMPSC derecognition items of property, plant and equipment 

and/or any significant part of an asset upon disposal or when no future 

economic benefits or service potential is expected from its continuing 

use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculate as 

the difference between the net disposal proceed and the carrying amount 

of the asset) is included in the surplus or deficit when the asset is 

derecognized. 

 

3.6 Changes in accounting policies and estimates 

 

The AMPSC recognizes the effects of changes in accounting policy 

retrospectively. The effects of changes in accounting policy are applied 

prospectively if retrospective application is impractical. 

 

AMPSC recognizes the effects of changes in accounting estimates 

prospectively by including in surplus and deficits. 

 

AMPSC correct material prior period errors retrospectively in the first 

set of financial statements authorized for issue after their discovery by: 

 



15 
 

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Reference 

• Relating comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in 
which the error occurs; or 

• If the error occurred before the earliest period presented, restating 
the opening balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for 

the earliest period presented. 

 

3.7 Revenue from non-exchange of transactions 

 

Recognition and Measurement of Assets from Non-Exchange 

Transactions 

 

An inflow of resources from non-exchange transaction, other than 

services in kind, that meets the definition of an assets were recognized 

as an assets if the following criteria are met: 

 

• It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential 
associated with the asset will flow to the entity; and 

• The fair value of the asset can be measured reliably. 
 

An asset acquired through a non-exchange transaction is initially 

measured at its fair value as the date of acquisition. 

 

Recognition of Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions 

 

An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction recognized as 

an asset is recognized as an asset is recognized as a revenue, except to 

the extent that a liability is also recognized in respect of the same inflow. 

 

As AMPSC satisfies a present obligation recognized as a liability in 

respect of an inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction 

recognized as an asset, it reduce the carrying amount of the liability 

recognized and recognizes an amount of revenue equal to that reduction. 

 

Measurement of Revenue from non-exchange transactions 

 

Revenue from non-exchange transactions is measured at the amount of 

the increase in net assets recognized by the entity, unless corresponding 

liability is recognized. 

 

Measurement of Liabilities on Initial Recognition from Non-

Exchange Transactions 

 

The amount recognized as a liability in a non-exchange transaction is the 

best estimate of the amount required to settle the present obligation at 

the reporting date. 



16 
 

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Reference 

 

Gifts and Donations 

 

The AMPSC recognizes assets and revenue from gifts and donations 

when it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential 

will flow to the entity and the fair value of the assets can be measured 

reliably. 

 

Goods-in-kind were recognized as an assets when the goods were 

received, or there is a binding arrangement to receive the goods. If 

goods-in-kind were received without conditions attached, revenue is 

recognized immediately. If conditions were attached, a liability is 

recognized, which is reduced and revenue recognized as the condition 

were satisfied. 

 

On the initial recognition, gifts and donations including goods-in-kind 

were measured at their fair value as the date of acquisition, which were 

ascertained by reference to an active market, or by appraisal. An 

appraisal of value of asset is normally undertaken by a member of the 

member of valuation profession who holds a recognized and relevant 

qualification. For many assets, the fair value were ascertained by 

reference to quoted prices in active and liquid market. 

 

Transfers from other government entities 

 

Revenues from non-exchange transactions with other government 

entities and the related assets were measured at fair value and recognized 

on obtaining control of the asset (cash, goods, services and properties) if 

the transfer is free from conditions and its probable that the economic 

benefits or service potential related to the asset will flow to the AMPSC 

and can be measured reliably. 

 

3.8 Revenue from Exchange Transactions 

 

Measurement of Revenue 

 

Revenue was measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 

receivable. 

 

Sales of Goods 

 

Revenue from sales of goods is recognized when the significant risks 

and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, usually on 

the delivery of the goods and when the amount of revenue can be 



17 
 

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Reference 

measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits or service 

potential associated with the transaction will flow to the AMPSC. 

 

Rental Income  

 

Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is 

accounted for on straight-line basis over the lease terms and included in 

revenue. 

 

3.9 Budget Information 

 

The annual budget is prepared on cash basis and is published in the 

government website. 

 

A separate Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts 

(SCBAA) was prepared since the budget and the financial statements 

were not prepared on comparable basis. 

 

3.10 Employee Benefits 

 

The employees of AMPSC are members of Government Service 

Insurance System (GSIS), Pag-Ibig and PhilHealth enjoying the benefits 

inherent in it. 

 

AMPSC recognizes the undiscounted amount of short term employee 

benefits, like salaries, wages, bonuses, allowances, etc., a expense unless 

capitalized, and as a liability after deducting the amount paid. 

 

AMPSC recognizes expense for accumulating compensated absences 

when these were paid as terminal leave benefits. Unused entitlements 

that have accumulated at the reporting date were not recognized as 

expense. Non-accumulating compensated absences, like special leave 

privileges were not recognized.

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A.     Financial and Compliance Audit 

 

1.     Management failed to submit Budget and Financial Accountability Reports 
(BFARs) pursuant to Section 7.1.1 (a) of the COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated 

September 15, 2009, Sections 31 and 32, Chapter 3, Volume I of the Government 

Accounting Manual (GAM) and COA-DBM Joint Memorandum Circular No. 

2014-1 dated July 2, 2014 which resulted to failure to review and evaluate the 

financial reports as against the Budget for the CY 2020. 

   

1.1 Section 7.1.1 (a) of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 
provides that “the Head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all 

government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: a) 

the required financial and other reports and statement are submitted by the 

concerned agency officials in such form and within the period prescribed by the 

commission, xxx.” 

 

1.2 Sections 31 and 32, Chapter 3, Volume I of the GAM and COA-DBM Joint 
Memorandum Circular No. 2014-1 dated July 2, 2014 set the timeliness and

1.3 The Audit Team noted that for the year 2020, the Accountant and Budget 
Officer failed to submit the annual budget and the Financial Accountability 

Reports (BFARs) as required under the above cited provisions which preclude 

the auditor to assess the agency performance versus plans and targets, to 

monitor and review the Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, 

Disbursements, and Balances, Quarterly Report of Revenue and other Receipts, 

Allotment and Sub-Allotments and to evaluate the agency’s transactions 

compliance with their approved budget. 

 

1.4 The non-compliance in the submission of BFARs casted doubt as to the legality 
and appropriateness in the agency’s financial transaction which shall be the 

ground for administrative disciplinary action and will cause the suspension of 

salaries of the Budget Officer and the Accountant. 

 

1.5 We recommended the Agency Head to require the Accountant and the 
Budget Officer to prepare and submit a BFARs as prescribed in Chapter 

3, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) and COA-

DBM Joint Circular No. 2014-1 dated July 2, 2014 to the Auditor or his 

representative. 

 



28 

  

2. The accuracy, correctness and reliability of the Property, Plant and Equipment 
(PPE) account amounting to ₱182,524,995.39 as at December 31, 2020 was 

doubtful due to the failure of Management to conduct yearly physical inventory 

of PPE and non-preparation and submission of physical inventory reports, 

contrary to Section 38, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for National 

Government Agencies (NGAs). 

 

2.1 Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs states that “the entity shall have 
a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be due annually and presented on 

the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) 

(Annex 71) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the 

auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment 

found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be 

reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording.” 

 

2.2  During our audit, it was revealed that the agency failed to conduct a physical 
inventory of all PPE as of December 31, 2020, which resulted to non-

submission of RPCPPE to the Audit Team. 

 

2.3  Further, the Accounting and Supply/Property Office did not maintain Supplies 
Ledger Card and Property Card, respectively, therefore reconciliation could not 

be done to come up with the correct balance of PPE. 

 

2.4  With the above audit observations, the accuracy, reliability and existence of the 
PPE accounts as presented in the financial statements as of December 31, 2020, 

could not be ascertained. 

 

2.5 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a) To conduct physical inventory of all its Property, Plant and Equipment 
every end of the year, in accordance with Section 38, Chapter 10, 

Volume I of the GAM for NGAs; 

 

b) Based on the actual inventory, the Physical Inventory Committee 
should prepare and submit RPCPPE to the Audit Team on time, using 

the prescribed format; and 

 

c) Instruct the Accounting and Property/Supply Office to 
maintain/update the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Cards 

(PPELC) and Supply/Property Cards, respectively and always 

reconcile their records. 

 

 

 

 



29 

  

3. The accuracy, correctness and reasonableness of charges made to Fuel, Oil and 
Lubricants Expenses account for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounting 

to ₱210,000.00 could not be ascertained due to the failure of the Management to 

submit a Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption, contrary to COA Circular No. 

77-66.  

 

3.1 COA Circular No. 77-66 provides the rules and regulations governing the use 
of government motor transportation and the fuel consumption thereof-

prescribing the use of the manual which specifically provides that: 

 

Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption of government motor 

transportation shall be submitted to the Auditor for verification 

purposes to determine the reasonableness of fuel consumed during the 

period. 

 

The report shall show among other, the different types of motor 

vehicles utilized by the agency during the month, total distance 

traveled, total fuel used and the normal fuel consumption for each 

vehicle. 

 

3.2   For the CY 2020 the reported amount utilized for Fuel, Oil, and Lubricants 

totaling ₱210,000.00 which was increased to 200% as compared to CY 2019 

which was amounted to ₱69,080.00. Upon verification on the supporting 

documents, it shows that no Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption was prepared 

nor submitted as basis for the actual fuel utilization.   

 

3.2 Further, audit revealed that Management failed to prepare and attach a Driver’s 
Trip Ticket for every fuel consumption to determine the number of fuel 

consumption for a particular period of time and for official purposes. The 

gasoline expenses was paid out of a cash advance by the disbursing officer 

instead of directly payment to the owner of the gasoline station. Hence, the 

Auditor could not assess whether the fuel consumption is utilized or regulated 

properly in connection with the operation of the agency. 

 

3.3 We recommended the Agency Head to require the person responsible to 
submit Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption to the Auditor to determine 

the reasonableness of fuel consumption during the period. Likewise, 

require the attachment of driver’s trip ticket to determine whether or not 

the fuel consumption is in connection with official trip.  

 

 

 

 

 

 



30 

  

4. The Agency failed to submit or furnish copy of the Purchase Order (PO) to the 
Auditor’s Office within five (5) working days upon approval/perfection in 

violation of the provision of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 

2009. This precluded the Auditor to conduct timely review of contracts, 

inspection of project and purchases, and communicate to Management 

defects/deficiencies noted. 

 

4.1  COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 provides the following: 

 

     3.2     Purchase Orders 

 

3.2.1 A copy of purchase order irrespective of amount, and each 

and every supporting document, shall, within five (5) 

working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the 

Auditor concerned. 

 

4.2   Further, Item 4.0 of the Circular provides the penalty clause for the failure to 

comply as follows: 

 

4.1 Any unjustified failure of the officials and employees concerned to 

comply with the requirements herein imposed shall be subject to 

the administrative disciplinary action provided in (a) Section 127 

of Presidential Decree No. 1445; (b) Section 55, Title I-B, Book V 

of the Revised Administrative Code of 1987; and (c) Section 11 of 

Republic Act No. 6713. 

 

4.3   It has been observed that the agency’s submission of Purchase Order and its 

supporting documents within the prescribed period had not been complied with, 

thus, evaluation on the reasonableness of costs and compliance to applicable 

rules and regulations were not immediately conducted. 

 

4.4    The delayed submission of the purchase order precluded the Audit Team prior 

review of these procurement transactions in its entirety as intended by the 

regulations, and further hindered the conduct of the review of propriety and 

compliance of the transactions to provisions of R.A. No. 9184 until the 

disbursement vouchers covering these transactions are finally submitted for 

post-audit several months later. 

 

4.5  We recommended that Management furnish the Auditor a copy of the 

Purchase Order upon approval by the requesting officials and the Agency 

Head within five (5) working days after the approval together with 

accomplished supporting documents for technical review and evaluation in 

compliance with COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009. 

 

 



31 

  

5. Management failed to notify the Audit Team of the time and date of every 
scheduled delivery of procurements on various supplies and materials in the 

total amount of ₱5,894,244.30 in contrary to Section 44 of P.D. 1445 and Section 

6.6 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995. 

 

5.1   Section 44 of Presidential Decree 1445 mandates the check and audit of 

property or supplies through ocular verification of the existence and condition  

of the property or supplies, not only through examination of pertinent 

documents. 

 

5.2   Moreover, COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 specifically provides 

that the management official responsible for accepting deliveries of procured 

items shall, within twenty four (24) hours from such acceptance, notify the 

Auditor of the time and date of the scheduled deliveries.  

 

5.3   It has been observed that series of procurements on various supplies and 

materials were done without management notice to COA to conduct the ocular 

inspection for the deliveries of materials and supplies.  For the year 2020, the 

total amount of ₱5,894,244.30 utilized for supplies and materials and the 

validity of the amount being utilized could not be ascertained due to failure of 

the management to notify within twenty-four (24) hours upon delivery of the 

said materials and supplies. 

 

5.4   The failure of the Management to comply with the COA Circular No. 95-006 

will lead to possible fraud and collusion, casting doubts as to the veracity of the 

existence, quantity and quality of the procurement as well as their conformance 

with the specifications.  This deficiency has been the highlight during post audit 

of paid vouchers and supporting documents, but then management could no 

longer comply the notice of inspection to COA since accordingly the supplies 

and materials already delivered and used for its purpose. 

 

5.5    However, management assured the Audit Team during exit conference that they 

will comply to COA Circular No. 95-006 by notifying the auditor within twenty 

(24) hours to conduct ocular inspection. 

 

5.6   We recommended that Management shall notify the Auditor on the time 

and date of the delivery of goods and services to check the actual physical 

existence of the procured supplies and materials. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



32 

  

6. The non-submission of a monthly Report of Accountability for Accountable 
Forms (RAAF) and monthly Consolidated Report of Accountability for 

Accountable Forms (CRAAF) in contrary to the provision of Sections 98, 

GAAM, Volume I, thereby exposing the accountable forms into possible loss or 

misuse. 

 

6.1   Section 98 of the GAAM, Volume I mandates the rendition of a monthly 

CRAAF of each accountable officer having custody of accountable forms for 

submission to the Auditor concerned for verification not later than the fifth day 

of the ensuing month. 

 

6.2  The financial transaction of the agency needs more accountable forms to be 

used every month and the failure of the management to submit a monthly report 

of accountability for accountable form could hardly assess the number of 

accountable forms used with serial numbers for a particular month. The Report 

of Check Issued (RCI) submitted shows that there are accountable forms not 

indicated in the RCI or no notification that it was a cancelled check.  Details are 

as follows:

6.3  We recommended the Management to require the person responsible to 

prepare and submit a monthly RAAF by each accountable officer having 

possession of the accountable forms for consolidation into a monthly 

CRAAF by the Cashier or Head of the Finance Unit.

B.  Others 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) Plan and Program 

 

7. The agency failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of allocating at 
least five percent (5%) of the total appropriations for Gender and Development 

(GAD) programs, projects and activities contrary to Commission on Audit 

(COA) Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 and Section 31 of the 

General Provisions on RA No. 11465 (GAA for FY 2020). 

 

7.1. Section 31 of Republic Act No. 11465, otherwise known as the General 
Appropriations Act (GAA) of FY 2020, requires all agencies of the government 

to formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address 

gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement 

applicable provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, 

Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination Against Women, 

the Beijing Platform for Action, the Millennium Development Goals, the 

Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025), and the 

Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022). 

 

7.2.  It also provides that the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of 
the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of the agency’s total 

budget appropriations. For this purpose, activities currently undertaken by the 

agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, 

economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, 

promotion and fulfillment of women’s human rights and practice of gender 

responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with such 

requirement. It was also provided that the utilization of the GAD budget shall 

be evaluated based on the GAD Performance Indicators identified by the 

agencies. 

 

7.3.  The preparations and submission of the annual GAD Plan and annual GAD 
Accomplishment Report shall be subject to the guidelines issued by the 

agencies concerned. 

 

7.4.  Moreover, Par. V of COA Circular 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 provides 
that the Audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and 

Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit Team assigned to the agency within five (5) 

working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the PCW or their 

mother or central offices as the case maybe. Likewise, a copy of the 

corresponding Accomplishment Report shall be furnished the said Audit Team 

within five (5) working days from the end of the preceding year. 

 

7.5. This observation was already brought out to the attention of Management in the 
prior year’s audit report but the Management still failed to comply, thus 

reiterated in this report. 



34 

  

 

7.6. We recommended the Management to: 
 

a) allocate at least five percent (5%) of the total annual budget for the 
implementation of GAD – related activities as required in the above 

cited provisions; and 

 

b) comply with the mandatory budget for GAD and lay down activities 
geared towards the attainment of GADs objectives, such as activities 

that contribute to poverty alleviation, women empowerment, and 

protection and promotion of women’ human rights. 

 

 

8. Status of Settlement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges. 

 

As of December 31, 2020, the Adiong Memorial Polytechnic State College had a
