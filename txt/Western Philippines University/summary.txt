EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



Introduction



The Western Philippines University (WPU) was created by virtue of Republic Act (RA) No. 9260 on March 5, 2004.  Its main service area is in the Province of Palawan. The main campus of the University is located in a sprawling 369 hectares of pristine land at Barangay San Juan, Aborlan, Palawan. It has seven other campuses in Palawan which operate in partnership with the local government units.



Financial Highlights



For Calendar Year (CY) 2020, the WPU generated a total income of P377,573,431 or a 13% decrease from last year’s income of P432,944,960 which is largely attributed to the decrease in the Subsidy from the National Government. The Subsidy from National Government (net of unused NCA) of P249,331,797 represents 66% of the University’s total income for the year.  Other major sources of income were school fees, sales revenue and other business income.



Under Fund 101, the total allotments available during the year was P252,084,574 and the obligations incurred by the University for the year amounted to P251,674,930. These registered a decrease of ₱7,971,258 and P8,394,694 from last year’s total allotments and obligations of P244,113,316 and P243,280,236, respectively.

Scope of Audit



The Audit Team conducted Financial, Compliance and Value for Money Audits on the accounts and operations of WPU for CY 2020. It included analysis of accounts in the financial statements, review of transactions and test of compliance with financial rules and regulations and assessment on the program’s effectiveness, efficiency and economy. The objectives of the audit are to ascertain the fairness and reliability of the University’s financial position and financial performance, to determine whether its operations were conducted in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and to assess/measure the level of effectiveness, efficiency and economy of the quality of education offered by the University.



Audit Opinion on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements of the University due to the following: 



a)	The accuracy, reliability and validity of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts with carrying value of P610,915,071.20 as of year-end were doubtful due to non-submission of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) and non-maintenance of updated Property Ledger Cards and Property Cards, inconsistent with Section 48, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies  (NGAs), Volume I, thus rendered the balances of the reported PPE accounts in the Financial Statement as of December 31, 2020 unreliable.



b)	Deficiencies in the handling, monitoring and accounting of inventories rendered the reliability, accuracy and existence of Inventory accounts with aggregate value of P11,337,246.74 as of December 31, 2020 doubtful due to the absence of the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) and the non-preparation and non-maintenance of Supplies Ledger Cards (SLC) and Stock Cards (SC) by the Accounting and Property and Supply Offices, respectively, contrary to Section 122 (l) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 and Sections 9 and 17 of Chapter 8, Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) Volume I.



c)	The reliability and accuracy of the year-end balances of Accounts Receivable amounting to P91,218,007.00 could not be ascertained due to a discrepancy of P6,618,185.00 between the General and Subsidiary ledgers contrary to Appendices 5 and 6 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume II, thus affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements. Moreover, the inefficiency of management to collect accounts receivable totaling P24,812,872.00 that remained outstanding from one to over five years deprived the University of the funds that could be used in carrying out its trifocal function of instruction, research and extension, and production, as well as defray its administrative costs pursuant to CMO No. 20 series of 2011.   





Significant Observations and Recommendations



For the exceptions cited above, we recommended the following:



a)	The Management to (i) direct both the Accountant and the Property and Supply Officer to maintain the prescribed accounting and property records for each type of property and equipment and ensure that these are properly reconciled and updated  so that discrepancies could be investigated promptly and adjustments, if necessary, effected accordingly; (ii) consider the hiring of additional staff to assist the Accountant and the Property and Supply Officer in the maintenance of the prescribed property records; and  (iii)  direct the Inventory Committee to conduct complete annual physical count of properties and prepare and submit the corresponding Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) for CY 2020 and every year thereafter within the prescribed period.



b)	The Management to (i) require the Inventory Committee to conduct physical count of all inventories, prepare the corresponding Report on the Physical Count of Inventories, and submit the same to the Accounting Office and to the Office of the Auditor not later than July 31 and January 31 of each year for the first and second semesters, respectively, pursuant to Section 122 (l) of P.D. No. 1445 and the GAM; (ii) direct the Accounting and Property and Supply Offices to strictly comply with the procedures in the receipt, issuance and recording of inventories provided in Section 8, Volume I of the GAM, including the proper maintenance of the SLC and updating of the SC for each type of supplies, prompt preparation and transmittal of the RSMI for the issued inventories and conduct of periodic reconciliation of accounting and supply inventory records; and (iii) require the Property and Supply Officer to regularly prepare and submit to Accounting Office the RSMIs for issued inventories based on actual consumption using the duly accomplished RIS of end users daily or as they take place.



c)	The Accounting Office to (i) exert efforts to verify and reconcile the discrepancy of P6,618,185.00 between the SL and the GL for a reliable and accurate account balance and, henceforth, regularly maintain updated subsidiary ledgers to avoid and detect errors/discrepancies in recording; (ii) intensify collection efforts in order to raise more funds that could be used by the University for its operations and improvement of facilities; and (iii) strengthen monitoring system to avoid accumulation of uncollected receivables, which may eventually become dormant due to non-settlement for a long period of time.



In addition, the following are the other significant observations and the corresponding recommended courses of action:



1)	The balances of reciprocal accounts, Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds are unreliable due to discrepancy/variance of P130,985.34 contrary to the Revised Chart of Accounts prescribed under the Government Accounting Manual for National Government agencies, Volume III.



The University Accountant exert extra efforts to reconcile the reciprocal accounts, Due to Other Funds and Due from Other Funds, for all funds, by tracing the discrepancies and effecting immediate adjustment/elimination in the books of accounts.  Thereafter, close monitoring and periodic reconciliation of the accounts be made to ensure the accuracy of the account balances in the ensuing financial statements. 



2)	Procured goods totaling P9,275,901.66 were not covered by warranty securities, contrary to Section 62.1, Rule XIX  and  Item M, Annex “H” of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184, thus the University was not assured that manufacturing defects, if any, shall be corrected by the concerned supplier. 



We recommended that Management henceforth, require warranty securities in the procurement of goods pursuant to Section 62.1, Rule XIX and Annex “H” of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184.  For consistent application, the University should adopt an internal policy on the requirement of the warranty securities on specific goods to be procured under SVP and emergency modes of procurement. 



3)	Completed infrastructure projects totaling P138,586,073.00 were not covered by warranty securities for Structural Defects and Failures as stipulated in the conditions of the contract contrary to Section 62.2.3 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184, thus responsibilities of the contractors are not guaranteed, in case of  improper construction, use of inferior quality/substandard materials, and any violation of the contract plans and specifications during the applicable warranty periods.



We recommended that the Management (i) impose the applicable warranty security against Structural Defects and Failures from the contractors after final acceptance of the infrastructure projects in accordance with Section 62.2.3.3 of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 and return only after the lapse of the applicable warranty period; and (ii)  ensure that the University Inspectorate Team shall conduct actual inspection of the projects before issuing the Certificate of Final Acceptance and require the contractors to undertake the necessary repair works at their own expense, in case of any deficiency/damage that may be found.



4)	Disbursements amounting to ₱551,372.89 were paid thru reimbursement basis instead of direct payment to suppliers, contrary to Section 93 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Republic Act No. 9184 thus, deprived the government of collecting taxes that could have been withheld from the payments thereof.  In addition, honoraria and wages of laborers hired for several projects undertaken in the field totaling P119,667.70 were paid thru reimbursement also instead of drawing cash advances for the purpose contrary to Sections 3 and 4 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997.  



We recommended that the Management (i) stop the practice of procuring goods and services through reimbursement basis and strictly adhere to Section 93 of PD No. 1445; and (ii) set-up and maintain a Petty Cash Fund duly supported by an estimate of expenses which shall be strictly used for petty operating expenses or draw cash advances for the purpose, whichever may be applicable, in accordance with COA Circular No. 97-002.



5)	The University failed to submit a copy of the CY 2020 Approved GAD Plan and Budget and its corresponding Actual Accomplishment Report to the COA Team contrary to COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014. 



We recommended that Management submit the duly Approved GAD Plan and Budget and Accomplishment Report for CY 2020 as well as the explanation or reason/s on non-submission thereof.  Henceforth, submit the required reports to COA within the stated period pursuant to Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 to facilitate timely evaluation of the implementation of GAD related programs/projects and substantive audit of the GAD related transactions.



The above audit findings and recommendations were discussed with concerned officials and staff in an exit conference conducted on April 13, 2021.  Management’s views and comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate.
