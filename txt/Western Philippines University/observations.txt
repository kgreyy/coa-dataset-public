PART II – DETAILED OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)	FINANCIAL AND COMPLIANCE AUDIT



1)	The accuracy, reliability and validity of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts with carrying value of P610,915,071.20 as of year-end were doubtful due to non-submission of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) and non-maintenance of updated Property Ledger Cards and Property Cards, inconsistent with Section 48, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies  (NGAs), Volume I, thus rendered the balances of the reported PPE accounts in the Financial Statement as of December 31, 2020 unreliable.

Chapter 10 covers accounting for Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) which includes accounting treatment, recognition, measurement and derecognition to ensure that all PPEs are properly valued and recorded, and the disclosure requirements in reporting PPE. 



International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) requires that Financial Statements present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires faithful representation of the effects of the transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs.



The Audit Team tested the accuracy and reliability of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts with carrying amount of P610,915,071.20 as of December 31, 2020 comprising 60 percent of the total assets as of year-end. Result of audit revealed the following deficiencies:

a)	The Inventory Committee failed to conduct a complete inventory taking for all the properties of the University, resulting in non-submission of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) for CY 2020 to the Office of the Auditor contrary to Section 38, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, prescribing that a physical inventory-taking being an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship has to be regularly enforced and a report thereon to be submitted to the Auditor not later than January 31 of the following year. 



Inquiry with the Inventory Committee Chairman disclosed that their failure to conduct complete inventory taking of all properties was due to conflicting schedules of the committee members and travel restrictions relative to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The importance of conducting the physical count of the agency’s property cannot be overemphasized because it will not only prove the correctness of the recorded balances of the PPE accounts in the Financial Statements (FS) but will also confirm the existence, location and condition of all properties listed in the accounting records and disclose the existence of any unrecorded property. 



b)	The Accountant and the Property and Supply Officer failed to update the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) and the Property Cards (PC) as required under Section 42, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.  The PPELCs will show the breakdown of the recorded PPE in the books of accounts. 



Section 42, Chapter 10, of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that “The Chief Accountant shall maintain the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock, etc.  The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset.  For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain Property Card (PC) for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same.  The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit.  They shall also be reconciled with other property records like Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR).”



Inquiry with the Accounting and Property and Supply Officers disclosed that the non-maintenance of accounting and property records was due to lack of manpower and voluminous work in both offices. 



In the absence of RPCPPE and non-maintenance of updated PPELC and PC,  the accuracy, existence and condition of the reported PPE accounts cannot be established, thus rendered the balances of PPE accounts in the Financial Statement as of December 31, 2020 unreliable.



The above deficiencies were also noted in prior years, however, Management did not yet comply with the Audit Team’s recommendations.  



We reiterated our recommendations that Management:



a)	direct the Inventory Committee to conduct complete annual physical count of properties and prepare and submit the corresponding Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) for CY 2020 and every year thereafter within the prescribed period;



b)	direct both the Accountant and the Property and Supply Officer to maintain the prescribed accounting and property records for each type of property and equipment and ensure that these are properly reconciled and updated  so that discrepancies could be investigated promptly and adjustments, if necessary, effected accordingly; and



c)	consider the hiring of additional staff to assist the Accountant and the Property and Supply Officer in the maintenance of the prescribed property records.



The Management was amenable with the observations and agreed to comply with the audit recommendations. 



2)	Deficiencies in the handling, monitoring and accounting of inventories rendered the reliability, accuracy and existence of Inventory accounts with aggregate value of P11,337,246.74 as of December 31, 2020 doubtful due to the absence of the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) and the non-preparation and non-maintenance of Supplies Ledger Cards (SLC) and Stock Cards (SC) by the Accounting and Property and Supply Offices, respectively, contrary to Section 122 (l) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 and Sections 9 and 17 of Chapter 8, Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) Volume I.



Section 122 (l) of P.D. No. 1445 states that whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulation issued by it require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officer, cashiers, disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions.



Various reports/ records for inventories are required under Sections 9 and 17, Chapter 8, Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) Volume I, as quoted:



Sec. 9. Perpetual Inventory Method.  Supplies and materials purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running total for the cost of goods sold in each period.  The system requires accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the maintenance of the SLC (Appendix 57) by the Accounting Division/Unit and Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) by the Supply and /or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock.  Regular purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for supplies and materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense account.



Section 17 provides the following Records, Forms and Reports to be prepared and/or maintained, among others: 



(b) Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) – shall be used to record all receipts and issues of supplies and the balance in quantity at any time.  It shall be maintained by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit for each item in stock.  The IAR, RIS, PO and DR serve as the original sources of information for making entries in the card.



(c)Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) (Appendix 57) – shall be used to record materials received, issued and the balance both in quantity and amount at any time.  It shall be maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit for each kind of supplies and materials.  The IAR, RIS, RSMI, PO and DR serve as the original sources of information for making entries on the card. 



(d) Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) (Appendix 63) - shall be used by the end-user to request issue of supplies and materials that are carried on stock.  It is also used by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit to indicate availability or non-availability of items requisitioned and/or issues of item/s requisitioned. 



(g) Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) (Appendix 64) – shall be prepared by the Property and/or Supply Custodian based on the RIS and shall be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the JEV to record the supplies and materials issued.



i)	Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) (Appendix 66) - shall be used to report the physical count of supplies by type of inventory as at a given date.  It shows the balance of inventory items per card and per count and shortage/overage, if any.  These include the semi-expendable property wherein the issue is covered by ICS. 



The University’s Statement of Financial Position (SFP) as of December 31, 2020 presented the Inventory account balance of P11,337,246.74, composed of the following:

Pursuant to the above cited regulations, the agency shall conduct physical count of inventories every semester.  The report shall be reconciled with the SLCs and SCs maintained by the Accounting and Property and Supply Offices, respectively.  Any discrepancy shall be verified and/or adjusted accordingly.  The semi-expendable properties wherein the issuances are covered by Inventory Custodian Slips (ICS) shall be included in the RPCI. 



Verification showed that the Property and Supply Office failed to conduct the physical count/inventory of supplies, including the semi-expendable properties covered by the ICS, thus, the semi-annual Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) was not prepared contrary to Section 122 (l) of PD No. 1445 and Section 17 (i), Chapter 8, GAM for NGAs, Volume 1.



Also, the Accountant and the Property and Supply Officer failed to prepare/update the individual Supplies Ledger Cards and Stock Cards, respectively, to reconcile their records.



Further review of the records prepared and maintained in the various campuses showed that SCs in Aborlan and Puerto Princesa Campuses were not complete, updated and consolidated.  Inquiry with the concerned agency personnel disclosed that they started to record/update the Stock Cards during the year however, due to other assigned tasks and voluminous work they could not regularly update the individual stock cards. Validation of SC in Puerto Princesa campus also showed that the latest entry was for the month of September 2020.  



The Audit Team also noted that the RSMIs were prepared and forwarded separately by the Property and Supply Units/Offices in the Puerto Princesa and Aborlan campuses on a monthly basis to the Accounting Office, instead of a consolidated report daily or as they take place.  As of audit, the RSMI for the month of December was only transmitted to Accounting Office in February 2021.



Interview with the Property and Supply Office personnel disclosed that they were not able to conduct physical count of inventories in the previous years due to lack of personnel. 



Accounting personnel also revealed that due to the volume of transactions, a general classification of the inventory items was maintained instead of individual ledger cards for each kind of supplies and materials.  It was further disclosed that in their preparation of the JEV, debits or additions to the general inventory accounts were recorded upon receipt by the Accounting Office of the disbursement vouchers with complete supporting documents such as Purchase Orders (PO) and Inspection and Acceptance Reports (IAR) while credits or deductions from the accounts were made upon receipt of the RSMI supported by the RIS from the Property and Supply Office. 



The RSMI should have been the basis of the Accounting Office in recording issued inventory items as deductions from inventory accounts with corresponding debit to appropriate accounts.  



The absence of the RPCI and the failure of the Property and Supply and Accounting Offices to prepare and maintain SC and SLC prevented the Audit Team to validate the accuracy of the reported balances of the Inventory account. Thus, its fair presentation in the financial statements could not be ascertained.







We recommended that Management:



a)	require the Inventory Committee to conduct physical count of all inventories, prepare the corresponding Report on the Physical Count of Inventories, and submit the same to the Accounting Office and to the Office of the Auditor not later than July 31 and January 31 of each year for the first and second semesters, respectively, pursuant to Section 122 (l) of P.D. No. 1445 and the GAM;



b)	direct the Accounting and Property and Supply Offices to strictly comply with the procedures in the receipt, issuance and recording of inventories provided in Section 8, Volume I of the GAM, including the proper maintenance of the SLC and updating of the SC for each type of supplies, prompt preparation and transmittal of the RSMI for the issued inventories and conduct of periodic reconciliation of accounting and supply inventory records; and



c)	require the Property and Supply Officer to regularly prepare and submit to Accounting Office the RSMIs for issued inventories based on actual consumption using the duly accomplished RIS of end users daily or as they take place.



The Management was amenable with the observations and agreed to comply with the audit recommendations. 



3)	The reliability and accuracy of the year-end balances of Accounts Receivable amounting to P91,218,007.00 could not be ascertained due to a discrepancy of P6,618,185.00 between the General and Subsidiary ledgers contrary to Appendices 5 and 6 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume II, thus affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements. Moreover, the inefficiency of management to collect accounts receivable totalling P24,812,872.00 that remained outstanding from one to over five years deprived the University of the funds that could be used in carrying out its trifocal function of instruction, research and extension, and production, as well as defray its administrative costs pursuant to CMO No. 20 series of 2011.   



IPSAS define qualitative characteristics as the attributes that make information provided in the FS useful to users. One of the four qualitative characteristics is reliability which states that for information to be reliable, it must be free from material error or bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.



As of December 31, 2020, the University reported Accounts Receivable in its Statement of Financial Position (SFP) a gross amount of P91,218,007.00, Allowance for Impairment of P454,243.15 and a Net Realizable Value of P90,763,763.85. This account represents the unpaid amount of tuition and other fiduciary fees in the current and previous years due from several paying or non-scholar students enrolled in different campuses, from various scholarship sponsors and from CHED for the implementation of Free Higher Education.



To test the accuracy and reliability of the Accounts Receivable account, the Audit Team reviewed relevant documents and reports which showed a discrepancy of P6,618,185.00 between the SL and GL balances of P88,599,822.00 and P91,218,007.00, respectively.  Thus, the reliability and accuracy of the balance of Accounts Receivable as of December 31, 2020 could be not be ascertained. Inquiry with accounting personnel disclosed that said difference has already been noted and is subject of reconciliation and verification. 



Also, review of the Aging of Accounts Receivables disclosed that  four percent pertains to unpaid accounts of various scholarship grants such as Iskolar ng Bayan in coordination with the Congressional Districts and Programang Pang-Edukasyon Para sa Palaweno (PPEPP) amounting to P3,201,440.00, 24 percent represents the unpaid accounts of non-scholars/paying students amounting to P21,701,492.00 and the remaining 72 percent or P63,696,890.00 represents the amount due from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) in relation to the implementation of Free Higher Education for SY 2020-2021.  The uncollectible accounts aged one year to over five years amounted to P24,812,872.00 which is 28 percent of the total accounts receivable.

Records also showed that despite the materiality of unpaid accounts, billing statements and collections letters were only sent to the students by batch.  It was further noted that some of the collection letters sent were returned to the University due to incomplete address or unknown addressee. The latest batch of collection letters sent to paying students were in CY 2019, while the latest billing or statement of account sent to scholarship grantors were in CY 2018. During the year, only a total of P323,940.00 or less than 2 percent of receivables from non-scholars/paying students and none from various scholarship sponsors was collected.  



The low or inefficient collection of unpaid school fees limits the funds of the University to finance its activities for instruction, research, extension or other program/projects as provided under Article 1 (v) of CMO No. 20 series of 2011.



We recommended that the University President instruct the Accounting Office to:



a)	exert efforts to verify and reconcile the discrepancy of P6,618,185.00 between the SL and the GL for a reliable and accurate account balance and, henceforth, regularly maintain updated subsidiary ledgers to avoid and detect errors/discrepancies in recording;



b)	intensify collection efforts in order to raise more funds that could be used by the University for its operations and improvement of facilities; and



c)	strengthen monitoring system to avoid accumulation of uncollected receivables, which may eventually become dormant due to non-settlement for a long period of time.



The Management was amenable with the observations and agreed to comply with the audit recommendations. They further informed this Office that the CHED payment of P59,022,040 pertaining to the 1st semester AY 2020-2021 billing for tuition and other school fees  covered by RA No. 10931 or the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act of 2017) was already recorded in the books in January 2021 

4)	The balances of reciprocal accounts, Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds are unreliable due to discrepancy/variance of P130,985.34 contrary to the Revised Chart of Accounts prescribed under the Government Accounting Manual for National Government agencies, Volume III.



The Revised Chart of Accounts prescribed under the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume III, describes Due from Other Funds as an account used to recognize transfers to other funds and/or receivables from other funds of the agency while Due to Other Funds as account used to recognize transfers from other funds and/or payables to other funds. These are classified as inter-agency  reciprocal accounts, which require a debit entry to one fund and the corresponding credit entry to another when a fund is transferred from one fund to another recognizing a receivable in the source fund while creating a payable in the recipient fund.  As such, these accounts should always have equal balances as a result of the elimination/offsetting process.



Review of the Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020 showed that the balance of said reciprocal accounts has a discrepancy of P130,985.34, broken down as follows:

Based on the submitted subsidiary ledgers for both accounts, the following were observed by the Audit Team:



a)	A total of P205,532.99 was debited under the Due from Other Funds - Fund 184 to set up the receivable for liquidated damages, however, no corresponding entry was made under Fund 101;  

b)	A beginning balance of P200.00 as of January 1, 2020 under Due from Other Funds - Fund 184 remain unadjusted at year-end;

c)	A total of P35,272.79 was credited to Due to Other Funds – Fund 101 for payment of various supplies, however, no corresponding entries to Due from Other Funds were  recorded in all other funds;

d)	A total of P32,970.66 was credited to Due to Other Funds – Fund 164 for payment of various supplies, however, no corresponding entries to Due from Other Funds were  recorded in all other funds; and

e)	A total of P6,504.30 was credited to Due to Other Funds – Fund 184 which pertains to the deposits made by the University Cashier and payment of various supplies, however, no corresponding entries to Due from Other Funds were  recorded in all other funds.



The existence of such variance is a manifestation that transactions within these funds/sub-accounts were not properly taken up as they should have been recorded. If not properly monitored, errors will not be adjusted and may continue in the ensuing years, and could render the balances of both accounts unreliable affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements.  



We recommended that the University Accountant exert extra efforts to reconcile the reciprocal accounts, Due to Other Funds and Due from Other Funds, for all funds, by tracing the discrepancies and effecting immediate adjustment/elimination in the books of accounts.  Thereafter, close monitoring and periodic reconciliation of the accounts be made to ensure the accuracy of the account balances in the ensuing financial statements. 



The Management was amenable with the observations and informed this Office that adjustments to reconcile the reciprocal accounts were already effected in February 2021. 



5)	Procured goods totaling P9,275,901.66 were not covered by warranty securities, contrary to Section 62.1, Rule XIX  and  Item M, Annex “H” of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184, thus the University was not assured that manufacturing defects, if any, shall be corrected by the concerned supplier. 



Section 62.1, Rule XIX of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184 provides that, For the procurement of Goods, in order to assure that manufacturing defects shall be corrected by the supplier, a warranty security shall be required from the contract awarded for a minimum of three (3) months, in the case of Expendable Supplies, or a minimum period of one (1) year, in the case of Non-expendable Supplies, after acceptance by the Procuring Entity of the delivered supplies. 



The obligation for the warranty shall be covered by either retention money in an amount equivalent to at least one percent (1%) of every progress payment; or a special bank guarantee equivalent to at least one percent (1%) of the total contract price.  The said amounts shall only be released after the lapse of the warranty period or, in the case of Expendable Supplies, after consumption thereof:  Provided, however, That the supplies delivered are free from patent and latent defects and all the conditions imposed under the contract have been fully met.



Section 5 (m) and (w) of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184 defined Expendable and Non-Expendable Supplies as follows:



Section 5(m)  Expendable Supplies. Refer to articles which are normally consumed in use within one (1) year or converted in the process of manufacture or construction, or those having a life expectancy of more than one (1) year but which shall have decreased substantially in value after being put to use for only one (1) year (e.g., medicines, stationery, fuel and spare parts).



Section 5(w) Non-expendable Supplies.  Refer to articles which are not consumed in use and ordinarily retain their original identity during the period of use, whose serviceable life is more than one (1) year and which add to the assets of the GoP (e.g., furniture, fixtures, transport and other equipment).  For this IRR, the term non-expendable supplies should include semi-expendable property. 



Item M, Annex “H” of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184 also provides the following:



M.  Bid, Performance and Warranty Securities



Bid security may be dispensed with.  However, performance and/or warranty securities are required for the following alternative methods of procurement, in accordance with Sections 39 and 62 of the IRR as summarized below:

Post-audit of CY 2020 transactions showed that the University purchased various expendable and semi-expendable goods such as furniture and fixtures, office equipment, sporting goods, IT equipment and laboratory equipment totalling P9,275,901.66 through various modes of procurement, as summarized in the table below.

Verification of documents relative to the above transactions such as journals and journal entry vouchers (JEVs)  revealed that no guaranty deposits payable was taken up in the books  to record the issuance of warranty security by the suppliers of the procured goods. Interview with management disclosed that warranty securities were not required from said suppliers, contrary to the above provisions of the RIRR of RA No. 9184.  Further inquiry also revealed that the University has no written internal policy yet pertaining to requirements on warranty securities, particularly when the mode of procurement is through small value procurement (SVP) and emergency purchase.  It is provided in Item M, Annex H on the IRR of RA No. 9184 that under emergency cases and SVP, the Procuring Entity may require WS depending on the procurement project.  Hence, management should have a clear internal policy on the requirement of the warranty securities of specific goods/project to be procured thru SVP or emergency cases including the required forms of WS.



It was observed however, that instead of security warranties in required forms, warranty certificates were issued by some of their suppliers and attached to the disbursement vouchers.  The management informed this Office that warranty certificates/cards issued by suppliers served as their commitment to correct any manufacturing defects under certain terms and conditions and that the suppliers were able to replace delivered items that were later found defective.



We recommended that Management henceforth, require warranty securities in the procurement of goods pursuant to Section 62.1, Rule XIX and Annex “H” of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184.  For consistent application, the University should adopt an internal policy on the requirement of the warranty securities on specific goods to be procured under SVP and emergency modes of procurement. 



The Management was amenable with the observations and agreed to implement the audit recommendations. 



6)	Completed infrastructure projects totaling P138,586,073.00 were not covered by warranty securities for Structural Defects and Failures as stipulated in the conditions of the contract contrary to Section 62.2.3 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184, thus responsibilities of the contractors are not guaranteed, in case of  improper construction, use of inferior quality/substandard materials, and any violation of the contract plans and specifications during the applicable warranty periods.

Upon further review of the documents submitted, it was noted that after project completion, and within the one (1) year defects liability period (DLP), the contractors posted or substituted surety bonds for the release of the retention monies to guarantee the defects in workmanship and to make good of such defects to answer for any claim by the University within the period of one (1) year from the date of final completion of the projects. However, after the 1-year defects liability period, no further warranty securities were posted by the contractors on the abovementioned projects as required under Section 62.2.3.3 of the RIRR of RA No. 9184.



Upon inquiry with the concerned personnel, it was disclosed that after final inspection of the Inspectorate Team certifying for the 100% completion of the project, the University issued Certificates of Completion to contractors to support their claims for payment of final billing, informing them of, among others, (i) their obligations and responsibilities within the one (1) year Defects Liability Period; (ii) that the University shall issue the Final Acceptance for the projects after the lapse of the one year Defects Liability Period; and (iii) the required posting of the Warranty Security.  However, after the lapse of the DLP, the management failed to issue the Final Acceptance to contractors nor to require from them the posting of the warranty securities for all the completed projects in CY 2019. 



Had the University required from the contractors to post the warranty securities after final acceptance of the projects, any of the following should have been posted by the contractors in CY 2020:



Form of Warranty Security

Amount of Warranty Security (Equal to Percentage of the Total Contract Price of P138,586,073.09)

a)	Cash or Letter of Credit issued by a Universal or Commercial bank: Provided, however, that the LC shall be confirmed by a Universal or Commercial 

6,929,303.65

(5% of TCP)

b)	Bank guarantee confirmed by a Universal or Commercial Bank

13,858,607.30

(10% of TCP)

c)	Surety bond callable upon demand issued by GSIS or a surety or insurance company duly certified by the Insurance Commission as authorized to issue such security.

41,575,821.92

(30% of TCP)



Since the above mentioned warranties were not imposed, the performance of contractors for structural defects and failures which may arise due to faults attributable to improper construction, use of inferior quality/substandard materials, and any violation of the contract plans and specifications during the applicable warranty periods are not guaranteed.



We recommended and Management agreed:



a)	to impose the applicable warranty security against Structural Defects and Failures from the contractors after final acceptance of the infrastructure projects in accordance with Section 62.2.3.3 of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 and return only after the lapse of the applicable warranty period; and



b)	to ensure that the University Inspectorate Team shall conduct actual inspection of the projects before issuing the Certificate of Final Acceptance and require the contractors to undertake the necessary repair works at their own expense, in case of any deficiency/damage that may be found.



7)	Disbursements amounting to ₱551,372.89 were paid thru reimbursement basis instead of direct payment to suppliers, contrary to Section 93 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Republic Act No. 9184 thus, deprived the government of collecting taxes that could have been withheld from the payments thereof.  In addition, honoraria and wages of laborers hired for several projects undertaken in the field totaling P119,667.70 were paid thru reimbursement also instead of drawing cash advances for the purpose contrary to Sections 3 and 4 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997.  



Section 93 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 also known as State Audit Code of the Philippines states that:

	

To whom warrants or checks payable. Warrants chargeable to revenue or trust funds of the national government or checks drawn against the treasury Checking Account for Agencies maintained with any government depository shall be made payable either directly to the creditor to whom the money is due or to a disbursing officer for official disbursement



	Pertinent provisions of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 9184 provide as follows:



Section 10 All procurement shall be done through competitive bidding,  except as provided in Article XVI of this IRR.

	

Section 48.1 Subject to the approval of the Head of the Procuring Entity, and whenever justified by the conditions provided in this Act, the Procuring Entity may, resort to any of the alternative methods of procurement provided in this rule. In all instances, the Procuring Entity shall ensure that the most advantageous price for the Government is obtained.

	

Post-audit of transactions of the University for CY 2020 disclosed that several officials and employees paid a total amount of ₱671,040.59 as reimbursements of procured goods/services. Analysis as to the frequency of the reimbursements made showed that there were 60 personnel who made reimbursements of at least 1 to 18 times in CY 2020. 

	

Payment in cash to supplier is contrary to Item 2.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 which provides that “all payments must be made by checks. x xx  In practice, however, there are certain instances when it may be very difficult, impractical or impossible to make payments by check.  In such case, payments may be made by the disbursing officer in the form of cash through his cash advance”.  

	

It was also provided under Item Section 3 of the said COA Circular, among others,  that (i) regular cash advances may be granted for payment of honoraria and other similar payments to officials and employees or (ii) special cash advances for payment of current operation expenditures of the agency field office or of the activity of the agency undertaken in the field when it is impractical to pay the same by check, such as salaries, wages and allowances and maintenance and other operating expenses.

	

Moreover, reimbursements pertaining to procurements of goods and services paid in cash to the payees contravene RA No. 9184 which prescribes the use of competitive bidding and for exceptional cases, the alternative modes of procurement in the acquisition of goods and services to ensure that the most advantageous price for the Government is obtained.

		

The concerned officials/employees explained that procurement in cash were not avoided due to necessity and urgent needs, short duration provided by the grantor in project implementation and non-maintenance of petty cash fund that can be used to pay petty and emergency expenses.



Payments in cash to suppliers of goods and services by those who claimed reimbursements not only violate the provision of Section 93 of P.D. No. 1445 which requires direct payment to the creditor to whom the money is due or to a disbursing officer for official disbursement but also deprive the government of the possible income that can be derived from withholding of taxes from the suppliers of goods and services.

	

	

	

	

	

	We recommended that Management: 

	

a)	stop the practice of procuring goods and services through reimbursement basis and strictly adhere to Section 93 of PD No. 1445; and



b)	set-up and maintain a Petty Cash Fund duly supported by an estimate of expenses which shall be strictly used for petty operating expenses  or draw cash advances for the purpose, whichever may be applicable, in accordance with COA Circular No. 97-002.



The Management was amenable with the observations and agreed to comply with the audit recommendations.



B. GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT



8)	The University failed to submit a copy of the CY 2020 Approved GAD Plan and Budget and its corresponding Actual Accomplishment Report to the COA Team contrary to COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014. 



Section 31 of Republic Act No. 11465 provides that all agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under R.A.  No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025), and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).



      The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets.  For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion and fulfilment of women’s human rights and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement.  Utilization of GAD Budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies. 



The preparation and submission of annual GAD Plan and Budget and Accomplishment Report shall be guided by Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01 issued by DBM, NEDA and PCW. 



Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 states that:



Responsibility of the Audit Agency: The Audit Agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the COA Team assigned to the agency within five (5) working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the PCW or their mother or central offices a the case maybe.  Likewise, a copy of the corresponding report shall be furnished the Audit team within five (5) working days from the end of January of the preceding year.



  Records showed that the University failed to submit to the Audit Team a copy of its GPB, duly approved by PCW and the Accomplishment Report for CY 2020 as of this writing, in violation of COA Circular No. 2014-001.  



The non-submission of the GPB and the corresponding Accomplishment Report for CY 2020 precluded the Audit Team to review properly the disbursements under the GAD program. 



We recommended that Management submit the duly Approved GAD Plan and Budget and Accomplishment Report for CY 2020 as well as the explanation or reason/s on non-submission thereof.  Henceforth, submit the required reports to COA within the stated period pursuant to Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 to facilitate timely evaluation of the implementation of GAD related programs/projects and substantive audit of the GAD related transactions.



The management was amenable with the audit observations and agreed to comply with the audit recommendations. Also, they were able to submit to COA the University’s CY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) (revised as per NBC 580) and the Accomplishment Report (AR) last April 15, 2021. The newly-designated GAD Focal Person was already made aware of the requirements and they assured to exert extra efforts to henceforth submit these reports to COA as prescribed on a regular basis. 





C. 	COMPLIANCE WITH TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS



The University substantially complied with the provisions of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 23-2007 dated March 20, 2007 relative to the withholding of applicable taxes.
