PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

Accounting Errors/Omissions/Misstatements and Other Accounting Deficiencies 

 

1. Financial audit conducted on the accounts and operations of TESDA disclosed 
that the year-end consolidated financial statements (FS) of the Agency for 

Calendar Year (CY) 2020 were misstated by an aggregate absolute amount of 

₱371,257,713.14 due to unadjusted accounting errors and omissions in the 

Central Office (CO) and 15 Regional Offices (ROs). Moreover, six accounts 

under the Assets, Liabilities and Expenses categories with an aggregate 

balance of ₱2,576,281,789.20 are unreliable due to unaccounted discrepancies, 

accounting deficiencies and control lapses that affected the fair presentation 

of the year-end FS. 

 

1.1 Section 15, Chapter 2 of the GAM provides that the financial statements 
(FSs) shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and 

cash flows of an entity; and that fair presentation requires the faithful 

representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in 

accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 

revenue, and expenses set out in the International Public Sector Accounting 

Standards (IPSAS). 

 

1.2 Section 6, Chapter 19 of the GAM, Volume I, enumerated the qualitative 
characteristics of financial reporting. Among which, are reliability, faithful 

representation and completeness defined as follows: 

 

Reliability – reliable information is free from material error and bias, and can 

be depended on by the users to represent faithfully that which it purports to 

represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. 

 

Faithful representation – information to represent faithfully transactions and 

other events, it should be represented in accordance with the substance of the 

transactions and other events, and not merely their legal form. 

 

Completeness – the information in FSs should be complete within the bounds 

of materiality and cost. 

 

1.3 Audit of the CY 2020 financial transactions and operations of TESDA 
showed various accounting errors and omissions in an aggregate amount of 

₱371,257,713.14, which is more than the materiality threshold of 

₱91,745,006.39 as presented in Table 1 below:

RO/OUs Management’s Comments/Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

₱57,664.23 were already done under JEV No. 01-2021-06-0701. Documents to 

support the unrecorded bank debits and those unsupported entries in the books 

amounting to ₱1,604,093.06 were also forwarded to the Audit Team. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

The documents provided shall be subject to further validation and results shall 

be communicated to the Management. 

CAR- Kalinga PO,

The Managements committed to comply with the recommendations.  Moreover, 

Apayao PO   submitted to the Audit Team JEV No. 2021-02-031 on February 

28, 2021 to effect the suggested recommendation. 

II-RTC Management explained that the unadjusted net reconciling items under SSP 

Fund are yet to be reconciled because of the delay of the BS for the periods 

August to December, 2020. The Agency has already taken strides by securing 

snapshots of the BSs from its depository bank for August to December 2020. 

The designated staff will prepare the JEVs to recognize the net reconciling items 

of SSP Fund and Fund 101 amounting to ₱1,085,122.00 and ₱1,616,648.65 

respectively. 

II- NVPI The Accountant shall prepare the journal entries to recognize the stale check still 

included as outstanding check to ensure fair presentation and reliability of the 

Cash in Bank   account balance in the FS. The Accountant agreed to record the

VIII- RTC The FA already adjusted the books to reflect the necessary adjustments. 

VIII- NSPO The Bookkeeper committed that she will immediately adjust these 

misstatements upon preparation of the January 2021 financial reports. 

VIII- CNSAT 

 

The FA will coordinate with TESDA PO of Southern Leyte; and will 

immediately record the payment for assessment fee in the Agency’s books.   

Also, monthly BRS will be prepared and book reconciling items will be 

recorded. 

VIII- Samar PO The Accounting Division will be directed to prepare 

monthly BRS and make necessary adjustments through JEVs, to 

provide the accurate balances of Cash in Bank-Local Currency accounts, 

VIII- BCAT The Accountant-Designate explained that the BSs for 

December 2020 are not yet available, thus she was not able to prepare the needed 

BRS.  She could not establish the outstanding checks and other reconciling items 

because the snapshot given by the bank only shows the bank balance as of the  

period.   With regard to the unrecorded NCAs which were part of the book’s 

reconciling items of the submitted previous months’ BRS, she explained that 

they are not immediately informed on the NTAs downloaded from the Regional 

Office, thus she was just able to record the adjustment upon receipt of the BS. 

 

To address the issue, the Agency Head proposed to send a formal request to their 

bank to facilitate immediate and timely receipt of the BS. Furthermore, the 

Management committed to submit the lacking BRS within the month of March 

2021. 

IX- RO, PO ZDN 

and DSF 

Management of TESDA RO IX explained that BRS as of February 2021 for 

Regular Fund 101 and December 31, 2020 for Trust Liability account and SSP 

account were already submitted to the Audit Team and accordingly, they will 

try to apply for the “we Access” and “eMDS” e-banking products of Land Bank 

for convenient MDS transactions online and to enable them to access the 

monthly banking transactions online and avoid the manual request for BSs. 

 

Management of TESDA PO ZDN affirmed that the recommendation is noted 

and explained that as of July 9, 2020, they already submitted the BRS for the 

months of January and February 2020 for Fund 101, SSP Fund and UAQTEA 

Fund to the Audit Team and that they are still waiting for the BSs for the months 

of March to June 2020. Management, in its letter, stated that “rest assured that 

BRS for March to June 2020 will be submitted as soon as they will receive the 

bank statements from LBP. We hope that the above management response has 

sufficiently addressed the issues raised per COA AOM.”

emphasized to the Accounting Staff the importance of 

monitoring of payments to the TTIs and urged other school 

administrators to do the same. The balances noted will be 

collected by the PO if no claim has been made by the 

scholars to the TTIs.

a. Unreconciled differences between books and physical count balances - 
₱6,103,443.88 

 

7.1 Section 58 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 provides the audit of assets, "The 
examination and audit of assets shall be performed with a view to 

ascertaining their existence, ownership, valuation and encumbrances as well 

as the propriety of items composing the respective asset accounts, 

determining their agreement with records, proving the accuracy of such 

records; ascertaining if the assets were utilized economically, efficiently and 

effectively; and evaluating the adequacy of controls over the accounts.” 

 

7.2 Moreover, Item D of Appendices 57 and 58 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II 
provides that: 

 

“The agency shall conduct physical count of inventories every 

semester. The semestral physical inventory of supplies shall be 

reconciled with the SLCs and controlling accounts and Supply 

and/or Property records. Any discrepancies shall be immediately 

verified and adjusted.” 

 

7.3 Item C of Appendix 66 of the same Manual provides: 
 

“The report shall be reconciled with the SLCs and SCs maintained by the 

Accounting Division/Unit, and Property and/or Supply Division/Unit, 

respectively. Any discrepancy shall be verified and/or adjusted 

accordingly.” 

 

7.4 The book balances of Inventories accounts were not reconciled with the 
Report on Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) due to inability of the 

Accountant and Supply Officer to properly reconcile their records with noted 

difference of ₱6,103,443.88 at yearend, details per region are as follows:

CNSAT - During the Exit Conference, the Management stated 

that reconciliation on the remaining items with discrepancies is 

still ongoing. 

 

LNAS - The Bookkeeper and the Supply Officer agreed to follow 

the audit recommendation. 

 

BCAT -The Agency Head explained that since this observation 

was part of the previous year’s audit findings, the Management 

already hired additional Job Order personnel to assist in the 

reconciliation. Furthermore, both the Accounting and the Supply 

Units committed to reconcile their records and Inventory 

balances, including those issuances of supplies.  They assured 

that same finding will not be repeated in the current year. 

 

b. Unreconciled balance of undistributed toolkits per Accounting and Supply 
Unit records - ₱2,180,104.44 

 

7.7 Chapter 8, Section 17 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, discusses about the 
different prescribed records, forms and reports to be prepared and/or 

maintained by the Agency. 

 

a. Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) – shall be used to record all 
receipts and issues of supplies and the balance in quantity at any 

time. It shall be maintained by the Property and/or Supply 

Division/Unit for each item in stock. The IAR, RIS, PO and DR 

serve as the original sources of information for making entries on 

the card.  

 

b. Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) (Appendix 57) – shall be used to 
record materials received, issued and the balance both in quantity 

and amount at any time.  It shall be maintained by the Accounting 

Division/Unit for each kind of supplies and materials. The IAR, 

RIS, RSMI, PO and DR serve as the original sources of 

information for making entries on the card. 

 

c. Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) (Appendix 64) – 
shall be prepared by the Property and/or Supply Custodian based 

on the RIS and shall be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as 

basis in preparing the JEV to record the supplies and materials 

issued. 

 

d. Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) (Appendix 66) 
– shall be used to report the physical count of supplies by type of 

inventory as at a given date.  It shows the balance of inventory 

items per card and per count and shortage/overage, if any. These 

include the semi-expendable property wherein the issue is covered 

by ICS. 

 



59 

 

7.8 However, audit revealed non-utilization of the above prescribed forms and 
there were lapses in the inventory procedures that resulted in discrepancies 

in the General Ledger (GL) balances and records of the Supply Unit 

amounting to ₱2,180,104.44. 

 

7.9 We recommended, and the Management of PO Antique agreed, to 
require the Accountant and Supply Officer to reconcile the 

discrepancies noted on 174 undistributed toolkits and adjust the 

balances of their records accordingly. 

 

c. Inventories not revalued despite prolonged storage and non-distribution - 
₱1,872,511.98 

 

7.10 Chapter 8, Section 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states that: 
 

Sec. 8. Impairment. An asset is said to be impaired if the cost of inventories 

held for sale is higher than the net realizable value or the cost of inventories 

held for distribution or consumption is higher than the current replacement 

cost. The difference between the cost and net realizable value/current 

replacement cost shall be recognized as an expense in the financial statement. 

 

7.11 Audit of Other Supplies and Materials held for distribution revealed that 
there were various inventory items such as various toolkits for CYs 2016 and 

2017 for Special Training for Employment Program (STEP) scholarship 

program that remained undistributed and left in the storage which exposes 

the items to further deterioration and of which valuation may need 

reassessment in NCR- Muntinlupa, Paranaque, Las Piñas, Taguig, Pateros 

District Offices (MuntiPaLas-TaPat). The recorded value as of December 31, 

2020 amounted to ₱1,872,511.98.  

 

7.12 We recommended that the Management assess the condition and 
carrying value of the inventory held for distribution and recognize 

impairment loss and/or write-down inventory for the obsolete toolkits, 

as deemed necessary. 

 

d. Non-adoption of weighted average cost method on costing of inventories - 
₱7,388,726.23 

 

7.13 Section 6, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, clearly states that: 
 

Sec. 6. Weighted Average Method. The weighted average method shall be 

used for costing inventories. This method calls for the re-calculation of the 

average cost of all items in stock after every purchase. Therefore, the 

weighted average cost is the total cost of all units subsequent to the latest 

purchase, divided by their total number of units available. The Accounting 

Division/Unit shall be responsible in computing the cost of inventory on a 

regular basis. 

 



60 

 

7.14 However, audit of the costing method used by various TESDA offices in 
Region IV-B, PO Marinduque, TPSAT, BSAT, PPSAT showed that 

inventories costing ₱7,388,726.23 was not valued using the weighted average 

method. 

  

7.15 Office supplies of the Agency are maintained and recorded through First in 
First out (FIFO) costing method. Hence, cost of inventory as of yearend is 

based upon the latest purchase. FIFO method of costing will show a higher 

amount of Inventory, if there is inflation, in the Statement of Financial 

Position as at year-end. Whereas in the weighted average, the cost of goods 

purchased are evenly calculated. 

 

7.16 We recommended that the Management of the concerned TESDA offices 
to direct the Supply Officer/FA to adopt the weighted average method 

in costing supplies and materials inventory of the agency, in compliance 

with Section 6, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

7.17 The Management of the concerned offices expressed their adherence to the 
audit recommendations. 

 

e. Non-adoption of Perpetual Inventory Method of recording supplies and 
materials purchased - ₱ 32,080,572.43 

 
Standards 

Chapter 8, Volume I of GAM for NGAs 

Section 9 Perpetual Inventory Method.  Supplies and materials purchased for 

inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual inventory system, 

resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running total for the 

cost of goods sold in each period.  The system requires accounting records 

to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the 

maintenance of the SLC (Appendix 57) by the Accounting Division/Unit 

and Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) by the Supply and/or Property 

Division/Unit for each item in stock. Regular purchases shall be coursed 

through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded as they 

take place except for supplies and materials purchased out of PCF for 

immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be charged directly to 

the appropriate expense accounts.   

Section 13 Inventory Accounting System. The Inventory Accounting System 

consists of the system of monitoring, controlling and recording of 

acquisition and disposal of inventory.  The system starts with the receipt of 

the purchased inventory items.  The requesting office in need of the 

inventory items, after the Property and Supply Division/Unit has 

determined that the items are not available in stock, shall prepare and cause 

the approval of the Purchase Request (PR) (Appendix 60).  Based on the 

approved PR and after accomplishing all the required procedures adopting 

a particular mode of procurement, the agency shall issue a duly approved 

Contract or Purchase Order (PO) (Appendix 61).    

 

Procedures relative to the obligation of allotment to cover the funding 

requirement of the Contract/PO and payment of the inspected and accepted 

deliveries are discussed under Chapter 3-Budget Execution, Monitoring 

and Reporting, and Chapter 6-Disbursements of this Manual.

It provides that after the physical inventory-taking, the Inventory Committee shall 

reconcile the results of the count with the property and accounting records.  xxx.  

 

On the other hand, the inventory listing of the equipment shall be checked with 

the PC maintained by the property as against the equipment ledger cards 

maintained by the Accounting and the total thereof shall be compared with those 

in the GL. All discrepancies between physical and book inventories must be 

investigated, cleared and reconciled immediately. If necessary, written 

explanation shall be required from accountable and responsible person/s. 

 

The controls are required to ensure fairness on the presentation of an Agency’s 

financial position. Weaknesses and inefficiencies in the reconciliation process 

often led to mistakes on the Statement of Financial Position and overall 

inaccuracies in the financial reporting of the agency. 

 

8. Audit of various PPE accounts revealed several deficiencies that resulted in a 
net understatement of the Asset’s net carrying value by ₱228,655,546.78. The 

misstatements likewise affected the assertions on existence, completeness, 

accuracy, valuation, presentation and disclosure, rights and obligations, and

8.2 The Management of the following Offices gave their comments: 
 

RO IUs/OUs  Management Comments 

NCR DO Manila 

As part of the Management’s initial step towards the identification of 

properties classified under the Other Assets account, a Memorandum 

dated June 3, 2021 was issued to the previous FA to provide the 

breakdown of the said account. 

 

On the disposal of unserviceable properties, the IIRUP was already 

prepared for unserviceable properties identified by the Property Unit as 

of April 30, 2021. A disposal will be scheduled for the one-time clean-

up of unserviceable properties. Notice will be provided to COA. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team will further examine the submitted reports and close 

monitoring on the DO’s compliance with the other recommendations 

shall be made.  

CAR 

RO 

Management commented that the unrecorded motor vehicles were 

already taken up in the books through JEV No. 2021-02-135 dated 

02/19/2021 and they agreed to determine the fair value and all the 

related expenses of the donated vehicle since the basis of recording was 

the salvage value. 

Kalinga PTC, 

Ifuago PTC, 

PO Apayao 

Management agreed to comply with the recommendation. 

BCSAT 

Management committed to establish/ update the Accounting Unit's 

PPELCs and reconcile with the latest physical count to address the 

audit findings. 

RTC Baguio 

Management commented that prior year's erroneous entries were 

already adjusted and corrected in the books of RTC per JEV No. 2021-

02-001 dated February 19, 2021. 

II 

RTC 

As for the unrecorded PPE items, for recent years, Management 

committed to recognize them in CY 2021. It will take a while to 

improve the process, procedures and system of property management 

but moving forward, Management assures to adhere to the applicable 

rules and regulations on property accounting treatment, safeguarding 

and management. 

ISAT, 

SICAT 
Management agreed with the recommendations. 

IV-A PO Rizal 

The omission of recording of the said account was unintentional as the 

FA was trying to search for evidence for the acquisition cost to be 

recognized and its corresponding Depreciation Expenses. 

 

In parallel with the audit recommendations, the Management has 

directed the concerned personnel to recognize the properties in the 

books along with the corresponding depreciation. 



71 

 

RO IUs/OUs  Management Comments 

V 

RO 

RO - The Management issued Memorandum Nos. 92-I and 93-I 

requiring the Accountant to effect the necessary adjusting entries to 

take up in the appropriate PPE accounts the unrecorded PPEs. 

 

The Management also issued Memorandum 96-1 directing the Property 

Officers of RO and RTC Pili to conduct actual count of the 

unserviceable properties to establish the correctness and veracity of 

every reported account balance. Memorandum 97-I was also issued 

directing reconstitution of the Inventory Committee and facilitate the 

necessary procedures as recommended. Directions were also given to 

the Accountant to take up the reclassification of Other Assets to their 

specific PPE accounts. 

PO Albay 
PO Albay - The Management commented that adjustments shall be 

made in the second quarter of 2021. 

VI 

NOPO The Management committed to adhere with the recommendations. 

PTS 

The Management expressed that they will take necessary actions to 

support the valuation. Report of outcome of actions taken shall be 

promptly submitted. 

VII PO Cebu 

The Management commented that this audit recommendation may not 

be implemented within this year for two reasons: political issues within 

the respective municipalities of POs; and budget for the expenses in 

titling the land. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team urged the Management to keep the Audit Team posted 

on the progress in the titling of the land. However, be it noted that the 

subject matter of the donated land contained herein solely refers to the 

donated land in Samboan. This land is supported both with the SB 

Resolution and Deed of Donation duly signed by the donor and donee. 

As such, this donation can now be titled and is free from any political 

intervention. 

VII RTC 

The Management has directed the new FA to prepare the correcting 

entry based on the recommended adjustments for February 28, 2021 

financial reports. He will submit a copy of the JEV to the Audit Team 

once posted. 

VIII 

PTC 

The FA explained that the identified misstatements were due to 

improper use of PPE account titles, thus the applied useful life to 

depreciate the procured PPEs was incorrect.  Moreover, she assured the 

Audit Team on the immediate correction of records based on the 

recommendation and in compliance with the pertinent provisions. 

 

The FA also admitted her hesitation to use unfamiliar account titles in 

recording purchased PPEs, thus resorted to recognizing these newly 

purchased PPEs as Other Machinery and Equipment or Other PPE. 

However, she assured the Audit Team regarding immediate 

reclassification of the cited items based on the recommendation 

presented. 

BCAT 
The Accountant-Designate committed to effect the corrections and 

adjust the books of accounts in March 2021. 



72 

 

RO IUs/OUs  Management Comments 

PO Samar 

The FA will conduct reconciliation of records with those of the Supply 

Officer-Designate; and will drop from the Other Assets account those 

assets whose values fall below the P15,000.00 threshold. 

 

Likewise, the FA will return all fully depreciated but serviceable PPE 

accounts including the corresponding accumulated depreciation, to 

their proper account classification. 

LNAIS 
The Bookkeeper assured that she will adjust the books to correct the 

deficiencies noted. 

IX RO, RTC 

The Management commented that Depreciation Expenses for 2020 

were generated thru e-NGAS and was the basis of recognizing the 2020 

Depreciation Expenses. Adjustments will be made this 2021 after re-

computation to correct the 2020 Depreciation Expenses. 

X 
RTC 

Tagoloan 

The Management has already instructed the FA-Designate and the 

Supply Officer-Designate to coordinate with TESDA PO Camiguin for 

securing the records for the transferred vehicle to TESDA RTC 

Tagoloan. Also, the FA-Designate and Supply Officer-Designate were 

instructed to record the vehicle both in Accounting and Report on the

submit the reports on March. 2, 2021. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team will monitor the compliance by Management on the 

audit recommendations along with their commitments.

8.6 We recommended that the Management of concerned TESDA offices: 
 

Region Recommendations 

I, IV-B, VI, VII • require the Accounting Division to make necessary adjustments in the 
books of accounts to recognize the unrecorded transfers/ 

purchases/construction of PPE and their related depreciation; and 

adjust unserviceable/ serviceable PPEs which were reclassified as Other 

Assets 

III, VIII • the Property Officer to immediately provide the Accounting Unit with 
relevant reports to make as basis of the latter in recording in the book of 

accounts; 

 

• Accounting Unit to prepare the necessary adjusting entries to reclassify 
the accounts affected. 

CO

VI, VII, IX, X 

• analyze the discrepancies between the balances in the RPCPPE and the 
Accounting records and adjust the balances accordingly in order to 

present fairly the balances of the affected accounts; 

 

• require the Property Officer to maintain PCs and the FA/ Accounting 
Division to maintain the PPELCs; 

 

• regularly reconcile the balances of PPE per Accounting and Property 
Management Office's records 

 

X • conduct a complete physical count of PPE, giving priority to locate the 
missing properties, and if established as missing, take immediate and 

appropriate action so that the person accountable thereof be held 

personally liable for their loss 

II • advise the Property Officer to include PPE items in the amount of 
₱3,877,978.00 in the RPCPPE to reconcile with the accounting records. 

 

8.7 The Management comments are as follows: 
 

Region Management Comments 

I, IV-B, 

VI, VII,  
The Management of the concerned agencies committed to implement the 

foregoing audit recommendations to properly establish the validity, accuracy 

and existence of their PPE accounts balances. 
II RTC, ISAT, SICAT - The Management agreed to the recommendations. 

III 

IV-A PTC Paliparan - The concerned officers, during the Exit Conference, commented that 

they have already adjusted the discrepancy noted and will submit the JEV to the Audit 

Team. 

  

JZGMSAT - The concerned officers admitted their lapses but assured compliance in 

the ensuing year. 

 

PTESDC Taytay - The Supply/Property Officer and FA had omitted to report the other 

equipment due to lack of turnover by the previous Property Officer. Nevertheless, 

upon verification in the books by the FA, the RPCPPE is now adjusted with 

corresponding inspection of equipment. 

IV-B The Management of the concerned Agencies committed to implement the foregoing 

audit recommendations to properly establish the validity, accuracy and existence of 

their PPE accounts balances. 



78 

 

Region Management Comments 

V RO - The Management issued Memorandum No. 92-1 directing the Accountant and 

Property/Supply Officer to maintain and update PPELCs and PCs and to reconcile 

their records periodically to ensure correctness of the balances of the PPE accounts in 

their records. 

VI All - Due to lack of manpower, the reconciliation process of the records between the 

Accounting and Property Offices were put on hold.  To address the problem, the 

Management hired an additional Job Order Assistant to record and update the PPELCs 

and PCs of both offices.  Reconciliation process will start upon the completion of the 

updating of both records. 

  

The Regional Director conducted a meeting with all Property Officers of the Regional 

Office, POs and TESDA Administered Schools to address the problem. Subsequent 

physical counts shall follow until April 2021, as agreed upon during the meeting.  

Reconciliation will be done by the Accounting and Property and Supply Units to 

determine the difference.  The second quarter of CY 2021 is the scheduled time to 

focus on reconciliation and come up with the correct accounts balances and verified 

as to the physical existence of the PPE. 

X RTC Iligan - The Supply Officer admitted that the unreconciled amount was his fault 

because their Agency is undermanned that no one can help her in preparing various 

records as he is the only one working in the Supply Division.  The head of HRMO 

assured that by this time he will do her best to assign even a Job Order personnel to 

help in the Supply Section. 

 

b.2  Non-provision or questionable provision for depreciation - ₱132,628,819.42 

 

8.8 Section 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provide that PPE 
gradually loses its ability to provide service over the course of time. Because 

of this, its cost needs to be distributed on a systematic basis over its useful 

life.   The allocated cost is referred to as depreciation. The depreciation 

charge for each period shall be recognized as expense unless it is included in 

the carrying amount of another asset. 

 

8.9 Further, Section 40 also dictates that temporary idle activity or abandonment 
of PPE does not preclude depreciating the asset, as future benefits are 

consumed not only through usage but also through obsolescence, and wear 

and tear. 

 

8.10 Audit of PPE accounts of TESDA Regions disclosed that depreciation 
expense recognized on various PPEs amounting to ₱132,628,819.42 was 

unreliable due to insufficient provisions made during the current year and 

questionable fluctuations on the amount of current year’s Accumulated 

Depreciation. Details are as follows:

39,807,046.09 There were items of PPE, of which useful life is 

still undetermined by the Management and some 

were set beyond the normal life, thus computation 

of the related depreciation was not facilitated. 

 

However, for some OUs, despite availability of 

information, no monthly depreciation has been 

recognized upon verification in the books of 

accounts. These OUs only record the 

Depreciation Expenses on annual basis. 

TOTAL   132,628,819.42   

 

8.11 We recommended the Management of the concerned offices to: 
 

a. ensure compliance with the accounting procedures on depreciation 
as provided under Section 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM by regularly 

providing the depreciation for all the PPE accounts; and 

 

b. instruct the Accountant/FA to provide the depreciation on the 
affected PPE accounts in accordance with the prescribed guidelines 

and to furnish a copy to the Audit Team with the schedule of the 

depreciation provided and the JEV. 

 

8.12 The Management of the following regions gave their comments: 
 

Region Management Comments 

I RTC - The Management took note of the recommendations and commented that these 

are to be recomputed by considering the life span of the assets/properties and would be 

adjusted accordingly. 

III GPSAT - The Management has agreed with the audit recommendations. 

V RPSI - The Management commented that the recommendations will be given priority 

upon the assumption of the newly hired Supply Officer. 

IX RO and RTC - The Management commented that Depreciation Expenses for 2020 were 

generated thru e-NGAS and was the basis of recognizing the 2020 Depreciation 

Expenses. Adjustments will be made this 2021 after re-computation to correct the 2020 

Depreciation Expenses. 

 

PO ZDN - The Management issued Memorandum No. 25 dated January 15, 2021 to the 

Accountant IV/concurrent FA to comply with the audit recommendations. Adjusting 

entries were already made in the 2020 Financial Reports to recognize the monthly 

Depreciation Expenses from January to December 31, 2020. Management gave the 

assurance that for the year 2021, Depreciation Expenses of PPEs will be recognized on 

a monthly basis in accordance with Section 27, Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM for 

NGAs. 



80 

 

Region Management Comments 

XII GSNSAT - The Management responded that the provision of depreciation for Property, 

Plant and Equipment was made at the end of the year. The Management instructed the 

Accountant to practice the provision of depreciation on a monthly basis to be able to 

provide relevant and accurate financial data pertaining to PPE accounts in any given 

period during the year. The Accountant was also reminded by the Management to 

recognize a depreciation for land improvement since it is classified as depreciable 

assets. 

 

b.3  Unaccounted/ Unsupported Balance of PPE - ₱50,529,721.75 

 

8.13 Audit of various PPE items of the TESDA regions showed that there were 
various PPEs recognized or still recorded in the books, of which no pertinent 

documents are available to support its recognition. Details are shown below:

8,423,548.77 Verification of records and inquiry from the Provincial 

FA disclosed the non-preparation of schedule of PPE for 

CY 2020. Likewise, no schedule for depreciation was 

provided to the Audit Team to support the reported 

account balances. 

V RO 39,699,518.31 There was an abrupt increase in the reported balance of 

PPE per book from year 2019 to 2020. However, 

correctness of the reported amount could not be verified 

due to lack of PPE schedules, ledger cards, inventory 

reports, and other documents to support the recorded 

balance of PPE as at yearend 

VII RO 1,398,854.67 Review of the Buildings Account of the RO revealed 

that there were no documents to support the recognition 

of amount recorded in the books. Moreover, the 

Management could not provide information on the 

current location of the building when the Audit Team 

inquired on its whereabouts. 

XI WNAS 1,007,800.00 There were no changes made in the Biological Asset 

account of the Agency to reflect the changes brought 

about by the purchases and sale of the breeding stocks 

and to account for the change on fair value in case of 

birth, death and physical change as well as price change. 

Further, these assets were not properly disclosed in the 

Notes to Financial Statements of the Agency. 

Total   50,529,721.75   

 

8.14 We recommended, and the Management agreed, to: 
 

Region Recommendations 

III • direct the Accounting Unit to prepare the schedules of PPE and depreciation 
expenses per fund cluster to support the reported PPE account balances; 

V • the Accounting and Supply Officer to conduct reconciliation and identify the 
reasons for the abrupt increase in the total recorded PPE for 2020 and 

provide the Audit Team copy of the same; 

• make adjusting entries or update the relevant PPE records as may be 
necessary; 



81 

 

Region Recommendations 

VII • exert more effort to find/locate and trace from its records the pertinent 
documents evidencing recognition of the building in the book of accounts; 

XI • require the Supply/Property Custodian to comply with the maintenance of 
an updated Biological Assets Property Card (BAPC) and to prepare and 

submit to the Accountant the Quarterly Report on Biological Assets (QRBA) 

to reflect physical and price changes; 

 

• direct the Accountant to enforce the submission of an Inspection and 
Acceptance Report (IAR) in case of purchases; 

 

• require the Accountant and the Supply/ Property Officer to reconcile 
balances of Biological Assets to reflect the accurate amount; and 

 

• direct the accountant to make adjusting entries to recognize the Biological 
Assets sold and accumulated surplus and determine their costs necessary in 

the determination of the cost of Biological Asset to be derecognized, as well 

as the loss or gain on sale of such Biological Assets. 

 

b.4   Ownership and valuation of properties not ascertained - ₱11,507,721.00 

 

8.15 PPSAS 17 clearly iterates that the cost of an item of PPE shall be recognized as an 
asset if, and only if: (a) it is probable that future economic benefits or service 

potential associated with the item will flow to the entity; and (b) the cost or 

fair value of the item can be measured reliably. 

 

8.16 Further, Sections 5 and 12, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states 
that: 

 

Section 5. Measurement at Recognition. PPE that qualifies for recognition 

as an asset shall be measured at cost. However, where the PPE is acquired 

through a non-exchange transaction, its cost shall be measured at its fair 

value as at the date of acquisition (Pars. 30 and 31, PPSAS 17). 

 

Section 12. Donation without Condition. Cost of PPE acquired through 

donation without condition shall be taken up at its fair value at the date it is 

acquired. All expenses incurred in connection with the donated asset, such as 

delivery and installation costs, shall be included in the amount recognized as 

asset. The fair value of the PPE shall be recognized as “Income from Grants 

and Donations in Kind.” 

 

8.17 Below are also the pertinent provisions under Presidential Decree (P.D) No. 
1445: 

 

Section 39 (2). In the case of deeds to property purchased by any government 

agency, the Commission shall require a certificate of title entered in favor of 

the government or other evidence satisfactory to it that the title is in the 

government. 

 

Section 63. Accounting for moneys and property received by public officials. 

Except as may otherwise be specifically provided by law or competent 



82 

 

authority all moneys and property officially received by a public officer in 

any capacity or upon any occasion must be accounted for as government 

funds and government property. Government property shall be taken up in 

the books of the agency concerned at acquisition cost or an appraised value. 

 

8.18 Ownership and valuation of various properties acquired and received from 
donors were found unrecorded due to the non-transfer of property titles, 

unknown fair market values and non-recording of the Accountant, thus 

caused understatement to the total PPE and Equity accounts. Consequently, 

there were also properties recorded in the books, of which the titles have not 

been transferred yet under the name of the Agency, exposing the government 

to unfavorable position in case of disputes. Details are shown in the next 

table.

Region Management Comments 

VI PTS - The current administration is taking actions regarding this matter. Appointment 

with the living donor is again set on March 3, 2021 to discuss matters regarding the 

transfer and the donor signified his full cooperation for the transfer of land title to 

PTS. Management shall take necessary action to facilitate the transfer of land title to 

PTS and support its valuation. Also, report of outcome of actions taken shall be 

promptly submitted.  

VII RO - PTRs were already sent to the concerned offices. As of February 19, 2021, 

signed and returned PTRs (from OUs) already received by the RO were already 

forwarded to the Accounting Office to facilitate preparation of adjustments. 

 

With regards to the buildings, Management agreed to coordinate with the RO for the 

eventual transfer of PTCs to TESDA-Cebu PO books. 

 

   b.5.   Capitalizable repairs and maintenance - ₱917,670.10 

 

8.21 There were also noted expenses incurred during the year that may be 
classified as capitalizable pursuant to the definition provided under Sections 

24 and 25 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.

(In PhP) Observation 

VIII CNSAT 917,670.10 There were various repairs and maintenance activities 

made by the operating unit that are initially reported as 

Expenses in the books. However, these enhancements 

may have an effect to the future economic benefits or 

service potential of the capital assets involved, and 

thus, should be capitalizable. 

TOTAL   917,670.10   

 

8.22 We recommended the Management to: 
 

a. identify from the construction/repairs and maintenance activities 

which among is to be capitalized or be considered as minor repairs 

and maintenance, pursuant to Sections 24 and 25 of GAM for 

NGAs, Volume I,  and properly make an adjustment in the books of 

accounts; 

 

b. use Construction in Progress account to monitor the accumulation 

of costs of ongoing projects, which meet the capitalization criteria; 

and  

 

c. the Supply Officer-Designate, to regularly submit to the FA the 

status of construction and the corresponding supporting documents 

for recording purposes. 

 

8.23 The Management commented that the FA will classify construction projects 
if they are to be capitalized and if they meet the capitalization criteria; 



85 

 

otherwise they will be treated as an expense.  Also, the Management 

promised to adhere to proper recording of assets in accordance with GAM 

for NGAs and to use Construction in Progress account to monitor the 

accumulation of cost starting March, 2021. 

 

c.    Other PPE Control Deficiencies 

 

8.24 Section 38 of Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, requires that the 
entity shall have periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done 

annually and presented in the RPCPPE as at December 31 of each year. 

 

8.25 Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I - The Chief 
Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE including 

work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record 

promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, 

depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset.  

For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise 

maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and 

disposition of the same.

Accountant committed to revert the unutilized funds 

after finalizing and confirming with the schools that no 

further billings are expected from them. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team appreciates the affirmation of the PO 

in remitting the unutilized funds to the BTr amounting 

to ₱1,924,916.00 while the amount of ₱232,320.00 is 

yet to be confirmed. Meanwhile, the Accounts Payable 

should be reduced by the total amount of 

₱2,157,236.00 since it constitutes the confirmed 

unexpended balance and recorded liability without 

billing or contractual obligation to pay cash. 

 

F.  INCOME 

Misstatements on Income –₱645,085.65 

 

11. The Income Accounts of TESDA PO Leyte and Agusan Del Sur School of Arts 

and Trades (ASSAT) were misstated by ₱645,085.65 due to erroneous 

recording of tax remittance, unrecorded training fees earned from conduct of 

training programs and prior years’ income recorded in the current year, thus 

caused overstatement to the recognized Accumulated Surplus/ (Deficit) for FY 

2020 and affected the fairness of the financial statements of the Agency. 
 

11.1 Chapter 5 of the GAM, Volume I, provide the standards, policies, guidelines 
and procedures in accounting for revenue and other receipts. Section 7 in 

this Chapter states that revenue from exchange transaction shall be 

measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue 

shall be recognized when it is probable that future economic benefits or 



93 

 

service potential will flow to the entity and these benefits can be measured 

reliably. 

 

11.2 Paragraph 7 of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 
provides Accrual Basis of accounting under which transactions and other 

events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its 

equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are 

recorded in the accounting records and recognized in the financial 

statements of the periods for which they relate. The elements recognized 

under accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue 

and expenses.

RO/OU Recommendation 

PO Leyte Require the FA to prepare adjusting journal entries.

ASSAT 

a. Direct the Bookkeeper to prepare the adjusting entries to correct the 
accounts affected and restate retrospectively the comparative FSs to fairly 

present the FS as of December 31, 2020. 



94 

 

b. Direct the Bookkeeper to coordinate with the Scholarship Focal Person at 
least on a quarterly basis to monitor the completed training programs so 

that any revenue from completed trainings will be properly recorded when 

earned regardless of when received. 

 

11.4 The Management of PO Leyte commented that reconciling items will be 
adjusted and correcting entries will be prepared. 

 

Deficiency in the recognition of Income  

 

12. Accrual basis of recording income was not observed by TESDA RTC and 
ASSAT, contrary to Section 6, Chapter 2 of the GAM, Volume I, thus resulted 

in unreliability of the recognized income and revenue for the year thereby 

affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements at year-end. 
 

12.1 Section 6, Chapter 2 of the GAM, Volume I, provides that each entity shall 
recognize and present its financial transactions and operations conformably 

to the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the International Public 

Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). Accrual basis, as defined in Section 

2(a) thereof, means a basis of accounting under which transactions and other 

events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its 

equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are 

recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the financial 

statements of the periods to which they relate. 

 

 

12.2 We recommended that the Management of TESDA RTC and ASSAT 
instruct the accountant to recognize income using the accrual system 

pursuant to the provisions of PPSAS 1 and Section 7(3), Chapter 5, 

Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. 

 

12.3 Management averred that the billing of scholarship fees of TESDA RTC is 
prepared by the Scholarship Focal whereas the Accounting staff recognizes 

its income upon receipt of collection of check payments, thus the accrual

recommendation and pursuant to the provisions of PPSAS 1 and GAM, both 

the scholarship focal and accounting staff shall coordinate on the training 

cost rendered by each qualification to facilitate the recognition of income 

upon accrual in accordance with the set rules and regulations. 

 

G. EXPENSES 

 

a. Misstatement of Expenses Account - ₱19,923,018.41 
 

13. Expenses Account was overstated by ₱19,923,018.41 due to accounting errors 
in recording a PPE as outright expense and recognizing expenses incurred in 

prior year as expenses in current year, thus understated the PPE and 

Accumulated Surplus/Deficit accounts of the entity and affected the fair 

presentation of the FS. 
 

13.1  Section 6(b), Chapter 2 of the GAM, Volume I, states that each entity should 
recognize and present its financial transactions and operations conformably 

to accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the IPSAS. Accrual Basis 

of the Manual is construed to mean: 

 

Accrual basis – means a basis of accounting under which 

transactions and other events are recognized when they occur 

(and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). 

Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the 

accounting records and recognized in the financial statements 

of the periods to which they relate. 

 

13.2  COA Circular No. 2013-002 dated January 30, 2013 prescribes the adoption 
of the Revised Chart of Accounts by all National Government Agencies and 

states that the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit), formerly named Government 

Equity and amended under COA Circular No. 2014-003, is used to record 

cumulative results of normal and continuous operations of an agency 

including prior period adjustments, effect of changes in accounting policy 

and other capital adjustments. 

 

13.3  Sec. 8, Chapter 10, GAM, Volume 1, states that during the construction 
period, all expenses incurred in relation to the construction of the PPE shall 

be taken up in the books as Construction in Progress (CIP) with the 

appropriate asset classification. As soon as the construction is completed, 

the “Construction in Progress” account shall be reclassified to the proper 

asset account. Likewise, all expenses such as interests, license fees, etc., 

during the construction period shall be capitalized. 

 

13.4  Sec. 3, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs covers accounting 
policies on the criteria for recognition of PPE that requires the capitalization 

threshold of PPE of ₱15,000.00.

b. Non-submission of Disbursement Vouchers 
 

14. The validity and accuracy of disbursements or uses of public funds amounting 
to ₱757,531,623.35 were not determined due to non-submission of 

Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) and the necessary supporting documents by 14 

ROs to COA for audit/examination, thus affecting the reliability of the 

reported expenses for the period. 
 

14.1   Fourteen (14) ROs have been remiss in the submission of DVs and 
supporting documents to COA for audit that hindered the determination of 

the validity and accuracy of reported disbursements or uses of public funds

15. The transfer of P5.71 billion funds   by ROs to  OUs for the implementation 
of the scholarship/training programs on the basis of approved Qualification 

Maps (QMs) only instead of their actual requirements, wherein the P1.23 

billion and  ₱70.13 million  from the current and  continuing appropriations, 

respectively,  released to the latter only  in December 2020,  manifests the 

intent to avoid the lapsing of Notices of Cash Allocation (NCAs) that  resulted  

in the accumulation of unutilized/idle funds  in the Cash-LCCA of  TESDA 

OUs nationwide in the aggregate amount of P5.21 billion at yearend and 

exposing these funds to risk of possible misappropriation or improper 

disposition due to absence of control and proper monitoring, circumventing 

Item 4.0 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-12  dated November 21, 2013. 

 

15.1 TESDA is mandated to: a) integrate, coordinate, and monitor skills 
development programs; b) restructure efforts to promote and develop middle-

level manpower; c) approve skills standards and tests; d) develop an 

accreditation system for institutions involved in middle-level manpower 

development; e) fund programs and projects for technical education and 

skills development; and f) assist trainers training programs. 

 

15.2 To implement its mandate, TESDA offers major scholarship programs such 
as: a) Training for Work Scholarship Program (TWSP); b) Special Training 

for Employment Program (STEP); c) Private Education Student Financial 

Assistance (PESFA) and d) Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education 

(UAQTE). 

 

15.3 Out of the CO’s adjusted allotment of ₱7,955,641,589.00 for CY 2020, the 
total amount of ₱5,147,751,165.98 or 65 percent of the total allotment was

15.5 Due to the COVID-19 outbreak during the year wherein the government had 
imposed quarantine restrictions and lockdowns, the implementation of 

training programs was directly affected and most likely will result in non-

utilization of these program funds. 

 

15.6 It was further observed that the total amount of ₱1,307,999,950.00 or 27 
percent of the total fund transferred were only released in December 2020, 

which apparently assures its non-utilization. But what is more questionable 

is the fact that out of the total fund transfers made in December 2020, the 

amount of ₱70,132,712.00 was taken from the CY 2019 Continuing 

Appropriations, which authority to use already expired/lapsed at yearend. 

 

15.7 The condition is quite alarming because of the practice of the ROs to obligate 
and transfer funds in full to its OUs based only on the approved QMs 

probably to avoid the year-end lapsing of NCAs, even if no training has been 

conducted yet.  

 



101 

 

15.8 When funds are released to the OUs, they will be directly deposited to their 
respective Cash-LCCA account with authorized government depository bank 

(AGDB). But since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic which started in 

first quarter of CY 2020, the conduct of face- to- face trainings/assessments 

were suspended, hence millions of training funds may not be utilized and 

shall remain in the LCCA account of the OUs.  

 

15.9 Due to lack of control and monitoring of the unutilized funds by the ROs, 
millions of funds had accumulated annually and were retained at the OUs, 

wherein some are already due for reversion and should be returned to the 

National Treasury upon the lapse of the validity period to utilize. This long-

time practice had exposed public funds to risks of possible misappropriation 

due to the incapacity of the OUs to properly manage their financial operation 

for lack of capable and qualified financial staff. 

 

15.10 This practice had left millions of public funds under the direct control of the 
Head of the OUs and the designated Financial Analyst whose capability to 

handle the operations and financial matters of the Units is also questionable 

because most of them have no accounting background, related trainings and 

experience. This had also caused difficulty in the conduct of audit due to non-

maintenance of the required accounting records/books of accounts, lack of 

knowledge in the preparation of BRS as a basic control for cash, and late or 

non-submission of financial reports such as the DVs and other financial 

reports to COA for audit. 

 

A total of ₱5.1 billion fund transfer of scholarship programs funds were 

deposited/lodged in the Cash-LCCA account of the Provincial/District Offices of 

TESDA nationwide 

 

15.11 EO No. 91 dated September 9, 2019 provides the Guidelines on the Adoption 
of the Cash Budgeting System (CBS) for Fiscal Year 2019, and for other 

purposes. The EO was issued to improve the fiscal planning of government 

agencies through the implementation of operational cash budget and by 

setting deadlines for obligation of funds and execution of projects during the 

fiscal year, in order to speed up the implementation of programs and to 

promptly deliver goods and services to the people.  

 

15.12 Section 1 thereof provides, among others, that all funds transferred between 
or among government agencies and LGUs shall not be considered disbursed 

until the transferred amount have been actually utilized to pay for goods 

delivered and services rendered, inspected and accepted. 

 

15.13 Although utilization of the CY 2019 budget was extended up to December 
31, 2020 upon the approval of RA No. 11464 and likewise CY 2020 budget 

can still be utilized until December 2021 per RA No. 11520, but apparently 

the government is now more inclined to the adoption of the CBS, such that 

all government agencies, including TESDA, should have started to consider 

in the issuance of policies/guidelines to minimize the impact to program 

implementation once the CBS shall finally push through. 



102 

 

 

15.14 Moreover, Item 4.0 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-12 provides that all 
NCAs for crediting to the Regular MDS sub-accounts for any month, whether 

part of the comprehensive releases or constituting additional NCA releases, 

shall be valid until the last working day of the 3rd month of that quarter. In 

paragraph 6, it provides that “It is understood that all NCA balances at the 

end of each quarter are considered lapsed after the last working hour of said 

quarters.” 

 

15.15 Review was conducted on the utilization of program funds which covers 
analysis of the Cash in Bank, Local Currency, Current Account (LCCA), that 

showed a consolidated balance of ₱7,829,302,118.58 as of yearend. The 

balance is composed of the Regular Fund, Sariling Sikap Program Fund and 

Trust Fund. 

 

15.16 The analysis conducted was limited only on the Cash-LCCA for Fund 101 as 
the depository account of various scholarship funds that reflected a 

consolidated balance of ₱5,370,340,172.52, broken down per ROs as

15.18 The audit already noticed the huge amount of Cash in Bank balance of the 
DOs/POs of TESDA, which appears to be questionable since the officers 

concerned cannot even provide valid list of payable accounts to support the 



105 

 

retention of these funds. Moreover, the designated Financial Analyst does 

not maintain the required accounting records for purposes of audit and the 

DVs covering payment of trainings conducted by various trainings centers 

were not submitted on time and some actually failed to submit the DVs 

despite request/demands made. 

 

15.19 Review of the transaction of the ROs disclosed that all program funds 
released/transferred by TESDA CO thru Notice of Transfer Allocation 

(NTA) were directly transferred to their respective POs/DOs upon receipt 

based only on the approved QM and absorptive capacity, regardless whether 

the funded QMs were already conducted or when it will be conducted. 

 

15.20 This practice violated DBM rules and regulations on the proper incurrence 
of obligations and circumvented the rules on the validity of NCA that resulted 

in unauthorized or improper retention and accumulation of funds at the POs 

and DOs and exposing these funds to possible misappropriation due to lack 

or absence of qualified financial staff to monitor and control their 

disbursement/utilization. 

 

15.21 We recommended that TESDA CO direct/instruct the:  
 

• ROs to transfer funds to OUs not only based on the approved QMs 
but also in accordance with their actual requirements and the 

reported actual Due and Demandable Accounts to prevent the 

accumulation of funds at the OUs. 

 

• ROs to comply strictly with DBM guidelines on the incurrence of 
obligation, utilization of NCAs, and validity of appropriation; and 

 

• ROs to closely monitor unutilized cash subsidy already due for 
return/reversion to the National Treasury but still retained at the 

OUs. 

 

15.22 Management’s Comment: 
 

We quote Management’s comments: “TESDA is one with the Commission in 

ensuring that only the highest quality of service will be given to the public we 

serve. We continue to invest in our people through the provisions of various 

training programs for personnel development. TESDA is also in the process 

of achieving a level of HRM primarily in line with its goal to further 

strengthen the recruitment, selection and placement system to ensure a 

stronger, more qualified TESDA workforce.” 

 

15.23 Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 
 

We acknowledge Management’s commitment to provide the highest quality 

of service, however, said commitment should go hand in hand with the 

institution of a strong internal control system for the proper management and 



106 

 

utilization of public funds and strict compliance with government rules and 

regulations. 

 
 

Audit of COVID-19 Funds 
 

Implementation of RA No. 11469, the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act  

 

16. TESDA reported in its Financial Accountability Report (FAR) a 96 percent 
obligation rate of the total allotments transferred to the ROs of 

P768,553,945.45, out of the P950 million allotments for the Bayanihan 2 and 

disbursement rate of 66 percent thereof, which, however, does not match with  

the Physical Accomplishments for CY 2020 submitted by the Scholarship 

Management Division (SMD), which reported the number of scholars enrolled 

of only 33,555 or 59 percent of the total allocated training slots of 57,000, with 

actual number of graduates of 3,139 or nine percent of the total number of 

scholars enrolled. Such disparities are attributed to the practice of the ROs to 

immediately obligate and transfer to OUs all scholarship allocation based only 

on the approved QMs and report the same as utilized/disbursed upon release 

thereof.  

 

Although the program implementation was extended up to June 30, 2021, the 

actual full utilization of the funds and realization of the objective of the 

program for the retooling, retraining and upskilling of the target beneficiaries 

may not be attained since the  release of funds to ROs was not based on the 

actual needs or the expected number of targeted beneficiaries per 

district/region but on the budget allocation  per Congressional District, and in 

view of the fact that the Recovery Intervention Program also pertains to 

conduct of  scholarship trainings which is directly affected by quarantine 

restrictions and lockdowns imposed by the government due to COVID-19 

outbreak.  

 

       Other deficiencies were also observed in the procedures/process at the     CO, 

ROs and OUs in the implementation of the program under the Bayanihan 2. 

 

16.1 Presidential Proclamation No. 922 s. 2020 was issued declaring a State of 
Public Health Emergency throughout the Philippines due to the Coronavirus 

Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Thereafter, the country was placed under a State 

of Calamity with the corresponding imposition of various Community 

Quarantines. Cognizant of the adverse impact of COVID-19, the 

government established a mechanism for the State to better respond to the 

challenges brought about by the pandemic. RA No. 11469 or the Bayanihan 

to Heal as One Act and RA No. 11494 or the Bayanihan to Recover as One 

Act were promulgated to ensure that there is efficient, adequate and readily 

available funding to undertake the various programs of the government to 

mitigate the effect of the pandemic, immediately mobilize assistance for 

provisions of basic necessities, undertake measures that will prevent the 

overburdening of the health care system and ultimately to promote and 

protect the collective interest of the general public.   

 



107 

 

16.2 In line with the government’s effort to sustain COVID-19 response and 
recovery interventions on the adverse effects and serious threat of the 

COVID-19 pandemic to health, safety, security and livelihood under 

Section 10 (1) of RA No. 11494, ₱1,000,000,000.00 was appropriated to 

TESDA which shall be utilized for the retooling, retraining and upskilling 

of the target beneficiaries. Through its scholarship programs, TESDA shall 

be able to provide recovery interventions and economic assistance to all 

displaced workers in support of the government's efforts to bolster the 

resilience of the Philippine economy amid the continuing national 

emergency. 

 

16.3 TESDA received an actual allocation of P950,000,000.00 under Special 
Allotment Release Order (SARO) No. BMB-A20-0018459 as additional 

scholarship funds of TESDA under its Training for Work Scholarship 

Program (TWSP). The funds are to be allocated to the ROs through the 

issuance of Notice of Transfer of Allocation (NTA).

16.6 Review of the fund allocation per ROs disclosed that TESDA CO simply 
allocated ₱3 million pesos budget per Congressional District/Party List 

without identifying the actual needs of the area or those localities with the 

greatest number of displaced workers and OFWs, thus may defeat the 

purpose of Bayanihan Act 2 that the Scholarship Programs shall be for the 

retooling, retraining, and upskilling of displaced workers including 



109 

 

returning OFWs to reduce the adverse impact of COVID-19.  Moreover, the 

allocation made runs counter with the TESDA policy that the Regional 

Operations Management Office (ROMO) shall prepare and recommend the 

basis in the equitable distribution of the Bayanihan 2 Fund.

16.9 As can be gleaned from the foregoing information, it appears that the 
reported utilization/obligation rate of 96 percent does not correspond to the 

number of scholars enrolled of 33,555 which is only 59 percent of the total 

allocated training slots of 57,000. Likewise, the disbursement rate of 66 

percent does not correspond to the actual number of graduates of 3,139 or 9 

percent of the total number of scholars enrolled. The inconsistencies in 

information are again attributed to the practice of the ROs to immediately 

obligate and transfer to OUs all scholarship allocation based only on the 

approved QMs. Upon release, it is already reported as 

utilization/disbursement.  



110 

 

 

16.10 We recommended that Management: 
 

• direct the Offices involved in the processing to properly coordinate 
and observe timelines; 

 

• streamline the processing time of the concerned Offices to expedite 
the release of funds to ROs/POs with approved Regional 

Qualification Maps (RQMs); 

 

• be more prudent and objective in the determination of beneficiaries 
and in the allocation of scholarship funds, to provide equitable 

distribution of scholarship allocations based on the recommended 

distribution per sector and per target client including the target 

number of beneficiaries per sector and per priority client, and to 

observe the standard procedures of identifying TVIs; and 

 

• instruct the ROs to release fund to DOs/POs based only on reported 
actual Due and Demandable Accounts. 

 

16.11 The following are the Managements’ Comments: 
 

• Management commented that due to the urgency of the implementation 
of Bayanihan 2 or the “Bayanihan to Recover as One Act,” with its 

extremely short validity of allotment, TESDA considered the 

importance of the roles of Members of the House of Representatives 

(HOR) in determining priority areas for TESDA assistance that are 

affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

  

• The Authority manifested that there were no intentions to violate the 
procedures on the implementation of the project and expose the fund to 

abuse. Its only intention is to distribute the budget equally among the 

legislative Districts/Regions. The universalism of the budget was 

observed as it is distributed uniformly across Districts. 

 

16.12 The Audit Team acknowledged the short validity of the allotment which was 
already extended up to June 30, 2021. But the participation of the members 

of the HOR should only be limited to providing data as to their actual needs. 

TESDA should not have resulted in a uniform allocation without taking into 

consideration the needs of the area/District to maximize utilization. 
 

16.13 There were also deficiencies observed in the procedures/process at the     
CO:

ROs 1 and CAR 10 persons listed as scholars of Bayanihan 2 with a specified 

date to have finished the training program but were validated 

as not enrolled, dropped and one was not even a TESDA 

scholar, thus requires investigation by TESDA to ensure that 

payments to TVIs are valid and duly supported with 

legitimate information/documentation. 

 

ROs CAR, I, XIII Multiple availment of trainings/courses with overlapping

the authenticity of the report and the identity of reported 

beneficiaries, contrary to TESDA Circular No. 1l. 

 

CARAGA The implementation of programs by TVIs was conducted 

ahead or in advance since it was done earlier than the release 

of SARO on November 10, 2020, hence charges made to the 

Bayanihan funds may be considered as irregular.

CAR, I, XIII Require the implementing ROs to investigate and explain the 

multiple trainings availed by the scholars with overlapping dates, 

which is not in accordance with the TESDA Circular No. 11. 

CARAGA Require the CARAGA RO to further review the programs 

implemented and provide justification on the charging of these 

programs to Bayanihan 2 funds. Otherwise, they should be 

reclassified and charged to the regular funds, subject to 

availability of funds, or may be a valid ground for the issuance of 

Notice of Suspension/Disallowance. 

 

16.16 The following are the Managements’ Comments and Audit Team’s 
Rejoinder. 

 
RO/OUs Management’s Comments/Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

CAR Management has committed to comply with the recommendations and assured 

that they will strictly monitor the training programs for prompt release of the 

allowances for the scholars to obtain full benefits of the program. 

VI- NOPO Management committed to ensure that the remaining training programs to be 

implemented will be intended only to the priority target beneficiaries and will 

conduct a Registrar’s Forum to remind them of their accountability and 

responsibility especially on the data being encoded in the T2MIS. 

 

The Management committed that they will instruct the Scholarship and 

Accounting Sections to conduct inventory for all ongoing training programs that 

allowances were not yet released and direct the TVI concerned to submit 

supporting documents for the payment of allowances.  

VI-PO Capiz Management commented that trainings conducted for CY 2020 were six out of 19, 

which was more than the declared slots in the Catch-up Plan for FY 2020. 

Qualification for SMAW NCI-25 slots has started on 12/18/2020 and Plumbing-

25 slots has started on 12/19/2020. Likewise, TESDA Memo No. 014, 2021 dated 

January 7, 2021 stated that: 3.2 Bayanihan 2 Fund shall only be available for 

release, obligation and disbursement up to June 30, 2021. Therefore, the remaining 

slots will still be in accordance with the Secretary’s directives and without 

prejudice to COA’s regulations. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

For Region VI, in the initial report on the Status of Implementation of FY 2020 



114 

 

TWSP submitted by the Agency received by the Audit Team through email on 

January 7, 2021, it was reported that training for only three qualifications were 

conducted for CY 2020. However, a phone call was received later to inform the 

Audit Team that trainings for four qualifications and not three were indeed 

conducted and a revised Status Report was submitted to the Audit Team, hence the 

observation that only four trainings were conducted. The Audit Team relies on the 

reliability of report submitted by the Agency on data to be included in the Audit 

Team’s Report and until or unless the same was revised by the Agency, 

figures/data therein are considered final and correct since they are in the position 

to know the status of their programs, subject to validation of the Audit Team. 

 

The Audit Team agreed that  funds released for Bayanihan 2 Fund is still available 

for release, obligation and disbursement up to June 30, 2021, that is why the 

observation is not on the obligation and disbursement of the fund but rather on the 

trainings conducted as per targeted training dates and the availability/ non-

availability of the TVIs to conduct the trainings within 10 calendar days from 

indicative date of the Start of the Training Program identified in the PQM in 

accordance with TESDA Circular No. 1 series of 2020 or the Omnibus Guidelines 

for TESDA Scholarship Programs. 
XI- 

PO Davao Del 

Norte 

The PO closely coordinated with the two Congressional Offices to expedite the 

crafting and finalization of the QMs. They said that it took them three days and 

immediately submitted these to RO as inputs to the consolidated Regional QMs. 

While waiting for the approval of the RQM, the PO had coordinated with the 

concerned Congressional Offices and identified training providers. Upon receipt 

of the approved RQM, the training programs immediately commenced. While 

there were some delays, all programs have started in CY 2020. The error was then 

corrected. The PO focal person shall exercise judicious encoding and review. 

XI-PO Davao 

Oriental 

The approval of RQM was dated on November 27, 2020 and was emailed to the 

PO on December 2, 2020. Their implementation commenced on the date they 

received a copy of the approved RQM. They have encountered a lot of challenges 

during this pandemic in the implementation of the training program in 

consideration of some LGUs in Davao Oriental having exposure/cases of COVID-

19. The PO is strictly implementing the program in accordance with the procedures 

and guidelines, however, there are situations in the field that pertain to health and 

safety that are given consideration. The concerned TVI had written the PO and 

then forwarded to RO re: Justification on the delayed implementation due to 

challenges during this pandemic. 

 

16.17 Other deficiencies were noted, as follows:

Deficiencies on issued guidelines and policies of TESDA 

Central 

Office 

The documentary 

requirements on payments to 

Technical Vocational 

Institutions (TVIs) for 

trainings conducted as 

provided in TESDA Circular 

No. 078 series of 2020 are  

not adequate to determine 

actual attendance of the 

scholars, conduct of trainings 

by TVIs and receipt of the 

Training Support Fund (TSF) 

by the rightful claimant, that 

could  facilitate the 

perpetration of irregularity in

Require TVIs to submit 

additional documents to 

support their claim for 

payment such as but not 

limited to pictures and

Require the TVIs to submit 

additional documents 

which disclose the mode of 

releasing of TSF to scholars 

as well as the account

The Management is reviewing 

the concerned policies and 

issuances in order to effect the 

necessary amendments and 

supplemental guidelines to 

ensure integrity of the 

TESDA Scholarship 

Program. However, the 

Management would like to 

manifest that the primary 

intent of introducing such 

flexible arrangements in the

The Central Office 

Management would like to 

clarify that it is the 

POs/District Offices (DOs) 

who are responsible in the 

release of allowances directly 

to the scholars as provided for 

in Section XIV of TESDA 

Circular No. 11, 2020. 

Furthermore, Section VIII (2) 

(d) of TESDA Circular No. 

078 requires that the 

acceptance/receipt by the 

scholars of the TSF and other 

allowances shall be supported 

with applicable documentary 

evidence depending on the 

mode of release of said 

allowance. Nevertheless, the 

Management will review the 

existing guidelines and to 

possibly consider COA’s 

recommendation. 

 Insufficient guidelines on the 

criteria for selection of 

beneficiaries of the 

Bayanihan Fund may result in 

the difficulty in ascertaining 

the recipients who are 

authorized and in accordance 

with the Act. 

We recommended that the 

Management provide 

specific guidelines on how 

the priority targeted 

beneficiaries are to be 

identified in accordance 

with the Bayanihan 2 

intervention program. 

 

Non-compliance with audit requirements  

Central 

Office 

Only five (5) out of seventeen 

(17) ROs have submitted their 

T2MIS report/data despite 

several follow-up letters, thus 

restricting the Audit Team’s 

audit scope and authority to 

determine compliance with 

the Bayanihan 2 Recovery 

Program guidelines and 

procedures and the respective 

accomplishment/performance 

of the Implementing Units. 

Management require the 

ROs to submit the T2MIS 

reports with regard to the 

implementation of the 

Bayanihan 2 Recovery 

Program, in view of COA’s 

authority to audit pursuant 

to Section 2 (D) of Article 

IX of the 1987 

Constitution. 

The Management noted the 

deficiencies/irregularities 

seen by COA that require 

further review/investigation. 

As initial step, the Director 

General issued Memorandum 

No. 236 s. 2021 to all 

Regional Directors requiring 

them to submit an explanation 

relative to said audit findings. 

 

The consolidated responses 

and explanations of the 

concerned Region will be 

submitted to COA as part of 

the Management’s action.

Observation Recommendations Management Comments 

Their recommendation will 

also be used to improve the 

monitoring system. 

 

Fund Transfers to ROs for the implementation of EO No. 70 without proper authority 

and appropriate guidelines for the disposition of the funds 

 

17. Fund transfers through Notice of Transfer Allocation (NTA) from TESDA 
CO to TESDA ROs for the implementation of EO No. 70, creating the National 

Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC), 

amounting to ₱160,083,401.61 are highly questionable for lack of proper 

authority/legal basis and the absence of appropriate guidelines as to how this 

fund shall be utilized, likewise exposing these funds to possible misuse or 

misappropriation. 

 

17.1 Section 4, PD 1445, states that financial transactions and operations of any 
government agency shall be governed by the fundamental principles set 

forth hereunder, to wit: 

 

“No money shall be paid out of any public treasury or depository except 

in pursuance of an appropriation law or other specific statutory 

authority.” 
 

17.2 Audit showed that from the CY 2020 appropriation, TESDA-CO 
transferred to ROs a total amount of ₱160,083,401.61 for the 

implementation of EO No. 70, the broken down as follows:

17.3 The Audit Team had requested for any authority for said fund transfers or 
budget reallocation, but nothing was submitted as of this report. 

 

17.4 EO No. 70, creating the NTF-ELCAC, and directing the adoption of a 
National Peace Framework was approved by President Duterte on 

December 4, 2018, and under Section 3 thereof, the Director General of 

TESDA was designated as one of the members. 

 

17.5 Section 9 provides that the initial funding requirement for the 
implementation of the said order shall be charged against existing 

appropriation of member-agencies of the Task Force and such other 

appropriated funding sources as the DBM may identify, and when 

necessary, the Contingent Fund, subject to relevant laws, rules and 

regulations. 

 

17.6 However, the above provision is not clear as to how the charges to 
appropriation of the member-agencies shall be made and what are the 

requirements as basis or authority for the charging. Considering that the 

CY 2020 TESDA appropriation was intended for the implementation of the 

Agency’s programs/projects pursuant to its mandate, the funds should have 

been utilized in accordance with the purpose (Sec. 17 FY 2020 GAA). 

 

17.7 EO No. 70 and its activities were not among the identified funded 
programs/projects in the current year’s appropriation of TESDA and no 

Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) from the DBM was issued that 

authorized the reallocation of funds to cover the above fund transfers, 

which contravenes Section 4 of PD No. 1445. 

 

17.8 Moreover, provisions of EO No. 70 do not give specific authority to 
member Agencies to exercise sole discretion to allot funds for its 

implementation out of its appropriation and in the absence of implementing 

guidelines. More so, with the grant of fund augmentation for the same 

purpose when the needs have not yet been established. 

 

17.9 Initial review of the ₱6,000,000.00 fund augmentation for ELCAC in 
Region XII showed questionable activities and budget allocation as shown  

In the next table:

17.10 Absence of authority and guidelines may just expose these funds to 
possible misuse of misappropriation. 

 

17.11 We recommended that Management provide legal authority/ basis for 
the fund transfers of ₱160,083,401.61 to ROs for the implementation 

of EO  No. 70,  for this may be a ground for technical malversation of 

public funds. 

 

17.12 Management’s Comments are as follows: 
 

a.     The ₱147,383,401.61 total releases to the ROs were taken out of the 
TESDA Centrally Managed Funds, specifically the TESDA 

Scholarship Funds which was fully funded under the FY 2020 GAA. 

The Centrally Managed Scholarship Funds were intended for 

distribution to the ROs subject to TESDA scholarship rules and 

regulations for the implementation of various programs intended to 

benefit a diverse group of beneficiaries. 

 

b.    The transfer of funds to the regions was in accordance with following 

provisions: 

 

• Section 9 of EO No. 70 provides that the initial funding 
requirement for the implementation of the said Order shall be 

charged against existing appropriation of member-agencies of the 

Task Force, xxx. 

 

• TESDA Circular No. 011, 2. 2020 dated January 23, 2020: 
Omnibus Guidelines for TESDA Scholarship Programs, providing 

definition of Special Clients to include, 1) farmers and fishermen, 

2) workers in the informal sectors, 3) migrant workers, 4) 

indigenous people and cultural communities, 5) women, 6) 

persons with disability, 7) senior citizens 8) victims of calamities 

and disasters, 9) out of school youth, 10) urban poor. Furthermore, 

special beneficiaries also cover solo parents and their children, 

OFWs and their dependents, drug surrenderers and their 

dependents, victims of human trafficking, wounded-in-action or 

killed-in-action AFP and PNP personnel and their dependents, 

returnees, inmates and detainees and their dependents, micro-

entrepreneurs and their dependents, members of cooperatives, 

internally displaced population and other related or similarly 

situated clients. 

 

• DBM issued the FY 2020 Salient Features which contain allotted 
budget for certain programs, which include, among others, the 

₱45,900,000.00 intended for the implementation of EO No. 70.  



119 

 

 

17.13 Audit Team’s Rejoinder are as follows: 
 

•  As already stated, Section 9 of EO No. 70 does not give sole discretion 
to the head of the member Agency to utilize its approved budget for the 

implementation of EO No. 70, especially if there is no well-defined 

approved program of activities and no guidelines were specifically 

formulated for its utilization. 

 

• Special Clients of TESDA Scholarship Program as defined in its 
Omnibus Guidelines for Scholarship Programs is already all-

encompassing, and actually includes those targeted beneficiaries in 

support of EO No.70, hence to transfer funds specifically for the 

implementation of AO No. 70, is questionable since the regular training 

programs of TESDA can readily cater to the needs of the targeted clients. 

 

• The attached caption of FY 2020 Salient Features said to be issued by the 
DBM cannot be relied upon as it may not represent the real intent of the 

said issuance as the approved/signed full text was not presented. 

 

  Fund transfer for Fund Augmentation to ROs for various purposes, contrary to    

Section 68, of FY 2020 GAA and Section 4, PD No. 1445 
 

18. Fund transfers to ROs as fund augmentation for various purposes amounting 
to ₱39,954,475.202 contravene the rules on fund augmentation provided 

under the GAA of FY 2020 and Section 4 of PD No. 1445 on the prohibition 

on payment without valid appropriation or law allowing the same. 
 

18.1 Republic Act (RA) No. 11465 or the General Appropriations Act of FY 2020 
provides that: 

 

Section 68. Rules on Augmentation. Augmentation is the act of the 

constitutional officers authorized to use savings in their respective 

appropriations to cover a deficiency in any existing item of appropriation 

within their offices. A deficiency in an item of appropriation may result 

from: 

 

a)  unforeseen modifications or adjustments in the program, activity or 
project; or 

 

b) Re-assessment in the use, prioritization and/or distribution of 
resources. 

 

   An item of appropriation shall pertain to the amount appropriated for 

an activity or project authorized in this Act. 

 

   The particulars of the expenditures to be funded from savings should 

be within the scope of, or covered by an existing activity or project. 



120 

 

The existence of an activity or project regardless of the availability of 

allotment class/es is sufficient for the purpose of augmentation. 

 

In no case shall a non-existent activity or project be funded by 

augmentation from savings or by the use of an appropriations 

authorized in this Act. 

 

18.2 In CY 2020, an aggregate amount of ₱39,954,475.20 was transferred to 
several ROs as fund augmentation for various purposes charged against the 

CYs 2019 and 2020 allotments, as shown in the table below:

18.3 Based on the above cited guidelines, TESDA is not among those government 
Agencies that can grant fund augmentation as such is only exercise by those 

Agencies authorized by law to utilize their savings. The fund augmentation 

in effect had increased the appropriation of the foregoing ROs without 

authority/basis. 

 

18.4 It has to be emphasized the transfers to ROs should be in accordance with the 
GAA, TESDA CO has no authority to augment funds of the ROs even if it 

has the available savings, more so if the activities/program is not covered by 

an appropriation. 

 

18.5 We recommended that Management provides authority or basis for the 
grant of fund augmentation to ROs and explain why this should not be 

considered as technical malversation of public funds and be disallowed 

in audit. 

 

18.6 Management’s Comment: 
 

• That the amount of ₱2,135,569.70, which was allocated for ROs I, II, 
IV, V, XI, XII and CARAGA was taken from the ₱45,900,000.00 

intended for the implementation of programs under training-cum 

production in support to EO No. 70. Therefore, releases were not 

without valid appropriations. 

 

• The remaining ₱26,740,740,596.50 was taken out of the Agency’s 
savings generated as a result of the economy measures implemented by 

TESDA Central Office. 

 

 

 

 



122 

 

18.7 Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 
 

As already stated, fund augmentation through use of savings are only 

allowed to government entities with fiscal autonomy and has authority to 

utilize their savings. TESDA has no authority to utilize savings for fund 

augmentation without authority from the DBM. The Agency should also 

present how the savings was generated and from what program of activity it 

was generated. 

 

Fund Transfers to ARMM/BARMM 

 

19. Fund transfers to TESDA RO - Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao 
(TESDA-ARMM) now changed to Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in 

Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) were not covered by a Memorandum of 

Agreement (MOA), and for CY 2020 a total amount ₱62,364,533.60 was also 

allotted and obligated for transfer for the conduct of various trainings despite 

existing outstanding/unliquidated balance of ₱42,398,983.10.  Moreover, the 

Audit Team of RO IX reported unutilized Scholarship Funds allocated for 

BARMM amounting to ₱19,412,917.22, which are already due for reversion 

due to lapsed validity period to utilize.  

 

19.1 Being an Autonomous Region, the ARMM is not within the direct control 
and supervision of TESDA, hence all fund transfers were taken up in the 

books as Due from National Government Agencies subject to liquidation. 

However, review of the documents attached to the fund transfer vouchers, 

showed that no MOA  was attached as basis for the release of funds to the 

Region. 

 

19.2 It is the Audit Team’s opinion that since TESDA-ARMM, now replaced by 
BARMM after the plebiscite held on January 21, 2019, is a separate and 
distinct government entity, a MOA should have been executed as basis for 

the fund transfers and to establish accountability/responsibility over 

government funds transferred and entrusted to them. The absence of the 

MOA may consider the fund transfers as irregular  and the ARMM may not 

be obligated to implement the training programs of TESDA and comply 

with the requirements in accordance with TESDA-prescribed guidelines. 

 

19.3 As of yearend, a total amount of ₱62,364,533.60 was obligated and the 
liability account Due to NGAs was already established for another release 

of fund transfers. However, verification of the ARMM’s SL showed that it 

has still an outstanding, unliquidated balance of ₱42,398,983.10, broken 

down as follows:

123 

 

19.4 Moreover, the Regional Consolidated Management Letter (RCML) of RO 
IX had reported unutilized Scholarship Funds allocated for BARMM 

amounting to ₱19,412,917.22 but already due for reversion due to lapsed 

validity period to utilize, details of which are as follows:

2020 BARMM STEP 2,727,834.80 

Total 19,412,917.22 

 

19.5 This information showed inconsistencies on the procedures/process of 
TESDA CO on how the scholarship allocation for BARMM, which replaced 

the ARMM, shall be released or channeled. 

 

19.6 We recommended that Management should: 
 

a. explain why fund transfer to TESDA-ARMM was not covered by 
a MOA; and why 2019 scholarship funds were released to RO IX 

when BARMM is considered as an independent RO, and 

 

b. avoid further grant of fund transfer if the previous grants are not 
yet fully liquidated or settled. 

 

19.7 Management commented that while the amount in question was obligated 
for transfer to TESDA Regional Office-Autonomous Region in Muslim 

Mindanao (TESDA-ARMM) on the basis of the request from the SMD, 

supported by approved qualification map, there was no actual transfer of 

fund made when upon checking in the records of the Accounting Division 

there remained an unliquidated balance of ₱42,398,983.10. The 

aforementioned unliquidated balance of TESDA-BARMM was reduced to 

₱22,191,172.98 as of July 5, 2021. Attached is a copy of MOA between 

TESDA and BARMM signed and notarized on November 23, 2021. 

 

19.8 Audit Teams Rejoinder: 
 

• There should be no additional fund transfer unless the previous fund 
transfers are fully liquidated considering that BARMM has another set 

of appointed officers, there should be a turn-over report signed by the 

previous officers of ARMM and the BARMM. 

 

• The newly executed contract between TESDA and BARMM did not 
specify the required period to settle the fund transfer and no provision 



124 

 

for the reversion of unutilized funds and the necessary procedures to be 

observed. 

 

• No contract was submitted for the previous fund transfers made to 
ARMM, thus approving officials may be held accountable for 

unaccounted fund transfers. 

 

Fund Transfers of more than ₱2 billion to PITC for outsourced procurement due for 

reversion/deposit to the National Treasury  

 

20. More than ₱2 billion of funds transferred to PITC in CY 2019 for the 
outsourced procurement, with validity period to utilize already lapsed 

pursuant to the FY 2019 GAA,  as amended by RA No. 11464, FY  2020 GAA, 

were not returned to TESDA nor reverted to the National Treasury, contrary  

NBC No. 578  and  EO 91 series of 2019.   

 

20.1 As of December 31, 2020, the Due from GOCCs – PITC account had a 
balance of ₱3,018,364,708.19 per Accounting Office’s SL. The balance still 

pertains to the fund transfers made in CY 2019 as presented below with

20.2 Section 65 of the General provisions of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 GAA 
states that all appropriations authorized shall be available for release and 

obligation until December 31, 2019. However, with the subsequent 

enactment of RA No. 11464, an Act Extending the Availability of the 2019 

Appropriations to December 31, 2020, in effect had amended Section 65 of 

the General Provisions of RA No. 11260, or the GAA for FY 2019, 

extending the validity of appropriations until December 31, 2020. 

 

20.3 Section 60 of the General Provisions of the 2020 GAA and Item 3.4.5 of the 
National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578 provides that after the end of 

validity period, all unreleased appropriations or unexpended or undisbursed 

funds shall revert to the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund, in 

accordance with Section 28, Chapter 4, Book VI of EO No. 292 and shall 

not be available for expenditure except by subsequent legislative enactment. 

 

20.4 Section 1 of EO 91 series of 2019 provides that all funds transferred between 
or among government agencies and LGUs shall not be considered disbursed 

until the transferred amounts have been actually utilized to pay for goods 

delivered and services rendered, inspected and accepted.  

 

20.5 Moreover, Section 2 of the same EO states that any unreleased 
appropriations and unobligated allotments at the end of the FY, as well as 

unpaid obligations and undisbursed fund at the end of the extended payment 

period (EPP) shall revert to the National Treasury and shall not thereafter 

be available for expenditure, except by subsequent legislative enactment. 

 

20.6 Based on the data provided by the Management, most of the outsourced 
procurements were not undertaken by the PITC. As per report, partial

were awarded and the remaining slots was reported cancelled. 

 

20.7 It was also noted that procurement process of the following  three  (3)

because of Item 3.4.5 of the National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578, 

stating that, after the end of validity period, all unreleased appropriations

20.8 Due to Management’s lack of close monitoring of the funds, more than ₱2  
billion funds with PITC are now due for reversion/deposit with the National 

Treasury due to lapsed validity period to utilize based on the status report 

provided by the Agency. 

 

20.9 We recommended that Management render proper accounting of all 
fund transfers now due for reversion/deposit to the National Treasury 

and to immediately advise the PITC to deposit directly the unutilized 

funds providing TESDA with the necessary documents for recording 

purposes. 

 

20.10 The Management commented that some funds were already 
reverted/returned to the National Treasury and will submit to the Audit 

Team copy of the OR/remittance.

    Retention of utilized fund/savings of ₱356,387,118.82 

 

21. Unauthorized retention of unutilized scholarship funds and trust funds in 
seven ROs amounting to ₱356,387,118.82, which should have been returned 

to the National Treasury exposes these funds to risk of possible 

misappropriation and likewise, deprives the government from utilizing the 

funds for other urgent and priority projects. 

 

In RO IV-B, the amount of ₱21,573,113.93 unutilized CY 2018 UAQTEA-

CHED funds were just reverted to the National Treasury for non-utilization. 

 

21.1 Section 3.1 of DBM and DOF Joint Circular No. 1-97 dated January 2, 
1997 states: “All National Government cash balances, regardless of where 

these are presently deposited or their source of collection, except those 

specifically exempted under Section 2.2 hereof, shall be deposited with the 

National Treasury to maximize the use of scarce resources by minimizing 

government borrowings and rationalizing cash management.” 

 

21.2 Part XI, Sections 8 and 11 of TESDA Circular No. 60, Series of 2018 or 
the Guidelines on the Implementation of Free TVET under the Universal 

Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act (UAQTEA) in State-run 

Technical Vocational Institutions (STVIs) provides that the TESDA RO 

shall return to the TESDA Central Office any unused balance of the funds 

transferred upon completion of the Project and TESDA Central Office shall 

return to CHED-UniFAST any unused balance of the funds transferred or 

proof of remittance to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) upon completion 

of the project. 

 

21.3 TESDA POs/DOs are not allowed to maintain an MDS account, their 
operating requirements are released through subsidy from their respective 

ROs and directly credited to their LCCA account maintained with an 

AGDB. This set-up has exempted the cash subsidies from the coverage of 

the limitations imposed on the utilization and validity of NCA. However, 

such exemption is not absolute since the validity of allotment from where 

the subsidy release was being generated should be strictly observed by the 

DOs when it comes to its availability for utilization. Hence, cash subsidy 

not utilized within the authorized validity period of the allotment from 

which it was sourced should be reverted back to the General Fund or 

returned to the National Treasury. 

 

21.4 Audit of the Cash in Bank -LCCA showed that there were unauthorized 
retentions of unutilized funds in seven TESDA ROs amounting to 

₱356,387,118.82, as discussed below:

incurred in the conduct of various trainings based on the approved QMs  in

RO/OUs Management’s Comments/Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

NCR- DO Manila The Management has taken note of the recommendation and will 

review the cash balance of the DO before reverting the amount. 

NCR-DO PasMak The amount of ₱13,870,780.07 is the estimated unutilized funds for 

2019 and below. In addition, the District requests to allow them to 

fully verify the exact amount for reversion based on the documents 

the office is in possession of. 

CAR- PO Benguet The Management agreed to prepare the documents and remit the 

unused scholarship program funds to the NT. 

II- RO, RTC Management of TESDA-RO justified that they were still in the 

process of liquidating the Trust Fund account. As of September 4, 

2020, they have initially returned to the TESDA-Central Office the 

amount of ₱18,087,916.98 as partial return of unexpended cash in 

the implementation of CY 2018 UAQTEA. 

 

TESDA - RTC has already prepared the BRSs for proper 

reconciliation of the remaining fund which is unutilized and will 

fast-track its completion of needed documents for the immediate 

return of unutilized fund to the TESDA RO.

RO/OUs Management’s Comments/Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

V-POs Albay, 

Camarines Norte, 

Camarines Sur, 

Catanduanes, 

Masbate and 

Sorsogon 

A total of ₱48,115,395.35 was reverted by PO Masbate, Camarines 

Sur and Catanduanes. Copies of DVs and Deposit Slip were 

forwarded to COA on February 17, 2021 (Corresponding to 35% of 

the total amount). The remaining will be reverted and deposited to 

the BTr by PO Albay, Sorsogon and Camarines Norte not later than 

February 24, 2021. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

The amount of ₱48,115,395.35 was deposited on February 17, 2021 

only although the checks were all dated December 29, 2020. 

IV-B The unutilized fund was part of the savings of the institution and 

subject to modification to use it for repair and beautification of the 

school subject to the approval of CHED as the program owner.  

Unfortunately, CHED declined the modification and just wanted to 

return the savings to the National Treasury.  The scholarship slot 

allotted for the UAQTEA 2018 was almost utilized but the fund 

allotted for honorarium, electricity and other utilities as part of the 

capital cost per qualification was not consumed. 

 

   Overall Scholarship Program Budget Utilization and Accomplishment Evaluation 

 

22. The CY 2020 reported total  budget program allocation of ₱8,233,736,000.00 
and the overall utilization and disbursements, which showed favorable results 

do not faithfully represent the actual results of the implementation of 

scholarship training programs considering that a) the reported financial 

performance of  81.62 percent obligations and 73.08 percent disbursements 

does not correspond to the sub-optimal physical accomplishments  of only 

32.96 percent training slots utilized and completed and 46.73 percent targeted 

graduates produced during the  budget year due  to the COVID-19 outbreak; 

b) the obligation rate of 81.62 percent refers to the obligated  fund transfers 

by ROs to the  OUs but  remained unutilized by the latter. 

 

 Moreover, excess approved RQMs over budget allocation was observed in 

TESDA-NCR that resulted in unfunded training courses of ₱59,509,021.97, 

which is inconsistent with the TESDA policy that the budget allocation should 

be based on the approved QMs and thus may lead to unauthorized incurrence 

of obligations. 
 

22.1 To enhance  the Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) 
access and encourage technical education and skills development for the 

needed workers of the key employment generators and emerging industries, 

and in line with the mandate of funding programs and projects for technical 

education and skills development, TESDA offers various major scholarship 

programs such as: a) Training for Work Scholarship Program (TWSP); b) 

Special Training for Employment Program (STEP); c) Private Education 

Student Financial Assistance (PESFA) and d) UAQTEA. 

 



133 

 

22.2 TVET for Global Competitiveness and TVET for Job Readiness are 
addressed by TWSP, which seeks to support rapid, inclusive and sustained 

economic growth through course offerings in priority industries and key 

employment generators. 
 

22.3 While TVET for Social Equity and Poverty Reduction is addressed by 
STEP, a community-based training program that seeks to promote 

employment, through entrepreneurial, self-employment, and service-

oriented activities in the communities. 

 

22.4 PESFA, established through Section 8 of Republic Act No. 8545, otherwise 
known as the Expanded Government Assistance to Students and Teachers 

in Private Education (GASTPE), seeks to extend financial assistance to 

marginalized but deserving students in post-secondary non-degree courses, 

promote TVET, contribute to the development of a competent skilled 

workforce and assist private institutions in their development efforts by 

assuming a steady supply of enrollees to their course offerings. 

 

22.5 UAQTEA, established through Republic Act No. 10931, providing for free 
tuition fee and other schools fees in State Universities and Colleges (SUCs), 

Local Universities and Colleges (LUCs), and state-run Technical 

Vocational Institutions (STVIs), establishing the Tertiary Education 

Subsidy and Student Loan Program (SLP), strengthening the Unified 

Student Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Education (UniFAST), 

and appropriating funds thereof. 

 

22.6 TESDA’s FY 2020 financial accomplishments report per FAR-1 for the 
implementation of the Scholarship Programs indicated a favorable 81.62 

percent obligated budget and 73.08 percent disbursements based on total 

allotments.

22.8 Moreover, the FAR disclosed that out of the total scholarship funds released 
to ROs, 98.04 percent was reported obligated and 82.83 percent, disbursed.  

These data indicate that almost all of the trainings in relation to the 

transferred fund had been conducted and majority had been completed

22.10 As can be observed from the BAR1 Report, the Agency failed to meet its target 
producing only 46.73 percent of the target graduates. The Management justified 

that the implementation of the Scholarship Programs was affected by the pandemic 

causing the suspension of classes of affected TVIs due to the community 

lockdowns enforced by the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging 

Infectious Disease (IATF).   

 

22.11 The inconsistencies of information were due the longtime practice of ROs 
in transferring funds to OUs. Audit revealed that the transfers were 

immediately recorded as disbursements in FAR No. 1 of the ROs, thus the 

report of TESDA yielded an efficient utilization of the budget where in 

reality, most of the transferred funds under the FY 2020 budget were still 

unobligated or unutilized. 

 

22.12 The Audit Team also observed the huge variance in the targeted number of 
graduates as against the total available slots based on the allocated budget, 

as shown below: 
 

Particulars Number % 

No. of slots available based on budget 350,990 100 

No. of Physical Target Graduates 201,500 57 

 

22.13 This information signifies that the allocated budget was not actually based 
on the absorptive capacity of the implementing units that may eventually 

lead to non-utilization of budget. 

 

22.14 While the audit revealed the Agency’s misrepresentation of the information 
presented with regard to physical and financial accomplishments, the sub-

optimal performance in training program implementation can be attributed 

to the limitations of the operational capabilities of TESDA and the TVIs due 

to the pandemic and the series of lockdowns starting the first quarter of CY 

2020. To mitigate the problems in the implementation of scholarship 

brought about by the pandemic, TESDA issued Circulars on guidelines and 

instructions such as implementation of flexible learning modes in the 

delivery of programs by the TVIs and revision of the QMs under the “New 

Normal”.  However, there are also other notable factors that could have 

possibly contributed to the above results, including time constraints to finish 



136 

 

the required reprogramming of training activities due to quarantine 

restrictions. 

 

22.15 Also, it might have been the practice of TESDA as with the other 
government agencies to prepare budget and targets with period of 

implementation exceeding one FY as prior to FY 2018, appropriations have 

two- year period of validity. This had usually resulted in the overlapping 

period of implementation of the current and prior year training programs. If 

the TESDA ROs had prepared its FY 2020 budget in this manner, it is likely 

that the ROs will not be able to implement all scholarship trainings and 

utilized all budget within the target FY. 

 

22.16 As the government is already more inclined to adopt the CBS which 
authorizes the availability for release and disbursement of the appropriation 

only for the current budget year until yearend, TESDA must have started the 

practice of being more prudent and objective in its annual budgeting and 

implementation of its programs and projects. 

 

Excessive release/approval of RQMs had resulted in ₱59 million unfunded 

training courses in TESDA-NCR that may result in unauthorized incurrence of 

obligation. 

 

22.17 In CY 2020, Audit has determined that the approved RQMs of the TESDA 
NCR for TWSP, STEP and PESFA had exceeded the corresponding 

allocated appropriation/allotment for each of the program by 

₱59,509,021.87. Summary of the excessive release/approval is shown in the 

next table:

22.18 Another factor for not achieving the scholarship targets of TESDA is the issuance 
of excessive RQMs from what was originally budgeted as observed in TESDA-

NCR. The additional RQMs increase targets to attain and considering the 

restrictions brought about by the pandemic limiting operational capabilities 

of every sector, this move by the TESDA aggravated the condition and 

impedes the achievement of its targets. For TESDA NCR alone, an 

excessive approved RQMs totaling 14,222 slots with equivalent cost of 

₱59,509,021.97 was noted. 

 

22.19 Taking into consideration that the excess approved issued RQMs were not 
sufficiently funded, there is a risk that the DOs may incur unauthorized 

obligation for lack of funding but may not be noticed because they maintain 

a common fund for all training programs and there are still prior year’s 

unutilized program funds not yet returned to the BTr. 

 

22.20 The Audit Team recommended that Management: 
 

a. stop the ROs’ practice of reporting fund transfer to OUs as 
obligation/utilization, instead, release to OUs should be based on 

actual due and demandable accounts; 

 

b. ensure a more reliable and accurate report of the result of 
program implementation;  

 

c. segregate the Physical Accomplishment as to source of funding; 
and 

 



138 

 

d. monitor and ensure that the approval and release of Regional 
Qualification Maps shall serve as one of the obligational 

authorities of the DOs to incur obligations and must be within the 

limit of the appropriated/allotted fund/budget per program. 

 

23. Deficiencies were observed in the budget utilization for seven Scholarship 
Programs in regions NCR, CAR, l, V and VI pertaining to ₱663,614,352.23 

unutilized budget for unimplemented programs that resulted in a more or less 

31,039 scholarship slots not availed/unenrolled targeted beneficiaries, and 

other gaps that delay the full attainment of the Programs’ objectives.

The unfavorable outcome in the implementation of the 

RO’s CY 2020 Scholarship Program  with low utilization 

and achievement rates  can be attributed to COVID-19 

outbreak, possible delayed response to minimize the 

impact of the pandemic to program implementation, and 

lack of prudence in the planning and budgeting of the CY 

2020 operations due to: (1) delays in the approval and 

issuances of RQMs that led to late implementation of 

training programs by the TVET providers; and the 2 

excessive issuances of RQMs as against the allocated 

appropriation/allotments that resulted in₱59 million 

unfunded training courses in NCR that may result in 

unauthorized incurrence of obligation.

a. instruct DO officers and personnel 
responsible for the preparation of 

yearly Scholarship Allocation Plan 

to revisit and scrutinize the 

absorptive capacities of selected 

eligible TVI’s selecting only those 

programs that the TVIs can execute 

within the target Calendar Year; 

 

b. consider the timing of the release of 
the enacted budget GAA with the 

approval and release of RQMs for 

the early implementation of 

scholarship programs and to adopt 

the guidelines of the CBS in the 

preparation and execution of the 

allocated budget to improve the 

attainment of financial and physical 

targets, and not to be overwhelmed 

with the changes when the CBS shall 

be finally implemented; and 

 

c. monitor and ensure that the 
approval and release of RQMs as 

one of the obligational authorities of 

the DOs to incur obligations and 

should be within the limit of the 

appropriated/allotted fund/budget 

per program. 

Assessment in the Region was suspended 

starting March 12, 2020 until May 2020 and 

for the most part of the year as NCR was 

placed under GCQ. 

 

Based on IATF Resolution 47 s. 2020 dated 

June 1 9, 2020, which was translated into 

guidelines of TESDA through the issuance 

of TESDA Circular 66-A dated June 27, 

2020, only training programs related to 

agriculture/fisheries qualifications for food 

production and processing are allowed to 

resume training regardless of the delivery 

mode including face-to face training. While 

for qualifications in other sectors, only full 

online are allowed and the online component 

of the blended training. Face-to-Face 

training of up to 50% capacity was only 

allowed for those under MGCQ which NCR 

was not classified under since the beginning 

of quarantine imposition last year. 

 

Face-to-face training was only allowed for 

most qualifications under GCQ in May 25, 

2021 through the issuance of TESDA 

Circular 045 s. 2021. 

 

Moreover, in line with policy direction 

provided in the Operational Plan (OPLan) 

TESDA Abot Lahat: TVET Towards the 

'New Normal ' guidelines on the 

implementation of flexible leaning in the 

delivery of technical vocational education 

and training (TVET) was issued, and in 

compliance with the directives of the 

Director-General, the Region has revised its 

FY 2020 RSAP and submitted the initial 

revised FY 2020 RQM to ROMO-SMD on 

June 25, 2020. 

 

CAR-

maximize the utilization of downloaded 

funds for programs intended to uplift 

and improve the lives of targeted 

beneficiaries and to attain its goals in 

providing all Filipinos with an equal 

opportunity to quality tertiary 

education. 

Management justified that said fund was 

from the Commission on Higher Education 

which was transferred to the RO and 

downloaded to the PO purposely for the 

implementation of UAQTE programs. 

However, it was downloaded late in the 4th 

Quarter of 2018; thus, it was not utilized 

during the same year. In 2019, the same 

amount was not utilized due to the 

overlapping of funds. Moreover, they had 

prioritized the implementation of the regular 

fund for UAQTE as per advice from the RO.

V We recommended that Management 

relative to implementation of TWSP, 

STEP, PESFA, UAQTEA, DOTr, 

RCEF, UAQTEA-CHED: 

 

a. optimize the utilization of the funds 
allotted for the training 

needs/activities/requirements of the 

Special Training for Employment 

Program for the benefit of identified 

scholars; 

 

b. review the trainings that are 
identified by TVIs and check the 

actual beneficiaries before approval 

of the QMs; and 

 

c. seek prior clearance from 
sponsoring LGUs to allow walk-in 

clients to fill-in/complete the lacking 

number of trainees from the LGUs 

submitted beneficiaries in order to 

implement the trainings on time. 

 

d. implement during the CY 2021 all 
the programmed trainings in CYs 

2020 and 2021; 

 

e. plan and coordinate efforts to 
engage implementers and stake 

holders to allow a greater number of 

beneficiaries to avail of the benefits 

of the UAQTEA program in order to 

attain the objectives of the program; 

 

f. maximize information 
dissemination to attract the widest 

participation of target beneficiaries; 

and 

 

g. adopt realistic targets to maximize 
the utilization of program funds. 

 

 

The Management commented on the 

following scholarship programs: 

(TWSP, STEP, PESFA, UAQTEA, DOTr, 

RCEF, UAQTEA-CHED) 

 

TWSP: 

Based on the Scholarship Program 

Monitoring Online Reporting (SPMOR) the 

total budget for the 3 TWSP components 

amounting to ₱60,854,610.40,  

₱59.1 million has approved Qualification 

Maps (QMs) corresponding to 4,959 slots. 

Out of the total number of slots, 4,080 

beneficiaries were reported enrolled, thus 

posted 82% Utilization of Slots, this is based 

on the updated Scholarship Program 

Monitoring Online Reporting (SPMOR) as 

of December 31, 2020. 

 

STEP:  

Based on the updated Scholarship Program 

Monitoring Online Reporting (SPMOR), the 

total approved budget for STEP is 

₱95,884,046.58, this amount covers the 

Training Cost, Assessment Fee, Toolkits, 

Allowance, Entrepreneurship & Admin 

Cost.  

 

Of the total budget for 2020 STEP, 

₱49,745,913.20 is covered with approved 

QMs corresponding to 5,098 slots. Out of the 

total number of slots, 3,104 beneficiaries 

were reported enrolled as of December 31, 

2020, thus posted a 61% Utilization of Slots. 

 

UAQTEA: 

 

Based on the updated Scholarship Program 

Monitoring Online Reporting (SPMOR), the 

total approved budget for UAQTEA for CY 

2020 is ₱171,462,445.33. Twenty-four 

percent (24%) of the total budget is allocated 

for the toolkits, while the 76% is for the other 

expense item (₱130,924,509 is covered with

the approved QMs corresponding to 4,824 

slots.) Out of the total number of slots, 2,686 

or 56% beneficiaries were reported enrolled 

as of December 31, 2020, thus posted a 56% 

Utilization of Slots. 

 

Also, the Management justified that 

Scholarship Programs in 2020 was greatly 

affected by the COVID-19 pandemic which 

is one of the reasons for the non-attainment 

of 100% Utilization of 2020 TWSP 

Allocation.    

 

RESP: 

Based on the SPMOR on 2020 RESP, the 

total budget of RESP for CY 2020 is 

₱39,124,010.80, with a corresponding 3,276 

number of slots/beneficiaries. Out of the 

total number of slots, 2,828 beneficiaries or 

86% of the total slots were reported enrolled 

as of December 31, 2020. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

The reported increase in accomplishment 

cannot be validated by the Auditor because 

what was submitted on February 19, 2021 

was plain Management Comment to Audit 

Observation Memorandum without any 

attached verifiable reports to document the 

reported increase in accomplishment. 

 

DOTr: 

Clarity as to the implementation of DOTr 

scholarship shall be made available after the 

scheduled reconciliation of the utilization of 

2019 DOTr. The recommendations of the 

Auditor are noted as earlier indicated. 

 

UAQTEA-CHED: 

The Management commented that they will 
issue a memo directing specific State-run 

TVIs in Region V to submit all liquidation 

reports and revert the unutilized Cash 

balance to the Regional Office. 

 

We recommended that Management 

make proper representation with 

TESDA Central Office on the timely 

release of SAROs for all scholarship 

programs in order to be able to fully 

implement the scheduled trainings and 

fully utilize the allotted budget. 

The Management commented that The 

SAROs for the RESP were released in 

November and December. These late 

releases were compounded by Memo 14 

series 2021 defining the validity of said 

funds until December 31, 2020. 

 

Such late releases were due to the following:  

 

a. All previously approved QMs (July 
2020) were revised per directive of the

Management Comment and Auditor’s 

Rejoinder 

Central Office in consideration of the 

availability of funds for the scholarship 

program, and 

 

b. revision of appropriate qualifications 
related to rice production. 

 

We recommended that Management 

follow strictly the guidelines on 

providing toolkits to learners and should 

release the toolkits within the prescribed 

timeframe. 

The Management commented that TESDA 

Central Office has issued an Official 

Statement regarding the Status of 

Procurement of Toolkits both for STEP and 

UAQTEA for CY 2018. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

The copy of the press statement issued by 

TESDA Central Office and copy of Letter of 

Sec. Lapeña allegedly attached as Annex A 

and B, respectively, to the Management 

Comment were not yet received by COA. 

 

VI- 

DVTS 

We recommended the Management to: 

a. coordinate with TESDA Central 
Office and or Regional Office on 

programs/trainings to be conducted 

by the school so as to avoid the same 

scenario of not maximizing funds 

allocated; and 

 

b. optimize the utilization of funds 
allotted for programs/trainings 

within the provided time frame. 

The Management commented that they will 
see to it that all programs/trainings shall be 

properly coordinated with TESDA Central 

and ROs in order to maximize the fund 

allocation and shall implement the training 

on time and will fully utilize the funds 

allotted.  

 

24. Unfavorable outcomes in the implementation of Scholarship Programs in CO 
and 12  ROs such as: a) non-procurement/late procurement of toolkits for 

CYs 2018, 2019 and 2020  STEP and UAQTEA Programs resulted in non-

provision of  toolkits to scholars b) National Certificate for Driving for 3,719 

graduates not recognized by the Land Transportation Office (LTO); and  c) 

late releases/unpaid Allowances or Training Benefits totaling ₱45,434,568.70  

and  other deficiencies hinder the attainment of the overall objective of the 

Scholarship Programs.   

 
Table 41: Deficiencies Observed in the Scholarship Programs Implementation 

Region Observations 

Non-Procurement/ and Late/Non-Distribution of Toolkits 

Central Office Delayed/non-procurement of starter toolkits for the STEP and UAQTEA 

scholars is still not addressed despite Management’s recourse to outsource 

the procurement to the Philippine International Trading Corporation 

(PITC). The unresolved issues on procurement had resulted in non-

distribution of toolkits due to non-availability of scholars/claimant and the 

inability to trace and locate them after the training, or non-provision due to 

reversion of the allotted budget amounting to ₱821,208,436.76, thereby 

depriving the beneficiary scholars of the guaranteed program benefits and

opportunity to engage into livelihood project/activities with the help of the 

toolkits supposed to be provided during the training. 

 

Moreover, the remaining amount transferred to PITC for the nine (9) lots 

of CY 2019 STEP program funds, which were also part of the cancelled 

procurements should be accounted and reverted to the National Treasury. 

 

V Toolkits amounting to ₱4.5 million intended for 924 graduates of STEP for 

CYs 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 were not released to the identified 

beneficiaries and remained idle and unutilized at the storage facility of 

TESDA Region V, thus defeating the purpose of the program of providing 

equipment for immediate job/work for trainees/graduates. 

 

Likewise, Starter Toolkits were not given to the 9,225 reported 

learners/graduates of CY 2018 UAQTEA-CHED-UniFAST program, 

contrary to TESDA Circular No. 60 Series of 2018; thus the 9,225 

learners/graduates were not able to use the toolkits for self-employment and 

gainful activities. 

 

VI- 

Antique PO 

601 toolkits totaling ₱4.276 million for CY 2020 STEP trainings were still 

not received and distributed from the Central Office (CO) thru the Regional

trainings remained unclaimed/undistributed in the Provincial Training 

Center – Antique, contrary to TESDA Circular No. 011, series of 2020

attainment of the Program’s objective. 

XIII 5,197 starter toolkits under the CY 2019 Skills Training for Employment 

Program (STEP) totaling ₱14,636,846.34 were not yet distributed to the 

intended scholars/graduates, hence the objective of the program was not

NOPO 

All 30 trainings under approved Qualifications for the Calendar Year 2020 

of Passi Trade School (PTS) were not conducted within ten 10 calendar 

days from indicative date of the Start of the Training Program identified in 

the Qualification Map (QM) as per targeted training dates, contrary to 

TESDA Circular No. 1 series of 2020 or the Omnibus Guidelines for 

TESDA Scholarship Programs. This delay will compromise their 

corresponding scholarship allocation/s. 

TVIs granted with 306 scholarship slots in amount of ₱3,757,200.00 were 

not able to commence within 10 days from the indicative start of training, 

contrary to Item VI(C)(5) of TESDA Circular No.  Series of 2020 thus, 

depriving the intended beneficiaries of the maximum benefit that may have 

been derived from the said program. 

V Management has no adequate monitoring system on the graduates of the 

Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) program to 

determine the status of employment after completing the training, hence the 

correctness of the reported employment rate of 11.25 percent of the total 

graduates numbering around 18,732 under the TWSP could not be verified 

and relied upon due to insufficient and incomplete data. 

VIII- 

RO, Leyte PO 

Due to the delayed implementation of the 2020 STEP by TESDA RTC, 

only 45 enrollees or 24.45% were reported as employed as of December 31, 

2020, thus depriving the intended beneficiaries the possibility for 

immediate employment and other benefits they could get under the 

program. 

IX Effective and efficient implementation of the Scholarship Training 

Programs, namely, STEP, TWSP and Private Education Student Financial 

Assistance (PESFA) was affected by the following lapses: a) reported low 

absorption employment rate far below the target employment rate for CY 

2019; b) absorption/employment rate of graduates for CY 2020 could not 

be ascertained due to the inability of TESDA to monitor/measure the factual 

employment absorption of the graduate scholars; and c) non-observance of 

the required mandatory assessment upon completion of the training which 

are not in keeping with the objective of the training program.

TESDA ISAT 

Instructional materials allowance of TESDA-ISAT amounting to 

₱3,165,000.00 were not distributed to scholars under the Free TVET 

Program, within the prescribed period due to the delay in the transfer of 

fund from TESDA Regional Office No. 02, which forfeits its intended 

purpose, contrary to Part V, Section 2 of TESDA Circular No. 60, series of 

2018. Likewise, available funds to cover said allowances amounted only to 

₱2,852,300.54, which resulted in the deficit of ₱312,699.46 caused by 

mishandling of funds, contrary to Section 4 of PD No. 1445.

number of 187 days delay in the distribution thereof.  

 

Consequently, ₱49,080.00 remained unclaimed and ₱179,560.00 became 

stale and was cancelled due to unavailability of the Community Training

pertinent TESDA prescribed guidelines, thus defeating the purpose of the 

grant of the said allowance and deprived the beneficiaries of the opportunity 

to make themselves productive and employable the earliest possible time.

Management’s Comments: 

 

Management justified that based on TESDA’s Training Regulation in DRIVING 

NC II, the 120-hour training consists of competencies that a person must achieve 

to operate light motor vehicles classified under LTO Restriction code 1 and 2.  

 

The disbursed amount cannot be considered as wasted since the training program 

has benefitted the trainees and has equipped them with appropriate skills that will 

enable them to become a professional driver or light vehicle driver.  

 

The Management also stated that TESDA has just signed a MOA with LTO on 

March 12, 2021 to address the cited issues and concerns regarding the non-

recognition by LTO of TESDA’s National Certificate in Driving NC II in relation 

to the trainee’s application for issuance of a Student Drivers’ Permit.

The Management commented that the schedule of training is always prepared prior 

to the start of training, however, there are some factors that are beyond their control 

including the COVID-19 pandemic wherein some areas were subjected to 

lockdowns which affects the schedule of the trainings.

immediate implementation of programs during the year; and  

 

c. submit to the Audit Team the approved QM for each Qualification Title 
containing the available training slots, for evaluation if the maximum 

capacity was utilized. 

 

Management’s Comments: 

 

Management commented that they will monitor the implementation of the STEP 

and the employment of the trainees. 

We recommended that the Management exercise due diligence in monitoring 

the training programs to ensure the attendance of enrollees and compliance 

with the required training duration for an effective implementation of the 

TWSP. Moreover, proportionate reduction from the training cost equivalent 

to eight hours should be made. 

 

Management’s Comments: 

 

The Management commented that they will observe strict compliance with the 

Omnibus Guidelines. 

IX That Management:

c. conduct close monitoring of employment reports by training 
partners/providers to measure the factual employment/absorption rate of 

graduates; and 

 

d. strictly require the conduct of mandatory assessment of 
scholars/graduates to ensure their chances of employment. 

 

Management’s Comments: 

 

Management commented that under the New Normal, the accomplishment report 

on the number of scholarship graduates is at 96%. This does not yet include all 

those who are yet to graduate in January 2021. All Scholarship slots were 100% 

deployed. On the other hand, the low accomplishment of employment of scholars 

shows the effect of the new normal situation, however, they are advocating for 

entrepreneurial activity to promote self-employment to scholars.

Region 

 
Recommendations 

Recommendations are all noted. Closely monitoring of employment reports by the 

TVI/TTI is now being done to measure the factual employment/absorption rate of 

graduates. Mandatory assessment for all qualifications with assessment tool is

actual site inspection is conducted after verification of completeness and 

correctness of documentary evidences submitted by the applicant training provider. 

Subsequently, after one year of issuance of CTPR, and every two years thereafter, 

the same program is subjected to a mandatory compliance audit to establish 

continuous compliance to standards.

Management’s Comments: 

 

Management of TESDA-Cagayan PO explained that all checks were issued and 

released with the assistance of our Community Training and Employment 

Coordinators (CTECs) and Technical Vocational Institutions (TVIs) but the payees 

were not able to transact with the bank and due to the COVID-19 pandemic that 

these checks remain outstanding. 

 

Management assured that the Scholarship focal and Accountant will instruct the 

TVIs to submit on time the weekly attendance reports of scholars to ensure prompt

Management to: 

 

a. make an effort to contact the scholars/beneficiaries who have 
unclaimed/unreleased allowances and devise a convenient way of 

releasing the allowances due them.  

 

b. promptly release the Living Allowances of scholars/beneficiaries during 
the duration of the training and at the training sites. 

 

c. be diligent enough in the prompt release of any allowances due to the 
beneficiaries.  

 

Management’s Comments: 

 

The Management explained that the timely distribution /releasing of allowances 

remained as a challenge to TESDA-NOPO given the limited plantilla positions 

with only one regular personnel heading the scholarship section with Contract of 

Service Staffs to help in the implementation of the various scholarship programs. 

 

Further, the Management explained various reasons which contributed to the delay 

of the distribution/releasing of trainee’s benefits specially of the prior year’s such 

as the approval of the DVs by the Director General which took several months to 

be returned to the POs, delayed submission of documents by training providers, 

limited personnel, and learners are no longer be contacted.  

 

Also, Management already started posting in their Facebook official page the list 

of learners who were not able to claim their allowances for the trainings conducted 

in CY 2017-2020. Management also intends to send the list of learners to the 

respective training providers and request them to post in their official social media 

account/page in the hope to reach these scholars. 

 

Finally, Management conveyed that for CY 2020 scholarship allocations, there 

were only minimal unclaimed allowances because portion of the 

allowances/benefits of the learners were released while the program is still ongoing 

and the remaining 50% immediately after the completion of the training program.  

 

Management assured the Commission that they are continually enhancing their 

monitoring mechanism to ensure the observance of the timelines on the distribution 

of the allowances to the learners in the trainings being conducted regardless of the 

type of scholarship. 

IX-

avoid inappropriate disbursement of government funds; and

Region 

 
Recommendations 

 

b. follow-up from the TESDA Central Office for the speedy delivery of 
toolkits intended for the 636 graduates and for the upcoming graduates of 

the ongoing-programs. 

 

Management’s Comments: 

 

Management justifies that the cited book allowance refers to the 2018 UAQTEA 

Program. Book allowance will be released by the TVI to the eligible learners thru 

payroll and will be liquidated by the learners by providing ORs, as proof of 

instructional materials purchases, to the TVI. Non-availability of books in the local 

market for other qualifications for UAQTEA 2018 delays the release of its book 

allowance.  

 

Central Office has issued a Memorandum No. 038 series of 2020 dated January 27, 

2020 regarding the updates on the status of procurement of starter toolkits for STEP 

and UAQTEA scholarships for 2018 and 2019. Based on the memorandum, the 

procurement of these toolkits is still pending at the Central Office. No further 

updates were given to us till this date.  

 

The Management assured that they will still be coordinating with the focal persons 

of TESDA Central Office regarding the status and availability of UAQTEA starter 

toolkits. As soon as the toolkits are available, it will be distributed immediately to 

the beneficiaries of the UAQTEA Program. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

The delayed releases of Instructional Materials Allowance, mostly given after the 

training, defeats its intended purpose as specified in the UAQTEA training 

guidelines. The tendency is for the graduates to spend the money received on other 

purposes since the purchase of learning materials are no longer a necessity after 

the training. 

II-

transactions, to ascertain validity, accuracy and completeness, particularly 

the unsubmitted DVs and the necessary supporting documents in the 14 ROs 

totaling ₱757,531,623.35.  

 

25.1 Audit revealed that various financial records, reports and their supporting 
documents were not submitted to the Audit Teams within the prescribed 

reglementary period for audit review while there were reports submitted but 

incurred significant delays, thus precluding the timely review/evaluation of 

the records/reports, which cast doubts on the propriety and validity of 

transactions. Likewise, laxity in the control was also noted due to non-

maintenance of required financial records that affect the accuracy and 

reliability of financial reports.

25.4 As observed, non-submission of DVs is a common and recurring problem 
or deficiency in almost all POs/DOs of TESDA nationwide, and it usually 

involved millions of disbursements or uses of government funds.  

Apparently, this problem has not been properly addressed as the deficiencies 

exist despite issuance of Notice of Suspension. As also observed, instead of 

imposing the appropriate sanctions provided by law the concerned officers 

in some instances were just transferred or assigned to other position or 

office. 

 

b. Non-submission of other financial reports and records 
 

Eight ROs failed to submit the monthly, quarterly and year-end financial reports 

and records, which prevented the timely verification/assessment of the reports to 

ascertain their accuracy and validity and early detection of errors to effect 

immediate adjustment.

25.8 We recommended that the TESDA CO and concerned OUs and ROs, I, 
II, III, IV-A, IV-B, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, NCR and CARAGA: 

 

• direct the Accountant/Disbursing Officer/Financial Analyst and/or 
AO to submit immediately all the DVs and their supporting 

documents to the Audit Team to determine the validity, propriety 

and legality of the transactions; and to prepare, maintain and 

submit immediately all the required financial, budgetary and other 

reports and records and their supporting documents to the Audit 

Team to properly determine their accuracy, validity and to effect 

immediate adjustments for any errors, if necessary; 

 

• take appropriate administrative disciplinary action against 
concerned personnel for repeated unjustified failure to comply with 

the requirements on the submission of DVs, which omission 

constitutes neglect of duty pursuant to Section 122 of PD No. 1445; 

and 

 

• Consider the suspension of salaries of the officers and employees 
responsible for the deficiencies observed. 

  

25.9 The following are the Management’s Comments on the Audit 
Recommendations. 

 
ROs OUs Management’s Comment: 

NCR CaMaNaVa The Management commented that it had issued a 

Memorandum to the concerned officers and staffs to 

strictly comply with all the recommendations. That the 

designated Financial Analyst is on maternal leave 

effective May 3, 2021 and replaced by a new employee, 

assisted by two Job Orders. That some of the required 

reports for submission to COA have already been 

readied, however, the photocopying process delayed the 

DO’s preparation of copies of the documents as the DO 

does not want to gamble on having the documents 

photocopied outside to avoid missing documents. 

Manila The Management commented that they have taken note 

of the recommendations and will ensure that no clearance 



175 

 

ROs OUs Management’s Comment: 

shall be issued to outgoing personnel unless all required 

reports and all other accountabilities were properly 

turned over. 

 

Office Memorandums were also issued to the concerned 

employees to expedite the submission of required 

reports. The Management commented that out of the 170 

unsubmitted vouchers, 139 were already submitted to the 

Audit Team amounting to ₱1,008,016.96. 

II Cagayan PO 

 

 

 

 

Multitasks assigned to all staff including the 

Accountant/Financial Analyst and the funds maintained 

by the office such as Fund 101-Regular, Scholar Funds – 

TWSP, PESFA, UAQTEA, STEP, RESP and Sariling 

Sikap Program Fund, as well as the limited manpower 

complement in the PO, hinder the prompt submission of 

the DVs to the Auditor’s Office. Nevertheless, the 

Management conveyed their intent to adhere to the 

recommendations 

III Pampanga Required the responsible officials to strictly comply with 

the prescribed period of submission of DVs and 

supporting documents. 

Zambales Promised to submit the DVs and its supporting 

documents. 

Aurora Requested for 15 working days extension to fully comply 

the said observation. 

RO Agreed to comply with the submission of required 

documents and to follow strictly and regularly the 

provision of Section 361 of the GAAM. 

Bulacan, Nueva 

Ecija 

PTC Calumpit agreed to comply with the 

recommendations during the Exit Conference. 

GPSAT Agreed and assured to implement the recommendations. 

IV-A PO Cavite Many scholars were unable to pick up the checks in the 

office despite all calls and messages to their respective 

TVIs. Unclaimed checks, together with the unpaid DVs, 

remained in the custody of TESDA PO-Cavite until such 

time that these are released to payees. 

 

Delays in the submission of reports resulted from bulk of 

workloads of employee who performs all the duties and 

responsibilities in the Accounting and Budget Units 

considering that the PO is a large one. The Provincial 

Director assured that best efforts will be exerted to 

submit all required reports to Audit Team on time. 

PO Laguna Assured compliance with the audit recommendation. But 

the officer concerned commented that due to the 

voluminous work assigned to her, she could not cope 

with the timely preparation and submission of financial 

reports.  

PTESDC-Taytay Required the concerned personnel to: a) transmit the 

unsubmitted DVs with complete supporting documents 

to the Audit Team; and b) strictly comply with the rules 

and regulations in the regular submission of the monthly, 



176 

 

ROs OUs Management’s Comment: 

quarterly and year-end reports with complete supporting 

documents. 

IV-A RO, Taguig To submit the FSs, Trial Balance and their supporting 

schedules on March 5, 2021. Delay was caused by lack 

of manpower but Management is continuously exerting 

efforts in improving and implementing controls to 

expedite the preparation of the necessary reports and 

timely submission to the COA.  
 PTC Rosario The Acting FA committed to comply with the audit 

recommendation this CY 2021. 
 JZGMSAT The Senior Bookkeeper/Acting FA commented that she 

had prepared all the reports as stipulated on her duties 

and function and is aware of the schedule of submission 

of reports, however, due to voluminous work, she was 

not able to submit on time the year-end FSs. 
 PO Rizal Delayed submission was due to late transmittal of Bank 

Statement by the Bank Post Office. The Financial 

Analyst was not also able to meet the deadline of 

submission of FSs for the PO since she is also handling 

the preparation of reports of the PTESDC-Taytay as her 

concurrent designation. 
 RPTESDC 

Binangonan 

Directed the Financial Analyst to prepare and submit the 

BRS and FS within the prescribed period and to see to it 

that all reports were prepared for all funds. Rest assured 

that all reports will be submitted on time. 
 RPTESDC Cainta Directed the Acting Financial Analyst to: a) Submit the 

FSs and their supporting documents, BRSs from January 

to December 2020, which were already submitted to the 

Audit Team on February 10, 2021; b) Maintain records 

on the date of receipt of Bank Statements; and c) Strictly 

comply with the deadlines pertinent to the submission of 

reports as provided in Sections 5 and 7 of Chapter 21 of 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 
 BPTI Amenable to said lapses as they claimed to have been 

affected by the lack of transportation brought about by 

the COVID-19 pandemic. They, however, promised to 

abide by the rules on the regular and timely submission 

this ensuing year. 
 QNAS Amenable with their lapses and promised to exert efforts 

in the ensuing year to meet submission of the financial 

reports within the required deadlines.  

IV-B Palawan PO, 

Marinduque PO, 

BSAT, TPSAT and 

ROMMTAC 

Directors of Palawan and Marinduque, and School 

Administrators of BSAT, TPSAT and ROMMTAC, 

during the Exit Conference, acknowledged the audit 

observations and recommendations of the Auditors; and 

assured the Audit Teams to submit documents supporting 

the payment of various expenses. The Management of 

TESDA PO-Marinduque added that the requirements 

under TESDA Circular No. 62 s. 2020 dated May 19, 



177 

 

ROs OUs Management’s Comment: 

2020 are voluminous and could not be attached 

immediately to the payroll. 

SSVTC Mentioned that they have limited staff in the 

Administrative and Accounting Units.  Due to 

voluminous works, payments and other claims were not 

almost carefully examined.  The Management shall make 

the necessary adjustments and measures to settle these 

issues.

within the prescribed period in compliance with the audit 

recommendation. 
V PTC Malilipot Failure to submit the DVs and supporting documents 

within the prescribed period was due to the pandemic but  

Management will abide by the recommendation of COA 

to direct the Financial Analyst to submit immediately the 

DVs and supporting documents within the prescribed 

period. Likewise, failure to prepare and submit the BRSs 

within the prescribed period was also due to the

PTC Guinobatan Observation and recommendation duly noted and for 

compliance and will submit on February 16, 2021. 

SFIST DVs and its supporting documents were submitted in

PO Cam Norte Will submit the necessary documents and ensure that 

disbursements are supported with complete documents 

and bear the approval of the proper officials. 

 

The Management acknowledged the delay in submission 

and explained that due to voluminous work load, lack of

PO Albay Explained that submission of financial reports and 

monthly BRS was delayed due to the Community 

Quarantine. In addition, this was inadvertently missed 

due to the voluminous workload of the FA. Henceforth, 

this shall be given preferential attention. 

RTC Pili The submission of Financial Reports and BRS is the 

concern of TESDA Regional Office Accountant. 

RPSI Justified that the delay in the preparation and submission 

of documents was due to manpower constraint.  

VII Cebu PO Since January 2021, they are now implementing the 

preparation of DVs in three (3) copies and the latest 

available DVs to be submitted to the Office of the

RTC Issued Office Order to the employees concerned to 

render overtime services including Saturdays in the 

preparation of the documents and fast-track its 

submission.  

VIII Samar PO The FA was already instructed to submit the unsubmitted

ROs OUs Management’s Comment: 

PTC The Management assured to submit the lacking pertinent 

documents. 

LNAIS The FA explained that incurrence of delay was due to the 

pandemic and the lack of manpower in the Accounting 

Unit. However, she assured to try her best in complying 

with the recommendations. 

CNVS The Management agreed with the audit recommendation. 

BNAS The Management of TESDA ESPO and BNAS agreed 

with the audit recommendation. 
IX RO, RTC TESDA RO IX and RTC had instructed the Cashier to

they will strictly adhere and advice the concerned AOs to 

submit pertaining DVS and required financial reports 

according to its prescribed mandated timelines.  

ZSPI 

ZDS TESDA PO ZDS explained that the delay of submission 

was due to the work arrangement where personnel were 

not physically present and were working from home due 

to restrictions on COVID-19 quarantine protocol. Hence, 

the Management has issued a Memorandum to the FA to 

comply with the recommendation to submit to COA the 

remaining paid DVs and their supporting documents on 

or before February 28, 2021. 

ZDN The Management of TESDA PO ZDN has already issued

late submission of various reports because of being 

understaffed and the effect of the COVID -19 that 

restricted everyone to work regularly in the office.  But 

she assured that she will look for a way to submit their 

reports promptly. 

PO Misamis 

Oriental 

Management seek consideration and understanding for 

the following reasons: 

 

• TESDA Misamis Oriental is classified as a large 
province and has many transactions, especially 

scholarship programs. 

• Large volume of transactions for year-
end/closing of transactions  

• Delayed approval of Scholarship Qualification 
Maps 



180 

 

ROs OUs Management’s Comment: 

• Delayed downloading of funds 
 

The Disbursing Officer and Collecting Officer is  only 

one person.  All scholarship programs have training 

allowances for the beneficiaries and as the yearend 

approaches, the bulk of disbursements has significantly 

increased. 

RTC-Ilagan City The Administrator justified that because of the 

implementation of ECQ for COVID-19 prevention and 

the understaffed condition had resulted to the usual 

incidence of delayed submission of various financial 

reports.  

PTC Bukidnon DVs and their supporting documents consisting of 2 

folders were prepared and submitted before the deadline 

but it turned out that one of the folders was labeled 

“PTC’s Copy” instead of “COA’s Copy”. Indeed, there 

was a lapse of communication between the FA and the 

staff who did the labeling.  

CSAT Commented that the recommendation of COA was well 

taken.  

XI RO Delay of submission was due to the pandemic and will 

immediately submit the required supporting documents 

on or before February 5, 2021. 

 RTC-KPVTC The Management agreed with the recommendations and

of Land Bank of the Philippines so that they can immediately access 

the on-time, real time bank balances of the account on specific date, 

and for the Agency to immediately prepare the BRS on a timely basis. 

 

Based on records, it was almost every year that the Agencies failed to 

submit their year-end FSs on time. The Audit Team, however, will 

monitor the regular submission of the reports to ensure the Agency’s 

compliance with the recommendations.

Audit Team. 

 

Failure to maintain the required financial reports and records and non-disclosure of 

relevant information

accounts could not be ascertained. 

II API Records of the AO such as Petty Cash Fund Record and Cash 

Disbursements Record (CDRec) were not regularly updated 

due to multiple funds and accounts handled by the AO,

accuracy of the balance of said fund for a given period. 

BPTI The Accounting Office of Bondoc Peninsula Technological 

Institute (BPTI) and Quezon National Agricultural School

of the Agency. 

CARAGA NMSF GLs and SLs of NMSF were not prepared for all accounts as 

required in Section 12, Chapter 2, Volume I and Volume II of

Regions OUs Management’s Comment 

VII RTC 7 Management commented that Memorandum No. 67 series of 2021 dated 

February 10, 2021 was issued to the Acting Regional Accountant directing 

him to expedite the updating of the GLs. The GLs have been duly updated 

and submitted to the Office of the Auditor on February 8, 2021 via email. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

 

The Team would like to emphasize that these GLs should be 

maintained/updated as often as posting entries in the journals. Updating of 

GLs is not only performed at the end of the year, otherwise it will not serve 

its purpose in the monthly preparation of Trial Balances. 

IX SDO According to Management, all SDOs were already required to maintain 

CDRec. As of now, all SDO are maintaining a cash book/CDRec to record 

their corresponding cash advances, disbursements made/utilization, 

refunds, adjustments, if any. 

RO Management explained that the SCO now prepares and maintains the 

CRRec for collections and deposits of SSP and Fund 101 Treasury Account. 

Proper footing for every page of the records is being done to determine 

correct totals. 

 

Management of TESDA RO IX commented that CkADADRec maintained 

by the AO is now being monitored and reconciled by the accounting unit to 

ensure completeness and accuracy of records. Monthly monitoring of Cash 

in Bank Balances is also being done to reconcile any adjustments affecting 

it. 

ZPSI Management of ZPSI affirmed that they will strictly adhere to the 

recommendation requiring the AO and Accountant to coordinate all 

information/adjustments that affects the Cash in Bank account. 

X PO Lanao 

del Norte 

The newly assumed FA of TESDA PO Lanao del Norte assured that he will 

try his best that this practice will not occur again. 

RTC Iligan The FA of TESDA RTC Iligan explained that she is maintaining SL but she 

failed to update because of the effect of the implementation of the 

community quarantine for the 1st and 2nd quarters of 2020 where in regular 

reporting of employee was restricted and she has no ample time to update 

the SL of each account.  The Administrator make clear that their Agency 

will experience pathetic condition of reporting by this year because of the 

effect of reshuffling of personnel in the TESDA. Some of their personnel 

like the FA herself received reassignment Order that she will be assigned to 

other areas. 

XI  The Accountant will submit the updated GLs to the COA Office by 

February 23 or 24, 2021. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder:

recommendations. 

PTC Mintal Management will comply with the said recommendation. The Regional 

Accountant will require all Disbursing Officers to submit said report 

starting this year. Management has noted the recommendation.

recommendations.

Irregular, Unnecessary, Excessive, Extravagant and Unconscionable Expenditures 

(IUEEU) Uses of Government Funds 

 

27. Disbursements in the amount of ₱121,107,832.85 were irregular, excessive and 
unnecessary due to nonconformity with existing government rules and 

regulations and deviation or non-observance of applicable criteria/standard 

of necessity in the incurrence of expenditures or uses of government funds, 

contrary to Section 1 of Administrative Order (AO) No. 6, s. 2017 and COA 

Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, thus cast doubts on the validity 

and propriety of the expenditures.  

 

27.1 COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, defined irregular, 
unnecessary, excessive or extravagant expenditures or funds, whereas 

Section 33 of PD 1445, on the other hand, stressed the role of the 

Commission in the prevention and its power to disallow such expenditures. 

 

27.2 Section 1 of Administrative Order (AO) No. 6, s. 2017 stated that, 
notwithstanding the repeal of AO No. 103, s. 2004, existing laws, rules and 

regulations mandating the judicious and prudent use of government funds 

shall remain in full force and effect, and all agencies and instrumentalities 

shall continue to ensure that no irregular, unnecessary, extravagant, 

excessive and unconscionable expenses shall be incurred by the 

government. 

 

27.3 Post-audit of TESDA CO and ROs financial transactions revealed several 
deficiencies with regard to proper observance or adherence to pertinent 

laws, rules and regulations in the disbursements and uses of government 

funds and proper documentation to establish their propriety and validity, 

thus resulted to incurrence of irregular, excessive and unnecessary 

expenditures amounting to ₱77,067,176.83 as discussed in the next 

succeeding paragraphs: 
 

a. Irregular hiring of personnel through Job Order (JO) Contract 
 

27.4 A total of P64,957,560.47 was expended for the services and other

individual daily rate ranging from P600.00 to P2,500.00, inclusive of the 

20% premium, which were not in accordance with CSC-COA-DBM 

Joint Circular No. 1, series of 2017. 

 

27.5 Verification from the payments made through Cash-MDS account of

27.7 CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, series of 2017 provides conditions 
and limitations in hiring JO workers, to wit: 

 

6.3.1   The services of a job order worker is either paid according to an 

agreed contract amount for the piece of work or on a daily wage 

basis. 

 

6.3.2   Contracting the services of job order workers shall be subject to 

pertinent budgeting, accounting and auditing rules and 

regulations. 



189 

 

 

 7.2   Hiring of Job Order workers shall be limited to emergency or  

intermittent work, such as clearing of debris on the roads, canals, 

waterways, etc. after natural/ man-made disasters/occurrences; 

other trades and crafts, and manual tasks such as carpentry, 

plumbing, painting, electrical, and the like which are not part of 

the regular functions of the agency. 

 

7.2        Contract of service and job order workers should not, in any case, 

be made to perform functions which are part of the job description 

of the agency's existing regular employees.   

 

7.3   Contract of service and job order workers should not be designated 

to positions exercising control or supervision over regular and 

career employees.  

 

7.4      The services of the contract of service and job order workers are not 

covered by Civil Service law and rules thus, not creditable as 

government service. They do not enjoy the benefits enjoyed by 

government employees, such as leave, PERA, RATA and thirteenth 

month pay. 

 

9.0    Individuals hired through job order shall be paid wages equivalent 

to the daily wage/salary of comparable positions in government 

and a premium of up to 20% of such wage/salary. (Emphasis ours) 
 

27.8 The Audit Team noted that the rates ranged from P660.00 to P2,500.00, and 
the highest rate of P2,500.00 pertains to some JOs hired as Senior Technical 

Assistant, Technical Staff and Senior Architect. However, the Audit Team 

was not provided with guidelines or standard that sets the amount of salaries 

per position together with the Job Description or Terms of Reference (ToR) 

to determine whether the salaries given are equitable and it commensurate 

with the work actually performed and the required qualifications of the 

position. 

 

27.9 Initial review conducted disclosed that the daily/monthly rates of some JOs 
personnel are higher than the authorized rates of similar or comparable 

regular positions in government. Some of these items are as follows:

27.10 Aside from the identified positions mentioned in the table above, there were 
also various positions provided with higher rates in CY 2020. Moreover, 

inconsistencies were also observed in the grant of salary rates as several JO 

contracts that disclosed similar or the same positions were not provided with 

the same rates.  

 

27.11 It was further observed that wages had significantly increased because the 
20% premium were provided every renewal of contract which is not in 

accordance with Section 9 of the aforementioned Joint Circular, where it is 

clearly provided that the premium shall be up to 20 percent of the daily 

wage/salary of comparable positions in government.  

 

27.12 The unregulated hiring of JOs and non-compliance with governing rules and 
regulations had caused the government to incur unnecessary/irregular 

expenses. 

 

27.13 We recommended that Management of TESDA CO: 
 

a. provide guidelines/standardized TOR for each JO item/position; 
 

b. provide basis for the daily rates/wages given to JO personnel; 
and 

 

c. refrain from granting daily wage/salary not in accordance with 
CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, series of 2017, any 

excess/unauthorized payment is disallowable in audit. 

 

27.14 Management Comments are as follows: 
 

• The hiring of job order personnel of the Agency is in accordance 
with CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1 series of 2017. 

 

• The conditions stated in the contract of service of JO employee 
ensure the necessity of the work to be done and a guaranty that no 

existing regular employee can perform the job. 

 

• The Management is acknowledging the findings of COA on 
setting the standard rate of salaries per position; in line with this, 

the Human Resource Management Division (HRMD) is currently 

on the process of drafting the guidelines and policies to 

standardize the salaries of the job order personnel. 



191 

 

 

• The Management engaged the service of JO workers to ensure the 
continuous and efficient delivery of government programs and 

services, such as in the implementation of projects requiring 

personnel with skills or expertise not available in the Agency. 

 

• The Management assures the Audit Team that the observations 
and recommendations would be considered and harmonized in 

the review of the Agency’s functions, systems, and procedures, 

organizational structure and staffing to determine the appropriate 

manpower complement for its programs/ activities/projects. 

 

b. Undetermined necessity of number of attendees to international 
meetings/conference 

 

27.15 TESDA had incurred ₱4,351,223.04 travelling expenses exclusive of 
plane fare in attending two (2) international meetings/conferences held 

in Singapore with unjustified number of participants/delegates, without 

clear information as to the individual participant’s role/function in 

attending such activity to determine its necessity and no individual 

narrative reports submitted for such undertaking, contrary to AO No. 

6, s. 2017 and EO No. 77 dated March 15, 2019. 

 

27.16 As specifically indicated under Section 1 of AO No. 6, s. 2017, 
notwithstanding the repeal of AO No. 103, s. 2004, existing laws, rules and 

regulations mandating the judicious and prudent use of government funds 

shall remain in full force and effect, and all agencies and instrumentalities 

shall continue to ensure that no irregular, unnecessary, extravagant, 

excessive and unconscionable expenses shall be incurred by the 

government. 

 

27.17 Section 3 of EO No. 77 dated March 15, 2019, prescribing rules and 
regulations and rate of expenses and allowances for official local and foreign 

travels of government personnel, provides that: 

 

(a) Official local or foreign travels and assignments under this order shall 
cover only those which meet the following criteria: (i) it is essential to 

the effective performance of an official or employee’s mandates or 

function; (ii) it is required to meet the needs of the department, agency, 

bureau or office, or there is substantial benefit to be derived by the 

State; (iii) presence of the official is critical to the outcome of the 

meeting, conference, seminar, consultation or any official activity to 

be attended; (iv) the projected expenses are not excessive or involve 

minimum expenditure.  

 

(b) All officials authorized to approved local or overseas travels are 
required, as far as practicable, to minimize travel cost. Hence, all 

forms of communications, such as but not limited to teleconferencing 

and videoconferencing or submission of briefs and position papers, as 



192 

 

alternative to travel, must be explored, provided these do not 

compromise national security and confidentiality of official 

communications. 

 

27.18 Section 9 of the same EO refers international conferences and meetings to 
which the Philippine Government has commitments, or to undertake official 

missions/assignments which cannot be assigned to government officials 

posted abroad.  Furthermore, in case of trips outside the Philippines 

involving delegations, “the authorized approving authority shall ensure 

that the number of participants is kept to the barest minimum and the role 

of each member in the delegation is clearly specified and justified in the 

travel application or proposal.” 

 

27.19 Records showed that the amount spent amounting to ₱4,351,223.04 
exclusive of plane fare and other related costs pertains only to two 

international meetings/conferences held in Singapore, as shown in the 

following table:

Total 5,867,676.90  4,351,223.04  

 

27.20 It was noted that the Authority to Travel granted for the 1st Technical 
committee meeting for the 13th ASEAN Skills competition conducted on 

December 8-13, 2019 at the Grand Copthorne Waterfront in Singapore 

provides only the names of the delegates, office and designation.  

 

27.21 A Technical Skills Upgrading Program was held in Singapore in September 
2019. The terms of reference provides that the proposed training will be 

conducted in Singapore with a 5-day Strategic Plan and Implementation to 

be attended by 25 key leaders who are involved in policies and strategic 

planning within TESDA. Apparently, the said program was attended by 26 

delegates composed of (1) Director in Charge, (1) Security Guard, (14) 

Instructors, (4) Professors and (6) TESD Specialist for a span of 12 days 

 

27.22 As can be observed, the nature of the activity does not require the attendance 
of such number of delegates. The travelling cost incurred for the attendance 

of these meetings was unreasonable and excessive and contravenes the 

policy mandating the judicious and prudent use of government funds. 

 



193 

 

27.23  Moreover, all of the delegates who participated did not submit narrative 
report to support the necessity of their attendance crucial to the outcome of 

the said meetings. 

 

27.24 We recommended that the Management of TESDA CO: 
 

a. explain why the cost incurred for these activities shall not be 
disallowed in Audit, and 

 

b. require all the individual participants to submit narrative 
report as to the importance/necessity of their presence in the 

said international meetings and their actual 

participation/involvement for the attainment of the desired 

outputs.  
 

27.25 During the Exit Conference, the Management explained that the Technical 
Committee Meeting is very important part of the ASEAN Skills 

Competition (ASC) in preparation for the hosting of the 14th ASC in 2022. 

That the attendance of delegates is very crucial in the preparation of the 13th 

ASC in 2020 and the Country hosting in 2022. 
 

27.26 The Audit Team will assess the documents and justification submitted. 
 

27.27 Six TESDA top Officials had participated in the Education World 
Forum (EWF) held, in London, England  in January 2020 with 

questionable authority, and the  purpose of  which does not satisfy  the 

following minimum criteria: (i) it is essential to the effective 

performance of an official or employee’s mandates or function; (ii) it is 

required to meet the needs of the department, agency, bureau or office, 

or there is substantial benefit to be derived by the State;         (iii) 

presence of the official is critical to the outcome of the meeting, 

conference, seminar, consultation or any official activity to be attended; 

(iv) the projected expenses are not excessive or involve minimum 

expenditure. 

 

27.28 Review and evaluation on the documents attached to the cash advances 
drawn for the said foreign travel revealed the following deficiencies: 

 

• There was no approved travel authority from the Office of the President 
for Secretary General, what was attached to the grant of cash advance 

was his request for travel authority dated December 23, 2019. 

 

• The letter of invitation allegedly sent by the UK Secretary of State for 
Education was not also attached. 

 

• There was a photocopy of a letter addressed to Secretary General, dated 
December 18, 2019, reiterating the invitation, to attend the Education 

World Forum (EWF) on January 20-22, 2020 with information that the 



194 

 

British Council will shoulder the international flights, accommodation 

costs and visa fee. 

 

• Moreover, another letter also dated December 18, 2019 addressed to the 
Secretary General, extending the invitation to the following officials of 

TESDA: 

 

1. Deputy Director General for Policies and Planning 
2. Former Deputy-Director General for TESDA Operations 
3. Former Director for Administrative Services  

 

• The sudden extension of the invitation to the three officials appears to 
be questionable considering the cost of international flights and 

accommodation. However, it was noted that the invitation of these 

officers did not provide any information whether part of the travelling 

expense will be shouldered by the British Council. 
 

• A Memorandum dated December 23, 2019 granting authority to attend 
the Education Work Forum of the three (3) officers but said authority 

also includes additional two officials, Deputy Director for Communities 

and Local Government Units General and Director-in-charge, Financial 

and Management Services. 

 

• A photocopy of Program Itinerary typewritten in paper with a British 
Council logo was attached but the document is not signed. 

 

• There were inconsistencies on the dates for the scheduled activity, as the 
letter of the Country Director, Philippines stated in the Subject caption 

that meeting shall be held on January 20-24, 2020, but in the body of 

letter it was stated that the activity will be conducted on January 20-22, 

2020. On the other hand, the letter of the Head of Education stated that 

the activity is from January 20-23, 2020, while the Program of Itinerary 

also showed a three (3) day activity from January 20- 23, 2020. But the 

itinerary of travel attached to the grant of cash advance covers the period 

January 18, 2020 to January 26, 2020 or for nine days inclusive of travel 

time. 

 

27.29 Based on the Program Itinerary, the schedule of activities presented are not 
directly aligned with the mandate of TESDA and sending other five (5) 

officials to attend said activity was unnecessary and contrary to existing 

rules and regulations mandating the judicious and prudent use of 

government resources. 

 

27.30 Based on records, three officials were granted cash advances for travelling 
expenses aggregating P481,269.48 excluding cost for air fare. It was also 

observed that there were excessive provisions for travelling allowances but 

completion of the audit was held in abeyance pending submission of 

liquidation reports. 

 



195 

 

27.31 We recommended that Management of TESDA CO: 
 

a. require the immediate submission of liquidation reports and all the 
supporting documents including travel reports; 

 

b. provide copy of authority from the Office of the President for Sec. 
Lapeña’s travel; 

 

c. submit the original copy of invitation from the UK Secretary of 
State for Education; and 

 

d. provide justification for the attendance of the other five officials, 
and how their participation brings substantial benefits to TESDA 

in particular and the Country in general. 
 

27.32 The Management submitted documents including a copy of Authority to 
Travel of the Secretary subject to assessment/validation of the Audit Team. 

 

c. Unnecessary incurrence of publication expenses 
 

27.33 No copy of newspaper clippings evidencing publication for the cost 
incurred amounting to ₱1,076,166.00 was submitted, contrary to the 

documentary requirements provided under COA Circular No. 2012-

001. Moreover, disbursements amounting to ₱1,492,986.00 for 

newspaper publication of TESDA Board Resolutions are considered 

unnecessary per COA Circular No. 2012-003 and can be dispensed with 

without loss on the part of the Government or cause inconvenience on 

the part of TESDA and shall not affect the validity and enforceability 

of the resolutions. 

 

27.34 The Printing and Publication Expenses for the year ended December 31, 
2020 had amounted to ₱7,990,122.99. The said account consists of payment 

for photocopying, printing of certificates, brochures, reports and publication 

of Board Resolutions, among others. 

 

27.35 Audit of the Expenses account revealed that ₱1,492,986.00 was paid to 
PhilStar Daily Inc., and Phil. Daily Inquirer for the publication of TESDA 

Board Resolutions. Details of which are shown below:

27.36 COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 on updated guidelines 
on the prevention and disallowance of irregular, unnecessary, excessive, 

extravagant and unconscionable expenditures, provides that: 

 

Unnecessary Expenditures-Pertains to expenditures which could not 

pass the test of prudence or the diligence of a good father of a family, 

thereby denoting non-responsiveness to the exigencies of the service. 

Unnecessary expenditures are those not supportive of the 

implementation of the objectives and mission of the agency relative to 

the nature of its operations. This would also include incurrence of 

expenditure not dictated by the demands of good governance, and those 

the utility of which cannot be ascertained at a specific time. An 



197 

 

expenditure that is not essential or that which can be dispensed with 

without loss or damage to property is considered unnecessary. The 

mission and thrusts of the agency incurring the expenditures must be 

considered in determining whether or not an expenditure is necessary. 

(underlining ours) 

 

27.37 COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 provides that: 
 

9.1.3.5 Advertising Expense Additional Documentary Requirements 

 

Bill/Statement of Account 

Copy of Newspaper clippings evidencing publication and/or CD in 

case of TV/Radio Commercial” 

 

27.38 Audit disclosed that payment for LDDAP Nos. 101101-03-059-2020, 
101101-03-070-2020, 101101-06-153-2020, and 101101-09-243-2020 

totaling ₱1,076,166.00, has no attached copy of newspaper clippings as 

evidence or proof of the actual publication. 

 

27.39 Moreover, we have observed that the publication of TESDA Board 
Resolutions in the newspaper is unnecessary as the Agency including its 

ROs has its respective website where the said Resolutions can be accessed 

by the interested stakeholders anytime, without additional cost to the 

government.  

 

27.40 Apparently, TESDA failed to consider other avenues to publish its issuances 
and resolutions such as the TESDA website, which is accessible nationwide 

and other available social media platforms for dissemination of information. 

It was observed that the latest uploaded TESDA Board Resolutions in the 

Agency’s website was Resolutions No. 2019-79 dated December 17, 2019. 

Resorting to newspaper publication for CY 2020 TESDA Board approved 

Resolutions and spending ₱1,492,986.00 was unnecessary and without 

reasonable basis. 

 

27.41 TESDA Resolutions do not affect the public in general and do not affect 
substantial rights of those governed nor adds burden to those concerned, 

hence, newspaper publication which is too costly is viewed as unnecessary 

and can be dispensed with without loss on the part of the Government nor 

inconvenience on the part of TESDA and most importantly do not affect the 

validity and enforceability of the said resolutions. 
 

27.42 We recommended that the Management of TESDA CO:  
 

a. submit explanation why the Agency resorted to newspapers 
publication, which is unnecessary and expensive; 

 

b. submit all newspaper clippings for paid publication; and  
 



198 

 

c. utilize TESDA website and other available facilities for the 
dissemination of TESDA issuances and resolutions. 

 

27.43 Management comments are as follows: 
 

• That TESDA Board is the policy determining arm of TESDA pursuant 
to its mandate as stated in Section 8 of RA No. 7796. 

 

• Not all Board Resolutions were published in newspapers of general 
circulation. Out of the 63 Board Resolutions issued by the TESDA 

Board in 2020 only 50 Board Resolutions were published. Thirteen (13) 

Board Resolutions were not published, considering that such Board 

Resolutions pertain to internal application of policies and do not affect 

the general public. 

 

• It is opined that publication is required for the validity and effectivity of 
the policies issued by the TESDA Board through Board Resolutions in 

accordance with the Administrative Code of the Philippines and 

applicable jurisprudence. 

 

• The publication of the TESDA Board Resolutions through newspaper 
was made even in years prior to 2020, despite the posting of the Board 

Resolutions in the TESDA website. Prior to this year, we were not 

informed of any COA observation that publication of Board Resolutions 

in newspaper is considered as unnecessary expenditure. 

 

• However, despite the foregoing justification, should COA deem it 
proper and legal to stop the publication of policies issued by the TESDA 

Board in newspapers of general circulation, the Management will 

readily comply upon receipt of explicit instructions on the matter. 

 

27.44 Audit Team’s Rejoinder are as follows: 
 

• The Audit Team did not question the power and functions of the Board 
as provided under Section 8 of RA No. 7796. 

 

• The Audit Team agreed that publication is necessary for the validity and 
effectivity of laws, rules and regulations but Board Resolutions are not 

laws per se, they differ fundamentally in their purpose. There is no 

general requirement on the required publication of Board Resolutions, 

and its validity only requires that a meeting was properly convened, 

quorum is maintained and the resolution is duly certified and signed. 

The Audit Team only wants to emphasize that if newspaper publication 

can be dispensed with, without causing damage to the Agency’s 

operation or will not place the Agency at a disadvantage, other less 

expensive means can be considered to comply with the publication 

requirement. The maintenance of TESDA website nationwide can 

validly suffice regarding the publication requirement. 

 



199 

 

• Access to information nowadays is easier than before and we cannot 
deny the fact that more people now get news from social media sites 

rather than print newspaper because of the convenient access.  If the 

Agency was not informed before of any COA observation that 

publication of Board Resolutions in newspaper is considered as 

unnecessary expenditure, it doesn’t mean that the current Audit Team is 

now estopped or prevented to ascertain the necessity of said expenditure. 

   

d. Irregular charges of food/meals expenses  
 

27.45 Charges to cash advance for food/meals amounting to ₱827,521.49 by 
TESDA CO in CYs 2019 and 2020, incurred during urgent consultative 

meetings with different group/leaders such as, Local Government 

Officials, National Executive Leaders, TESDA Partners and 

Stakeholders, TVI Leaders and Others were not supported with 

documents that can attest that the meetings were actually held and 

attended by the identified groups. Moreover, food or meal charges 

representing 44 percent or ₱385,694.95 of the total charges made were 

incurred during Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays and after office hours, 

rendering the charges irregular. 

 

27.46 Section 4 (6) of PD 1445 provides that “Claims against government funds 
shall be supported with complete documentation”. 

 

27.47 COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 defines unnecessary 
and irregular expenditure as: 

 

“The term “irregular expenditure” signifies an expenditure incurred 

without adhering to established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, 

policies or practices that have gained recognition in laws. Irregular 

expenditures are incurred if funds are disbursed without conforming with 
prescribed usages and rules of discipline. xxx” 

 

27.48 The Office of the Director General was provided with regular cash advance 
through Mr. Pedro Lanto, intended for urgent consultative meetings with 

various group leader/representative of ₱100,000.00, this is on top of the 

ODG’s claim for Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses and 

reimbursements for travels and meetings attended. 

 

27.49 Total liquidation/replenishment made in CYs 2019 and 2020 had amounted 
to ₱827,521.49, details of which are provided below:

TOTAL  827,521.49 

 

27.50 Audit of the liquidation reports pertaining to the regular cash advance 
granted showed that all charges were not supported with notice of meeting 

and minutes of the meeting. There were no attendance sheet and the names 

of the participant were not specifically identified. 

 

27.51 The attached daily schedule/agenda of meeting has no specific details, and 
usually involved the same group/leaders for the same or similar repetitive 

topics/issues. 

 

27.52 The ORs attached to the replenishment vouchers for scheduled daily 
meetings were mostly of small amount/value issued by various food 

chains/outlets such as Jollibee, McDonald, Chowking and others, located in 

different areas in Metro Manila. 

 

27.53 Moreover, review of various ORs attached to the replenishment vouchers 
showed that 44 percent or ₱385,694.95 of food/meals charges were incurred 

during Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays and after office hours that renders 

said charges highly questionable and irregular. It was also observed the 

some ORs are of small amount raging from ₱100 to ₱500 that usually covers 

only one serving which does not actually correspond to the nature of the 

intended purpose.  Presented below are the summary of highly questionable 

and irregular charges to the cash advance.

27.54 The foregoing deficiencies observed actually denote unnecessary and 
irregular uses of government funds, and imply that the cash advance/s were 

not actually utilized for the intended purpose.  

 

 

 



201 

 

27.55 We recommended that Management of TESDA CO: 
 

a. immediately stop the grant of the cash advance; and 
 

b. require the Accountable Officer to submit documents to prove 
that all charges were valid and officials, or else refund the 

amount spent for questionable payments. 

 

27.56 During the Exit Conference it was informed by the Director of Finance that 
they were already instructed to look into the matter. 

 

e. Incurrence of expenditures in excess of subsidy for PS and MOOE 
 

27.57 Overdrafts in subsidy totaling ₱4,074,951.70 were incurred for PS and 
MOOE by TESDA NCR District Offices of Pasmak, QCDO and 

QCLBSDC, contrary to Section 41 of E.O. No. 292, Book VI, Chapter 

5.  

 

27.58 Section 41 of E.O. No. 292, Book VI, Chapter 5 provides that: “heads of 
departments, bureaus, offices and agencies shall not incur nor authorize the 

incurrence of expenditures or obligations in excess of allotments released 

by the Secretary for their respective departments, offices and agencies. 

Parties responsible for the incurrence of overdrafts shall be held personally 

liable therefore.” 

 

27.59 Section 79 of R.A. No. 11465 otherwise known as the GAA for FY2020 
provides that: “Disbursement or expenditures incurred in violation of the 

existing laws, rules and regulations shall be rendered void. Any and all 

public officials and employees who will authorize, allow or permit, as well 

as those who negligent in the performance of their duties and functions 

which resulted in the incurrence or payment of unauthorized and unlawful 

obligations or expenditures shall be, personally liable to the government for 

the full amount committed or expended and, subject to disciplinary actions 

in accordance with Section 43, Chapter 5 and Section 80, Chapter 7, Book 

VI of E.O. No. 292. 

 

27.60 The District Offices normally received cash subsidy from the RO to cover 
its Personnel Services (PS) and Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses 

(MOOE) including the Scholarship Program Funds requirement for the year. 

Review of the disbursements of the three DOs/IUs in NCR revealed the 

incurrence of overdraft in disbursements against the corresponding 

subsidies received for PS and MOOE:

Total    (4,074,951.70) 

 

27.61 The overdraft in subsidy means that the disbursements made had exceeded 
the allotted budget/subsidy release. Since the incurrence of overdraft is 

strictly prohibited, incurrence thereof is considered irregular disbursement 

and therefore disallowable in audit and shall become the personal liability 

of the approving officials. This is also a clear manifestation of laxity in the 

control of cash that exposes government funds to possible misappropriation 

of improper disposition. Under this condition, most likely, the unutilized 

scholarship funds had covered the overdraft which is also prohibited 

because program fund can only be utilized for the purpose it was intended.   

 

27.62 We recommended that the Management of DOs PasMak, QCDO and 
the QCLBSDC to account and document the subsidy overdraft 

incurred and coordinate with the RO for the possible release of 

additional subsidy, otherwise this will be considered as irregular 

expenditure which is a personal liability of the approving officials upon 

issuance of Notice of Disallowance. 

 

27.63 Management Comments and Audit Team’s Rejoinder are as follows: 
 

DO /OUs Comments/Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

PasMak There was no overdraft in the subsidy provided by the RO based on the 

attached detailed presentation of expenses. There was no overdraft for 

CY 2020 since the accumulated expenses for PS and MOOE is less than 

the amount of fund transfer to the District. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

The determination of the overdraft incurred was based on the actual 

subsidy released per records of the DO and the actual expenses 

incurred/paid based on the Report of Check Issued. However, the Audit 

Team will review the submitted documents. 

 

During the Exit Conference, the TESDA-NCR Accountant that they 

have provided a copy of SAOB to prove that there was no incurred 

overdraft. The Audit Team requested details based on RCIs for 

reconciliation against the MOOE since the SAOB did not indicate 

details.

f. Advance payment for services not yet rendered  
 

27.64 TESDA ISAT salaries/remittances amounting to ₱3,195,277.02 pertains 
to succeeding months services not yet due but paid in advance to avoid 

the lapsing of NCA, circumventing existing regulations and constitute 

irregular disbursements or uses of funds. 

 

27.65 Section 4 of DBM Circular Letter 2013-12 provides that “Starting January 
1, 2014, all NCAs for crediting to Regular MDS sub-accounts for any 

month, whether part of the comprehensive releases or constituting additional 

NCA releases, shall be valid until the last working day of the 3rd month of 

that quarter. NCAs released during the quarter, e.g., February and March, 

shall be valid up to March 31, etc.” 
 

27.66 Section 88 (1) of PD No. 1445 provides the prohibition against advance 
payment of government contracts which specifically states that “Except 

with the prior approval of the President (Prime Minister) the government 

shall not be obliged to make an advance payment for services not yet 

rendered or for supplies and materials not yet delivered under any contract 

therefor. No payment, partial or final, shall be made on any such contract 

except upon a certification by the head of the agency concerned to the effect 

that he services or supplies and materials have been rendered or delivered 

in accordance with the terms of the contract and have been duly inspected 

and accepted.” 

 

27.67 Examination of checks issued on June 30, 2020 revealed that ADA and 
check payments for salaries of employees including remittances for 

premium for mandatory contributions for July 2020 to September 2020 were 

already paid with a total amount of ₱3,195,277.02 representing the net pay 

of employees and remittances, detailed as follow:

27.68 Inquiry with the Accountant was conducted on the matter and he explained 
that said amount was processed and issued to avoid the reversion of 

unutilized cash allocation/fund specifically the PS allotment.  Hence, 

instead of reverting the same to the BTr, such was utilized for salaries in the 

next quarter which should not be the case. Succeeding comprehensive 

NCAs shall be issued to cover the second semester requirements thus, this 

practice of the entity is an act of circumventing the existing regulations to 

avoid lapsing of cash allocation. 
 

27.69 We recommended that Management of TESDA-ISAT to direct the 
Accountant not to allow advance payment using unutilized cash 

allocation at the end of every quarter, for services not yet rendered 

pursuant to Section 88 (1) of PD No. 1445.  Any unutilized amount 

should be reverted to the BTr pursuant to Section 4 of DBM Circular 

Letter 2013-12 dated November 21, 2013. The Head of the Entity and 

the Accountant shall ensure that no advance payment of salaries is 

being processed, otherwise both shall be held accountable for any 

consequences of this action. 

 

g. Grant of hazard pays without legal basis 
 

27.70 Hazard pay totaling ₱398,500.00 was granted to PTC-Bukidnon and 
PO Davao Oriental personnel who reported for work during the 

implementation of GCQ in their areas, however, only those covered by 

community quarantine classification of either ECQ or MECQ is 

authorized for the grant of hazard pay as specified under AO No. 26, s. 

2020 as amended by AO No. 43, s. 2021, thus resulted in irregular and 

excessive payment of hazard pay benefit. 
  

27.71 Administrative Order (AO) No. 26, s. 2020 authorizes the grant of hazard 
pay to government personnel who physically report for work during the 

period of implementation of an Enhanced Community Quarantine relative 

to the COVID-19 outbreak, to wit: 

 

Section 1. Gant of the Hazard Pay. National Government Agencies 

(NGAs), including state universities and colleges and government-owned 

or –controlled corporations (GOCCs), are authorized to grant COVID-19 

Hazard Pay to personnel who physically report for work during the 

implementation of an Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) in their 

respective work stations, in an amount not exceeding P 500.00 per day per 

person, which shall be computed as follows: 

 

COVID-19 Hazard Pay = ₱500 x Number of days physically 

reporting for   work during the quarantine period 

 

Section 2. Conditions on the Grant of Hazard Pay. The heads of the 

government agencies may grant the COVID-19 Hazard Pay to their 

personnel without the need for further approval of the Department of 

Budget and Management (DBM), provided the following conditions are 

met: 



205 

 

 

a. The personnel are occupying regular, contractual or casual positions, 
or are engaged through COS, JO or other similar schemes; 

 

b. The personnel have been authorized to physically report for work at 
their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official 

working hours by the head of agency or office during the period of 

implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine measures in the 

area of such office or work station; and 

 

c. The rate of COVID -19 Hazard Pay shall be based on the number of 
days an employee physically reports for work using the formula under 

Section 1 thereof.  
 

27.72 AO No. 26 was amended by AO No. 43 s. 2021 further authorizing grant of 
hazard pay to personnel who reported to work during implementation of 

ECQ or MECQ. 
 

27.73 The above guidelines and conditions were formally adopted by TESDA 
through the issuance of TESDA Memorandum No. 147 series of 2020 on 

April 2, 2020 reminding compliance to the Administrative Order (AO) No. 

26 dated March 23, 2020 issued by the President and the above cited DBM 

Circular. 

 

27.74 Post-audit of the DVs revealed that payments of hazard pay were made to 
TESDA PTC- Bukidnon personnel for the months March to April 2020 

amounting ₱233,500.00 whereas Davao Oriental PO paid hazard pay 

totaling ₱227,500.00 to its JO Personnel and Trainers who have rendered 

physical reporting during the period of ECQ from April 4 to May 20, 2020. 

However, verification revealed that the entire province of Bukidnon was 

under GCQ starting March 17, 2020 and continued to be under GCQ starting 

April 27, 2020 as per issued EO Nos. 13, 20, and 21, series of 2020. On the 

other hand, Davao Oriental was under ECQ starting April 7, 2020 and 

extended until April 26, 2020 through issuance of EO Nos. 12 and 15, series 

of 2020.  

 

27.75 Therefore, grant of hazard pay benefit amounting ₱233,500.00 during 
implementation of GCQ in Bukidnon was irregular due to lack of legal basis 

whereas payment made by Davao Oriental PO resulted to overpayment 

amounting ₱165,000.00 as the granted hazard pay included payment for 

non-ECQ days hence, the overpayment needs to be returned otherwise shall 

be a basis for disallowance in audit. 
 

27.76 We recommended that Management: 
 

Region Office Recommendation 

X PTC 

Bukidnon 

submit legal basis specifying that the TESDA-PTC Bukidnon is 

located in places under ECQ or MECQ during the period April 

15 to 30, 2020. 



206 

 

Region Office Recommendation 

XI PO 

Davao 

Oriental 

a. require the Bookkeeper to render a written explanation why 
the payments include working days not within the ECQ 

period; and 

b. require the refund of the hazard pay on days that are not 
under ECQ. 

 

27.77 The following offices gave the following comments: 
 

Office Comments 

PTC 

Bukidnon 

Management explained that even though the entire province of Bukidnon 

was never placed under ECQ, there where lockdowns imposed in some 

barangays, leaving the personnel with no option but to pass through the 

infected barangays with extreme precaution just to report to office and 

comply to the directives from the CO and RO for fabrication of Intra-Venous 

Stands for hospitals gadgets and footbaths distributed to checkpoints, as well 

as providing education to individuals about health protocols. The situation 

has caused fear and anxiety to our personnel as food are getting scarce and 

transportation being limited that resulted to increase in expenses for food and 

mobilization. We believe that this is the reason why our top management has 

approved the release of the Hazard Pay as the personnel are at risk for 

frequent exposure to the public while performing out duties and 

responsibilities. 

PO Davao 

Oriental 

The payment of Hazard Pay was based on the RO computation through the 

google sheet shared to all OUs, notwithstanding the peculiarities of each 

province in terms of issuance by the local IATF, health standards and 

protocols. Management will issue demand letter to individual/concerned 

employees to refund the overpayment of P165,000.00 within the year. 

 

h.  payment of transportation allowance to officials with assigned 
government service vehicles 

 

27.78 Transportation Allowances (TAs) totaling ₱134,100.00 paid to the 
heads of four TESDA offices were irregular due to usage of government 

service vehicle while at the same time collecting TA and claims were not 

supported with certification as to no government vehicle was assigned 

to them, and certification that the vehicle undergone repair/s for a 

specific period, thus the non-use thereof could not be established, 

rendering the payments made irregular. 

 

27.79 Section 7.2.1 of the NBC No. 548 states that those who are assigned or who 
use government motor transportation shall no longer be entitled to the TA, 

but only to the commutable RA for the month. 

 

27.80 Likewise, pertinent provisions of Sec. 54a of the General Provisions of GAA 
for FY 2020 are quoted below for ready reference, to wit: 

 

“Transportation allowance, whether in full or partial amounts, shall not 

be granted to officials who are assigned or actually using government 

motor transportation. Officials who are assigned government motor 

transportation, but are not able to use said vehicle for justifiable reason, 



207 

 

as determined by DBM, may be granted transportation allowance during 

the said period.” 

 

27.81 Further, for the information of all concerned, quoted hereunder is the 
pertinent portion of the Supreme Court Decision under G.R. No. 112371 

dated October 7, 1998 in the case Aida Domingo vs. COA, held:  
 

“As correctly pointed by the Solicitor General, there are two instances 

when transportation allowance cannot be granted to a government 

official, as when a government official assigned a vehicle, and when a 

government official uses government transportation facilities. Xxx As 

maintained by the Solicitor General, whether or not herein petitioner 

used the vehicle assigned to her office, is not an issue, as it is undeniable 

that she could have used the said vehicle whenever she wanted to since 

it was assigned to her office.” 

 

27.82 Audit of disbursements disclosed the grant of TA to the PD of PO Bataan 
was excessive as verification revealed that the PD is using a government 

service vehicle and at the same time collecting TA in the full amount of 

₱8,500.00 per month totaling ₱34,000.00 for the months of June to 

September 2020, resulting in the excessive payment of her TA. According 

to the PD, the service vehicle was issued to the Administrative Officer, 

however documents showed that the PD is using the service vehicle as 

indicated in the submitted itinerary of travel thus, the PD is not entitled to 

the collection of the TA. 

 

27.83 Moreover, the TA claims of POs Samar, Biliran and CNSAT amounting 
₱100,000.00 appear not to be valid and appropriate since use of the agency’s 

government vehicle by the HOA is presumed, citing the reasons under the 

SC Decision in the case of Aida Domingo vs. COA. No certification of non-

issuance of service vehicle nor documents establishing the non-use of 

government vehicle due to non-availability thereof were attached to the 

disbursements to allow the proportional amount of TA. The payments for 

the TA claims resulted in overpayments of government funds contrary to 

existing laws, rules and regulations. 

 

27.84 We recommended that Management: 
 

Region Office Recommendation 

III PO

months of June to September 2020 amounting ₱34,000.00; 

III, VIII POs

208 

 

 

27.85 The following offices gave the following comments: 
 

Office Comments 

PO Bataan The Management commented that the PD already refunded the full amount of 

₱34,000.00. 

POs Samar, 

Biliran 

Management commented that the office has not assigned the service vehicle 

exclusive for the use of the Office of the Provincial Director.  The service is used 

for official transaction of the employees. In observance to the austerity measures 

the PD uses public transportation in going to RO to attend meetings and 

conferences to save the cost of fuel and travel allowance of the driver, except for 

travels within the province that requires the use of vehicle. Management also 

cited COA Circular 2000-005 on Regulations on Non-Entitlement where it was 

stated that Heads of agencies whose offices have been assigned vehicles and 

those officers to whom such heads specifically assigned a vehicle when there is 

more than one vehicle issued to the agency shall not be deprived of their 

transportation allowance on that basis alone. Further, whenever an official or 

employee entitled to transportation allowance uses the government vehicle 

issued to his office, a   corresponding   proportionate   reduction   on   his 

transportation allowance shall be made. With the aforementioned provisions of 

COA Circular No. 2000-005, the grant of TA for the PD is allowable. 

CNSAT The Management agreed to comply with all the legal basis to support the claim 

for TA and to submit the lacking supporting documents required by the Audit 

Team. 

 

27.86 As a rejoinder to the comments of TESDA Biliran PO and Samar PO, the 
stand of the Audit Team is that while non-use or actual use of vehicle 

remains unproven through documentations, whether or not a Head of 

Agency, the claims of TA could be invalid or at inappropriate amounts, 

based on Section 54 of the GAA for FY 2020, which mandates the existence 

of two conditions for TA to be prohibited: a) If assigned with government 

vehicle; or b) in actual use of said facility. Whereas, COA Circular No. 

2000-005 is opined entirely consonant to Section 41 of the General 

Provisions of GAA for FY 2000, which contains a different mandate that is 

prohibition of TA if claimant is in actual use of vehicle. As such, the 

justification given based on the latter may not be appropriate. 

 

i.  Grant of CNA Incentive not in accordance with existing rules and 
regulations 

 

27.87 TESDA CNSAT paid the amount of ₱383,064.72 to its officials and 
employees as Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) Incentive for FY 

2020 despite the unreliability of funding source, contrary to pertinent 

item in Congress Joint Resolution No. 4, series of 2009, dated June 17, 

2009; Section 71 of General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA; and Item 

4.3 of Budget Circular No. 2020-5 dated November 4, 2020, thus validity 

and propriety of the disbursements could not be ascertained. 

 

27.88 Item (4)(h)(ii) of Congress Joint Resolution No. 4, provides that the CNA 
Incentive may be granted to both management and rank-in-file employees 

of agencies with approved and successfully implemented CNAs in 

recognition of their effort in accomplishing performance targets at lesser 



209 

 

cost, in attaining more efficient and viable operations through cost-cutting 

measures and systems improvement. 

 

27.89 The General Provisions of the GAA FY 2020 provides: 
 

Sec. 71. Rules in the Grant of Collective Negotiation Agreement 

Incentive. Departments, bureaus, and offices of the National Government, 

including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs may 

grant Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) Incentive sourced from the 

allowable MOOE allotments identified by the DBM, subject to the 

following: 

 

(a) There is a valid CNA executed between the agency and the 
recognized employee organization which includes a provision on 

cost-cutting measures to be undertaken collectively by the agency 

and its personnel; 

 

(b) The one-time annual payment of CNA Incentive shall be made 
through a written resolution signed by agency representatives from 

both labor and management, and approved by the agency head; 

 

(c) The CNA Incentive that may be granted shall be limited to the 
amount determined by the DBM; and 

 

(d) The use of MOOE for the payment of CNA Incentive shall be 
subject to approval by the agency head and made only during the 

validity of appropriations. Any excess amounts therefrom after 

payment of the CNA Incentive shall revert to the General Fund. 

 

27.90 Budget Circular No. 2020-5 on Guidelines on the grant of CNA Incentive 
for FY 2020 provides the fund sources of the incentive as follows: 

 

4.3.1          For NGS, Including Constitutional Offices and SUCs 

 

The CNA Incentive shall be sourced solely from the available balances of 

allowable MOOE allotments after considering the FY 2020 requirements 

and compliance with the COVID-19 measures prescribed under Republic 

Acts No. 11469 and No. 11494, provided further that the same have 

become available as a result of cost-cutting and systems improvement 

measures undertaken collectively by the agency and its personnel, as 

identified in their respective CNA and supplements thereof. Such funds 

sources shall be limited to the following MOOE items defined under the 

Government Accounting and Auditing Manual; 

 

a. Advertising Expenses; 
b. Communication Expenses; 
c. Printing and Publication Expenses; 
d. Repairs and Maintenance; 
e. Subscription Expenses; 



210 

 

f. Supplies and Materials Expenses 
g. Transportation and Delivery Expenses 
h. Travelling Expenses 
i. Utility Expenses 

 

4.3.2  The following shall, in no case, be used as fund source of the   CNA 

Incentive: 

 
a. Balances of allotment for programs/ activities projects 

which were later discontinued or deferred; and 

b. Released Allotments intended for acquisition of goods and 
services to be distributed/ delivered to, or to be used by 

agency clients. 

Xxx 

12.2.1 Items under Personnel Services, Other MOOE, and/or Capital 

Outlay shall not be used to increase the allowable MOOE items as fund 

source for the FY 2020 CNA Incentive. 

 

27.91 CNSAT issued a check to the Disbursing Officer as cash advance for the 
distribution of CNA Incentive for FY 2020 to agency’s officers and 

employees, as follows: 

 

 

 

 

27.92 As NBC No. 2020-5 specifically provided that the fund source of the 
incentive shall be taken from the balance of the Allowable MOOE as a result 

of cost-cutting and systems improvement measures undertaken by the 

agency for the aforementioned expenses, the allowable balance of MOOE 

used as funding source to grant the CNA Incentive for FY 2020 amounting 

P383,064.72 was questionable, as payments for several expenses incurred 

such as utility, travelling and supplies and material expenses were charged 

against the SSP Fund, which could not prove that the performance targets 

were accomplished at a lesser cost, nor attained using more efficient and 

viable operations through cost-cutting measures and systems improvement.  

 

27.93 We recommended that the Management refrain from granting CNA 
Incentive without proper adherence to pertinent item in Congress Joint 

Resolution No. 4, series of 2009, Section 71 of General Provisions of the 

FY 2020 GAA, and Item 4.3 of Budget Circular No. 2020-5. 

 

27.94 The Management explained that the grant of CNA Incentive 2020 to its 
employees was based on the guidelines provided in Budget Circular No. 

2020-5 and TESDA Memorandum No. 540 series of 2020 re: Guidelines for 

the payment of CNA Incentive Package based on the allowed disbursements 

such as payment of electricity, internet connection and others. These 

disbursements were charged against the agency’s IGP Fund since electricity 

and internet connection were used during the conduct of trainings. Some 

disbursements mentioned were recorded under IGP Fund since there is no

approved appropriation/allocation based on GAA 2020 such as Semi-

Expendable Expenses. Also, other disbursements were accounted and 

recorded as Accounts Payable 2019 under IGP Trust Fund therefore, the 

payment of the said Accounts payable was charged against IGP Trust Fund 

2020. 

 

j. Non-Compliance with Documentary Requirements 
 

27.95 Various disbursements amounting to ₱41,709,468.41 were not duly 
supported with the prescribed documents to establish their validity, 

contrary to Section 4.6 of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001 

dated June 14, 2012. 

 

Section 4.6 of PD No. 1445 states that claims against government funds 

shall be supported with complete documentation.  

 

27.96 COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 on the Revised Guidelines 
and Documentary Requirements for Common Government Transactions 

advance the fundamental principles governing the financial transactions and 

operation of government agencies as provided under the above-mentioned 

provision of PD 1445.   

 

27.97 Post audit of DVs of eight (8) ROs revealed undocumented

appreciative of the audit observation where  at  

certain  point  serve  as  reminder to exert extra effort to improve 

its system and procedures and comply with the audit 

recommendations. 

PO Rizal The said documentary requirements were not attached as the 

Financial Analyst believes that as long as the official/employee, 

while in the actual performance of their respective functions, is 

hereby authorized monthly commutable representation and 

transportation allowance, hence, employees were paid for the 

said allowance without the need of documentation. Referring to 

the recommendation, they have already taken action on this 

matter. Thus, Management has directed the concerned 

personnel to submit lacking documents and also ensure the 

completeness of the documentary requirements prior to the 

processing of the disbursement voucher. They appreciated for 

bringing this matter to their attention and committed to follow 

the recommendations. 

RO VIII-PTC The Financial Analyst (FA) commented that the salaries of 

permanent employees were paid through Financial Data Entry

Compliance with the Procurement Law 
 

28. The CO and eight ROs failed to observe and/or comply with certain provisions 
of RA No. 9184 and its 2016 Revised IRR on various procurements of goods 

and services for CY 2020 in the total amount of ₱1.87 billion, which included 

the ₱1.85 billion that was transferred to PITC by the CO for the procurement 

of starter toolkits to be used in the implementation of 2019 STEP and 

UAQTEA programs. The outsourced procurements to PITC, at the onset, was 

apparently not favorable due to delays and various cancellations of 

procurements which hampered the attainment of the intended purpose of the 

outsourcing.

Section 7.3.2 The end-user units of the procuring entity shall prepare their respective 

Project Procurement Management Plans (PPMP) for their different 

programs, activities, and projects (PAPs).  The PPMP shall include: 

• information on whether PAPs will be contracted out, implemented

Section 7.3.4 The Project Procurement Management Plan (PPMP) shall be submitted to 

the Procuring Entity’s Budget Office for evaluation in order to ensure 

consistency with the Procuring Entity's budget proposal and compliance 

with existing budgeting rules. The PPMPs included in the budget proposal 

shall be forwarded to the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) Secretariat 

for consolidation into an indicative APP, and to the BAC for final 

recommendation of the appropriate procurement modality. 

Section 8.3.1 All Procuring Entities are mandated to fully use the PhilGEPS in 

accordance with the policies, rules, regulations, and procedures adopted 

by the GPPB and embodied in this IRR. In this connection, all Procuring 

Entities shall register with the PhilGEPS and shall undertake measures to

evaluate the financial component of the bids to determine the Lowest 

Calculated Bid using the following steps: 

 

32.2.1. The BAC shall immediately conduct a detailed evaluation of all 

bids using nondiscretionary criteria in considering the following:  

 

a. Completeness of the bid. Unless the Instructions to Bidders specifically 
allow partial bids, bids not addressing or providing all of the required 

items in the Bidding Documents including, where applicable, bill of 

quantities, shall be considered non-responsive and, thus, automatically 

disqualified. In this regard, where a required item is provided, but no 

price is indicated, the same shall be considered as non-responsive, but 

specifying a zero (0) or a dash (-) for the said item would mean that it 

is being offered for free to the Government, except those required by 

law or regulations to be provided for; and  

 

b. Arithmetical corrections. Consider computational errors and omissions 
to enable proper comparison of all eligible bids. It may also consider 

bid modifications if expressly allowed in the Bidding Documents. Any 

adjustment shall be calculated in monetary terms to determine the 

calculated prices. 

 

32.2.4.  Bids shall then be ranked in the ascending order of their total 

calculated bid prices, as evaluated and corrected for computational errors, 

and other bid modifications, to identify the Lowest Calculated Bid. Total 

calculated bid prices, as evaluated and corrected for computational errors, 

and other bid modifications, which exceed the ABC shall be disqualified. 

Section 52.1 Shopping is a method of procurement of Goods whereby the Procuring 

Entity simply requests for the submission of price quotations for readily

Failure to conduct Bidding 

CO CO 

More than ₱1.8 billion funds were transferred to PITC 

for outsourced procurement of starter toolkits to be used 

in the implementation of 2019 STEP and UAQTEA 

programs. The Management contended that the PITC 

specializes in procurement and has the experience, 

expertise, and proven track record when it comes to 

government procurement. However, the outsourced 

procurement to PITC at the onset, was apparently not 

favorable and delays and various cancellations of 

procurement were made which hampered the attainment 

of the intended purpose of the purchase. 

1,854,600,954.09 

IX RO 

The Agency automatically opted for SVP as the mode 

of procurement instead of public bidding for purchased 

starter toolkits for SSTP graduates-beneficiary. These 

items could hardly be classified under highly 

exceptional cases since the conduct of training is a 

programmed activity during the year and toolkits is 

distributed to students only after the completion of the 

training. Thus, there should have been ample time 

beforehand to conduct the process of public bidding as 

the mode of procurement.

Procurement of fuel and lubricants by the PO were not

Failure to conduct Bidding: 

Management in its letter commented that procurement of these 

SSTP toolkits were done by qualification and by provinces. 

Amount involve per PR does not exceed One Million Pesos and 

that it can be done through Alternative Mode of Procurement. 

Procedures and Guidelines with respect to SVP were being 

followed. Supplemental APP for these procurements were already 

made before processing these procurements. Rest assured that all 

recommendations are noted. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

We maintain our stand on the issues raised in our audit 

observations and recommendations. Contrary to what has been 

mentioned in the management reply that Supplemental APP has 

been made for that particular procurement, per verification with 



229 

 

Office/ 

Region 
OUs Management Comments and Auditor's Rejoinder 

the CY 2019 approved APP and supplemental APP submitted to 

our office, the SSTP toolkits were not included in the APP among 

the goods and services for procurement that year.  

 

Moreover, Section 48.2 and the other provisions of RA 9184 is 

clear and mandates that all procurement shall be done through 

competitive bidding regardless of whether or not the amount of 

items procured exceeds One Million Peso or below. The 

alternative mode of procurement is only warranted if occurring 

circumstances or conditions qualifies as highly exceptional cases. 

However, the procurement of toolkits could hardly be classified 

under highly exceptional cases considering that with proper 

planning, there would be sufficient time to conduct the public 

bidding since conduct of trainings is a predetermined activity and 

no such condition exist requiring the urgency of immediate 

purchase that could hamper the operation of the agency or pose 

danger to loss of life and property.  

 

Procurement through Reimbursements and/or cash advances: 

The Management have cited justifications on the incurrence of 

these expenditures but will nonetheless make effort to adhere with 

the audit recommendations. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit team maintain its stand on the audit recommendations 

provided and shall therefore monitor Agency's adherence on this. 

 

Other Deficiencies: 

The Management has provided justifications that one of the 

reasons why they do this is that they find it more economically 

advantageous to the government and that based on experience, it 

avoids further delay in the implementation of program as supply is 

not lodged under one supplier. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

We find merit to their justifications and explanations to our audit 

observations and recommendations. However, we maintain our 

stand on the issue raised in our AOM, that the steps required in 

Section 32.2.1 and 32.2.4 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184 

were not applied in awarding of bids.

29.3 Section 35, Chapter 6 on Disbursements of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, 
provides that:  

 

Cash Advance for Petty Operating Expenses. The Petty Cash 

Fund (PCF) to be set up shall be sufficient for the recurring 

petty operating expenses of the agency for one month. It 

shall be maintained using the Imprest System. All 

replenishments shall be directly charged to the expense 

account and at all times, the PCF shall be equal to the total 

cash on hand and the unreplenished expenses. The PCF shall 

be replenished as soon as disbursements reach at least 75% or 

as needed.  
 

29.4 PCF shall not be used for payment of regular expenses such as rentals, 
subscriptions, light and water bills, purchase of supplies and materials for 

stock purposes, and the like. 

 

29.5 Deficiencies noted in audit are as follows: 
 

RO/OUs Deficiency/Observation Amount 

Central 

Office 

Excessive grant of PCF has not been addressed as the practice 

continues as evidenced by setting up of PCF which is more than the 

sufficient recurring petty operating expenses for one month, and the 

low and long interval period of replenishment resulting to huge 

amount of cash in the hands of the PCF custodians exposing the fund 

to loss and possible misuse. 

 

It was further observed that there were excessive and duplicate grants 

of PCF for the same purpose to some PCF custodians, including three 

(3) PCF established to defray expenses for honorarium and 

transportation allowances of TESDA Board Members which are 

considered as regular expenses of the Agency and should not be paid 

through PCF. 

 

Lack of diligence in providing proper description and classification 

of accounts/transactions in the financial report, particularly on the 

nature of cash advances granted to AOs/Employees had resulted to 

confusion as to correct account to be used in the recording of the 

transactions affecting the accuracy of financial data.

30. Non-compliance with fidelity bond requirements pursuant to Section 101 of 
PD No. 1445, Treasury Circular No. 02-2009, and Section 7 of COA Circular 

No. 97-002 resulted in additional premiums paid by the Agency and exposed 

government funds to possible loss/misuse. 

 

30.1 Section 101 (2) of PD No. 1445 required that every AO shall be properly 
bonded in accordance with law. 

 

30.2 Whereas, Section 5.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-009 provides that “The 
amount of bond shall be based on the total accountability (cash, property 

and accountable forms) of the accountable public officer as determined by 

the Head of Agency. Provided, the individual maximum accountability of 

each accountable public officer shall not exceed One Hundred Million 

Pesos (₱100M). However, the Head of Agency may assign to other public

Lapses in the handling, recording and reporting of Accountable Forms under the AO’s 

custody 
 

31. TESDA CO and three ROs showed weak internal control system in the 
handling, recording and reporting of Accountable Forms under the AO’s 

custody which could affect the reliability and integrity of inventory reports at 

yearend and may result to possible wastage of government resources. 



237 

 

 

31.1 Section 123 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 defines internal control 
as the plan of organization and all the coordinate methods and measures 

adopted within an organization or agency to safeguard its assets, check the 

accuracy and reliability of its accounting data, and encourage adherence to 

prescribed managerial policies. 

 

31.2 Moreover, Section 124 added that it shall be the direct responsibility of the 
agency head to install, implement, and monitor a sound system of internal 

control. 

 

31.3 Review of various inventory reports and inventory management procedures 
of the TESDA offices revealed that there were lapses in the handling, 

recording and reporting of inventories by the concerned office’s AOs which 

are not in consonance with the pertinent rules and regulations as prescribed 

by GAM for NGAs and relevant issuances. These lapses are manifestation 

of weak internal control system set by the agency which could affect the 

reliability and integrity of inventory reports at year-end and possible 

wastage of government resources. Summary of these lapses are presented

to report on the movement and status of accountable forms in his/her 

possession. The accountable forms include those with or without face value. 

 

31.5 Further, Section 98 of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual 
(GAAM) volume I states that: 

 

Report of the accountable officer. — Accountable Officers shall render a 

report to the COA Unit Auditor on their accountability for accountable 

forms at least once a month in prescribed form. Such report shall also be

by invoice receipts, while issuances or utilization shall correspond with 

other financial reports such as the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) for checks, 

Report of Collection and Deposits (RCD) for OR and utilization report on 

Blank Certificate Issued or the prescribed Form No. TESDA-OP-CO-05-

AFs in the RAAF as of specific date shall equal to the receipts of AFs less 

the issuance/utilizations of AFs reported in the RCIs, RCD or TESDA-OP-

CO-05-F35. 

 

31.7 Strict and timely compliance with the preparation and submission of the 
RAAF and other relevant inventory reports is an indispensable procedure to 

safeguard the AFs against misuse and to ensure the correctness and 

reliability of the inventory balances at any given time. However, review of

Region Management Comments 

CO 
Management had submitted explanations and supporting documents on the deficiencies 

observed, but still subject to assessment/validation of the Audit Team. 

XII 

RO - The management replied that the NCs and COCs will be recorded by the Supply 

Officer considering that these are accountable forms and proper inventory is a MUST.  For 

check and balance purposes, from the Central Office, the Supply Officer will record it in 

TESDA OP-CO-05. PTCACs focal will request for the issuance and order of payment will 

be issued by the accounting before payment be done. Unpaid billings must be paid first 

before issuance of the next requested NCs/COCs. The management already submitted the 

utilization report on blank NCs as of January, 2021.  Both the PTCACs and Supply Unit 

will coordinate for the 

Submission of the said documents. 

  

CCDO - The Management of CCDO issued Office Order No. 9 series of 2020 on the 

designation of the PTCACS Focal dated March 16, 2020. They will provide copy of the 

transmittal and submitted tracking sheets to the Central Office and ensure the regular and 

timely submission of the utilization report as support to RAAF and furnish a copy of POs 

RIS or delivery receipts. 

 

b. Quantity of Accountable forms in stock/procured exceeds the requirement 
of RO IX and Storage/custody of bulk of Accountable Forms were under 

the custody of the AO instead of the Supply Officer 

 

31.10 Below are the pertinent provisions relevant to handling of accountable 
forms as prescribed in GAAM, Volume I: 

 



240 

 

Section 91. Accountability for official receipts. An official receipt is an 

accountable form held in trust by the Collecting 

Officer/Treasurer/Property Officer or other person duly authorized to 

possess or have custody thereof. He shall be responsible for its 

safekeeping, the proper and authorized, use or application thereof and the 

reporting of its use and condition; and shall be liable for loss, damage or 

deterioration occasioned by negligence in the keeping or use thereof. 

 

Section 94. Inspection of accountable forms received from the 

National Printing Office. Upon receipt of accountable forms from the 

National Printing Office, the Collecting Officer/Treasurer/Property 

Officer shall examine carefully each book or pad. He shall segregate any 

book or pad found to contain defects, such as incorrect series of numbers, 

or missing leaves or sheets etc. and submit it to the COA Unit Auditor 

together with a statement of the defects or deficiencies noted. 

 

Section 97. Issuance of accountable forms to accountable officers. 

Accountable forms shall be issued to bonded officers only in sufficient 

quantities not to exceed three months' use. 

 

31.11 In RO IX, examination of various AFs held by the AO of PO ZS as of July 
27, 2020 disclosed that the AO had the bulk of the following forms under 

his custody: 

 
Region Office Accountable Form Quantity 

IX PO ZS 

OR with RP Seal (Carbonless) - AF no. 51-C 174 pads 

National Certificates (NCs) 5,926 pieces 

Competency Assessment and Certification System 

(CACW) 
773 pieces 

Certificates of Competency (COC) 1,107 pieces 

LBP commercial checks 21 pads 

 

31.12 The quantity presented above clearly exceeds the consumption of the 
agency for three months, on the average, which can be a manifestation of 

weak control measures in the management of resources of the agency. As 

a general rule, a sound internal control exists when no one is in possession 

to make a significant deviation from rules and regulations or perpetrate 

irregularities. It includes procedures necessary to ensure transparency of 

accounts and other functions. 

 

31.13 With the accountability to these AFs lodged at one officer only, there 
could be no check and balance for the receipts and issuances. Moreover, 

the movements on these AFs are not properly accounted in the books of 

the agency. 

 

31.14 During the period September 2019 to current date, the agency had 
procured/received a total of 23,623 pieces of AFs without notifying or 

submitting said accountable forms to the Office of the Audit Team to 

conduct inspection to determine the existence of spoiled/damaged 



241 

 

pad/leaves and for guidance in identifying the responsibility for the error 

or deficiency. 

 

31.15 With the foregoing, we recommended the Management require: 
 

a. the AO to turn-over all the unused Accountable Forms to the 
Supply/Property Officer and retain accountable forms that 

could be consumed for a three-month period in order to have a 

better control measures for safekeeping of government 

property; 

 
b. the AO to submit a copy of the turn-over to the financial analyst 

for proper recording of the inventory account; and 

 
c. the Supply Officer to ensure that receipt of Accountable Forms 

of any type shall be forwarded to the Office of the Audit Team 

for inspection as provided in Section 94 of the GAAM, Volume 

1 for proper disclosures of defects, errors or deficiency, if any. 

 

31.16 Management informed that TESDA PO has no plantilla position for 
Supply Officer. The function of the Administrative Officer in the position 

description form includes Acts on all Cashiering activities including 

maintenance of cashbook and check disbursement record, property 

Management/Procurement and Maintain records of inventories, thus 

custody and bulk of Accountable Forms were under her custody. The AO 

had submitted already a copy of turned-over report to the financial analyst 

from the time she assumed as Senior Technical Education and Skills 

Development (TESD) Specialist on March 9, 2020. This office ensures 

that all Accountable Forms upon receipt shall be forwarded to the office 

of the audit team for inspection as provided in Section 94 of the GAM. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

31.17 The Audit Team noted the Management comments and it will be subject 
for validation and monitoring in CY 2021. 

 

c. Inconsistent and/or disparity of data in the interrelated inventory reports 
 

31.18 Chapter 2 of P.D. 1445 prescribed the following provisions: 
 

Section 111. Keeping of accounts. 

 

• The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is 
necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be 

adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control 

agencies of the government. 

 



242 

 

• The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall 
be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against 

inaccurate or misleading information. 

 

Section 112. Recording of financial transaction. 

 

Each government agency shall record its financial transactions and 

operations conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and 

in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations. 

 

31.19 Further, same decree clearly states under its Section 104 that: “The head 
of any agency or instrumentality of the national government or any 

government-owned or controlled corporation and any other self- 

governing board or commission of the government shall exercise the 

diligence of a good father of a family in supervising AOs under his control 

to prevent the incurrence of loss of government funds or property, 

otherwise he shall be jointly and solidarily liable with the person primarily 

accountable therefore. The treasurer of the local government unit shall 

likewise exercise the same degree of supervision over AOs under his 

supervision otherwise, he shall be jointly and solidarily liable with them 

for the loss of government funds or property under their control. 

 

31.20 With the foregoing provisions, the agencies are mandated to present its 
records of financial transactions and operations with highest standards of 

honesty, objectivity and consistency to provide the users accurate and non-

misleading information.  

 

31.21 Validation and comparison of inventory reports provided by the agency 
showed inconsistencies and the information provided by various offices 

for the same matter do not coincide with each other. Details of observation 

are as follows: 

 

RO Observation 

CO 

Verification of the RAAF for CY 2020 and other related reports disclosed 

that there were unreported receipts/deliveries of National TVET Trainer’s 

Certificates and National Certificates (NCs) costing ₱5,348,800.00 under 

the custody/accountability of the Competency Assessment Division 

(CAD) which were not recorded and accounted in the submitted RAAF. 

There were noted overlapping issuance of NCs to two (2) regions of 

TESDA. NCs with series CLN NQ 5354501-5357500 were reported 

issued to Region VIII on June 30, 2020 and same was also reported issued 

to Region XI on July 31, 2020. 

NCR- 

DO Manila 

Inconsistencies were observed on the RAAFs on NCs/COCs used by the 

Financial Analyst (FA) to record the receipts and issuances as against the 

RAAFs forwarded by the AO to the Audit Team showing a net variance 

of ₱3,780.00 equivalent to 108 certificates from the recorded year-end 

inventory balance. 



243 

 

RO Observation 

Submitted report by the RO on the receipt and utilization of NCs and 

COCs of DO Manila showed significant discrepancies from the latter's 

accounting records at year-end in the amount of ₱323,120.00 equivalent 

to 9,232 certificates. 

Comparison of the income generated from the issuances and 

renewals/replacements of NCs and COCs was found inconsistent with the 

DOs report of issuances per accounting records showing a net 

discrepancy of ₱117,110.00 equivalent to 3,346 certificates.  

 

31.22 These inconsistencies show laxity in the control and monitoring process 
of the AFs involved which also affects the established accountability of 

the AO. Moreover, the reliability of the balances reported in the books 

could not be ascertained and the integrity of the information presented in 

these inventory reports is therefore questionable. 

 

31.23 We recommended the Management of the concerned offices to: 
 

Region Recommendations 

CO 

• observe strict and timely compliance with the submission of the RAAF 
and submit the report to the Accounting Division together with the 

necessary supporting documents for purchases/issuances of 

accountable forms for recording in the books; and submit to the Audit 

Team for review/audit; 

 

• properly monitor issuance to ROs and require them to attach their 
RAAF to support their request for issuance; 

NCR-

• direct the FA and the AO to reconcile their reports with that of the 
RO’s report and make the necessary adjusting entries and submit the 

same to the Audit Team for review;  

 

 

Equipment issued to contractual employees - ₱ 30,216,417.49 

 
32. A total of ₱30,216,417.49 Other Machineries and Equipment of TESDA RO 

VIII were issued to trainers hired as contractual employees, thus exposing the 

assets of the agency to loss or wastage due to improper disposition, 

inconsistent with Section 2 of PD No. 1445. 

 

32.1 PD No.1445 states: 
 

Section 2. Declaration of Policy. It is the declared policy of the State 

that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or 

utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against 

loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to 

ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of 

government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully 



244 

 

adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency 

concerned. 

 

32.2 Review of the pertinent records of the Region showed that a total of 
₱30,216,417.49 Other Machineries and Equipment have been issued to 

various trainers hired as contractual employees. Moreover, of the 

aforementioned amount, ₱ 14,551,698.80 were already unserviceable. 

 

32.3 Inquiry with the agency official regarding this matter revealed that the 
trainers use the equipment for instructional purposes. However, these 

trainers are hired on a temporary basis and could not be held accountable 

to any liability in case of loss, damage or wastage due to the nature of their 

employment where no employer-employee relationship exists. 

 

32.4 We recommended that the Management should have proper 
disposition of their assets to safeguard against loss or wastage. 

Further, we recommended that the equipment be issued to permanent 

employees of the agency for proper accountability. 

 

32.5 The Management, particularly the Supply Officer, has agreed with the 
audit recommendations. 

 

Non-remittance of proceeds from sale of unserviceable properties - ₱80,699.00 

 
33. Proceeds from the Disposal of Unserviceable Property amounting to 

₱80,699.00 was not remitted to the BTr, which is not in consonance to the 

provisions of Section 14 of the General Provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 

11465 or the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020, Section 65, (1) 

of PD No. 1445 and Section 2 of EO No. 338 dated May 17, 1996. 

 

33.1 Section 14 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 
2020 provides that the proceeds from the sale of non-serviceable, obsolete 

or unnecessary equipment shall be deposited with the National Treasury as 

income of the General Fund. 

 

33.2 Section 65, (1) of PD 1445 provides " Unless otherwise specifically 
provided by law, income accruing to the agencies by virtue of the 

provisions of law, orders and regulations shall be deposited in the National 

Treasury or in any duly authorized government depository and shall accrue 

to the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund of the government.” 

 

33.3 Furthermore, Section 2 of EO 338 dated May 17, 1996 enjoined all 
government offices and agencies to immediately transfer all public moneys 

deposited with depository banks and other institutions to the BTr, 

regardless of income source. 

 

33.4 Audit on the disposal of unserviceable property of RO IX - ZSPI revealed 
that the proceeds from the sale amounting to ₱80,699.00 was deposited to 



245 

 

the Trust Fund account and was not remitted to the BTr. Details on the 

proceeds of the sale are shown below: 

 

OR No. Date Amount

02865395 01/13/2020 7,854.00  

Total   80,699.00 

 

33.5 Inquiry with the Accountant revealed that they are unsure on what to do 
with the abovementioned amount and thus, deposited it temporarily to the 

Trust Fund account. 

 

33.6 The non-remittance of the proceeds from the disposal of unserviceable 
property amounting to ₱80,699.00 to the BTr is not in consonance to the 

provisions of Section 14 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 or the 

GAA for FY 2020, Section 65, (1) of PD 1445 and Section 2 of EO 338 

dated May 17, 1996. 

 

33.7 We recommended that Management direct the Cashier and 
Accountant to immediately remit the proceeds of the disposal of 

unserviceable PPE to the BTr pursuant to Section 14 of the General 

Provisions of RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020, Section 65, (1) of 

PD 1445 and Section 2 of EO 338 dated May 17, 1996. 

 

33.8 Management commented that the said accumulated amount from the 
proceeds of the disposal of unserviceable PPE was remitted to the BTr, 

under OR No. 2134992, dated March 31, 2021. 

 

Unserviceable properties not yet disposed - ₱32,139,361.67 

 
34. Unserviceable PPE totaling ₱32,139,361.67 reported in the books of eight ROs 

were not disposed, contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 1445, thus would result in 

further loss of their economic value due to deterioration and depriving the 

government of additional revenue that may be generated from their sale. 

 

34.1 Section 79, PD No. 1445 requires that “When government property has 
become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon 

application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head 

of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the 

auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be 

destroyed in their presence.” (italics ours) 

 

34.2 Section 42(h) thereof, also provides that the Inventory and Inspection 
Report for Unserviceable Property shall be used to account for all 

unserviceable property of an entity which is subject to disposal. It also 

serves as the basis in derecognizing the unserviceable properties carried in 

the PPE accounts. 

 



246 

 

34.3 Review of the IIRUP and report of physical count of property of various 
Regions as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that the Agency has several 

unserviceable properties amounting to ₱32,139,361.67, as follows:

34.4 We recommended the Management to: 
 

a. instruct the Disposal Committee/ Property Officer to timely 
conduct the necessary disposal procedures pursuant to Section 

79 of PD No. 1445 so as not to deprive the government of the 

supposed benefits from the disposal of the unserviceable 

properties and to relieve concerned AOs from accountability; 

and 

 

b. prepare necessary adjusting entries to derecognize the 
disposed unserviceable assets pursuant to Paragraph d, 

Section 40, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I. 

 

34.5 Below are the comments of the Management of concerned Regions and the 
Audit Team’s rejoinder.

Respective Management signified their willingness 

and commented to implement the recommendations 

in accordance with the requirements prescribed under 

Section 79 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 and 

Paragraph d, Section 40, Chapter 10 of the GAM, 

Volume I. 

The Audit Team shall 

monitor management’s 

compliance on the audit 

recommendations. 

 

Non-compliance with Insurance of Government Property with GSIS under RA No. 656, 

otherwise known as the “Property Insurance Law” - ₱23,121,199.21 

 

35. In two ROs, properties totaling ₱23,121,199.21 were not covered by insurance, 
contrary to Section 5 of RA No. 656 and COA Circular No. 92-390, thus 



247 

 

depriving the Agencies of any indemnification in case of loss or damage due 

to fire, earthquake, storm and other calamities. 

 

35.1 Section 5 of RA No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law, 
provides that “Every government, except a municipal government below 

first class, is hereby required to insure its properties, with the Fund against 

any insurable risk herein provided and pay the premiums thereon, which, 

however, shall not exceed the premiums charged by private insurance 

companies: Provided, however, That the System reserves the right to 

disapprove the whole or a portion of the amount of insurance applied for: 

Provided, further, That such property or part thereof as may not be 

insurable or acceptable for insurance may be insured with any private 

insurance company.”  

 

35.2 Corollary to this, COA Circular No. 92-390 dated November 17, 1992 was 
also issued to ensure that all insurable assets and properties of the 

Government are adequately covered/insured with the General Insurance 

Fund of the GSIS. 

 

35.3 Audit of the properties of the Agency showed that in CY 2020, the 
following properties of certain Offices were not insured with the GSIS:

Total     23,121,199.21 

 

35.4 Non-preparation and non-submission of the Property Inventory Form 
within the prescribed period contrary to COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated 

May 31, 2018 precluded the assessment of general insurance coverage over 

all insurable assets, properties and interests of the government. 

 

35.5 Pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 2018-002 are as follows: 
 

5.1 Heads of government agencies shall direct the pertinent official under 

his/her supervision to: 

 

(b) Prepare the Property Inventory Form (PIF) listing of all the insurable 

properties and other assets, showing their latest appraised 

values/valuation, appraisal date, location, and other information; 

 

(e) Submit the consolidated PIF to the Supervising Auditor/Audit Team 

Leader and the General Insurance Fund (GIF), Government Service 

Insurance System (GSIS), not later than April 30 of each year;” 

 



248 

 

35.6 Compliance with the requirement will provide the government adequate 
and reliable protection against any damage to or loss of its properties or 

assets and interests due to fire, earthquake, storm, or other fortuitous 

events/casualty. 

  

35.7 For this reason, the preparation and submission of the PIF to the Audit 
Team and the GIF of the GSIS is essential as this will serve as the basis for 

the assessment of general insurance coverage over all insurable assets, 

properties and interests of the government. 

 

35.8 We recommended that the Management take appropriate action to 
insure the insurable properties of the Agency with the GSIS pursuant 

to RA No. 656 and COA Circular No. 92-390 to avoid/minimize 

incurrence of loss due to damage in case of fire, earthquake, storm and 

other calamities by way of indemnity. 

 

35.9 Below are the Management comments and the Audit Team’s rejoinder: 
 

RO Office Management Comments Auditor's Rejoinder 

III PO Nueva 

Ecija; PTC 

Palayan 

PO Nueva Ecija - The Management agreed 

to comply with the recommendations 

during the exit conference 

  

VIII BCAT BCAT - The Supply Officer explained that 

they have sent a list of insurable properties 

to TESDA RO VIII for insurance 

purposes. However, they did not receive 

any document or contract policy as proof 

of said insurance. The agency’s vehicle is 

usually insured with the GSIS, however, 

due to an accident, the vehicle had 

undergone repairs in CY 2020, and hence, 

they were not able to insure it for the year. 

The Audit Team requested 

the Management to submit 

and provide documents 

showing the insurance 

coverage of the agency’s 

properties. 

 
Reimbursement adopted as procurement process 

 

36. Training and other regular expenses totaling to ₱2,927,919.50 incurred by 

TESDA PPSAT, Region XI ROP, POs Davao Del Norte, Davao Oriental and 

DOPI were paid on reimbursement basis, which is not among those prescribed 

modes of procurement, due to lack of procurement planning contrary to 

Section 7, Chapter 6 of the New GAM, hence casting doubt on the validity and 
propriety of the transactions. 

 

36.1 Section 7, Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual, states that 
“The different modes of disbursements are as follows: (a) checks (MDS 

or commercial checks), (b) cash (out of cash advance granted to 

authorized Disbursing Officer), (c) advice to debit the account, (d) tax 

remittance advice, (e) working Fund/CDC, and (f) direct payment 

method.” 

 

36.2 Payment of various expenses totaling ₱2,927,919.50 as shown in the table 
below were made through reimbursements which if examined closely, 



249 

 

would reveal that these were regular expenses and for regular 

programs/activities which could have been planned and procured in 

compliance with RA 9184 and which could have been paid through checks 

payable to the account of the supplier/creditor and not to office personnel, 

visa viz: 

 

Office Amount  

Puerto Princesa School of Arts and Trade (PPSAT) 378,747.50 

Regional Office XI 1,394,503.64 

Davao Del Norte PO 486,826.87 

Davao Oriental PO 388,746.04 

Davao Oriental Polytechnic Institute 279,095.45 

Total 2,927,919.50 

 

36.3 Details of these expenses paid through reimbursement were purchases of 
office supplies, minor repairs, internet subscription, telephone charges, 

other professional services and food/meal and materials for training 

programs. These expenses cannot be classified as urgent/emergency in 

nature and should have undergone the usual government procurement 

process and should have been paid directly to the name/account of the 

supplier/payee through any of the applicable mode of disbursements 

enumerated above. 

 

36.4 Some of the above purchases were not canvassed, not properly inspected 
(no IAR attached as supporting document) and has no proof of issuance to 

end users (lacking Requisition and Issue Slips). The reimbursement of the 

above expenses which arose from activities/transactions that cannot be 

classified as urgent/emergency in nature is not justifiable, thus creating 

doubt on the validity on reimbursement adopted as the procurement 

process and casting doubt on the propriety of these expenses. 

 

36.5 From the foregoing data gathered, it is evident that the mode of 
procurement employed by the office has no legal basis because it is not 

the prescribed mode of payment as enshrined under Section 7 of GAM. 

These practices if continued will result to disbursements not undergoing 

the prescribed government procurement process and disbursement 

wherein the applicable taxes were not withheld as required by applicable 

BIR rules and regulations. Moreover, these payments cast doubt on the 

validity and propriety of the transactions. 

 

36.6 We recommended that Management of PPSAT, Region XI ROP, POs 
Davao Del Norte, Davao Oriental and DOPI: 

 

• refrain from using reimbursements as a regular mode of 
payment/disbursement. Instead, practice the payment thru 

checks to the account of the supplier/payee as prescribed by 

GAM; and 

 



250 

 

• plan the office activities/programs ahead and properly in order 
to systematize the procurement process for each quarter and in 

order to comply with the required process of procurement in all 

instances. 

 

36.7 The following offices gave comments/actions taken: 
 

Office Comments 

PPSAT The Vocational School Administrator (VSA) instructed Ms. Irene P. Sabuya 

(Bookkeeper), Ms. Karen T. Bromal (Collecting & Disbursing Officer) and 

Ms. Patricia T. Paladan (Budget Officer) to enforce proper planning in 

procurement of goods 

ROP XI Since most of reimbursements were due to the visits of Secretary Lapena, 

Management will get the scheduled visits of the Secretary ahead so they can 

prepare ahead. The Agency will plan and prepare ahead of the trainings or 

activities in order to systematize the procurement. The recommendations were 

well taken and Management will see to it that they will refrain from 

reimbursements. 

Davao Del 

Norte 

Provincial 

Office  

Beginning 2021, only the legal modes of procurement will be   implemented in 

compliance   with the   relevant provisions of the GAM. Incurred costs prior to 

issuance of AOM will no longer be reimbursed. The AO V/Disbursement Officer 

shall ensure that Petty Cash Fund is set up early in the year and replenish this as 

early as allowed so as not to use the personal resources just to ensure that no 

disruption in the operations such as fuel for the official vehicle. All procurement, 

including training expenses shall be programmed ahead of time and shall follow 

and comply with the requirements of RA 9184 and other government issuances.  

All required documentation and attachments are complete. 

Davao  

Oriental  PO 

The said expenses paid through reimbursement mode of payment generally 

belonged to the regular and mandatory expenses used for the operations for both 

in the PO and in PTC-Simtrac. But due to the unforeseen circumstances brought 

about   by the   pandemic and Mati City was under ECQ, Health Authorities   

were implementing Health protocols and standards to prevent the virus from 

spreading. Nonetheless, the Management will continue its effort to deliver the 

services without deviating the procurement law, to strictly follow the APP-CSE. 

The PO will designate permanent personnel in PTC-Simtrac who will act as petty 

cash custodian. 

Davao 

Oriental 

Polytechnic 

Institute 

Most of the reimbursements were related to walk-in assessments, requested and 

community-based trainings, expenses for bakery operations and various 

expenses paid by the Disbursing Officer. These expenses refer to unforeseen 

expenses that needed to be paid immediately that sometimes procurement 

process is compromised as the items were needed to be paid but available balance 

of petty cash fund was not sufficient. Nonetheless, to correct this practice, the 

Management will refrain from using reimbursements   as   a   regular   mode   of 

payment/disbursement. All end-users will be informed that requested purchases 

of supplies and materials requests shall go through the procurement process with 

complete supporting documents and payments shall be made directly to the 

supplier/payee through check or advice to debit   account, except   for   expenses   

arising   from urgent/emergency activities. In cases of unavoidable/urgent 

expenses, it will be reimbursed thru petty cash fund provided that attachments 

are complete. 

 

Non-completion of Building construction via Training Cum Production - 

₱3,912,936.00 



251 

 

 

37. Construction of Buildings via Training Cum Production with total budget cost 
of ₱3,912,936.00 in Regions IV-B and XII remained uncompleted for a period 

of three years, resulting in the non-attainment of the objectives and 

commitment to its intended beneficiaries and wastage of government funds 

and resources, in violation of Section 2 of PD No. 1445. 

 

37.1 Section 2 of PD No. 1445, otherwise known as “The State Audit Code of 
the Philippines”, declares: 

 

Section 2. Declaration of Policy. It is the declared policy of the State that 

all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in 

accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or 

wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring 

efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. 

The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to 

rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned. 

 

37.2 Likewise, Section 7.1 of RA No. 9184 requires that: 
 

“All procurement shall be within the approved budget of the Procuring 

Entity and should be meticulously and judiciously planned by the 

Procuring Entity.” 

 

37.3 Training-Gum-Production (TCP) shall be employed as a scheme in which 
various skills training programs will be conducted. The TCP shall be 

utilized such that the intended training supplies and materials shall be used 

for repair/refurbishment and rehabilitation of dilapidated 

workshops/laboratory buildings instead of having those training materials 

utilized to produce small-piece project outputs which would eventually 

become items for disposal. 

 

37.4 TCP will be part of a broader educational methodology of providing 
educational experiences which links the teaching-learning process with the 

world of work, so that the trainees not only gain relevant skills, knowledge, 

attitudes and values but also the necessary hands-on experience to apply 

these competencies learned.

Specification 

IV-B PPSAT The construction of a Two-Storey 

Dormitory Building under Training Cum 

Production scheme remained 

uncompleted and idle for more than three 

(3) years due to lack of additional fund 

releases from TESDA MIMAROPA 

Regional Office. 

 

Moreover, unused construction materials 

intended for the project totaling 

₱118,050.00 laid idle in the school 

premises. 

1,900,000.00 Commencement: July 25, 2017 

 

The implementation of the 

project will take 96 days from 

July 25 to November 15, 

2017—to be done by 125 

unemployed/ underemployed 

youth and adult men, at least 18 

years old, physically fit 

trainees who are interested to 

be trained as skilled carpenter, 

mason, electrician and 

plumber. 

XII GSNSAT The Two-Story Building Project through 

the training cum production program of 

TESDA remained not completed and left 

idle for more than three years from its 

implementation. 

 

The project remained unfinished and 

abandoned with construction debris all 

around and full-grown grasses at the 

construction site.  The project had been 

discontinued and remained untouched 

since the last inspection by the Audit 

Team on December 12, 2018. 

2,012,936.00 Commencement: September 

11, 2017 

 

The implementation of the 

project will take 35 days or an 

estimate of 2 months which is 

April to May 2017 to be done 

by 35 unemployed/under 

employed youth and adults 

physically fit trainees who are 

interested to be trained as 

skilled mason, carpenter, 

welder, plumber and 

electrician. 

TOTAL     3,912,936.00   

 
37.6 The continued delay in the implementation of these projects would further 

lead to deterioration of the whole structure which is a clear evidence of 

wastage of government resources. Further, this will result to non-

attainment of the objectives and commitment to its intended beneficiaries. 

 

37.7 With the foregoing, we recommended the Management of the 
concerned offices to: 

 

a. strictly adhere to the provisions of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 

9184 in the implementation of construction projects which 

includes training cum production infrastructure projects to 

ensure completion within target dates, maximize benefits of target 

beneficiaries, reduce/lower project costs and implement control 

measures and avoid issuance of Notice of Suspension and 

Disallowance for funds spent for incomplete project and avoid 

wastage of funds already spent for the project; 

 

b. conduct actual inspection and evaluation of the project site before 

preparing the Revised Design Plans based on current situation of 

the project. The detailed engineering investigation, surveys and 

design must be sufficiently carried out taking into consideration 

all the scope of work needed so that the purpose and benefits for 

which a project is constructed could be attained at the maximum 



253 

 

level. Include in the Project Procurement Management Plan only 

items that are needed to avoid the procurement of unnecessary 

construction materials; 

 

c. facilitate request for additional funding from TESDA Head Office 

thru their respective ROs, to fast-track project completion based 

on prepared Revised Design Plans based on current situation of 

the project together with the revised Engineering Plans, Program 

of Work and Bill of Materials to avoid the procurement of 

unnecessary construction materials, save whatever was previously 

spent for the project and ensure completion of the project; 

 

d. revise Design Plans, Engineering Plans, Program of Work and Bill 

of Materials based only on actual allocation received to ensure 

completion of the project; and, 

 

e. assign a Team to closely monitor implementation of the project to 

ensure immediate completion in accordance with the approved 

plans and budget for the attainment of the objectives/commitment 

to its intended beneficiaries and avoid wastage of government 

funds and resources. 

 

37.8 The Management commented that: 
 

RO-OUs Management Comments 

IV-B- 

PPSAT 

The TESDA Head Office had already conducted an actual site inspection and thereafter 

expressed that they would immediately release the pertinent funds in order to put the 

Phase 2 of the construction in motion. However, as of date, the additional funds and 

conduct of trainings so as to continue and complete the project remained uncertain. 

Ultimately, the management linked the absence of follow-through on this project to the 

ever-changing organizational structure of the TESDA. Also, the management can hardly 

comment on the probability of release of funds due to conflicting statements between 

the TESDA Head Office and TESDA-MIMAROPA Regional Office. 

XII- 

GSNSAT 

The management affirms the COA recommendations. In compliance with RA 9184, they 

have outsourced the services of a licensed engineer and has carried out all the detailed 

engineering work. With this, they already have the building permit with Bldg. 

Permit#2020-0221. The management also instructed the in-house technical personnel to 

review all plans and timetables to ensure that the project will still be completed in the 

coming months. They added that due to the change in management; lack of available 

funds; and COVID-19 pandemic the construction was discontinued. However, the Term 

of Reference was already submitted to the Regional Office to process the request on 

additional fund. Furthermore, they commit to utilize any available resources to proceed 

whatever they can for the construction. 

 

 Compliance with Other Mandatory Rules and Regulations 
 
 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

38. Deficiencies were noted in the implementation of GAD such as non-submission 
of GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) /Accomplishment reports, budget allocation 

below the required five percent, and activities not related to GAD, contrary to 



254 

 

DBM-NEDA-PCW Joint Circular No. 202-01 and Section 31 of General 

Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020. 

  

38.1 Section 31 of General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) 
FY 2020 or RA 11465 states that “All agencies of the government shall 

formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address 

gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the 

applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, 

Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against 

Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-

Responsive Development (1995-2025), and the Philippine Development 

Plan.” 

 

38.2 Section 6.1 of Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01 of DBM, National 
Economic Development Authority (NEDA) and Philippine Commission on 

Women (PCW) effective January 2013 provides that at least five percent 

of the total agency budget appropriations authorized under the annual 

General Appropriations Act shall correspond to activities supporting GAD 

plans and programs. It is understood that the GAD budget does not 

constitute an additional budget over an Agency’s total budget 

appropriation. 

 

38.3 The PCW also set timelines on the submission of FY 2020 GAD ARs 
through the PCW Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) as 

stated in Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 2021. 

Section VII of the said Circular required the submission of signed and 

GMMS-authenticated GAD AR to PCW which shall be furnished to the 

respective Audit Team. 

 

38.4 The following regions/offices have adhered with the provisions of the GAA 
to integrate GAD Plan in the regular activities of the Agencies and allocate 

at least five percent of their budgets to GAD. 

 
                         Table 46: Summary of ROs/POs that allocated at least five

38.6 We recommended and Management of the concerned Offices agreed 
to: 

 

a. direct the focal person to ensure correctness and timely 

submission and endorsement of GAD reports and strictly comply 

with the aforementioned provisions; 

 

b. allocate at least 5% of its annual budget for GAD programs and 

mainstream the GAD activities to maximize the budget allocation 

not only for the benefit of the employees/personnel but also the 

clients being served;  

 
c. establish and utilize sex-disaggregated data, together with survey 

results, as bases for identifying gender issues which could be used 

as input for planning GAD related activities to be mainstreamed 

in the programs of the agency; and  

 
d. conduct periodic monitoring and evaluation of GAD related 

activities to ensure fulfilment of its purpose. 

 



256 

 

38.7 The Management of the concerned Offices commented that non-
submission of GAD reports and non-compliance of the aforementioned 

provisions on GAD were due to various factors such as non-inclusion of 

GAD activities in the report, non-provision of approved GAD reports from 

its RO, lack of orientation/training on the matter and planned activities 

were not undertaken due to restrictions brought by the pandemic. 

Nevertheless, they already instructed the GAD focal person to implement 

the recommendations within the prescribed period. 
 

            Audit Team’s Rejoinder:  

 

38.8 Non-submission of the pertinent GAD reports to the Office of the Auditor 
within the reglementary period precluded the prompt evaluation and 

verification of its accomplishments relative to its GAD Plan and Budget 

 

Compliance with tax laws, rules and regulations 

 

39. TESDA CO, and 12 ROs have complied with the applicable BIR rules and 
regulations with regard to the withholding and prompt remittances of 

withheld taxes from suppliers/contractors of goods and services and from 

employee’s compensation. However, there were deficiencies/lapses observed 

in several OUs. 

 

39.1 Revenue Regulations No. 2-98 issued on May 17, 1998 prescribes the 
regulations to implement Republic Act (RA) No. 8424 relative to the 

Withholding on Income subject to the Expanded Withholding Tax and Final 

Withholding Tax, Withholding of Income Tax on Compensation, 

Withholding of Creditable Value-Added Tax and Other Percentage Taxes. 

 

39.2 Section 251 of the NIRC provides that failure of a Withholding Agent to 
Collect and Remit Tax. - Any person required to withhold, account for, and 

remit any tax imposed by this Code or who willfully fails to withhold such 

tax, or account for and remit such tax, or aids or abets in any manner to 

evade any such tax or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other 

penalties provided for under this Chapter, be liable upon conviction to a 

penalty equal to the total amount of the tax not withheld, or not accounted 

for and remitted. 

 

39.3 TESDA CO, and its ROs had substantially complied with Tax Laws 
requirement for CY2020 as taxes were withheld from the employee’s 

compensation, and from payments to suppliers and contractors and remitted 

the same to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). Details of the taxes 

withheld and remitted are shown in the table below:

39.5 We recommended that the TESDA concerned officers shall promptly 
remit the correct taxes withheld on a timely basis as prescribed in the 

provisions of BIR to avoid penalty pursuant to Section 251 of RA No. 

8424, and any penalty and interest imposed therein should be borne by 

the employee responsible in the withholding and remittance of taxes. 

 

39.6 The reason for non-remittance of some taxes was due to lack of manpower. 
However, the Management committed to strictly adhere with the provisions 

and guidelines in withholding and remittance of taxes. 

 
Compliance with GSIS Act of 1997 

 
40. The premiums/contributions and loan amortizations due to the GSIS were 

deducted/withheld from the monthly compensation of the employees for CY 



258 

 

2020 and were remitted together with the shares of the employer/government 

to the GSIS within the prescribed period pursuant to the Implementing Rules 

and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act (RA) No. 8291 or the GSIS Act of 1997. 

 

40.1 Section 5.c of RA No. 8291 dated May 30, 1997, otherwise known as “the 
GSIS Act of 1997” provides that xxx “It shall be mandatory and 

compulsory for all employers to include the payment of contributions in 

their annual appropriations. Penal sanctions shall be imposed upon 

employers who fail to include the payment of contributions in their annual 

appropriations or otherwise fail to remit the accurate/exact amount of 

contributions on time, or delay the remittance of premium contributions to 

the GSIS. The heads of offices and agencies shall be administratively liable 

for non-remittance or delayed remittance of premium contributions of the 

GSIS.” 

 

40.2 Section 7 of the same law states that “interests on Delayed Remittances. - 
Agencies which delay the remittance of any and all monies due the GSIS 

shall be charged interests as may be prescribed by the Board but not less 

than two percent simple interest per month. Such interest shall be paid by 

the employers concerned.” 

 

40.3 COA Circular No. 2004-008 dated September 20, 2004 defines the account 
Due to GSIS as contributions due/collections received/amounts withheld 

for remittance to the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS). 

 

40.4 The GSIS implemented a four-month moratorium from March to June 2020 
balances, thereby extended loan repayments through amortization pursuant 

to GSIS Memorandum Circular No. 015, series of 2020.  In addition, a 

Circular No. 2020-6 dated March 30, 2020 was issued which required the 

DBM to directly remit the government’s share in the RLIP contribution to 

the GSIS starting April 2020 to ensure that any benefit pay-outs by its 

members are fully provided.

43. Regions I, IV-A and XI have complied with the insurance of properties under 
the General Insurance Fund of GSIS in compliance with Section 5 of RA No. 

656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law. 

 

43.1 Section 5 of RA No. 656, provides that “Every government, except a 
municipal government below first class, is hereby required to insure its 

properties, with the Fund against any insurable risk herein provided and 



263

43.2 We recommended that the Management to continuously and strictly

Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability (PWDs) 

 

44. TESDA and various regions implemented programs and projects related to 
Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWD) through its TESDA 

learning system and curriculum in consonance with Section 32 of the General 

Provisions of the General Appropriations Act of FY 2020. However, there 

were deficiencies noted such as one percent threshold was not allocated to the 

programs, and projects related to SCs and Differently-abled persons. 

 

44.1 Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, otherwise known 
as the General Appropriations Act of 2020, provides that: 

 

Programs and Project related to Senior Citizens and Persons with 

Disability.  All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs 

and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and 

persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, 

and integrate the same in their regular activities. 

 

44.2 Provisions of Joint Circular No. 2003-01 dated April 28, 2003 of the DBM 
and DSWD are quoted below for ready reference: 

 

Section 4.2 – All government agencies, department, bureaus, offices, 

commissions and state universities and colleges shall allocate at least one 

(1) percent of their respective budget for the implementation of plans, 

programs, projects, activities and services for older persons with 

disabilities. 

 

Section 4.3 – The funds shall be utilized for the implementation of

44.3 The significant decrease in the number of beneficiaries catered during the 
year as compared to the accomplishments made on previous years is mainly 

attributable to the restrictions brought by the pandemic and series of 

lockdowns. Since the senior citizens and those with comorbidities are not 

yet allowed to go out of their homes and participate in different activities, 

the OUs were not able to encourage more PWDs and SCs to join the 

different programs and trainings conducted. 

 

44.4 Deficiencies noted in the implementation of the programs and projects 
intended for Senior Citizens and PWDs are as follows:

Region Deficiency in the Receivables – Disallowance/Charges Amount 
VI-

NOPO 

Disallowed CNA from former employees who have already retired, 

resigned, deceased and transferred to another region 

114,100.00 

VIII Disallowed receivables remained outstanding for more than a year 

to 14 years from former employees who have already retired, 

resigned and terminated. Others are still connected with the agency.  

346,505.10 

 

45.5 The continuous inaction in the enforcement of the settlement of these 
accounts will deprive the government of funds that should have been 

available for other government programs.  
 

45.6 We recommended, and Management of the CAR, Regions VI and VIII 
agreed, to enforce settlement of disallowances and charges from the 

persons determined liable, as indicated in the NDs issued, in 

accordance with the procedures under the RRSA prescribed under 

said COA Circular. 

 

45.7 The Management agreed and committed to comply with the 
recommendations. Demand letters will be sent to persons liable to impose 

settlements of disallowances and exert more effort to locate the 

whereabouts of those who are no longer connected with the office. 

 

45.8 At the TESDA CO, the Management takes cognizance on the Notice of 
Disallowance amounting to ₱82,255,555.64, which comprises nine (9) 

transactions were issued in 2008, 2009 and 2011. Of the nine (9) disallowed 

transactions, one (1) has a Supreme Court Decision promulgated dated 

March 11, 2014 where petition was denied. The other eight transactions 

were still appealed with COA in various dates.
