EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
  

A. Introduction 
 

By virtue of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7796, otherwise known as the Technical 

Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) Act of 1994, the TESDA was 

created on August 26, 1994. TESDA is mandated to provide accessible, high quality and 

efficient technical education and skills development in support of a high-quality Filipino 

middle-level manpower responsive to and in accordance with the Philippine Development 

Goals and Priorities. TESDA was created to mobilize the full participation of the industry, 

labor, technical and vocational institutions, local government and the civil society for 

skilled manpower development programs. 

 

The Agency’s mission is to provide direction, policies, programs and standards 

towards quality technical education and skills development, while its corporate vision is to 

be the leading partner in the development of the Filipino Work Force with world class 

competence and positive work values. 

 

The following are the functions and responsibilities, among others, of the TESDA: 

 

a. establish and maintain planning process and formulate a national technical 
education and skills development plan in which the member-agencies and other 

concerned entities of the Authority at various levels participate; 

 

b. provide analytical inputs to policy decision-making of the Authority on 
allocation of resources and institutional roles and responsibilities as shall be 

embodied in annual agencies technical education and skills development plans, 

in accordance with manpower plan for middle-level skilled workers as approved 

by the Authority; 

 

c. recommend measures, and implement the same upon approval by the Authority, 
for the effective and efficient implementation of the national technical education 

and skills development plan; 

 

 

d. propose to the Authority the specific allocation of resources for the programs 
and projects it shall undertake pursuant to approved national technical education 

and skills development plan; 

 

e. submit to the Authority periodic reports on the progress and accomplishment of 
work program of implementation of plans and policies for technical educational 

and skills development and prepare for approval by the Authority an annual 

report to the President on technical education and skills development; and 

 

f. enter into agreement to implement approved plans and programs and perform 
activities and shall implement the declared policy of the said Act. 



ii 

 

 The TESDA also needs to provide equitable access and provision of TESDA 

Education Skills Development (TESD) programs to the growing Technical Vocational 

Education and Training (TVET) clients.  Thus, it continues to undertake direct training 

provisions through four training modalities: a) School-based, b) Center-based, c) 

Enterprise-based and (d) Community-based. These are being done with TESDA’s 

infrastructure in place, namely: 57 TESDA administered schools, 60 training centers, 

enterprise-based training through Dual Training System (DTS)/apprenticeship and 

community-based training in convergence with the Local Government Units (LGUs). 

 

TESDA SUPPORTS TRAINING PROVISION 

 

• TESD creates opportunities for people to be responsible and become productive 
citizens. The need to provide and make accessible relevant TESD compels TESDA 

to undertake direct training activities at the same time support training activities 

undertaken by other key players in the TESD sector. 

 

• TESDA Technology Institutions (TTIs) are composed of 125 schools, regional, 
provincial and specialized training centers nationwide which undertake direct 

training activities for TESDA. The absence of an institution in the area which can 

provide people equitable access to TESD necessitates TESDA to undertake direct 

training activities. These TTIs also serve as venues to test new training schemes 

and are used as laboratories for new technology. 

 

Among TESDA’s specialized Training Centers are the following: 

 

a. TESDA Women’s Center (TWC) seeks to advance the economic status of 
women through training, entrepreneurship development, gender sensitive 

policies, programs and projects and research and advocacy. It was established 

through a grant from the Government of Japan. 

 

b. Language Skills Institute (LSI) serves as TESDA’s facility for language 
programs specifically for workers intending to work abroad. The LSI conducts 

training on workplace communication on the language of the country of the 

worker’s destination. There are 35 LSIs nationwide offering different language 

courses which include English, Korean, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese and 

Spanish. 

 

c. Korea-Philippines IT Training Centers (KPITTCs) are grant-assisted projects 
from the Government of the Republic of Korea. These KPITTCs are located at 

the Quezon City Polytechnic University in Novaliches, Quezon City and at the 

Regional Skills Development Centers in Guiguinto, Bulacan and Tibungco, 

Davao City, respectively.

and Revolving Fund - Sariling Sikap Program (SSP). In the 2020 GAA Agency Special 

Provisions, TESDA was authorized to:  (a) engage in various training cum-production, all 

income derived from these activities shall be deposited in the SSP account;  (b) develop 

the capability of LGUs to assume ultimately the responsibility for effectively providing 

community-based technical education and skills development opportunities; and (c) 

manage/administer the TESDA Development Fund (TDF) authorized under RA No. 7796, 

the income from which shall be utilized exclusively in awarding of grants and providing 

assistance to training institutions, industries, LGUs and implement training and training-

related activities. 

 

D. Scope of Audit 
 

 The audit covered the review of the accounts and operations of the TESDA Central 

Office, Regional Offices (ROs) and Provincial/District Offices for the year ended 

December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of assurance that may 

be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the 

propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules 

and regulations; and (c) determine the extent of implementations of prior years’ audit 

recommendations. 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report 
 

A qualified opinion was rendered on the fairness of presentation of the Financial 

Statement of the TESDA as at December 31, 2020 due to an aggregate misstatement 

totaling ₱371,257,713.14 as presented in the Independent Auditor’s Report discussed in 

Part II-Observations and Recommendations of this Report. 
 



vii 

 

Emphasis of Matter draw attention to a) Note 4 of the Notes to Financial Statements 

referring to  Prior Period Adjustments amounting to  ₱489,535,306.33 for CY 2020 and 

₱68,839,013.01 for CY 2019 due to unrecorded income and/or expenses,  reclassification 

of Assets that were previously recorded as Property, Plant and Equipment account instead 

of Inventories or Expenses accounts during the period, and the reversion of unexpended 

balances of Cash-Modified Disbursement System  (MDS) accounts,  however, without 

specific details of  the amount for adjustment  per   affected account  and without restating 

the balances thereof in the Financial Statements for CY 2019, hence the accuracy of the 

reduction in the  Equity account is doubtful; and b) the unauthorized retention of unutilized 

scholarship funds at the Provincial and District Offices reported in the Cash in Bank –Local 

Currency, Current accounts amounting to ₱356,387,118.82 gives misleading information 

that these funds are covered by a valid commitments or obligations on the part of the 

government where in fact these are already due for reversion/return to the National 

Treasury and an appropriate adjustment to the Accumulated Surplus (Deficit) of the 

concerned Offices. Our opinion is not unqualified in respect of these matters. 
 

 

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations   
 

The following are the Audit Team’s significant audit observations and the 

corresponding recommendations, which are discussed in detail in Part II of the Report.  

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 
 

1. Financial audit conducted on the accounts and operations of TESDA disclosed that the 
year-end consolidated financial statements (FS) of the Agency for Calendar Year (CY) 

2020 were misstated by an aggregate absolute amount of ₱371,257,713.14 due to 

unadjusted accounting errors and omissions in the Central Office (CO) and 15 

Regional Offices (ROs). Moreover, six accounts under the Assets, Liabilities and 

Expenses categories with an aggregate balance of ₱2,576,281,789.20 are unreliable 

due to unaccounted discrepancies, accounting deficiencies and control lapses that 

affected the fair presentation of the year-end FS. (Audit Observation No. 1) 

 

1.1 Cash and Cash Equivalents account was understated by ₱5,851,275.26 due to 
unadjusted errors and omissions and other accounting deficiencies in ten (10)

We recommended that the Management require the concerned offices to: 

 

• review the transactions affecting the accounts with negative balances and 
effect necessary adjustments in the books; and 

 

• review the transactions and effect adjusting entries on Payable and/or 
Expenses/Accumulated Surplus/Deficit accounts to correct the balances

1.7 The Income Accounts of TESDA PO Leyte and Agusan Del Sur School of Arts

programs and prior years’ income recorded in the current year, thus caused 

overstatement to the recognized Accumulate Surplus/ (Deficit) for FY 2020 and 

affected the fairness of the financial statements of the Agency. (Audit

Compliance Audit 

 

2. The transfer of ₱5.71 billion funds   by ROs to  OUs for the implementation of the 
scholarship/training programs on the basis of approved Qualification Maps (QMs) 

only instead of their actual requirements, wherein the ₱1.23 billion and  ₱70.13 million  

from the current and  continuing appropriations, respectively,  released to the latter 

only  in December 2020,  manifests the intent to avoid the lapsing of Notices of Cash 

Allocation (NCAs) that  resulted  in the accumulation of unutilized/idle funds  in the 



xvii 

 

Cash-LCCA of  TESDA OUs nationwide in the aggregate amount of ₱5.21 billion at 

yearend and exposing these funds to risk of possible misappropriation or improper 

disposition due to absence of control and proper monitoring, circumventing Item 4.0 

of DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-12  dated November 21, 2013. (Audit Observation 

No. 15) 

 

       We recommended that TESDA CO direct/instruct the:  

 

• ROs to transfer funds to OUs not only based on the approved QMs but also 
in accordance with their actual requirements and the reported actual Due 

and Demandable Accounts to prevent the accumulation of funds at the OUs. 

 

• ROs to comply strictly with DBM guidelines on the incurrence of obligation, 
utilization of NCAs, and validity of appropriation; and 

 

• ROs to closely monitor unutilized cash subsidy already due for 
return/reversion to the National Treasury but still retain at the OUs. 

 

3. TESDA reported in its Financial Accountability Report (FAR) a 96 percent obligation 
rate of the total allotments transferred to the ROs of P768,553,945.45, out of the ₱950 

million allotments for the Bayanihan 2 and disbursement rate of 66 percent thereof, 

which, however, does not match with  the Physical Accomplishments for CY 2020 

submitted by the Scholarship Management Division (SMD), which reported the 

number of scholars enrolled of only 33,555 or 59 percent of the total allocated training 

slots of 57,000, with actual number of graduates of 3,139 or nine percent of the total 

number of scholars enrolled. Such disparities are attributed to the practice of the ROs 

to immediately obligate and transfer to OUs all scholarship allocation based only on 

the approved QMs and report the same as utilized/disbursed upon release thereof. 

(Audit Observation No. 16) 

 

Although the program implementation was extended up to June 30, 2021, the actual 

full utilization of the funds and realization of the objective of the program for the 

retooling, retraining and upskilling of the target beneficiaries may not be attained since 

the  release of funds to ROs was not based on the actual needs or the expected number 

of targeted beneficiaries per district/region but on the budget allocation  per 

Congressional District, and in view of the fact that the Recovery Intervention Program 

also pertains to conduct of  scholarship trainings which is directly affected by 

quarantine restrictions and lockdowns imposed by the government due to COVID-19 

outbreak.  

 

Other deficiencies were also observed in the procedures/process at the     CO, ROs and 

OUs in the implementation of the program under the Bayanihan 2. (Audit Observation 

No. 2) 

 

 



xviii 

 

        We recommended that Management: 

 

• direct the Offices involved in the processing to properly coordinate and 
observe timelines; 

 

• streamline the processing time of the concerned Offices to expedite the 
release of funds to ROs/POs with approved Regional Qualification Maps 

(RQMs); 

 

• be more prudent and objective in the determination of beneficiaries and in 
the allocation of scholarship funds, to provide equitable distribution of 

scholarship allocations based on the recommended distribution per sector 

and per target client including the target number of beneficiaries per 

sector and per priority client, and to observe the standard procedures of 

identifying TVIs; and 

 

• instruct the ROs to release fund to DOs/POs based only on reported actual 
Due and Demandable Accounts. 

 

4. Fund transfers through Notice of Transfer Allocation (NTA) from TESDA CO to 
TESDA ROs for the implementation of EO No. 70, creating the National Task Force 

to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC), amounting to 

₱160,083,401.61 are highly questionable for lack of proper authority/legal basis and 

the absence of appropriate guidelines as to how this fund shall be utilized, likewise 

exposing these funds to possible misuse or misappropriation. (Audit Observation No. 

17) 

 

We recommended that Management should provide authority/legal basis for the 

fund transfers to ROs for the implementation of E.O. 70, creating the NTF-

ELCAC of ₱160,083,401.61 and the related implementing guidelines, for this may 

be a ground for Technical Malversation of Public Funds. 

 

5. Fund transfers to ROs as fund augmentation for various purposes amounting to 
₱39,954,475.202 contravene the rules on fund augmentation provided under the GAA 

of FY 2020 and Section 4 of PD No. 1445 on the prohibition on payment without valid 

appropriation or law allowing the same. (Audit Observation No. 18) 

 

We recommended that Management provides authority or basis for the grant of 

fund augmentation to ROs and explain why this should not be considered as 

Technical Malversation of Public Funds and be disallowed in audit. 
 

6. Fund transfers to TESDA RO - Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (TESDA-
ARMM) now changed to Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao 

(BARMM) were not covered by a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), and for CY 

2020 a total amount ₱62,364,533.60 was also allotted and obligated for transfer for the 

conduct of various trainings despite existing outstanding/unliquidated balance of 



xix 

 

₱42,398,983.10.  Moreover, the Audit Team of RO IX reported unutilized Scholarship 

Funds allocated for BARMM amounting to ₱19,412,917.22, which are already due for 

reversion due to lapsed validity period to utilize. (Audit Observation No. 19) 

 

       We recommended that Management should: 

 

• explain why fund transfer to TESDA-ARMM was not covered by a MOA; 
and why 2019 scholarship funds were released to RO IX when BARMM is 

considered as an independent RO; and 

 

• avoid further grant of fund transfer if the previous grants are not yet fully 
liquidated or settled. 

 

7. More than ₱2 billion of funds transferred to PITC in CY 2019 for the outsourced 
procurement, with validity period to utilize already lapsed pursuant to the FY 2019

nor reverted to the National Treasury, contrary NBC No. 578 and EO 91 series of 

2019.  (Audit Observation No. 20) 

 

We recommended that Management to render proper accounting of all fund 

transfer now due for reversion/deposit to the National Treasury and to 

immediately advise the PITC to deposit directly the unutilized funds providing 

TESDA with the necessary documents for recording purposes. 

 

8. Unauthorized retention of unutilized scholarship funds and trust funds in seven ROs 
amounting to ₱356,387,118.82, which should have been returned to the National 

Treasury exposes these funds to risk of possible misappropriation and likewise, 

deprives the government from utilizing the funds for other urgent and priority projects. 

 

In RO IV-B, the amount to ₱21,573,113.93 unutilized CY 2018 UAQTEA-CHED

9. The CY 2020 reported total  budget program allocation of ₱8,233,736,000.00 and the 
overall utilization and disbursements which showed favorable results do not faithfully 

represent the actual results of the implementation of scholarship training programs 



xxi 

 

considering that a) the reported financial performance of  81.62 percent obligation and 

73.08 percent disbursement is comparatively high than the reported sub-optimal 

physical accomplishments of only 32.96 percent training slots utilized and completed 

and 46.73 percent targeted graduates produced during the  budget year due  to the 

COVID-19 outbreak; b) the obligation rate of 81.62 percent refers to the obligated  

fund transfers by ROs to the OUs but  remained unutilized by the latter. 

 

 Moreover, excess approved RQMs over budget allocation was observed in TESDA-

NCR that resulted in unfunded training courses of P59,509,021.97, which is 

inconsistent with the TESDA policy that the budget allocation should be based on the 

approved QMs and thus may lead to unauthorized incurrence of obligations. (Audit 

Observation No. 22) 

 

      The Audit Team recommended that Management: 

 

• stop the ROs practice of reporting fund transfer to OUs as 
obligation/utilization, instead release to OUs should be based on actual 

due and demandable accounts; 

 

• ensure a more reliable and accurate report of the result of program 
implementation;  

 

• segregate the Physical Accomplishment as to source of funding; and 
 

• monitor and ensure that the approval and release of Regional 
Qualification Maps shall serve as one of the obligational authorities of the 

DOs to incur obligations and must be within the limit of the 

appropriated/allotted fund/budget per program. 

 

10. Unfavorable outcomes in the implementation of Scholarship Programs in CO and 12  
ROs such as: a) non-procurement/late procurement of toolkits for CYs 2018, 2019 and 

2020  STEP and UAQTEA Programs resulted in non-provision of  toolkits to scholars 

b) National Certificate for Driving for 3,719 graduates not recognized by the Land 

Transportation Office (LTO); and  c) late releases/unpaid Allowances or Training 

Benefits totaling ₱45,434,568.70  and  other deficiencies hinder the attainment of the 

overall objective of the Scholarship Programs.  (Audit Observation No. 24)
