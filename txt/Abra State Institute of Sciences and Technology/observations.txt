PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





FINANCIAL AND COMPLIANCE



1)	The Cash and Cash Equivalents account was understated by P33,317,825.99 due to non-maintenance of subsidiary records and non-reconciliation of the books with the bank statements and the cashier’s records; thus, adjustments were not undertaken on a) unbooked fund transfers of P28,565,540.00, b) various errors/omissions aggregating P5,185,593.71 and c) prior year’s unadjusted amount of negative P433,307.72.



	1)	As of December 31, 2020, the reported balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents was P34,673,824.32.  However, reconciliation conducted by the audit team resulted in an audited balance of P67,991,650.31.  Details of the discrepancies are as follows:

	2)	Reconciliation conducted by the audit team revealed that the Cash, Collecting Officers account was overstated by P470,007.40 and the Cash in Bank account was understated by P33,787,833.39; thereby, the Cash and Cash Equivalents accounts was understated by a net amount of P33,317,825.99.



	3)	It was noted that the discrepancies were caused by unrecorded fund transfers credited to the trust fund bank account in the current year totaling P28,565,540.00, unadjusted errors/and omissions in the recording of prior year transactions with net amount of P5,185,593.71, and unaccounted difference of negative P433,307.72.  Details of the unaccounted difference is as follows:

	4)	It was revealed that the unaccounted difference as provided above was already incorporated in the Annual Audit Report for CY 2012; however, this remained unaccounted for and unrecorded to this date; thus, continue to affect the fair presentation of the account balances.



	5)	The Accounting Unit reasoned out that the reconciling items can not be effected due to lack of documents and that no ledgers or references were prepared in prior years.  It was however revealed that to this date, the accounting unit failed to prepare and maintain subsidiary ledgers of said accounts.



	6)	The non-maintenance of subsidiary ledgers and non-reconciliation of the accounts are contrary to Paragraph 7, Chapter II of the Revised Cash Examination Manual, prescribed in COA Memorandum No. 2013-004 dated July 9, 2013, which states that “an accountable officer shall maintain his cashbooks/CRR/CDR/ChDR, and such other records or their equivalents as may be prescribed by the agency’s operating procedures, and reconcile with the accounting records at least quarterly, unless the agency requires a more frequent reconciliation.”



	7)	Also, Section 7, Chapter 21, GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that the Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty days after receipt of the monthly bank statements to the COA Auditor with all the supporting documents and Journal Entry Vouchers.  Furthermore, Section 6, of the same Chapter states that the Chief Accountant shall prepare a JEV to recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the books of accounts.



	8)	Failure of the accounting unit to maintain the subsidiary ledgers that will facilitate the reconciliation of accounts resulted in material unreconciled amounts.  A sound internal control on cash requires prompt and correct recording of transactions to ensure that financial information are reliable and accurate at any given period.



	9)	We recommended and Management agreed that the Accounting Unit:



		1)	make the necessary adjusting entries to recognize the fund transfers credited to the Trust Fund bank account amounting to P28,565,540.00 and the reconciling items arising from various errors/omissions amounting to P5,185,593.71;



		2)	trace the prior years’ unaccounted difference amounting to negative P433,307.72 and make the necessary adjusting entries; and



		3)	prepare and maintain subsidiary ledgers which aid in monitoring and detecting errors/omissions on specific accounts.



2)	The Accounts Receivable and Loans Receivable accounts totaling P13,673,232.33, aged 1 to over 3 years, were unreliable due to the absence of subsidiary records and other reports to show the details/breakdowns of the accounts.  Furthermore, the recorded Allowance for Impairment – Accounts Receivable of P26,664.43 has been non-moving since CY 2011 while no allowance for impairment account was provided for loans receivable; hence, aggravating to the unreliability of the account balances.



	1)	Item 6.1 of the COA Circular No. 2016-005 provides that all government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due and demandable.



	2)	Item 7.1 of the same Circular states that “the Accountant shall conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis and validation of the existence of the receivables, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers, and determine the concerned debtors, accountable officers (Regular and Special Disbursing Officers, Collecting Officer, Cashiers) and the source and implementing government entities.”



	3)	Item 7.3 states that “the accountant shall prepare the necessary adjusting entry/ies for the recognition of the computed/determined impairment in accordance with the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards; Correction of inadvertent errors, or inaccurate calculation or computation; Reclassification of accounts; and Recovery/settlement of previously written off accounts.”



	4)	The financial statements of the agency disclosed Accounts Receivable and Loans Receivable account balances totaling P13,673,232.33 and Allowance for Impairment – Accounts Receivable amounting to P26,664.43 as of year-end while no impairment allowance account was provided for the loans receivable.  Based on the aging schedule submitted by the accounting unit, the said balances were over three years; thus, were already past due, however, there was no evidence that the agency have undertaken efforts to collect the past due accounts.  There were no recorded Demand Letters issued by management.  Details of the aging schedule are as follows:

	5)	It was further observed that the subsidiary ledgers of the accounts were not maintained by the accounting unit.  The non-maintenance of the subsidiary ledgers and other reference documents resulted in the non-monitoring of settlements and caused the accumulation of past due accounts.  The non-settlement of the said past due accounts, therefore, deprived the agency of additional funds to support its projects, programs and activities.



	6)	Query with management disclosed that the Accounts Receivable account is composed of the sales on account from various Income-Generating Programs (IGPs) and also include the tuition fees earned in the previous years prior to the free education program.  Also, loans receivable account includes the Agricultural Education – Republic of the Philippines European Economic Council (AGRED-RP ECC) Fund and Student Assistance Fund for Education (SAFE) Loan.



	7)	The audit team requested for the breakdown of the accounts receivable account; however, no details were provided except for the record of the current year collections of accounts receivable and partial collection of the loans receivable pertaining to the SAFE loans.  According to the accounting unit, there are no available records to support the AGRED loans recorded under loans receivable account.



	8)	It was also revealed that the recorded Allowance for Impairment-Accounts Receivable amounting to P26,664.43 has been non-moving since CY 2011 while the Loans Receivable account was not provided with allowance for impairment.  Management also admitted that no assessment was conducted to determine whether there is any objective evidence that these receivables are impaired.  The non-provision of allowance for impairment rendered the accounts unreliable.



	9)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



		1)	instruct the Accountant to intensify collection efforts by issuing demand letters to the defaulting borrowers and their co-makers and to maintain subsidiary ledgers to aid monitoring of settlements of the receivables; and



		2)	conduct an assessment of the collectability of Accounts Receivable to determine whether to adjust the Allowance for Impairment set in CY 2011 and for the Loans Receivable whether to provide an impairment allowance.



3)	Property Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts aggregating P819,968,236.23 as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to: a) non-maintenance of Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Cards (PPELC), Subsidiary Ledgers and Property Cards (PC) resulting in unreconciled PPE account balances between Report on Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) and accounting records amounting to P130,634,469.38; b) non-reclassification of semi-expendable property accounts amounting to P512,428.00; and c) unserviceable properties amounting to P5,482,659.00 that are still carried in the PPE accounts instead of Other Assets account.



A)	Unreconciled PPE balances totaling P130,634,469.38 –



	1)	Section 112 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 states that:



“Each government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations conformably with generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations.”



	2)	Pertinent portion of Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) provides that:



“The Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE including work and animals, livestock etc.  The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset.  For check and balance, the Property and Supply office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same.  The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting division/Unit.  They shall be reconciled with other property records like PAR.”



	3)	Verification of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account showed that balances reflected in the Statement of Financial Position and General Ledgers do not reconcile with the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment as of year-end.  The unreconciled balance totaling P130,634,469.38 is detailed as follows:

	4)	It was noted that Supply Unit failed to maintain Property Cards while the Accounting Unit failed to prepare and maintain the Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPEL) and subsidiary ledgers.  The non-maintenance of the said records affected the reliability of the RPCPPE submitted by the Supply Unit.



	5)	As provided in the GAM, the RPCPPE shall be used to report the physical count and condition of PPE by type as at a given date, including those which are unrecorded and those which could not be accounted for and it should show the balance of PPE per property cards and per count and the shortage/overage if any.  



	6)	Furthermore. Property Cards shall be used by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to record the description, acquisition, transfer, disposal, and other information about the PPE and it shall be kept for each class of PPE.  On the other hand, Property Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) shall be used for each class of PPE to record the acquisition, description, custody, estimated life, depreciation, impairment, disposal, transfer/adjustment, repair history and other information about the property.  It shall be kept and maintained by the Accounting Office/Unit.



	7)	The Accounting Unit reasoned out that the unreconciled amount of P130,634,469.38 stemmed from the beginning balances of the PPE accounts and admitted that reconciliation cannot be made due to unavailability of records pertaining to PPEs purchased in the prior years.



	8)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



		1)	require the Accounting Unit to reconcile the amount of P130,634,469.38 variance between the RPCPPE and the financial statements;



		2)	require the Accounting Unit to reconstruct the PPELC based on the latest RPCPPE and prepare subsidiary ledgers for each account to support the recorded PPE account balances on the financial statements; and



		3)	require the Supply Unit to prepare and maintain Property Cards (PCs) of all the PPE found during the physical count.



B)	Semi-expendable properties totaling P512,428.00 were classified as PPE accounts



	9)	Section 10, Chapter 8 of GAM Volume I provides:



“Sec. 10. Semi-expendable Property.  Tangible items below the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 shall be accounted as semi-expendable property.  The following policies apply as follows:



a)	Semi-expendable property which were recognized as PPE shall be reclassified to the affected accounts.

b)	These tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon issue to the end-user.



	10)	Analysis of the accounts and verification of inventory reports submitted by Lagangilang Campus disclosed that semi-expendable property totaling P512,428.00 with unit costs below the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 were still included in the Machinery and Equipment account.  However, the Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) on file showed that the said items were already issued to end-users; thus, these should have been expensed.



	11)	It should also be noted that instead of Property Acknowledgement Report (PAR), an Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) should be prepared to establish accountability over said semi-expendable property.

 

	12)	The Accountant reasoned out that the reclassification was not yet made due to time constraint and unavailability of records for those items purchased in the prior years.



	13)	We recommended and Management agreed that the Accountant reclassify the amount of P512,428.00 to semi-expendable property and adjust the corresponding Accumulated Depreciation accounts.



C)	Unserviceable properties totaling P5,482,659.00 were still carried in PPE accounts



	14)	Section 79 of P.D. 1445 states that “when the government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefor, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative xxx and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence.  If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder x x x.”



	15)	Test verification of the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) disclosed unserviceable properties with total cost of P5,482,659.00 that are still carried in the PPE accounts; thus, overstating the PPE account balances as of year-end.



	16)	It was also noted that unserviceable properties recorded in the IIRUP were still recorded in the RPCPPE as of year-end.  The Supply Unit reasoned out that they were not able to update the report of physical count due to time constraint.  The Supply Unit also admitted that they were not yet able to furnish the Accounting Unit copy of the report of unserviceable properties for disposal; thus, said properties were not reclassified.



	17)	We recommended that the Accounting Unit reclassify the unserviceable properties amounting to P5,482,659.00 from PPE accounts to Other Assets account.



	18)	We also recommended that the Supply Unit furnish the Accounting Unit copy of the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP), to serve as basis for reclassification of PPE accounts.



	19)	We further recommended that the unserviceable property be disposed of, following the provisions of Section 79 of PD 1445.



	20)	Management acknowledged the audit team observation and agreed with the recommendations.



4)	The total advances was overstated by P130,039.89 due to various accounting errors and omissions in the recording of liquidations; thus, affecting the fair presentation of the account in the financial statements as of year-end.



	1)	Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I provides that “financial statements (FSs) shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity.  Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses set out in PPSAS.”



	2)	Likewise, Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 states that “(1) the accounts of the agency shall be kept in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the time adequate to furnish the information needed by the fiscal or control agencies of the government. (2) the highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.



	3)	Audit disclosed that the total cash advances composed of the Advances for Operating Expenses, Advances for Payroll and Advances to Officers and Employees was overstated by net amount of P130,039.89.  Details are as follows:

	4)	It was noted that the net overstatement was due to various errors and omissions in the recording of liquidations.  Also, some of the reconciling items pertain to unaccounted differences of prior year transactions and have been incorporated in the prior year Annual Audit Report for CY 2012 but remained unaccounted and unadjusted to this date; thus, continue to affect the fair presentation of the account balances.



	5)	The audit team also noted various double recording of liquidations which resulted in the negative balances of the advances for operating expenses account.  These erroneous entries understated the account and rendered some unliquidated cash advances undetected.



	6)	Furthermore, it was noted that the accounting unit failed to maintain subsidiary ledger that would facilitate in the strict monitoring of cash advances and maintenance of accurate balances of accounts.



	7)	The Accountant reasoned out that they could not readily trace the unaccounted differences and effect the reconciling items due to lack of records specially those transactions pertaining to prior years.



	8)	We recommended that Management require the Accounting Unit to effect the adjustments of the identified errors in the books such as the double recording of liquidations, including the deficiencies in prior years which were not yet acted upon.



	9)	We also recommended that Management exert effort in the reconciliation of the total advances accounts and to maintain subsidiary ledgers which aid in monitoring and detecting of errors/omissions on specific accounts.



	10)	Management acknowledged the audit team observations and agreed with the recommendations.



5)	Delivered goods and services in CY 2019 were booked up only in CY 2020; resulting in the overstatement of the expense accounts by P775,035.00. 



	1)	Section 119 of PD 1445 provides that: “Accounting for obligations ad expenditures.  All lawful expenditures and obligations incurred during the year shall be taken up in the accounts of that year.”





	2)	Section 6 (b) of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies, Volume I prescribes the basic government accounting and budget reporting principles and stated that each entity shall recognize and present financial transactions and operations conformably to the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the PPSAS.  Furthermore, Section 2(a) of the same manual provides for the definition of accrual basis of accounting which states:



“a. Accrual basis – means a basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid).  Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate.  The elements recognized under accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue and expenses.”



	3)	Post-audit of disbursements revealed that various expenditures incurred in CY 2019 amounting to P1,780,187.96 were taken up as either expense or asset account in CY 2020 due to non-recording as Accounts Payable in CY 2019.  Verification showed that the transactions were valid obligations in the registries for CY 2019.  Also, the procured goods and services were already delivered by the suppliers and accepted by the agency in 2019.  However, the corresponding expense or asset accounts for these good/services were not recognized in 2019, instead these were taken up in September 2020 when payment was made.  This resulted in the overstatement of expense accounts.



	4)	We recommended that Management:



1)	require the Accountant to adjust the overstatement of the expense account by P775,035.00; and



2)	require the Accountant to set up the Accounts Payable account for goods or services in the period these were delivered.



	5)	Management agreed and promised to adhere with the audit recommendations.



6)	Advances to Officers and Employees amounting to P111,768.42 remained unliquidated as of year-end contrary to COA Circular 97-002.  Contributory to its non-liquidation and accumulation is the lack of monitoring by Management that includes preparation of aging reports and issuance of demand letters contrary to COA Circular 2012-004.



	1)	COA Circular 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides the amended rules and regulations on the grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances.  Items 5.7 and 5.8 thereof provides that when a cash advance is no longer needed or has been used for a period of two months, it must be returned immediately to the collecting officer.  All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of the year.  Except for petty cash fund, the Accountable Officer shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipt.



	2)	Audit revealed that as of year-end of CY 2020, advances to officers and employees account amounting to P111,768.42 remained unliquidated.  It should be noted that Advances to Officers and Employees account is used to recognize advances for official travels and as provided by existing rules and regulations, cash advances for travel shall be liquidated within 30 days after return to official station.  However, the said cash advances remained unliquidated for over one year and it was further verified that P42,418.38 of the outstanding balance pertains to cash advances granted prior to December 31, 2011 despite the issuance of COA Circular 2012 which served as demand for immediate liquidation of all cash advances outstanding as of December 31, 2011 on or before January 31, 2013.



	3)	Items 6 of COA Circular 2012-004 states:



“6.0 Final demand to settle unliquidated cash advance



Wherefore, final notice and demand is hereby made to all concerned to settle and liquidate all outstanding cash advances as of December 31, 2011 on or before January 31, 2013.  Provided, however, that those who have been issued by the Commission on Audit notice and demand, prior to the issuance of this Circular, to settle and liquidate their cash advances within a specific period, shall do so within the period specified in the said notice.



Xxx



This Circular shall serve as the demand required under appropriate law, rules and regulations to settle the accountable officer’s unliquidated cash advance as well as all those who are already separated from the service or have transferred to other agency.”

 

	4)	The continued existence of the long overdue unliquidated cash advances of officials and employees implies that management did not conduct a regular and sustained monitoring of the cash advances and the rules/limitation on the grant of cash advances was not strictly enforced.



	5)	Moreover, it was also revealed that the outstanding balance of P111,768.42 is a net amount which includes unliquidated cash advances of P262,693.00 and net of the recorded over liquidations totaling P150,924.58, detailed as follows:



Particulars

(150,924.58)

Total Unliquidated Advances to Officers and Employees as of 12/31/20



111,768.42



	6)	It was also noted that unliquidated cash advances of employees that were already separated from the service were still booked under the same account which remained non-moving for over 10 years.  Some accountable officers were also noted to have already passed away, thus, settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.  However, no request for write-off was submitted by the Agency.





	7)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



		1)	cause the periodic preparation of aging reports for monitoring purposes to prevent the accumulation of unliquidated cash advances;



		2)	issue demand letters to all accountable officers with unliquidated cash advances including those no longer connected with the agency; 



		3)	cause the withholding of any claims by officials and employees with unliquidated cash advances who are still in the service until they shall have complied with the demand; and



		4)	request for authority to write-off dormant unliquidated cash advances to the Commission on Audit following strictly the procedures prescribed under COA Circular 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



7)	The practice of paying salaries and wages of employees even without the accomplished Daily Time Records for a period of one month to four months was in violation of Section 2, Rule XVII of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292.



	1)	Section 2, Rule XVII of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292 (Administrative Code of 1987), states that: “Each head of department or agency shall require a daily time record of attendance of all the officers and employees under him including those serving in the field, or on the water, to be kept on the proper form and, whenever possible, registered on the bundy clock.”



	2)	The Civil Service Commission (CSC) has prescribed CSC Form No. 48 as the Daily Time Record (DTR) for government employees to be prepared/submitted at the end of each month.  The form carries a certification from the employee that the DTR is a true and correct report of the hours of work performed, record of which were made daily at the time of arrival and departure from Office.  The DTR shall be attested by the Department Head or In-Charge.  The form contains the following columns: Time of Arrival and Departure in the morning:  Time of Arrival and Departure in the afternoon, and Undertimes in Hours and Minutes per day.



	3)	Post-audit of the disbursement vouchers for the general payroll for the period January 1 to December 31, 2020 revealed that disbursements for salaries and wages amounting to P1,631,780.00 were paid without the accomplished Daily Time Records of twenty-one employees.  It was also noted that the salaries and wages of employees were not supported with either photocopies of logbook or Employee’s Attendance Records as generated by biometric system.



	4)	Verification of the Worksheet and Report of Service prepared by the Human Resource Management Office (HRMO) showed that the Daily Time Records not submitted ranged from one month to maximum of four months.  It was noted that despite the habitual non-preparation and non-submission of DTRs for more than two months, the names of those employees were not dropped from the payroll and continued to receive their monthly salaries and wages.



	5)	The management claimed that they exerted efforts to remind the employees of their obligation to submit their Daily Time Records on a monthly basis.  The management submitted photocopies of the memoranda dated October 2, 2020 issued to four employees requiring them to submit their Daily Time Records.  However, the issuance of the memoranda seems late considering that the memoranda were issued on October 2, 2020 and the Daily Time Records being requested are for the period March to August 2020.    



	6)	A complaint was filed by a concerned employee on October 22, 2020 to the Civil Service Commission and was later forwarded to the Audit Team on various allegations enumerated as follows:



“a. Concerned management officials tolerate habitual late/non-submission of Daily Time Records (DTRs);



“b. Giving of salary even without accomplished DTR; and



“c. The policy on the use of log book as basis in accomplishing DTR is selective.”



	7)	The first and second allegations have been sufficiently proven as shown by the results of the audit of the submitted documents. However, the verification of the third allegation is considered a management function since the DTRs submitted to the Audit Team bore the signatures of respective officials in charge.  It is respectfully reminded that active monitoring and prompt action of management to those who fail to comply with the regulations would discourage employees from committing the same.



	8)	We recommended and Management agreed to –



		1)	strictly monitor the preparation and submission of Daily Time Records of all officials and employees on a monthly basis as prescribed under Section 2, Rule XVII of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292 to avoid suspension or disallowance in audit; and



		2)	drop from the payroll the names of all officers and employees who will incur late/non-submission of their Daily Time Records for more than two months until these shall have been complied with.







8)	Advance payments for two projects attributed to Gender and Development (GAD) were paid without the requisite bank guarantee, or, surety bond, while progress payments were not subjected to retention money of ten percent totaling P1,669,585.13, contrary to the Annex E of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act (R.A.) 9184 on Contract Implementation Guidelines for the Procurement of Infrastructure Project; thus, the interest of the procuring entity was not protected.



	1)	Section 4.2 of the Annex E of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act (R.A) 9184 provides that, “the advance payment shall be made only upon the submission to and acceptance by the procuring entity of an irrevocable standby letter of credit of equivalent value from a commercial bank, a bank guarantee or a surety bond callable upon demand, issued by a surety or insurance company duly licensed by the Insurance Commission and confirmed by the procuring entity.”



	2)	Furthermore, Section 6 of the same Annex, provides that:



“6. RETENTION MONEY



6.1 Progress payments are subject to retention of ten percent (10%) referred to as the “retention money.”  Such retention shall be based on the total amount due to the contractor prior to any deduction and shall be retained from every progress payment until fifty percent (50%) of the value of works, as determined by the procuring entity, are completed.  If, after fifty percent (50%) completion, the work is satisfactorily done and on schedule, no additional retention shall be made; otherwise, the ten percent (10%) retention shall be imposed.”



6.2 The total “retention money” shall be due for release upon final acceptance of the works.  The contractor may, however, request the substitution of the retention money for each progress billing with irrevocable standby letter of credit or from a commercial bank, bank guarantees or surety bonds callable on demand, of amounts equivalent to the retention money substituted for and acceptable to Government, provided that the project is on schedule and is satisfactorily undertaken.  Otherwise, the ten percent (10%) retention shall be made.  Said irrevocable standby letter of credit, bank guarantees and/or surety bonds, to be posted in favor of the Government shall be valid for a duration to be determined by the concerned implementing office/agency or procuring entity and will answer for the purpose for which the ten percent (10%) retention is intended, i.e., to cover uncorrected discovered defects and third party liabilities.”



	3)	Post-audit of the infrastructure projects attributed to Gender and Development (GAD) disclosed that advance payments were paid without the requisite bank guarantee instrument while progress payments were not subjected to retention of ten percent, which was contrary to the above-cited rules and regulations.  The projects include the Construction of 3-storey Girls Dormitory Building and Upgrading of Central Agriculture Laboratory Building, both located at the main campus. The payments made by the agency are detailed as follows:

	4)	It was noted that the total retention money that was not deducted from progress payments of the two projects amounted to P1,669,585.13.  Review of the submitted documents also disclosed that there were no irrevocable standby letters of credit from a commercial bank, bank guarantees or surety bonds callable on demand, of amounts equivalent to the retention money to serve as substitute thereof.  



	5)	We recommended that Management deduct ten percent of the total contract prices from the final payment as retention money and which shall be released to contractors only upon final acceptance of the work as prescribed under Section 6 of Annex E of the Revised IRR of RA 9184.



	6)	We further recommended that Management adhere with the laws, rules and regulations as provided under the Revised IRR of the R.A. 9184 for future infrastructure projects; among others, to require contractors to provide bank guarantee or surety bonds for any advance payments claimed and to deduct retention money from progress payments or to require bank guarantee as substitute thereof.



	7)	Management was amenable and agreed to adhere with the recommendations.



9)	The benefits of the Student Assistance Fund for Education (SAFE) for Loan program were not maximized due to the following practices of the agency: a) loans amounting to P443,670.00 were granted to non-qualified students who are in their first year of study, contrary to CHED Memorandum Order No. 25, series of 2008 prescribing the guidelines for the implementation of the program; and b) loans granted aging five to 13 years totaling P679,382.00 remained uncollected as of year-end.



	1)	Items 1 and 3 of the CHED Memorandum Order No. 25, series of 2008 states that the Student Assistance Fund for Education for Loan (SAFE Loan) program will play a major role in increasing the number of students who are able to complete their courses and graduate from the various colleges and universities in the country, which development is crucial for maintaining a strong and vibrant Philippine economy.  It shall cater to financially needy students who are in their 3rd, 4th, 5th or graduating year of study.  Priority shall be given to those enrolled in CHED Priority Courses.  The loan grant can be used for tuition and other school fees, books and course projects, thesis writing, boarding and lodging, graduation fees, and other valid related education expenses.



	2)	Item 6 of the same memorandum order also provides that qualified loan grantees can borrow as much as Eight Thousand Pesos depending on individual circumstances and requirements.



	3)	Audit of the SAFE Loan program revealed that the agency was not able to strictly screen the applicants in accordance with the set criteria.  It was noted that loans amounting to P443,670.00 were granted to students who are in their first year of study, thus, qualified students who are in their 3rd, 4th, 5th or graduating years of study were deprived of the opportunity to avail of the loan program.



	4)	Furthermore, it was noted that loans receivables of the agency totaling P679,382.00 remained uncollected and are already past due as of year-end.  Details of the age of the SAFE loan receivables are as follows:



Current

Past Due

Over 3 to 4 years

34,500.00

109,482.00

1,565,202.00

















	5)	The SAFE loan fund is an interest-free loan granted to students and is payable within two to five years after graduation as provided in the CHED Memorandum Order.  The duly notarized promissory note executed by both the student-borrower and the co-maker, who serves as the guarantor, provides that the loan granted shall be paid in four equal installments of P2,000.00 every six months in the span of two years.  The loan agreement stipulates that in the event that the student-borrower fails to settle his/her obligation, the co-maker will be responsible for the full payment of the same within the period set by the agency.



	6)	Review of the monthly collections submitted by the SAFE Committee in-charge showed that the terms of payments agreed upon in the loan agreement form were not strictly enforced.  Salary deductions from employees who served as guarantors are being implemented for some of the past due accounts, however, the audit team cannot verify the details of the past due accounts being paid by the the co-makers due to non-maintenance of subsidiary ledger cards of student-borrowers.  It should also be noted that some employees have signed as co-makers of more than three students.



	7)	Despite the accumulation of past due accounts, no demand letters were issued to the student-borrowers and co-makers.  It was further observed that the status of enrolment of the student-borrowers were not strictly monitored.  Based on the data provided, the past due accounts had been granted in 2008 to 2018, thus, it was probable that the student-borrower have already completed their studies as of the current year.  If these past due accounts are collected, the funds could again be used to cater more qualified students who are currently enrolled.



	8)	The non-collection of the said past due accounts limit the benefits of the SAFE program that is intended to reach more students who are in need of financial assistance.



	9)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



		1)	require the SAFE Loan Committee in-charge to screen and accept applicants in accordance with set criteria as provided in CHED Memorandum Order No. 25, series 2008 which is to grant loans to students who are in their 3rd, 4th, 5th or graduating year of study;



		2)	require the SAFE Loan Committee to monitor the status of enrolment of each student-borrowers; and



		3)	require the Accountant to issue demand letters to the defaulting student-borrowers and their co-makers and maintain subsidiary ledger cards of student-borrowers to aid in monitoring outstanding balances.



10)	The Waste Materials Report (WMR) was not used to report damaged/destroyed materials that have been replaced; thus, there was no assurance that materials previously taken up in the books of accounts as assets have been properly disposed of and derecognized from the books.



	1)	Appendix 65 of the GAM Volume II prescribes the use of the WMR. As described therein, “The WMR shall be used by the Supply and/or Property Custodian to report all waste materials previously taken up in the books of accounts as assets or in his/her custody so that they may be properly disposed of and derecognized from the books.”



	2)	Post-audit of the disbursement vouchers revealed that Waste Materials Report (WMR) was not prepared for purchased materials amounting to P213,323.40 to replace the damaged or destroyed parts.  The Supply Officer admitted that only Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) and Pre-inspection and Post-inspection Reports were being prepared every time the agency purchases spare parts.



	3)	It should be noted that damaged parts that have been replaced should be turned-over to the Supply Officer for safekeeping and proper disposal and the WMR is a necessary control to monitor that this is properly implemented.  Furthermore, it is reminded that Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) do not serve as a replacement for the WMR.  The RIS is used by the Requisitioning Division/Office to request supplies/goods/equipment/property carried in stocks by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to issue the items requested and is not used for the monitoring of replaced parts.



	4)	Therefore, the non-preparation of WMR resulted in the inability of Management to monitor the safekeeping and proper disposal of the damaged/destroyed parts being replaced.  Also, waste materials previously taken up as assets were not properly derecognized from the books of accounts.



	5)	We recommended that management require the preparation of Waste Materials Report (WMR) for every replacement of parts/accessories and require concerned personnel to turn over the replaced parts to the Supply Officer for safekeeping and proper disposal.  



	6)	We also recommended that Management require the Accounting Unit to derecognize from the books all waste materials previously taken up in the books of accounts as assets upon proper disposal thereof.



	7)	Management agreed and promised to adhere with the audit recommendations.



1)	The Supply Officer did not use Inventory Tag/Stickers on issued property to end users from 2018 to 2020 as an effective methodical system of inventory; thus, properties could not be readily identified and cross-referencing to the Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) and other records was not facilitated.



	1)	Section 3 of the COA Circular No. 80-124 discusses the responsibility and accountability of the head of agencies in the inventory of fixed assets.  It states that the head of the agency shall exercise the diligence of a good father of a family in supervising accountable officers under his control to prevent the incurrence of loss of government property, otherwise he shall be jointly and solidarily liable with persons primarily accountable therefore.



	2)	Furthermore, Section 5.2 of the same Circular states the rules on Property Identification and Coding, as follows: “Government property shall be properly labelled and identified by the Inventory Committee.  Inventory labels of special materials shall contain among others the individual property number to be provided by the corporation concerned.  These numbers shall be uniformly printed in India Ink, to achieve permanence and best results, and shall be posted on a prominent but secure portion of the property for easy identification.



	3)	During the partial inventory-taking, wherein the audit team checked on the existence of the fixed assets purchased in the years 2018 to 2020, it was found out that the purchased fixed assets do not have inventory tag/stickers on them, thus, the said fixed assets cannot be readily identified.  It should be emphasized that various fixed assets purchased include televisions, computer sets and laptops that are identical to each other and the properties cannot be readily identified and cross-referenced to the Property Acknowledgement Receipt.



	4)	The Inventory Tag/Sticker should be attached to the fixed assets before these are issued to the end-user with the basic information as follows:



--	Name of Agency

--	Property Number

--	Name of Department/Office

--	Article and Description

--	Amount/Acquisition Cost 

--	Date Acquired

--	Location

--	Count Date

--	Signature of Office Representative

--	Signature of GSO Representative



	5)	The Supply Officer reasoned out that their office lacks manpower to strictly implement the property tagging, however, he promised to comply this year.



	6)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Supply Officer to use Inventory Tag/Sticker on all old and newly acquired property as an effective control on the proper use of government property and to facilitate the conduct of inventory.  



2)	The Report on Monthly Fuel Consumption of government vehicles was not prepared and submitted to COA as required under COA Circular No. 77-61 dated September 26, 1977 and the driver’s trip tickets were not properly filled up; thus, the reasonableness of gasoline expenses amounting to P339,116.03 could not be ascertained.



	1)	Pursuant to COA Circular No. 77-61 dated September 26, 1977, the use of government motor vehicles should be controlled through properly accomplished and duly approved Driver’s Trip Tickets which should be made at the end of the month in a Monthly Report of Official Travels, for audit purposes.  Likewise, Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption of government motor transportation shall be prepared and submitted to the Auditor for verification purposes to determine the reasonableness of fuel consumed during the period



	2)	Post-audit of the disbursement vouchers disclosed that the agency incurred gasoline expenses for the year totaling P339,116.03.  Examination of the driver’s trip tickets revealed that the trip tickets were not properly filled up as to the fuel beginning balance, fuel usage/purchase and fuel ending balance, time or departure and arrival.  These informations must be accomplished by the driver after the end of trip.



	3)	Furthermore, the Monthly Fuel Consumption Report of the agency’s vehicles was not prepared and submitted to the audit team.  It should be noted that the non-preparation of the report will preclude the management and audit team in determining the reasonableness of the reported fuel consumption.  



	4)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



		1)	assign an employee to prepare the Monthly Fuel Consumption Report of vehicles owned by the agency and submit the report to COA for verification; and



		2)	require drivers to fill up properly all trip tickets indicating therein the plate number of the vehicle, destination, purpose, passenger, quantity of fuel loaded to the vehicle, time of departure and arrival from the trip and to submit all copies of the trip tickets to the assigned employee for the preparation of the Monthly Fuel Consumption Report.



GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT



11)	The GAD Plan and Budget totaling P22,769,172.72 of the agency is compliant with the five percent of the total appropriations, minimum requirement.  However, only P14,382,005.51 or 63 percent of the total budget was utilized; hence, some identified GAD issues were not addressed.



	1)		Item 6.1 of PCW, NEDA, and DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 states, “At least five percent (5%) of the total agency budget appropriations authorized under the annual GAA shall correspond to activities supporting GAD plans and programs.

	

	2)		Review of the agency’s GAD Plan and Budget disclosed that the agency budgeted P22,769,172.72 or 10 percent of their total appropriations authorized under GAA for the year totaling P224,797,000.00.  However, review of the agency’s accomplishment report revealed that only P14,382,005.51 or 63 percent of the total budget was utilized.  Details of the GPB and accomplishment report, are as follows:

	3)		The GPB of the agency is compliant with the five percent of total appropriations minimum requirement, however, some of the GAD issues identified were not addressed due to its non-implementation.  The GAD focal person reasoned out that some of the activities did not push through because of the restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.  It was noted that some of the unimplemented activities include seminars and training for the students.



	1)	We recommended that Management continue their compliance on allotting at least five percent of the total appropriations authorized in their annual GAA and implement all identified GAD projects and activities in the GPB.



	2)	We also recommended that Management include in their plan alternative methods of conducting GAD seminars and trainings for the students and employees during the pandemic such as webinars or other remote learning methods.  



	3)	Management agreed and promised to adhere with the audit recommendations.





Compliance with Tax Laws



12)	In CY 2020, Management remitted taxes withheld from salaries and benefits of employees, purchases of materials and services, contract and other related procurements to the Bureau of Internal Revenue amounting to P15,537,795.38.

	1)	The unsettled disallowance of P759,423.05 was not appealed within the six months period; hence, these had become final and executory. 



	1)	There are no NDs covered by COA Regional Office Decision for automatic review or Petition for Review by the Commission Proper.  There are also no NDs covered by a COA Decision or Petition for Certiorari with the Supreme Court.



	4)	We recommended and Management agreed to cause the immediate settlement of the remaining disallowances totaling Ᵽ759,423.05 in accordance with Section 7.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 or the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts.



VALUE FOR MONEY AUDIT



6)	Seven production centers of the Income Generating Projects (IGPs) of the agency earned a total income of P662,046.00. However, two of the projects incurred a total loss of P426,095.34; thus, the objective of income generation was not fully attained. Also, validation of actual production, sales and inventory could not be undertaken due to absence of data such as quantity and unit price; hence, there was no proper monitoring of projects.



	1)	The Productions and IGPs Department of the agency is currently maintaining nine projects that include the piggery, ranch, poultry, acqua-culture, orchard, rice, corn, registered seed and high value crop project.  As of year-end, sales, production cost and net income for each project are, as follows:

	2)	It was noted that the poultry and rice projects incurred a total loss of P426,095.34 while the eight other projects accumulated a total income of P662,046.00, resulting in total net income of P235,950.66.  



	3)	Data provides that under the poultry and rice projects, the agency have been incurring more expenses than gaining an income.  Post-audit of the expenses incurred for the IGPs disclosed that most of the expenses incurred were for the purchase of supplies necessary for the production and payment of salaries and wages for the employees assigned in the IGP department.



	4)	However, review of the collections that are the basis of the IGPs income disclosed that details of the sales for each project such as the quantity and price of the products were not properly indicated, thus, the outflow of inventory was not properly monitored, which also affected accuracy of sales recorded.  Also, details of the actual produce/harvest were not provided, thus, the production for the year cannot be verified against that of the total sales.



	5)	It was also noted that policies on the pricing, productions and sales monitoring were not included in the IGP Manual.



	6)	Absence of such basic internal control measures affects the performance of the projects and limits the full potential of an IGP to deliver maximum profit to the agency.



	7)	We recommended that Management immediately require all Project Managers to prepare periodic reports such as Production Report, Sales Report and Inventory Report, among others, complete with data as to quantity, unit price and other information that would facilitate monitoring of actual production, sales and inventory.



	8)	We also recommended that Management adopt policies on pricing, production and sales monitoring and other control measures which shall be incorporated in the IGP Manual to maximize the potential of an IGP to generate income for the agency.



	9)	Management agreed and promised to adhere with the audit recommendations.
