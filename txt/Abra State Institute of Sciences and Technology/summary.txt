C)	Opinion of the Auditor on the Fairness of Presentation of the Financial Statements



We rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements because of the following:



1)	The Cash and Cash Equivalents  account was understated by P33,317,825.99 due to non-maintenance of subsidiary records and non-reconciliation of the  books with the bank statements and the cashier’s records; thus,  adjustments were not undertaken on a) unbooked fund transfers of P28,565,540.00, b) various errors/omissions aggregating P5,185,593.71 and c) prior years’ unadjusted amount of negative P433,307.72.



2)	The Accounts Receivable and Loans Receivable accounts totaling P13,673,232.33, aged 1 to over 3 years, were unreliable due to the absence of subsidiary records and other reports to show the details/breakdowns of the accounts.  Furthermore, the recorded Allowance for Impairment – Accounts Receivable of P26,664.43 has been non-moving since CY 2011 while no allowance for impairment account was provided for loans receivable; hence, aggravating to the unreliability of the account balances.



3)	Property Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts aggregating P819,968,236.23 as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to: a) non-maintenance of Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Cards (PPELC), Subsidiary Ledgers and Property Cards (PC) resulting in unreconciled PPE account balances between Report on Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) and accounting records amounting to P130,634,469.38; b) non-reclassification of semi-expendable property accounts amounting to P512,428.00; and c) unserviceable properties amounting to P5,482,659.00 that are still carried in the PPE accounts instead of Other Assets account.



4)	The total advances was overstated by P130,039.89 due to various accounting errors and omissions in the recording of liquidations; thus, affecting the fair presentation of the account in the financial statements as of year-end.



5)	Delivered goods and services in CY 2019 were booked up only in CY 2020; resulting in the overstatement of the expense accounts by P775,035.00.



D)	Significant Observations and Recommendations



Other than the bases for the qualified opinion, following are some of the significant observations and recommendations:



1)	Advances to Officers and Employees amounting to P111,768.41 remained unliquidated as of year-end contrary to COA Circular 97-002.  Contributory to its non-liquidation and accumulation is the lack of monitoring by Management that includes preparation of aging reports and issuance of demand letters contrary to COA Circular 2012-004.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



--	cause the periodic preparation of aging reports for monitoring purposes to prevent the accumulation of unliquidated cash advances;



--	issue demand letters to all accountable officers with unliquidated cash advances including those no longer connected with the agency; 



--	cause the withholding of any claims by officials and employees with unliquidated cash advances who are still in the service until they shall have complied with the demand; and



--	request for authority to write-off dormant unliquidated cash advances to the Commission on Audit following strictly the procedures prescribed under COA Circular 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



2)	The practice of paying salaries and wages of employees even without the accomplished Daily Time Records for a period of one month to four months was in violation of Section 2, Rule XVII of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



--	strictly monitor the preparation and submission of Daily Time Records of all officials and employees on a monthly basis as prescribed under Section 2, Rule XVII of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292 to avoid suspension or disallowance in audit; and



--	drop from the payroll the names of all officers and employees who will incur late/non-submission of their Daily Time Records for more than two months until these shall have been complied with.



3)	Advance payments for two projects attributed to Gender and Development (GAD) were paid without the requisite bank guarantee, or, surety bond, while progress payments were not subjected to retention money of ten percent totaling P1,669,585.13, contrary to the Annex E of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act (R.A.) 9184 on Contract Implementation Guidelines for the Procurement of Infrastructure Project; thus, the interest of the procuring entity was not protected.

 

We recommended that Management deduct ten percent of the total contract prices from the final payment as retention money and which shall be released to contractors only upon final acceptance of the work as prescribed under Section 6 of Annex E of the Revised IRR of RA 9184.



We further recommended that Management adhere with the laws, rules and regulations as provided under the Revised IRR of the R.A. 9184 for future infrastructure projects; among others, to require contractors to provide bank guarantee or surety bonds for any advance payments claimed and to deduct retention money from progress payments or to require bank guarantee as substitute thereof.



Management was amenable and agreed to adhere with the recommendations.



4)	The benefits of the Student Assistance Fund for Education (SAFE) for Loan program were not maximized due to the following practices of the agency: a) loans amounting to P443,670.00 were granted to non-qualified students who are in their first year of study, contrary to CHED Memorandum Order No. 25, series of 2008 prescribing the guidelines for the implementation of the program; and b) loans granted aging five to 13 years totaling P679,382.00 remained uncollected as of year-end.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



--	require the SAFE Loan Committee in-charge to screen and accept applicants in accordance with set criteria as provided in CHED Memorandum Order No. 25, series 2008 which is to grant loans to students who are in their 3rd, 4th, 5th or graduating year of study;



--	require the SAFE Loan Committee to monitor the status of enrolment of each student-borrowers; and



--	require the Accountant to issue demand letters to the defaulting student-borrowers and their co-makers and maintain subsidiary ledger cards of student-borrowers to aid in monitoring outstanding balances.



5)	The Waste Materials Report (WMR) was not used to report damaged/destroyed materials that have been replaced; thus, there was no assurance that materials previously taken up in the books of accounts as assets have been properly disposed of and derecognized from the books.



We recommended that management require the preparation of Waste Materials Report (WMR) for every replacement of parts/accessories and require concerned personnel to turn over the replaced parts to the Supply Officer for safekeeping and proper disposal.  



We also recommended that Management require the Accounting Unit to derecognize from the books all waste materials previously taken up in the books of accounts as assets upon proper disposal thereof.



Management agreed and promised to adhere with the audit recommendations.



6)	The Supply Officer did not use Inventory Tag/Stickers on issued property to end users from 2018 to 2020 as an effective methodical system of inventory; thus, properties could not be readily identified and cross-referencing to the Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) and other records was not facilitated.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Supply Officer to use Inventory Tag/Sticker on all old and newly acquired property as an effective control on the proper use of government property and to facilitate the conduct of inventory.  



7)	The Report on Monthly Fuel Consumption of government vehicles was not prepared and submitted to COA as required under COA Circular No. 77-61 dated September 26, 1977 and the driver’s trip tickets were not properly filled up; thus, the reasonableness of gasoline expenses amounting to P339,116.03 could not be ascertained.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



--	assign an employee to prepare the Monthly Fuel Consumption Report of vehicles owned by the agency and submit the report to COA for verification; and



--	require drivers to fill up properly all trip tickets indicating therein the plate number of the vehicle, destination, purpose, passenger, quantity of fuel loaded to the vehicle, time of departure and arrival from the trip and to submit all copies of the trip tickets to the assigned employee for the preparation of the Monthly Fuel Consumption Report.



8)	The GAD Plan and Budget totaling P22,769,172.72 of the agency is compliant with the five percent of the total appropriations, minimum requirement.  However, only P14,382,005.51 or 63 percent of the total budget was utilized; hence, some identified GAD issues were not addressed.



We recommended that Management continue their compliance on allotting at least five percent of the total appropriations authorized in their annual GAA and implement all identified GAD projects and activities in the GPB.



We also recommended that Management include in their plan alternative methods of conducting GAD seminars and trainings for the students and employees during the pandemic such as webinars or other remote learning methods.  



Management agreed and promised to adhere with the audit recommendations.



9)	Seven production centers of the Income Generating Projects (IGPs) of the agency earned a total income of P662,046.00. However, two of the projects incurred a total loss of P426,095.34; thus, the objective of income generation was not fully attained. Also, validation of actual production, sales and inventory could not be undertaken due to absence of data such as quantity and unit price; hence, there was no proper monitoring of projects.



We recommended that Management immediately require all Project Managers to prepare periodic reports such as Production Report, Sales Report and Inventory Report, among others, complete with data as to quantity, unit price and other information that would facilitate monitoring of actual production, sales and inventory.



We also recommended that Management adopt policies on pricing, production and sales monitoring and other control measures which shall be incorporated in the IGP Manual to maximize the potential of an IGP to generate income for the agency.



Management agreed and promised to adhere with the audit recommendations.



	

10)		Summary of Total Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges



Unsettled audit disallowances of the ASIST as of December 31, 2020 amounted to P759,423.05.



11)	Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations



Of the 45 prior years’ audit recommendations, 7 were fully implemented, 22 were partially implemented and 16 were not implemented as of December 31, 2020.
