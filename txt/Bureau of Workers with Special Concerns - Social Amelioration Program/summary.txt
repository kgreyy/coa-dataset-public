EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

A. Introduction 
 

By virtue of Executive Order (EO) No. 366, the Bureau of Workers with Special 

Concerns (BWSC) was created under the approved Department of Labor and 

Employment (DOLE) Rationalization Plan to assume the merged functions, programs, 

projects and services of the former Bureau of Rural Workers (BRW) and Bureau of 

Women and Young Workers.  The BWSC will continue the mission and mandate 

entrusted to BRW towards rural workers’ welfare, protection and development under 

Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1365, implement and supervise the Social Amelioration 

Program (SAP) for workers in the sugar industry pursuant to PD No. 621 and Republic 

Act (RA) No. 6982, known as Sugar Amelioration Act of 1991. 
 

The SAP aims to augment the income of the sugar workers; finance socio-

economic programs/projects geared to provide additional livelihood and employment 

opportunities for the sugar workers and their families; promote sugar workers’ welfare 

and social protection; and increase stakeholders’ participation in decision-making, 

particularly on policies related to workers and development under the Act. 
 

 The SAP was strengthened by the passage of RA No. 6982, with the provision of 

additional monetary and welfare benefits for sugar workers and with the 

institutionalization of a tripartite approach in policy formulation and program 

development and implementation headed by the Secretary of the DOLE.  Section 7 of RA 

No. 6982 provides that effective sugar crop years 1991-1992, a lien of ₱5.00 per picul of 

sugar shall be imposed on the gross production of sugar, provided that there shall be an 

automatic additional lien of ₱1.00 for every two years for the succeeding ten years from 

the effectivity of the Act,  thus from crop years 2001-2002 to 2018-2019, the sugar lien 

under RA No. 6982 was increased to ₱10.00 per picul or an equivalent of ₱7.90513 per 

50-kilo bag (LKG) and was allocated as shown below:

The 20 percent SEPRF is taken up in the BWSC-SAP books of accounts. The three 

percent SWMBF, five percent SWDBF and nine percent SEPF are recorded as trust funds 

under the account “Trust Liabilities,” while the three percent AEF is recorded under 

account “Income from Grants and Donations.”  However, the 80 percent of the lien is 

held in trust by the mills for distribution to the sugar workers. 

 

The DOLE manages and supervises the Program through the BWSC with the 

assistance of the STC, which serves as an advisory body. The STC is composed of 10 

members; the Secretary of DOLE or his authorized representative as an ex-officio 

Chairman, one representative from the Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) who 

likewise sits in an ex-officio capacity, two representatives from the Millers’ Sector, two 

representatives from the Mill Workers Sector, two representatives from the Field 

Workers Sector, and two representatives from the Planters Sector.  Representatives from 

the Planters, Millers and Workers Sectors shall serve a term of three years. The STC shall 

meet for its regular meeting once every three months.  
  
Further, under Section 6 of the same Act, a DTC was created in each milling 

district in the Philippines to ensure greater participation of planters, millers and workers 

in the social and economic programs and policy determination.  The DTC consists of 

seven members, the DOLE Regional Director (RD) as the ex-officio Chairman, two 

representatives each from the Planters and Field Workers’ Sectors, and one representative 

each from the Millers and Mill Workers Sectors, as members. 
   
 The SAP in the sugar industry has five components, namely; the Cash Bonus 

Distribution Program, MBP, DBP, Socio-Economic Projects and Tripartite Consultative 

Mechanisms.  

  

While, in Section 11(e) of RA No. 9367, “The Biofuels Act of 2006”, DOLE was 

given the authority to manage the Social Amelioration and Welfare Program (SAWP) 

with the following functions: 

 

a) Promote gainful livelihood opportunities and facilitate productive employment 
through effective employment services and regulation; 

b) Ensure the access of workers to productive resources and social protection 
coverage; and 

c) Recommend plans, policies and programs that will enhance the social impact of 
the National Biofuel Board (NBB). 

 

 The objectives of SAWP mainly focused on promotion of gainful livelihood 

opportunities, productive employment through effective employment services and 



 

 

 

iii 

 

regulations and ensuring access of workers to productive resources and social protection 

coverage specifically for biofuel workers. 

 

  The BWSC is headed by Atty. Ma. Karina Perida-Trayvilla, Director IV. The 

Workers Social Amelioration Development Division (WSADD) is for SAP Fund 

supervised by Ms. Carol Anne P. Resurreccion, Supervising Labor and Employment 

Officer/ Officer-in-Charge. As of December 31, 2020, the BWSC-SAP WSADD had a 

total personnel complement of nine regular employees and eight Job Order 

(JO)/outsourced workers, details as follows:

D. Scope of Audit 
 

 The audit covered the review of the accounts and operations of the BWSC-SAP for 

CY 2020.  The audit was conducted to: (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be 

place on Management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the 

propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules 

and regulations; and (c) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit 

recommendations. 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

 The Auditor rendered an unqualified opinion as there are no accounted 

misstatements and the accounting deficiencies as discussed in detail in Part II of this 

Report do not affect in material respects the fairness of the presentation of the FSs as of 

December 31, 2020.

F. Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

 Among the audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in 

Part II of this report, the significant observations are summarized as follows: 
 

1. The reliability, accuracy, and existence of the year end reported balances in the 
aggregate amount of ₱1,177,946,592.10 of the accounts Cash in Bank (CIB), Due 

from Regional Offices (ROs), Due from Non-Government Organizations/Civil 

Society Organizations (NGOs/CSOs), Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE), Trust 

Liabilities and Donations in Cash are doubtful  due to deficiencies amounting to 

₱481,340,786.13 resulting from non-maintenance of Subsidiary Ledger/SL or lack of 

supporting documents, unreconciled balances, erroneous disclosure in the Notes to 

Financial Statements  and misclassification of accounts. (Observation No. 1) 

 

Non-maintenance of Subsidiary Ledger (SL) for each bank account under the CIB-

LCCA and CIB-LCSA Accounts 

 

We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the Accountant to: 

  

a. maintain separate SL for each bank account and present the same to the 
Audit Team for validation; and 

 

b. furnish the BWSC-CO Audit Team copies of the BRSs submitted by the ROs 
III, VI and X. 

 

Lack of documents supporting the remittances, penalty on unremitted Lien Collection 

and forfeited unclaimed and undistributed cash bonus from ROs totaling 

₱94,420,342.83 

 

We recommended, and Management agreed, to:  

 

a. require the concerned ROs to submit documents supporting the remittances, 
penalty on unremitted lien collection and forfeited unclaimed and 

undistributed cash bonus, in compliance with the DO 114-11; and 

 

b. submit the analysis of monthly Report of Sugar Production, Withdrawal, 
Lien Collection and Remittance. 

 

Variance of ₱35,500.00 between Trust Liabilities and Donations in Cash and its 

corresponding Cash Accounts 

 

We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the Accountant to explain 

the discrepancy of ₱35,500.00 and effect the necessary adjusting entries. 

 

 

 



 

 

 

viii 

 

Unreconciled Due from ROs account balances between BWSC and ROs books - 

₱17,447,699.40 

 

We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the Accountant to 

conduct regular analysis of the account Due from ROs and coordinate with the 

DOLE ROs Accountants for the reconciliation of the records, effect all 

necessary adjustments, and establish balance per fund and RO. 

 

Erroneous presentation of aging of receivables in the Notes to FSs - ₱63,461,560.00 

  

We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the Accountant to 

submit the correct aging of receivables and revise the Notes to FSs. 

 

Unreconciled balance of Due from NGOs/CSOs - ₱1,255,349.10 

 

We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the Accountant to reconcile 

the BWSC’s records with the UNIFED’s book balance and effect the necessary 

adjusting entries. 

 

Misclassification of PPE Items within PPE accounts- ₱114,360.00 

 

We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the Accountant to 

prepare the necessary adjusting entry to properly classify PPE items in the 

books and the Property Officer to reclassify the same in the RPCPPE. 

 

2. The Due from RO account balance of ₱98,534,514.67 includes: a) ₱63,461,560.00 
unliquidated balance, the purpose of which has already been served and therefore is 

due  for liquidation based on  Tripartite Consultative Council (TCC) Resolution Nos. 

1 and 2, s. 2020 and Sugar Tripartite Council (STC) Resolution No. 4, s. 2020; b) 

₱1,303,846.44 outstanding fund transfers for eight to nine years without the 

status/monitoring report; and c) ₱11,140,429.41 dormant accounts for 10 years or 

more. (Observation No. 3) 

 

We recommended, and Management agreed, to require: 

 

a. the respective ROs to fast track the liquidation of the fund transfers 
totaling ₱63,461,560.00 and submit the required reports thereof in 

compliance with TCC Resolution Nos. 1 and 2, s. 2020 and STC Resolution 

No. 4, s. 2020, to the Audit Team for review and evaluation; 

 

b. ROs V, VI, and VII to submit the status report of the fund transfers 
totaling ₱1,303,846.44 and cause immediate refund if necessary, for the proper 

settlement of the account; and 

 

c. require the Chief Accountant to coordinate with the DOLE ROs Accountants for 
the reconciliation of the dormant accounts totaling ₱11,140,429.41 and proper 



 

 

 

ix 

 

documentation as basis in the filing of a request for authority to write-off the 

dormant accounts to the Audit Team Leader and/or Supervising Auditor, 

pursuant of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. 

 

3. The insufficient monitoring of the distribution of 80 percent CBF and coordination 
with the concerned stakeholders resulted in the accumulation of  undistributed 

amount due the workers totaling  ₱422,770,186.77 by the Mills, Planters 

Associations (PAs), and Planters Members (PMs) from Crop Years 1991-1992 to 

2019-2020 of which ₱161,331,914.80 is deemed forfeited in favor of the 

socioeconomic programs for sugar workers according to Section 9 of RA No. 6982 

dated May 1, 1991, thus, affecting the full attainment of the program’s objective of 

augmenting the sugar workers income to enjoy decent living for themselves and their 

families and the reliability of the status report of the  CBF as of December 31, 2020. 

(Observation No. 4) 
 

We reiterated our previous years’ audit recommendations that Management to: 

 

a. coordinate with the ROs on the monitoring of the compliance by the 
concerned Mills/PAs/Coops/PMs on the distribution of the CBF and 

remittance of the undistributed CBF and forfeited amount; otherwise, legal 

action may be taken into consideration to intensify the distribution and 

remittance thereof;  

 

b. require the establishment of complete database for sugar workers; 
 

c. require the Accounting Divisions of both the DOLE ROs and the BWSC-CO 
to maintain records of the total shares, distributions, balances and forfeited 

undistributed Cash Bonus per RO for control and monitoring purposes and 

submit the same to the Audit Team, for verification; and 

 

d. coordinate with the STC to include in their regular meetings the issues raised 
and to come up with a resolution that will monitor and prevent the 

accumulation of unreleased/undistributed CBF. 

 

4. The eligibility of the 153 beneficiaries of the SAWP-AMIN could not be ascertained due 
to lack of documentary requirements, hence casts doubt on the attainment of the purpose 

of the said program/project of  providing income augmentation to affected biofuel workers 

who were neither included nor covered by the DOLE COVID-19 Adjustment 

Measures Program (CAMP), DOLE Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa Ating 

Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers Program #Barangay Ko, Bahay Ko (TUPAD 

#BKBK) Disinfecting/ Sanitation Project, Department of Social Welfare 

Development (DSWD)-led SAP and other financial/cash assistance provided by the 

NGA or Local Government Units (LGUs). (Observation No. 5) 

 

 

 

 



 

 

 

x 

 

We recommended, and Management agreed, to: 

 

a. direct the Accountable Officer to submit to the Audit Team the lacking 
documents in accordance with the implementation of SAWP-AMIN and DOLE 

Advisory Nos. 12 and 12-A series of 2020; and 

 

b. submit certification that the beneficiaries were neither included nor covered by 
the DOLE CAMP, DOLE TUPAD #BKBK, DSWD-led SAP and other 

financial/cash assistance provided by the National or LGUs to demonstrate 

that certain requirement was met. 
 

5. The CY 2020 fund transfers to the NGOs/CSOs  of ₱21,815,000.00 and liquidations made 
of ₱1,676,174.26 were not supported with the necessary documents as required under 

COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, and DOLE DO No. 35-02, thus, the 

legality and propriety of the recorded transactions cannot be immediately established. 

Moreover, the balance of the account Due from NGOs/CSOs of ₱6,285,112.27 included 

dormant accounts of ₱258,750.00, which remained in the books for more than 10 years. 

(Observation No. 6) 

 

We recommended, and Management agreed, to:  

 

a. require the Accountant to coordinate with the concerned NGOs/CSOs for the 
submission of the lacking documents for the grants and liquidations of fund 

transfers as enumerated in Item No.  2.2 under COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated 

June 14, 2012 and Item No. 5.15 of DOLE DO No. 35-02 dated December 12, 

2002; 

 

b. submit  to the Audit Team for audit the status of the project/program for the 
unliquidated fund transfer of ₱258,750.00 covered by the Memorandum of 

Agreement (MOA) between the NOSWFI and the Bureau; and 

 

c. determine if legal action shall be instituted on any of the circumstances such as 
failure to complete the project and material violations of the MOA or COA 

Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007, in compliance with Item No. K 

under 4.5.3 of the said Circular. 
 

The foregoing audit observations and recommendations were earlier communicated 

through Audit Observation Memoranda (AOMs) and a Matrix of all issued AOMs was 

sent to Management for comment on April 12, 2021, in lieu of an exit conference due to 

the COVID-19 Pandemic. Their comments were incorporated in this Annual Audit 

Report (AAR), where appropriate. 

 

G. Status of Settlement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 
 

Audit Suspensions were all settled during CY 2019 and there was no issuance of 

Notices of Suspension, Disallowance and Charge during CY 2020. While audit 

disallowance of ₱271,934.86 issued prior to the effectivity of the 2009 Revised Rules and 



 

 

 

xi 

 

Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) dated September 15, 2009 remained 

unsettled as at yearend. 

 

H. Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations  
 

Of the 25 audit recommendations embodied in the prior year’s AAR, 14 were fully 

implemented and 11 were not implemented, as shown on the table below. The details of 

prior years’ recommendations are discussed in Part III of the Report.
