PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

1. The reliability, accuracy, and existence of the yearend reported balances in the 
aggregate amount of ₱1,177,946,592.10 of the accounts Cash in Bank (CIB), 

Due from Regional Offices (ROs), Due from Non-Government 

Organizations/Civil Society Organizations (NGOs/CSOs), Property, Plant and 

Equipment (PPE), Trust Liabilities and Donations in Cash are doubtful  due to 

deficiencies amounting to ₱481,340,786.13 resulting from non-maintenance of 

Subsidiary Ledger/SL or lack of supporting documents, unreconciled balances, 

erroneous disclosure in the Notes to Financial Statements  and misclassification 

of accounts.  
 

1.1 Section 6.e, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 
National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I on Qualitative 

Characteristics of Financial Reporting states that an entity shall present 

information including accounting policies in a manner that meets reliable 

information, which is free from material error and bias and can be depended 

upon by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to represent or 

could reasonably be expected to represent. 

 

1.2 Below are the details of the noted deficiencies:

a) Non-maintenance of SL for each bank account under the CIB-LCCA and 
CIB-LCSA Accounts 

 

1.3 The BWSC-CO maintained one current bank account and two local savings 
bank accounts, while the three ROs have their own separate current bank 

account, details are as shown below:

1.4 However, for these six bank accounts, the Accountant of the BWSC-CO 
maintained only two SLs for CIB accounts of the CO, one for LCCA and 

another for LCSA, thus indicating deficient monitoring of the bank accounts. 

 

1.5 As noted, the BWSC-CO had complied with the monthly preparation of the 
Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) for its bank accounts, which were 

submitted to the Audit Team. Also, inquiry thru email with the Regional 

Auditors of ROs III, VI, and X on the status of BRS submission on the bank 

accounts maintained by the Regions, with a total book balance of 

₱14,938,298.04 under the CIB-LCCA account, disclosed the following:

Monthly BRSs are regularly submitted and

1.6 However, the BWSC-CO Audit Team was not provided with copies of the 
ROs’ BRSs, thus the balances for each bank account maintained by the ROs 

as reflected in the FSs of the BWSC-CO could not be readily determined as to 

their accuracy, existence, and reliability. 

 

1.7 Had the Accountant of the BWSC-CO maintained separate SL for each bank 
account including those maintained by the ROs, validation of the correctness 

of each bank balance could have been facilitated and considering that the BRS 

for the regions were prepared by the Regional Accountants. 

 

1.8 We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the Accountant to: 
  

a. maintain separate SL for each bank account and present the same to 
the Audit Team for validation; and 

 

b. furnish the BWSC-CO Audit Team copies of the BRSs submitted by 
the ROs III, VI and X. 



31 
 

b) Lack of documents supporting the remittances, penalty on unremitted 
Lien Collection and forfeited unclaimed and undistributed cash bonus 

from ROs totaling ₱94,420,342.83 

 

1.9 Salient provisions of DO No. 114-11, amending the Implementing Rules and 
Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 6982, state the following: 

 

Section 2. Collection and Remittance of the Lien

b) 20% Lien or SEPRF 

 

Within one month from date of collection, the Mill shall directly remit and 

deposit online the 20 percent or SEPRF portion of the lien to the Department

specifically maintained for the purpose at LBP-Intramuros Branch. 

 

2.3 Penalty on Unremitted Lien Collection

bonus shall be deemed forfeited. The forfeited amount, including its 

interests, shall be utilized for socio-economic projects or programs in 

favor of the sugar workers as recommended by the Sugar Tripartite 

Council (STC). 

 

6.2 The socio-economic projects or programs funded from forfeited cash 
bonus maybe implemented in the milling district from where the 

same is collected. 

 

6.3 The RO shall remit to the Secretary thru the Bureau the forfeited 
amounts within one month from date of forfeiture. 

 

1.10 CIB-LCSA account comprises of two bank accounts which are the depository 
bank accounts of 20 percent SAP-SEPRF lien on the gross production of 

sugar remitted by sugar mills/planters associations and the SAWP lien from 

the biodiesel and bioethanol companies.  

 

1.11 Analysis of the CIB-LCSA with beginning balance of ₱304,003,572.05 
disclosed that for CY 2020, a total of ₱429,280,280.40 was debited to the said 

account while ₱145,726,292.20 was incurred for disbursements therefrom. 

Details as follows:

Ending Balance as at 12.31.2020 283,553,988.20 

 

1.12 For CY 2020, out of ₱125,276,708.35 debited to CIB-LCSA, 
₱88,422,651.64 pertains to remittances of 20 percent Lien or SEPRF thru 

online and check deposits to LBP with only Monitoring Reports covering 

from January to December 2020 were attached thereto as required under 

Section 2.7-Report of Sugar Production, Withdrawal, Lien Collection and 

Remittance of DO No. 114-11, thus rendered doubtful as to the completeness 

of the recorded remittances, hence affecting the fair presentation of the CIB-

LCSA, Trust Liabilities and Donations in Cash. 

 

1.13 Likewise, the penalty for late remittance amounting to ₱657,490.98 for 
August, September, November, and December 2020, all collected from 

Central Azucarera De Tarlac, were only supported by Check Deposit Slips, 

which were acknowledged by the Cash Collecting Officer of the Bureau thru 

the issuance of Official Receipts (ORs) with no data as to the correctness of 

the computation of 10 percent per month on the unremitted lien collection, 

consistent with Section 2.3- Penalty on Unremitted Lien Collection of DO No. 

114-11.  

 

1.14 Also, the following forfeited unclaimed and undistributed cash bonus from 
ROs totaling ₱5,340,200.21 collected from ROs II, VI, VIII, and XI were only 

supported with ORs acknowledging the collections and without documents 

showing how the amounts were computed nor data supporting the collection 

for forfeited unclaimed and undistributed cash bonus which rendered it 

difficult to monitor what amount should have been collected or accrued in 

favor of the sugar workers.

1.15 We recommended, and Management agreed, to:  
 

a. require the concerned ROs to submit documents supporting the 
remittances, penalty on unremitted lien collection and forfeited 

unclaimed and undistributed cash bonus, in compliance with the DO 

114-11; and 

 

b. submit the analysis of monthly Report of Sugar Production, 
Withdrawal, Lien Collection and Remittance. 

 

c) Variance of ₱35,500.00 between Trust Liabilities and Donations in Cash 
and its corresponding Cash Accounts 

 

1.16 The 20 percent SEPRF is taken up in the BWSC-SAP/SAWP books of 
accounts. The three percent Sugar Workers Maternity Benefit Fund 

(SWMBF), five percent Sugar Workers Death Benefit Fund (SWDBF) and 

nine percent Socio-Economic Project Fund (SEPF) are recorded as trust funds 

under the account “Trust Liabilities,” while the three percent Administrative 

Expense Fund (AEF) is recorded under account “Donations in Cash”.  While 

the 80 percent of the lien is held in trust by the mills for distribution to the 

sugar workers.  

 

The 20 percent SEPRF is being recorded by the Bureau in the books as 

illustrated below: 

 

Dr. CIB-LCSA (20% SEPRF)                    xxx 

 Cr. Trust Liabilities (17%)          xxx 

  Cr. Donations in Cash (3%)          xxx 

  

1.17 However, our analysis of remittances/collections for CY 2020 recorded under 
CIB-LCSA totaling ₱88,422,651.64 and its corresponding Trust Liabilities 

and Donations in Cash accounts of ₱77,571,447.37 and ₱10,886,704.27, 

respectively, revealed a variance totaling ₱35,500.00. Details are shown as

1.18 We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the Accountant to 
explain the discrepancy of ₱35,500.00 and effect the necessary adjusting 

entries. 
 

1.19 Management commented that the variance of ₱35,500.00 was due to the 
following: 

 

 The ₱4,500.00 noted on 20 percent SEPRF collection represents refunds 
from DOLE RO X as discussed in the adjusting or correcting entry per 

Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) No. 2020-12-145. The said adjustment is 

also noted on the Schedule of Remittances submitted by the Bureau as 

attachment to the CY 2020 FSs. However, the said amount was still 

inadvertently recorded as part of 20 percent SEPRF Remittance, instead of 

Refunds, in the submitted Statement of Cash Flows. 

 

 The ₱40,000.00 noted on Collection from CME plants represents the 
SAWP lien remittance of Chemrez Technologies Inc. As discussed on the 

first paragraph of Item 4 of the Notes to FSs, the said amount was 

delivered to the BWSC on December 23, 2020 and remained under the 

Cash-Collecting Officer account until the amount was deposited to the 

CIB-LCSA on January 4, 2021. 

 

d) Unreconciled Due from ROs account balances between BWSC and ROs 
books - ₱17,447,699.40 

 

1.20 Results of confirmation letters from the DOLE-ROs Audit Teams disclosed a 
disparity of ₱17,447,699.40 due to the failure of Management to conduct 

regular and periodic verification, analysis, and validation of the existence of 

the fund transfers with the ROs. For DOLE-ROs III, VI, VII, and VIII, no 

confirmations yet were received to date. Details are shown as follows:

1.21 We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the Accountant to 
conduct regular analysis of the account Due from ROs and coordinate 

with the DOLE ROs Accountants for the reconciliation of the records, 

effect all necessary adjustments, and establish balance per fund and RO. 

 

e) Erroneous presentation of aging of receivables in the Notes to FSs - 
₱63,461,560.00 

 

1.22 Aging of receivable account Due from ROs as presented in the Notes to FSs 
as of December 31, 2020 showed the following:

1.23 However, our further analysis of SL balances of the account disclosed that the 
funds transferred to ROs from April to June 2020 totaling ₱63,461,560.00 

were outstanding for more than six to eight months, which is not consistent 

with the reported aging of Due from ROs as presented in the Notes to FSs.

Total    63,461,560.00  

 

1.24 It was also noted that the aging of receivables does not conform to the forms 
being required in the GAM for NGAS, Volume II, which resulted in erroneous 

aging of fund transfer and proper analysis thereof could not be conducted.  

 

1.25 We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the Accountant to 
submit the correct aging of receivables and revise the Notes to FSs. 

  

f) Unreconciled balance of Due from NGOs/CSOs - ₱1,255,349.10 
 

1.26 Results of the confirmation letters sent to the United Sugar Producers’ Federation 
of the Philippines, Inc. (UNIFED), National Federation of Sugarcane Planters, Inc. 

(NFSP) and Negros Occidental Sugar Workers Foundation, Inc. (NOSWFI)  

NGOs/CSOs disclosed that only UNIFED and NFSP sent their replies as presented 

in the table below. For UNIFED, they have noted that the balance of ₱1,766,250.00 

shown in their books was supported with liquidations and the same was the fund 

balance as of July 2020, thus resulting in a disparity of ₱1,255,349.10.

necessary adjusting entries.

reconciliation of accounting and property records, conduct of physical count, 

and disposal of unserviceable properties are governed by the following 

provisions of the GAM for NGAs: 

 

 Chapter 10, Volume I: 
 

a) Section 5(b), any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the 
location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 

manner intended by management shall be considered in the measurement 

of PPE at initial recognition. Among the examples of directly attributable 

costs are installation and assembly costs. 

 

b) Section 12, Cost of PPE acquired through donation without condition 
shall be taken up at its fair value at the date it is acquired. All expenses 

incurred in connection with the donated asset, such as delivery and 

installation costs, shall be included in the amount recognized as asset. 

The fair value of the PPE shall be recognized as “Income from Grants 

and Donations in Kind.” 

 

c) Section 38, the entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which 
shall be done annually and presented on the RPCPPE as at December 31 

of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later 

than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at the station 

and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the 

Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording. 

 

 Section 6, Item No. 5, Chapter 3, Volume III, defines the following: 
 

a) Office Equipment - This account is used to recognize the cost incurred 
in the purchase or assembly or fair value, if acquired through donation 

or transfers without cost, of office equipment for use in government 

operations. It includes duplicating/photocopying machines, air 

conditioning units and the like. Credit this account for disposal or 

derecognition of the carrying amount of the replaced parts in major 

repairs. 

 

b) Communication Equipment - This account is used to recognize the 

cost incurred in the purchase or assembly or fair value, if acquired 

through donation or transfers without cost, of communications 

equipment for use in government operations. Credit this account for 

derecognition of the carrying amount of the replaced parts in major 

repairs, or disposal. 

 



39 
 

1.29 Reconciliation is the process that ensures that two sets of records of a 
particular account are in agreement. As part of accounting controls, it 

facilitates a countercheck on the accuracy of accounting records and/or 

integrity of property custodianship. 

 

1.30 As of December 31, 2020, the PPE accounts of ₱37,186,210.00 with 
accumulated depreciation of ₱16,116,010.49 had a carrying amount/ ending 

balance of ₱21,070,199.51, summarized as follows:

1.31 For CY 2020, neither additions nor deductions were made to the accounts. As 
noted, the books of accounts and the Report on the Physical Count of 

Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as of December 31, 2020 reflect the 

same total amount.  

 

1.32 However, audit of the PPE accounts revealed that ₱114,360.00 of PPE items 
were erroneously recorded in the books and RPCPPE as Communication 

Equipment, instead of Other PPE accounts, thus resulted in overstatement and 

understatement of the accounts, respectively, by the same amount of 

₱114,360.00. Details are as follows:

1.33 The above misclassification also affects the corresponding accumulated 
depreciations of both accounts. 

 

1.34 We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the Accountant to 
prepare the necessary adjusting entry to properly classify PPE items in 

the books and the Property Officer to reclassify the same in the RPCPPE. 

 

 

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 

Improperly accomplished RPCPPE 

 

2. The RPCPPE was not accomplished based on Appendix 73 of GAM for NGAs, 
Volume II because it has no data on the quantity of items or articles per 

physical count as well as on their whereabouts and conditions, thus defeating 

the purpose of the inventory-taking of ascertaining the accuracy and existence 

of the PPE items as reported in the books of account and the integrity of 

property custodianship. 

 

2.1 Pertinent provisions of Appendix 73 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II are as 
follows: 

 

A. The RPCPPE is the form used to report on the physical count of PPE by 

type such as land, land improvements, infrastructure, building and other 

structures, machinery and equipment, transportation equipment, furniture, 

fixtures and books, etc. which are owned by the agency. It shall be 

prepared yearly by fund cluster.  

 

B. This form shall be accomplished as follows: 

 

1. Type of Property, Plant and Equipment - PPE account name such 
as Heavy Equipment, Technical and Scientific Equipment, Motor 

Vehicle, Office Equipment, Furniture and Fixtures, etc. 

2. As at__________ - date of the report 
3. Fund Cluster - fund cluster name/code in accordance with UACS 
4. Name of Accountable Officer - name of the accountable officer 
5. Official Designation - official designation of the accountable officer 
6. Entity Name - agency or office where the accountable officer is 

assigned 



41 
 

7. Date of Assumption - first day of assumption of the duties and 
responsibilities as accountable officer 

8. Article - type of item or article (e.g., personal computer, printer, filing 
cabinet, etc.) 

9. Description - brief description of the article/item (e.g., Acer monitor 
for personal computer, Epson for printer, etc.) 

10. Property Number - assigned property number by the Supply and/or 
Property Division/Unit 

11. Unit of Measure - unit of measurement of the property, plant and 
equipment (e.g., piece, set, etc.) 

12. Unit Value - cost per quantity unit 
13. Quantity-Per Property Card - quantity of items or articles appearing 

in the PC 

14. Quantity-Per Physical Count - quantity of items or articles per 
physical count 

15. Shortage/Overage - excess of the quantity and total value of items or 
articles per PPELC over that of the physical count or vice versa 

16. Remarks - whereabouts, conditions and other relevant information 
relative to PPE 

 

2.2 The RPCPPE as of December 31, 2020  of the Bureau was found  unreliable 
due to the absence of data on the quantity of items or articles per physical 

count and the  assigned property number by the Supply and/or Property 

Division/Unit,  details are shown below:

2.3 Due to lack of data on the number of items or articles per physical count, any 
shortage or overage in comparison with the data in the Property Cards (PCs) 

and Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) was not established. 

It was also noted that other relevant information for monitoring purposes such 

as the whereabouts and conditions of the PPE items were not indicated in the 

RPCPPE.  

 

2.4 To validate the existence of the said PPEs, confirmation letters were sent 
through email to DOLE ROs Audit Team. The Audit Teams of DOLE ROs III 

and VI acknowledged and confirmed the physical existence of the PPE items 

located in their respective regions, while no confirmations yet were received 

from ROs II, IV-A, V, VII, and X, to date. 

 

2.5 In the absence of confirmation from the other ROs, the actual physical 
existence of the PPE items are not assured, thereby casting doubt on the 

correctness of the reported balances in the FSs, more so that the RPCPPE could 

not be made as basis for checking the accuracy of the PPE balances. 

 

2.6 We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the Property 
Officer to coordinate closely with the DOLE ROs to properly accomplish 

the RPCPPE pursuant to the instructions in Appendix 73, by completing 

the data on property number assigned by the Supply and/or Property 

Division/Unit, the quantity of items or articles per physical count as well 

as the whereabouts, conditions and other relevant information.

3.8 The balance of ₱63,461,560.00 remained outstanding and due for liquidation 
within 15 working days after complete submission of proof of distribution by 

the Planters’ associations, Mills, and Workers’ unions/associations and after 

the issuance of the Notice of Completion under the approved TCC Resolution 

Nos. 1 and 2, s. 2020 and STC Resolution No. 4, s. 2020, respectively.  

 

3.9 Considering that the implementation of the projects is provided with timelines 
and the purpose for which the outstanding balance of ₱63,461,560.00 has 

already been served, such balance, therefore, is already due for liquidation. 

Further, in accordance with the TCC and STC Resolutions, the liquidations and 

corresponding reports thereof should have been submitted to the Bureau.

3.11 Aging of Due from ROs as presented in the Notes to FSs as of December 31, 
2020 reported dormant accounts of ₱11,140,429.41 aged from 10 to more than 

30 years due to insufficient monitoring of the Management not in accordance 

with COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2005. 

 

3.12 The Management should conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis 
and validation of the existence of the receivables, in consistent with COA 

Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2005.  

 

3.13 The dormant receivables where settlement or collectability could no longer be 
ascertained, the Management should consider to file a request for authority to 

write-off following the step-by-step procedures enumerated in COA Circular 

No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016in order to come up with a more reliable 

balance of receivables. 

 

3.14 We recommended, and Management agreed, to require: 
 

a. the respective ROs to fast track the liquidation of the fund transfers 
totaling ₱63,461,560.00 and submit the required reports thereof in 

compliance with TCC Resolution Nos. 1 and 2, s. 2020 and STC 

Resolution No. 4, s. 2020, to the Audit Team for review and 

evaluation;  

 

b. ROs V, VI, and VII to submit the status report of the fund transfers 
totaling ₱1,303,846.44 and cause immediate refund if necessary, for 

the proper settlement of the account; and  



49 
 

c. require the Chief Accountant to coordinate with the DOLE ROs 
Accountants for the reconciliation of the dormant accounts totaling 

₱11,140,429.41and proper documentation as basis in the filing of a 

request for authority to write-off the dormant accounts to the Audit 

Team Leader and/or Supervising Auditor, pursuant of COA Circular 

No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. 

 

Insufficient monitoring of the distribution of 80 percent Cash Bonus Fund (CBF) 

 

4. The insufficient monitoring of the distribution of 80 percent CBF and 
coordination with the concerned stakeholders resulted in the accumulation of  

undistributed amount due the workers totaling  ₱422,770,186.77 by the Mills, 

Planters Associations (PAs), and Planters Members (PMs) from Crop Years 

1991-1992 to 2019-2020 of which ₱161,331,914.80 is deemed forfeited in favor of 

the socioeconomic programs for sugar workers according to Section 9 of RA No. 

6982 dated May 1, 1991, thus, affecting the full attainment of the program’s 

objective of augmenting the sugar workers income to enjoy decent living for 

themselves and their families and the reliability of the status report of the  CBF 

as of December 31, 2020. 

 

4.1 To strengthen the rights of the workers in the sugar industry and for them to 
augment their income to enjoy decent living for themselves and their families, 

a ₱5.00 lien per picul shall be imposed on the gross production of sugar and 

shall have an automatic additional of one peso (₱1.00) for every two years for 

the succeeding ten years from effectivity pursuant to Section 7 of RA No. 

6982 dated May 1, 1991. Further, 80 percent of the lien shall be distributed as 

cash bonus in proportion to the service rendered by the workers which were 

collected by the sugar millers and released to the planters’ associations for 

distribution to the workers. 

 

4.2 Salient provisions of RA No. 6982 state the following: 
 

Section 7. Lien; Distribution; Collection and Remittance. – 

 

a) Effective crop year 1991-1992 a lien of Five pesos (₱5.00) per picul of sugar 

shall be imposed on the gross production of sugar to primarily augment the 

income of sugar workers, and to finance social and economic programs to 

improve their livelihood and well-being: provided, that there shall be an 

automatic additional lien of One peso (₱1.00) for every two years for the 

succeeding 10years from the effectivity of this Act: provided, further, that the 

Secretary of Labor and Employment may, upon the recommendation of the 

STC, suspend or reduce the amount of the automatic additional lien herein 

authorized whenever circumstances occur adversely affecting or causing undue 

increases in the cost of producing sugar, taking into consideration the declared 

policy of this Act. 

 



50 
 

The amounts herein imposed shall be borne by the sugar planters and millers in 

proportion to their corresponding milling share and said amounts shall 

constitute a lien on their sugar quedans and/or warehouse receipts. 

 

b) Eighty percent of the lien, including any and all incomes or interests derived 

therefrom, shall be distributed as cash bonus to each worker in the sugar farm 

or mill based on the proportion of work rendered by him. The cash bonus share 

of the worker shall be collected by the sugar mills and released to planters’ 

associations in the case of affiliated planters, or directly to unaffiliated planters, 

for distribution to their respective workers. The cash bonus share of the mill 

workers shall be held in trust by the mills for distribution to the workers. 

 

The remaining 20percent of the lien shall be collected by the sugar mills and to 

be remitted to the DOLE and utilized pursuant to Section 10 hereof. 

 

c) The collection of the lien shall be made upon the withdrawal or release of the 

sugar from the mill warehouse but in no case beyond 180 days from the date of 

the issuance of the corresponding sugar quedans or warehouse receipts: 

provided, that, after said 180 days, the miller shall advance whatever amount is 

necessary to pay such lien and charge the holder of said sugar quedans or 

warehouse receipts the amount so paid and such reasonable rate of interest as 

may be prevailing in the banking community. 

 

a) It shall be the duty of every sugar mill to remit the lien collected within one 
month from the date of collection thereof; otherwise, a penalty of ten percent 

per month on the unremitted collection shall be imposed upon the violator. 

 

The cash bonus portion of the lien shall, in turn, be distributed to sugar workers 

concerned within one month from the date of remittance; otherwise, a penalty 

of ten percent per month on the undistributed cash bonus shall be imposed 

upon the violator. 

 

All penalties for non-remittance of lien collected shall accrue to the social and 

economic programs for the sugar workers. Such penalties for non-distribution 

of the cash bonus shall accrue to the sugar workers concerned. 

 

Section 9. Undistributed Cash Bonus-Any undistributed amount due the 

workers shall, within three months, be remitted to and held in trust by the 

DOLE for a period of three years from the date of remittance, after which it 

shall be deemed forfeited in favor of the socioeconomic programs for sugar 

workers. 

 

It shall be the duty of the Secretary of Labor and Employment to make at least 

three publications before the end of said three-year period and to make the 

corresponding radio announcements in radio stations operating in the area to 

inform the beneficiaries concerned regarding their unclaimed cash bonus. The 



51 
 

said publications shall be made through local newspapers and by posting in 

conspicuous public places in the area where the concerned beneficiaries reside. 

 

The forfeited amount, including its interests, shall be utilized for projects or 

programs in favor of the sugar workers as recommended by the STC. 

 

Section 13. Penal Sanctions. - Any person who intentionally violates Sections 

7, 8, 9, 10, and 14 of this Act, and any of the rules promulgated under Section 

11 hereof, shall be penalized with imprisonment of not less than six months but 

not more than one year or a fine of not less than Five thousand pesos 

(₱5,000.00) but not more than Twenty thousand pesos (₱20,000.00) or both. 

 

If the violation is committed by a corporation, trust or firm, partnership, 

association or any other entity, the penalty shall be imposed upon the entity's 

responsible officers, including, but not limited to, the president, vice-president, 

chief executive officer, general manager, managing director or partner. 

 

4.3 Audit of the CBF showed the following deficiencies: 
 

a) Undistributed amount due the workers totaling ₱422,770,186.77, inclusive 
of forfeited amount of ₱161,331,914.80; and 

 

4.4 The BWSC- CO consolidated and submitted to the Audit Team the Summary 
Report of CBF Collection, Remittances, Releases and Distribution under RA 

No. 6982 from the BWSC ROs as of 3rd quarter of CY 2020, which shows 

that   the total amount of ₱422,770,186.77 of CBFs for Crop Years 1991-

2020 were undistributed to the sugar workers and still with the 

Mill/Pas/Coops/PMs.  Details are as follows:

No. 6982 on the forfeiture clause is applicable, wherein the amount of 

₱161,331,914.80should have been remitted and held in trust by the DOLE 

was not observed, considering that the said amount remained undistributed to 

the sugar workers and remained at the possession of the 

Mills/PAs/Coops/PMs. Details of the supposed forfeited amount are as 

follows:

Total 161,331,914.80  

 

b) Non-maintenance/non-submission of supporting documents and database 
to properly monitor the distribution of 80% CBF. 

 

4.6 Our audit revealed that the Management failed to maintain accounting 
records to properly monitor the distribution of 80 percent CBF that resulted in 

the accumulated undistributed amount of ₱422,770,186.77. No other 



53 
 

accounting reports were maintained by the Bureau except for the consolidated 

summary report of CBF submitted by the ROs. 

 

4.7 Further, based on the previous year’s audit observation, the Management still 
failed to establish an updated and completed database for all sugar workers 

thru their millers/planters as the basis in the preparation of payrolls during 

crop schedules for the immediate release of the CBF. 

 

4.8 We reiterated our previous years’ audit recommendations that 
Management to: 

 

a. coordinate with the ROs on the monitoring of the compliance by the 
concerned Mills/PAs/Coops/PMs on the distribution of the CBF and 

remittance of the undistributed CBF and forfeited amount; otherwise, 

legal action may be taken into consideration to intensify the 

distribution and remittance thereof;  

 

b. require the establishment of complete database for sugar workers; 
 

c. require the Accounting Divisions of both the DOLE ROs and the 
BWSC-CO to maintain records of the total shares, distributions, 

balances and forfeited undistributed Cash Bonus per RO for control 

and monitoring purposes and submit the same to the Audit Team, for 

verification; and 

 

d. coordinate with the STC to include in their regular meetings the 
issues raised and to come up with a resolution that will monitor and 

prevent the accumulation of unreleased/undistributed CBF. 

 

4.9 Management commented that the Bureau will request the concerned DOLE 
ROs to review their reports and coordinate with the concerned industry 

stakeholders relative to the status of implementation of the SAP-CBP. 

 

Further, the plan to establish a complete database of sugar workers was put 

on-hold considering the anticipated budgetary requirement for the said 

project.   

 

The concerned DOLE ROs submit to the Bureau a quarterly report on the 

Status of CBP Implementation under R.A. 6982. The Bureau reviews and 

consolidates the submitted reports and will submit to the COA a copy of the 

consolidated report on a quarterly basis. 

 

The Bureau will include discussion on the UCBF on the succeeding meetings 

of STC. Concerns on the implementation of the SAP CBP and UCBF 

balances are also discussed during meetings of the DTCs, headed by the 

concerned DOLE ROs. 



54 
 

Financial Assistance to Biofuel Workers affected by COVID-19 pandemic 

 

5. The eligibility of the 153 beneficiaries of the SAWP-AMIN could not be ascertained 
due to lack of documentary requirements, hence casts doubt on the attainment of the 

purpose of the said program/project of providing income augmentation to affected 

biofuel workers who were neither included nor covered by the DOLE COVID-19 

Adjustment Measures Program (CAMP), DOLE Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa 

Ating Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers Program #Barangay Ko, Bahay Ko 

(TUPAD #BKBK) Disinfecting/ Sanitation Project, Department of Social 

Welfare Development (DSWD)-led SAP and other financial/cash assistance 

provided by the NGA or Local Government Units (LGUs). 
 

5.1 The SAWP which was established under RA No. 9367 or the Biofuels Act of 
2006 targets to improve the socio-economic well-being of workers engaged 

in the production of CME by providing livelihood assistance, training and 

educational assistance, social protection and welfare benefits, and emergency 

assistance through the lien collected from CME producers that are accredited 

by the Department of Energy (DOE). 

 

5.2 Aimed at providing income augmentation thru cash assistance to affected 
biofuel workers working at the time the community quarantine had been 

declared in the country, the TCC spearheaded by the TCC Chairperson and 

DOLE Secretary Silvestre H. Bello III approved the project proposal named 

as SAWP-AMIN in the amount of ₱5,461,000.00 which shall be sourced from 

the available SAWP Emergency Assistance Fund and Social Protection and 

Welfare Benefit Fund - Biodiesel Industry. 

 

5.3 SAWP-AMIN intends to provide: a) a one-time grant of ₱7,000.00 to affected 
biofuel workers who were neither included nor covered by the DOLE CAMP, 

DOLE TUPAD #BKBK, DSWD-led SAP and other financial/cash assistance 

provided by the national government agencies or LGUs; and b) an additional 

financial/cash assistance of ₱2,000.00 to affected biofuel workers who have 

earlier availed any of the above income augmentation measures or wage 

subsidy provided from the government, as a result of the enhance community 

quarantine (ECQ) and/or declaration of the State of Public Health Emergency 

due to COVID-19. 

 

5.4 It shall cover all biodiesel workers who are employed in any manner by the 
plant/mill. Only those biofuel workers working in-site, and at the time the 

ECQ/community quarantine had been declared, are eligible to access the one-

time financial assistance. 

 

5.5 As stated in the TCC Resolution, the implementation of SAWP-AMIN will 
be similar to DOLE CAMP. The DOLE CAMP under the Bayanihan to Heal 

as One Act (Bayanihan 1) is a safety net program that offers a one-time 

financial support to affected workers in the formal sector due to the COVID-



55 
 

19 pandemic. Some of the salient provisions of the DO No. 218 series of 

2020 or the guidelines on the implementation of CAMP are as follows: 

 

a) Excluded from the coverage of CAMP are: 1) government employees 
except public education institution personnel; 2) beneficiaries of 

Department of Finance’s (DOF) Small Business Wage Subsidy (SBWS) 

program, Social Security System’s (SSS) Unemployment Benefit, 

DSWD’s Expanded and Enhanced Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program, 

DSWD’s Assistance to Individuals and Crisis Situation and Department of 

Agriculture (DA) Cash Assistance for Rice Farmers; 3) owners, top 

management, or workers with monthly gross salary of ₱40,000.00 and 

above; and 4) foreign nationals except Persons of Concerns (POCs); 

 

b) To be eligible for the program, an applicant must be a: a) private 
establishment that has retrenched workforce or has implemented 

temporary or permanent closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 

including those who are in a contracting/subcontracting agreement and 

centralized human resource/payroll system; or b) worker who was 

retrenched and temporarily laid-off due to authorized causes; and 

 

c) The documentary requirements vary if the applicant is a private 
establishment or a displaced and temporary laid-off worker.  

 

i. Private establishments that have temporarily closed or temporarily 
laid-off workers shall submit payroll or any of the alternative 

documents stated in DOLE Labor Advisory No. 12-A series of 2020. 

For establishments that had permanently closed, an additional 

document which is the Notice of Closure stamped received by the 

LGUs shall be submitted. 

 

ii. Displaced and temporarily laid-off workers shall submit: 1) clear 
photo of himself/herself holding a valid government-issued ID;          

2) certificate issued by SSS that the applicant is not a recipient of any 

financial assistance from said agency or proof of SSS Notice of Denial 

such as screenshot of email; and 3) proof of unemployment. 

 

5.6 Among the provisions in the approved proposed project named as SAWP-
AMIn are the following:

Affected Workers due to COVID-19) and copy of latest company 

payroll for the month prior to the implementation of flexible work 

arrangement or temporary closure due to ECQ or localized 

community quarantine. 

 

In the absence of said required payroll, the establishment shall refer to 

the documentary requirements indicated in DOLE Labor Advisory No. 

12-A, s. 2020, to wit: 

 

1. Worker’s pay slip/verifiable handwritten pay slip; 
2. Proof of payment of wages via logbook or ledger; 
3. Employment contract; 
4. Cash voucher or petty cash voucher; 
5. Authority to debit account sent by employer to bank for the wage

8. List of employees with 13

th
 month pay 

 

Establishments that have initially submitted above documents for 

DOLE CAMP, but had been denied due to budgetary limitations, shall 

be automatically considered for the DOLE SAWP-AMIN, after the re-

validation by concerned DOLE RO/FO/PO. 

 

3. Depending on the status of evaluation, the following shall be 
issued to the applicant by the concerned DOLE RO within five 

working days through e-mail:

5.9 Our audit revealed that the LRs were only supported with: a) authority to hold 
cash advance; b) a master list with the names, amount received, date and 

signature of beneficiaries as proof of receipt of financial assistance; and c) 

photocopy of valid ID of beneficiaries with three specimens of signatures. 

 

5.10 However, the following documents, were not submitted, thus deemed 
insufficient to prove the eligibility of the beneficiaries: 

 

a) ERF  
b) List of Affected Workers due to COVID-19 and  



58 
 

c) Copy of latest company payroll for the month prior to the implementation 
of flexible work arrangement or temporary closure due to ECQ or 

localized community quarantine or in the absence of the said required 

payroll, the establishment may submit any of the following documents: 

i. Worker’s pay slip/verifiable handwritten pay slip; 
ii. Proof of payment of wages via logbook or ledger; 

iii. Employment contract; 
iv. Cash voucher or petty cash voucher; 
v. Authority to debit account sent by employer to bank for the wage of 

employees; 

vi. SSS, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG Alphalist or list of remittances; 
vii. BIR Form 2316; or 

viii. List of employees with 13

 month pay 

d) Proof that affected biofuel workers were neither included nor covered by 
the DOLE CAMP, DOLE TUPAD #BKBK, DSWD-led SAP and other 

financial/cash assistance provided by the NGA or LGUs as required by the 

SAWP-AMIN was not established, thereby casts doubt as to the eligibility 

of beneficiaries, hence, defeated the purpose of the said project. 

 

5.11 We recommended, and Management agreed, to: 
 

a. direct the Accountable Officer to submit to the Audit Team the lacking 
documents in accordance with the implementation of SAWP-AMIN and 

DOLE Advisory Nos. 12 and 12-A series of 2020; and 

 

b. submit certification that the beneficiaries were neither included nor 
covered by the DOLE CAMP, DOLE TUPAD #BKBK, DSWD-led 

SAP and other financial/cash assistance provided by the National or 

LGUs to demonstrate that certain requirement was met.

6.9 Moreover, the balance of the account Due from NGOs/CSOs of 
₱6,285,112.27 included dormant accounts of ₱258,750.00, which remained in 

the books for more than 10 years. 

  
6.10 Item No. K under 4.5.3 COA Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007 states 

that:  

 

Institution of legal action by the GO against the defaulting 

NGO/PO which fails to complete a project covered by the MOA, 

or for a material violation of the provisions of the MOA or of 

COA Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007, and in any 

of these cases, its subsequent disqualification from applying for 

another project in any other GO.  

 

6.11 As discussed in the previous year’s audit observation, the fund transfer to NOSWFI 
amounting to ₱258,750.00 which was granted on May 25, 2007, remained in the 

Due from NGOs/CSOs account for more than 13 years. Notwithstanding the 

continuous effort of the Management thru sending the final demand letter and 

follow-up letter dated Nov. 20, 2020, which was sent by the Legal Service, still, the 

NOSWFI failed to submit the necessary liquidation. 

 

6.12 We recommended, and Management agreed, to: 
 

a. require the Accountant to coordinate with the concerned NGOs/CSOs for 
the submission of the lacking documents for the grants and liquidations of 

fund transfers as enumerated in Item No.  2.2 under COA Circular No. 

2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and Item No. 5.15 of DOLE DO No. 35-02 

dated December 12, 2002; 

 

b. submit  to the Audit Team for audit the status of the project/program for 
the unliquidated fund transfer of ₱258,750.00 covered by the 

Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the NOSWFI and the 

Bureau; and 

 

c. determine if legal action shall be instituted on any of the circumstances 
such as failure to complete the project and material violations of the MOA 

or COA Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007, in compliance 

with Item No. K under 4.5.3 of the said Circular.

OTHER COMPLIANCE AUDIT  

 

Gender and Development (GAD) and Senior Citizens/Differently Abled Persons 

 

7. The reports for programs/projects and activities under the GAD and Senior 
Citizens/Persons with Disability (PWD) of the SAP/SAWP Fund were incorporated 

in the report of the DOLE. 

 

Compliance with Tax Laws 

 

8. Taxes withheld in CY 2020 amounting to ₱164,794.84 from the payments of 
purchases of supplies/materials and services were remitted to the Bureau of 

Internal Revenue (BIR) within the prescribed period provided under BIR 

Regulation No. 1-2013 dated January 23, 2013.  

 

8.1 Section 7 of the BIR-Revenue Regulations No. 11-2018 dated January 31, 
2018 states that “Every employer must withhold from compensation paid an 

amount computed in accordance with these Regulations, whether the 

employee is citizen or an alien, except non-resident alien not engaged in trade 

or business. Provided that no withholding tax be required on the Statutory 

Minimum Wage, including holiday pay, overtime pay, night shift differential 

and hazard pay of Minimum Wage Earners in the private/public sectors as 

defined in these Regulations.” 

 

8.2 Moreover, Section 7 of BIR Regulation No. 1-2013 dated January 23, 2013 
states that the due date for filing of tax returns withheld from suppliers should 

be on or before the 10
th

 day following the month in which withholding was 

made, except for taxes withheld for the month of December of each year, 

which shall be filed on or before January 15 of the succeeding year. 

 

8.3 Records showed that BWSC remitted to BIR the amount of ₱164,794.84 
representing the tax withheld for the months of January to November 2020. 

The taxes withheld for the month of December amounting to ₱234.37 was 

remitted to BIR on January 11, 2021. 

 

Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges 

 

9. Audit Suspensions were all settled in CY 2019 and there was no issuance of Notices 
of Suspension, Disallowance, and Charge during CY 2020. While audit disallowance 

of ₱271,934.86 issued before the effectivity of the 2009 Revised Rules and 

Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) dated September 15, 2009 remained 

unsettled as of yearend.  

 

9.1 We recommended that Management enforce the settlement of the 
disallowances of ₱271,934.86 pursuant to Section 28 of the 2009 RRSA.
