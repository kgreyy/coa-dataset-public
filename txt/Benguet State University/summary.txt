Executive Summary

	

A)	Introduction



Benguet State University (BSU) started as a Farm School in 1916. BSU pioneered in establishing Secondary and Agricultural Education among the Indigenous Peoples in the Provinces under the former Mountain Province (now, the Cordillera Administrative Region). BSU was one of the first pioneers in implementing the needed reforestation in Baguio and nearby areas.  It became the Mountain State Agricultural College in 1969 and Benguet State University in 1986 thru Presidential Decree (PD) No. 2010.



As mandated under PD No. 2010, the University shall provide graduate and undergraduate courses in the arts, sciences, humanities, and professional fields in agriculture, natural sciences, technology, and other technical and professional courses as the Board of Regents may determine and deem proper. It shall promote research, extension, agribusiness, and advanced studies and progressive leadership in various specializations.



Pursuant to CMO No. 27, s.2000, Buguias-Loo Polytechnic College was integrated as BSU-Buguias Satellite Campus in May 2001; while Bokod School of Arts and Trades was incorporated as BSU-Bokod Satellite Campus in January 2002.



BSU offers a total of 34 baccalaureate degrees: 25 at the La Trinidad campus, 4 at the Bokod campus, and 5 at the Buguias campus. For advanced education, 37 master’s and 7 doctorate degrees are offered by 8 colleges and 3 institutes. Eight Master’s degree programs are offered at the Open University.



Pursuant to COA Resolution No. 2011-009 dated October 20, 2011, the integrated results and risk based audit methodology has been adopted in the audit of the accounts and operations of the University for the period ended December 31, 2020.

C)	Opinion of the Auditor on the fairness of presentation of the Financial Statements 



We rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements of Benguet State University, for the year ended December 31 2020, due to the following:



--	The accuracy of the PPE and Inventory account balances presented in the Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020 with net book value of ₱6,731,866,892.44 and ₱21,362,963.35, respectively, is unreliable/doubtful due to partial and incomplete inventory taking and non-reconciliation with accounting records.



--	The ownership of the recorded land assets of the University totaling ₱2.694 billion is not clearly established due to unresolved land disputes and illegal occupancy by private claimants; hence, the reliability of the account balance at year-end is doubtful.



--	Dormant liabilities amounting to ₱34.107 million as of year-end, were not reverted to the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit, contrary to Executive Order No. 87, COA Circular No. 99-004 and Presidential Decree No. 1445. Thus, it raises doubts on the valuation and existence of the payables and adversely affects the fair presentation of the accounts in the University’s Statement of Financial Position.



--	Operating lease receivables in the amount of ₱13.9 million were not recorded in the books of the University understating the account and corresponding income account in the financial statements. Likewise, lapses in the monitoring/renewal/issuance of MOAs or contracts which are bases of preparation of bills affected the reliability of the operating lease receivables account balances and the collectability of rental dues for lack of lease agreements to enforce it.



--	Transaction documents establishing the University’s contractual right to enforce payment have not been established; thus, the validity of the recorded receivables amounting to ₱11.1 million is doubtful.



--	Four (4) motor vehicles procured by the Provincial Local Government Unit (PLGU) of Benguet turned over to BSU-BAPTC valued at ₱7,322,088.00 were not recorded in the books of the University contrary to the pertinent provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM). As a result, total assets were understated by the same amount.



D)	Summary of Observations and Recommendations



Other than the bases for qualifying our opinion on the financial statements, the following are some of the significant observations and recommendations:	

	

1)	The Deed of Donation executed between the Department of Agriculture (DA) and BSU which pertains to the building being occupied by BAPTC since 2015 is unenforceable due to unresolved issues affecting its turnover from DA to the BSU; thus, booking up and availment of GSIS coverage could not be undertaken.

	

	We recommended that Management endeavor to have a strong representation with the DA Central Office for the immediate resolution of the issues affecting the turnover of the building to the BSU.



2)	Cash advances in the aggregate amount of ₱1,512,339.16, remained unliquidated for more than five (5) to twenty-two (22) years due to non-submission of liquidation reports by former BSU Accountable Officers (AOs). As a result, the non-movement of the accounts for several years adversely affected the validity of the account balances presented in the financial statements as of year-end and the certainty of settlement becomes doubtful.



We recommended that Management initiate the following courses of action:



--	Direct the Accounting Section to immediately: a) draw adjusting/correcting entries to take up the reconciling items noted in prior years’ audit; b) conduct extensive analysis on the correctness of the beginning balances carried over through years for propriety of account balances; 



--	Pursue all means to locate the whereabouts of erring AOs including the institution of legal remedies, if necessary, to enforce settlement of their obligations to the University. Failure on the AO’s part to liquidate their outstanding accounts shall be a prima facie evidence that he has put such missing funds or property to personal use (RPC 217); and



--	Consider the option to request for write-off had there been proof of exhaustion of all remedies pursuant to the provisions of COA Circular No. 2016-005.



3)	Various COA Orders of Execution (COEs) received by the officials of the University were not strictly enforced,  contrary to Section 7.1.3 of COA Circular No. 2009-006; resulting in corresponding disallowances and charges totaling ₱3,229,433.06 which remained outstanding as of December 31, 2020.



4)	The approved installment payment scheme by the COA Legal Services Sector – PLO was not followed resulting in unsettled disallowances of ₱7,194,232.65 as of December 31, 2020 contrary to COA Resolution No. 2015-031.



We recommended that Management:



--	Enforce collection of the entire amount due from the persons liable to be paid directly to the BSU Cashiering Office upon receipt of this AOM;



--	Withhold payment of the salaries or any amount due the persons liable who are still with the University by the BSU Cashiering Office such as, among others, overload pay, subject to the minimum take home pay requirement under the General Appropriations Act; or



--	Collects the entire amount of the disallowance/charge from any of the persons liable under the subject COE without prejudice to their right to reimbursement from the other persons liable especially the approving officials.
