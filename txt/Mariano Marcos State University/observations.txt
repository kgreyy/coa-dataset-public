D)		Scope of Audit	

	

	The audit covered the period January 1 to December 31, 2020 and was conducted to ascertain the propriety of financial transactions and compliance of the Agency with prescribed rules and regulations.  It was also made to ascertain the reliability of financial records and reports, as well as, the fairness of presentation of the financial statements.  Our audit was conducted in accordance with the  International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs) and we believe that they provide reasonable bases for the results thereof.

	

	

E)	Auditor’s Opinion on the Financial Statements



		The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation  of the financial statements.

		

F)	Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations



The following are the significant  audit observations and the corresponding recommendations, which were discussed with Management officials concerned during the exit conference held on February 16, 2021, details of which are discussed in Part II of this report.  Management views and comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate.



1)	The Infrastructure Project “Construction of Auxiliary Buildings of the COE, CAS, CAFSD, CHS, and CASAT Colleges” of the University with a contract amount of ₱26,398,006.90 was awarded to an unqualified bidder which was not in conformity with Section 32.2.1 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, casting doubt on the legality of the procurement .



	We recommended that Management direct the BAC to strictly adhere to the provisions of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, in order to cast away doubt on the legality of the University’s procurement transaction.



2)		The BAC failed to post-disqualify the winning bidder in the construction of the Gymnatorium of the University with contract cost of  ₱17,790,704.17 for non-disclosure of awarded and on-going projects with other government agencies, in violation of Sections 23.1, 25.3(c) and 34.3 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No.  9184, resulting in the award of contract to a non-compliant bidder.

			

		We recommended that Management:

	

	a)		In its succeeding procurements, instruct the BAC and the TWG to ensure strict  adherence with Section 25.3 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184, in the conduct of post-qualification to include, validation of the Statement of On-going and Awarded Contracts through the use of PhilGEPs Open Data website and inquiry with other government agencies.

	

	b)		Impose upon the Contractor, the penalty of suspension without prejudice to the imposition of additional administrative sanctions as the internal rules of the agency may provide and/or further criminal prosecution, as provided by applicable law, and forfeiture of bid or performance security posted by the concerned bidder, pursuant to Section 69.1 and 69.2, respectively, of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184.



	c)		Direct the Internal Control Office to evaluate the process of post-qualification conducted by the BAC and TWG to determine the lapses in the processes undertaken and take action to address the same to avoid the repetition of awarding of contracts to unqualified/non-compliant bidders.

	

3)	The use of effectivity date  of appointment  as basis in computing  for the payment of salary and YEB differentials of 202 faculty members whose ranks were subject of reclassification  was  not in accordance with Sections 17 and  22 , Rule VI of the 2017, ORAOHRA (Revised 2018), resulting in the overpayment  of salary differentials of ₱10,148,927.01 and  over-remittance of personal and government shares with GSIS of ₱2,555,514.16, aggregating ₱12,704,441.17.

	

We recommended that Management:



	a)	Direct the HRMO to require the faculty who were on Study Leave to rectify/correct the dates of assumption of duties and oaths of office reported consistent with their appointments which shall be submitted to the Audit Team, for  evaluation.

	b)	Further, for the HRMO to comply with Sections 17 and 22, Rule VI of the 2017 ORAOHRA (Revised 2018).



G)		Status of Implementation of  Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations

	

				Of the 39 audit recommendations contained in prior years’ Annual Audit Reports, 21 were implemented and 18 were not implemented as of December 31, 2020.

	INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 

				

	

	The President

	Mariano Marcos State University

	City of Batac 

	

	

	Opinion 

	

	We have audited the financial statements of the University, which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020, and the Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity, Statement of Cash Flows and Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts for the year then ended, and Notes to the Financial Statements, including a Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

	

	In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the MMSU as of December 31, 2020, and its financial performance,  statement of cash flows, statement of changes in assets/equity, statement of comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs). 

	

	Basis for Opinion 

	

	We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs).  Our responsibility under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities of the Audit of the Financial Statements Section of our report.  We are independent of the agency in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified opinion.

	

	

	

	

	

	

	Key Audit Matters

	

	Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period.  These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

	

	Responsibilities of Management and those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements

	

	Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with IPSASs, and for such internal control as Management determines as necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

	

	Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the University’s financial reporting process.

	

	Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

	

	Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.  Reasonable assurance is high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

	2)	Cash and cash equivalents

--	It is expected to be used for more than one reporting period

--	It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to the entity; and

--	The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably.



Measurement at recognition

	    

An item recognized as PPE is measured at cost. 



A PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction is measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition.



The cost of the PPE is the cash price equivalent or, for PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction, its cost is its fair value as at recognition date.



Cost includes the following:



--	Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates;

--	Expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items; and

--	Initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired, or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that period.



Measurement after recognition



 After recognition, all PPE are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.



When significant parts of PPE are required to be replaced at intervals, such parts are recognized as individual assets with specific useful lives and are depreciated accordingly.  Likewise, when a major repair/replacement is done, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the PPE as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.



All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense in surplus or deficit as incurred.



Depreciation



Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.

The straight-line method of depreciation is adopted. For simplicity, depreciation is recognized for the whole month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month.  However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, depreciation shall be recognized in the succeeding month. 



The University uses the schedule of the Estimated Useful Life of PPE by classification prepared by COA with residual value equivalent to at least five percent of the cost of the PPE.



Derecognition



Items of PPE and/or any significant part of an asset is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected from its continued use.



	5)	Revenue from non-exchange transactions



Recognition and measurement of assets from non-exchange transactions



An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction, other than services in- kind, that meets the definition of an asset is recognized as an asset if the following criteria are met:



--	It is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential associated with the asset will flow to the entity; and

--	The fair value of the asset can be measured reliably.



An asset acquired through a non-exchange transaction is initially measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition.



Gifts and donations



Assets and revenues from gifts and donations are recognized when it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential will flow to the entity and the fair value of the asset can be measured reliably.



Transfers from other government entities



Revenues from non-exchange transactions with other government entities and the related assets are measured at fair value and recognized upon obtaining control of the asset, if the transfer is free from conditions and it is probable that the economic benefits or service potential related to the asset will flow to the agency and can be measured reliably.





	6)	Revenue from exchange transactions



Measurement of revenue



Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.



Sale of goods



Revenue from sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods and when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic benefits or service potential associated with the transaction will flow to the entity.



	7)	Budget information



The annual budget of the University is prepared on a cash basis and is published in the mmsu.edu.ph/about/Philippines transparency-seal.  These budget figures were those approved by the governing body and as subsequently legislated and authorized for execution as the General Appropriations Act provides. 



	8)	Employee benefits



The employees of the Mariano Marcos State University are members of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) which provides life and retirement insurance coverage.



The University recognizes the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits, like salaries, wages, bonuses, allowances and others as expense unless capitalized, and as a liability after deducting the amount paid.

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)	Financial Audit



          Non-Collection of Receivables aged more than five years – ₱8,171,606.16 



1)	Receivables amounting  to ₱8,171,606.16 aged more than five years remained uncollected as of December 31, 2020, resulting in the deprivation by the University of additional funds for its operation.



Analysis of the Receivable Account  of the University disclosed that  of the total amount of ₱15,569,449.71, receivables  amounting to ₱8,171,606.16 (Annex  A- Schedule of Uncollected Receivables)  aged more than five  years remained uncollected as of December 31, 2020.  Summary is  as follows:

We recommended  that Management:



1)	Instruct the Chief, Accounting Division to reduce the receivables by issuing demand letters and closely monitoring  settlements, thereof.



2)	After collection efforts and remedies have been exhausted for dormant accounts, request for possible write-off in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



3)	Consider the inclusions of collection targets in the University’s Key Result Areas and Performance Commitment to further reduce its outstanding accounts receivables.











		Management promised  that it will intensify its collection efforts, and if it  warrants, will request write-off  especially those accounts which have long been outstanding  in its  books of accounts for more than a decade. 



B)	Compliance Audit 



Award of Contract  to an Unqualified Bidder – ₱26,398,006.90



2)	The Infrastructure Project “Construction of Auxiliary Buildings of the COE, CAS, CAFSD, CHS, and CASAT Colleges” of the University with a contract amount of  ₱26,398,006.90 was awarded to an unqualified bidder which was not in conformity with Section 32.2.1 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, casting doubt on the legality of the procurement.



Section 32.2.1 of the 2016 IRR of RA No. 9184 provides that “The BAC shall immediately conduct a detailed evaluation of all bids using non-discretionary criteria considering, among others, the: Completeness of the bid. Unless the Instructions to Bidders specifically allow partial bids, bids not addressing or providing all of the required items in the Bidding Documents including, where applicable, bill of quantities, shall be considered non-responsive and, thus, automatically disqualified”.  



		  Review of the contract and contract documents on the Procurement Project “Construction of Auxiliary Buildings of the COE, CAS, CAFSD, CHS, and CASAT Colleges” of MMSU with a contract cost of  ₱26,398,006.90 showed, that some of the requirements/items contained in the Bid Proposal, Bill of Quantities, and Detailed Cost Estimates submitted by the Winning Bidder were incomplete and inconsistent with the requirements embodied in the University’s Plans and Program of Works, specifically, PLUMBING WORKS: Provision of  “Stainless Floor Drain with Strainer (4”x4”) 2 Septic Tank” for Auxiliary Buildings of the CHS and COE, showing a total cost difference of    ₱225,140.00.

With the noted discrepancies and/or inconsistencies on the bidding documents of the Contractor, the University Bids and Awards Committee (BAC), in the conduct of its detailed evaluation of all bids, should have considered said bids as non-responsive, thus, should have disqualified it.



	 Having awarded the above-mentioned Infrastructure Project to an unqualified bidder was not in strict adherence to Section 32.2.1 of  the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, casting doubt on the legality of the procurement.

		

	We recommended that Management  strictly adhere to the provisions of the 2016  Revised IRR of RA No. 9184,  in order to cast away doubt on the legality  of the University’s  procurement transaction.

	

Management commented that the Program of Work  and Cost Estimates were revised  and these were the documents used all throughout  from the Pre-Bid until the awarding of the contract.  

	

As a rejoinder laid down during the Exit Conference, the  Audit Team stood firm that in any call or need for a revision/change of an Infrastructure Project, it should commence from the very basic document - the Plan, not from the Program of Works and  Detailed Estimates, and that the two major project documents should be consistent  and in conformity with one another. Management was urged not to overlook the “basics,” but to conscientiously and scrupulously implement applicable provisions of RA No. 9184 in all its procurement projects, and fulfill its promise to be more vigilant in the future. 

	 

	Award of Contract to a Non – Compliant Bidder – ₱17,790,704.17

3)	The University BAC failed to determine the eligibility and to post-disqualify the winning bidder in the construction of Gymnatorium with contract cost  of ₱17,790,704.17 for non-disclosure of all awarded and on-going projects with other government agencies, in violation  of  Sections 23.1, 25.3(c), and 34.3 of the  2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, resulting  in the award of contract to a non-compliant bidder.

	

						   Section 23.1, 25.3(c), and 34.3 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No.  9184 provide, respectively that:

		

		 Section 23. 1. iv)  Statement of the prospective bidder of all its ongoing government and private contracts, including contracts awarded but not yet started, if any, whether similar or not similar in nature and complexity to the contract to be bid.

	

Section 25.3(c)  The Omnibus Sworn Statement executed by the bidder shall contain, among others: (c) Each of the documents submitted in satisfaction of the bidding requirements is an authentic copy of the original, complete, and all statements and information provided therein are true and correct. 



Section 34.3 The post-qualification shall verify, validate, and ascertain all statements made and documents submitted by the bidder with the Lowest Calculated Bid/Highest Rated Bid, using non-discretionary criteria, as stated in the Bidding Document[s].



				    On November 15, 2019, the University entered into contract for the construction  of its  Gymnatorium with contract cost of ₱17,790,704.17.  Review of the Statement of all on-going  Government and Private Construction Contracts submitted by the said  Contractor revealed, however, as supported by the positive Confirmation Reply of the District Engineer, DPWH 1st Ilocos Norte Engineering District, Laoag City to the University’s Confirmation Request of List of On-going Projects and COA Team’s validation from PhilGEPS Open Data Website, that not all on-going  government  contracts, including contracts awarded but not yet started, were disclosed by said Contractor, in violation  of Sections 23.1 and 25.3 (c) of the said Revised IRR  of RA No.  9184, detailed below:



	Project Title

	Owner

	Amount

	Remarks

	Cataban-Navotas (Bridge Construction) in support of bag making industry made from water lily and dried fish production, Laoag City, Ilocos Norte

	DPWH 1st Engineering District, Airport Avenue, Barangay  Cavit, Laoag City

	₱39,599,806.43

	Based from the positive Confirmation Reply sent by the Owner to the Univesity BAC.

	Repair/Improvement of Concession Building to be converted to CAAP Supply Office and Store Room

	Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), Cavit, Laoag City

	  ₱ 4,962,294.64

	Based from the PhilGEPS Open Data Website, specifically the Bid Notice and Award Details Report.



During the process of post-qualification, the University BAC and TWG  failed to post-disqualify the winning  Bidder, despite receipt of a positive Confirmation Reply  from the District  Engineer, DPWH 1st Ilocos Norte Engineering District , an utter disregard of Section 34.3 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No.  9184.

		

		Failure on the part of the BAC to determine the eligibility of the Bidder as required under Sections 23.1 and 25.3 (c) of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, and to post-disqualify said winning Bidder for non-disclosure of awarded and on-going projects with other government  agencies in violation  of Sections 23.1, 25.3(c), and 34.3 of the  2016  Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, resulted in the award of contract to a non-compliant bidder.

	 

		 Furthermore, the non-disclosure and/or withholding of information of all awarded and on-going contracts with other government agencies by the Contractor are subjected to sanctions and is ground for suspension pursuant to Sections 69.1 and 69.2 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, to wit:

	

			 69.1  During the competitive bidding stage, pursuant to Section 69 of RA No. 9184, the procuring entity shall impose on bidders or prospective bidders, the penalty of suspension for one (1) year for the first offense, and suspension of two (2) years for the second offense from participating in the competitive bidding process, as well as disqualification from further participating in the competitive bidding being undertaken by the Procuring Entity concerned, where applicable, for the following violations:

		

a)			Submission of eligibility requirements containing false information or falsified documents.

		

b)			Submission of Bids that contain false information or falsified documents, or the concealment of such information in the Bids in order to influence the outcome eligibility screening, or any other stage of the competitive bidding.

			 

 69.2   In addition to the penalty of suspension, the bid security or the performance security posted  by the concerned bidder or prospective bidder shall also be forfeited.	

			

					   We recommended that Management:

		

1)			In its succeeding procurements, instruct the BAC and the TWG to ensure strict adherence to Section 25.3 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No.  9184 in the conduct of post-qualification to include, validation of the Statement of On-going  and Awarded Contracts through the use of PhilGEPS Open Data website and inquiry with other agencies.

		

2)			Impose upon the Contractor, the penalty of suspension without prejudice to the  imposition of additional administrative sanctions as the internal rules of the agency may provide and/or further criminal prosecution, as provided by applicable law, and forfeiture of bid or performance security posted by the concerned bidder, pursuant to Sections 69.1 and 69.2, respectively, of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No.  9184.

		

3)			Direct the Internal Audit Service to evaluate the process of post-qualification conducted by the BAC and TWG to determine the lapses in the processes undertaken and take action to address the same to avoid the repetition of awarding of contracts to unqualified/non-compliant bidders.



			During  the exit conference, Management acknowledged  its omissions/lapses and assured compliance with  the Audit Team’s audit recommendations.

	

	Non-adherence to RA No.  9184 in the delivery of Consultancy Services – ₱1,378,764.35



4)	Delivery of  Consultancy Services  for  a QS Star Rating as a Star Institution costing ₱1,378,764.35  was  already initiated prior to procurement which was  not in adherence to  the 2016 IRR of RA No. 9184, casting doubts on the legality and  reliability of the transaction.



The 2016  IRR  of RA No. 9184, otherwise known as the “Government Procurement Reform Act” shall apply to all procurement of any branch, agency, department, bureau, office, or instrumentality of the GoP, including state universities and colleges (SUCs), and local government units (LGUs).

	

	 Review and audit of the documents relative to the delivery of Consultancy Services for a QS Star Rating  revealed the following: 



1)	MMSU, as a grantee of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) in its initiated Project “Fostering World Class Philippine Universities” which aims to ramp up the internationalization initiatives of public universities, through its President, signed on June 10, 2019 the “Authorization Portion” and agreed to be bound by the Standard Terms and Conditions of Service of the Proposal for QS Stars drafted and submitted  by Quacquarelli Symonds Limited, a global career education network and sole provider.



2)	As such sole provider of QS Stars Rating, Quacquarelli Symonds Limited, issued a Letter  dated November 19, 2019 confirming that it does not have any authorized reseller or distributor in the market for such or related services.



3)	The BAC of the University, in its Resolution No. 19-165 dated December 26, 2019 recommended to the University  President the use of alternative mode through Negotiated Procurement to procure said Consultancy Services. The recommendation was approved on December 27, 2019.



4)	The Notice of Award and Notice  to Proceed were issued on December 27, 2019 and December 30, 2019, respectively.



5)	The Consultancy/Service Agreement entered into by and between MMSU and Quacquarelli Symonds Limited was made and executed on December 27, 2019 as appearing on its face, but manually/personally signed and dated  December  30, 2019 by the Regional Director of the consultancy firm.  On the part of MMSU, the University President signed the Agreement without having indicated any date.



The notarial acknowledgments of said Consultancy Agreement were done separately for each signatory 



		 At this juncture, it must be noted, that the Proposal for QS Star submitted by Quacquarelli Symonds Limited specifically for MMSU which was signed and accepted by the University President on June 10, 2019, as mentioned in No. 1 hereof, is made an integral part of the Consultancy Agreement.  As such integral part, it can be clearly stated that the Proposal was already the “Consultancy Agreement” in disguise, which bound both the Contracting Parties to initiate delivery of their respective contractual obligations contained in the Proposal, as follows:



On the part of  QS 

	

	a)	Deliverables

 

QS will provide a report of the evaluation, namely:  The QS Stars Development Roadmap, indicating the institution’s overall result and performance with the audit as well as highlighting key strength and key areas of improvement.



--	Electronic delivery of the QS Stars Development Roadmap

--	Electronic delivery of the QS Stars Overall and Category Badges



	b)	Timeline 



Upon receipt of the contract, QS will initiate data collection process and MMSU will be given 14 week-period to provide QS with the data.  The QS Stars Development Roadmap and the QS Stars badges will be delivered 8 weeks upon receipt of final data or no later than 22 weeks after data collection is initiated.  The 2nd and subsequent badges will be delivered on the anniversary of the 1st badge delivery.



  On the part of MMSU



For and in consideration of the completion of the undertaking, and upon submission and /or surrender of any and all documents, files, reports, findings, certifications and recommendations relative to the undertaking, MMSU shall pay the QS  a one-time service/consultancy fee in the amount of ₱1,365,400.35.



Basing from the timeline stated in the Consultancy Agreement, delivery of the deliverables by the Consultant is for a period of 22 weeks (equivalent to 154 days) from contract date, that is, until May 2020.  However, delivery of the QS Stars Development Roadmap and QS Stars Badges was made by QS on January 10, 2020, barely 14 days from Contract date or  almost 140 days in advance, meaning the undertaking was already initiated prior to procurement stage, that is,  before execution of contract documents, in complete disregard of RA No. 9184, which requires procurement planning, processes, timelines, and procedures prior to execution/implementation/delivery of any goods, consulting services, and projects by the Procuring Entity.

	

The  above data  and  noted deficiencies/inconsistencies cast doubts on the legality and reliability of the University’s transaction in the procurement of its QS Star Rating as a 3 Star Institution.



We recommended that Management instruct the BAC, BAC  Secretariat and TWG to strictly adhere to the provisions of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184. 

			

					Management commented,  that would there be similar transaction in the future, will ensure to handle its transactions better and strictly comply with the provisions of the Government Procurement Law.

  

	 Overpayment of salary differentials and Year-End Bonus – ₱12,704,441.18

	

5)		The use of effectivity date of appointment as basis in computing for the payment of salary and Year-End Bonus (YEB) differentials of 202 faculty members whose ranks were subject of reclassification was not in accordance with Sections 17 and 22,  Rule VI of the 2017 Omnibus Rules on Appointments and Other Human Resource Actions (ORAOHRA)  Revised 2018, resulting in the overpayment of salary differentials of ₱10,148,927.01 and over-remittance of personal and government shares with GSIS  of  ₱2,555,514.17, aggregating   ₱12,704,441.18.

				 			 Section 17, Rule VI of the 2017 (ORAOHRA) Revised July 2018 provides,  among others:

		

			1)			Appointment shall take effect immediately on the date it was signed by the approving officer/authority.

		

			2)			No official or employee shall be required to assume the duties and responsibilities of the position without being furnished with a copy of his/her appointment by the HRMO after it is signed by the appointing officer/authority.  The appointee shall acknowledge receipt of the appointment by signing on the acknowledgment portion at the back of the appointment form. 



			3)			The appointment of officials or employees who are on official leave of absence, training or scholarship grant, shall be effective upon assumption or upon return from official leave of absence, scholarship or training.



Moreover, Section 22 of the same Rule states:



	The services rendered by any person  who  was required to assume the duties and  responsibilities of any position without an appointment having been issued by the appointing officer/authority shall not be credited nor recognized by the Commission and the payment of salaries and other benefits shall be the personal liability of the person  who made him/her assume office.



Records showed that  202 faculty members were granted  salary and YEB differentials covering the period July 1, 2019 to January 23, 2020  as a result of the reclassification  of  positions per National Budget  Circular (NBC) No. 461- Seventh Evaluation.  Said reclassification/modification was covered under DBM Notice of Organization, Staffing and Compensation Action (NOSCA) with  Serial No.  0102020-01-002 dated January 15, 2020 stating therein that Organization, Staffing Position and/or Compensation  modifications were approved and effective not earlier than July 1, 2019.

On the Clarification on the Effectivity  Date of Appointments in State Universities  and  Colleges  based  on  the  Implementation  of   NBC  461, CSC Resolution No. 2000052 dated January 21, 2020 was issued,  which provides in the dispositive portion thereof the following:



the Commission  RESOLVES that the actual date of issuance of Appointments  shall be indicated below the signature of the appointing officer/authority in the appointment form, but the effectivity of the reclassification to faculty positions in the SUCs shall be on July 1, 2019 based on the implementation of NBC 461 pursuant to the Special Provision  of the Miscellaneous Personell Benefits Fund in RA No. 10924.  



Audit of payrolls and the  supporting documents of all appointees disclosed, that the reckoning/cut-off date used in computing  for such salary adjustments was July 1, 2019,  the  effectivity date of reclassification stated in the CSC Resolution, instead of January 24, 2020, the date  when  the University President signed the appointments of the appointees, or the date of actual assumption of duties and oaths of office, and/or upon return from official leave of absence, scholarship or training per Sections 17 and 22, Rule VI of the 2017 ORAOHRA (Revised 2018). Per  attached  Oaths of Office and Certificates of Assumption to Duty, such were undertaken and  issued  prior to the date of appointments.



		Between the dates laid down in CSC Resolution  No. 2000052 and Sections 17 and 22,  Rule VI of the 2017 ORAOHRA, the latter  should prevail as  the  basis for the payment  of salary.  The CSC Resolution No. 2000052 provides only for the date given to SUCs to effect reclassification/modification to faculty positions and not to be construed, otherwise.



		Further review showed that of the 202 appointees, 27 appointees were on study leave, however, their Oaths of Office and Certificates of Assumption  to Duty were all dated July 1, 2019 prior to the issuance of their appointments in the absence of a supporting evidence/document of their actual return from official leave of absence, scholarship or training as required under paragraph 3 of Section 17  Rule VI, 2017 ORAOHRA (Revised 2018), casting doubt on the authenticity and validity of the actual dates of assumption reported.

	

The above-deficiencies were inconsistent  with Sections 17 and 22 of the 2017 ORAOHRA (Revised 2018), resulted in the overpayment of salary and YEB differentials in the total amount of ₱10,148,782.01.  As there were overpayment of salary differentials covering the period July 1, 2019 to January 23, 2020, consequently, there was over-remittance of personal and government’s shares in retirement and life insurance premiums with GSIS by ₱2,555,514.18.



The breakdown of total overpayments of ₱12,704,441.18  is shown hereunder:

			2)	Comply with Sections 17 and 22, Rule VI of the 2017 ORAOHRA (Revised 2018).



	Management commented, that it was deemed appropriate and right  to grant salary and YEB differentials on the date of approval of the reclassification by DBM which was as  early as July 1, 2019, since the implementation of NBC # 461 was long overdue.

	

	As a matter of rejoinder, the Audit Team maintains its stand that the effectivity date of appointment is governed by Section 17, Rule VI, 2017 ORAOHRA (Revised 2018), which should prevail. 



Invalid Payment of Mid-Year Bonus to  Scholarship grantees- ₱2,681,163.00



6)		The payment of Mid-Year Bonus to Scholarship grantees for CYs 2018, 2019, and 2020 totalling  ₱2,681,163.00 was  not in accordance with Items 4.2 and 4.3  of DBM Budget Cuircular  No. 2019-4, resulting in invalid disbursements.



Post-audit of disbursements on the payment of Mid-Year Bonus for CYs 2018, 2019, and  2020 showed, that the amount  of   ₱2,681,163.00   was granted to faculty and staff on Study Leave, although they did not render the required actual performance of duties of at least four (4) months for the period July 1, 2017 to May 15, 2018, and for the years thereafter which was not in accordance 

with Items 4.2 and 4.3 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2019-4 dated July 5, 2019.

	Items 4.2 and 4.3 of the Circular provide that:

	

	Item 4.2      A scholar who has rendered at least four months of actual performance of duties with at least a satisfactory rating for the period of July 1 of the immediately preceding year to May 15 of the current year, and is still in the service as of May 15 of the current year may be entitled to the Mid-Year Bonus.  Actual performance of duties means that the employee is reporting for work and actually delivering the services required of his/her position.



Item 4.3     A scholar with less than four (4) months of actual performance of duties for the period of July 1 of the immediately preceding year to May 15 of the current year, and is still in the service as of May 15 of the current year may be entitled to the Mid-Year Bonus, subject to the successful completion of the course program and fulfillment of the conditions stipulated in the scholarship contract.



 Scholarship grantees for CY 2018 of 21;  for CY 2019  of  24 , and for CY 2020 of 37 were paid the full amount of Mid-Year Bonus  although they did not render actual performance of duties of at least four months for the period of July 1, 2017  to May 15, 2018, and for the years thereafter.



	We recommended that Management stop the granting of Mid-Year Bonus to Scholarship  grantees who did not render  actual performance of duties to conform with Items 4.2 and 4.3 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2019-4, thus, avoiding irregular disbursements. 

	

			     Management commented,  that even though the scholars are on study leave, they have not severed their ties from MMSU, and that  they continue to contribute to the attainment of the performance indicators of the University,  particularly in the Organizational Outcome No. 1 which is Relevant  and Quality Tertiary Education to Achieve Inclusive Growth as indicated in its GAA Performance Targets for CYs 2018 - 2020. 

	 

	Further, it  commented that  the units earned by the scholars on study leave are used to strengthen  the faculty profile as required in various evaluation  procedures. Moreover, a strong faculty profile  is also required by other accrediting bodies.  In this light, the authorized full-time attendance of the personnel in scholarship programs is of utmost importance. 

	

During the exit conference, the Audit  Team, as its rejoinder, emphasized that there should be an  actual performance of duty  as required under  Items 4.2 and 4.3 of DBM  Budget Circular No. 2019-4 for the grantees to be entitled to the Mid – Year Bonus. 

	

Non-Submission of DVs/Payrolls within reglementary period – ₱189,625,311.60



7)	Disbursement Vouchers/Payrolls in the aggregate amount of ₱189,625,311.60 were not submitted to COA for post audit within the reglementary period, as required under Section 7.2.1a of COA Circular No. 2009-006, hence, validity, propriety of the recorded transactions of the University could not be ascertained. 



Section 7.2.1a, COA Circular No. 2009-006 provides:

	

		The Chief Accountant or other authorized official performing accounting and /or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that: a) the reports and supporting documents submitted by the accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of account and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten 10 days of the ensuing month.	



  Based from the submitted Report of Checks Issued (RCI) for all Funds  from  January-December 2020, it was determined that there are 1,447 disbursement vouchers/payrolls that are not yet submitted to COA as of reporting date, as presented below:

Validity, propriety and completeness of the recorded transactions could not be ascertained due to the non-submission of disbursement vouchers/payrolls within the prescribed period.



We recommended that Management require the Director, Financial Management Services to cause the submission of disbursement vouchers/payrolls to the Office of the Auditor within  the reglementary period provided under  Section 7.2.1a of COA Circular No. 2009-006, in order to ascertain the validity, propriety and completeness of recorded transactions.  



Management in its comment, is seeking consideration for the extension of the  10-day period to  submit  its transactions,  especially during year-end, and taking into account, as well,  the volume of their transactions. 



During the Exit Conference, the Audit Team expressed its understanding and concern about such situation of Management, but,  emphasized that implementation of government laws, rules and regulation is part and parcel of its constitutionally-mandated functions.



Improper Charges to Personnel Services (PS) Appropriation – ₱8,033,513.47



8)	Salaries of part-time and affiliate faculty, hired in substance  through Contracts of Service (COSs) in the total amount of ₱8,033,513.47 covering the period January to November 2020 were charged against Personnel Services (PS) appropriations which was not in conformity with Section 3.9, DBM NBC No. 578 and Section 2 of CSC-COA-DBM No. 1, s. 2018, casting doubts on the regularity and validity of the transactions. 



Section 3.9, DBM NBC No. 578 dated January 6, 2020 states:



Appropriations for PS under the FY 2020 shall be used for 

the payment of personnel benefits authorized by law to be given to National Government personnel including those that may be determined during the year.



Section 2 of CSC-COA-DBM No. 1, s. 2018 dated November 9, 2018 or known as Amendment to the CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2017 provides, among others:



Section 11.0 is hereby amended to read as follows:



	“11.0  Transitory Provisions



xxx 11.5 Services of individuals engaged through contract of service and job orders shall be paid salary/wage equivalent to the daily salary/wage of comparable positions in government and a premium of up to 20% of such salary/wage effective January 1, 2019.[T]he payment of services shall be charged against the Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses in the approved agency budge[t].” 



Said part-time and affiliate faculty were hired through a document issued by the University President labelled as “Appointment,” but, was not  prepared in accordance with the procedures and form  prescribed under RULE III (PROCEDURES IN THE PREPARATION OF APPOINTMENTS), Section 7 of the 2017 ORAOHRA, (Revised 2018).  So, their employment status could not be considered either permanent, temporary, coterminous, fixed term, contractual, substitute, or provisional.  Therefore, in truth and in principle, these part-time/affiliate faculty were hired through COSs or Job Orders and such engagement by the University of the services of said part-time/affiliate faculty did not create an employer-employee relationship.



Audit of disbursement vouchers and payrolls for the salaries of  said Part-Time  and  Affiliate Faculty hired,  in  truth and in substance,  through COSs covering the period from January to November  2020 in the total amount of ₱8,033,513.47  disclosed that said expenses were charged against PS Appropriations which was not in conformity with Section 3.9, DBM NBC No. 578 and Section 2 of CSC-COA-DBM No. 1, s. 2018, casting doubts on the regularity and validity of the transactions. 



We recommended  that Management direct the Budget Office to charge salaries/wages of faculty hired through COSs against MOOE in accordance with Section 2 of CSC-COA-DBM No. 1, s. 2018, and refrain from charging such against PS as prescribed under  Section 3.9, DBM NBC No. 578, in order to cast away doubts on the regularity and validity of the University’s transactions.

GSIS Premium Deductions and Remittances



In compliance with Section 5 (a) of RA No. 8291, otherwise known as the GSIS Reform Act of 1997, for  CY 2020, the University withheld the mandatory contributions totaling ₱31,517,490.18 from officials and employees.

Philhealth Contributions



The University had properly deducted  the mandatory Philhealth contributions from the monthly basic salary of officers and employees in the amount of ₱4,534,838.55,  and duly remitted same with the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation   in compliance with PhilHealth Circular No. 2019-0009.







Pag-ibig  Fund Contributions



Excessive Remittance of Government counterpart contribution  - ₱1,908,772.02



10)	The University  remitted excessive government counterpart contributions with PAG-IBIG Fund amounting to ₱1,908,772.02 which was not in conformity with Section 1, Rule VI of the IRR  of Republic Act (RA) No. 9679, otherwise known as the PAG-IBIG Fund Law, resulting in possible losses of government funds. 



 Section 1, Rule VI of  the IRR of RA No. 9679, otherwise known as the PAG-IBIG Fund Law, provides the following:

	

			 Rate of Contributions.  Covered employees and employers shall contribute to the fund based on the monthly compensation of covered employees as follows:



a)	Employees earning not more than One Thousand Five Hundred Pesos (P1,500.00) per month – one percent (1%);

b)	Employees earning more than One Thousand Five Hundred Pesos (1,500.00)  per  month – two percent (2%);

c)		All employers – two percent (2%) of the monthly compensation of all covered employee.



The maximum monthly compensation to be used  in computing employee and employers contributions shall not be more than Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000) Provided, that this maximum and the contribution rates  may be fixed from time to time by the Board  through rules and regulations adopted by it, taking into consideration actuarial calculations and rates of benefits.



 A member may, however, be allowed to contribute more than what is required  should he or she desire.



Review and verification of monthly payrolls and remittances to Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) of  Pag-ibig Fund contributions from January to December 31, 2020 disclosed that the government share for Pag -ibig monthly contribution of each official and employee was computed at 2% of basic salary or a maximum  of ₱300.00,  instead of, using the maximum monthly  compensation of ₱5000.00 in computing employee and employer contributions which should have been at ₱100.00 per employee and ₱100 as the employer’s counterpart contributions. This resulted in an excessive remittance of employer’s counterpart contributions of ₱1,908,772.02. 









Details are as follows:

Consequently, the  erroneous basis of computing government contributions resulted in the remittance of excessive government counterpart Pag-ibig contributions in the amount  of   ₱1,908,772.02. 



We recommended that Management:



1)	Require the Chief, Accounting Division to strictly comply with the provision of Section 1, Rule VI, IRR of RA No. 9679 in observing the maximum limit of PAG-IBIG contribution of  government share at ₱100.00 per month per official/employee.



2)	Instruct the Chief, Accounting  Division to set-up the corresponding “Receivable Account-Due to Officers/Employees” for the excessive contributions remitted which increased their respective total accumulated values with the Pag-IBIG Fund.



3)	Require the Finance Director to make the necessary representation with the HDMF to consider and treat the excess employer’s contributions remitted to it in prior years, as “Advance Payment” and be compensated/offset against future remittances of the University.



Property Insurance Law



For CY 2020, the buildings and structures of the University were insured with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS for fire, lightning, full earthquake, typhoon, and flood, in compliance with RA No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law as amended by the PD No. 245.
