C)	Scope and Objectives of Audit



The audit covered the accounts of operations of the CA for CY 2020.  The Audit was conducted to: a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements; b) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; c) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations; and d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.









D)	Audit Methodology



The audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs) issued by the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) of which the Commission is a member. Procedures were performed to obtain audit evidence about amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including assessment of the risks of material misstatement/s of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.  The audit procedures included internal control review; examination of documents/records/reports; analysis, confirmation and inspection of selected accounts, transactions and projects, as necessary.



E)	Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statement



The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the CA’s financial statements for CY 2020. 



F)	Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



Among the audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in Part II, the significant observations are summarized as follows:



			1)	The accuracy and reliability of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account balances totaling ₱38.299 million could not be ascertained due to unreconciled differences between the accounting and property records.  in the amount of acquisition cost/unit value aggregating to ₱4.742 million. (Observation No. 4)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Service (AS) and the Property and Procurement Section (PPS) to verify and reconcile the difference of PPE account balances, assign uniform property numbers to each item of PPE and make necessary adjustments in their respective books/records.



			2)	The accuracy of balances of Office Supplies, Drugs and Medicines, and Other Supplies and Materials Inventory accounts as of December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱424,726.79, ₱157,300.00 and ₱75,362.80, respectively, cannot be assured due to the unreconciled discrepancy of ₱226,641.38 in the balances of accounts and 11,130 in the quantity of items between the Accounting records and the Report on Physical Count of Inventory (RPCI). (Observation No. 3)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the: (a)  AS and PPS to reconcile the difference of ₱226,641.38 in the balances of inventory accounts and 11,130 in the quantity of items between the Accounting records and RPCI; and  (b) Inventory Committee to regularly conduct physical count/inventory and prepare the RPCI semi-annually and, any discrepancy noted, should be immediately investigated and reconciled with the records maintained by the AS and PPS, as required in Appendix 66, of the GAM, Vol II.



			3)	Cash advances totaling ₱330,597.09 for the accounts Advances for Payroll and Advances to Special Disbursing Officer (SDO) remained unliquidated as at December 31, 2020 as Accountable Officers (AOs) were not able to immediately refund the excess/unexpended balance of cash advances at the end of the year when the purposes for which they were granted have been served thus, making it susceptible to possible loss or probable misuse. (Observation No. 1)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountable Officers to fully liquidate their cash advances as soon as the purposes for which they were granted have been served through the submission of the liquidation documents and the corresponding official receipts evidencing refund of the unexpended/excess balances at the end of each year.



			4)	Cash advances granted for the operational requirements of the Offices of the CA Members were recorded as Advances to SDO account instead of Advances for Operating Expenses, thus affecting the accuracy of the Advances to SDO and Advances for Operating Expenses accounts at any given time during CY 2020 or prior to the liquidation of the advances. (Observation No. 2)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to record properly the granting of cash advances for the operational requirements of the Offices of the CA Members as Advances for Operating Expenses account instead of Advances to SDO, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 3 of the GAM, Vol. III.



			5)	The Due to Officers and Employees and Other Payables accounts balances of ₱5.992 million and ₱38,427.49, respectively, as at December 31, 2020 included payables that have remained outstanding for two years or more amounting to ₱21,138.50 and ₱2,265.40, respectively, which were not reverted to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to revert the Due to Officers and Employees and Other Payables aged two years or more to Accumulated Surplus or Deficit account in accordance with EO No. 87 dated August 13, 2019.



			6)	The CA was still not able to enforce Commission on Audit (COA) Order of Execution (COE) dated November 2, 2011 on the settlement of unliquidated cash advances totaling ₱3.496 million which remained outstanding for more than 20 years as of December 31, 2020. (Observation No. 6)



We recommended that Management:  (a) Require the Deputy Secretary for Administration and the Chief, Accounting Service to explain why the CA did not immediately act for the implementation of the COE issued on November 2, 2011;  and (b) Consider to enforce the COE issued by the COA General Counsel  against identified concerned responsible official/employee for the unliquidated cash advances totaling ₱3,496,199.99.



			7)	Copies of Purchase Orders (POs)/Contracts issued/perfected for the procurement of supplies, goods, property, services and other items were not submitted thus, precluding the Auditor from the timely review of these documents and the prompt communication of results to Management. (Observation No. 7)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief, General Service Office and other concerned offices to submit to the Auditor the POs/contracts and the corresponding supporting documents within five working days from the conformity/acceptance of the supplier/perfection of the contract in compliance with COA Circular No. 2009-001.



Other equally significant audit observations and recommendations were also noted and discussed in detail under Part II of this report.



The above findings and recommendations contained in the report were discussed with the concerned officials of the agency through meetings held on February 16, 2021 and March 23, 2021 and via phone calls during the implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) from March 29 to April 8, 2021. Management’s views and reactions were considered in the report, where appropriate.

The CA has no audit suspensions, disallowances and charges as of December 31, 2020.
