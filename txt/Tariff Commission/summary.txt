 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 

 

The Tariff Commission (TC), which is under the administrative supervision of the 

National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), is the primary 

government agency mandated to develop, formulate and coordinate the 

implementation of tariff policy in the Philippines by virtue of Presidential Decree 

No. 1 in October 1973.  The Commission is a fact-finding, recommendatory and 

advisory body that advises the President and the NEDA Board on tariff related 

matters. 

 

The TC conducts investigation and public hearings on petitions for the imposition 

of anti-dumping duty and institutionalization of safety measures to protect the 

national economy.  The Commission issues rulings and opinions on tariff 

classification.  It also conducts studies on the effects of import liberalization on the 

national tariff and competition policies and formulation of policy measures to 

protect the interest of domestic industries. 

 

For Calendar Year (CY) 2020, the TC is headed by Chairperson Marilou P. 

Mendoza, and composed of 80 personnel with no contractual and job order 

personnel hired.  The warm bodies are distributed among three divisions: 11 in the 

Office of the Chairperson, 32 in Finance, Management and Administrative Service, 

and 37 in Research Investigation and International Trade Analysis Service.

C. Scope and Objectives of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of TC for CY 2020.  The audit was 

conducted to (a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s 

assertion on the financial statements (FSs); (b) determine the agency’s compliance 

with laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency’s improvement 

opportunities; and, (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit 

recommendations. 

 

 

D. Audit Methodology 
 

We adopted a risk-based audit approached in the audit of the FSs of TC and in the 

review of compliance with laws, rules and regulations.  The Audit Team which 

carried out the audit, among others, (i) examined financial and accounting 

procedures adopted by the TC and other relevant documentation; (ii) assessed 

internal controls regulating financial operations and carried out compliance testing 

for determining the extent of control in operation; (iii) conducted substantive 

testing of a representative sample of selected transactions; (iv) carried out review, 

on test check basis, of a number of contract and transactions related to movements 

in balances of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses; and (v) conducted 

interviews and held discussions with the concerned officials and staff of the agency.  

 

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and the 

concerned officials thru the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda.

Subscription Expenses during the year  by the same amount. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Acting Chief 

Administrative Officer, Financial Management Division to: (a) observe the 

proper recognition of fund transfers to the PS for the procurement of 

goods/services and prepayments under the appropriate accounts; and (b) 

analyze the transactions and make the necessary adjustment for the 

unexpended/unexpired software subscriptions to correct the balances of the 

affected accounts.

Management officials in an exit conference conducted on April 8, 2021.
