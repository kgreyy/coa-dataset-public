OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
 

Financial Audit 

 

Accounting Errors 

 

1.       Accounting errors noted in the recognition of payments for ICT Softwares 

understated the balance of the accounts Prepaid Subscription and  Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) as at December 31, 2020 by P196,020.18 and overstated the  

Subscription Expenses during the year  by the same amount. 

 

International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 - Presentation 

of Financial Statements (FSs) defined accrual basis as basis of accounting under 

which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur and not only 

when cash or its equivalent is received or paid. Therefore, the transactions and 

events are recorded in the accounting records and recognized in the FSs of the 

periods to which they relate. 

 

COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 prescribes Volume III - 

Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) to replace Volume III-The Revised 

Chart of Accounts (Updated 2015) of the Government Accounting Manual for 

National Government Agencies. Volume III - Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 

2019), provides that Prepaid Subscription account is debited to recognize the 

amount advanced for the subscription of ICT software, data center service, cloud 

computing service, library and other reading materials, and the like, used in 

government operations and credited for the expended amount, and/or adjustments.  

On the other hand, the account Due from National Government Agencies is debited 

to recognize advances for purchase of goods/services as authorized by law, fund 

transfers to the National Government Agencies (NGAs) for implementation of 

projects and other receivables from NGAs. This account is credited upon receipt of 

goods/services, liquidation of fund tranfers, receipt of payment, settlement, write-

off, and/or adjustments. 

 

Analysis and verification of the accounts and transactions of the Tariff 

Commission (TC) disclosed accounting errors that misstated the year-end balances 

of the affected accounts. 

                      
Various software subscriptions purchased totaling P0.875 million were 

recognized as outright expenses instead of prepaid subscriptions.  At year-end, the 

remaining unexpired portions of the subscriptions amounted to P196,020.18. The 

details are presented in Table 1.

          Verification revealed that the payment to the Procurement Service for ICT 

computer softwares totaling P0.641 million was not initially recognized under Due 

from National Government Agencies but as outright expenses with a debit to ICT 

Software Subscription and a credit to Cash-Modified Disbursement System, Regular 

for P0.641 million instead of a debit to Prepaid Subscription.  At year-end,  only 11 

months of the subscription had been expended or had expired and one month  

subscription equivalent to P53,404.68 remained unexpended and will be carried to 

the next accounting period.  As such, Prepaid Subscription and Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) were understated by P53,404.68 and Subscription Expenses was 

overstated by the same amount. 

 

Moreover, as shown in Table 1, there were two payments for subscription of 

anti-virus softwares totaling P234,252.80 which were also recognized as outright 

expenses under ICT Software Subscription instead of Prepaid Subscription. One 

payment covering subscription for 12 months in the amount of  P142,615.50 

remained unexpended/unexpired at year-end as this was purchased only in 

December 2020. As a result, the accounts Prepaid Subscription  and Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) were understated by P142,615.50 and ICT Software Subscription 

was overstated by the same amount. 

 

Overall, Prepaid Subscription and  Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) were 

understated by P196,020.18 and ICT Software Subscription was overstated by the 

same amount.  

  

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Acting Chief 

Administrative Officer, Financial Management Division  to: (a) observe the 

proper recognition of fund transfers to the PS for the procurement of 

goods/services and  prepayments under the appropriate accounts; and (b) 

analyze the transactions and make the necessary adjustment for the 

unexpended/unexpired software subscriptions to correct the balances of the 

affected accounts.

2.      COVID-19 Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 

 

 

For CY 2020 TC had not received funds specifically for Coronavirus Disease 

2019 (COVID-19) response and recovery but had utilized its budget for related 

expenses.  The COVID-19-related expenses charged to Personal Services  and 

Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses totaled P112,759.00 and   P1.449 

million, respectively.  The results of audit of these COVID-related transactions are as 

follows:  

 

On the grant of hazard pay to employees during the ECQ/MECQ 

 

Administrative Order (AO) No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 of the Office of the 

President authorized the NGAs to grant COVID-19 Hazard Pay to personnel who 

physically reported for work during the implementation of the enhanced community 

quarantine (ECQ) in their respective work stations, in an amount not exceeding 

P500.00 per day per person.  Pursuant to the said AO, the TC issued Office Orders to 

formally adopt the guidelines in the skeleton workforce system at the TC and the 

reporting of employees to the office during ECQ (March 16 to May 15, 2020) and 

modified ECQ (MECQ) (May 18 to 29, and August 4 to 18, 2020). 

 

Review of the transactions recognized under Hazard Pay for  

CY 2020 disclosed that the TC granted hazard pay at P500.00/day totaling 

P112,759.00 to its 50 regular/plantilla employees who reported to office during the 

ECQ and MECQ.  

 

Verification of the pertinent disbursement vouchers on the grant of hazard pay 

showed that the payments were supported with Office Orders, accomplishment 

reports, payroll, Daily Time Records and the list of personnel with hazard pay. 

 

On the grant of laptops to employees during the ECQ/MECQ 

 

Section 3.1.e.3 of Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular 

(MC) No. 10, series of 2020 provides that the agency head shall ensure that the 

employees have access to or is provided with any communication equipment or 

facilities, such as computer/laptop, internet or e-mail, facsimile, telephone or mobile 

phone in order to facilitate the implementation of work-from-home (WFH) 

arrangement.   

 
On May 25, 2020, the TC purchased 35 units of mid-range laptops totaling 

P1.449 million from the PS for distribution to its personnel to support the Alternative 

Work Arrangement under the TC Business Continuity Plan including the WFH 

Scheme out of the FY 2020 General Fund.

3.      Gender and Development (GAD) 
 

Section 31 of the General Provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 11465, or 

the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020, provides, among others, that 

all agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) 

Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate, 

and implement the applicable provisions. 
 

The TC planned to undertake seven activities under its CY 2020 GAD Plan 

and Budget.  Of the seven planned activities, three were implemented while four 

were unimplemented. Expenditures totaled  P78,604.82 out of the allotted budget of 

P0.775 million on GAD-related projects which were integrated in the regular 

activities of the agency pursuant to the FY 2020 GAA. The GAD-related activities 

during the year are shown in Table 2.
