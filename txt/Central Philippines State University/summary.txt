D)	Scope of Audit



The audit covered the accounts and operations of CPSU Main, and its nine external campuses for the year-ended December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) ascertain the propriety of financial transactions and compliance with prescribed laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations. 





E)	Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the financial statements of CPSU for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to exceptions as stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report and as discussed in Part II of the report.







F)	Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



The following significant audit observation with the corresponding recommendation together with other observations and recommendations, are discussed in detail in Part II of this Report:



1)	Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) collections amounting to ₱133,487,625.00 were erroneously recorded and belatedly receipted, contrary to Section 68 of Presidential Decree No. 1445, thus affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements at year-end.



We recommended and Management, thru the University President, agreed to require the Collecting Officer to regularly monitor the collections in the RTGS so that the Official Receipts can be issued on a timely basis and report these in the Report of Collections and Deposits properly.  He should also direct the Accountant to, henceforth, record the RTGS collections by debiting Cash in Bank and crediting the appropriate Income/ Grants and Donation accounts.



2)	Income taxes on faculty and employees’ benefits were not correctly withheld contrary to Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 11-2018 dated January 31, 2018 resulting to overpayment of benefits totaling                              P429,848.66 and depriving the government of additional income taxes for its budgetary needs.                   



We recommended and Management, thru the University President, agreed to require the refund of the overpayment of the benefits and remit the same to the BIR upon collection thereof and to henceforth, require the Accounting Office to carefully review the computation of the payroll so that all benefits received by faculty and employees that exceed the P90,000.00 ceiling shall be applied with the correct amount of tax pursuant to BIR RR No. 11-2018 dated January 31, 2018.



3)	Monthly allowances paid to lawyers of the Office of the Solicitor General for legal services rendered amounting to ₱396,000.00 for the period January to December 2020 were not supported with proof of receipt, contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and Section 5, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume I, thus the validity of the disbursements cannot be established.



We recommended and Management, thru the University President, agreed to immediately request the OSG to submit the proof of receipt to acknowledge the monthly payments deposited to their Land Bank account amounting to ₱396,000.00 from January to December 2020, including other subsequent payments made in the succeeding year 2021 and to also submit other documents evidencing the services rendered by the OSG to CPSU in order to properly establish the validity of the disbursements made.  Moreover, the University President should also instruct the Accountant to prepare a correcting entry for the erroneous recording to Legal Expenses of prior year transactions.



The above findings as well as other observations were earlier communicated through Audit Observations Memoranda (AOMs).  Management comments were incorporated in this report, where appropriate.

	



G)	Gender and Development (GAD)



The Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) has endorsed the GAD Plan and Budget of the University in the amount of P1,311,400.00.  Management has successfully conducted GAD activities for calendar year 2020 with total expenses of P699,259.44 or 53.32% of the total GAD budget.





H)	Status of Settlement of Accounts



Unsettled audit disallowances and suspensions as of December 31, 2020 amounted to ₱396,423.60 and P123,035.72, respectively.  There were no audit charges issued during the year.
