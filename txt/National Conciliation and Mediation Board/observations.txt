OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT  

 

Accounting Errors, Omissions, and Misstatements 

 

1. Total misstatements of P326,774.34 were found in Inventories, Intangible Assets 
and Property, Plant and Equipment accounts of the NCMB due to accounting 

errors and omissions, thus affecting the accuracy, existence, classification, and 

valuation assertions on the reported balances of the affected accounts. The impact 

of such errors and omissions, however, is below the materiality threshold set, 

hence does not significantly affect the overall fair presentation of the financial 

statements as at December 31, 2020.  

 

1.1 Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 
National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, states that “The FSs shall 

present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an 

entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of 

transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 

recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in 

PPSAS.1” 

 

1.2 Moreover, Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that the 
accounts of the agency shall be kept in such details as necessary to meet the 

needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information 

needed by the fiscal or control agencies of the government. 

 

1.3 Audit of the NCMB’s financial statements (FSs) for the year ended December 
31, 2020 was conducted to verify the level of assurance that may be placed on 

Management’s assertions on the FSs. It was also aimed to determine the fair 

presentation and reliability of the NCMB’s FSs which responsibility rests with 

the Management. 

 

1.4 Audit of the accounts disclosed a total uncorrected misstatements/errors of 
P326,774.34 which affected the accuracy, completeness, classification, 

existence and rights and obligations of the year-end reported balances of 

Inventories, Property Plant and Equipment (PPE), Expenses and Accumulated 

Surplus accounts in the FSs, as summarized in the table below:

1.5 Section 4, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, on Financial Reporting, 
provides that the "Responsibility for the fair presentation and reliability of FS 

rests with the management of the reporting agency, particularly the head of 

finance/accounting office and the head of entity or his authorized 

representative." 

 

1.6 Section 6, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, on Qualitative 
Characteristics of Financial Reporting, states that “An entity shall present 

information including accounting policies in a manner that meets the following 

qualitative characteristics enumerated in PPSAS, 

 

Xxxxx 

 

e. Reliability – reliable information is free from material error 

and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully 

that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be 

expected to represent.   

 

f. Faithful representation – information to represent faithfully 

transactions and other events, it should be presented in 

accordance with the substance of the transactions and other 

events, and not merely their legal form. 

 

1.7 Moreover, Section 112 of PD No. 1445 provides that “Each government agency 
shall record its financial transactions and operations conformably with 

generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws 

and regulations.” 

 

1.8 The details of the misstatements and related accounting deficiencies and the 
corresponding specific recommendations are discussed further in the succeeding 

paragraphs. 

 

INVENTORIES 

 

i.  Unused stored Inventory items recorded issued at yearend- P98,024.94 
 

1.9 Ocular inspection of Inventories in RCMB – National Capital Region (NCR) 
conducted on February 16, 2021 revealed that there were unused office supplies 

worth P79,204.83 found in the Branch’s Stock Room, contrary to the zero-

account balance reflected in the books of the Agency. Further, the former 

Property /Supply Officer said that office supplies found in the Stock Room were 

already issued to end-users but were retained for safekeeping.  Admittedly, he 

said that he wants to zero out the inventory balance of office supplies so each 

and every office supplies in stock were distributed to the different offices even 

if they cannot immediately use and have no place for stocking. 



37 

 

1.10 Furthermore, although reported zero balance as at December 31, 2020, office 
supplies amounting to P18,820.11 were physically issued on January 19, 2021 

by the current Supply Officer, based on the Requisition and Issue Slips (RIS) 

presented. According to him, the inspected stored unused office supplies and the 

issued supplies in January 2021 pertained to inventories procured in CY 2020 

and prior years, emphasizing that there were no new purchases made yet as of 

end of February 2021. The unused supplies of P79,204.83 stored in the Stock 

Room and the issued supplies of P18,820.11 in January 2021, which totaled 

P98,024.94 should be part of Office Supplies Inventory balance as at December 

31, 2020, which was understated by such amount and the Accumulated Surplus 

for the supplies expenses recognized in CY 2020.  

 

1.11 We recommended that the Management of RCMB-NCR make the 
necessary adjustments to reflect the correct balance of Office Supplies 

Inventory and related accounts as of December 31, 2020. 

 

1.12 The Management of RCMB-NCR committed to adopt the aforementioned audit 
recommendation and shall require the Accountant–Designate to make the 

necessary adjusting entries to reflect the correct balances of affected accounts. 

 

INTANGIBLE ASSETS 

 

ii. PPE -ICTE item erroneously classified as Intangible Assets -₱210,000.00 
 

1.13 COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 or the Revised Chart of 
Accounts for National Government Agencies prescribes the use of the following 

accounts: 

 

“Information and Communications Technology Equipment - 

This account is debited to recognize the cost incurred in the 

purchase of information and communications technology 

equipment, which includes hardware (computers, printers, 

scanners, and the like) and pre-loaded software such as but not 

limited to operating systems which are included in the cost of 

the computer hardware, which met the prescribed capitalization 

threshold or fair value if acquired through donations or 

transfers without cost. This also includes data communications 

equipment and such other peripherals and auxiliary equipment 

necessary to put the system into operational mode. This account 

is credited upon sale, transfers, losses, destruction, 

derecognition of the carrying amount of the replaced portion, 

other disposal, and/or adjustments.” 

 

“Computer Software - This account is debited to recognize the 

purchase cost or capitalized development cost of computer 

software programs for use in government operation, when the 



38 

 

software is not an integral part of the related hardware. 

Development costs include cost of coding, testing and cost to 

produce product masters. This account is credited upon sale, 

transfers, obsolescence, and/or adjustments.” 

 

1.14 In RCMB IV-B, audit of the account Computer Software under the Intangible 
Assets revealed that the balance of P210,000.00 pertains to the acquisition cost 

of one (1) unit of Sophos SG-135 firewall appliance, with one-year full guard 

subscription, purchased on September 12, 2019 and fully amortized in one (1) 

year, thus having a zero net value as of December 31, 2020. 

 

1.15 However, inspection and verification of the technical specifications of the 
Sophos SG-135 firewall appliance disclosed that this is a hardware network 

security appliance, which consists of a single box with a number of ports or 

flexible port LAN modules for connectivity options and with integrated high 

speed hard drives for local storage, among others.  The one-year software 

subscription included in the purchase price of Sophos SG-135 is the computer 

software, which forms merely as an integral part of the said appliance/hardware. 

 

1.16 Thus, the firewall appliance, being a data communications equipment though 
coupled with one-year full guard subscription, should have been taken up as 

Information and Communication Technology Equipment rather than Computer 

Software pursuant to COA Circular No. 2020-001 or the Revised Chart of 

Accounts.  As such, its acquisition cost should also have been allocated over the 

estimated useful life of five (5) years as the accounting policy adopted by the 

Branch for the depreciation of its PPE, rather than amortizing the full 

P210,000.00 acquisition cost in just one (1) year as if the appliance has no more 

economic value or use at all. 

 

1.17 We recommended that the Management of RCMB IV-B require the 
Accountant-Designate to reclassify the firewall appliance to its proper 

account- Information and Communication Technology Equipment and take 

up the corresponding depreciation expenses pursuant to COA Circular No. 

2020-001 or the Revised Chart of Accounts.  

 

1.18 The Management of RCMB IV-B commented that the Accountant-Designate 
was instructed to make the necessary adjusting entries to correct the erroneous 

recording of the firewall appliance.  The Branch already submitted to the Office 

of the Auditor on February 15, 2021 the Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) correcting 

the balances of the affected accounts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 



39 

 

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PPE) 

 

iii. Issued Semi-expendable equipment in prior years misclassified as PPE 
 

1.19 Sec. 4, Chapter 10 – PPE, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that “The 
capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 represents the minimum cost of an 

individual asset recognized as a PPE on the Statement of Financial Position.” 

 

1.20 Section 10, Chapter 8 – Inventories, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs further 
prescribes policies for tangible item below the capitalization threshold of 

P15,000.00:  
 

a. Semi-Expendable property which was recognized as PPE shall be 
reclassified to the affected accounts.  

 

b. These tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon issue to the end-
users.  

 

1.21 Verification disclosed that properties purchased with unit cost below the 
threshold of P15,000.00 were recognized as PPE in the books of RCMB VIII. 

Semi-expendable ICTE and communication equipment amounting to 

P12,400.00 and P6,349.40, respectively, which are considered Inventories, were 

erroneously capitalized as PPE thereby overstating the PPE-ICTE account and, 

in turn, understating the Semi-Expendable ICTE and Semi-Expendable 

Communications Equipment accounts balances. However, the subject semi-

expendable equipment were found already issued to the end-users in the prior 

years, hence should have been expended already in prior years.  In effect, the 

ICTE account under PPE and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) were both 

overstated by P18,749.40, thus, affecting the reliability of financial reports. 

 

1.22 We recommended that the Management of RCMB VIII require the          
Accountant to record the issuance to end-users of the semi-expendables 

ICTE and Communications Equipment misclassified as PPE, recognizing 

the same as a reduction in the Asset accounts and in the Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit). 

 

1.23 Management of RCMB-VIII commented that the Branch Accountant-Designate 
was instructed to prepare the necessary adjustments to correct the affected 

accounts; and the Accountant-Designate and the Supply Officer-Designate were 

directed to conduct regular reconciliation of their respective accounting and 

supply records in order to avoid variances in the aforementioned accounts.

OTHER ACCOUNTING DEFICIENCIES 

 

2. Various deficiencies in accounting and property controls in the total amount of 
P12,989,769.45 were also observed, which affected the reliability of the year-end 

balances of Inventories, PPE, Liabilities and Expenses accounts.

INVENTORIES 

 

a. Stock Cards (SCs) for Inventory Items not maintained/updated 
 

2.2 Section 17 of Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, prescribes the records, 
forms and reports to be maintained for recording Inventories. One of which is 

the SC which shall be used to record all receipts and issues of supplies and the 

balance in quantity at any time. It shall be maintained by the Property and/or 

Supply Division/Unit for each item in stock.  

 

2.3 The Property Officer in RCMB–NCR failed to maintain/update the SCs, thus 
there was no record of receipts, issuances, and balances of office supplies 

inventories, which should facilitate the tracing and reconciliation of the Supplies 

Inventory and transactions with the Accounting records. 

 

2.4 We recommended that Management require the Property/Supply Officer 
to maintain/update SCs for recording the receipt and issues of Inventories. 

as required by Section 17, Chapter 8 of Volume I of the GAM; 

 

2.5 Management commented that the Designated Supply Officer was already 
directed to comply with the audit recommendation. 

 



42 

 

 

 

b. JEVs for inventories issued not supported with RIS and RSMI 
 

2.6 Section 17, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs prescribes the records, 
forms and reports to be used, such as the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued 

(RSMI). It shall be prepared by the Property and/or Supply Custodian based on 

the RIS and shall be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing 

the JEV to record the supplies and materials issued. 

 

2.7 In RCMBs NCR and VII, supplies and materials amounting to P332,463.49 and 
P237,625.89, respectively, were recorded in the books, even without the required 

RSMI and RIS as proof of issuance to the end-users.  

  

2.8 We recommended that the Management of RCMBs-NCR & VII require: 
 

a) the Accountant–Designate to submit the RSMI, RIS and required 
documents supporting the JEV for the issuance of supplies and 

materials inventories and semi-expendable properties in CY 2020; 

and 

 

b) the Supply/Property Officer to henceforth, require end-users to 
prepare RIS for all requisitions of semi-expendable inventories; and 

summarize all the accomplished RIS in the properly-accomplished 

RSMI and forward the same to the Accountant-Designate to 

support the recording of the issuance of semi-expendable 

properties. 

 

2.9 The RCMBs’ Management gave the following comments: 
 

RCMB Management Comments 

NCR The Management committed to provide the Audit Team copies of 

the JEVs with the required supporting documents for all supplies 

and materials issued in FY 2020. 
VII The Management commented that they will comply with the audit 

recommendations and rules pertaining to the preparation and 

issuance of RIS and RSMI.  

 

c. Non-issuance of ICS to end-user of Semi-Expendable Property 
 

2.10 Section 11, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, on the Accountability 
over Semi-Expendable Property, provides that the ICS shall be issued to end-

user of Semi-Expendable Property to establish accountability over them. 

Accountability shall be extinguished upon return of the item to the Property and 

Supply Division/Unit or in case of loss, upon approval of the relief from property 

accountability. 



43 

 

 

2.11 In RCMB VII, various Supreme Court Reports Annotated (SCRA) volumes 
amounting to P132,220.00 were issued to certain personnel without 

corresponding ICS. Issuance of the emi-expendable inventory not supported 

with ICS may put the Agency at a disadvantage since no responsible personnel 

may be held accountable, in case of loss.  

 

2.12 In RCMB VIII, purchased Semi-Expendable Properties and equipment 
amounting to P130,520.40 were issued to end-users without ICS. Due to absence 

of ICS as proof of actual receipt for official use by the custodian of the assets, 

the issued items are exposed to possible loss or misuse.  

 

2.13 Furthermore, ICSs, which are necessary in the proper monitoring of 
accountability, were not also accomplished in RCMB NCR for issued Semi-

Expendable items. Proper control/management in the custody and handling of 

the inventory items was not being practiced which may result in possible losses 

or misuse of government properties. 

 

2.14 We recommended that the Management of RCMBs NCR, VII & VIII to 
direct the Supply/Property Officer to issue ICS to the concerned end-user/s 

of various semi-expendable items to establish and monitor accountability.  

 

2.15 The RCMBs Management gave the following comments: 
 
RCMB Management Comments 

NCR The Management committed to adopt the aforementioned audit 

recommendations to require the Accountant–Designate and 

Property/Supply Officer to correct the deficiencies. 
VII The Management commented that the failure to issue ICS was only 

inadvertently made.  The Management committed to issue ICS relative to 

the issuance of the SCRA books. 
VIII Management said that the Supply-Officer-Designate is maintaining the 

required ICS.  However, he failed to attach the same in the disbursement 

vouchers (DVs). Further, the Management committed to issue a 

Memorandum requiring all personnel concerned to ensure that the ICS will 

be submitted as an attachment in the appropriate DV/JEV to support 

issuance of inventories and comply with all the existing COA rules and 

regulations on the matter. 

 

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 

 

d. Undisposed unserviceable properties under the PPE 
 

2.16 Section 79 of PD No.1445 provides the destruction or sale of unserviceable 
property which states that “When government property has become 

unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application 

of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or 



44 

 

his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, 

if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If 

found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under 

the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in the 

presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the 

Commission, after advertising by printed notice in the Official Gazette, or for 

not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of general circulation, or 

where the value of the property does not warrant the expense of publication, by 

notices posted for a like period in at least three public places in the locality 

where the property is to be sold. In the event that the public auction fails, the 

property may be sold at a private sale at such price as may be fixed by the same 

committee or body concerned and approved by the Commission.” 

 

2.17 Section 40 (d), Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, indicate that “All 
unserviceable property shall be reported in the IIRUP (Appendix 74). PPE 

reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books.”  

 

2.18 Unserviceable and obsolete properties totaling P687,054.54 under ICTE and 
Other PPE accounts, which have no future economic benefits or service potential 

is expected from their use, were still carried in the books, which were recorded 

at cost less the accumulated depreciation.  NCMB-CO and RCMB-NCR failed 

to undertake the prescribed procedures in Section 79 of PD No. 1445 for the 

disposal of the unserviceable items as basis to derecognize them as assets. 

 

2.19 The RPCPPE of NCMB-CO and RCMB NCR showed that PPE items totaling 
P513,379.54 and P173,675.00, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 pertain to 

unserviceable items consisting of computers, printers, etc., which were 

considered defective and were thus, returned by the concerned end-users. The 

unserviceable PPEs were still included in the RPCPPE. No separate Inventory 

and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) was prepared and 

submitted   to the Disposal Committee for their appropriate inspection/ appraisal 

and recommended mode of disposal.   Hence, in the absence of approved and 

actual disposal, the unserviceable PPEs were not derecognized/ dropped from 

the books. 

 

2.20 Further verification also showed that some of the fully depreciated computers 
returned by end-users were still being used by other Division offices, even 

without the required Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) issued to 

current end-users, hence, accountability thereof was not properly established. 

 

2.21 The prolonged storage of the unserviceable property or those no longer needed 
would unnecessarily lessen their expected disposal value due to speedy 

deterioration and/or possible loss. Waste materials found to be of value should 

have been disposed of at the earliest possible time to recover maximum costs 

and realize income from their scrap value. It also entailed additional costs for the 

additional storage spaces provided for them which could have been otherwise 



45 

 

used for other beneficial purposes. Likewise, the Agency is not relieved from its 

custodial responsibility over the items.  

 

2.22 We recommended that Management of NCMB CO and RCMB NCR to 
require the Property Officer to: 

 

a. accomplish the IIRUP for disposal of these properties and submit the 
same to the Disposal Committee for their appropriate 

inspection/appraisal and recommended mode of disposal; 

 

b. cause the immediate disposal of those unserviceable property in 
accordance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445 to prevent further loss of its 

economic value, and to enable the Agency to use the space presently 

being occupied by the said property for other beneficial purposes; 

 

c. prepare the required PAR for the fully depreciated but still usable 
properties issued to current end-users in order to establish 

accountability thereof; and 

 

d. determine which unserviceable properties can be transferred/ donated 
to another government entity then prepare the required Property 

Transfer Report. 

 

2.23 The Management commented as follows: 
 

Office/RCMB Management Comments 

CO Management commented that the Property Officer was 

instructed to determine all properties that are considered 

disposable by identifying those properties which are no 

longer serviceable, beyond repair and no more utilization 

potential, became obsolete or outmoded due to changes in 

technology and those properties that were classified as 

unnecessary.  The Property Officer was also instructed to 

update the PAR on or before March 31, 2021, especially fully 

depreciated yet serviceable items which were already 

returned by previous end-users and later transferred to other 

end-users. Further, the Disposal Committee was directed to 

inspect all unserviceable properties and recommend the 

mode/manner and eventual disposal thereof, on or before 

June 30, 2021. 
NCR The Management shall comply with the audit 

recommendations and submit the required documents to the 

Audit Team. 

 

 

 



46 

 

e. Unreconciled PPE account balances per books and RPCPPE 
 

2.24 Section 58, Chapter 2 of PD No.1445 on the Audit of Assets states that “The 
examination and audit of assets shall be performed with a view to ascertaining 

their existence, ownership, valuation and encumbrances as well as the propriety 

of items composing the respective asset accounts; determining their agreement 

with records; proving the accuracy of such records; ascertaining if the assets 

were utilized economically, efficiently and effectively; and evaluating the 

adequacy of controls over the accounts.” 

 

2.25 In Section 42(g) of Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, on the 
Accounting and Property Records to be maintained for PPE, the RPCPPE is one 

of the forms/reports necessary to account for PPE. The RPCPPE shall be used to 

report the physical count and condition of PPE by type as at a given date, 

including those which are unrecorded and those which could not be accounted 

for. It shows the balance of PPE per Property Cards and per count and the 

shortage/overage, if any. It shall be rendered by the Inventory Committee on its 

yearly physical count of properties owned by the entity 

 

2.26 In RCMBs NCR, VI and VIII, PPE accounts with a total book balance of 
P5,778,728.76 do not reconcile with the balances per RPCPPE/Property Supply 

Record of P5,615,754.35or a difference of P162,974.41, as shown below:

2.27 In NCMB – NCR, the Property Officer said that the said variance of P40,825.00 
pertains to a disposed Computer Desktop under Serial No. 

DTVE0SP026318009209200. However, said PPE item may only be removed 

from the books when approved disposal is duly supported with the accomplished 

IIRUP, which will serve as the basis of the Accounting Office to derecognize the 

asset. 

 
2.28 The difference of P103,400.01 noted in RCMB VI represents the book balance 

of IT Software “Adobe Creative Cloud” in the amounts of P51,000.00 and 

P52,400.00, acquired by the Agency on October 27, 2017 and December 31, 

2018, respectively, that were already fully amortized, and the P.01 unreconciled 



47 

 

balance in prior years. The designated Accountant said she informed the Audit 

Team that the said Adobe Creative Cloud which was originally re-classified 

from IT Equipment and Software to ICTE was inadvertently not transferred to 

its proper account classification - Intangible Assets: Computer Software. 

 

2.29 The variance of P18,749.40 in RCMB VIII were Semi-Expendable Information 
& Communication Technology and Communication Equipment issued to end-

users, which individual amounts fall below the capitalization threshold of 

P15,000.00 but were erroneously capitalized as PPE account. 

 

2.30 The unreconciled   supply records particularly the RCPPE and the accounting 
records cast doubt on the existence and reliability of the PPE account balances 

as reflected in the Agency’s books and financial statements as of yearend. 

 

2.31 We recommended that Management require the Accountant and the 
Property/Supplier Officer to have their records regularly reconciled to 

facilitate the conduct of physical count, as required in COA Circular No. 

2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 and the PPE account balances adjusted as 

necessary. 

 

2.32 The RCMBs’ Management gave the following comments: 
 
RCMB Management Comments 

NCR The Management committed that both Accounting and Property 

Units will regularly reconcile their records to facilitate the conduct 

of physical count on a semestral basis.  
VI Management informed the Audit Team that prior year unreconciled 

difference of P.01 was already identified and accordingly adjusted. 

Nevertheless, Management agreed that in order to prevent 

inconsistencies in the book balances, both the Accountant-Designate 

and the Supply Officer-Designate commit to conduct regular 

reconciliation of balances on PPEs and to religiously observe the 

proper classifications of the same. 

 

Furthermore, Management submitted the updated RPCPPE – 

Information and Communication Technology Equipment and Office 

Equipment and the General Journal/JEVs for the adjustments made 

for the recommended reclassifications of identified PPEs and 

corrections of overstatement in the ICTE account.  



48 

 

RCMB Management Comments 

VIII The Branch committed to adjust the Semi-Expendable Information 

& Communication Technology and Communication Equipment 

amounting to P12,400.00 and P6,349.40, respectively, erroneously 

capitalized as PPE account. 

 

Management said that they will direct the Accountant-Designate and 

the SupplyOfficer-Designate to conduct reconciliation between the 

Accounting and Supply records in order to avoid variances in the 

aforementioned accounts. 

 

f. Non-maintenance/not updated PPELC, PC and PAR 
 

2.33 Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of the same Manual also requires that “The 
Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPE Ledger Card (PPELC) for each 

category of PPE xxx.  The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the 

acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life depreciation, impairment 

loss, disposal and other information about the assets.  For check and balance, 

the Property and Supply Officer/Unit shall likewise maintain Property Card 

(PC) for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the 

same.  The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the 

Accounting Division/Unit.  They shall also be reconciled with other property 

records like Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR).”  

 

2.34 In RCMB IV-A, the PPELCs were not maintained by the Accounting 
Office/Unit contrary to Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 

I. 

 

2.35 Inspection and inquiry on the records maintained by the RCMB-NCR pertaining 
to their PPE accounts revealed that although PPELCs are being maintained by 

the Accounting Unit, the counterpart PC were not maintained by the Property 

Office, hence there are no property records to compare and trace the items in the 

RPCPPE and to reconcile the PPE items totaling P2,981,713.21 as per PPELC. 

Furthermore, PARs were not maintained/updated by the Management of RCMB 

NCR. 

 

2.36 The failure of the Accounting and Supply/Property Units to maintain complete 
and up-to-date records on the Agency’s properties cast doubt on the reliability 

of the reported PPE balances and cast doubt on the integrity of the property 

records.  

 

2.37 We recommended that Management require the Accountant-Designate of 
RCMB –IV-A to prepare and maintain PPELC for all PPE accounts; and 

the Property/Supplier Officer of RCMB-NCR to maintain/update the PARs 

and PCs as required by Section 42, Chapter 10 of Volume I of the GAM. 

 



49 

 

2.38 The Management of RCMB NCR committed to comply with the 
abovementioned audit recommendations by instructing the Property/Supply 

Officer to maintain the required PAR and PC.  

 

2.39 Likewise, Management of RCMB IV-A commented that they will prepare and 
maintain the required PPLEC for each type of PPE accounts. The Management 

also committed to strictly adhere to the GAM for NGAs. 

 

g. Variance in the value of PPE in the RPCPPE and PAR 
 

2.40 Comparison of the properties reported in the RPCPPE of RCMB IV-B as against 
the PARs acknowledged by the end-users showed a net variance of ₱9,400.00, 

presented as follows:

2.41 The acquisition cost of some equipment were not reflected in some of the PARs, 
hence there is variance in the value of certain equipment reported in the RPCPPE 

as against the PARs acknowledged by the respective end-users, and they were 

not aware of the correct amount of their accountability over the PPEs issued to 

them.  

 

2.42 We recommended and the Branch Director of RCMB IV-B agreed to 
require the Supply and Property Officer - Designate to reflect the correct 

amount of the subject equipment in the PARs and include the PPE found at 

station in the RPCPPE to properly establish the accountability of the 

respective end-users. 
 



50 

 

2.43 The Management submitted on February 15, 2021 to the Audit Team the revised 
RPCPPE which already includes the firewall appliance and the revised PARs for 

properties issued to end-users. 

 

h. No JEVs and schedules to support depreciation expenses for CY 2020 
 

2.44 In RCMB–NCR, the depreciation expenses recognized for CY 2020 totaling 
P559,767.80 for PPEs were not supported with JEVs and all the required 

schedules that must be attached to them. Both documents were not submitted to 

the Audit Team, hence cast doubt on the reliability and validity of depreciation 

expense and accumulated depreciation, thus affecting the carrying amount of the 

PPE accounts. 

 

2.45 We recommended that RCMB–NCR Management require the Accountant–
Designate to provide the Audit Team with the JEV supported with the 

required documents in the provision of CY 2020 Depreciation Expenses for 

PPE.  

 

2.46 The Management committed to comply with the abovementioned audit 
recommendations by instructing the Accountant-Designate to submit the JEV 

and the required attachments for CY 2020 depreciation expenses. 

 

2.47 The Accountant-Designate already submitted to the Audit Team the JEVs to 
record the depreciation expenses of PPEs for CY 2020 and the corresponding 

Depreciation Schedule. 

 

i. Property Identification Tags not updated 
 

2.48 The use of Property Identification Tags on properties/asset is a sound internal 
control tool in checking the integrity of custodianship of PPE, to monitor their 

whereabouts, to prevent loss, theft or unauthorized transfers and to facilitate 

inventory count and reporting. 

 

2.49 The Audit Team’s ocular inspection in RCMB-NCR disclosed that the Agency’s 
properties totaling P7,493,003.99 were not labelled/tagged with updated 

Property Identification Tags. The present property tags lacked data/information 

such as the date of count and the signature/printed name of the personnel who 

conducted the physical count of the asset. Further, there were some properties of 

the Agencies without any property tag at all. 

 

2.50 We recommended that Management direct the Property Custodian/Supply 
Officer to update the Property Identification Tags to properly monitor the 

assets, prevent loss, theft and/or unauthorized transfers and facilitate the 

maintenance of accurate records pursuant to the above cited regulations. 
 



51 

 

2.51 The Management already instructed the Property Custodian/Supply Officer to 
update the Property Identification Tags to properly monitor the assets, prevent 

loss, theft and/or unauthorized transfers.  He was also directed to maintain all the 

forms, record and reports required. 

 

j. Failure to conduct Physical Count of PPE 
 

2.52 There was no physical count of PPE conducted or completed in RCMB VIII, 
hence no RPCPPE submitted as of December 31, 2020.  In the absence of a 

physical count and the RPCPPE, the existence, validity and reliability of the PPE 

account balances of P3,088,132.00 as of December 31, 2020 presented in the 

FSs cannot be ascertained. 

 

2.53 We recommended that Management require the Inventory Committee or 
concerned personnel to conduct physical count of PPE; prepare the 

RPCPPE as of December 31, 2020 and reconcile with the Accounting 

records and PPELCs to assure that the PPE balances as at yearend are all 

existing, valid and reliable and that discrepancies that may be noted 

between the RPCPPE and PPELCs are adjusted accordingly. (RCMB VII)  
 

2.54 Management commented that they shall adhere with the audit recommendations. 
A Memorandum shall be issued directing all personnel concerned to conduct 

physical count of PPEs, and to prepare and submit the required Report on the 

Physical Count of PPE as of December 31, 2020. 

 

k. Missing PPE Items during the Physical Count 
 

2.55 Based on the available data in the PPE Ledgers and RPCPPE of RCMB-NCR, it 
was discovered that six listed PPE items costing P242,824.81 with carrying 

amount of P40,774.72 were missing during the physical count conducted on 

January 26, 2021 by the Inventory Committee. 

 

2.56 The former Property Custodian/Supply Officer narrated that one of the missing 
Desktop Computers with Property No. COM-035 was pulled out from the Office 

and returned to the Supplier for replacement. However, acknowledgement slip 

or any documentary evidence showing receipt therein by the Supplier that will 

prove veracity of his statement was not available for validation by the Audit 

Team.  While the missing laptop was issued to a Conciliation-Mediator who 

already requested for Relief from Property Accountability from this Office on 

February 24, 2015 but was returned for compliance with the requirements set 

forth in an Indorsement letter dated March 5, 2015 of the then Audit Team 

Leader (ATL). 

 

2.57 We recommended that Management of RCMB-NCR hold accountable the 
Property/Supply Officer for the four units missing PPE items. 

 



52 

 

Management comments: 
 

2.58 The Management committed to locate the missing items of PPE, and in case not 
found, officers/staff will be held accountable therefor. The Property/Supply 

Officer shall exert utmost effort to locate the missing PPE items.   

 

2.59 With regard to Computer Desktop Lenovo B320 All-in-One Desktop PC with 
Property No. COM010, the same had already been found. 

 

2.60 Moreover, HP Pro One 400 G3 20-inch Non-touch AIOPC, with Property No. 
COM-035 (SN8CG827CMXF), the same is not missing but pulled out for 

replacement. Despite earnest efforts to locate the gate pass, the same proved 

futile. We herewith attached the photocopy of security guard's logbook on April 

3, 2019, which states: "16:35H" CO Paul Abano, pull-out HP All in One PC. 

SN8CG827CMXF". The Branch will coordinate with the Supplier for its 

return/replacement. Con-Med Reñido shall submit the necessary documents for 

the request for Relief of Property Accountability. 

 

l. Misclassification of PPEs  
 

2.61 In RCMB VI, PPE accounts Office Equipment and Computer Software amounting 
to P71,990.00 and P317,400.00 were erroneously classified as ICTE both in the 
books of the Agency and in the RPCPPE. The erroneous classification of PPE in 

its proper account/s will render the accounts unreliable. 

 

2.62 The designated Accountant informed the Audit Team that the said Adobe Creative 
Cloud which was originally reclassified from IT Equipment and Software to ICTE 

was inadvertently not transferred to its proper account classification - Intangible 

Assets: Computer Software. Furthermore, the account title used in the RPCPPE 

was not updated from IT Equipment to ICTE. 

 

2.63 We recommended and the Management of RCMB VI agreed that the 
Accountant-Designate reclassify the listed PPE items from ICTE to Office 

Equipment and update the IT Equipment and Software accounts used in the 

RPCPPE to ICTE account. 

  

2.64 Management submitted the updated Report on the Physical Count of PPE – ICTE 
and Office Equipment and the General Journal/JEVs for the adjustments made 

for the recommended reclassifications of identified PPEs and corrections in the 

ICTE account.  

 

m.  Serviceable PPE tagged without value, not recorded in the books 
 

2.65 Section 14 of IPSAS 17 provides the recognition criteria for PPE stating that “the 
cost of an item of PPE shall be recognized as an asset if, and only if: (a) It is 

probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated with the 



53 

 

item will flow to the entity; and (b) The cost or fair value of the item can be 

measured reliably.” 

 

2.66 Further, Sections 26 and 27 of the same IPSAS provide that at the time the PPE 
qualifies to be recognized as an asset, it shall be measured its cost, otherwise, 

when it is acquired through “a non-exchange transaction, its cost shall be 

measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition.” 

 

2.67 Verification of the RPCPPE of RCMB IX as of December 31, 2020 disclosed two 
air conditioning units currently in use by the Office but were tagged without any 

value. Reconciliation of the RPCPPE and the books, also showed that these 

properties are not recorded in the books of accounts of the Agency.  

 

2.68 Inquiry with the Supply Officer and the Accountant-Designate revealed that the 
air conditioning units were not booked up because the Agency did not have any 

supporting documents to determine the cost of the items. Further, ownership   was 

not established to whom the units really belong. Review of the contract of lease 

between NCMB RB IX and the lessor showed no discussion of air conditioning 

units already provided by the lessor. 

 

2.69 Based on the foregoing, the air conditioning units qualify as PPE of the Agency 
because these items provide service/economic benefits to the Office, while the cost 

or fair value of the item can be measured reliably using some benchmarks as cost 

references.  

 

2.70 We recommended that Management of RCMB IX direct the Supply Officer 
and the Accountant-Designate to determine the ownership of the two air 

conditioning units and if it is settled that there is no claimant, then require 

the Accountant to record the PPE items in the books of the Agency. 

 

2.71 As early as March 2020, the Regional Branch Director instructed the Supply 
Officer-Designate and the Accountant-Designate to ensure that properties which 

were not booked up, should be recorded in the books immediately. Unfortunately, 

they were not able to retrieve any records to show that the two air conditioning 

units were indeed bought by the Branch despite earnest efforts to locate the same.  

 

2.72 Considering that there is no private claimant of the said properties and they have 
been in the Office premises since 2013 according to the Branch personnel, the 

Branch will record these properties in the books as found at station according to 

their fair market value. 

 

n. Procured ICTE recorded as Expenses 
 

2.73 In RCMB VIII, the procured operating system for the new office computer 
costing P5,740.00 was recorded as Subscription Expenses, instead of equipment 

under the account ICTE, details are presented in the next page.

2.74 At the time of purchase of the computer, the operating system Microsoft Office 
was billed separately by the supplier. The item was recorded as expense, but this 

should be included in the cost of computer, for the computer will not run without 

the operating system.  

 

2.75 We recommended that the Management of RCMB VIII make the necessary 
adjustments to the affected PPE and Accumulated Surplus accounts. 

 

2.76 The Management of RCMB VIII commented that the Accountant-Designate was 
already directed to make the necessary adjusting entries to correct the balances 

of the affected accounts. 

 

LIABILITIES 

 

o. Erroneous classification of Due to Officers and Employees to Accounts Payable 
 

2.77 Chapter 3 of GAM, Vol. III, provides that “Due to Officers and Employees is 
the account used to recognize incurrence of liability to officers and employees 

for salaries, benefits and other emoluments including authorized expenses 

advances by the officers and employees.” Likewise, “Accounts Payable is used 

to recognize receipt of goods or services on account in a normal course of trade 

and business operations.” 

 

2.78 Analysis of Accounts Payable in RCMB XIII disclosed that the Agency has an 
unpaid obligation to its internal creditors amounting to ₱40,000.00 which were 

classified as “Accounts Payable.”  Further, review of the account disclosed that 

the accounts payable recorded in the books of accounts were for payment of 

Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) to Officers and Employees, thus it 

should be recorded as “Due to Officers and Employees.”  Moreover, the entries 

made both in the General Journal and General Ledger affirmed the 

misclassification of accounts. 

 

2.79 As a result, the account balances of Accounts Payable and Due to Officers and 
Employees were overstated and understated, respectively, by ₱40,000.00, which 

affected the fair presentation of the said accounts in the FSs. 

 

2.80 We recommended that Management of RCMB XIII require the 
Accountant-Designate to adjust the affected liability accounts for 

correctness and accuracy in the presentation of the financial reports. 

 



55 

 

2.81 Management of RCMB XIII commented that the books of accounts will be 
corrected and adjusted to the appropriate classifications and assures the Audit 

Team that all transactions are appropriately and consistently recorded in the 

books of accounts in accordance with the classification of the IPSAS. 

 

2.82 Adjusting entry has been made in February 2021. 
 

p.  Accounts Payable aged more than two years and without supporting documents 
not reverted 

 

2.83 Section 98 of PD No. 1445 states that “The Commission upon notice to the head 
of agency concerned, may revert to the unappropriated surplus [Accumulated 

Surplus] of the general fund of the national government, any unliquidated 

balance of accounts payable in the books of the national government, which has 

been outstanding for two years or more and against which no actual claim, 

administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by perfected 

contract on record.” 

 

2.84 Executive Order (EO) No. 87, s. 2019 dated August 13, 2019 provides that all 
accounts payable which remain outstanding for two years or more in the books 

of national government agencies be reverted to the accumulated surplus or 

deficit of the general fund, or the cumulative result of operations of the national 

government.  

 

2.85 Accounts Payable in RCMB-NCR totaling P52,458.80 were recorded in CYs 
2017 to 2019 without the necessary supporting documents. Inclusion of the said 

payables which had been long outstanding and without the necessary supporting 

documents renders the validity and reliability of the Payables account doubtful.  

 

2.86 Analysis of the Aging Schedule of Accounts Payable of RCMB–NCR as of 
December 31, 2020 disclosed that payables amounting to P42,458.80 pertaining 

to CYs 2018 and 2019 were all recorded based on estimated amounts instead of 

the actual billing documents/statement of accounts. Hence, due to the 

approximations made, resulted either in excess obligations or underestimated 

obligations by Management to the concerned payees. The actual obligations 

were already paid and yet the excess obligated amounts were not reverted to the 

Accumulated Surplus of the General Fund.  Details are as follows:

2.87 In addition to that, Accounts Payable totaling P10,000.00, which pertains to 
subscription of newspapers for January to December 2018 was recorded as 

obligations in 2018 without the necessary supporting documents. Hence, said 

practice affected the validity and reliability of the recorded liabilities. 

 

2.88 We recommended that Management of RCMB-NCR require the 
Accountant to: 

 

a. revert to the Accumulated Surplus of the General Fund the long 
outstanding payables and those not supported with the required 

documents pursuant to Section 98 of PD No. 1445 and EO No. 87, s. 

2019 dated August 13, 2019; and 

 

b. monitor the aging schedule of payables in order to avoid the delay in 
the settlement/reversion of such payables. 



57 

 

2.89 The Management commented that adjusting entries were already made to reflect 
the correct balance of the Accounts Payable per JEV Nos. 2021-01-039 and 040 

both dated January 31, 2021 totaling P60,301.19 and P(7,842.40), respectively. 

The Branch’s Accountant-Designate was also instructed to take extra care in 

recording financial transactions and process only claims with complete 

supporting documents. On March 4, 2021, the RCMB-NCR informed thru email, 

all the claimants with outstanding payables to submit immediately all the 

necessary documents to support their claims, otherwise, the same shall be 

reverted to the National Treasury.  Further, she was directed to regularly monitor 

the aging of payables to avoid delay in their settlement.  

 

EXPENSES 

 

q. Various Expenses erroneously recorded to inappropriate Expenses accounts 
 

2.90 COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 prescribes the Revised Chart 
of Accounts (RCA) (Updated 2019) and provides that the Cable, Satellite, 

Telegraph and Radio Expenses account is to be used to recognize the costs of 

using cable/satellite/ telegram/radio services. This account shall be closed to the 

Revenue and Expense Summary account 

 

2.91 Review of the disbursements and records of RCMB IX showed that payments 
made totaling P6,000.00 to Mindanao Cable Television for cable subscription in 

CY 2020 were debited to the account Subscription Expenses, wherein the more 

appropriate account as defined in the abovementioned Circular is Cable, 

Satellite, Telegraph and Radio Expenses.  

 

2.92 Likewise, erroneous journal entries were noted in RCMB VIII, wherein the 
accounts used were not the prescribed Expenses accounts based on the RCA, 

resulting in erroneous classification of accounts within the same account class.

2.93 Although there was no effect on the ending balance of Inventories account, the 
misclassification will somehow affect the comparability of the particular 

expenses in the FS for the current and prior years. 

 

2.94 Using different accounts and titles other than the prescribed ones for expense 
transactions may mislead the users of the FSs, hence needs to be corrected for a 

fair presentation of the financial condition and operations of the Agency.  

 

2.95 We recommended that the Management of RCMB VIII and IX require the 
Accountant to strictly follow the accounts prescribed in the RCA (Updated 

2019) per COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 in recording 

the transactions of the Agency to their proper Expenses accounts 

classifications.  

 

2.96 Management of RCMB IX committed to comply with the recommendation and 
use the account Cable, Satellite, Telegraph and Radio Expenses to record 

payments for cable subscription. 

 

2.97 Likewise, the Accountant-Designate of RCMB-VIII was instructed to be more 
careful in recording expenses and to strictly comply with the existing COA rules 

and regulations in recording the transactions to their proper expense accounts 

classifications. 

 

r. Prior year's expenditure charged against the current year 
 

2.98 Section 119 of PD No. 1445 states that all lawful expenditures and obligations 
incurred during the year shall be taken up in the accounts of that year. 

 

2.99 Section 2, Chapter 2 of Volume I of the GAM for NGAs defines “accrual” as 
basis of accounting under which transactions are recognized when they occur 

(not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the 
transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records and recognized 

in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. 

 



59 

 

2.100 Audit of the accounts showed that transactions incurred in CY 2019 by RCMBs 
III and VIII amounting to P59,756.23 and P31,552.84, respectively, were not 

recognized in that year to which they relate, rather, they were recorded as 

Expenses in CY 2020. The occurrence of the aforementioned transactions affects 

the fair presentation of the Expenses in the FSs of the Agency. 

 

2.101 We recommended that Management of RCMBs III and VIII comply with 
the following: 

 

a. discontinue the practice of charging prior year’s expenditures to 
current year’s appropriation and that proper matching of expenses 

against appropriation should always be observed; and 

 

b. take up in the books the expenditures and obligations during the year 
they are incurred and to make the necessary adjustments on the 

affected accounts so as to reflect the correct expenses in the FSs. 

 

2.102 The Management of RCMB III commented that they will discontinue the 
practice of charging prior year’s expenditure to current year’s appropriation and 

to observe the proper matching of expenses against the respective 

appropriations.  

 

2.103 The Management of RCMB VIII also committed to ensure that obligations and 
expenditure incurred during the year will be taken up during the same year. 

 

s.  Current year transaction erroneously recorded outright to Accumulated 
Surplus/(Deficit) account 

 

2.104 Section 76 of PD No. 1445 provides that“ Any government property that is no 
longer serviceable or needed by the agency to which it belongs may be 

transferred without cost, or at an appraised value, to other agencies of the 

government upon authority of the respective heads of agencies in the national 

government, or of the governing bodies of government-owned or controlled 

corporations, other self-governing boards or commissions of the government, or 

of the local legislative bodies for local government units concerned.” 

 

2.105 Sometime in November 3, 2020, RCMB-IX donated two fully depreciated but 
serviceable computer sets with net book value of P11,571.00 to Barangay La Paz 

which was accepted and received by the Kagawad of the Barangay. Review of 

the Journal Entry made to derecognize the donated PPE showed that instead of 

debiting the account Donations, the Accountant-Designate directly debited 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account. 

 

2.106 The use of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account to derecognize PPE is 
erroneous since the donation occurred only in CY 2020.  In order to reflect the 

transaction which occurred in the current period, the more appropriate account 



60 

 

to be debited is the account Donations in accordance with Section 39, Chapter 

11 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

2.107 We recommended that Management of RCMB IX, in the future, ensure that 
the proper account is used in recording donations taking into consideration 

the period in which the transaction occurred and in accordance with the 

provisions of GAM for NGAs. 

 

2.108 Management of RCMB IX commented that they directed the Accountant- 
Designate to take extra care in the recording financial transactions taking into 

consideration the provisions of the GAM for NGAs. Further, they also 

committed to ensure that the erroneous use of accounts in recording 

transfer/donations of PPE will not happen again.  

 

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 

Labor Case Management Program 

 

Decline in Settlement Rate of Labor Disputes under Single-Entry Approach (SEnA) 

 

3. Of the Requests for Assistance (RFAs) handled under SEnA of the NCMB CO 
and its RCMBs totaling 3,402, only 2,095 or 61.58 percent were settled against a 

performance target of 70 percent. Moreover, only 59.63 percent were settled 

within the Process Cycle Time (PCT) against the performance target of 70 

percent, contrary to the provision of Section 2 of RA No. 10396. Hence, the 

purpose of SEnA for the judicious speedy settlement of labor issues or conflicts 

was not fully attained. 

 

3.1 RA No. 10396 institutionalized the SEnA Program of the Department of Labor 
and Employment (DOLE) and its attached agencies. Pursuant to the RA, the 

DOLE then issued Department Order (DO) No. 151-16, Series of 2016, known 

as the “Single Entry Approach Implementing Rules and Regulations or 

SEnAIRR.” Department Order No. 107-10, Series of 2010 was also issued for 

the purpose and provided the following: 

 

a. SEnA refers to an administrative approach to provide a speedy, impartial, 
inexpensive and accessible settlement procedure of all labor disputes or 

conflicts to prevent them from ripening into full blown disputes.  

Conciliation-mediation process shall be utilized as immediate intervention 

to effect amicable settlement among the differing parties. 

 

b. The 30-day mandatory conciliation-mediation period refers to the 30 
calendar days maximum period within which to conduct the mandatory 

conciliation-mediation proceedings, and to refer the issue to the appropriate 

agency if unsettled, except: 

 



61 

 

 Notices of strike/lockout or preventive mediation cases with the NCMB; 
 

 Applications for exemption from Wage Orders with the National Wages 
and Productivity Commission (NWPC); 

 

 Issues involving violations of: (i) Alien Employment Permit; (ii) Private 
Employment Agency Authority License; (iii) Working Child Permit and 

violations of RA No. 9231 (Anti-Child Labor Law); and (iv) Registration 

under Department Order No. 18-A, Series of 2011, among others. 

 

 Violations of POEA Rules and Regulations involving: 
 

(i) Serious offenses and offenses penalized with cancellation of license; 
and 

 

(ii) Disciplinary actions against overseas workers/seafarers which are 
considered serious offenses or which carry the penalty of delisting 

from the POEA registry at first offense, among others. 

 

3.2 The 30-day period cannot be extended except upon mutual agreement of the 
parties and there is a possibility for settlement. Such settlement shall not exceed 

15 calendar days. 

 

3.3 For CY 2020, the Agency’s performance target with regard to RFAs settlement 
and the percentage of cases settled within the PCT were both decreased from 

previous year’s target rates of 77 percent to the CY 2020 target of 70 percent. 

 

3.4 Review of the accomplishment report submitted by the Management on the 
disposition and settlement of RFAs and other documents pertaining to labor 

dispute cases for resolution under the SEnA Program disclosed the following:

Offices or referred to voluntary arbitration. 
 

3.5 Under the SEnA, the 30-day conciliation mediation is mandatory in order to 
assist the parties to arrive at a settlement agreement. From the data presented 

above, the following were noted: 
 

a. The Agency had reached a high disposition rate of 95 percent or 3,235 
disposed cases out of 3,402 handled. 

 

b. All of the RCMBs except for CO & NCR, had successfully settled RFAs 
beyond the performance target of 70 percent settlement rate. 

 

c. Majority of the RFAs handled for the year fall under the jurisdiction of 
RCMB NCR comprising of 49.21 percent of the total RFAs, however, 

RCMB NCR attained only 49.46 percent accomplishment on settlement and 

48 percent with the target on PCT.  While the CO represented only 62.91 
percent settlement rate and attained a 58.52 percent of cases settled within 

the PCT.  
 

d. Other than through settlement, of the 3,235 disposed RFAs, 85 were 
withdrawn, 262 were dropped due to lack of interest, 789 were referred to 

compulsory arbitration and 4 referred to other government offices or to 

voluntary arbitration. The table below shows the data.

e. The Agency, as a whole, was not able to achieve the performance target of 
70 percent within the 30-day PCT. This is due to cases that were not 

disposed through settlement totaling 1,140 which already comprised 33.51 

percent of all cases handled.  

 



63 

 

f. The 165 RFAs were settled beyond the 30-day PCT, contrary to the speedy 
settlement of labor issues or conflicts per DOLE Department Order No. 107. 

 

3.6 We recommended that the Management continue to focus on its good 
performance for disposition of RFAs based on its targets.   
 

3.7 We reiterated our previous year's audit recommendation for NCMB CO 
and concerned RCMBs that their respective SEnA Officers, in the aspects 

of providing assessment, evaluation, counseling and conciliation-mediation 

services to both parties, continue to monitor the status of each case handled 

and exert their best effort to address constraints toward the early settlement 

of labor disputes and eventually to achieve a high settlement rate. 

 

3.8 We also reiterated our previous year's audit recommendation for RCMB 
NCR to: 

 

a. monitor each case and encourage both parties to cooperate during 
conciliation-mediation proceedings in order to attain the early 

settlement of the case in accordance with the SEnA; and 

 

b. issue referral to the requesting party within one day whenever: (i) the 
30-day mandatory conciliation mediation period expire, unless there is 

a request for extension; (ii) the parties failed to reach an agreement 

within the 30-day PCT; (iii) failed to appear in two scheduled 

consecutive conferences despite due notices; (iv) failed to settle one or 

some issues but not all RFA with multiple issues; or (v) any of the 

parties fail to comply with their Agreement. 

 

3.9 The Management gave the following comments: 
 

Office Management Comments 
NCMB 

CO 
 The SEADOs/CON-Meds shall continue monitoring the status of 

RFAs and exert efforts to address issues/concerns of disputing parties 

within the PCT.  They are also encouraged to strengthen their 

persuasion and facilitation skills by convincing both parties to just 

settle the issue. However, since said process is voluntary in nature, the 

Board cannot simply force settlement unless mutually agreed upon by 

both sides; 

 

 The settlement of cases/RFAs within process cycle time were highly 
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The implementation of 

Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ), Modified Enhanced 

Community Quarantine and General Community Quarantine from 

March 17 to May 15, 2020, and May 16 to 31, 2020 and June 1 to 

December 31 2020, respectively, have greatly hindered the provision 

of conciliation-mediation services. With companies closed for almost 

three months, the restriction on the movement of people and the 

suspension of face-to-face conferences, settlement of cases within 



64 

 

Office Management Comments 
PCT has become a challenged/difficult task to RCMB. 

 

 The emergence of a national emergency due to COVID-19 pandemic 
has disrupted government services where the conduct of face-to-face 

conferences was limited due to imposition of quarantine measures and 

non-availability of transportation services. 

 

 In order to facilitate settlement of RFAs, the Board managed to use 
online platforms or other alternative modes of meeting with the parties 

such as telephone conference, e-mail, messenger, Viber, etc.  However, 

those parties with no internet access and cannot be easily reached 

waited until community quarantines were lowered, before conference 

were thereafter scheduled; and 

 

 The discrepancy noted in the beginning balance of RFAs for 2020 as 
against the ending balance in 2019 was due to the updates in the listed 

RFAs in the Agency’s database where actual dispositions were not 

recorded, upon validation made by Management on October 9, 2020. 

RCMB 

NCR 
The Management committed to consistently monitor RFAs handled 

towards good performance and ensure disposition according to target. 

Management also committed to direct SEADO to: a) monitor aging of 

RFAs and advise or update respective handlers to remind compliance to 

PCT; and b) coordinate regularly with Conciliator-Mediators/SEADO and 

remind status of PCTs of RFAs handled highlighting those exceeding 

PCTs. 

 

Delayed Settlement of cases under the Voluntary Arbitration (VA)Program 

 

4. Of the 1,332 total cases handled for resolution in CY 2020 under the VA program, 
a total of 866 cases or 65.02% were decided/settled and withdrawn as of December 

31, 2020, achieving the target disposition rate of 60% for the VA Program 

committed under the FY 2020 GAA. However, 365 cases or 78.33% of the 466 

pending cases at the end of the year were already beyond the 90-day PCT 

indicating the need to improve the speedy disposition of cases. 

 

4.1 VA is an alternative mode of settling labor-management disputes by which the 
parties select a competent, trained and impartial person who shall decide on the 

merits of the case and whose decision is final, executory and binding unless 

appealed with the proper court. It is the terminal step in the parties’ grievance 

machinery. It is third party settlement of a labor dispute involving the mutual 

consent by the representative of the company and the labor union involved in a 

labor dispute to submit their case to a neutral third party. 

 

4.2 Issues submitted by either party to VA would include interpretation and 
enforcement of company personnel policies, wage distortion issues, disciplinary 

actions, and dismissal cases, grant of employee’s benefits and non-compliance 

with the provisions of Collective Bargaining Agreements. 



65 

 

 

4.3 The Regional Performance Report of the Voluntary Arbitration Division (VAD) 
on the cases submitted for arbitration/resolution as well as the cases 

settled/decided or withdrawn covering the period January to December 2020 

showed that out of 1,332 total cases handled for resolution a total of 866 cases 

or 65.02 percent were decided/ settled as of December 31, 2020, while 340 or 

39.26 percent were not resolved within the 90-day PCT.  Likewise, 365 or 78.33 

percent of 466 cases pending at yearend were already beyond the PCT.  

 

4.4 Moreover, it was noted that the CY 2020 ending balance of 473 cases reflected 
in the table below differed from that of the 520 cases indicated in the previous 

year Accomplishment Report of the Board. The status of the VA cases is 

presented as follows:

4.5 The above information indicated a need to further ensure that the 90-day 
prescribed disposition period and more importantly for the Voluntary Arbitrators 

to render an award or decision within 20 calendar days from the date of 

submission of the dispute to voluntary arbitration as prescribed in the Procedural 

Guidelines in the Conduct of VA Proceeding. 

 

4.6 The reasons mentioned by VA Unit for RCMB NCR for cases disposed beyond 
the PCT are as follows:  

 

 When there is a Motion for an extension to file position paper/reply/rejoinder; 
and 

 

 The parties requesting additional conference/s to discuss the issue for possible 
settlement. 

 

4.7 The Board also indicated that since the VAs are not employees of NCMB, hence 
the Branch has no control on the schedule of hearing aside from the agreement 

of parties for additional conferences prior to its submission for decision. 



66 

 

However, NCMB had been working with Tripartite Voluntary Arbitration 

Advisory Council (TVAAC) who is currently in the process of revising the 

TVAAC Guidelines.   

 

4.8 According to the Board Technical Division, the Management had been 
reminding and communicating to the Association on Voluntary Arbitration 

(AVA) the current status of their pending cases. The NCMB Central Office (CO) 

also sent letters to the AVAs as an extended assistance to the Branch in resolving 

the observed delays in the disposition of cases.  

 

4.9 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. monitor the timeframe within which arbitration cases submitted for 
resolution are decided/disposed; 

 

b. determine and validate causes of the cases that are disposed beyond the 
90-day PCT and cases that are decided by the Arbitrator beyond the 

period agreed by the parties or beyond the 20 calendar days from 

submission of case for decision; and 

 

c. have a proper accounting and monitoring of data to avoid the 
discrepancy noted in the current beginning balance as compared to 

previous year’s ending balance. 

 

4.10 The RCMB NCR committed to comply with the audit recommendations and will 
continue to monitor VA cases to help fast-track disposition by reminding VAs of 

the same. Likewise, the Management shall continue to coordinate with the CO on 

a monthly basis for reconciliation of data. 

 

Budget Utilization 

 

5. Out of the P249,558,100.99 allotments received by the NCMB in CY 2020, 
P243,137,357.30 or 97.43 percent was obligated, leaving an unobligated balance of 

P6,420,743.69 or 2.57 percent unutilized as at yearend. The total unspent 

allotment was due to the: (a) unobligated allotments due to various constraints 

brought about by the current COVID-19 pandemic which, thus resulted in 

numerous cancellations and limitations in the full maximization of the available 

funds and b) savings generated due to the prudent and economical 

implementation of its CY 2020 programs, projects and activities. 
 

5.1 Under the National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated January 6, 2020, item 
3.4, it is provided that  with the adoption of the Cash Budgeting System (CBS) 

and consistent with Section 60, General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA, all

purpose specified, and under the same General and Special Provisions of said 



67 

 

GAA applicable thereto until December 31, 2020. The appropriations for 

Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) and Capital Outlay (CO) 

items under the FY 2020 GAA shall be valid for obligation until December 31, 

2020. After the end of validity period, all unreleased appropriations or 

unexpended or undisbursed funds shall revert to the unappropriated surplus of 

the General Fund, in accordance with Section 28, Chapter 4, Book VI of E.O. 

No. 2922 and shall not be available for expenditure except by subsequent 

legislative enactment. 

 

5.2 NBC No. 580 dated April 22, 2020, which implement the provisions of Sec. 4 
of RA 11469, directed government instrumentalities that 35% of the 

programmed appropriations under FY 2020 GAA shall no longer be made 

available for release and discontinuance of the 10% released allotments for 

MOOE and CO, following economy measures on certain MOOE items. 

 

5.3 For FY 2020, NCMB received a total allotment of P249,558,100.99, of which 
P243,137,357.30 was obligated or 97.43 percent, thereby leaving an unobligated

Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and 

Balances (SAAODB) – FAR No. 1 as at December 31, 2020. 

 

5.4 In the last three years, there is a slight yearly decrease in the utilization of   
allotments. In terms of percent rate of utilization, there is a slight decrease in the 

obligated allotments in CY 2020 or a rate of 97.43 percent compared to the 97.92

printers which were unserviceable already and awaiting disposal 

or donation. Further, Management explained, during the exit 

conference, that those supplies have been there for a long period 

of time already and it was only during the conduct of physical 

count of inventories when it was discovered.  Likewise, they 

explained also that some of the inks have been donated already to 

the Police Station where they donated the printer using the said 

inks and they submitted the RIS duly received by the Police 

Station. 

Management replied that they maximized the available funds to 

pay all its fixed expenses to prevent reversal of unutilized 

allocation because it is difficult to request funds from DBM once 

the funds are reverted.  However, they committed that they will 

adhere to the recommendation of COA. 

IX The Branch shall strictly adhere with PD No. 1445 and refrain 

from processing of payments for claims that are net yet due and 

demandable.

Office/RCMB Management Comments 

XI The Management will submit a written explanation on the absence 

of Officer Order/s or Memoranda authorizing the physical 

reporting of the RCMB XI personnel concerned during the period 

of ECQ and why it should not be disallowed in audit. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

Office/RCMB Auditor’s Rejoinder 

V The Audit Team emphasized during the exit conference that those 

overstocked supplies were the result of not complying with the 

previous stock requirement for supplies of good for three months 

only, and recently reduced to two-month stock requirement as 

provided in the GAA.  Thus, we sustain our recommendations. 

While we understand the explanation of the Management about 

avoiding reversion of unutilized allocation for the quarter, the 

Audit Team emphasized that the advance payment for the rental 

of the last month of the quarter could be made on the last week of 

the last month of the quarter, but not the present practice of the 

Agency of paying the rental one quarter advance, and the regular 

rentals must be paid on its due month. 

 

Delayed -Submission of Financial Reports/Records and other Required Documents 

7. Financial reports/statements, budget and financial accountability reports, records 
and supporting schedules and documents for CY 2020 were not submitted within 

the prescribed period, incurred significant delays, or remained not yet submitted, 

contrary to the rules and regulations provided in COA Circular No. 2009-006 

dated September 15, 2009, Section 122 of PD No. 1445 and the GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I, hence precluded the prompt audit of accounts and financial 

transactions, and the timely reporting of the audit results. 

 

7.1 Section 7.1.1.a of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 
provides that the Head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all 

government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that the 

required financial and other reports and statements are submitted by the 

concerned agency officials within the period prescribed by the Commission. 

 

7.2 Section 68 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA No. 
9184 states that: “All contracts executed in accordance with the Act and this IRR 

shall contain provision on liquidated damages which shall be payable by the 

contractor in case of breach thereof. For the procurement of Goods, 

Infrastructure Projects and Consulting Services, the amount of the liquidated 

damages shall be at least equal to one-tenth of one percent (0.001) of the cost of 

the unperformed portion for every day of delay. x xx” 

 

7.3 The Accounting Unit of NCMB-CO and RCMBs NCR, VIII and XII failed to 
comply with the submission of various financial reports and documents for CY 



77 

 

2020 on dates due set by the Commission. The same practice had been observed 

in the previous year. Significant delays in submission were noted ranging from 

one to 372 days from due dates, while the financial reports for December 2020 

was not submitted as of February 27, 2021.

and improper filling up of trip tickets for verification as required under 

Section V (1) of COA Circular No. 75-6 dated November 7, 1975 and COA 

Circular No. 77-61 dated September 26, 1977. 

 

7.6 The non-submission of contracts/POs within five days upon perfection of the 
same and non-filling up of the required data therein are contrary to the afore-

mentioned law, rules and regulations, hence, prevented the auditorial, legal and 

technical review of the same on time and the possible discovery of terms and 

conditions disadvantageous to the government. 

 

7.7 Due to non-submission of the Monthly Report on Fuel Consumption, the control 
on the proper use of the government vehicle and the reasonableness of the fuel 

consumption cannot be ascertained by the Audit Team. 

 

7.8 The continued delay in the submission of financial reports in accordance with 
the foregoing regulation, may subject the persons responsible thereof to 

administrative actions pursuant to the provisions of Section 122 of PD No. 1445, 

which states that: 

 

“Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the 

Commission may under regulations issued by it require the agency heads, 

chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, 

administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials of the 

various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, 

current plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary 

for the exercise of its functions. 

 



79 

 

Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents and 

reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of 

payment of their salaries until they shall have complied with the 

requirements of the Commission.” 

 

7.9 We recommended and Management agreed to require:   
 

a. the AO/concerned Offices to submit the required financial reports and 
documents to the Auditor within the period prescribed in COA rules 

and regulations. Remind concerned officials of the possible 

administrative actions which may be imposed for their failure to comply 

with the requirements; (NCMB – CO, RCMB IV-A, II, VIII, X, XIII) 

 

b. the Supply Officer to prepare the POs with complete data or 
information consistent with the provisions of Item B, Appendix 6 of 

GAM Volume II; (RCMBs VIII & XIII); and 

 

c. the concerned personnel to prepare the prescribed form of Driver's Trip 
Tickets and properly accomplish the said form; and the Monthly Report 

of Fuel Consumption and the Monthly Report of Official Travels to

September 26, 1977. (RCMB II) 

 

7.10 The Management commented as follows: 
 

Office/RCMB Management Comments 

CO Management commented that the late submission of the Monthly Trial 

Balances and supporting JEVs and Statement of Cash Advances for 

January and February 2020 was due to the preparation of numerous 

financial and budget reports related with the year-end closing of the 

books of accounts.  Also, delayed submissions of other financial reports 

were due to various constraints like the implementation of community 

quarantines in the NCR due to the COVID-19 pandemic, work-from-

home arrangements among government agencies which resulted to 

limited number of staff available in the Finance Unit and due to travel 

restrictions in the NCR such that the FMD-Chief and Accountant only 

reported for work in June and July 2020, respectively. Moreover, the 

FMD has limited manpower to accomplish all the numerous workloads 

such as monitoring, preparation, review and consolidation of various 

budget, accounting and other financial reports as well as those reports 

required by the Congress, DBM, COA and DOLE.  Nevertheless, the 

FMD-Head was instructed to closely monitor submission all the required 

reports and was reminded of the disciplinary action that may be instituted 

for failure to comply. 

NCR The Management committed to comply with the Audit recommendations 

and will exert best efforts to submit the monthly, quarterly and annual 

Budget and Accounting Reports and pertinent documents to give the 

Audit Team ample time to review the said reports. 

II Management committed to comply with our recommendation. 

IV-A Management commented that they will submit all received or validated 

LDDAP- ADA for the year 2020. The Branch will also correct the 



80 

 

Office/RCMB Management Comments 

numbering structure of the LDDAP-ADA for all its transactions with 

LBP as stated on the GAM for NGAs 

VIII Management admits the non-submission of BFARs to the COA, although 

it has religiously prepared said reports on a quarterly basis and submit 

them to the NCMB-CO. 

The Supply Officer designate has been instructed to indicate in the 

Purchase Order the delivery terms as well as the date it was received by 

the supplier. 

X Management commented that the Branch will ensure that information 

details such as place of delivery, date of delivery, delivery term, payment 

term and date as to when the supplier received and signed the purchased 

order shall be indicated in the PO and submit to COA five days upon 

perfection of the contract for timely review. 

XII During the exit conference, the management is amenable to the audit 

observation and committed to request the electronic generated copy of 

the bank statement from the Landbank of the Philippines to comply with 

the timely submission of reports. 

XIII Management commented that the Branch will ensure that information 

details such as place of delivery, date of delivery, delivery term, payment 

term and date as to when the supplier received and signed the purchased 

order shall be indicated in the PO and submit to COA five days upon 

perfection of the contract for timely review. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

Office/RCMB Auditor’s Rejoinder 

IV-A The complete submission of the bank-received LDDAP- ADA for 

the year 2020 will be validated and monitored by the Auditors. 

Further, the compliance with the preparation and submission of 

RADAI, SLIIAE, and LDDAP-ADA and strict compliance with 

Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I will be monitored. 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

8. NCMB had allocated and utilized at least five percent of their FY 2020 
appropriation for GAD programs and activities in compliance with Section 31 of 

the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020.  However,  deficiencies were 

noted, such as: (a) failure to fully implement all the identified GAD activities in 

the approved GAD Plan in NCMB CO and RCMB NCR;(b) under-utilization of 

GAD Budget for GAD activities in RCMB II; (c) lack of essential details and 

discrepancies as to the presentation of GAD Accomplishment Reports (AR) in 

RCMB XI; and (d) failure to use the Harmonized Gender and Development 

Guidelines (HGDG) tool resulting to non-determination of attribution cost in 

RCMBs IX and XIII, contrary to the guidelines set forth in PCW-NEDA-DBM 

Joint Circular 2012-01. Moreover, the reports on GAD fund budget allocation and 

utilized amounts submitted by the Board to PCW differs from the RCMB 

Regional reports.  

  



81 

 

8.1 Section 31 of the RA No. 11465, otherwise known as the GAA of FY 2020, 
requires all agencies of the government, among others, that: 

 

a. The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 
agencies which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. For 

this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which 

relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic 

empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, 

promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of 

gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance 

with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget shall be evaluated 

based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.  

 

b. The preparations and submission of the annual GAD Plan and annual 
GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) shall be subject to the guidelines 

issued by the agencies concerned. 

 

8.2 Section 4.4 of Joint Circular No. 2012-01 of the Philippine Commission on 
Women, National Economic Development Authority, and DBM (PCW-NEDA-

DBM) on the institutionalization of the GAD Database/Sex-disaggregated Data 

states that the agency shall develop or integrate in its existing database GAD 

information to include gender statistics and sex-disaggregated data that have 

been systematically produced or gathered as inputs or bases for planning, 

budgeting, programming, and policy formulation. 

 

8.3 Further, Section 6 of the same Circular which provides for the guidelines in 
costing and allocation of the GAD budget, states that “if an agency intends to 

attribute a portion or the whole budget of major programs during the GAD 

planning and budgeting phase, it may subject the program to gender analysis 

using the HGDG tool.” Section 6.4.4 states that “during the preparation of its 

GAD AR, the agency will again administer the HGDG test to determine the 

extent that the targeted HGDG score is attained. This score will be the basis in 

determining actual expenditure that can be attributed to the GAD budget.” 

 

8.4 Section 4(i) of Republic Act 9710 defines “Gender Mainstreaming” as the 
strategy for making women’s as well as men’s concerns and experiences an 

integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of 

policies and programs in all political, economic, and societal spheres so that 

women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated. It is the 

process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, 

including legislation, policies, or programs in all areas and at all levels.

8.6 Based on the above data, the NCMB had allocated 5.38 percent and utilized 5.44 
percent of its FY 2020 appropriation for GAD programs and activities in 

compliance with Section 31 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020. 

However, RCMBs CAR, II, VI and X had not fully utilized their respective GAD 

budget. Moreover, NCMB CO, RCMBs NCR, I, II, III, IV-A, IV-B, V, VII, VIII 

and XI reported to have utilized funds of more than five percent for GAD-related 

activities.  

 

8.7 Deficiencies, however, were noted in the implementation of GAD Activities in 
NCMB CO and various RCMBs: 

Deficiencies noted in the implementation of GAD 

Office Observations 

NCMB CO  The NCMB-CO was not able to undertake the four target GAD Activities 

with the specific objectives of in-depth understanding/ knowledge on 

GAD, to produce Gender-sensitive promotional materials and to 

strengthened capacity of NCMB Trainers to mainstream GAD in the 

Agency's programs/projects/activities thru conducting GAD Summit, 

Seminar-Workshop for Labor Information Officers on use of Gender Fair 

Language, In-house GAD learning sessions and continuous Trainer's 

Training to integrate GAD in NCMB Programs. The accomplishment of 

these activities was significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and 

declaration of community quarantine throughout the country, as per 

Management’s remarks in their report. 

 



83 

 

 

 

 

The intended GAD budget for two GAD Training programs and activities 

was not also fully utilized, leaving an unexpended GAD budget of 

P271,446.59. This is so because the budget intended for the cost of venue 

was not expended since the trainings were conducted online. 

RCMB NCR The Branch was not also able to undertake the three target GAD Activities. 

As per Management’s remarks in their report, the accomplishment of these 

activities was significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and 

declaration of community quarantine throughout the country. 

 

Moreover, the Branch conducted an activity that was not programmed/ 

included in their GPB for CY 2020. The conduct of In-house GAD learning 

sessions with the objective of improved knowledge and understanding on 

GAD was integrated in their monthly staff meetings. 

RCMB II The GAD budget was not fully utilized, considering that a total amount of 

P117,964.26 or 1.6 percent of the total appropriation of P7,408,000.00 was 

expended for GAD activities, for the reason that trainings and seminars 

were conducted at a lesser cost via online conferencing to prevent exposure 

to the SARS-CoV-2 Virus. 

RCMB IX Review of the 2020 GPB and GAD AR of NCMB RB IX disclosed that the 

GPB cost attribution performed did not use the HGDG tool to assess the 

extent of GAD responsiveness of the programs to be implemented nor was 

the tool used to determine the costs to be attributed to the GAD AR contrary 

to the guidelines set forth in Section 6.4 of PCW‐ NEDA‐ DBM Joint 
Circular 2012‐ 01. Finally, it was also found that there were some 
programs included in the GAD AR but were not initially included in the 

GPB. 

RCMB XI Evaluation of the Revised GAD AR prepared by the NCMB RB XI vis-à-

vis the Approved CY 2020 GPB of the NCMB disclosed that the GAD AR 

template used by the NCMB RB XI failed to present complete information 

while still including a column for Responsible Unit/Office which is no 

longer required under the prescribed GAD AR Template. Moreover, 

discrepancies as to the presentation of details in the Branch’s GAD AR and 

Approved GPB of the NCMB were noted, hence it created confusion on 

the evaluation of the GAD reports. 

 

Furthermore, the Approved CY 2020 NCMB GPB was only submitted by 

the NCMB RB XI to the Office of the Auditor on February 9, 2021, the 

same day it was received from the CO, while the RB’s GAD AR (unsigned) 

was e-mailed on January 8, 2021 and subsequently revised, signed and e-

mailed on February 10, 2021. 

RCMB XIII Gender Mainstreaming as a strategy was not maximized using the HGDG 

tool for each Major Final Output (MFOs)/major program/project, thus 

failing to integrate gender equality perspective into the preparation, design, 

implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies, regulatory 

measures, spending programs resulting to non-determination of attribution 

cost of major programs to GAD Budget and Accomplishment Report and 

level of GAD responsiveness cannot be evaluated. 



84 

 

8.8 Furthermore, the Summary of GAD fund budget and utilization of NCMB CO 
and Regional Branches submitted by the Board to PCW showed discrepancies 

with the reports from individual Branches as reported in the Regional 

Management Letters, as follows:

8.9 We recommended that Management require the GAD Focal Point System 
and the Implementing Department Heads to: 

 

a. ensure that GAD programs, projects and activities are implemented as 
planned to attain the GAD objectives; 

 

b. adhere with the proper utilization of the GAD Fund/Budget for each 
program in the approved GPB and to coordinate with the PCW for 

endorsement of the revised GAD program, activities and budget, as 

necessary, as basis for fair evaluation of the agency GAD 

accomplishments; 

 

c. use the prescribed GAD AR template to ascertain completeness of the 
information required and to coordinate with the CO for the earlier 

dissemination of the approved GPB; 

 

d. utilize the HGDG tool when assessing the Agency’s major programs to 
determine the cost to be attributed to the GAD AR and to identify 

which accomplishment can be attributed as GAD related projects; and 

 

e. facilitate reconciliation of GAD data with each branch to ensure 
accuracy, validity of information, reliability of reports, and to avoid 

discrepancy of data. 

 

8.10 The Management gave the following comments: 
 

Office Comments 

NCMB 

CO 

Management commented that some GAD Programs, projects and 

activities were not realized due to the implementation of the community 

quarantine in NCR because of the COVID-19 pandemic, limited 

personnel reporting for work due to AWA among government agencies, 

the need for online platforms such as video conferencing, online meetings 



85 

 

Office Comments 

and trainings which were not immediately procured and the difficulty to 

invite speakers for the said GAD trainings.  Nevertheless, the conduct of 

the Capacity Building for GAD Focal Point addressed the identified 

gender issues for the year and the Board shall continue to allocate at least 

5% of the total appropriations for GAD programs and activities and ensure 

implementation and monitoring of plan, programs and projects duly 

approved by the PCW. 

RCMB 

IX 

Management will coordinate with the NCMB CO to clarify matters on the 

GAD cost attribution to fully comply with the recommendation. 

RCMB 

XI 

The Management committed to take the following actions: 

a. To coordinate with the CO for the earlier dissemination of the approved 

GPB, although they explained that the CO has provided the branch a 

draft of GPB and working paper to be accomplished which also served

Management commented that they will have to coordinate with their CO 

about this matter since they have no separate GAD plan in the region. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 

8.11 The RCMB I Audit Team shall monitor implementation of the audit 
recommendations. However, it is to be emphasized that the immediate 

dissemination of the PCW endorsed GPB by the CO to the Regional Branches 

will ascertain the proper implementation of approved GAD programs, projects 

and activities of the Agency during the year and consequently facilitate the 

preparation of the GAD ARs by the Regional Branches as well as consolidation 

by the CO.
