A. Introduction 
 

 The National Conciliation and Mediation Board (NCMB) was created by virtue of 

Executive Order (EO) No. 126 on January 31, 1987 that reorganized the Department of Labor 

and Employment (DOLE). It is tasked to formulate policies, develop plans and programs 

and set standards and procedures relative to the promotion of conciliation and voluntary 

arbitration, facilitation of labor-management cooperation through joint mechanisms for 

information sharing, effective communication and consultation and group problem-

solving. NCMB serves as machinery that shall ensure prompt response to all labor-

management disputes that may arise and shall work towards their early and amicable 

settlement. 

 

 The NCMB is under the administrative supervision of the Secretary of Labor and 

Employment. It absorbs the conciliation, mediation, labor-management cooperation and 

voluntary arbitration functions of the Bureau of Labor Relations and its counterparts in the 

Regional Offices (ROs) of the Department in accordance with Section 29 (c) of EO No. 

126.  The Board started its operations on January 4, 1988. 

 

 The NCMB, as a staff and line office, has the following functions: 

 

1. Formulate policies, programs, standards, procedures, manuals of operations and 
guidelines pertaining to effective mediation and conciliation of all labor 

disputes; perform preventive mediation and conciliation functions; 

 

2. Coordinate and maintain linkages with other sectors or institutions, and other 
government authorities concerned with matters relative to the prevention and 

settlement of labor disputes; 

 

3. Formulate policies, plans, programs, standards, procedures, manual of 
operations and guidelines pertaining to the promotion of cooperative and non-

adversarial schemes, grievance handling, voluntary arbitration and other 

voluntary modes of dispute settlement; 

 

4. Administer the voluntary arbitration program, maintain/update a list of 
voluntary arbitrators, compile arbitration awards and decisions; provide 

counselling and preventive mediation assistance particularly in the 

administration of collective agreements; and

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of the NCMB for the year 2020. The 

audit was conducted to: (a) ascertain the level of assurance that maybe placed on 

Management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of 

transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; 

and (c) determine the extent of implementations of prior years’ audit recommendations. 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

 The Audit Team rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation 

of the NCMB’s consolidated financial statements for CY 2020. 

 

F. Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

 The following is a summary of significant observations and recommendations, 

among others, the details of which are discussed in Part II of this Report: 
 

1. Total misstatements of ₱326,774.34 were found in Inventories, Intangible 
Assets and Property, Plant and Equipment accounts of the NCMB due to 

accounting errors and omissions, thus, affecting the accuracy, existence, 

classification, and valuation assertions on the reported balances of the affected 

accounts. The impact of such errors and omissions, however, is below the 

materiality threshold set, hence, does not significantly affect the overall fair 

presentation of the financial statements as at December 31, 2020. (Observation 

No. 1) 

 

For Inventories account 

 

We recommended that the Management of the RCMB-NCR to make the 

necessary adjustments to reflect the correct balance of Office Supplies 

Inventory and related accounts as of December 31, 2020.  

 

 

 



vi 
 

For Intangible Assets account 

 

We recommended that the Management of RCMB IV-B require the 

Accountant Designate to reclassify the firewall appliance to its proper 

account- Information and Communication Technology Equipment and 

take up the corresponding depreciation expenses pursuant to COA 

Circular 2020-001 or the Revised Chart of Accounts. 

 

For Property, Plant and Equipment accounts 

 

We recommended that the Management of RCMB VIII require the          

Accountant to record the issuance to end users of the semi-expendables 

ICTE and Communications Equipment misclassified as PPE, recognizing 

the same as a reduction in the Asset accounts and in the Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit). 
 

2. Various deficiencies in accounting and property controls in the total amount of 
P12,989,769.45 were also observed which affected the reliability of the year-

end balances of Inventories, PPE, Liabilities and Expenses accounts. 

(Observation No. 2). 

 

We recommended that Management:

Accountant-Designate to support the recording of the issuance of semi-

expendable properties;

same to the Disposal Committee for their appropriate 

inspection/appraisal and recommended mode of disposal; 

 

f. cause the immediate disposal of those unserviceable property in 
accordance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445 to prevent further loss of

g. prepare the required Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) for 
the fully depreciated but still usable properties issued to current end-

users in order to establish accountability thereof; 

 

h. determine which unserviceable properties can be transferred/donated 
to another government entity then prepare the required Property 

Transfer Report;  

 

i. require the RCMBs NCR, VI & VIII Accountants and the

viii 
 

the RPCPPE and PPELCs be adjusted accordingly; 

 

n. hold accountable the RCMB NCR Property/Supply Officer for the four

PD No. 1445 and EO No. 87, s. 2019 dated August 13, 2019;  

 

t. monitor the aging schedule of payables in order to avoid the delay in 
the settlement/reversion of such payables. 

 

For Expenses account 

 

u. RCMB VIII and IX require the Accountant to strictly follow the 
accounts prescribed in the RCA (Updated 2019) per COA Circular No. 

2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 in recording the transactions of the 

Agency to their proper Expenses accounts classifications.  

 

                RCMBs III and VIII to: 

 

v. discontinue the practice of charging prior year’s expenditures to 
current year’s appropriation and that proper matching of expenses 

against appropriation should always be observed;   

 

w. take up in the books the expenditures and obligations during the year 
they are incurred and to make the necessary adjustments on the 



ix 
 

affected accounts so as to reflect the correct expenses in the FSs; and 

 

x. RCMB IX in future periods, ensure that the proper account is used in 
recording donations taking into consideration the period which the 

transaction occurred and in accordance with the provisions of GAM 

for NGAs. 

 

3. Of the Requests for Assistance (RFAs) handled under Single-Entry Approach 
(SEnA) of the NCMB CO and its RCMBs totaling 3,402, only 2,095 or 61.58 

percent were settled against a performance target of 70 percent. Moreover, only 

59.63 percent were settled within the Process Cycle Time (PCT) against the 

performance target of 70 percent, contrary to the provision of Section 2 of RA 

No. 10396. Hence, the purpose of SEnA for the judicious speedy settlement of 

labor issues or conflicts was not fully attained. (Observation No. 3) 

 

We recommended that the Management continue to focus on its good 

performance for disposition of RFAs based on its targets.   

 

We reiterated our previous year's audit recommendation for NCMB CO 

and concerned RCMBs that their respective SEnA Officers, in the aspects 

of providing assessment, evaluation, counseling and conciliation-mediation 

services to both parties, continue to monitor the status of each case handled 

and exert their best effort to address constraints toward the early 

settlement of labor disputes and eventually to achieve a high settlement 

rate. 

 

We also reiterated our previous year's audit recommendation for RCMB 

NCR to: 
 

a. monitor each case and encourage both parties to cooperate during 
conciliation-mediation proceedings in order to attain the early 

settlement of the case in accordance with the SEnA; and 
 

b. issue referral to the requesting party within one day whenever: (i) the 

30-day mandatory conciliation mediation period expire, unless there is 

a request for extension; (ii) the parties failed to reach an agreement 

within the 30-day PCT; (iii) failed to appear in two scheduled 

consecutive conferences despite due notices; (iv) failed to settle of one 

or some issues but not all RFA with multiple issues; or (v) any of the 

parties fail to comply with their Agreement. 
 

4. Of the 1,332 total cases handled for resolution in CY 2020 under the Voluntary 
Arbitration (VA) program, a total of 866 cases or 65.02% were decided/settled 

and withdrawn as of December 31, 2020, achieving the target disposition rate 

of 60% for the VA program committed under the FY 2020 GAA. However, 365 

cases or 78.33% of the 466 pending cases at the end of the year were already 



x 
 

beyond the 90-day PCT indicating the need to improve the speedy disposition 

of cases. (Observation No. 4) 

 

We recommended that the Management: 
 

a. monitor the timeframe within which arbitration cases submitted for 
resolution are decided/disposed;  

 

b. determine and validate causes of the cases that are disposed beyond the 
90-day PCT and cases that are decided by the Arbitrator beyond the 

period agreed by the parties or beyond the 20 calendar days from 

submission of case for decision; and 
 

c. have a proper accounting and monitoring of data to avoid the 
discrepancy noted in the current beginning balance as compared to 

previous year’s ending balance. 

 

The above audit observations and recommendations were discussed with Agency 

officials in an Exit Conference conducted thru Virtual Conference on May 20, 2021 and 

their comments were considered in the Report, where appropriate. 

 

G. Status of Settlement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 
 

Audit disallowances and suspensions amounting to P70,323,407.79 and 

P1,158,306.38, respectively, remained unsettled as of December 31, 2020. The details are 

shown in Part II of this Report. 

 

H. Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations 
 

Out of the 59 prior years’ audit recommendations, 53 or 89.83 percent were fully 

implemented and 6 or 10.17 percent was not implemented. The details of prior years’ 

recommendations are discussed in Part III of this Report.
