The examination on the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements was not fully undertaken due to the non-availability of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

E)	Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations



14)	The following are the significant audit observations with the corresponding recommendations:



	1)	The agency failed to submit its consolidated Trial Balances, Financial Statements (FSs) and Supporting Schedules For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 as required under Sections 5 and 60 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, thus, prevented the Auditor to express an audit opinion on the FSs of the agency.  Likewise, the objective of general-purpose financial reporting in the public sector, which is to provide information useful for decision making, was not achieved. (Paragraph No. 17)



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountant of the Bureau to strictly comply with the submission of Combined Trial Balances and Supporting Schedules, Financial Statements with Notes to FS to the Office of the Auditor in accordance with the timelines provided for by law and as provided for in the Government Accounting Manual, Volume I. 



Also, institute Administrative sanctions to the Chief, Administrative and Finance Management Division, Chief Accountant and all other concerned personnel of the Administrative and Accounting Sections, considering that this problem had already existed for quite a long time even before the pandemic, in pursuant to Section 122 (2) of PD 1445.



	2)	Of the total cash allocation of ₱5.386 billion received during the year, 99.33 percent or ₱5.350 billion was utilized/disbursed with unutilized cash of ₱0.036 billion which was reverted to the Bureau of the Treasury. Also, disbursements amounting to ₱2.075 billion for FRLEP were regular, necessary and not excessive, extravagant and unconscionable. However, the FishCORAL project reported a low cash utilization rate of only 61.05 percent or ₱181.294 over its total cash allocations of ₱296.942 million, leaving an unutilized amount  of ₱115.648 million or 38.94 percent, keeping the cash idle in the bank and/or automatically reverted during the year due to COVID-19 pandemic which hindered the implementation of the activities.(Paragraph No. 19)



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the FishCORAL National Project Director and Project Coordinator to fast track the disbursement process to prevent the lapsing of cash allocations and non-implementation of planned activities for the ultimate attainment of the project goals and objectives. Henceforth, we recommended that Management re-design the project’s program and activities that can adopt to the required protocols under the “new normal” in order that equally relevant activities can safely be undertaken and funds appropriated therefor be efficiently utilized according to its intended purpose.



	3)	The BFAR FAPs and eight RFOs have no dormant cash, unauthorized   accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds and related accounts for reversion as of year-end.  However, BFAR CO and RFOs IV-B, X and XI have dormant cash, unauthorized   accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds as of year-end, amounting to ₱28.741 million which were not reverted/deposited to the National Treasury, contrary to Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012, dated September 11, 2012, implementing Executive Order (EO) No. 431, dated May 30, 2005 and Sections 4 to 14 [only as applicable] of the General Provisions of the 2020 GAA. (Paragraph No. 20)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned officials of BFAR CO and RFOs IV-B, X and XI to revert/deposit immediately to the BTr the balance of dormant cash, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary funds, including fees, charges, assessments, and other receipts or revenues collected, trust receipts and performance bonds amounting to ₱28.741 million.



	4)	Four BFAR RFOs complied with the liquidation of cash advances granted during the year amounting to ₱15.377 million in accordance with COA Circular Nos. 97-002 and 2009-002 dated February 10, 1997 and May 18, 2009, respectively.  There were also no unliquidated cash advances in prior years in RFOs CAR, II, III, VI and XI.  However, cash advances for payroll, operating expenses, official local and foreign travels and special purpose/time-bound undertakings during the year amounting to ₱12.535 million or 21 percent of the cash advances granted during the year amounting to ₱58.596 million in BFAR CO, FAPs and four RFOs were not liquidated. Also, there were still unliquidated cash advances in prior years amounting to ₱29.347 million or 70 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱41.827 million.  Moreover, RFOs IV-B, V, VI and XII granted additional cash advances even if previous cash advances were not yet liquidated.              (Paragraph No. 21)



We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations and Management agreed to direct the Accountants concerned in BFAR CO, FAPs and RFOs IV-B, V, VI and X to:



a)	monitor and strictly enforce liquidation of outstanding cash advances within the prescribed period; 



b)	send demand letters to the officials and employees concerned and require them to fully liquidate their cash advances immediately, supported with complete documentation together with the refund of excess amount of cash advances, if any, and withhold the salaries or any amount due to them, if they fail to settle their accountabilities until their balances have been fully liquidated; 



c)	refrain from processing additional cash advances of Accountable Officers unless previous ones have been liquidated; and



d)	see to it that retiring/resigning/transferring officers and employees who have outstanding cash advances should not be cleared from money accountability and issued with an agency’s clearance unless, such cash advances granted to them are first settled or liquidated.



	5)	Fund transfers to implementing agencies (IAs), Local Government Units (LGUs), Government Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) and Non-Government Organizations/People’s Organizations (NGOs/POs) during the year for the implementation of agency’s projects amounting to ₱119.895 million or 97 percent, of the funds transferred were not liquidated, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013 and COA Circular No. 2007-001, dated December 31, 1994 and October 25, 2007, respectively. Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years’ amounting to ₱2,176.304 million or 75 percent of prior years’ balance of ₱2,288.912 million. (Paragraph No. 22)



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the:



a)	Accountants to make proper coordination with the IAs and NGOs/POs concerned and regularly monitor projects’ status by sending confirmation letters to ensure implementation thereof and require them to submit immediately the reports on the utilization of funds and return any unexpended/unutilized funds for completed projects;



b)	BFAR CO to refrain from granting additional fund transfer if the previous transfers were not yet liquidated and to enforce the provisions of the MOA strictly in accordance with the timelines that should be provided in the agreement;



c)	RFOs VI,VII, X and XII to include in the MOA specific procedures relating to the projects’ expected dates/schedules of implementation, completion and submission of liquidation and progress reports; and



d)	RFOs II, V, VI, X, XI and XII to direct the focal persons to strengthen coordination with the IAs and regularly monitor projects’ status to ensure implementation thereof.



	6)	BFAR FAPs and five RFOs have no dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers for write-off as of December 31, 2020, except for BFAR CO and RFOs CAR, IV-B, VI, and X and with dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances and fund transfers amounting to ₱126.544 million which were not requested for write-off, as required under Section 8.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.(Paragraph No. 24)



We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	instruct the Accountants concerned in BFAR CO and RFOs IV-B, VI and X to exert efforts to gather and complete the documents and information related to the dormant accounts and conduct a thorough review and evaluation of the same and if warranted, request for authority for their write-off after complying with the documentary requirements prescribed under COA Circular No. 2016-005; and  



b)	exhaust all possible efforts to retrieve the lacking documents required to support the request for write-off in RFOs VI and X.



	7)	BFAR CO, FAPs and 11 RFOs insured with the GSIS property amounting to ₱1,894.234 million and paid corresponding insurance premium of ₱19.808 million in accordance with RA No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law, as amended by PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973.  However, physical assets amounting to ₱352.825 million of five RFOs were not insured against fire or theft with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS, thus, the agency is at risk of not being indemnified in case of damage or loss of property.(Paragraph No. 25)



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Heads of BFAR Offices concerned in:



a)	CAR and RFO IV-B to ensure that sufficient amount for the insurance coverage of all insurable property were included/appropriated in the budget;



b)	RFO XI to require  the Property Officer and the Inventory Committee  to facilitate the physical count of property for eventual preparation of RPCPPE and submission of the complete report to the auditor; and



c)	all BFAR Offices concerned to ensure that all properties are insured under the Property Insurance Fund of the GSIS in compliance with R.A No. 656.



	8)	BFAR RFO XI disposed of its unserviceable property during the year in compliance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445 while RFO VIII has no unserviceable property as of year-end.   On the other hand, unserviceable property with book value of ₱96.314 million in BFAR CO and seven RFOs remained not disposed of, contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 1445, thus, exposing them to further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value. (Paragraph No. 26)



We reiterated our recommendations and Management agreed to instruct the Heads of BFAR CO and RFOs CAR, II, III, V, VI, X, XII and XIII to:

	

a)	dispose of immediately all the unserviceable property in accordance with existing laws, rules and regulations to avoid further deterioration, provide available space for incoming property and prevent reduction of the remaining recoverable value;



b)	direct the Property Officers concerned in RFOs II, III and V to prepare and submit the IIRUP for the immediate disposal of the unserviceable property and provide the Accountant with a copy as basis to drop the unserviceable property from the books; and



c)	appraise the unserviceable motor vehicles in RFO VI, after which, request from the Commission on Audit for the inspection and reappraisal of the property.



	9)	Ten BFAR RFOs allocated at least five percent of their annual appropriations for GAD programs and activities, in compliance with Section 31 of R.A. No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020. Also, BFAR FAPs allocated the amount of ₱0.443 million or five percent of overseas development assistance of ₱8.853  million for GAD programs and activities, in compliance with RA No. 7192, the Women in Development and Nation Building Act. However, BFAR-CO and RFOs IV-B and VI, did not submit the signed GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and GAD Accomplishment Report (AR), thus, the evaluation of the GAD programs/projects/activities and costs incurred could not be made.(Paragraph No. 34)



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the GAD Focal Persons of BFAR-CO, RFOs IV-B and VI to submit the signed PCW reviewed and endorsed GAD AR, detailed breakdown of the total GAD expenditures for CY 2020 as certified by the Chief Accountant, and the GAD Agenda to the audit team to enable the audit team to evaluate and examine the agency’s performance and utilization of the GAD funds in the implementation of the GAD PAPs. 



F)	Enforcement of Settlement of Accounts



15)	The total audit suspensions and disallowances found in the audit of various transactions of the Bureau, as of December 31, 2020 amounted to ₱14,965.402 million.  Settlement for audit suspensions during the year amounted to ₱7,320.039 million, leaving a balance of ₱7,629.552 million at year end, while ₱6.118 million disallowances were settled during the year, leaving a balance of ₱233.096 million as of year-end.



G)	Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations



16)	Out of the 93 prior year’s audit recommendations, 31 were implemented and 62 were not implemented as of December 31, 2020 and 31 were reiterated with modifications in this report, where applicable and appropriate.





III)	OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



A)	Financial Audit



Non-submission of Consolidated Financial Statements



17)	The agency failed to submit its consolidated Trial Balances, Financial Statements (FSs) and Supporting Schedules for the year ended December 31, 2020 as required under Sections 5 and 60 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, thus, prevented the Auditor to express an audit opinion on the FSs of the agency.  Likewise, the objective of general-purpose financial reporting in the public sector, which is to provide information useful for decision making, was not achieved. 



	1)	Section 41 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides the following:



“Xxx



(2)  To carry out the purposes of this section, the chief accountant or the official in charge of keeping the accounts of a government agency shall submit to the Commission year-end trial balances and such other supporting or subsidiary statements as may be required by the Commission not later than the fourteenth day of February.  Trial balances returned by the Commission for revision due to non-compliance with accounting rules and regulations, shall be resubmitted within three days after the date of receipt by the official concerned.



(3)  Failure on the part of any official or employee to comply with the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph shall cause the automatic suspension of the payment of his salary and other emoluments until he shall have complied there with.  The violation of these provisions for at least three times shall subject the offender to administrative disciplinary action”



	2)	Section 3, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides the Purpose of Financial Statements. It states that:



“Financial statements are a structured representation of the financial position and financial performance of an entity. The objectives of general purpose financial statements are to provide information about the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity that is useful to a wide -range of users in making and evaluating decisions about the allocation of resources. Specifically, the objectives of general purpose financial reporting in the public sector should be to provide information useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the accountability of the entity for the resources entrusted to it, xx”



	3)	Section 5, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1 further provides for the Components of Financial Statements. It states that:



“A complete set of financial statements (condensed and by fund cluster) to be submitted by an entity shall include the following: 



a. Statement of Financial Position (SFP) (Annex A); 

b. Statement of Financial Performance (SFPer) (Annex B); 

c. Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity (SCNA/E) (Annex C); 

d. Statement of Cash Flows (SCF) (Annex D); 

e. Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amount (SCBAA) (Annex E); and 

f. Notes (Annex F), comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes. (Par. 21, IPSAS 1).”



	4)	Likewise, Section 60, Chapter 19 of the same Manual sets the deadlines on submission of these financial statements. It provides that:“All NGAs shall prepare and submit the following financial statements and schedules, within the prescribed deadline.”



Particularly quoted below is the responsibility and deadline pertaining to the year-end reports: 



Entity/Office	Statement/Report	Deadline	Submit to:



Regional/	Year-end TBs, FSs,	On or before    Regional Auditor,

Branches	SSs (Combined RO	January 31	Central Office

Offices		and OUs)		of the 		Chief Accountant

						following year



Central/Head/	Year-end TBs, FSs,	February 14	COA Auditor, DBM,

Main Offices	SSs (Combined CO,	of the		COA-GAS”

		ROs and OUs)		following year 	

	5)	In line with the submission of reports, Section 122 (2) of P.D 1445 states that:



“Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of payment of their salaries until they have complied with the requirements of the Commission.”



	6)	The combined Trial Balances (TBs), financial statements (FS) of the CO and its Regional Offices and supporting schedules (SS) for the year ended December 31, 2020 were not yet submitted to the COA, which is required to be submitted on February 14, 2021 pursuant to Section 60, Chapter 19, of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.



	7)	Despite several emails to the Chief Accountant and constant verbal follow-ups thru messenger to the accounting personnel concerned requesting for the submission of the subject TBs, FSs and SSs, the reports were not submitted.  Also, during the Exit Conference on May 19, 2021, Management committed to submit the combined TBs, FSs and SSs (per Fund and All Funds) within the day, however, as of this date, no report was submitted by Management.



	8)	According to the BFAR CO Chief Accountant, there are still data/information for confirmation with the Regions due to various deficiencies noted in the regional FSs. 



	9)	The delayed/non-submission of the consolidated TBs, FSs and SSs (per Fund and All Funds) prevented the Auditor in conducting the timely verification and analysis of the accounts as reported in the FSs and the Notes. Thus, audit opinion cannot be rendered by the Auditor on the Combined FSs as of December 31, 2020.  



	10)	Likewise, the objectives of general-purpose financial reporting in the public sector, which is to provide information useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the accountability of the entity for the resources entrusted to it, were not achieved since the financial statements were not provided in a timely manner as needed in decision making. Therefore, the delayed preparation of the FSs by BFAR deprived the intended users for its use in decision making. 



	11)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountant of the Bureau to strictly comply with the submission of Combined Trial Balances and Supporting Schedules, Financial Statements with Notes to FS to the Office of the Auditor in accordance with the timelines provided for by law and as provided for in the Government Accounting Manual, Volume I. 



Also, institute administrative sanctions to the Chief, Administrative and Finance Management Division, Chief Accountant and all other concerned personnel of the Administrative and Accounting Sections, considering that this problem had already existed for quite a long time even before the pandemic, pursuant to Section122 (2) of PD 1445.



B)	Compliance with Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements 



Low fund utilization/obligation rate 



18)	Overall, the agency’s fund utilization/obligation of ₱5.685 billion is 94.27 percent compared to its appropriation/allotment of ₱6.031 billion with an unutilized allotment of ₱0.346 billion due to the imposed restrictions and limitations brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic which hampered some of the planned activities.  

	

Meanwhile, it registered a high utilization rate of 99.86 percent for Fisheries Regulatory & Law Enforcement Program (FRLEP), which was in accordance with the purpose of appropriation/allotment.  In spite of that, the FishCORAL project, a foreign assisted project (FAP) implemented by BFAR, registered a low obligation rate of only 84.13 percent.



	1)	The General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020 provides that: 



“Section 60. Cash Budgeting System. All appropriations authorized in this Act shall be available for release and disbursement for the purpose specified, and under the same general and special provisions applicable thereto until December 31, 2020.



	2)	Departments, bureaus and offices of the National Government shall spend what is programmed in their respective appropriations in the FY 2020 GAA.



	3)	For CY 2020, the BFAR received total allotment of ₱6.030 billion, of which, ₱5.685 billion or 94.27 percent were obligated leaving an unutilized allotment of ₱0.346 billion. The non-utilization of ₱0.346 billion was due to the imposed restrictions and limitations brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic which hampered some of the planned activities of BFAR.



	4)	Further, BFAR reported a utilization rate of 99.86 percent for FRLEP, which was in accordance with the purpose of appropriation/allotment.  



	5)	However, out of the total allotment of the project of ₱126.283 million, inclusive of the automatic appropriation of the grant proceeds of ₱8.979 million, fund utilization of the FishCORAL project registered a low utilization rate of only 84.13 percent or ₱106.241 million  due to the COVID-19 pandemic which hampered some of the operations of the project. 



	6)	The low utilization rate of the project of only 84.13 percent during the year with a balance of allotment amounting to ₱20.041 million is not in keeping with National Budget Circular No. 578, breakdown of allotment and obligation per office are as follows:



Office

	7)	It was informed that the planned activities were not carried out and has to be reprogrammed in FY 2021. 



	8)	Although the allotment of FAPs constitute only 2.10 percent of the total allotment of BFAR, the low utilization rate signifies that the objectives of the project were not fully attained during the year.



	9)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the FishCORAL National Project Director and Project Coordinator to fast track the utilization of the FAPs funds to fully accomplish the purposes of the project and to re-design the project’s program and activities that can adopt to the required protocols under the “new normal” in order that equally relevant activities can safely be undertaken and funds appropriated therefor be efficiently utilized according to its intended purpose.



Low cash utilization/disbursements



19)	Of the total cash allocation of ₱5.386 billion received during the year, 99.33 percent or ₱5.350 billion was utilized/disbursed with unutilized cash of ₱0.036 billion which was reverted to the Bureau of the Treasury. Also, disbursements amounting to ₱2.075 billion for FRLEP were regular, necessary and not excessive, extravagant and unconscionable. However, the FishCORAL project reported a low cash utilization rate of only 61.05 percent or ₱181.294 over its total cash allocations of ₱296.942million, leaving an unutilized amount of ₱115.648 million or 38.94 percent, keeping the cash idle in the bank and/or automatically reverted during the year due to COVID-19 pandemic which hindered the implementation of the activities.



	1)	To ensure the timely implementation of programs and projects, disbursement authorization documents are issued to make cash available within the program/activity/project (P/A/P) implementation period as reflected in the corresponding Department of Budget (DBM)–evaluated Monthly Disbursement Programs (MDPs) submitted by agencies.



	2)	Overall, the Bureau received Notice of Cash Allocations (NCA) amounting to ₱5,386.440 million for CY 2020 and reported total disbursements of ₱5,350.691 million or   99.33 percent leaving a balance of ₱35.750 million, which were automatically reverted to the BTr, inclusive of ₱2.385 million for  FishCORAL project.



	3)	Despite the overall cash utilization rate of 99.33 percent, the FishCORAL project reported a low utilization rate of only 61.06 percent or ₱181.294 million over its total cash allocation of ₱296.942 million, leaving an unutilized balance of ₱115.648 million, shown as follows:

	4)	Of the total unutilized cash balance of ₱115.648 million, ₱113.263 million representing the loan proceeds maintained under the current account were kept idle in the bank, while the unutilized Government of the Philippines (GPh) proceeds of ₱2.385 million were reverted to the BTr.



	5)	The non-implementation of planned activities due to COVID-19 pandemic affected the utilization of cash by the project.



	6)	This is a reiteration of prior year observation.



	7)	We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the FishCORAL National Project Director and Project Coordinator to fast track the disbursement process to prevent the lapsing of cash allocations and non-implementation of planned activities for the ultimate attainment of the project goals and objectives. Henceforth, we recommended that Management re-design the project’s program and activities that can adopt to the required protocols under the “new normal” in order that equally relevant activities can safely be undertaken and funds appropriated therefor be efficiently utilized according to its intended purpose.



Non-reversion of Dormant Cash, Unauthorized Accounts and Unnecessary Funds 



20)	The BFAR FAPs and eight RFOs have no dormant cash, unauthorized   accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds and related accounts for reversion as of year-end.  However, BFAR CO and RFOs IV-B, X and XI have dormant cash, unauthorized   accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds as of year-end, amounting to ₱28.741 million which were not reverted/deposited to the National Treasury, contrary to Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012, dated September 11, 2012, implementing Executive Order (EO) No. 431, dated May 30, 2005 and Sections 4 to 14 [only as applicable] of the General Provisions of the 2020 GAA.



	1)	EO No. 431 dated May 30, 2005 was issued directing the reversion of all dormant accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds to the general fund. It further emphasized a constitutional provision that once the purpose for which a special fund was created has been fulfilled or abandoned, the balance shall be transferred to the general funds of the government. Thus, the DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012 was issued to implement EO No. 431, and required the immediate closure of unauthorized accounts and the evaluation of the necessity of maintaining dormant and unnecessary accounts.



	2)	The General Provisions of RA No. 11465 otherwise known as the GAA of FY 2020 provides:

	

	Section 4. Receipts or Revenues Collected by Agencies.“As a general rule, all fees, charges, assessments and other receipts or revenues collected by departments, bureaus and offices of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy in the exercise of their mandated functions, at such rates as are now or may be approved by the appropriate approving authority shall be deposited to the National Treasury as income of the General Fund pursuant to Section 44, Chapter 5, Book VI of E.O. No. 29, s. 1987 and Section 65 of P.D. 1445.”

	Section 6. The following shall be deposited with the National Treasury and recorded as trust receipts:

	(a) Receipts collected or received by departments, bureaus, offices, instrumentalities of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs: (i) from non-tax sources, including insurance proceeds; acting as trustee, agent or administrator; (ii) as a guaranty for the fulfillment of an obligation; or (iii) from donations authorized by law or contract for specific purposes with a term not exceeding one (1) year; and

	(b) Those classified by law or regulations as trust receipts.

	Section 7.Performance Bonds and Deposits.“Performance bonds and deposits filed by private persons or entities with departments, bureau, offices, and instrumentalities of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs shall be deposited with the National Treasury and recorded as trust receipts in accordance with E.O. No. 338, s. 1996, as implemented by COA-DBM-DOF J.C. No. 1-97 dated January 2, 1997, and such other guidelines issued thereon.”

	

	3)	The BFAR RFOs CAR, II, III, V, VI, VIII, XII, XIII and FAPs have no dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds and related accounts for reversion as of year-end, in conformity with Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012 implementing EO No. 431 dated May 30, 2005.



	4)	However, the BFAR CO and RFOs IV-B, X and XI did not revert to the General Funds the dormant cash, unauthorized and unnecessary special trust fund including fees, charges, assessments, and other receipts or revenues collected, trust receipts and performance bonds during the year amounting to ₱28.741 million as of year-end, shown as follows:

	5)	The retention of the balances/receipts and collections in the depository accounts without any authority exposes the fund to risk of misuse and deprives the national government of available funds to finance other priority projects and expenditures.



	6)	This is a reiteration of prior year’s audit observation.



	7)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned officials of BFAR CO and RFOs IV-B, X and XI to revert/deposit immediately to the BTr the balance of dormant cash, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary funds, including fees, charges, assessments, and other receipts or revenues collected, trust receipts and performance bonds amounting to ₱28.741 million.



Non-liquidation of Cash Advances 



21)	Four BFAR RFOs complied with the liquidation of cash advances granted during the year amounting to ₱15.377 million, in accordance with COA Circular Nos. 97-002 and 2009-002 dated February 10, 1997 and May 18, 2009, respectively.  There were also no unliquidated cash advances in prior years in RFOs CAR, II, III, VI and XI.  However, cash advances for payroll, operating expenses, official local and foreign travels and special purpose/time-bound undertakings during the year amounting to ₱12.535 million or 21 percent of the cash advances granted during the year amounting to ₱58.596 million in BFAR CO, FAPs and four RFOs were not liquidated. Also, there were still unliquidated cash advances in prior years amounting to ₱29.347 million or 70 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱41.827 million.  Moreover, RFOs IV-B, V, VI and XII granted additional cash advances even if previous cash advances were not yet liquidated.



	1)	The grant and liquidation of cash advances are governed by the following rules and     regulations:

	4)	Of the total cash advances for payroll, operating expenses, official local and foreign travels and special purpose/time-bound undertakings granted during the year amounting to ₱58.596 million, only ₱46.061 million were liquidated, leaving an unliquidated amount of ₱12.535 million or 21 percent as of year-end, contrary to the aforementioned provisions. Also, there were still unliquidated cash advances in prior years amounting to ₱29.347 million or 70 percent of the prior years’ balance of ₱41.827 million.



	5)	This significant balance of cash advances, brought about by non-enforcement of settlement/liquidation of outstanding cash advances within the prescribed period, exposed government funds to the risk of possible loss, misuse and/or misapplication.



	6)	The following are the causes/reasons for the accumulation of unliquidated cash advances at year-end:



a)	Non-monitoring/enforcement of liquidation of cash advances within the prescribed period through sending of demand letters by the Accounting Section on due and demandable cash advances;

b)	Grant of additional cash advances to officers and employees even if the previous cash advances were not yet settled/liquidated;

c)	Non-submission of the liquidation reports by the accountable officers (AOs) within the prescribed period; and

d)	Some of the AOs are already deceased, have retired, resigned or transferred to other regions and the supporting documents could no longer be retrieved.



	7)	Liquidation of cash advances during the year of 58 percent is lower compared to last year’s liquidation of 80 percent.



	8)	We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations and Management agreed to direct the Accountants concerned in BFAR CO, FAPs and RFOs IV-B, V, VI and X to:



a)	monitor and strictly enforce liquidation of outstanding cash advances within the prescribed period; 



b)	send demand letters to the officials and employees concerned and require them to fully liquidate their cash advances immediately, supported with complete documentation together with the refund of excess amount of cash advances, if any, and withhold the salaries or any amount due to them, if they fail to settle their accountabilities until their balances have been fully liquidated; 



c)	refrain from processing additional cash advances of Accountable Officers unless previous ones have been liquidated; and



d)	see to it that retiring/resigning/transferring officers and employees who have outstanding cash advances should not be cleared from money accountability and issued with an agency’s clearance unless, such cash advances granted to them are first settled or liquidated.



Non-liquidation of Fund Transfers 



22)	Fund transfers to implementing agencies (IAs), Local Government Units (LGUs), Government Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) and Non-Government Organizations/People’s Organizations (NGOs/POs) during the year for the implementation of agency’s projects amounting to ₱119.895 million or 97 percent, of the funds transferred were not liquidated, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013 and COA Circular No. 2007-001, dated December 31, 1994 and October 25, 2007, respectively. Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years’ amounting to ₱2,176.304 million or 75 percent of prior years’ balance of ₱2,288.912 million. 



	1)	The following rules and regulations of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 31, 1994 and COA Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007 govern the transfer and liquidation of funds, among others:

	3)	Out of the ₱123.789 million fund transfers during the year, only ₱3.894 million or three percent were liquidated, leaving ₱119.895 million or 97 percent unliquidated.  Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers of ₱2,176.304 million or 75 percent of prior years’ balance of ₱2,880.912 million.



	4)	The following attributed to the accumulation and non-liquidation of above said fund transfers:



BFAR Office

Cause of Unliquidated Fund Transfers

CO, II, VII, XII

Laxity of Management in (i) granting additional fund transfers even in the non-liquidation of the previous ones; (ii) monitoring of liquidation reports; and (iii) implementation or enforcement of the provisions of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)

VI, VII, X, XII

Absence of specific procedures in the MOA relating to the projects’ expected dates/schedules of implementation, completion and submission of liquidation and progress reports

II, V, VI, VII,  X

Management’s inadequate effort to enforce liquidation of fund transfers and the ineffective monitoring of status of implementation of the projects

VI, VII, VIII, XIII

LGUs failed to maintain records to support their liquidation, change in the administration, and failure/delay in the turn-over of documents

XI, XII

Absence of proper coordination among Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Section (PMES) and respective projects’ focal persons, implementing agencies and the BFAR Accountant

FAPs 

The COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines hampered some of the operation of the project.



	5)	The effort exerted by management has remained inadequate considering the minimal percentage of liquidation. It was noted that the overall liquidation of fund transfers during the year did not improve with only 24 percent compared to last year’s liquidation of 27 percent. Management has not yet fully implemented the prior year’s recommendation to coordinate with the IAs and NGOs/POs concerned, enforce and monitor closely the timely liquidation thereof from the IAs, hence, the accumulation of unliquidated balances.



	6)	Considering the length of time since the fund transfers were granted, the funds should have been expended for the intended purposes and the corresponding liquidation reports/fund utilization should have been submitted by the Implementing Agencies. 



	7)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the:



a)	Accountants to make proper coordination with the IAs and NGOs/POs concerned and regularly monitor projects’ status by sending confirmation letters to ensure implementation thereof and require them to submit immediately the reports on the utilization of funds and return any unexpended/unutilized funds for completed projects;



b)	BFAR CO to refrain from granting additional fund transfer if the previous transfers were not yet liquidated and to enforce the provisions of the MOA strictly in accordance with the timelines that should be provided in the agreement;



c)	RFOs VI, VII, X and XII to include in the MOA specific procedures relating to the projects’ expected dates/schedules of implementation, completion and submission of liquidation and progress reports; and



d)	RFOs II, V, VI, X, XI and XII to direct the focal persons to strengthen coordination with the IAs and regularly monitor projects’ status to ensure implementation thereof.



Non-liquidation of fund transfers to PS-DBM 



23)	Seven BFAR RFOs have no unliquidated fund transfers to Procurement Service-Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) as at year-end.  However, fund transfers of BFAR CO and FAPs to PS-DBM during the year amounting to ₱3.481 million or 99.80 percent of the funds transferred for the agency’s procurement of office supplies and equipment were still undelivered as of year-end, thus, deprived the agency of the benefits of the items for its operations.  Also, there were still unliquidated/undelivered items in prior years’ amounting to ₱30.759 million or 99.98 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱30.766 million. 



	1)	COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 sets forth the rules and regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to implementing agencies.  This is to ensure that the transfer is properly taken up in the books of the Source Agency (SA) and Implementing Agency (IA) and used only for the intended purpose and that proper accounting and reporting is made of the utilization of the funds. Item 6.7 thereof, provides that it is the duty and responsibility of the IA to return to the SA any unused balance upon the completion of the project.



	2)	BFAR RFOs IV-B, V, VI, X, XI, XII and CAR has no fund transfer to PS-DBM for its common office supplies and equipment requirement during the year.  Also, there were no unliquidated fund transfers in prior years.



	3)	The fund transfers to PS-DBM, deliveries of supplies and balances of BFAR CO, FAPs, RFOs III and VIII are shown as follows:

	4)	During the year, BFAR CO transferred funds to PS-DBM amounting to ₱3.477 million for the procurement of common-use office supplies and equipment, however, there were no deliveries made by the PS-DBM.  Moreover, out of the prior years’ undelivered supplies and equipment of ₱30.759 million as of year-end, ₱30.736 million or 99.93 pertains to funds transferred by BFAR CO.  



	5)	Despite the huge amount of unliquidated fund transfers and non-delivery of goods by the PS-DBM, the BFAR CO continuously transferred funds to the said agency resulting in the ballooning and accumulation of outstanding balances.



	6)	The existence of long outstanding balances of fund transfers can be attributed to the: (i) failure of Management to coordinate with the PS-DBM for the reconciliation of the undelivered goods; (ii) closely monitor the liquidation/delivery of goods; and (iii) granting additional fund transfers even if the previous ones were still unliquidated or undelivered.



	7)	This observation is a reiteration of prior year’s audit with modification which the Management still failed to comply.



	8)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the officers concerned in:



a)	BFAR CO, FAPs and RFO VIII to intensively exert effort to coordinate with the PS-DBM for the reconciliation for the undelivered goods to be delivered, refunded or replaced with new items, and/or refund any excess balance, when necessary; and



b)	BFAR CO to stop transferring funds to PS-DBM until the unliquidated balance was completely utilized for the procurement of supplies and materials and/or replaced with new items.

	

	Dormant receivable not requested for Write-Off



24)	BFAR FAPs and five RFOs have no dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers for write-off as of December 31, 2020, while BFAR CO and RFOs CAR, IV-B, VI and X with dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances and fund transfers amounting to ₱126.544 million were not requested for write-off, as required under Section 8.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



	1)	COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 prescribes the guidelines and procedures in reconciling and cleaning the books of accounts of National Government Agencies (NGAs), Local Government Units (LGUs), and Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) of dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers for fair presentation of account in the Financial Statements (FSs). Pertinent provisions are as follows:



Section 5.4 “Dormant Receivable Accounts – accounts which balances remained inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for ten (10) years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.”

Section 5.5 “Dormant Unliquidated Cash Advances – advances granted to disbursing officers, agency officers and employees which remained non-moving for ten (10) years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.”



Section 5.6 “Dormant Unliquidated Fund Transfers- advances granted by the source entity to implementing entity for the implementation of programs/projects which remained non-moving for ten (10) years or more and where settlement could no longer be ascertained.”



Section 8.2 “The Head of the government entity shall file the request for authority to write-off dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers to the COA Audit Team Leader (ATL) and/or Supervising Auditor (SA).”



	2)	The BFAR FAPs and RFOs II, III, XI, XII and XIII have no dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers for write-off as of December 31, 2020, in accordance with Section 8.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



	3)	However, the BFAR CO, RFOs  CAR, IV-B, VI and X with  dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfer for ten years or more amounting to ₱126.544 million have not requested for write-off of these accounts, shown as follows:

	4)	The following comments by Management on the accumulation of dormant accounts are as follow:



BFAR Office

Management comments

BFAR CO

A request for write-off of dormant accounts in previous year was filed, however, it was returned due to lacking supporting documents.  The request was not refiled as Management are still locating/ preparing for the required supporting documents.

IV-B

Demand letters were sent to those employees with unsettled balances, however, no reply has been received. The Head of the Accounting Unit also averred that because she was designated as such in July 2020 only, collating of documents and other information related to the long overdue receivables and advances is yet to be made.

VI

Management submitted a letter-request dated September 22, 2020 to write-off dormant receivables and justified that all effort were made to retrieve the supporting documents of the travel claims, however, the same were returned to due to the non-submission of an Aging of Other Receivables, as required under COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. The request was only supported by a Certification that there were no documents available to support the accounts, prepared by the Accounting Staff, certified true and correct by the Officer-in-Charge of the Accounting Section and noted by the Regional Director, listing the AOs and the corresponding amounts of their accounts. 

X

The agency submitted a request for write-off for the unliquidated cash advance of a deceased employee amounting to P29,305.00, the lacking documents required by the Auditor were not yet submitted as of date.



	5)	The write-off of dormant accounts is the process of derecognizing the asset accounts and the corresponding allowance for impairment from the books of accounts and transferring the same to the Registry of Accounts Written-Off (RAWO).  This does not mean condoning/extinguishing the obligation of the accountable officer/debtor.



	6)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	instruct the Accountants concerned in BFAR CO and RFOs IV-B, VI and X to exert efforts to gather and complete the documents and information related to the dormant accounts and conduct a thorough review and evaluation of the same and if warranted, request for authority for their write-off after complying with the documentary requirements prescribed under COA Circular No. 2016-005; and  



b)	exhaust all possible efforts to retrieve the lacking documents required to support the request for write-off in RFOs VI and X.



Non-insurance of Physical Assets with GSIS  



25)	BFAR CO, FAPs and 11 RFOs insured with the GSIS property amounting to ₱1,894.234 million and paid corresponding insurance premium of ₱19.808 million in accordance with RA No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law, as amended by PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973.  However, physical assets amounting to ₱352.825 million of five RFOs were not insured against fire or theft with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS, thus, the agency is at risk of not being indemnified in case of damage or loss of property.



	1)	Section 5 of Republic Act (RA) No. 656 provides that:



“Every government, xxx, is hereby required to insure its properties, with the [Property Insurance] Fund against any insurable risk herein provided and pay the premiums thereon, xxx.”



	2)	Section 11 under the same law requires the inclusion of annual appropriation for the insurance of government properties which particularly states that:



“Each government as defined herein shall include in its annual appropriation the amount necessary to cover the premiums for the insurance of is properties during each fiscal period and remit the same immediately to the System as provided in Section ten hereof.”



	3)	Accordingly, COA Circular No. 92-390 dated November 11, 1992 requires that all Heads of national agencies, local government units and government owned or controlled corporations shall be responsible for the preparation and submission of the inventory of all insurable physical assets and shall ensure that all these insurable assets and properties are adequately covered/insured with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS.



	4)	During the year, BFAR CO, FAPs, and RFOs CAR, II, III, IV-B, V, VI, VIII, X, XI and XIII insured with the GSIS property amounting to ₱1,894.234 million and paid corresponding insurance premium of ₱19.808 million in accordance with RA No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law, as amended by PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973.

Management commented that it proposed a budget sufficient to cover all its insurable assets but what was approved and downloaded covered only the buildings and some equipment of high value.

II

82.306

None

IV-B

Not indicated

The Audit Team could not determine the amount of the insurable properties of the Agency due to unavailability of Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as of December 31, 2020 because the inventory taking is still on-going. 

The OIC-Property Management Section, who is also the Chairman of the Inventory Committee, mentioned that he was not aware then that property other than motor vehicles shall be insured with the GSIS.  As a result, the management was not able to appropriate fund for the insurance coverage of insurable property.  He also added that the difficulty in travelling and other restrictions during the period of COVID-19 pandemic hindered the Inventory Committee to complete the actual physical count of PPE in CY 2020.

VII

107.136

The property officer commented that the insurance for some of the buildings were not yet renewed in the year 2020 including those of the Regional Office 7, Carmen Brackish Fish Farm and Lake Danao Freshwater Fish Farm. Though, they are still processing the renewal of the insurance for the said buildings.

Rest assured the property officer already preparing for the documents required by the GSIS to insure the abovementioned properties

	6)	The absence of insurance coverage on all insurable physical property does not only signify non-compliance with the laws and regulation mentioned above but also exposes the agency to not being indemnified or compensated for any damage to, or loss of the property due to fire, theft, or any fortuitous events.  



	7)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Heads of BFAR Offices concerned in:



a)	CAR and RFO IV-B to ensure that sufficient amount for the insurance coverage of all insurable property were included/appropriated in the budget;



b)	RFO XI to require  the Property Officer and the Inventory Committee  to facilitate the physical count of property for eventual preparation of RPCPPE and submission of the complete report to the auditor; and



c)	all BFAR Offices concerned to ensure that all properties are insured under the Property Insurance Fund of the GSIS in compliance with R.A No. 656.



Non-disposal of Unserviceable Property



26)	BFAR RFO XI disposed of its unserviceable property during the year in compliance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445 while RFO VIII has no unserviceable property as of year-end.   On the other hand, unserviceable property with book value of ₱96.314 million in BFAR CO and seven RFOs remained not disposed of, contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 1445, thus, exposing them to further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value. 

	1)	Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides that: 



“When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the Commission, after advertising by printed notice in the Official Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of general circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the expense of publication, by notices posted for a like period in at least three public places in the locality where the property is to be sold. In the event that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned and approved by the Commission.”



	2)	Section 40.d, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that:



“All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74).”



	3)	RFO VIII has no unserviceable property as of year-end, while RFO XI disposed of its unserviceable property during the year in compliance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445.



	4)	However, there are various property amounting to ₱96.314 million found to be unserviceable at year-end but were not disposed of in BFAR CO and eight RFOs, contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 1445, shown as follows:

	5)	Management revealed that they had difficulty to conduct and complete the disposal of unserviceable properties during the year due to health risks and travel restrictions of some areas within the Regions. 



	6)	In RFOs II, III and V, the IIRUP were not prepared and submitted to the Disposal Committee for appropriate action and used as basis by the respective Accountants in recording the dropping from the books of the unserviceable property carried in the PPE accounts. 



	7)	In RFO VI, only two of the 16 unserviceable motor vehicles were disposed of during the year. In the conduct of an ocular inspection of unserviceable motor vehicles stationed at BFAR PFDA Compound, Tanza, Baybay, Iloilo City, only four or 25 percent of the unserviceable motor vehicles were disposed of thru donation to State Colleges and Universities (SUCs). The 12 units or 75 percent of the unserviceable motor vehicles which were not posted/no information in the accounting and property records remained not disposed of and were exposed to the harsh elements of nature and not protected against human abuse/manipulation resulting in their rapid deterioration and damages.



	8)	The unserviceable property have remained idle and delays in the disposal expose the same to the risk of loss thru theft and misuse, as well as to the harsh elements of nature causing its rapid deterioration, damages and loss of economic and service that will lead to lesser price/value at the time of sale, thus, depriving the government of additional revenue that could be realized from its disposal thru sale or its use by the learning institutions and other authorized parties. Likewise, the spaces occupied by these assets could have been utilized for more productive or worthwhile purposes if these were disposed as soon as possible.



	9)	We reiterated our recommendations and Management agreed to instruct the Heads of BFAR CO and RFOs CAR, II, III, V, VI, X, XII and XIII to:

	

a)		dispose of immediately all the unserviceable property in accordance with existing laws, rules and regulations to avoid further deterioration, provide available space for incoming property and prevent reduction of the remaining recoverable value;



b)	direct the Property Officers concerned in RFOs II, III and V to prepare and submit the IIRUP for the immediate disposal of the unserviceable property and provide the Accountant with a copy as basis to drop the unserviceable property from the books; and



c)	appraise the unserviceable motor vehicles in RFO VI, after which, request from the Commission on Audit for the inspection and reappraisal of the property.



Appropriateness and Propriety of Conduct of Procurement Activities During a State of Calamity



27)	BFAR CO and RFOs II, V, VI and XI procured goods and infrastructure projects, through negotiated procurement (emergency purchase) amounting to ₱218.258 million during the year and found to be in accordance with Section 53.2 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulation (IRR) of R.A. No. 9184 (Procurement Law). 



Delayed/Non- submission of government contracts 



28)	BFAR FAPs and eight RFOs submitted copy of 2,335 government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents with corresponding amount of ₱497.755 million within the prescribed period, in accordance with Items 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No.2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 and were verified to be complete, in order and not disadvantageous to the government. However, in BFAR CO and four RFOs, copy of 596 government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents with corresponding amount of ₱1,442.461 million were not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from one to 841 days as of year-end, inconsistent with Items 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of  COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009. 



	1)	The following BFAR Offices submitted copy of government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents totaling 2,335 with corresponding amount of ₱497.755 million within the prescribed period, in accordance with Items 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of  COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 and the same were verified to be complete and in order.

	3)	The delayed submission of contracts and their supporting documents has impact on the audit as it prevents the timely execution of appropriate audit activities and communication to the management of any defects or deficiencies that may be noted therefrom. As the submission is irregular, the Auditor could not comment on time whether the contractual covenants are advantageous or disadvantageous to the government. 



	4)	We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the responsible office to immediately submit the duly approved contracts and supporting documents above-mentioned, ensure that contracts are properly reviewed before notarization, and institute appropriate actions to address the causes hindering the agency’s compliance with the provisions of COA Circular No. 2009-001. 



Hiring of and payments to job orders and contract of service individuals 



29)	A total of 3,737 individuals covered with Contract of Service (COS) or Job Order (JO)  were hired on a semestral basis, in accordance with CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1 dated June 15, 2017, as updated by CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2, s 2020, dated October 20, 2020, to augment the regular plantilla employees due to lack of manpower.  Their salaries were charged against Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) in the total amount of ₱758.000 million, as authorized under DBM Circular Letter (CL) No. 2013-5 dated July 22, 2013.However, RFO IV-B hired the services of a private lawyer and paid  ₱0.886 million despite  the  absence  of a written  concurrence of the  Commission  on  Audit (COA), inconsistent with  pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 95-011 dated December 4, 1995, as amended by COA Circular No. 98-002 dated June 9, 1998 which requires the written concurrence of COA before the hiring of private lawyers.

	2)	The payments of their services were charged against MOOE of the General Fund to augment the regular plantilla employees due to lack of manpower.



	3)	In RFO IV-B, Management hired the services of a private  lawyer and paid  ₱0.886 million despite  the  absence  of a written  concurrence of the  Commission  on  Audit (COA), inconsistent with  pertinent provisions of COA Circular  No.  95-011 dated December 4, 1995, as amended by COA Circular No. 98-002 dated June 9, 1998 which requires the written concurrence of COA before the hiring of private lawyers.



	4)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the official concerned in RFO IV-B to submit to the audit team written concurrence of the COA as required in COA Circular No. 95-011 dated December 4, 1995 before the hiring of private lawyers.



Non-proper withholding and timely remittance of GSIS contributions and loans 



30)	Nine BFAR RFOs deducted properly and remitted without delay the GSIS employees’ shares and loans, however, the GSIS personal share and loans of employees in BFAR-CO and RFOs V and XII amounting to ₱16.906 million, ₱5.818 million and ₱4.266 million, respectively, were not remitted intact. Also, there were delays in the remittance of personal share and loans of employees in RFOs V and XII ranging from one to 151 days. Likewise, employer’s share in BFAR-CO incurred delay in the remittance by one to 33 days, contrary to R.A. No. 8291, the GSIS Act of 1997. 

	

	1)	R.A. No. 8291 or the Government Service Insurance Act of 1997 provides the following:



Section

Provision

11

The rate of contribution payable by the member and government agency shall be 9 percent and 12 percent, respectively, based on the actual monthly salary of the member.

13

It shall be compulsory upon the government agency to deduct from the fixed monthly compensation the personal share of the members and to promptly remit the same to GSIS.

14

Each government agency shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and government agency’s contributions within the first Ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply.



The government agency shall also deduct from the fixed monthly compensation of the employee the loan amortizations (consolidated loans, policy loan, emergency loan, housing loan, and other loans), premium payments (optional, pre-need and other non-life insurance) and other amounts due the GSIS.



The said amounts shall be remitted to the GSIS within the first Ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month when the deductions were effected, accompanied by supporting lists in the form prescribed by the GSIS. 

	

	2)	For CY 2020, BFAR-CO and 11 RFOs withheld GSIS employees’ contributions and loans amounting to ₱39.311 million and ₱33.082 million, respectively, and remitted ₱89.565 million including employer’s shares amounting to ₱17.411 million, shown as follows:

	4)	In BFAR-CO, remittance of GSIS contributions were not intact due to prior years’ unremitted balance amounting to ₱0.012 million which are still under reconciliation.  During the year, GSIS contributions were remitted on time except for the employer’s share which incurred delay by one to 33 days.

	

	5)	In RFO V, remittances were not properly deducted in the corresponding month and not remitted on time. The accounting personnel in charge with the remittances explained that these delays occurred during pandemic period when they were unable to remit the amounts withheld for the months of March to May, and was only remitted in June onwards. 



	6)	Further, the amount due to GSIS on the March and April salary differentials were remitted twice, resulting in over-remittance of ₱0.024 million.  The personnel in-charge of remittance revealed that the said thing happened because they remitted such amount to the GSIS through deduction to the loan balances of employees with salary adjustment because their Agency Remittance Advice (ARA) Form C were not yet prepared by the Human Resource Management Section (HRMS). However, they still deducted and remitted same amount of contributions due to such salary differential to the GSIS. 

	7)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Heads of BFAR CO and RFOs V and XII  to: 



a)	ensure that withheld contributions are remitted intact and on time to avoid penalties and administrative sanctions as provided in R.A. 8291; and



b)	conduct monthly analysis of the GSIS deductions and remittances to ensure that the monthly premiums withheld are equal to the amount remitted.

	

	Non-proper withholding and timely remittance of PhilHealth contributions

	

31)	Eleven BFAR RFOs properly withheld and remitted intact and without delay the Philhealth members’ contributions and government share, while in BFAR-CO, RFOs V and XII, the Philhealth personal contributions and government share amounting to ₱2.272 million and ₱2.146 million, respectively, were not remitted intact. Also, there were delays in the remittance of personal contributions and government share in BFAR-CO and RFO V ranging from one to 306 days, contrary to National Health Insurance Act of 1995 (R.A. No. 7875, as amended by R.A. No. 9241), 



	1)	Section 20 of the IRR of RA No. 7875, as amended by R.A. No. 9241 and further amended by R.A. No. 10606, provides that the member’s contribution shall be deducted and withheld automatically by the employer and the employer’s counterpart contribution shall not in any manner be charged to the employee.  These contributions shall be remitted by the employer on or before the 10th calendar day of the month following the applicable month for which the payment is due and applicable.

	

	2)	For CY 2020, BFAR-CO and 13 RFOs withheld and remitted PhilHealth contributions amounting to ₱6.929 million and ₱6.887 million, respectively, leaving a balance of ₱0.042 million. Also, the withheld and remitted government share amounted to ₱6.807 million, shown as follows:

	4)	In BFAR-CO, analysis of the amount withheld and remitted disclosed that the total amount remitted is less than the amount withheld from the salaries of the employees as PhilHealth contributions for the months of March, October and December 2020, resulting in the under-remittance of ₱0.11 million.

	

	5)	In RFO V, the agency has remaining ₱0.008 million unremitted balance to Philhealth as of December 31, 2020.  The personnel in-charge of remittance revealed that the same amount came from the unaccounted unremitted balance from previous years. Also, while the previous unremitted balance of ₱0.010 million as of December 31, 2019 appeared to be made lesser by December 31, 2020, it was only because some amounts withheld for Philhealth personal share in 2019 were remitted only in 2020.   



	6)	We recommended Management agreed to instruct the Accounting Section in BFAR-CO and RFOs V and XII to:



a)	ensure the timely remittance of the exact monthly premium contributions in accordance with the provisions of R.A. No. 7875, as amended by R.A. No. 9241 (National Health Insurance Act of 1995), to avoid imposition of penalties; and



b)	strictly monitor the remittances with the corresponding deductions to avoid over/under-remittance to PhilHealth.



Non-proper withholding and/or timely remittance of Pag-IBIG contributions and loans

32)	Ten Offices withheld and remitted intact the Pag-IBIG contributions and government share amounting to ₱18.752 million, while the Pag-IBIG contributions and government share in BFAR-CO and RFOs V and XII amounting to ₱4.401 million, ₱1.300 million and ₱1.380, respectively, were not remitted intact with delays ranging from one to 174 days.

	

	1)	Item A, Section 23 of R.A. No. 9679 or the Pag-IBIG Fund Law 2009 provides that: 



“Remittance of Contributions. - (a) It shall be the duty of every employer, private or public, to set aside and remit the contributions required under this Act in accordance with a mechanism determined by the Board of Trustees.”

	2)	Also, Item 4(E), Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) Circular No. 275 dated January 22, 2010 provides that:



“Employers shall remit the required monthly employer and employee contributions to the nearest Pag-IBIG branch or its authorized collecting banks, together with the duly accomplished Membership Contribution Remittance Form (MCRF), xxx



Failure or refusal of the employer to pay or to remit the contributions herein prescribed shall not prejudice the right of the covered member to the benefits under the Fund. Such employer shall be charged a penalty equivalent to 1/10 of 1% per day of delay of the amount due starting on the first day immediately following the due date until the date of full settlement.”



	3)	For CY 2020, BFAR-CO and 12 BFAR RFOs withheld and remitted Pag-IBIG employees’ contributions and loans amounting to ₱6.790 million and ₱10.589 million, respectively, including government share of ₱2.711 million, presented as follows:

	5)	In BFAR CO and RFOs V and XII, the Accounting personnel responsible in the remittance of employees’ contributions failed to remit the aggregate withheld amount of ₱0.110 million resulting in the under-remittance of contributions as of year-end.

	

	6)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the officials concerned in BFAR-CO, RFOs V and XII to:

	

a)		remit on time the monthly contributions/loans withheld from the employees as well as the employer’s share in accordance with the provisions of RA No. 9679 to avoid penal sanctions under HDMF Circular No. 275 thereof; and



b)		strictly monitor the remittances with the corresponding deductions to avoid under-remittance to HDMF or refund of deductions to employees.

	

Non-proper withholding and/or timely remittance of taxes 



33)	Taxes on the gross compensation income from officials and employees and government purchases and contract of services from suppliers/contractors in nine BFAR RFOs were properly withheld and remitted intact in compliance with Item A (2), Section 2.58 of BIR Regulation No. 2-98.  Meanwhile, in BFAR-CO, FAPs and three RFOs, taxes withheld during the year amounting to ₱138.612 million were not properly remitted with delays ranging from one to 365 days. Moreover, BFAR-CO and RFO CAR did not comply with the proper withholding of taxes from various local and foreign suppliers and other compensation/remuneration of BFAR officials and employees.

	

	1)	Item 1, Section 69 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 states that:



“Public officers authorized to receive and collect moneys arising from taxes, revenues, or receipts of any kind shall remit or deposit intact the full amounts so received and collected by them to the treasury of agency concerned and credited to the particular accounts to which the said moneys belong. The amount of the collections ultimately payable to other agencies of the government shall thereafter be remitted to the respective treasuries of these agencies, under regulations which the Commission and the Department (Ministry) of Finance shall prescribe.” (emphasis ours)



	2)	Item A (2), Section 2.58 of Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Regulation No. 2-98 also states that:



“The withholding tax return, whether creditable or final, shall be filed and payments should be made within ten (10) days after the end of each month except for taxes withheld for December which shall be filed on or before January 25 of the following year.” (emphasis ours)



	3)	Section 2a of BIR Revenue Regulations No. 8-2018 defined compensation income as:



“Compensation Income – in general, means all remuneration for services performed by an employee for his employer under an employer-employee relationship, unless specifically excluded by the Code. 



The name by which the remuneration for services is designated is immaterial. Thus, salaries, wages, emoluments and honoraria, allowances, commissions (e.g. transposition, representation, entertainment and the like); fees including director’s fees, if the director is, at the same time, an employee of the employer/corporation; taxable bonuses and fringe benefits, except those which are subject to the fringe benefits tax under Sec. 33 of the Code and the allowable “de minimis” benefits; taxable pensions and retirement pay; and other income of a similar nature constitute compensation income. (emphasis ours).



	4)	Section (B)10.a of the RMC No. 51-2018 dated June 8, 2018 provides that under the Tax Compliance Requirement for Other Service Providers----footnote1---- hired under COS or JO, the government agency–payor is required to withhold 3 percent representing percentage tax under Section 5.116(A)(1) of RR No. 2-98, as amended.

	

	5)	For CY 2020, the BFAR Offices withheld and remitted taxes from gross compensation income and suppliers/contractors/contract of services amounting to ₱197.685 million and ₱176.731 million, respectively. Details are presented as follow:

Although, the bureau complied with the monthly remittance within the 6th to 10th day or 11th day (if the 10th day did not fall on working day) of the month following the period covered, however, the total amount withheld for the month was not remitted intact.  This signified weak monitoring of the amount to be remitted against the taxes withheld.

	

	8)	Also, evaluation of taxes withheld for various transactions revealed that the Accounting Section failed to deduct the appropriate tax rate for the following payments to foreign suppliers shown as follows:

	9)	It was observed that the claims of SRT Marine System Solutions Limited, being a foreign supplier, was deducted by only 5 percent final withholding tax instead of 30 percent, which is contrary to the pertinent provisions of the National Internal Revenue.



	10)	As per inquiry, the failure of the agency to properly withheld taxes on payment to foreign suppliers was due to the pending application of the supplier to the BIR regarding its tax treaty relief application. Moreover, the agency is still awaiting for the confirmation to be given by the supplier as a proof that the said supplier really applied for tax treaty relief application with the International Tax Affairs Division of the BIR.



	11)	Likewise, Collecte Localisation Satellite (CLS) was not also deducted with VAT and final withholding tax as prescribed for foreign supplier amounting to ₱8.346 million. The Chief of the Disbursement Unit of the Accounting Section informed that she merely adopted/ followed what was done last year that tax was not withheld.  She further informed that the foreign supplier is covered by a treaty exempting them from income tax, however, no documents were submitted to substantiate the same.  It was noted that in the contract between BFAR and CLS, the contract cost is inclusive of VAT, hence, the agency should have withheld the corresponding VAT.



	12)	The improper withholding of taxes may result to imposition of penalties pursuant to Section 2.80 of the Revenue Regulations 2-98.



	13)	In BFAR FAPs, it was noted that there was an over-remittance of ₱0.020 million during the year of the taxes withheld in December 2019.  The abnormal balance of the account was lessened when taxes withheld in March and May 2020 was not remitted in full.  The abnormal balance was eventually erased when the taxes withheld in October and November 2020 were not remitted.  



	14)	There was also an over-remittance of ₱0.024 million of taxes withheld in January 2020 under FC 04. The said over-remittance was reduced to ₱0.012 million due to under-remittance of the taxes withheld in December 2019 and upon analysis of the remittance by the accountant, the abnormal balance was eventually settled.  



	15)	These cases of over-remittance indicate a weakness in supervisory control and unnecessarily compels the Bureau to devote resources in resolving the said issue.



	16)	In BFAR CAR, the agency complied with the proper withholding and/or timely remittance of taxes, however, the computed gross income of officers and employees does not include the benefits received such as Service Recognition Incentive, Overtime Pay, Honoraria and Loyalty Pay of ₱1.308 million resulting in the non-withholding of appropriate taxes and non-remittance of the same. 



	17)	In RFO IV-B, tax withheld from salary of an official for the period November 1-30, 2020 amounting to ₱0.030 million which remained unremitted has been delayed by 46 days. Also, prior years’ unremitted balance of ₱0.750 pertains to the taxes withheld by Regional Fisheries Training Center (RFTC) in Palawan from CYs 2008-2014. 



	18)	In RFO V, a material balance of amount withheld remained unremitted signifying delays in the remittance of taxes due to BIR for more than 365 days already.  The accounting personnel in-charge of remittance of taxes withheld revealed that a material portion of the unremitted balances, refers to the beginning balances set-up during the migration of their records to E-NGAS in 2015, during which no traceable or available documents were present to support action for its proper disposition.   



	19)	Consequently, the non-remittance of the taxes withheld from gross compensation income of officials and employees and government purchases and contract of services from suppliers/contractors may result in the imposition of penalties and/or surcharges and deprived the national government of the income due to them.



	20)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Section in:



a)	BFAR-CO, FAPs and RFOs IV-B, V, XII to conduct monthly analysis and reconciliation of the withheld amounts to monitor the accuracy of the tax liability remitted;



b)	BFAR-CO to strictly comply with the proper withholding of taxes for foreign suppliers and other compensation/remuneration of BFAR officials and employees; and 



c)	BFAR-CAR to consider all income received by the officers and employees in the computation of their taxes.



Non-allocation and/or utilization of fund for GAD programs/activities



34)	Ten BFAR RFOs allocated at least five percent of their annual appropriations for GAD programs and activities, in compliance with Section 31 of R.A. No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020. Also, BFAR FAPs allocated   the amount of ₱0.443 million or five percent of overseas development assistance of ₱8.853  million for GAD programs and activities, in compliance with RA No. 7192, the Women in Development and Nation Building Act. However, BFAR-CO and RFOs IV-B and VI, did not submit the signed GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and GAD Accomplishment Report (AR), thus, the evaluation of the GAD programs/projects/activities and costs incurred could not be made.



	1)	Section 31 of the General Provisions of R.A. No. 11465 or the GAA of FY 2020, states that:



“All agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors and mandate and implement the applicable provisions under R.A.

The preparations and submission of the annual GAD Plan and annual GAD Accomplishment Report shall be subject to the guidelines issued by the agencies concerned.”

	

	2)	Item 8 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides that: 



“All government instrumentalities shall formulate their annual GPBs within the context of their mandates. The NGA shall submit the GPBs and the corresponding GAD Accomplishment Reports (AR) to the PCW for the latter’s review and endorsement to the DBM in accordance with PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2016-05. The PCW shall then acknowledge receipt of the GPBs and review the same and inform the agency of its comments or actions on the GAD plans. The PCW shall then endorse all revised GPBs and return these to the NGAs for their submission to the DBM. Upon receipt of the PCW-endorsed GPBs, the agency shall submit the same to the DBM along with their annual GAD Accomplishment Report for the previous year in accordance with the budget call. Once the GAA has been approved and where budget and program adjustments have to be made based on final agency budgets, the agency shall submit an adjusted GPB to the PCW. The adjusted GPB shall be the basis for implementing the GPBs as well as for monitoring and reporting.”

	

	3)	Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 states that: 

	

“The Audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit Team assigned to the agency within five (5) working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the PCW or their mother or central offices as the case maybe.”

		

	4)	PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 provides under Item 7.0 that:



“FY 2020 GAD ARs submitted to PCW shall be authenticated by the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) with a barcode. Concerned agencies shall print the GMMS-authenticated GAD AR for signature of their agency head and submit signed copies to PCW and their respective COA Audit Team.”

	

	5)	BFAR RFOs CAR, II, III, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII allocated at least five percent of their total appropriations for GAD programs and activities, in compliance with Section 31 of R.A. No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020.



	6)	For CY 2020, the GAD allocation and utilization of BFAR Offices except for BFAR-CO and RFOs IV-B, and VI amounted to <a href="https://fsymbols.com/signs/peso/">₱</a>87.723 million and <a href="https://fsymbols.com/signs/peso/">₱</a>82.446 million, respectively, as presented below:

	CO, IV-B and VI

--		Failed to furnish the respective audit teams the GAD Plan and Budget (PB) and GAD Accomplishment Report (AR).

--		GAD PB was not submitted to and endorsed by the PCW.



	8)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the GAD Focal Persons of BFAR-CO, RFOs IV-B and VI to submit the signed PCW reviewed and endorsed GAD AR, detailed breakdown of the total GAD expenditures for CY 2020 as certified by the Chief Accountant, and the GAD Agenda to the audit team to enable the audit team to evaluate and examine the agency’s performance and utilization of the GAD funds in the implementation of the GAD PAPs. 



Non-allocation and/or utilization of fund for SCPD programs/activities



35)	For CY 2020, eight RFOs have formulated and implemented plans and programs related to Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability (SCPD) in compliance with Section 32 of RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020.However,BFAR RFOs IV-B, VI, X and XII did not formulate plans, programs and projects intended for the benefits of SCPDs. 



	1)	Section 32 of RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020 provides that:



“xxx.  All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.  xxx.”



	2)	Further, Batas Pambansa Bilang 344 and R.A. 7277 as amended was enacted for PWD in order to promote the rights of disabled persons and provide equal opportunities available to other citizens. It is an act requiring certain buildings, institutions, establishments and public utilities to install facilities and other devices for easy mobility of PWDs.

	4)	Also, BFAR-CO and RFOs VII and IX has formulated and implemented plans and programs related to Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability in CY 2020. The buildings/structures have ramps to provide access between vertical levels and elevators to make the upper floors accessible for the elderly and physically disabled individuals or people with mobility issues.



	5)	However, BFAR RFOs IV-B, VI, X and XII did not formulate plans, programs and projects intended for the benefits of SCPDs for CY 2020, contrary to Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020.



	6)	In RFO IV-B, the focal person of SCPD informed that the strike of COVID-19 pandemic during CY 2020 hampered their plans to conduct activities for SCPDs. As a result, the SCPDs were deprived of the benefits or projects that would address their needs and concerns.



	7)	In RFO VI, according to the Management, the agency’s mandate did not have frontline services to directly address and comply with the provisions of the GAA. However, they defended that in the implementation of the programs, projects and activities implemented during the year always included senior citizens and persons with disability as beneficiaries.



	8)	Due to the failure of the agency to formulate plans, programs and projects intended for the benefits of SCPDs for CY 2020, the needs of the senior citizens and differently-abled persons were not addressed during the year.



	9)	In RFO X, the agency does not have specific programs for the SCPDs, however, the involvement/participation of the senior citizens, differently abled persons and the youth are much encouraged in the seminar/workshop conducted geared towards the protection of fish sanctuary and mangrove rehabilitation projects.



	10)	In RFO XII, the agency failed to submit Accomplishment Report on programs and projects for the welfare of the SCPDs as required under Section 32 of R.A. No. 11465 or GAA for FY 2020.

	

	11)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the officials of RFOs IV-B, VI, X and XII to formulate plans, projects and programs to address the concerns and issues of senior citizens and persons with disability and allocate budget for such purposes pursuant to the law.



Receipt and utilization of Disaster Related Fund 



36)	BFAR CO and all RFOs did not receive and disburse Disaster Related Fund during the year. However, the projects for Bangon Marawi in RFO X amounting to <a href="https://fsymbols.com/signs/peso/">₱</a>56.803 million were not fully extended to beneficiaries due to erring suppliers/contractors and unsupportive partner LGUs, contrary to the objectives of Section 4 of Administrative Order (AO) No. 3 dated June 28, 2017.



	1)	The Marawi crisis which saw government forces and combined forces of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)-linked Maute and Abu Sayyaf groups left the city in ruins. President Rodrigo Duterte through AO No. 3 dated June 28, 2017 created the Task Force Bangon Marawi to facilitate the rehabilitation, recovery and reconstruction efforts in Marawi. The BangonMarawi is implemented by ARMM and RFO X Northern Mindanao.



	2)	Section 4 of Administrative Order (AO) No. 3 dated June 28, 2017 provides that all departments, bureaus, offices, agencies or instrumentalities of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations, are hereby directed to provide full support, assistance and cooperation to Task Force Bangon Marawi.



	3)	For CY 2020, the agency continued the implementation of the received special allotment amounting to <a href="https://fsymbols.com/signs/peso/">₱</a>56.803 million with SARO No. BMB-E-18-0016312 dated July 24, 2018 which was sourced from the Regular Agency Fund of the GAA or R.A. No. 10964. 



	4)	Though it was worthy to note the complete delivery of 20 units of Portable Smoke Burner during the year, the accomplishment rate of project implementation remains low due to erring suppliers/contractors and unsupportive partner LGUs. Verification disclosed various deficiencies in its implementation,  shown as follows:

	5)	Accordingly, the agency received and kept the items partially delivered on site by the supplier, however, no Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR) was signed nor payment was prepared until their full delivery. For the “Rehabilitation/Establishment of Ice Plant Cold Storage” Project, in a letter dated November 15, 2019, one contractor requested to terminate the contract on the grounds that the LGU was not able to provide the 3-phase line and access road to the site making it impossible to install the said project. Upon validation by the Infrastructure Unit, it was 50.366 percent completed and the condition was really obtaining, thus, approval on the request of the contractor was obtained from the Regional Director dated December 27, 2019.



	6)	In response to the observation, management explained that the change in Focal Person of the said project strained its utilization and disbursement, however, they will update the contract and revisit the Memorandum of Agreement with partner LGU to ascertain the functions of the office. Management also added that they had difficulty to communicate with the new focal persons from the partner LGUs since there was no proper turn-over of tasks.



	7)	The obtaining circumstance depicts laxity of management in asserting government rights in its transactions, thus, detrimental to the government. Also, the counterpart of the recipient LGU should be addressed accordingly in order not to hamper the timely implementation of the PPA nor deprive stakeholders/beneficiaries of the intended full benefits therefrom.



	8)	We reiterated our previous year’s recommendation and Management agreed to: (a) ensure that all suppliers comply with the terms of the PO/contract and impose sanctions, if warranted; and (b) make constant representation with its concerned LGU to comply with their counterpart to fast track the implementation of the project.



Receipt and utilization of ODA Funded Projects 



37)	BFAR CO and all RFOs did not receive Official Development Assistance (ODA) funds for CY 2020.



Audit suspensions, disallowances and charges 



38)	Notices of Suspension (NSs), Notices of Disallowance (NDs) and Notices of Charge (NCs) in BFAR-CO and seven RFOs were issued for transactions audited during the year amounting to ₱14,694.223 million due to non-compliance with various laws, rules and regulations.  Moreover, only the amount of ₱7,326.157 million was settled with corresponding Notices of Settlement of Suspension, Disallowance and Charge (NSSDCs) issued during the year, leaving unsettled suspensions, disallowances and charges amounting to ₱7,897.014 million as of the end of the year.



	1)	COA Circular No. 2009-006 or the Revised Rules of Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) dated September 15, 2009 provides, among others, that:



Section 9.1 - “The Auditor shall issue a Notice of Suspension (NS) for transactions of doubtful legality/propriety/regularity which may result in pecuniary loss of the government, and which will be disallowed in audit if not satisfactorily explained or validly justified by the parties concerned.”



Section 9.4 - “A suspension should be settled within ninety (90) calendar days from receipt of the NS; otherwise the transaction covered by it shall be disallowed/charged after the Auditor shall have satisfied himself that such action is appropriate.”



Section 10.1 - “The Auditor shall issue a Notice of Disallowance (ND) for transactions which are irregular/unnecessary/excessive and extravagant as defined in COA Circular No. 85-55A as well as other COA issuances, and those which are illegal and unconscionable.” 



Section 10.4 - “The disallowance shall be settled within six (6) months from receipt of ND by the persons liable.”



Section 11 – “The Auditor shall issue the NC as follows:



a)	If the amount assessed/appraised is less than what is due the government, the difference shall be a proper audit charge;

b)	If the amount billed is less than what is due the government, the difference shall also be a proper audit charge; and

c)	If the amount collected is less than what is due the government, the difference shall likewise constitute a proper audit charge.



Section 13 - “The Auditor shall issue the Notice of Settlement of Suspension/ Disallowance/Charge (NSSDC) whenever a suspension/disallowance or charge is settled.”



Section 22.2 – “The NFD shall be issued by the authorized COA official to the agency head to notify that a decision of the Auditor, Director, ASB or CP has become final and executory, there being no appeal or motion for reconsideration filed within the reglementary period.”



	2)	Section 7.1.1 of the same Circular also requires the head of agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, to ensure that the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within the prescribed period and the requirements of transactions suspended in audit are complied with. 



	3)	The total audit suspensions, disallowances and charges in the audit of various transactions as of December 31, 2020 based on the Notice of Suspension (NS)/Notice of Disallowance (ND)/Notice of Charge (NC)/Notice of Settlement of Suspensions and Disallowances/Charges (NSSDC) issued by COA, are tabulated as follows:

	5)	Moreover, disallowances amounting to ₱1.765 million were issued during the year, consisting of ₱0.256 million in BFAR CO which pertains to NS that matured into disallowance due to non-submission of pertinent documents on repairs and maintenance of assets, irregular payment of honoraria amounting to ₱0.708 million in RFO VII and ₱0.801 million in RFO XIII.

	8)	The said amount is due to the failure of the Management to notify the audit team of payments made thru the cashier and salary deductions amounting to ₱0.145 million and ₱0.031 million, respectively, for Fund Cluster 1 and salary deductions amounting to ₱0.013 million for Fund Cluster 7, hence, was not issued with NSSDC for the aforementioned settlements.



	9)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the officials concerned in BFAR-CO and all RFOs to:



a)		require the Accountant to monitor the settlement of all suspensions, disallowances and charges;



b)		send demand letters to all persons responsible for audit suspensions and enforce the immediate settlement thru submission of requirements provided in the Notices of Suspension, otherwise, the transaction covered by it shall be disallowed after the Auditor shall have satisfied himself that such action is appropriate; 



c)		ensure that all disbursements are properly supported with complete documents and strictly comply with the laws, rules and regulations to avoid audit suspensions and disallowances/charges; and



d)		require the officials and employees liable to fully settle/refund the audit disallowances/charges, pursuant to COA Circular No. 2009-006 and Section 82 of P.D. 1445.
