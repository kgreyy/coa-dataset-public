Dear Chairperson Alibin and President Cabañelez:



We are pleased to transmit the Annual Audit Report on the audit of Bukidnon State University, Malaybalay City for Calendar Year 2020 in compliance with Section 2, Article IX-D of the Philippines Constitution and pertinent provisions of Presidential Decree No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines.



The audit was conducted to (a) ascertain the degree of reliance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.



The attached report consists of Part I- Audited Financial Statements, Part II-Observations and Recommendations, Part III- Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations and Part IV- Appendices.



We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI) and we believed that it provided a reasonable basis for the audit results.



	The Auditor rendered a modified-qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements due to the following:

1)	Various asset and liability accounts, amounting to P65,676,017.01 and P5,663,793.47, respectively, remained dormant/non-moving/partially moving in the past 1-5 years, inconsistent with Section II and III of COA Circular 97-001, thus casting doubt on their validity, valuation and fair presentation.



2)	The reported balance of PPE accounts totalling P1,600,952,581.14 as of December 31, 2020 was unreliable due to unreconciled balance of P219,445,128.95 between the accounting records and property records contrary to Section 111 of PD 1445; Sections 38, 42 and 44 of Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGA,s Volume 1.



3)	Lands acquired thru donation with condition in the total amount of P22,933,127.00 were recorded as Income from Grants and Donations, contrary to Section 3 & 13, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1, thus overstating the income and understating the liability account in the Financial Statement as of December 31, 2020 and affects the fair presentation of the account Land in a particular period respectively.



4)	The reported balance of Inventory accounts totalling P64,488,306.32 as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to discrepancy of P32,826,380.75 between the accounting records and property records and not strictly observing the policy on the recording and monitoring of receipt items, contrary to Section 111 of PD 1445; Sections 7 & 15 of Chapter 10 and Section 13 of Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume I.

	Other significant findings with their related recommendations are discussed in detail in Part II – Observations and Recommendations of the report.

	

	We request that a status report, thru accomplishing the attached Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation (AAPSI) form, on the actions taken on the audit recommendations be submitted, pursuant to Section 89 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act FY 2020.

	

	We appreciate the invaluable support and cooperation extended by the officials and staff of the Agency to the Audit Team during the audit engagement.

1) Various asset and liability accounts, especially the inventory accounts amounting to P65,676,017.01 and P5,663,793.47, respectively, remained dormant/non-moving/partially moving in the past 1-5 years, inconsistent with Section II and III of COA Circular 97-001, thus casting doubt on their validity, valuation and fair presentation.

1) For the dormant accounts, comply with the guidelines stated in COA Circular 97-001 and make the necessary adjustments the soonest time possible;



2) For the Inventory accounts with non-existent/different Stock Numbers among various units, the PPMO who is tasked in setting up the Stock Numbers of all supplies shall coordinate with the BAC who is in-charge of consolidating the PPMPs, the end-users who shall fill up the RIS, and the Accounting Unit who records all purchases and issuances, and thereafter create a systematic procedure of requesting, purchasing and recording wherein the same Stock Number for the various items shall be uniformly used;



3) For the Accounts Payable aged at least two years, provide this office with a schedule containing the amount of each payable with an attached copy of the proof of valid claims.

















1) The reported balance of PPE accounts totalling P1,600,952,581.14 as of December 31, 2020 was unreliable due to unreconciled balance of P219,445,128.95 between the accounting records and property records contrary to Section 111 of PD 1445; Sections 38, 42 and 44 of Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGA,s Volume 1.

We recommend to management to form a task force or assign personnel from both the Accounting and PPMO who will conduct the physical inventory and reconciliation of the PPE records (amount, property number and classification of PPE account) including inventory of Library Books in the annual physical count and pass the inventory report to our office.

















1) Lands acquired thru donation with condition in the total amount of P22,933,127.00 were recorded as Income from Grants and Donations, contrary to Section 3 & 13, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1, thus overstating the income and understating the liability account in the Financial Statement as of December 31, 2020 and affects the fair presentation of the account Land in a particular period respectively.

We recommend to management to reclassify the treatment of the land covered by conditional agreement on donation from Income from Grants and Donations to Other Deferred credits and promptly record the transaction when the conditions are met.

















1) The reported balance of Inventory accounts totalling P64,488,306.32 as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to discrepancy of P32,826,380.75 between the accounting records and property records and not strictly observing the policy on the recording and monitoring of receipt items, contrary to Section 111 of PD 1445; Sections 7 & 15 of Chapter 10 and Section 13 of Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume I.

1) Recognize an expense account for distributed items;



2) Be consistent in using the suggested accounting entry for purchases from PS DBM. Establish the cost of undelivered items and record a receivable from PS DBM;



3) Require the Supply Officer to regularly forward copies of the PO, DR and IAR to the accounting office for recognizing receipt of purchased items and monitoring of undelivered purchases; and



4) Follow up from PS DBM the undelivered items or request refund.

















1) Nine out of the fifteen Accountable Officers were not able to completely prepare/present the Cash Disbursements Record and the Petty Cash Fund Record during the conduct of the Cash Examination contrary to Section 6 of COA Circular 97-002 and Section 6, Chapter II of the Revised Cash Examination Manual, thus, disbursements were not effectively monitored causing delay in the preparation of the required Cash Examination Reports.

1) We recommend that management orient Accountable Officers on the proper recording of the transactions and other matters related to his/her work; and record daily all transactions in their respective Cash Disbursements Record/PCF Record.

















	2) Three Accountable Officers of External Studies Centers performing Collection functions were found to be not bonded or has expired fidelity bond, contrary to Section 101 of PD 1445 and Section 7.1 of COA Circular 97-002, thus posing a risk that the government agency concerned will not be adequately indemnified in the event of embezzlement or other kind of losses of the AOs cash and accounts.

	1) We recommend that management appoint personnel who are regular to the Agency and if not feasible, establish a procedure of collecting payments through bank transfer and other online mechanisms to the credit of BukSU Main; and see to it that all Accountable Officers are duly bonded during the period of their incumbency.

















	3) Advance dating in the issuance of certain Continuous Accountable Forms of ESC Iligan were noted contrary to the Government Accounting Manual and PD 1445 – ‘Government Auditing Code of the Philippines’, this, casting doubt on the reliability of the Collection Procedures and Systems of the said office.

	1) We recommend that management review and improve the existing collection system of ESC – Iligan and have it checked for procedural and system lapses and such review and improvement be applied to all other Satellite Campuses who are using the Continuous Form for Collections.

















1) Inconsistencies in the timelines of the Contract of Goods, Purchase Orders and Notices to Proceed have been observed contrary to RA 9184 – ‘2016 Revised IRR’ and the Government Procurement Manual Volume 2, thus causing delay in the implementation of the related contracts.

1) When possible, the signing of the Contract Agreement and the Purchase Order shall be made on the same day in order to have a uniform date from where the counting of the seven (7) day period for the issuance of the NTP shall commence; and



	2) Henceforth, adhere to the required timelines as required by the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184.

















1) Delayed implementation of specific project/s and in the endorsement of facilities to end –users have been noted inconsistent with the principles stated in the Government Procurement Manual and other related standards, resulting to delayed completion and/or endorsement thereby depriving the end-user and/or the general public of the benefits that could have been derived thereon.

We recommend that management continually review the duties and responsibilities of each unit involved in the Procurement Process to avoid oversights in the preparation of procurement documents and ensure proper coordination between the implementing unit/s and end-user/s such that all the specifications needed for the suitable and timely utilization of the end-user of constructed/requested facilities are incorporated in the Plans/Technical Specifications.

















2) On-going  Infrastructure Projects were observed to have no signboard displayed at the project location contrary to COA Circular 2013-004 – ‘Information and Publicity on Programs/Projects/Activities of Government Agencies’, thus dispensing the principles of good governance through transparency and accountability.

We recommend that management require immediately all contractors to provide the tarpaulin signboards on all on-going projects and to conduct proper orientation or dissemination as required under COA Circular 2013-004.

















1) The capitalization threshold in classifying the purchased item as PPE was not observed, and some items purchased in the prior years with cost below the P15,000.00 remains in various PPE accounts, contrary to Section 10 & 11 of Chapter 8; Sections 3 & 4, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume 1, thus overstating the PPE account and understating the Expense and the Accumulated Surplus accounts in the Financial Statements.

We recommended that management reclassify the items that did not met the capitalization threshold to expense account (if issued within the year), or accumulated surplus/(deficit (if issued in prior years) and issue Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) to establish accountability over the semi-expendable property. 



















2) Some items in the PPE were not provided with depreciation and/or with negative balances and properties were recorded in lump amount affects the accuracy of the valuation of the affected properties  in the Financial Statement  contrary to Section 111 of PD 1445 and Sections 8, 22 & 27 of Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1.



	We recommended management to instruct the accounting office to assign its personnel who will review and analyze the schedule of PPE and adjust the errors detected (items purchased in lump sum and recorded as one item, unrecorded and errors in the depreciation and accumulated depreciation respectively). Henceforth, observe the proper recording of acquired PPEs and its depreciation.

















1) Non-submission of request for relieve from accountability and other supporting documents prevented management and the audit team to conduct the necessary investigation and assess the circumstances  in the lost items, failure to set up a receivable from the accountability of the accountable officer and simultaneous derecognition of the PPE affects the accuracy and fairness of presentation of the affected accounts in the Financial Statements contrary to Section 41, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume 1.

1) Adhere to the requirement on submission of the request for relief from accountability with the required documents within the prescribed period in case of loss of properties;



2) Set up the receivable to recognize the accountability of the concerned accountable officer;



3) Derecognize the lost PPE;

We are recommending to management to hasten the submission of the documents required by the banks to facilitate the efficient withdrawal of the remaining amount back to the coffers of the University.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



A)	Introduction 



The Bukidnon State University situated in Malaybalay City is strategically located to serve Region X and other outlying cities and provinces in Mindanao. It has been in existence for 92 years. It started from being a Bukidnon Provincial High School in 1924 and expanded to become Bukidnon Normal School in 1928. It then commenced offering education courses to produce elementary school teachers when a training department was opened. The school had to close during World War II on December 9, 1941 while it was making a slight headway towards acquiring a collegiate status. In 1972, the Bukidnon Normal School was renamed Bukidnon Normal College. With the Issuance of P.D. 944, Bukidnon Normal College was converted into Bukidnon State College on June 14, 1976.



The University was upgraded and renamed several times until finally in June 10, 2007, by virtue of R.A. 9456 it was converted into Bukidnon State University (BSU). Rigorous improvements were aligned to address the global perspective of the University. Continuing infrastructure build-up, linkages with external and internal groups were strengthened and programs on Information Technology and Instructional Systems Design were introduced. BukSU’s mandate is to provide advanced education, higher technological, professional instruction and training in the fields of education, arts and sciences, public administration, information technology, accountancy, law and other relevant fields of study. It shall also promote research and extension service, and provide progressive leadership in its areas of specialization.



BukSU is committed to its vision to be a premier institution of higher learning in teacher education, sciences and humanities. It has its mission of developing competitive professionals who are committed to build a sustainable life for all through quality instruction, research, extension and production.  Its accomplishments represent the continuing achievements of the university through the coordinated efforts of its stakeholders.



Aside from BSU main campus, the university also operates twelve (4) External Studies Centers (ESCs) and eleven (12) Satellite Campuses. In 2018, there was a reduction of the ESCs from eighteen (12) to twelve (4) due to the closure of several ESCs and conversion of the Bukidnon ESCs to Satellite Campuses. Moreover, additional Satellite Campuses were opened during the year. The ESCs and SCs are located in the following regions and provinces.

The audit covered the financial transactions of BSU for calendar year 2020. The audit was primarily aimed at ascertaining the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s assertion on the financial statements; recommend agency improvement opportunities; and determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations. It consisted of review of operating procedures, evaluation of BSUs programs and projects, interview of concerned government officials and employees, verification, reconciliation, and analysis of accounts, and such other procedures considered necessary. On a test basis, it also included a review of the propriety of disbursements and other financial transactions to determine whether or not the transactions were made in accordance with existing laws, rules and regulations.



E)	Independent Auditor’s Report on the  Financial Statements



The auditor rendered a modified-qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements of BSU for calendar year ended December 31, 2020 in view of the following:

1)	Various asset and liability accounts amounting to P65,676,017.01 and P5,663,793.47, respectively, remained dormant/non-moving/partially moving in the past 1-5 years, inconsistent with Section II and III of COA Circular 97-001, thus casting doubt on their validity, valuation and fair presentation.



2)	The reported balance of PPE accounts totalling P1,600,952,581.14 as of December 31, 2020 was unreliable due to unreconciled balance of P219,445,128.95 between the accounting records and property records contrary to Section 111 of PD 1445; Sections 38, 42 and 44 of Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGA,s Volume 1.



3)	Lands acquired thru donation with condition in the total amount of P22,933,127.00 were recorded as Income from Grants and Donations, contrary to Section 3 & 13, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1, thus overstating the income and understating the liability account in the Financial Statement as of December 31, 2020 and affects the fair presentation of the account Land in a particular period respectively.



4)	The reported balance of Inventory accounts totalling P64,488,306.32 as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to discrepancy of P32,826,380.75 between the accounting records and property records and not strictly observing the policy on the recording and monitoring of receipt items, contrary to Section 111 of PD 1445; Sections 7 & 15 of Chapter 10 and Section 13 of Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume I.

F.         Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 

	

In addition, the following is a summary of significant observations and recommendations which need immediate action:

1)	Nine out of the fifteen Accountable Officers were not able to completely prepare/present the Cash Disbursements Record and the Petty Cash Fund Record during the conduct of the Cash Examination contrary to Section 6 of COA Circular 97-002 and Section 6, Chapter II of the Revised Cash Examination Manual, thus, disbursements were not effectively monitored causing delay in the preparation of the required Cash Examination Reports.



We recommended that management orient Accountable Officers on the proper recording of the transactions and other matters related to his/her work; and record daily all transactions in their respective Cash Disbursements Record/PCF Record.



2)	Three Accountable Officers of External Studies Centers performing Collection functions were found to be not bonded or has expired fidelity bond, contrary to Section 101 of PD 1445 and Section 7.1 of COA Circular 97-002, thus posing a risk that the government agency concerned will not be adequately indemnified in the event of embezzlement or other kind of losses of the AOs cash and accounts.

We recommended that management appoint personnel who are regular to the Agency and if not feasible, establish a procedure of collecting payments through bank transfer and other online mechanisms to the credit of BukSU Main; and see to it that all Accountable Officers are duly bonded during the period of their incumbency.

3)	Advance dating in the issuance of certain Continuous Accountable Forms of ESC Iligan were noted contrary to the Government Accounting Manual and PD 1445 – ‘Government Auditing Code of the Philippines’, this, casting doubt on the reliability of the Collection Procedures and Systems of the said office.

We recommended that management review and improve the existing collection system of ESC – Iligan and have it checked for procedural and system lapses and such review and improvement be applied to all other Satellite Campuses who are using the Continuous Form for Collections.

4)	Inconsistencies in the timelines of the Contract of Goods, Purchase Orders and Notices to Proceed have been observed contrary to RA 9184 – ‘2016 Revised IRR’ and the Government Procurement Manual Volume 2, thus causing delay in the implementation of the related contracts.

We recommended that management require the signing of the Contract Agreement and the Purchase Order to be made on the same day in order to have a uniform date from where the counting of the seven (7) day period for the issuance of the NTP shall commence for the benefit of the government.

5.   Delayed implementation of specific project/s and in the endorsement of facilities to end –users have been noted inconsistent with the principles stated in the Government Procurement Manual and other related standards, resulting to delayed completion and/or endorsement thereby depriving the end-user and/or the general public of the benefits that could have been derived thereon.

	We recommended that management continually review the duties and responsibilities of each unit involved in the Procurement Process to avoid oversights in the preparation of procurement documents and ensure proper coordination between the implementing unit/s and end-user/s such that all the specifications needed for the suitable and timely utilization of the end-user of constructed/requested facilities are incorporated in the Plans/Technical Specifications.

	6.  On-going  Infrastructure Projects were observed to have no signboard displayed at the project location contrary to COA Circular 2013-004 – ‘Information and Publicity on Programs/Projects/Activities of Government Agencies’, thus dispensing the principles of good governance through transparency and accountability.

	

		We recommended that management immediately require all contractors to provide the tarpaulin signboards on all on-going projects and to conduct proper orientation or dissemination as required under COA Circular 2013-004.

	

	7. The capitalization threshold in classifying the purchased item as PPE was not observed,  

	and some items purchased in the prior years with cost below the P15,000.00 remains in various PPE accounts, contrary to Section 10 & 11 of Chapter 8; Sections 3 & 4, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume 1, thus overstating the PPE account and understating the Expense and the Accumulated Surplus accounts in the Financial Statements.

	

	We recommended that management instruct the accounting office to assign its personnel who will review and analyze the schedule of PPE and adjust the errors detected (items purchased in lump sum and recorded as one item, unrecorded and errors in the depreciation and accumulated depreciation respectively). Henceforth, observe the proper recording of acquired PPEs and its depreciation.

	

		8. Non-submission of request for relieve from accountability and other supporting documents prevented management and the audit team to conduct the necessary investigation and assess the circumstances  in the lost items, failure to set up a receivable from the accountability of the accountable officer and simultaneous derecognition of the PPE affects the accuracy and fairness of presentation of the affected accounts in the Financial Statements contrary to Section 41, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume 1.

		

	We recommended that management adhere to the requirement on submission of the request for relief from accountability with the required documents within the prescribed period in case of loss of properties; set up the receivable to recognize the accountability of the concerned accountable officer; derecognize the lost PPE; and require the concerned accountable officer to submit a request for relief from accountability with the required documents.

	

	9. Bank accounts of then External Centers with an aggregate amount of P248,563.08 remained in the respective depository banks despite its closure (external centers), thus depriving the University on a more productive use of the money contrary to the declared policy of the government on sound fiscal management of government resources.

	

		We recommended that management hasten the submission of the documents required by the banks to facilitate the efficient withdrawal of the remaining amount back to the coffers of the University.

	

	

	10. Disbursements for COVID-19 Hazard Pay in December 2020 in the amount P2M were not supported with sufficient and relevant documents contrary to the guidelines set forth in AO 26 – ‘Authorizing the Grant of Hazard Pay to Government Personnel xxx Implementation of an Enhanced Community Quarantine relative to the Covid-19 Outbreak’ and DBM Budget Circular 2020-1 – ‘Guidelines on the Grant of the Covid-19 Hazard Pay’, thus the validity of the transaction could not be ascertained.

	

		We recommended that management:

	

a)	Prepare and submit to this office a summary of the Hazard Pay disbursed by fund, containing the total amount paid for the period March 17-25, 2020 and April 16-30, 2020;



b)	Submit additional supporting documents showing that the LGUs where each Satellite Campus is located declared an Enhanced Community Quarantine showing the inclusive dates thereof; and



c)	Henceforth, management is encouraged to be more cautious in reviewing all supporting documents and related issuances of disbursements especially those which are not commonly paid out.

	

A)	Status of Settlement of Accounts



As of December 31, 2020 the Statement of Audit Suspension, Disallowances and Charges reflected a total of balance of P1,182,887.01 and P8,094,898.77 for suspensions and disallowance respectively.

Modified-Qualified Opinion



We have audited the financial statement of Bukidnon State University, Malaybalay City, Bukidnon which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020 and the Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Charges in Net Assets/Equity, Cash Flow Statement and Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts for the year then ended, and Notes to Financial Statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.



				In our opinion, except for the possible effects of the matter described in the Basis for Modified-Qualified Opinion section of our report, the accompanying financial statement present fairly, in all material respects the financial position of the Bukidnon State University, Malaybalay City, Bukidnon as of December 31, 2020, and its financial performance and its cash flows, and its comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended  in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS).



Basis for Modified-Qualified Opinion



As discussed in Part II of this report, the following are the significant deficiencies:

1)	Various asset and liability accounts amounting to P65,676,017.01 and P5,663,793.47, respectively, remained dormant/non-moving/partially moving in the past 1-5 years, inconsistent with Section II and III of COA Circular 97-001, thus casting doubt on their validity, valuation and fair presentation.



2)	The reported balance of PPE accounts totalling P1,600,952,581.14 as of December 31, 2020 was unreliable due to unreconciled balance of P219,445,128.95 between the accounting records and property records contrary to Section 111 of PD 1445; Sections 38, 42 and 44 of Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGA,s Volume 1.



3)	Lands acquired thru donation with condition in the total amount of P22,933,127.00 were recorded as Income from Grants and Donations, contrary to Section 3 & 13, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1, thus overstating the income and understating the liability account in the Financial Statement as of December 31, 2020 and affects the fair presentation of the account Land in a particular period respectively.



4)	The reported balance of Inventory accounts totalling P64,488,306.32 as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to discrepancy of P32,826,380.75 between the accounting records and property records and not strictly observing the policy on the recording and monitoring of receipt items, contrary to Section 111 of PD 1445; Sections 7 & 15 of Chapter 10 and Section 13 of Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume I.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the International Standard for Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the agency in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements, and we have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our modified-qualified opinion.



Key Audit Matters

Except for the matter described in the Basis for Modified-Qualified Opinion section, we have determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report.



Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with IPSASs, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.



Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the agency’s financial reporting process.



Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements



Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

BUKIDNON STATE UNIVERSITY

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended December 31, 2020



1.	General Information/Agency Profile

The consolidated financial statements of Bukidnon State University were authorized for issue on February 11, 2021 as shown in the Management Representation Letter for Financial Statements signed by Dr. Oscar B. Cabañelez, the Head of Agency.

Bukidnon State College (BSC) attained its University status after Pres. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed into law Republic Act No. 9456 on May 15, 2007, converting BSC into a state university to be known as the Bukidnon State University (BukSU). Passed during the Third Special Session of the Thirteenth Congress of the Philippines, RA 9456 was approved by the Senate last February 19, 2007 and was signed into law by the President 85 days after. 

As a state university, BukSU shall primarily provide advanced education, higher technological, professional instruction and training in the fields of education, arts and sciences, public administration, information technology, accountancy, law and other relevant fields of study. It shall also promote research and extension service, and provide progressive leadership in its areas of specialization.



Teacher education continues to be its flagship program-offering baccalaureate courses towards the degree Bachelor of Elementary Education and Bachelor of Secondary Education. In addition to other existing BS non-education degrees, new program offerings were recently introduced.



To carry on its significant role in building a strong Republic, the university’s vision, “A premier institution of innovative and ethical leaders for sustainable development”, continues to be its guiding light.



2.	Statement of Compliance and Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements

		

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and comply with the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) issued by the Commission on Audit per COA Resolution No. 2014-003 dated January 24, 2014. 

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, unless stated otherwise. The Statement of Cash Flows is prepared using the direct method.



3.	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



	1)	Basis of accounting



The consolidated financial statements are prepared on accrual basis in PPSAS 1.6 in accordance with the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standard (PPSAS).



	2)	Cash and Cash Equivalents



Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash at bank, deposits on call and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.



	3)	Inventories



Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition. To the extent that inventory was received through non-exchange transactions (for no cost or for a nominal cost), the cost of the inventory is its fair value at the date of acquisition. 



Inventories are recognized as an expense when deployed for utilization or consumption in the ordinary course of operations of the Bukidnon State University.



	4)	Property, Plant and Equipment



Recognition



An item is recognized as property, plant, and equipment (PPE) if it meets the characteristics and recognition criteria as a PPE. The characteristics of PPE are as follows:

--	tangible items;

--	are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes; and

--	are expected to be used during more than one reporting period.



An item of PPE is recognized as an asset if:

--	It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to the entity; and

--	The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably.



Measurement at Recognition



An item recognized as property, plant, and equipment is measured at cost. A PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction is measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition. The cost of the PPE is the cash price equivalent or, for PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction its cost is its fair value as at recognition date. Cost includes the following:



--	Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates;

--	expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items; and

--	initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired, or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that period.



Measurement After Recognition



After recognition, all property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.



When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Bukidnon State University recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major repair/replacement is done, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.



All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense in surplus or deficit as incurred.



Depreciation



Each part of an item of property, plant, and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately.



The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expense unless it is included in the cost of another asset.



Initial Recognition of Depreciation



Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation is for one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month. However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, depreciation is for the succeeding month.



Depreciation Method



The straight line method of depreciation is adopted unless another method is more appropriate for agency operation.



Estimated Useful Life



The Bukidnon State University uses the Schedule on the Estimated Useful Life of PPE by classification prepared by COA.



The Bukidnon State University uses a residual value equivalent to at least five percent(5%) of the cost of the PPE.



Impairment



An asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount, or recoverable service amount, if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable service amount.





Derecognition



The Bukidnon State University derecognizes items of property, plant and equipment and/or any significant part of an asset upon disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected from its continuing use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the surplus or deficit when the asset is derecognized.



3.5 Changes in accounting policies and estimates



The Bukidnon State University recognizes the effects of changes in accounting policy retrospectively. The effects of changes in accounting policy were applied prospectively if retrospective application is impractical.



The Bukidnon State University recognizes the effects of changes in accounting estimates prospectively by including in surplus or deficit.



The Bukidnon State University correct material prior period errors retrospectively in the first set of financial statements authorized for issue after their discovery by:



--	Restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in which the error occurred; or

--	If the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating the opening balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for the earliest prior period presented.



3.6 Budget information



The annual budget is prepared on a cash basis and is published in the government website.



A separate Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts (SCBAA) were prepared since the budget and the financial statements were not prepared on comparable basis. The SCBAA was presented showing the original and final budget and the actual amounts on comparable basis to the budget. Explanatory comments are provided in the notes to the annual financial statements.



3.7 Employee benefits



The employees of Bukidnon State University are member of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), which provides life and retirement insurance coverage.



The Bukidnon State University recognizes the undiscounted amount of short term employee benefits, like salaries, wages, bonuses, allowance, etc., as expense unless capitalized, and as a liability after deducting the amount paid.



The Bukidnon State University recognizes expenses for accumulating compensated absences when these were paid (commuted or paid as terminal leave benefits). An unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date was not recognized as expense. Non-accumulating compensated absences, like special leave privileges, were not recognized.



4.	Prior Period Adjustments



The Bukidnon State University has determined that there were items in the statement of financial position and performance that need to be adjusted for fundamental errors related to prior year’s transactions.



As a result, errors of prior years were corrected by restating the balances of the assets, liabilities and net assets/equity.

PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



Financial and Compliance



1. Various asset and liability accounts amounting to P65,676,017.01 and P5,663,793.47, respectively, remained dormant/non-moving/partially moving in the past 1-5 years, inconsistent with Section II and III of COA Circular 97-001, thus casting doubt on their validity, valuation and fair presentation.



Section II of COA Circular 97-001 defines Dormant Accounts as individual or group of accounts which balances remained non-moving for more than five years while Sec. III provides for the Guidelines in the treatment of Dormant Funds and Accounts. The significant portions are stated below, to wit:



Dormant Funds



When the accounts in the trial balance of a fund or funds are non-moving for five consecutive years, the Chief Accountant or other Officials concerned shall:



1. Initiate/cause the verification of the nature or purpose of the fund.

2. If upon verification the purpose of the fund is found fully completed, discontinued and/or abandoned and no financial transactions are expected, conduct review, analysis, and reconciliation of the subject funds accounts, and determine their existence and validity.	

3. Effect the adjusting journal entries and prepare the preliminary trial balance.

4. Determine proper disposition of reconciled and validated accounts xxx.

	

Our review of the various asset and liability accounts showed that these are non-moving for the past 1-5 years as shown below, the details of which is shown in Appendix A, to wit:

Inventory accounts represent 90% of the total asset accounts which are non-moving.



Sec. 9. Perpetual Inventory Method of the Government Accounting Manual provides that supplies and materials purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running total for the cost of goods sold in each period. The system requires accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the maintenance of the SLC by the Accounting Division/Unit and Stock Card (SC) by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock. Regular purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for supplies and materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense accounts.



Inquiry with management on the non-moving Inventory accounts showed that the root cause of the non-recording of Inventory issuances by the Accounting unit was the difficulty and confusion as to which item in the eNGAS will the RSMI be credited from due to non-existent and/or different Stock Number references between the BAC, Supply Unit  and the Accounting Unit. These three units are respectively in charge of (a) Consolidating the PPMPs and PRs from the end-users; (b) receives, monitors and issues all purchased supplies and likewise provides the Stock No for each item; and (c) Records all purchases, payments, and issuances in the Books of Accounts. See Appendix B for sample documents showing the aforementioned inconsistency of Stock Numbers.

 

The prior year finding on Inventory is reiterated to the extent that there still exist coding inconsistencies between various units in charge with the procurement, monitoring, and recording of supplies.



On the other asset and liability accounts, these represented the prior year balances which are still under reconciliation and tracing.



On the liability accounts, Section 1 of EO 87 provides that all documented accounts payable which remain outstanding for at least two years, for which no actual administrative or judicial claim has been filed shall be subject to automatic reversion.



Sec. 2 likewise provides the same treatment for undocumented accounts payable or those not covered by perfected contracts wherein the same shall be automatically reversed regardless of the year they were incurred. Recording of undocumented accounts payable shall be strictly prohibited.



Similarly, Accounts Payable under the General Fund showed a balance of P660,570.09 which are at least two years and above. Management averred that the said accounts already have valid claims but which have not been processed yet as of year-end.



In view of the above circumstances, the fair presentation of the Financial Statements are deemed affected, especially the overstatement of the Inventory accounts due to non-recording of Inventory issuances for the year and balances for non-moving accounts.



We recommended that management:



(a) For the dormant accounts, comply with the guidelines stated in COA Circular 97-001 and make the necessary adjustments the soonest time possible;



(b) For the Inventory accounts with non-existent/different Stock Numbers among various units, the PPMO who is tasked in setting up the Stock Numbers of all supplies shall coordinate with the BAC who is in-charge of consolidating the PPMPs, the end-users who shall fill up the RIS, and the Accounting Unit who records all purchases and issuances, and thereafter create a systematic procedure of requesting, purchasing and recording wherein the same Stock Number for the various items shall be uniformly used; and

(c) For the Accounts Payable aged at least two years, provide this office with a schedule containing the amount of each payable with an attached copy of the proof of valid claims.



Management Comments:



Management acknowledges the fact that various asset and liability accounts, especially the inventory accounts, remained dormant/non-moving/partially moving.



For this matter, we have effected some adjustments and revisit the accounts as follows:

--	Loans Receivable, Others – This is under “stufap-ched” wherein amount is also equivalent to “CHED” under Due to Other NGAs. We will still search for supporting documents so we could verify such and effect the offsetting.

--	Due from Officers & Employees, Due from NGAs, Guaranty Deposits, and Other Deferred Credits – These were purely balances of Accounts as of 2006 with the transition to eNGAS except for P13,643.50 (Fund 101) and P503,977.82 (Fund STF) attributed to Procurement Service under Due from NGAs during the time of Mr. Cesar Jamero, former Supply Officer, and is still subject for his clearance. Since we do not have the necessary supporting documents to update such, we will be asking your advice on how we will treat these items.

--	Accountable Forms, Plates & Stickers Inventory, Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Inventory (STF) and Other Supplies Inventory – These accounts are under review. We will coordinate with the Supply Office to verify the inventories issued so the Accounting Office could recognize them as expense.

--	Prepaid Rent – This is already adjusted as hereby attached (Attachment 1).

--	Due to NGAs – These accounts are already subject for closure. The return of the unexpended fund under CICT is already in transit as of February 16, 2020 (please refer to Attachment 2). As to CHED and DSWD, reviewing them are ongoing.



The Accounting Office and Property Procurement Management Office had a meeting on February 10, 2021 to discuss the issue on Supply Inventories’ discrepancies and the systematic procedure of recording such. As a matter of fact, both offices have assigned and identified focal persons to monitor these and reconcile on a regular basis. The Accounting Office will follow Section 15 of the Government Accounting Manual in recording the delivered items in the University. By following this procedure hopefully, it will address the root cause of the non-recording of Inventory issuances which represent the most of the Dormant Assets. Moreover, the PPMO will first update the stock number assignments in the system since it started with inputs in the PMS and will also seek the help of the ICTU who is the administrator of the system as stated in their reply (please refer to Attachment 3).



We have already reverted Accounts Payable for which remained outstanding for at least 2 years last December 2020 by virtue of GAM Chapter 6, Section 29. We have attached such adjustments with its supporting schedules instead per fund (Attachment 4).



Henceforth, adherence to the aforementioned provision in Section II and III of COA Circular 97-001 and Section 15 of the Government Accounting Manual will be strictly monitored.





2. 	The reported balance of PPE accounts totalling P1,600,952,581.14 as of December 31, 2020 was unreliable due to unreconciled balance of P219,445,128.95 between the accounting records and property records contrary to Section 111 of PD 1445; Sections 38, 42 and 44 of Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs Volume 1.



Section 111 of   the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines   provides that  -  (1) The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government and (2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. 

	Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1 provides that the entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of   the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording.

Moreover, Section  42 thereof provides that the Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like PAR.



Under sequence No. 5 of Section 44 of the same manual on the procedures in the recording of receipt, inspection and acceptance of PPE, the Supply and/or Property Custodian is to receive the item/s from the Property Inspector, and assigns property number on the PPE received and indicate the same on the IAR. 



Reconciliation is a process to compare two sets of records to ensure the figures are in agreement and are accurate. It should be noted that without reconciling the results of the physical counts of assets, specifically the PPE,  with the accounting records, the purpose of the inventory taking, which is to ascertain the existence of the recorded PPEs in the books of accounts, is negated.

	

Comparison of the result of the RPCPPE as of December 31, 2020 and the balances (at cost) of the PPE accounts of the same period, Library Books and CIP not included, (see Appendix C) showed a variance of P219M.  No physical count on the Library Books was conducted as of December 31, 2020 hence not included in the comparison of the property and accounting records. Physical count/inventory is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship.



Based on the table, the variance can either be the total PPE or per account. The variance can also be due to the difference in classifying an item in a specific PPE account as shown in the table below.

Based on the table above, there is inconsistency on how the same item was classified into a specific PPE account as well as the amount recorded as its cost.  In the comparison of the RPCPPE and the schedule it was also discovered that the property number of the same asset differs.



	Another factor is the non inclusion of the lands donated by various LGUs for use of the satellite campus.  The RPCPPE as of December 31, 2020 submitted to the Auditor’s Office did not include donated properties, when in fact PPMO has a copy of the deed of donations.



	Our Office issued audit observation  in previous years that the accounting office and the PPMO had initiated initially the reconciliation of their respective records, however it was learned that this was not done regularly hence  discrepancy still exist.



Failure to conduct the physical count of the library books by the Inventory Committee and conduct the regular reconciliation of both accounting and property records and inconsistency in the classification of properties in the appropriate PPE accounts resulted in the discrepancy between accounting records and the RPCPPE, thus casting doubt on the accuracy of the PPE in the Financial Statement.



	We recommended that management form a task force or assign personnel from both the Accounting and PPMO who will conduct the physical inventory and reconciliation of the PPE records (amount, property number and classification of PPE account) including inventory of Library Books in the annual physical count and pass the inventory report to our office.



Management Comments:



Management acknowledges the fact that the accounting records and property records are unreconciled, thus, contrary to Section 111 of PD 1445; Sections 38, 42 and 44 of Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume 1.



There are already assigned personnel from the Accounting Office and Property and Procurement Management Office respectively, which will be composed of the Task Force for the conduct of physical inventory and reconciliation of the PPE records. They are currently coordinating with one another. Moreover, a Certificate of Demolition will be secured from the CAO as support to drop demolished PPE items still recorded in the eNGAs.





3.  Lands acquired thru donation with condition in the total amount of P22,933,127.00 were recorded as Income from Grants and Donations, contrary to Section 3 & 13, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1, thus overstating the income and understating the liability account in the Financial Statement as of December 31, 2020 and affects the fair presentation of the account Land in a particular period respectively.



Section 15, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1 provides that Financial Statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 9 recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSAS. The application of PPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.



For the proper recognition of the property, chapter 10 of the same manual provides:



Moreover, Section 3 also provides that the cost of an item of PPE shall be recognized as assets if, and only if: 



a. it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to the entity; 

b. the cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably; 

c. beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the government; 

d. the asset is used to achieve government objectives; and 

e. it meets the capitalization threshold of P15,000.   

                                                                                                                                  

And  Section 13 provides that where a PPE is acquired through donation with conditions or restrictions, a liability account shall be recognized until the conditions or restrictions have been fulfilled.  The account Other Deferred Credits should be used for this type of transaction.



Verification of the journal entry ( JEV No. 2020-12-0173, dated  December 29, 2020) drawn to record the donated lands amounting to P29,308,145.94 for BukSU satellite campuses showed  a credit to the account Income from Grants and Donations. Summary of the land donated to BukSU.

The management signed a Usufruct Agreement with the LGUs of Impasug-ong, Kadingilan and Malitbog, all from Bukidnon for the use of a land where the satellite campus is located in their locality.



Recording the lands covered with conditional donation to Income from Grants and Donations has overstated the income of the University by P22,933,127.00 (22,800,000.00 plus 133,127.00) and understated the Other Deferred Credit account by the same amount thus affecting the fairness of the Financial statement of the current year.



Non-recording of the land in the books during the time it was donated and documents pertaining to the transaction was available has affected the fairness of the FS during that particular period.



We recommended that management reclassify the treatment of the land covered by conditional agreement on donation from Income from Grants and Donations to Other Deferred credits and promptly record the transaction when the conditions are met.



Management Comments:



Management acknowledges the fact that Land acquired thru donation with condition was recorded as Income from Grants and Donations, contrary to Section 3 & 13, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.



The donation of Land made by the Local Government of Quezon and of Baungon to Bukidnon State University is under Deed on Conditional Donation. One of the conditions is “that the donated property can only be used by the Donee solely for educational purposes.” Since there is no timeframe of the fulfillment of the condition, we asked for an advice from one of the Lawyers in the College of Law. Accordingly, since the ownership of the Land is transferred to Bukidnon State University and the donation will only be reverted back to the Donor when the Donee fails to comply with the donation, it will also be appropriate that Bukidnon State University will only recognize the donated land as a liability once Bukidnon State University fails to comply with the condition underlying the deed of donation and when it becomes demandable from the University.



Nevertheless, we will be asking your advice on how to recognized such and we will conform to such recommendation.



4. The reported balance of Inventory accounts totalling P64,488,306.32 as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to discrepancy of P32,826,380.75 between the accounting records and property records and not strictly observing the policy on the recording and monitoring of receipt items, contrary to Section 111 of PD 1445; Sections 7 & 15 of Chapter 10 and Section 13 of Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume I.



The Government Auditing Code of the Philippines (P.D. 1445) prescribes the following 

rules and regulations in the recording and keeping of agency’s accounts:

	

	Section 111.	Keeping of accounts -  (1) The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. (2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. 

	Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1 covers the definition, recognition, measurement, cost formulas to be used and related disclosure requirement in accordance with PPSAS 12 on Inventories. It includes specific guidelines and procedures on acquisition, issue, disposal and impairment of inventory and defines the benchmark for those tangible items not enough to be considered as Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE).  The chapter provides:

	Sec. 7. Recognition as an Expense. When inventories are sold, exchanged, or distributed, their carrying amount shall be recognized as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. If there is no related revenue, the expense is recognized when the goods are distributed or the related service is rendered.

Sec. 15. Procedures in the Receipt, Inspection, Acceptance and Recording of Deliveries of Inventory Items.

Under Section 13 of Chapter 6 this manual, an illustrative accounting entry was provided specifically for purchases at the Procurement Service, viz.



Advance payment to Procurement Service:



Service Due from NGAs 		10303010 	P 2,500 

Cash-Modified Disbursement 

System (MDS), Regular 	10104040 		P 2,500 



To recognize advance payment to Procurement Service for the purchase of Office Equipment. 



In Chapter 8, following the usual procedure, a debit to an Inventory account is recorded by the accounting office when the item is received and following Section 7, is expensed when sold, exchanged, or distributed.



However, in the case of purchases at the Procurement Services (PS), a check is drawn on the basis of the approved Agency Procurement Request (APR) even before the items are received by the procuring entity.  But there are situations wherein the PS could not deliver all the items requested and paid by the agency as what the University has experienced a few times.



In the review of compliance in the procedures in the receipt, inspection, acceptance and recording of deliveries of Inventory Items by the Accounting Office and the Procurement and Property Management Office (PPMO), we observed some deficiencies.



Variance between accounting and PPMO records.



A comparison of the balances of each inventory accounts and the result of the physical count of inventories showed a variance of P32,826,380.75 (Appendix D).  This can be attributed to the failure of the accounting office to recognized expense for distributed inventory items (reason is also explained in a separate AOM involving inventory).



Inconsistency with the recording of the purchases from the PS DBM.



Purchases during the year, totaling P1,021,693.82  were either recorded as Other Receivables or an Inventory account (Appendix E) instead of recording a receivable  from the PS DBM as suggested by the manual.  No journal entries were made to recognize actual receipts of the items purchased due to failure of the Supply office to forward  of the PO, IAR and DR of the delivered items to the accounting office.  Without the mentioned documents, liability of PS DBM on undelivered items would not be recorded in the books of the University.



Not adhering to the policy on the proper recording and monitoring the receipt of inventories, and the variance between the accounting records and the RPCI would affect that accuracy of the accounts (Inventory and Due from NGA) and cast doubts on the existence of the reported balance in the FS respectively.









We recommended that management:



(a) Recognize an expense account for distributed items;

(b) Be consistent in using the suggested accounting entry for purchases from PS DBM by establishing the cost of undelivered items;



(c) Require the Supply Officer to regularly forward copies of the PO, DR and IAR to the accounting office for recognizing receipt of purchased items and monitoring of undelivered purchases; and



d)		Follow up from PS DBM the undelivered items or request refund.



Management Comments:



Management acknowledges the fact that there is discrepancy between the accounting records and property records.



a)	The Accounting-PPMO Task Force are coordinating with one another. Accounting will recognize as expense the distributed items based on the report prepared by the PPMO.

b)	Supply and Property Management Office will first update our account in the PS DBM in order to establish the cost of undelivered items, and submit to the Accounting Office the total amount of the receivables. Subsequently, the Accounting Office will then set-up receivable.

c)	The procedure in the GAM has been reviewed and such will be observed in coordination with the PPMO.  Starting February 2021, PPMO will submit a receiving report to the Accounting Office for every delivery received. This report will be supported with a copy of the Purchase Order and Delivery Receipt/Charge Invoice, in order for the Accounting Office to reconcile with our Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) monthly.

d)	PPMO contacted PS DBM with regard to those undelivered items through phone calls and physical follow-ups. Moreover, a letter will be prepared for such follow-up and probably, next month after the receivables from PS DBM for the previous items affected by the change of prices will be established, a request for refund will be made.



5. Nine out of the fifteen Accountable Officers were not able to completely prepare/present the Cash Disbursements Record and the Petty Cash Fund Record during the conduct of the Cash Examination contrary to Section 6 of COA Circular 97-002 and Section 6, Chapter II of the Revised Cash Examination Manual, thus, disbursements were not effectively monitored causing delay in the preparation of the required Cash Examination Reports.



Section 6 of COA Circular 97-002 provides for the guidelines in the Handling, Custody and Disposition of the Cashbook of which the relevant procedures are as follows:

6.2 The AO shall maintain separate cashbooks for salaries, wages, allowances, etc. and for petty operating expenses. The AO shall record the transactions in the prescribed cashbook daily. He may record each invoice/ receipt/voucher individually or the total disbursements for the day depending on the volume of the transactions.

6.4 The cashbooks shall be kept at the Office of the AO and then placed inside the safe or cabinet when not in use. It may be taken from his custody only by the Auditor or an official duly authorized by the Agency Head, who shall issue the necessary receipt.



Section 6, Chapter IIof the Revised Cash Examination Manual provides that that an AO shall maintain his cashbook/CRR/CDR/CkDR and such other records or their equivalent as may be prescribed by the agency’s operating procedures, and reconcile with the accounting records at least quarterly, unless the agency requires a more frequent reconciliation.



Our conduct of the Cash Examination disclosed that majority of the Accountable Officers were not able to present/prepare the required Cash Disbursements Record/Petty Cash Fund Record. The subject reports were submitted only after several days/weeks from the time the Resident Auditor requested them from the Accountable Officers since they alleged that they were not aware that such reports were required of them.



The delayed submission/non-preparation of the Cash Disbursements Record/PCF Record precludes the auditor from the timely preparation of the cash examination reports required. Moreover, on the part of the agency, delayed preparation/non-preparation of the AO’s required reports prevents them from monitoring and reconciling the transactions involved in the Cash Advances.



We recommended that management orient Accountable Officers on the proper 

recording of the transactions and other matters related to his/her work; and record daily all transactions in their respective Cash Disbursements Record/PCF Record.



	Management Comments:



Management acknowledges the fact that the keeping of cashbooks by Accountable Officers weren’t strictly implemented and monitored.



With the rise of new Accountable Officers, the practice of preparing the Cash Disbursement Record or Petty Cash Fund weren’t sustained/introduced.



For this matter, we will be holding a Re-Orientation of the Accountable Officers on the proper recording of the transactions and other matters related to his/her work; and record daily all transactions in their respective Cash Disbursement Record/PCF Record as duly recommended.

	6. Three Accountable Officers of External Studies Centers who are not regular employees of the university are performing Collection functions were found to be not bonded or has expired fidelity bond, contrary to Section 101 of PD 1445 and Section 7.1 of COA Circular 97-002, thus posing a risk that the government agency concerned will not be adequately indemnified in the event of embezzlement or other kind of losses of the AOs cash and accounts.

Section 101 of PD 1445 provides that every officer of any government agency whose 

duties permit or require the possession or custody of government funds or property shall be accountable therefor and for the safekeeping thereof in conformity with law and should be bonded.

Section 7.1 of COA Circular 97-002 likewise provides that each accountable officer with a total cash accountability of P2,000.00 or more shall be bonded. The amount of bond shall depend on the total accountability of the officer as fixed by the Head of the Agency.



Upon examination of the Accountable Officers and verification of the related records, it was noted that Collecting Officers in Montevista ESC and Trento ESC are not bonded and no application has been processed as of this writing.



Likewise, in the case of Gingoog ESC, the Collecting Officer is bonded but expired last Feb. 20, 2020. In the cash examination conducted on August 5, 2020, records showed that there were still collections made by the accountable officer until June 2020.



Upon inquiry with management, the non-bonding of the subject AOs was due to the fact that the Bureau of Treasury would not approve the bond application since the said personnel are not regular employees of Bukidnon State University.

 

The absence of a Fidelity Bond for Collecting/Disbursing Officers poses a risk to the government agency concerned in terms of not being indemnified in the event of embezzlement or other kind of losses of the AOs cash and accounts.

		We recommended that management appoint personnel who are regular to the Agency and if not feasible, establish a procedure of collecting payments through bank transfer and other online mechanisms to the credit of BukSU Main; and see to it that all Accountable Officers are duly bonded during the period of their incumbency.

		Management Comments:

Management acknowledges the fact that some of its Collecting Officers in the External Studies Centers aren’t bonded due to their non-regular status and unavailability of a regular personnel since these Centers were closed. Accordingly, a response by Gingoog ESC was already forwarded and received by your good office.



For this matter, we will adhere to the recommendation of establishing a procedure of collecting payments to see to it that all Accountable Officers are duly bonded during the period of their incumbency.

	7.   Advance dating in the issuance of certain Continuous Accountable Forms of ESC Iligan were noted contrary to the Government Accounting Manual and PD 1445 – ‘Government Auditing Code of the Philippines’, thus, casting doubt on the reliability of the Collection Procedures and Systems of the said office.

Sec. 4(h), Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM states that ‘Pre-numbered ORs shall be issued in strict numerical sequence. All copies of each receipt shall be exact copies or carbon reproduction in all respects of the original.’



Upon the conduct of Cash Examination of Iligan ESC on July 28, 2020, it was discovered that there were Continuous Form ORs which were already dated in advance or after July 28, 2020. See Table 1 below.

			The accountable officer alleged that a cut-off of the report of collections and deposit for the month of July 2020 was already prepared when the payments were received which we know is not reasonable. In view of such, there exists a presumption that the system being used in the issuance of the continuous accountable forms for payments made by students cannot be relied upon and that it can be a means of committing irregularities in the process of collections.   

		We recommended that management review and improve the existing collection system of ESC – Iligan and have it checked for procedural and system lapses and such review and improvement be applied to all other Satellite Campuses who are using the Continuous Form for Collections.

		Management Comments:

Management acknowledges the fact that certain Continuous Accountable Forms of ESC Iligan were noted contrary to the Government Accounting Manual and PD 1445 – Government Auditing Code of the Philippines’. Accordingly, a response made by Iligan ESC was already forwarded and received by your good office on November 11, 2020.

		For this matter, we will review the existing collection system of ESC-Iligan and have it checked for procedural and system lapses as recommended and look for areas to improve so we could also apply such for this who are using the Continuous Form for Collections.

	8.  Inconsistencies in the timelines of the Contract of Goods, Purchase Orders and Notices to Proceed have been observed contrary to RA 9184 – ‘2016 Revised IRR’ and the Government Procurement Manual Volume 2, thus causing delay in the implementation of the related contracts.

The 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184 provides for the following provisions related to the Contract Signing and issuance of Notice to Proceed, to wit: 



Sec. 37.2.1. The winning bidder shall post the required Performance Security and enter into contract with the Procuring Entity within ten (10) calendar days from receipt by the winning bidder of the Notice of Award.



37.4.1. The concerned Procuring Entity shall issue the Notice to Proceed together with a copy or copies of the approved contract to the successful bidder within seven (7) calendar days from the date of approval of the contract by the appropriate government approving authority. All notices called for by the terms of the contract shall be effective only at the time of receipt thereof by the successful bidder.



38.1. The procurement process from the opening of bids up to the award of contract shall not exceed three (3) months, or a shorter period to be determined by the Procuring Entity concerned. Xxx.



38.2. The maximum periods and the recommended earliest possible time for action on specific procurement activities are provided in the IRR. In case the deadline for each activity falls on a non-working day (i.e. Saturday and Sunday), legal holiday, or special non-working holiday, the deadline shall be the next working day.



Examination of various Contracts of Goods received during the Calendar Year 2020 showed the following:



a)	The approval/issuance of the Contract and the Purchase Order were made on different dates hence causing confusion as to when the seven (7) day period for the issuance of the Notice to Proceed shall commence to run;

b)	The Notices to Proceed were issued beyond 7 days from the date of the approval of the Contract contrary to Sec. 37.4.1;

c)	The Notices to Proceed were issued beyond 7 days from the date of the approval of the Purchase Order contrary to Sec. 37.4.1.



See Appendix F for the detailed presentation of the above observations.



On another note, it was also observed that the Contract of Goods are not being Notarized. Though said contracts were already signed by the HOPE and the winning bidder and thus already legally binding between the parties, the contract is nevertheless advised to be notarized to convert them into public documents and make the same enforceable against third parties. Notarization of the contract is implicit to Step 8, Volume 2, Manual for the Procurement of Goods which states that “The Procuring Entity’s Signatory is encouraged to sign within the same day as the signing of the bidder as there are penalties against delaying, without justifiable cause, the award of the contract (2016 IRR, Section 65). Moreover, it would be best for the winning bidder and the Head of the Procuring Entity, or its appropriate signing authority, to sign/execute the contract together – provided that all contract documents and requirements are complete – so that both may personally appear before a Notary Public.” This is to protect the interest of the Procuring Entity in the event that the winning bidder defaults in the performance of their obligation and further, conversion of the contracts to public documents would make them admissible in court without the need for further proof of authentication.

		In view of the circumstances relating to the inconsistencies in the procurement timeline and notwithstanding the fact that the procurement process from the Bid Opening to the issuance of the Notice to Proceed did not exceed three months as stated in Sec. 31.1, there still occurred a delay in the implementation of the related contracts since if the seven (7) day period in the issuance of the NTP was followed, the performance of the contract could have started earlier and the related goods could have been delivered to the procuring entity on an earlier period.

		We recommended that management require the signing of the Contract Agreement and the Purchase Order shall be made on the same day in order to have a uniform date from where the counting of the seven (7) day period for the issuance of the NTP shall commence, for the benefit of the government.

		Management Comments:

The procedure, as practiced in Bukidnon State University is:



1) The Procuring Entity (PE) informs the winning bidder through a Notice of Award.

2) The PE sends the winning bidder a Contract of Agreement for the bidder to acknowledge and accept.

3) The bidder signs the Contract of Agreement and returns it to the PE. The PE then prepares a Purchase Order (PO). The date of preparation of PO is indicated on the top of the page but it is not the same as the approval by the President. This is due to the time allotted for review by the Internal Audit Service, Budget and Finance Office before being endorsed to the President for signature.

4) After the PO is approved by the President, a Notice to Proceed is prepared for signature of the President. The Notice to Proceed states “The attached Contract having been approved, notice is being given...may commence effectively upon receipt of the Purchase Order and this Notice.” The date of preparation of Notice to Proceed may not be the same as the date of approval by the president.



The issuance of the Notice to Proceed is beyond 7 days from the approval of contract due to the preparation, approval and issuance of the Purchase Order.



The Notice to Proceed is beyond 7 days from the date of preparation of the Purchase Order but not from the date of its approval. There is an intervening time from the preparation and approval of the document.



The Bids and Awards Committee for Goods and Services notes the difference in the dates of the Contract Award and Purchase Order as these documents are prepared sequentially, not simultaneously.



The Bids and Awards Committee for Goods and Services notes and acknowledges the aforementioned deviations and resolves to adhere to the required timelines as stipulated in the 2016 Revised IRR if RA 9184.



Specifically, for the year 2021, it will institute the following changes/actions to rectify the aforementioned deviations:



1) To prepare the Contract of Agreement and Purchase Order on the same date.

2) If possible, the HOPE and the winning bidder will sign on the same day in order to have a uniform date of reckoning for the 7 day period for the issuance of the NTP.

3) Request the Office of the President to time-stamp the date when the President signs the Contract of Agreement, Purchase Order and Notice to Proceed.

4) Require the acknowledgement by Notary Public of the Contract of Agreement by both parties.

9.  Delayed utilization of project/s due to incomplete structural analysis and non-provision of interior requirements deprived the end-user and/or the general public of the benefits that could have been derived thereon.



The Government Auditing Code of the Philippines declares in its Declaration of Policy that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, xxx, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government.



Section 3 of the Government Procurement Manual Volume 1 covers Procurement Planning. In the 2nd paragraph of the section on Procurement Planning and Budget Linkage, it is stated that ‘Through plans, a Procuring Entity is able to effectively manage and track procurement all the way to contract performance. As such, it allows managers to determine how to allocate limited cash and other appropriate resources under a given time line and identify choke-points, weaknesses, and delays in the entire activity that can be addressed or eliminated.’



Also in the section on Procurement Planning-Preparation of the PPMP, the sub-section on Writing the Technical Specifications, Scope of Work and Terms of Reference states that ‘Quality Assurance actually starts at this stage of the procurement cycle, considering that the deliverables are decided at this time. It is therefore important that all stakeholders are consulted, and the actual requirements of the PMO or end-user or implementing unit are determined and put in writing.’



Inquiries made during the ocular inspection of On-Going and Completed projects yielded the following information:



a)	The construction of the 5-Storey Training Laboratory & Equipment for HRM Phase I was temporarily stopped due to the non-preparation of the Structural Analysis. Below is a table containing the relevant timeline of the said project.

		Consultation with the related units/departments has failed to clearly show which unit is primarily tasked in the preparation of the subject document.

		

		In view of the said lapse in planning and coordination, the above project has been significantly delayed which deprived the end-users of the benefits that could have been received at an earlier period. 

			

b)	The new Medical and Dental Clinic located at the Health Services Building which was completed last July 30, 2020 based on the Certificate of Completion has not been occupied yet by the end-users as of December 31, 2020.



Inquiry with the implementing unit end-users showed the following circumstances:



Per Dental Clinic end-user/s, there has been a delay in the occupation of the new area since the technical aspects related to the installation and operation of the Dental Equipment and other facilities were not installed yet. The implementing unit tried to process and the complete the request for the same in 2020 but was cut-short due to the closing of the accounts/books for the year. Hence, the persons concerned committed to process the said facilities the earliest time possible in 2021.



To date, the area assigned for the Medical Clinic has likewise not yet been occupied by the intended occupants.



Assessing the preceding situation, it can be inferred that there might have been a lapse in the coordination between the end-users and the implementing unit such that there were items that were not included in the Plans/Technical Specifications hence not included in the main construction plans. In effect, said items have to be requested after the project completion precluding the end-user from timely utilizing the subject facilities.



	We recommended that management continually review the duties and responsibilities of each unit involved in the Procurement Process to avoid oversights in the preparation of procurement documents and ensure proper coordination between the implementing unit/s and end-user/s such that all the specifications needed for the suitable and timely utilization of the end-user of constructed/requested facilities are incorporated in the Plans/Technical Specifications.



Management Comments:



The delay on the said projects was on the following reasons:



1) The Request for Quotation for the Structural Analysis and Soil Investigation/Analysis were not processed at once due to lack of prospective suppliers.

2) The movement of the procurement process during the pandemic period was affected which contributed to the delay of the transactions.



For the Medical Clinic and Dental Clinic:



Per records, the construction of the Health Services Building was completed last July 30, 2020. However, the interior facilities on the said offices were not included in the Contract of Construction of the Health Services Building. A separate Purchase Order for the renovation of the 2 offices was made and we have attached the PO and date of completion based on their final billing for both projects. Furthermore, drafting of the final plans for their respective interior facilities were both coordinated with the end-users before the processing of the Purchase Request for construction/renovation.



10. On-going  Infrastructure Projects were observed to have no signboard displayed at the project location in violation of COA Circular 2013-004 – ‘Information and Publicity on Programs/Projects/Activities of Government Agencies’, thus dispensing the principles of good governance through transparency and accountability.



Sec. 2 of COA Circular 2013-004 provides the General Guidelines for the Information and Publicity of PPAs. Item 2.2.3 specifically provides that a tarpaulin signboard must be suitably framed for outdoor display at the project location, and shall be posted as soon as the award has been made. Xxx.



The same sub-section likewise enumerates the design and format of the required tarpaulin.



During the conduct of the semestral ocular inspection of On-Going and Completed Projects last December 15, 2020, it was observed that several infrastructures projects at BukSU Annex A did not have the required tarpaulin displayed at the project location, to wit:



a)	Construction of College of Education Laboratory SLS Phase-I

b)	Construction of Road Network Drainage System and Parking Areas

c)	Construction of 3-Storey COE Laboratory ELS Phase-I

d)	Lot B Supply and Installation of Transformer and other Electrical Lining

e)	Supply and Installation of Solar Perimeter Street Light



The absence of signboards in the construction site and the lack of complete and relevant information in its postings deprived public participation and the right of the people to information on matters of public concern, thus failing to promote transparency and accountability.



We recommended that management immediately require all contractors to provide the tarpaulin signboards on all on-going projects and to conduct proper orientation or dissemination as required under COA Circular 2013-004.



Management Comments:



The projects that were mentioned during the conduct of ocular inspection were mostly located at our Annex Campus A, Casisang, Malaybalay City. As such, these projects have their signboards but during the construction process, they have to be continuously relocated due to the movement of their materials and equipment. They eventually forgot to place it back.



11. The capitalization threshold in classifying the purchased item as PPE was not observed, and some items purchased in the prior years with cost below the P15,000.00 remained in various PPE accounts, contrary to Section 10 & 11 of Chapter 8; Sections 3 & 4, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume 1, thus overstating the PPE account and understating the Expense and the Accumulated Surplus accounts in the Financial Statements.

Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1 speaks of the semi expendable items to wit:



Sec. 10. Semi-expendable Property. Tangible items below the capitalization threshold of P15,000 shall be accounted as semi-expendable property. The following policies apply as follows: 

a. Semi-expendable property which were recognized as PPE shall be reclassified to the affected accounts. 

b. These tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon issue to the end-user. 



Sec. 11. Accountability over Semi-expendable Property. Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) shall be issued to end-user of Semi-expendable Property to establish accountability over them. Accountability shall be extinguished upon return of the item to the Property and Supply Division/Unit or in case of loss, upon approval of the relief from property accountability.



Chapter 10, Sec. 3 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1 provides that the cost of an item of PPE shall be recognized as assets if, and only if: 



a. it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to the entity; 

b. the cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably; 

c. beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the government; 

d. the asset is used to achieve government objectives; and 

e. it meets the capitalization threshold of P15,000.                                                                                                                                     



Sec. 4. Applying the Capitalization Threshold of P15,000. The capitalization threshold of P15,000 represents the minimum cost of an individual asset recognized as a PPE on the Statement of Financial Position. 



a)	Items with individual values below the threshold but which work together in the form of a group of network asset whose total value exceeds the threshold shall be recognized as part of the primary PPE. (Example: computer network, PABX system, sewerage system). 



 Expenditures incurred on purchasing, developing, and operating hardware, like web servers, staging servers, production servers and internet connections of a website is accounted for as PPE if the total value of the primary asset (communications networks) and these items is within the threshold of P15,000 and above. 



b)	This threshold shall be applied on an individual asset or per item basis. Each item within the bulk acquisition with aggregate or total value of PPE, such as library books, computer peripherals and small items of equipment, will need to meet the capitalization threshold to be recognized as PPE. (underscore supplied)

Verification on the submitted schedule of various PPE accounts as of December 31, 2020 disclosed inclusion of items purchased in CY 2020 with cost below P15,000.00. A sample of the items below P15,000.00 that were recorded as PPE in the General Fund, specifically under the account Medical and Dental laboratory Equipment is shown in a table  attached as Appendix G amounting to P266,114.65 in book value of which P145,000.00 were purchased in CY 2020.

Recording purchased item that did not meet the capitalization threshold as PPE and items acquired in prior years costing below P15,000 which still treated as PPE would result to the overstatement of the particular PPE account and understate the expense and Accumulated Surplus account, thus affecting the accuracy of the affected accounts  in the Financial Statement.



We recommended that management reclassify the items that did not met the capitalization threshold to expense account (if issued within the year), or accumulated surplus/(deficit (if issued in prior years) and issue Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) to establish accountability over the semi-expendable property.



Management Comments:



	Management acknowledges the fact that the capitalization threshold in classifying the purchased item as PPE was not observed, and some items purchased in prior years with cost below the P15,000.00 remains in the various PPE accounts.



12. Some items in the PPE were not provided with depreciation and/or with negative balances and properties were recorded in lump amount affects the accuracy of the valuation of the affected properties  in the Financial Statement  contrary to Sections 8, 22 & 27 of Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1.



	Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs , Volume 1 provides:

	Sec. 8. Purchase of PPE. PPE acquired through purchase are charged against appropriations/allotments or special budget for capital outlay. PPE can be purchased on cash basis, on account, on installment basis, with promotional items, and at a lump sum price. 

	e. At a lump sum price. In case the acquisition of PPE is at a “lump sum price”, the cost shall be apportioned to the asset acquired in order to have proper basis for computing depreciation. The purchase cost shall be distributed based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired.

		The cost of several PPE purchased at lump sum price per set/group/lot shall be allocated to each PPE based on the breakdown of cost reflected in the invoice, if any. In the absence of such breakdown, the allocation of cost shall be based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired.

	Sec. 22. Measurement after Recognition. For consistency and uniformity, the cost model shall be applied to an entire class of PPE. Cost model means that PPE are carried at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.

		Sec. 27. Depreciation. PPE gradually loses its ability to provide service over the course of time. Because of this, its cost needs to be distributed on a systematic basis over its useful life. The allocated cost is referred to as depreciation. The depreciation charge for each period shall be recognized as expense unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset. For example, the depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment is included in the costs of conversion of inventories. Similarly, depreciation of PPE used for development activities may be included in the cost of an intangible asset recognized.

Verification on the random sample of properties in the PPE schedule showed some deficiencies:



Description

Remarks

Purchase of 1 lot real property with buildings (BukSU Hotel) in the amount of P45,569,376.53-Other Structures (164)

The land and two buildings were recorded as one item in the account Other structures and the depreciation reported in the same item.

Concrete pavers at the exit gate (Main) acquired  on Aug. 7, 2020 in the amount of P123,750.00-Other Structure (164)

No depreciation expense recognized.

Refrigerator (Budget) acquired on Sept. 8, 2020 in the amount of P28,000.00-Office Equipment (164)

No depreciation expense recognized

Laptop Dell in -5391(Office of the BOT) acquired in Aug. 18, 2020 in the amount of PP65,900.00 (Equipment and Software (164)

No depreciation expense recognized

Furniture and Fixtures (Kindergarten) acquired on Dec. 29, 2017 with no data as to cost (Furniture & Fixture)-IGP

An accumulated Depreciation of P14,850 was reflected with a net book value of the same amount in  negative figure.

Computer set-Libertad ESC acquired on July 12, 2013 in the amount of P12,502.70 (IT Equipment & Software) (External Centers)

Accumulated Depreciaion is at P21,192.13 and an negative net book value  of P8,689.43



It was learned that for the errors in the non recognition of depreciation or accumulated depreciation reflects more than the cost of some items were technical in nature.   In the process of recording the transaction in the E-NGAS (accounting software) a process could have been skipped. 

 

Non allocation to each PPE the amount used in the acquisition of the 3 items in lump price would result to an erroneous computation of the depreciation expense; and not recording of depreciation expense or erroneous recognition of depreciation beyond its cost would affect the accuracy of the Depreciation Expense, the Accumulated Depreciation as well as the presentation of the PPE accounts in the Financial Statement at year end.



We recommended that management instruct the accounting office to assign from its personnel who will review and analyse the schedule of PPE and adjust the errors detected (items purchased in lump sum  and recorded as one item, unrecorded and errors in the depreciation and accumulated depreciation respectively) for accuracy in the accounts.



Management Comments:



	Management acknowledges the fact that some items in the PPE were not provided with depreciation and/or with negative balances and properties were recorded in lump sum amount.



	The schedule of PPE is now under review and monitoring of the assigned personnel. Other items that are deemed necessary to be reclassified will be reclassified. The land component of the Hotel recognized in Other Structures will be transferred to land. Those PPE items purchased in lump sum and recorded as one item will be verified if they meet the capitalization threshold (15,000.00) on an item-to-item bases. Otherwise, such will be reclassified as semi-expendable properties.

	

13. The concerned official failed to submit the  request for relief from accountability and other supporting documents on the lost digital camera which prevented management and the audit team to conduct the necessary investigation and assess the circumstances  in the lost items, failure to set up a receivable from the accountability of the accountable officer and simultaneous derecognition of the PPE affects the accuracy and fairness of presentation of the affected accounts in the Financial Statements contrary to Section 41, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume 1.



	Section 41, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies, Volume 1  provides the accounting policies on loss of property are as follows:  

 

a)	When a loss of government funds or property occurs while they are in transit or the loss is caused by fire, theft, or other casualty or force majeure, the officer accountable therefore or having custody thereof shall immediately notify the Commission or the auditor concerned and, within thirty days or such longer period as the Commission or auditor may in the particular case allow, shall present his applicable for relief, with the available supporting evidence. Whenever warranted by the evidence credit for the loss shall be allowed. An officer who fails to comply with this requirement shall not be relieved of liability or allowed credit for any loss in the settlement of his accounts. (Sec. 73, P.D. No. 1445) 



b)	Lost property and the related accumulated depreciation and impairment loss shall be derecognized in the books upon receipt of the Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) (Appendix 75) supported by a Notice of Loss prepared and submitted by the Accountable Officer. The loss shall be charged to account “Loss of Assets” at an amount equal to its carrying amount.



Established accountability of the accountable officer:

Sample Computation: 

Cost of Medical Equipment 		P200,000 

Accumulated Depreciation 	    	    38,000 

Accumulated Impairment Loss 	    34,000 

Net Carrying Value (Loss of Asset)   P128,000 



c)	The accountability of the accountable officer over the loss of depreciable asset shall be based on depreciated replacement cost (DRC) PPSAS 21 par. 45. DRC is replacement cost less accumulated depreciation calculated on the basis of replacement cost. 



Sample Computation: 

Replacement Cost (Current market price) P150,000 

Accumulated Depreciation 			54,000 

Depreciated replacement cost 	         P 96,000 



d)	A receivable account shall be set up to record the accountability of the accountable officer simultaneous with derecognition of the lost PPE.



Verification conducted on the Report of the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment of the University as of December 31, 2020 disclosed two (2) units of digital camera with a unit value of P54,000.00 was reported missing.  Accordingly this happened during the transfer of the College of Education to the new building at the Annex A located at Barangay, Casisang, Malaybalay City.  The concerned accountable officer has failed to notify this office as soon as  the lost occurred or was discovered and failed to  submit  her request for relief from accountability with the documentary requirements within the 30-day prescribed period.  



Query with the accounting office also disclosed that their office was not informed and no report nor documents on the reported lost were submitted thus no receiveable was set up to  record the accountability  as well as the derecognition of the lost items.



Non submission of request for relief from accountability and other supporting documents prevented the management and audit team to conduct the necessary investigation and assess the circumstances on the lost items, failure to  set up a receivable from the accountability of the accountable officer and simultaneous derecognition of the PPE affects the accuracy and fairness of presentation of the affected account.



We recommended that management:



(a) Inform their personnel the policy on lost items and require the concerned accountable officer to submit the request for relief from accountability with the required supporting documents within 30 days from receipt of this report;



(b) Require the Accountant to set up the receivable to recognize the accountability of the concerned accountable officer; and



(c) Derecognize the lost PPE.



Management Comments:



	Management acknowledges the fact that the due non submission of request for relief from accountability and other supporting documents, the management and audit team was not able to conduct the necessary investigation and assess the circumstances on the lost items, thus, affects the accuracy and fairness of the presentation of the affected accounts in the Financial Statements.



	To adhere to the requirement on submission of the request for relief from accountability, we have notified on February 16, 2021 the accountable officer, the Dean of the College of Education, with regards to the issuance of this Audit Memorandum Observation (AOM) due to the two (2) units of digital camera in her accountability that were reported missing during the conduct of the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment of the University as of December 31, 2020 thru an email since the College of Education are advised to be on isolation due to a faculty that is an immediate family member of a COVID-positive patient.



	Set-up of receivable in recognition of her accountability and subsequent derecognition of the lost items will then follow.

	

14. Bank accounts of then External Centers with an aggregate amount of P248,563.08 remained in the respective depository banks despite its closure (external centers), thus depriving the University on a more productive use of the money contrary to the declared policy of the government on sound fiscal management of government resources.



Section 2 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 declared that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguard against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. xxx.”



A schedule (see attached Appendix H) provided by the accounting office on the composition of Cash in Bank –Local Currency, Current Account under 164-2-Special Trust Fund –External Centers as of December 31, 2020 shows inclusion of 21 various bank accounts in the total amount of P248,563.08.



The bank accounts were previously opened by the external centers as their temporary depository account of daily collections and/or local depository account for the cash advances for their operational expenses.  The amounts reflected in the schedule represents the amount granted by the University to open the accounts of the centers.  Except for the centers at Iligan City and Gingoog City which ceased to operate just this last part of CY 2020 and for Baungon; Talisayan and Sugbongcogon which became satellite campuses but were not doing collection functions, the rest of the centers included in the schedule were closed and ceased to operate CY 2019.



The management has initiated the closure of the subject bank accounts but it was learned that the BOR resolution is required by the banks for that purpose.  Information relayed to this office showed that required resolution was already secured during one of the BOR meetings in CY 2020 and its just the actual presentation of the said documents to the banks would finalized the withdrawal however the prevailing pandemic hinders management  from doing so.



The longer  time the subject  money remains idle in these banks the longer it  deprived the University for its use for productive purpose.



We recommended that management hasten the submission of the documents required by the banks to facilitate the efficient withdrawal of the remaining amount back to the coffers of the University and closure of bank accounts.







Management Comments:



Management acknowledges the fact that bank accounts of then External Centers remained in the respective depository banks despite its closure (External Centers).



Board Resolution No. 2051, s. 2020, has been drawn as one of the requirements for closure of the bank accounts of Maragusan, New Bataan and Sto. Tomas ESCs at DBP Tagum. Authorized personnel to process such are just waiting when it is best to travel due to the risks posed by the pandemic since it requires personal appearance. Moreover, a Status of Account/Certification has been received for the accounts of Sugbongcogon and such are for adjustment. We are currently waiting for deposit slips from other External Studies Centers to be forwarded to us and certification from Banks regarding status of accounts because such has been hampered due to the pandemic. Furthermore, we are verifying if there were unrecognized returns particularly with those in prior years thru checking the Bank Reconciliations. 

	

15. Disbursements for  COVID-19 Hazard Pay in December 2020 in the amount P2M were not supported with sufficient and relevant documents contrary to the guidelines set forth in AO 26 – ‘Authorizing the Grant of Hazard Pay to Government Personnel xxx Implementation of an Enhanced Community Quarantine relative to the Covid-19 Outbreak’ and DBM Budget Circular  2020-1 – ‘Guidelines on the Grant of the Covid-19 Hazard Pay’, thus the validity of the transaction could not be ascertained.



AO No. 26 dated March 17, 2020 authorized the grant of Hazard Pay to Government Personnel who physically report for work during the period of implementation of an Enhanced Community Quarantine relative to the COVID-19 outbreak. The relevant provisions of the said AO are stated below, to wit:



WHEREAS, Proclamation No. 929 (s. 2020) declared a State of Calamity in the entire country for a period of six (6) months, imposed an Enhanced Community Quarantine over the entire Luzon effective 17 March 2020 and expiring on 13 April 2020, xxx, in light of the COVID-19 situation;



SECTION 2. Conditions on the Grant of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay. The heads of government agencies may grant the COVID-19 Hazard Pay to their personnel without the need for further approval of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), provided the following conditions are met:



a)	The personnel are occupying regular, contractual or casual positions, or are engaged through COS, JO or other similar schemes;

b)	The personnel have been authorized to physically report for work at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official working hours by the head of agency or office during the period of implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine measures in the area of such office or work station; and

c)	The rate of COVID-19 Hazard Pay shall be based on the number of days an employee physically reports for work xxx.



SECTION 10. Retroactive Application. The grant of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay shall be effective beginning 17 March 2020.

DBM BC 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020 provided the guidelines for the grant of COVID-19 Hazard Pay pursuant to AO No. 26. The said BC basically contained a reiteration of the guidelines and conditions set forth in AO No. 26.

Executive Order No. 83 of the City of Malaybalay placed the same city under Enhanced Community Quarantine for the period March 26, 2020 to April 15, 2020 as recommended by the Malaybalay City IATF for COVID-19.



Examination of vouchers pertaining to the payment of Hazard Pay for employees stationed at BukSU Main showed that the period covered by all related disbursements was from March 17, 2020 to April 30, 2020 whereas the EO placing the City of Malaybalay under ECQ only covered the period March 26, 2020 to April 15, 2020. The supporting documents attached to the DVs included the following:



a)	Executive Order No. 83 of the City of Malaybalay – ‘An Order Placing the City of Malaybalay under Enhanced Community Quarantine as Recommended by the Malaybalay City Inter-Agency Task Force for COVID-19’

b)	EO No. 13 of the Province of Bukidnon – ‘An Order Declaring a General Community Quarantine in the Entire Province of Bukidnon’, dated March 17, 2020.

c)	Resolution No. 01 of the City of Malaybalay – ‘A Resolution Adopting Measures to be Implemented in the City of Malaybalay to prevent the entry and spread and to contain the Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) in the City of Malaybalay’, dated March 13, 2020

d)	EO No. 89 of the City of Malaybalay – ‘An Order Extending the General Community Quarantine Period in the City of Malaybalay to May 31, 2020 and Prescribing Amendatory Guidelines in pursuance thereof’, dated May 14, 2020



It was likewise observed that for Hazard Pay disbursed for employees stationed in various BukSU Satellite Campuses within Bukidnon, the supporting documents attached were the same as those released for employees stationed at BukSU Main Campus, Malaybalay City, e.g. issuances of the City of Malaybalay and the Province of Bukidnon. No ECQ issuances from the Local Government Unit of the Satellite Campuses were attached.



The same has been observed for Satellite Campuses outside Bukidnon wherein the period covered for the grant of Hazard Pay was from March 17, 2020 to April 30, 2020. No supporting documents such as LGU issuances were likewise attached.



See Appendix I for schedule of amounts.



AO No. 26 and DBM BC 2020-1 is clear on the condition that the personnel/worker has been authorized to physically report for work xxx during the implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine measures in the area of such office or work station (emphasis ours)



It was also observed that the payment of the Hazard Pay was recorded as Salaries and Wages for the regular and casual employees.



In view of the abovementioned circumstances, the validity and propriety of the payment of Hazard Pay to employees could not be ascertained specially the days included in the computation which were not covered by pertinent issuances.

We recommended that management:

	

(a) Prepare and submit to this  office a summary of the Hazard Pay disbursed by fund, containing the total amount paid for the period March 17-25, 2020 and April 16-30, 2020;



(b) Submit additional supporting documents showing that the LGUs where each Satellite Campus is located declared an Enhanced Community Quarantine showing the inclusive dates thereof; and



(c) Henceforth, management is encouraged to be more cautious in reviewing all supporting documents and related issuances of disbursements especially those which are not commonly paid out.



Management Comments:



	Management acknowledges the fact that disbursements for COVID-19 Hazard Pay were not supported with sufficient and relevant documents contrary to the guidelines set forth in AO 26 – ‘Authorizing the Grant of Hazard Pay to Government Personnel’.



	However, this is a justification regarding the release of hazard pay to BukSU employees who have rendered services on March 17, 2020-April 30, 2020. The said release was given due to the following:

1)	CHED Memorandum COVID Advisory No 5 dated March 17, 2020 provides that “HEIs should direct all its employees to work from home except for offices which will require a skeletal workforce that will ensure the provision of essential basic services such as the processing of salary, janitorial services to clean and disinfect facilities and offices with security services. HEIs with skeletal workforce must ensure its strict compliance with the precautionary measures directed by DOH and quarantine measures enforced by the DILG and its respective local government”.

2)	Executive Order No. 83 of the City of Malaybalay – An Order Placing the City of Malaybalay under Enhanced Community Quarantine as Recommended by the Malaybalay City Inter-Agency Task Force for COVID-19.

3)	Memorandum No. 047, Series of 2020 – Guidelines on the Implementation of Skeletal Workforce of the Bukidnon State University has identified offices requiring physical presence of staff in the office to ensure delivery of basic services and performance of other vital services with due observance of social/physical distancing policy and other preventive health measures.

4)	A skeletal workforce was established in Satellite Campuses even classroom were utilized by Local Government Units as quarantine facility.

5)	COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, S.2020 Interim Guidelines Governing Contract of Service (COS) and Job Order (JO) Workers in Government for the Duration of the State of Calamity and Community Quarantine Due to the Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) provides that

3.2 COS and JO workers, whose services are engaged by agencies located in Visayas and Mindanao under the General Community Quarantine, may be considered for the following arrangements:

a. Skeletal workforce;

b. Work from home;

c. Compressed work week; and

d. Staggered working hours.

3.5 COS and JO workers who will not be required to report for work due to work suspension and those who are not part of the agency skeletal workforce shall be paid their corresponding salaries/wages during community quarantine period as exception to the “no work, no pay” principle for this occasion only.

6. Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 18, Series of 2020 Amendment to the Revised Interim Guidelines for Alternative Work Arrangements and Support Mechanisms for Workers in the Government during the Period of State of Public Health Emergency due to COVID-19 Pandemic provides that:

	4.0 Support Mechanisms

	Other monetary and forms of incentives as may be allowed by the Office of the President or other authorized agencies or upon approval of the heads of agencies subject to budgeting, accounting and auditing rules and regulations.

7.  That, on March 9, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte issued Proclamation No. 922 s. 2020 declaring a State of Public Health Emergency throughout the country. This was after the Department of Health recorded additional cases of 2019 Novel Coronavirus, including the first case of local transmission in the Philippines;

      8.  That, subsequently, on March 16, 2020, Proclamation No. 929, s.2020 was issued   

by President Rodrigo Duterte placing the entire country under State of Calamity due to COVID-19. This included the declaration of Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) throughout Luzon. Although, emphasis was not made for Visayas and Mindanao, interventions were made by local government units more or less equivalent to the ECQ set-up.  Since at this time, the entire country populace including here in Mindanao were all wary and anxious due to the fear of the virus. Various government agencies including the private sector have sent their employees work from home immediately for fear of contamination of the deadly virus;

9.   That, the University for that matter, guided with the national and local issuances,   

      Issued University Memorandum No. 43, s. 2020 on Emergency Measures due to COVID-19 suspending all classes and sending employees home starting March 16, 2020 and onwards on the same ground. Similarly, in the satellite campuses, faculty  and non-teaching personnel were directed to work from home except for Utility Aide/Watchmen who were asked to remain in their post to secure the campus properties. This despite the imminent danger and fear that they felt at the moment they were physically reporting. It cannot be denied that everyone at that moment was all in great mental and emotional danger, much more to those who were physically reporting to work just to serve the organization. On a side note, most of the government and private organizations in the localities where our satellite campuses are located have sent their employees home considering the need to safeguard their employees from the deadly virus despite the absence of ECQ issuances;



That, at the time of declaration, the mental and emotional danger was very imminent to everyone’s eyes such that various organizations including local government units have issued corresponding issuances to prevent, control and mitigate the spread of the virus without minding whether it is classified as ECQ or GCQ because that same language has not sunk in yet to the local health authorities. However, with the guidance of local authorities we also directed our University employees to work from home.



Considering the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the declaration of national health emergency, the university, through PVP Inc., initiated an online survey to assess the mental health of its employees. Results of the survey showed that 84% of the surveyed employees responded that they are experiencing stress, 57% experienced anxiety, and 66% experienced depression. While they have unstable mental health conditions, they were left with no choice but to continue working even if sudden hazards were top of mind. A grant of hazard pay was given to compensate essential, university frontline workers who faced a significant risk of attending to university processes even during the declaration of community quarantine.



	Wherefore, having articulated with the foregoing conditions and circumstances, it is hereby prayed for that the hazard pay granted to the concerned employees be favorably considered in view of the imminent danger that they faced during the time they were physically reporting to work.



Hazard Pay disbursed are currently being consolidated. We will forward its summary once completed.



Attached herewith is Annex A for the summary of issuances in Satellite Campuses. We have included too, EO No. 83, series of 2020 (ECQ Declaration) and EO No. 85, series of 2020 (ECQ Extension).



Management will adhere to be more cautious in reviewing all supporting documents and related issuances of disbursements especially those new or which are not commonly paid out.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



Section 2 of the DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1 explicitly states that the Covid19 Hazard Pay will only be granted once the conditions are met one of which is “The personnel have been authorized to physically report for work at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official working hours by the head of agency or office during the period of implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine measures in the area of such office or work station.” Compliance on the submission of the requested documents required in the audit recommendation is enjoined for our appropriate audit action.

Gender and Development (GAD) 



During the year, the agency implemented the Gender and Development Plan and Activities which include seminars and workshops on Gender Sensitivity, Gender Awareness, Livelihood and Skills Training, and Contemporary Issues such as the VAWC Law and Early Marriage and Pregnancy, among others.



Joint Circular No. 2004-01 dated August 15, 2001 of the DBM, NEDA and NCFRW, requires the preparation of an Annual Gender and Development Plan that will provide the mechanics for the development of programs, activities and projects to promote gender-responsive governance, protect and fulfill women’s human rights, and promote women’s economic empowerment. The GAD Plan and Budget shall constitute an attribution of at least five percent (5%) of the agency’s total appropriations.



The Office of the Vice-President for Research, Extension and International Affair serve as the GAD Focal Point of the University. A GAD Plan for the current year was formulated and planned activities were funded under the Other Maintenance and Other Expenses and Personal Services.



Audit of GAD funds was confined to the verification of status of accomplishments vis-à-vis the GAD Plan. It was noted that there were several GAD related activities accomplished during the year incurring total attributed expenditures of P36,823,596.06 (Appendix J).



We have encouraged Management to continue to appropriate at least 5% of the total appropriations for GAD activities, with due consideration of cost attributable to regular programs, projects and activities of the University. Further, intensify the implementation of programs, projects and activities to achieve the mandated commitment to pursue women’s empowerment and gender equality.



Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability 



In compliance with Section 32 of the General Appropriations Act of 2020 which requires that “All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities. Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and R.A. No. 7277.”

In consideration of physically challenged students, the University recognized the worth of each and every member of the academic community. It accommodated everyone, including the students with disability and extended help by providing those students with some considerations during their stay in the University, thru the following:

--	Student volunteers are required to assist students with physical disability;

--	Assisted and given priority during their enrollment; 

--	Allowed to transfer their classes in the first floor; and

--	Allowed them to form an association and exercise equal freedom to assembly.



We encouraged the Management to promote more programs and projects for the physically challenged students as they may deem appropriate. We also encouraged Management to participate in any projects and activities conducted by various organizations from local or national level in compliance with Section 32 of the GAA of 2020.



Compliance with Property Insurance Law



The University’s Property Office is properly bonded in compliance with Section 101 of PD 1445. Likewise, Management is compliant with Republic Act No. 656, as amended by PD 245 dated July 13, 1973, which states that “All departments, bureaus, offices, agencies and instrumentalities of the government, including government owned and controlled corporations are directed to insure against insurable risk all property and assets belonging to the government, its agencies and political subdivisions with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS.”



The University secured insurance of its property for the period 2020 to 2021 with the Government Service Insurance System and has likewise agreed to renew the same upon its expiration.



Disaster Risk Reduction and Management 



In compliance with Section 36 of the General Provision of GAA 2020, the University implemented several programs, projects and activities which contributed to the awareness regarding climate change adaptation and mitigation and disaster risk-reduction and preparedness. 

The year 2020 was especially challenging due to the COVID-19 pandemic but the DRRM Unit showed resiliency and continued to implement programs which focused on Preparedness, Prevention & Mitigation, Response, and Rehabilitation & Recovery in relation to the on-going pandemic.



In addition to COVID-19 related programs, the DRRMU likewise conducted activities in the area of volunteerism which focused on the helping the community in various incidents. 



Shown in Appendix K are the quarterly accomplishments which were taken from the 2020 Accomplishment Report of the said office.
