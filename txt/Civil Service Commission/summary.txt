EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)		Introduction



The civil service system in the Philippines was formally established under Public Law No. 5 ("An Act for the Establishment and Maintenance of Our Efficient and Honest Civil Service in the Philippine Island") in 1900 by the Second Philippine Commission. A Civil Service Board was created composed of a Chairman, a Secretary and a Chief Examiner. The Board administered civil service examinations and set standards for appointment in government service. 



It was reorganized into a Bureau in 1905.  The 1935 Philippine Constitution firmly established the merit system as the basis for employment in government. The following years also witnessed the expansion of the Bureau’s jurisdiction to include the national, local and corporate sectors of the government. 



In 1959, Republic Act No. 2260, otherwise known as the Civil Service Law, was enacted. This was the first integral law on the Philippine bureaucracy, superseding the scattered administrative orders relative to government personnel administration issued since 1900. This Act converted the Bureau of Civil Service into the Civil Service Commission (CSC) with department status.



In 1975, Presidential Decree No. 807 (The Civil Service Decree of the Philippines) redefined the role of the Commission as the central personnel agency of government. Its present mandate is derived from Article IX-B of the 1987 Constitution which was given effect through Book V of Executive Order No. 292 (The 1987 Administrative Code). The Code essentially reiterates existing principles and policies in the administration of the bureaucracy and recognizes, for the first time, the right of government employees to self-organization and collective negotiation under the framework of the 1987 Constitution.



At present, the CSC headed by Chairperson Alicia dela Rosa-Bala who was appointed on October 12, 2015.  Assisting the Chairperson in the operation are two Commissioners, namely: Leopoldo Roberto W. Valderosa, Jr., who retired on February 2, 2020 and Atty. Aileen Lourdes A. Lizada. 



As of December 31, 2020, the CSC has total available positions of 1,399 of which 1,173 were filled up by 366 Central Office and 807 regional/field offices personnel.

C)		Scope of Audit



	The audit covered the accounts and operations of the CSC for CY 2020. The audit was conducted to: a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements; b) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; c) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations; and d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.





D)		Auditor’s Opinion on the Financial Statements



A modified opinion was rendered on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the CSC for CY 2020 due to the following accounting errors and deficiencies, the details of which are discussed in Part II of this report and the analysis of their effects on the financial statements are presented in Annex B:



1)	The reliability and accuracy of the year-end balance of the account Cash in Bank-Local Currency Current Account (CIB-LCCA) in the amount of ₱1.042 million is doubtful due to: a) existence of unidentified/unadjusted reconciling items in the amount of ₱2.073 million; b) inclusion of stale checks in the amount of ₱52,217.44; and c) non-reversion of unreleased checks in the amount of ₱343,680.00. (Paragraph No. 1)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the: a) Accountant of CSC RO III to identify and work on the Cash in Bank unreconciled amount of ₱801,829.29 as at December 31, 2020 and effect adjustments in the books by preparing the Journal Entry Voucher/s; b) Accountant of CSC RO V, IX, and XIII to recognize the identified reconciling items – to record direct deposits of ₱664,500 (RO V); reconciling items not yet credited by the bank of ₱47,200.00 (RO IX); and unadjusted reconciling items of ₱559,323.88 (RO XIII) to correct and reconcile the balance of the account; c) Accountant of RO IX to prepare letter request addressed to the LBP Zamboanga Branch that subject collection in the amount of ₱47,200.00 be credited back to the account of CSC Training Fund; d) Accountant of the CSC RO III to prepare the adjusting entries to recognize the cancellation of stale checks of ₱52,217.44; and e)  Cashier of the CSC RO III to submit a Schedule of Unreleased Checks to the Designated Accountant on a regular basis for monitoring and facilitate the reversion of the same to Cash in Bank account at the end of the year in accordance with Section 56 Chapter 19 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs Volume I.



2)	The reliability and accuracy of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts in the total amount of ₱734.939 million as at December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained due to: a) unreconciled difference between the accounting  and property records amounting to ₱75.505 million; b) existence of “Reconciliation SL” balances of ₱88.189 million; c) non-recording of acquired/donated PPEs of at least ₱13 million d) improper recording of the   value of  acquired assets of ₱25.590 million; e) unaccounted/missing properties amounting to P0.702 million; f) inclusion of negative book value of several PPE accounts amounting to ₱267,315.98; g) non-derecognition of disposed properties with carrying amount of ₱154,139.46. (Paragraph No. 4)



We recommended and Management agreed to: a) instruct the Accounting and Property Division of the CSC CO, NCR and concerned ROs – II, III, IV, IX, XI, XIII and BARMM, to reconcile their records, investigate the variances and effect necessary adjustments in both accounting and property records accordingly;  b) require the Accountant of CSC CO and RO XI to prepare a breakdown/list containing the details, such as nature and status of assets lumped as “Reconciling SL”, and effect necessary adjusting entries;  c) create an Appraisal Committee to be responsible in the appraisal of the land and building of CSC NCR to establish their appraised value. Upon appraisal, instruct the Accountant to recognize separately in the books of account the land and building taking into consideration the provision of the allowance for depreciation; d) require the Property Officer of CSC NCR,  ROs III and XI to obtain the necessary documents from the source agencies of properties donated  and use them as basis in recording these assets in the books of accounts; e) direct the Accountant of CSC RO III and IV to retrieve and examine the documents related to the purchase of land and building to determine the value for each property and make the necessary adjustments to correct the balances of the account;  f) require the Property Officer of RO XI to determine the last known locations of the missing items amounting to ₱701,995.70, send demand letters to concerned accountable officers to produce the missing items, otherwise, conduct proper investigation; g) require the Accountant of CSC CO to extensively analyze the negative PPE balances and effect proper adjustments, if warranted; and  h) direct the Accountant of CSC RO III to derecognize from the PPE account the cost of unserviceable properties based on the duly accomplished Inventory and IIRUP, and prepare the necessary adjusting entries thereof.



3)	The reliability and accuracy of Inventory accounts as at December 31, 2020 totaling ₱13.424 million could not be ascertained due to: a) unreconciled difference between the accounting and property records amounting to ₱3.970 million in CO,  NCR, ROs III, IV and X;  b) non-compliance with Perpetual Inventory System in NCR and RO III;  c) incomplete conduct of semi-annual physical count of inventory in ROs III, IV and VII; and d) non-adoption of the weighted average method of costing inventories in RO III. (Paragraph No. 3)



We recommended and Management agreed to: a) instruct the Accountants and Property/Supply Officers of CSC CO, NCR, ROs III, IV and X to reconcile their records, investigate the variances and effect necessary adjustments both in accounting and property records accordingly; b) require the Accountants of CSC NCR and RO III to strictly comply with Section 9 of GAM Vol. I, on the use and application of the Perpetual Inventory System by recording purchases  as Inventory and issuance of supplies as expense;  c) direct the Inventory Committee of CSC ROs III, IV and VII to conduct physical count of inventory every semester with the presence of the Audit Team, and, correspondingly, prepare and submit the RPCI to the Audit Team; and d) require the Accountant of CSC RO III to use the weighted average method of inventory costing as prescribed by Section 6, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I.



4)	The accuracy and reliability of the balance of the Due from NGAs account amounting to ₱78.290 million as at December 31, 2020 is doubtful due to: a) the unreconciled balances of ₱1.101 million between the CSC CO books and the inter-agency reciprocal account maintained by the PS-DBM; and b) long outstanding balance in the books of CSC RO IV for procurements with PS DBM amounting to ₱0.881 million. (Paragraph No. 2)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the: a) Property Officer and the Accountant of CSC-CO to coordinate with the PS-DBM to reconcile their records to account for the difference  of ₱1,101,826.48 as well as the non-moving/dormant balances of ₱647,124.95 and to instruct the Supply/Property Officer of CSC RO IV to coordinate regularly with the Procurement Services and reconcile the balance between Due from NGAs- PS-DBM  as against Due to NGAs of the PS-DBM to determine the actual balance and make the necessary adjustments, if any; and b) Accountant of RO IV to make the necessary adjustment based on the reconciliation made with the PS-DBM to reflect the correct balance of Due from NGAs in the financial statement.











5)	The CY 2019 corresponding figures presented in the CY 2020 financial statements were not restated to reflect prior year errors and adjustments, which is not compliant with existing provisions of the GAM. (Paragraph No. 5)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Service to properly present the prior period corrections/adjustments by restating prior year balances of affected accounts shown as corresponding figures for the current year financial statements in compliance with the requirements of Section 42 (b) and 43, Chapter 19 of the GAM Volume I.
