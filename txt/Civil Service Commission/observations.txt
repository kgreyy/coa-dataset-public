FINANCIAL ISSUES





Doubtful Cash in Bank balances 



1)	The reliability and accuracy of the year-end balance of the account Cash in Bank-Local Currency Current Account (CIB-LCCA) in the amount of ₱1.042 billion is doubtful due to: a) existence of unidentified/unadjusted reconciling items in the amount of ₱2.073 million; b) inclusion of stale checks in the amount of ₱52,217.44; and c) non-reversion of unreleased checks in the amount of ₱343,680.00. 



a.       Existence of unidentified/unadjusted reconciling items



	1)	Section 74 of P.D. No. 1445 prescribes that, “At the close of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition of the agency account standing on their books. The head of the agency shall see to it that reconciliations are made between the balance shown in the reports and the balance found in the books of the agency.”



	2)	Similarly, Section 3, Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I, states that, “The Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) shall be prepared in order to a) check correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s/entity’s records; b) serve as a deterrent to fraud, and c) enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or credits recognized by the bank or agency/entity but not yet known to the agency/entity or bank.”



	3)	Review and analysis of Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRSs) of the CSC Regional Offices (ROs) III, V, IX, and XIII revealed that there were existing reconciling items amounting to ₱2,072,893.17 that remain unadjusted as at December 31, 2020, summarized in Table No. 1.

	4)	Reconciling items reflected in the Monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements of CSC RO III in the total amount of ₱801,829.29 remain unadjusted for more than a year. 



	5)	The existence of the above unadjusted reconciling items as reported in the BRSs of the CSC RO III was due to inaccurate/unreliable manual posting made by the former Accountant.  



	6)	Further, inquiry from the designated Accountant disclosed that the non-adjustment of the reconciling items was due to the non-preparation/submission of prior years’ Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRSs) by the former Accountant.



	7)	The bank reconciliation statements of CSC RO V revealed that direct deposits made by various examinees to the different branches of the LBP amounting to ₱664,540.00 were not yet taken up in the CSC books of accounts. Most of the deposits were payment for Seminar Fees, Training Fees, Examination Fees and Clearance, Certification Fees and other receipts. Out of the total deposits, ₱377,950.00 or 56.87 percent pertained to the unrecorded deposits made in prior years.



	8)	According to the Acting Accountant of CSC RO V, the deposits were not yet recognized in the books due to the absence of the necessary supporting documents such as the official receipts issued to the depositors and the deposit slips which are the basis for recording the transactions. 



	9)	As a result, the unrecorded deposits continue to accumulate as reconciling items in the bank reconciliation statements. 



	10)	In CSC RO IX, the reconciling item of ₱47,200.00 pertained to 2017 deposit which was not yet credited by the bank.



	11)	Review of CY 2017 October Bank Statement showed that the subject collection was duly credited by the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) to Current Account No. 0192- 0072-08 (Training Fund). However, in November of the same year, a bank debit memo was issued by the bank for the check deposit of ₱47,200.00.  Details are as follows:

	12)	The Accountant disclosed that a letter-inquiry concerning the above-mentioned bank debit memo was already sent to the LBP. Per verbal confirmation in November 2017, the above-mentioned local check was returned by the bank but was later on cleared in LBP Main Branch – Zamboanga City. Despite the clearing of the check, the subject deposit   has yet to be credited back to the account of CSC Training Fund.



	13)	Reconciling items of CSC RO XIII in the total amount ₱559,323.88, aged 1 year to over 10 years, remain unadjusted in the books.  These reconciling items were undetermined deposits.



	14)	Interview with the Accountant disclosed these undetermined deposits were made thru List of Due and Demandable Accounts Payable-Advice to Debit Account (LDDAP-ADA) by other government agencies in payment of registration fees for trainings.  Similarly, under the Trust Receipts undetermined deposits pertained to deposits made into the account without prior notice to the Commission; hence, such deposits were made known only during the conduct of monthly bank reconciliation. 



	15)	Due to the presence of the unadjusted reconciling items, the accuracy and reliability of the balance of Cash in Bank-Local Currency Current Account could not be ascertained thus, rendering the correctness of the account balance doubtful and further affecting the fairness of presentation of the CIB-LCCA account in the Statement of Financial Position at year-end.



b.   Inclusion of Stale Checks



	16)	Treasury Circular No. 03-2017 dated October 20, 2017 states that MDS checks to be issued starting January 2, 2018 shall already indicate “VALID FOR THREE MONTHS FROM DATE OF ISSUE”. The Circular also emphasizes the reduction in the expiry period of MDS Check from six months to three months from date of issue to provide a more effective way of managing cash and minimize the long floating of outstanding checks. 



	17)	Review and analysis of BRS of CSC RO III revealed the existence of 12 stale checks amounting to ₱52,217.44 in the List of Outstanding Checks that remain unadjusted in the books as at December 31, 2020. 



	18)	Notwithstanding the status of above-mentioned checks, the same were not cancelled and reverted back to Cash in Bank account.



c.     Non-reversion of unreleased checks 



	19)	Section 56, Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAS, Volume I states that, All unreleased checks at the end of the year shall be reverted back to the cash accounts. A JEV shall be prepared to recognize the restoration of the cash equivalent to the unreleased checks and the recognition of the appropriate liability/payable account. 



	20)	In CSC RO III, check in the amount of ₱343,680.00 remain unreleased to payee as at December 31, 2020. Similar with stale checks, these were not reverted back to Cash in Bank account as at year-end.



	21)	It was noted that a monthly Schedule of Unreleased Checks is not being prepared and submitted by the Cashier to the Accounting Division. The Schedule is an important document showing the list of checks that are stale, voided or unclaimed by the payees. This provides the Accounting Division with information regarding the status of checks that are drawn by the Agency. As provided, any unreleased and stale checks as of year-end should be reverted back to the cash accounts. 



	22)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the:



a)	Accountant of CSC RO III to identify and work on the Cash in Bank unreconciled amount of ₱801,829.29 as at December 31, 2020 and effect adjustments in the books by preparing the Journal Entry Voucher/s;



b)	Accountant of CSC ROs V, IX, and XIII to recognize the identified reconciling items – to record direct deposits of ₱664,500 (RO V);  reconciling items not yet credited by the bank of ₱47,200.00 (RO IX); and unadjusted reconciling items of ₱559,323.88 (RO XIII) to correct and reconcile the balance of the account; 



c)	Accountant of CSC RO IX to prepare letter request addressed to the LBP Zamboanga Branch that subject collection in the amount of ₱47,200.00 be credited back to the account of CSC Training Fund;



d)	Accountant of the CSC RO III to prepare the adjusting entries to recognize the cancellation of stale checks of ₱52,217.44; and



e)	Cashier of the CSC RO III to submit a Schedule of Unreleased Checks to the designated Accountant on a regular basis for monitoring and facilitate the reversion of the same to Cash in Bank account at the end of the year in accordance with Section 56 Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs Volume I.



	23)	The Management of CSC RO IX commented that an investigation on the events surrounding the transaction will be conducted, to confirm whether the check for the amount ₱47,200.00 was an NSF check and if the amount is still a receivable or otherwise, in order to eliminate the recurrence of the bank reconciling item. The agency is confident that the transaction is traceable and its elimination as bank reconciling item can be done in the CY 2021.



	24)	Likewise, Management of CSC RO XIII also commented that mostly, all of the deposits under Training Fund were thru Credit Memos (CM).  These are the List of Due and Demandable Accounts Payable-Advice to Debit Account (LDDAP-ADA) issued by various government agencies for payments from client agencies and individuals for registration fees for trainings attended.  Management also explained that they made an inquiry with the LBP on how they can trace the unknown deposits, but the bank gave them Branch Codes only and not the names of depositors or agencies, thus they cannot identify and verify the said deposits.



	25)	Nevertheless, Management of CSC RO XIII assured the Audit Team of the immediate taking up/recording of all identified reconciling items in the books of accounts to ensure the correct balance of the CIB-LCCA and to request bank credit memos from the Landbank of the Philippines.





Doubtful validity of the account Due from NGAs 

 

2)	The accuracy and reliability of the balance of the Due from NGAs account amounting to ₱78.290 million as at December 31, 2020 is doubtful due to: a) the unreconciled balance of ₱1.101 million between the CSC CO books and the inter-agency reciprocal account maintained by the PS-DBM; and b) long outstanding balance in the books of CSC RO IV for procurements with PS DBM amounting to ₱0.881 million. 



		a)	 Unreconciled Balance of the account Due from NGAs-PS DBM



	1)	The account Due from NGAS has a year- end balance of ₱78,289,695.16, of which ₱6,202,976.78 pertained to accounts with the Procurement Service-Department of Budget and Management of CSC CO and RO IV for the purchase of various office supplies and materials. 



	2)	Section 7, Chapter 19 of the GAM, Volume I provides among others that financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, or other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, and revenue, and expenses set out in International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs).



	3)	The account Due from NGAs is an inter-agency receivables account which has a corresponding reciprocal account in the books of the PS-DBM under a payable account. The receivable is debited to record the amount advanced for the account of the PS-DBM supported by a duly approved Agency Purchase Request (APR). The same is credited upon receipt of deliveries evidenced by a Delivery Receipt (DR) acknowledged by the Property Officer.



	4)	Review of the CSC-CO’s accounting records disclosed that the Due from NGAs – PS-DBM account showed a balance of ₱5,321,481.10 as at December 31, 2020, detailed as follows:



		Table No. 3- Breakdown  PS-DBM Balance

		

		General Fund (GF)

		Trust Receipts

		Training Funds (TF)

		₱4,674,356.15 

		₱532,921.37

		₱114,203.58 

	₱5,321,481.10 



	5)	However, the Statement of Account of the PS-DBM showed a balance of ₱4,219,654.62 as at December 31, 2020. Comparison of the balances disclosed a variance between the accounting records of CSC-CO and PS-DBM amounting to ₱1,101,826.48.



	6)	It was also noted that the account includes non-moving/dormant balances from Fiscal Autonomy Trust Receipts (FATR) and Training Fund (TF) books in the total amount of ₱647,124.95 which were carried forward for less than two years  as shown below:

	8)	There was no reconciliation made between the books of the CSC – CO and of the PS-DBM for the said inter-agency accounts. Hence, the accuracy and reliability of the account balance of Due from NGAs-PS-DBM could not be established.

b.       Long outstanding balance



	9)	Reconciliation between the CSC RO IV and the PS-DBM for the procurement of supplies and materials was not conducted since 2015 up to present thus, resulting in long outstanding balance in the books amounting to ₱881,495.68.  



	10)	Verification of the General Ledger balance showed that ₱869,357.68 pertained to the beginning balances for the three funds namely: Trust, Training, and General Fund which were set up on June 30, 2015, while the ₱12,138.00 pertained to the procurement of supplies in CYs 2016 and 2017 that remain undelivered. The previous Accountant explained that transactions referring to the beginning balances can no longer be identified due to a glitch out of the e-NGAS program and the files retrieved started from June 2015 only. Details of the GL balances are shown below:

	11)	The Management of CSC RO IV explained that on January 13, 2021, the Supply Officer inquired for an update on the remaining balance with PS-DBM and the said supplies were already delivered on March 8, 2021. Instructions were already given to the Accountant to make the necessary adjusting entries for the account Due from NGAs-PS-DBM. The Accountant will also coordinate with COA for the request to write-off the said long outstanding receivables. 



	12)	Had a regular reconciliation been done by CSC RO IV with the PS-DBM to thresh out discrepancy in the account balances, the long outstanding receivable of ₱881,495.68 should have not been incurred and reflected in the financial statements. 



	13)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the:



a)	Property Officer and the Accountant of CSC-CO to coordinate with the PS-DBM to reconcile their records to account for the difference  of ₱1,101,826.48 as well as the non-moving/dormant balances of ₱647,124.95 and to instruct the Supply/Property Officer of CSC RO IV to coordinate regularly with the Procurement Services and reconcile the balance between Due from NGAs- PS-DBM  as against Due to NGAs of the PS-DBM to determine the actual balance and make the necessary adjustments, if any; and



b)	Accountant of RO IV to make the necessary adjustment based on the reconciliation made with the PS-DBM to reflect the correct balance of Due from NGAs in the financial statement.





Unreliable balance of Inventory accounts



3)	The reliability and accuracy of Inventory accounts as at December 31, 2020 totaling ₱13.424 million could not be ascertained due to: a) unreconciled difference between the accounting and property records amounting to ₱3.970 million in Central Office,  NCR, ROs III, IV and X; b) non-compliance with Perpetual Inventory System in NCR and RO III; c) incomplete conduct of semi-annual physical count of inventory in ROs III, IV and VII; and d) non-adoption of the weighted average method of costing inventories in RO III.



	a)	Unreconciled difference between the accounting and property records amounting to ₱3.970 million



	1)	Instructions of Appendix 66 of the GAM, Volume II states that the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) is a form used to report the physical count of inventory items by type such as Office Supplies Inventory; Accountable Forms Inventory; Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Inventory; Food Supplies Inventory, etc. which are owned by the agency/entity. It shall be prepared semi-annually by the Inventory Committee and by fund cluster.



	2)	In addition, the same instructions states that report shall be reconciled with the Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs) and Stock Cards (SCs) maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit, and Property and/or Supply Division/Unit, respectively. Any discrepancy shall be verified and/or adjusted accordingly.



	3)	Comparison between the accounting records and the RPCI as at December 31, 2020 for Central Office, NCR and ROs III, IV and X showed a discrepancy in the total amount of ₱3,969,599.94. The submitted RPCI has not been reconciled with the accounting records, contrary to aforementioned instructions from GAM. Details are shown in Table No. 7.

	4)	Results of inquiry showed that the common reason for differences in various CSC Offices was the inability to perform regular reconciliation of balances between the accounting and property records resulting in the accumulation of unreconciled amounts.



	5)	In CSC-CO, there were unrecorded Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMIs) in the General Ledger amounting to ₱406,241.78 and non-inclusion of ending inventory balance of Accountable Forms in the RPCI in the amount of ₱450,580.00.



	6)	While in RO III, the variance was caused by the non-issuance of RSMIs as the Property Officer prepared Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) instead, which did not indicate the value of issued items.



	b)	Non-compliance with Perpetual Inventory System



	7)	Section 9, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I states that supplies and materials purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running total for the cost of goods sold in each period. 



	8)	In addition, Section 17 (d), of the same Manual states that a Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) shall be used by the end-user to request issue of supplies and materials that are carried on stock. It is also used by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit to indicate availability or non-availability of items requisitioned and/or to record issues of item/s requisitioned.



	9)	Finally, Section 17 (g), of the same Manual states that a Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) (Appendix 64) shall be prepared by the Property and/or Supply Custodian based on the RIS and shall be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the JEV to record the supplies and materials issued.



	10)	Accounting records of CSC NCR and RO III revealed that purchases of various inventories amounting to ₱3,896,218.54 were booked as outright expenses instead of coursing through an inventory account. Details were as follows:

₱785,762.65

₱3,896,218.54



	11)	For CSC RO III, most of the deliveries were immediately issued to the requisitioning office/end user and directly charged to the appropriate expense accounts. Hence, the drawing of journal entry voucher to record the expenses was made without the RSMI, supported by duly approved and received RIS for supplies and materials, and Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) for semi-expendable inventory of supplies, which should have been the basis for the recognition of said expenses.



	12)	The above practices are inconsistent with Sections 9 and 17, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I as cited above.



	c)	Incomplete semi-annual physical count of inventory



	13)	Section, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I states that physical count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship.



	14)	Audit of CSC ROs III and IV revealed that the required physical count of inventory was only conducted once a year hence, not compliant with the required semi-annual physical count to check the integrity of property custodianship and avoid the incurrence of material discrepancies between the balances in the Accounting and Property records.



	15)	Meanwhile, CSC RO VII failed to submit RPCI to the audit team which prevented the verification of inventory balances at year-end.



	d)	Non-adoption of the weighted average method of computation in recording the issuances of inventories



	16)	Section 6, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I states that the weighted average method shall be used for costing inventories. This method calls for the re-calculation of the average cost of all items in stock after every purchase. 



	17)	Audit of CSC RO III showed that the agency used the first-in first-out (FIFO) method in costing its inventories instead of the required weighted average method which is not in accordance with the foregoing provision.



	18)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	Instruct the Accountants and Property/Supply Officers of CSC CO, NCR, ROs III, IV and X to reconcile their records, investigate the variances and effect necessary adjustments both in accounting and property records accordingly;



b)	Require the Accountants of CSC NCR and RO III to strictly comply with Section 9 of GAM Vol. I, on the use and application of the Perpetual Inventory System by recording purchases  as Inventory and issuance of supplies as expense;  



c)	Direct the Inventory Committee of CSC ROs III, IV and VII to conduct physical count of inventory every semester with the presence of the Audit Team, and, correspondingly, prepare and submit the RPCI to the Audit Team; and



d)	Require the Accountant of CSC RO III to use the weighted average method of inventory costing as prescribed by Section 6, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I.





Unreliable and inaccurate balance of PPE accounts



4)	The reliability and accuracy of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts in the total amount of ₱734.939 million as at December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained due to: a) unreconciled difference between the accounting  and property records amounting to ₱75.505 million; b) existence of “Reconciliation SL” balances of ₱88.189 million; c) non-recording of acquired/donated PPEs of at least ₱13 million d) improper recording of the   value of  acquired assets of ₱25.590 million; e) unaccounted/missing properties amounting to ₱0.702 million; f) inclusion of negative book value of several PPE accounts amounting to ₱267,315.98; g) non-derecognition of disposed properties with carrying amount of ₱154,139.46.



							a)	Unreconciled difference between the accounting and property records amounting to ₱75.505 million



	1)	Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I provides that the entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented in the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 71) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording.

	2)	Comparison between the accounting records and the RPCPPE as at December 31, 2020 submitted by the Inventory Team of CSC-CO and all RO Offices showed a total difference of ₱75,505,038.58. The submitted RPCPPE has not been reconciled with the accounting records, contrary to Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I. Details as follows:

	3)	Some of the identified reconciling items which form part of the unreconciled difference as shown in Table No. 11 were the following:

 

			a)	In the CSC CO, the identified reconciling items were as follows: 

 

--	75 items have no indicated acquisition cost in the RPCPPE;



--	114 unlocated properties amounting to ₱6,080,956.30; and

	

--	Motor vehicles transferred to and recognized in the books of the RO Offices totaling ₱3,682,000.00 were still recorded in the books of CSC CO.



			b)	In CSC NCR, Semi-expendable items below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 totaling ₱2,397,223.51 were included in the RPCPPE.



			c)	196 line items have no indicated acquisition cost in the RPCPPE.



			d)	Some PPE items in the CSC RO II amounting to ₱172,177.28 were not recorded in the books but included in the RPCPPE.



			e)	In CSC RO III, various PPE accounts were recorded in the accounting PPELCs, but not reflected in the RPCPPE, and vice versa. Further verification showed that PPELCs were not kept updated by the Accounting Unit and are incomplete. Likewise, records in the Supply Unit showed that the Property Cards (PCs) for all PPEs, were not prepared and maintained.



			f)	In CSC RO IV, the PPE variance was the result of the non-reconciliation between the records of the Supply Officer and the Accounting Unit since the Accounting Unit did not prepare the required PPELCs and the Property Cards were not updated. 

 

			g)	Comparison of the PPE ledgers and RPCPPE of CSC RO IX showed that Furniture and Fixtures amounting to ₱1,490,820.67 were not in the possession of the agency. 



			h)	In CSC RO XI, no reconciliation between the property and accounting records was undertaken yet to clear the discrepancies.



			i)	In CSC RO XIII, equipment listed in the inventory report were not recognized in the PPE Ledger Card (PPELC) amounting to ₱222,522.00 and there is also equipment that were listed in the PPELC but not included in the inventory report amounting to ₱64,690.00.  Moreover, disposed equipment of ₱17,000.00 was not derecognized in the books.  Also, the dropping of the motor vehicle as unserviceable equipment in the amount of ₱535,598.64 was recognized in the books but not in the inventory report.  It was also noted that there is a difference in the acquisition cost of ₱78,080.00 of six units of ICT Equipment listed in the PPELC and inventory report.



			j)	While in BARMM, Property Officer disclosed that no reconciliation was made between the books maintained by Accounting and Property Unit.

          

	a)	Existence of “Reconciliation SL” balances amounting to ₱88.189 million



	4)	Section 6.3.2 of COA Circular No. 2020-006 states that the Accounting Unit shall take up necessary accounting entries to write-off/drop from the books of accounts the remaining balances of amounts lumped under the “Unreconciled SL”, “Reconciled SL” for PPEs, and the like which were created to facilitate the conversion of accounts from the Old Government Accounting System to the New Government Accounting System (NGAS) and/or from the manual accounting system to the Electronic New Government Accounting System (eNGAS).



	5)	In the CSC Central Office and CSC RO XI, there were PPE accounts with unidentified items in the total amount of ₱88,188,893.87 that were recorded/included in a subsidiary ledger labeled as “Reconciling SL”.  Details were as follows:

	b)	Non-recording of acquired/donated PPEs of at least ₱13 million 



	6)	Section 11 of Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume 1 states that PPE acquired through a non-exchange transaction, such as donation, presidential proclamation, taxes, transfers and grants, its cost shall be measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition. However, this does not constitute revaluation. If the fair value cannot be determined, the asset shall be recorded at a nominal value (the value that is stated on currency or face value).



	7)	Further, Sections 15, Chapter 10 of the same Manual provides for the inter-agency transfer of the PPE which states transfer from one government entity to another shall be recognized by the recipient entity at net carrying value. The transferor shall derecognize the PPE account upon transfer.



	8)	Results of audit in several three CSC ROs showed that acquired/donated properties with an aggregate amount of at least ₱13,000,000.00 were not recognized in the books as at December 31, 2020. Details of which were as follows:

	9)	Records show that the acquisition by CSC NCR of a parcel of land measuring more or less 800 square meters with an improvement of 6-1/4 storey of concrete building in the total amount of ₱13,000,000.00 was not recognized in the books.



	10)	Interview with Supervising Human Resource Specialist disclosed that Management is now in the process of consulting the local appraiser/assessor to establish the correct valuation of the land and building before they recognize them in the books.



	11)	Inventory taking conducted in CSC RO III   revealed that 25 property items donated by various Local Government Units in CYs 2015-2017 were not included in the CY 2020 Inventory Report.  (See Appendix A).



	12)	RPCPPE of CSC RO XI as at December 31, 2020 disclosed two air-conditioning units marked as “Donated” have no corresponding cost and no other available details aside from the description of the items.  Details are shown in Table No. 12.

	13)	The Accounting Units from both ROs failed to recognize the properties due to absence of documents to serve as basis in their recognition. 



	c)	Improper recording of the value of  acquired assets -₱25.590 million 



	14)	In GAM, Volume III the account Land is defined as the account used to recognize the cost incurred in the purchase/reclamation or fair value if acquired through donation or transfers without cost of land. 



	15)	In the same manual, the account Buildings is defined as the account used to recognize the cost incurred in the purchase or construction or fair value, if acquired through donation or transfers without cost, of buildings, such as: office buildings, research/convention/training centers, agricultural laboratories, warehouses, cold storages and the like, for use in government operations.  



	16)	The value of the building and the land where the CSC RO IV is situated was combined into an aggregate amount of ₱17,100,013.60 and was recognized under the account Buildings.  As such the value of the land was not separately recognized. It overstated also the recognition of the impairment of the building due to inaccurate base value. 



	17)	Annex Building in CSC RO III together with the procured furniture and fixtures in the total amount of ₱8,490,191.52 were both recognized under the Buildings account instead of recognizing them to their proper accounts such as: Buildings account of ₱7,397,084.52; Office Equipment account of ₱434,304.00; Furniture and Fixtures account of ₱209,950.00; and Semi-Expendable-Furniture and Fixtures account of ₱448,853.00.  Such condition resulted in the overstatement of ₱1,093,107.00 in the Buildings account and understatement of the remaining aforementioned PPE accounts by the same amounts. (See Appendix B)



	d)	Unaccounted/missing properties amounting to ₱0.702 million



	18)	Section 2 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 or the State Audit Code of the Philippines states that it is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.



	19)	In CSC RO XI, validation was made of the list of unaccounted properties of ₱921,735.70 noted in CY 2019.  In CY 2020, the Property Officer was able to locate certain properties  costing ₱219,740.00 which were inspected by the Audit Team  leaving a balance of ₱701,995.70, broken down as follows:

	20)	The properties worth ₱321,745.70 pertained to items included in the RPCPPE but were not found during the actual inspection conducted by the Audit Team. (See Appendix C)



	21)	While the properties valued at ₱380,250.00 pertained to items removed from the RPCPPE as at December 31, 2020 by Inventory Committee due to unknown whereabouts or status during the physical inventory taking. (See Appendix D)



	e)	Inclusion of negative book value of several PPE accounts amounting to ₱267,315.98



	22)	Subsidiary ledgers of CSC Central Office disclosed PPE with abnormal balances either with negative or zero acquisition costs that resulted in negative book value totaling ₱267,315.98. Details as follows:

	23)	Results of inquiry revealed that transfer of property to Regional Offices were booked twice, causing the net book values of PPEs to be negative. Further verification disclosed that items already disposed were provided automatically with depreciation expense by the e-NGAS, resulting in items having accumulated depreciation but no acquisition costs.



	f)	Non-derecognition of disposed properties with carrying amount ₱154,139.46



	24)	Section 39, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume 1 states that the cost of the PPE together with the related accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss shall be removed from the accounts.  The carrying amount of an item of PPE shall be derecognized on disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected from its use or disposal.



	25)	Disposed properties of CSC RO III were not derecognized in the books; hence, the following accounts were overstated in the total amount of ₱154,139.46.

	26)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	Instruct the Accounting and Property Division of the CSC CO, NCR and concerned ROs – II, III, IV, IX, XI, XIII and BARMM, to reconcile their records, investigate the variances and effect necessary adjustments in both accounting and property records accordingly;



b)	Require the Accountant of CSC Central Office and RO XI to prepare a breakdown/list containing the details, such as nature and status of assets lumped as “Reconciling SL”, and effect necessary adjusting entries;



c)	Create an Appraisal Committee to be responsible in the appraisal of the land and building of CSC NCR to establish their appraised value. Upon appraisal, instruct the Accountant to recognize separately in the books of account the land and building taking into consideration the provision of the allowance for depreciation;



d)	Require the Property Officer of CSC NCR,  ROs III and XI to obtain the necessary documents from the source agencies of properties donated  and use them as basis in recording these assets in the books of accounts;



e)	Direct  the Accountant of CSC RO III and IV to retrieve and examine the documents related to the purchase of land and building to determine the value for each property and make the necessary adjustments to correct the balances of the account; 



f)	Require the Property Officer of RO XI to determine the last known locations of the missing items amounting to ₱701,995.70, send demand letters to concerned accountable officers to produce the missing items, otherwise, conduct proper investigation;



g)	Require the Accountant of CSC CO to extensively analyze the negative PPE balances and effect proper adjustments, if warranted; and 



h)	Direct the Accountant of CSC RO III to derecognize from the PPE account the cost of unserviceable properties based on the duly accomplished Inventory and IIRUP, and prepare the necessary adjusting entries thereof.

	

	27)	Adjusting/Correcting entries have already been made for some PPE items. Reconciliation by the Team of GSD and Accounting- Office of the Financial and Asset Management (OFAM) of other PPE items is on-going.

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	OTHER FINANCIAL ISSUES



  CY 2019 various accounts not restated



5)	The CY 2019 corresponding figures presented in the CY 2020 financial statements were not restated to reflect prior year errors and adjustments, which is not compliant with existing provisions of the GAM.



	1)	Sections 42 (b) and 43, Chapter 19 of the GAM Volume I, state that:



	An entity shall correct material prior period errors retrospectively in the first set of financial statements authorized for issue after their discovery by:



--	Restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in which the error occurred; or



--	If the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating the opening balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for the earliest prior period presented.  (Par. 47, IPSAS 3)



	2)	Section 43 thereof sets the limitations of retrospective restatement of prior period errors as follows:



a)	A prior period error shall be corrected by retrospective restatement, except to the extent that it is impracticable to determine either the period- specific effects or the cumulative effect of the error. (Par. 48, IPSAS 3)



b)	When it is impracticable to determine the period-specific effects of an error on comparative information for one or more prior periods presented, the entity shall restate the opening balances of assets, liabilities, and net assets/equity for the earliest period for which retrospective restatement is practicable (which may be the current period).  (Par. 49, IPSAS 3)



c)	When it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect, at the beginning of the current period, of an error on all prior periods, the entity shall restate the comparative information to correct the error prospectively from the earliest date practicable.  (Par. 50, IPSAS 3)



	3)	Verification of records disclosed that the balances for CY 2019 of various accounts presented as corresponding figures in the CY 2020 financial statements were not restated thus, balances of these accounts affected by prior period corrections/adjustments were not fairly presented in the financial statements.



	4)	The nature of the adjustments that had effects for the prior year are presented in Table No. 16 as reflected in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity.

	6)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Service to properly present the prior period corrections/adjustments by restating prior year balances of affected accounts shown as corresponding figures for the current year financial statements in compliance with the requirements of Section 42 (b) and 43, Chapter 19 of the GAM Volume I.



	7)	The OFAM of the CSC CO, in coordination with the Regional Offices Accountants, had revised the presentation of the prior period corrections/adjustments by restating the prior year’s balances of the affected accounts in compliance with the requirements of Section 42 (b) and 43, Chapter 19 of the GAM Volume 1.

	

	

	Unreliable balance of Cash-Collecting Officer account

	

6)	Lack of internal control in the   issuance of official receipts (ORs), improper completion of ORs, as well as absence of turnover of accountabilities pose possible risk of loss or misuse of government resources.



		a)	Issuance of Official Receipts by unauthorized personnel



	1)	Section 64 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 or the State Audit Code of the Philippines states that the head of an agency may designate such number of collecting officers or agents may be deemed necessary. They shall render reports of their collections, under the regulations of the Commission, to be submitted promptly to the auditor concerned who shall conduct the necessary examination and audit within thirty days from receipt thereof.



	2)	Likewise, Section No. 101 of the same P.D. provides guidelines on bond requirement, such as:



1)	 Every officer of any government agency whose duties permit or require the possession or custody of government funds or property shall be accountable therefor and for the safekeeping thereof in conformity with law.



2)	Every accountable officer shall be properly bonded in accordance with law.



	3)	Also, as expressly provided in Item 7.2 (2) of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2017 that Contract of service and job order workers should not, in any case, be made to perform functions which are part of the job description of the agency’s existing regular employees.



	4)	Collections amounting to ₱1,080,580.12 in CSC RO IV were being exposed to risk of possible loss and misappropriation due to issuance of official receipts by unauthorized personnel other than the designated and bonded Cashier/Collecting Officer, contrary to the provisions of Sections No. 64 and 101 of PD 1445 and Item 7.2 of the CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2017.



	5)	Review of the Report of Collections and Deposits (RCD)  including the ORs from January to September 2020 (reports submitted were up to September 2020 only) showed that the designated Cashier/Collecting Officer was not the only person who has access to the collections and issuances of ORs for CSC RO IV. Validation of signatures in the ORs, as well as inquiry from Management confirmed that, eight other personnel acted as Collecting Officers when the Acting Cashier/Collecting Officer is not available.  Details of the collections are shown below:

	6)	Of the above-mentioned employees, only Employee 1 and Employee 8 were bonded for the position of Supply Officer and OIC-Administrative Officer, respectively. However, since the Cashier/Collecting Officer is under the direct supervision of the Administrative Officer, performing the duties of collecting fees and issuance of ORs could affect the existence of check and balance in the internal control process of the CSC RO IV.



	7)	Meanwhile, Employee 4 and Employee 5 were both Contract of Service (COS) workers and obtain regular positions only on June 1 and October 1, 2020, respectively. However, prior to their regularization, they already have access to the collections and issuance of ORs which is a clear violation of Item 7.2 of the CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2017. The collection of fees and issuance of receipts are exclusively within the function of the Collecting Officer holding a regular position. Thus, performance of such should not be delegated to any contract of service and/or job order (JO) worker due to lack of employer-employee relationship for which he/she could not be held liable for any loss or misappropriations due to absence of accountability.



	8)	The remaining four employees although they  have permanent status, were not designated as Collecting Officers thru the issuance of an Office Order and were not be bonded as required under Section 101 of P.D. No. 1445.



	9)	Management explained that all collections received by the non-designated personnel were accounted for, secured, and accordingly deposited in the authorized government depository bank.



	10)	Bonded alternate Collecting Officers of CSC RO IV, who are already stationed in the RO will be designated to take charge of the cashiering duty whenever the Cashier is making the deposits or on a Work from Home (WFH) arrangement due to the present pandemic.



	11)	Further, Management explained that they already plotted the schedules of the primary cashiers, and bonded the first and second alternate collecting officers in order to prevent the recurrence of the said audit observations.



	12)	Management assured that no COS or JO personnel of CSC RO IV shall be made to perform said duties.



		b)	Improper completion of Official Receipts (ORs) or not properly filled out



	13)	Failure to ensure the accuracy and completeness of data of CSC RO IV to include proper procedures in issuing Official Receipt (OR) have reduced the operational efficiency in the collection process of the agency, in violation of sound internal control policy pursuant to Section 123 and 124 of PD 1445.



	14)	Section 123 of PD 1445 defines internal control as the plan of organization and all the coordinate methods and measures adopted within an organization or agency to safeguard its assets, check the accuracy and reliability of its accounting data, and encourage adherence to prescribed managerial policies.



	15)	While Section 124 discusses its installation which should be the direct responsibility of the agency head to install, implement, and monitor a sound system of internal control.



	16)	In the post audit of Report of Collection and Deposits (RCD) of CSC RO IV for the period January 7 to 15, 2020, the following deficiencies in the issuance of ORs were noted and presented in Table No. 19.

	17)	The ORs must be properly filled out and must bear information necessary to identify the payor and account for the government funds received. Complete information on the face of the OR serves the purpose of a good audit trail. 



	18)	Management explained that the Accountable Officer is new in her position as a Special Collecting Officer such that, she is not aware of the importance of supplying the pertinent information in the ORs to satisfactorily establish accountability.



		c)	Lack of proper turnover of accountabilities



	19)	Proper turnover of accountabilities between the outgoing and incoming Accountable Officers (AO) of CSC RO IV was not performed, contrary to the provision of Sections 77 and 80 of P.D. No. 1445 thus, resulting in the difficulty of determining the cash and property accountabilities of the outgoing AO.



	20)	Section 77 of PD No. 1445 or the State Audit Code of the Philippines provides that when government funds or property are transferred from one accountable officer to another, or from an outgoing officer to his successor, it shall be done upon properly itemized invoice and receipt which shall invariably support the clearance to be issued to the relieved or out-going officer, subject to regulations of the Commission.



	21)	Also, Section 80 of the same PD states that an accountable officer, upon ceasing to act in his official capacity as such, shall submit to the auditor of the agency concerned a report of his accountability.



	22)	During the latter part of CY 2020, the former Supply Officer was transferred to another department hence, a new Supply/Property Officer was designated. Upon verification, no report on the turn-over of accountabilities was prepared by the outgoing Accountable Officer thus, cash and property accountabilities in his possession were not received and duly acknowledged by the incoming Supply Officer.



	23)	It is very vital on the part of the outgoing accountable officer that he/she is cleared from money and property accountabilities and it is also important that these accountabilities be acknowledged by the incoming Accountable Officers (AOs) to pinpoint accountabilities and responsibilities. Also, lack of proper turnover between the outgoing and incoming AOs could cause confusion and difficulty in determining who is held accountable in case of loss or shortage occurred.



	24)	Management justified that the Report on Turnover of Accountabilities was received by the incoming Supply/Property Officer through Facebook messenger last October 25, 2020 as seen in the submitted screenshot. The properties assigned to the previous property officer who was in Management Services Division (MSD) were turned over through the use of Property Custodian Slip. Hard copy was not submitted to the Auditor.

	

	25)	We recommended and Management agreed to: 



a)	Officially designate a Cash Clerk or another Collecting Officer in CSC RO IV to take charge of collection and receipts in the absence of the Cashier;



b)	Instruct the OIC of the MSD of CSC RO IV to ensure that only delegated and bonded employees have access to the collections of fees and secure the safety of the Cashier’s Office from entry of unauthorized personnel; and to observe the limitations on the duties to be performed by the contract of service (CoS) and job order (JO) workers;



c)	Require the Collecting Officer of CSC RO IV to fill out properly the OR and to inform the Collecting Officer of the importance of determining accountability; and



d)	Direct the Chief, MSD of CSC RO IV to ensure the proper turnover of accountabilities between the outgoing and incoming accountable officers holding cash and property accountabilities to close the accounts of the outgoing officer and establish the accountability of the incoming officer.





	Non-submission of complete Financial Statements

		

7)	The CY 2020 consolidated financial reports and statements of the agency were not submitted within the reglementary period hindering the auditorial verification of its financial position and results of  operation during the year, and further caused undue delay in the preparation and submission of the Consolidated Annual Audit Report (CAAR). Moreover, the CSC Central Office’s (CO) financial reports and statements were only partially submitted as of February 15, 2021.



	1)	Paragraph 21 of IPSAS 1 enumerates the components of the FS as follows:

a)		Statement of Financial Position;

b)		Statement of Financial Performance; 

c)		Statement of Cash Flows;

d)		Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity;

e)		Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts; and

f)		Notes to Financial Statement, comprising a summary of significant   accounting policies and other explanatory notes.

	2)	Section 41 (2) of PD 1445 provides that the Chief Accountant or the official-in-charge of keeping the accounts of the government agency shall submit to the Commission on Audit the year-end trial balance and such other supporting or subsidiary statements as may be required by the Commission not later than the fourteenth day of February of the following year.



	3)	Failure on the part of the official concerned to submit the documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have complied with the requirements of the Commission. (Section 41(3) of PD 1445)



	4)	On February 15, 2021, the CSC CO was able to submit the year-end FS for the following components only:

				

a)	Statement of Financial Position (Condensed and Detailed)

b)	Statement of Financial Performance (Condensed and Detailed)

c)	Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity

				

	5)	Interview with the Accounting staff in charge of the initial preparation of the consolidated financial reports and statements disclosed that as a new employee he is still in the familiarization phase of the consolidation. 



	6)	While we recognize the difficulty of Management in submitting financial reports within the prescribed period, the submission of complete components of the Financial Statements (FS) beyond the prescribed period caused delay in the verification thereof, hindering the timely preparation and transmittal of the audit report.



	7)	The non-submission of financial reports had been a perennial issue which is a cause of concern that should be addressed promptly by Management. 



	8)	We recommended that Management require the CSC CO Accountant to submit the required financial reports within the prescribed period in conformity with IPSAS I, together with all the supporting trial balances and schedules. 



	9)	Management explained that the delay in submission of CSC-CO and its ROs consolidated financial reports was due to the intervening factors caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic which affected the timely evaluation of reports. Management was able to submit the said reports on April 30, 2021.





COMPLIANCE ISSUES



Delayed submission of DVs, LRs and FRs



8)	Submission of disbursement vouchers (DVs), liquidation reports (LRs) and other financial reports including their supporting documents in CSC NCR, ROs II, IV, IX, XI and BARMM were delayed from 6 days to 179 days, preventing timely review/audit of the transactions and prompt communication to Management of the recommendations/corrective measures to the deficiencies noted, if any.



	1)	Section 100 of PD 1445 requires the disbursing officers to render monthly reports of their transactions not later than the fifth day of the ensuing month to the Auditor concerned.



	2)	Section 7, Chapter 21, of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that the Chief Accountant shall submit the Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) with all the supporting documents and Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) to the COA Auditor within 20 days after receipt of the monthly bank statement. 



	3)	Section 4.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides among others, that a cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served. Moreover, Section 5.3 states that within ten (10) days after receipt of the report and supporting documents from the AO, the Accountant shall verify the report, record it in the books and submit the same with all the vouchers/payrolls and supporting documents to the Auditor.



	4)	Section 6.05 of COA Circular No. 95-006 states that the official involved in the daily recording of transactions in the books of accounts shall turn over the receipts and the disbursement records with all paid vouchers and documents evidencing the transaction to the Auditor within 10 days from the date of receipt of said documents.

	6)	The agency’s inability to submit these reports/documents within the prescribed period hindered the timely review/audit of the financial transactions of the Agency, the results thereof cannot be promptly communicated to Management and the correction of deficiencies, if any, could not be immediately undertaken.



8.7	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountants, Disbursing/Collecting Officers of CSC NCR, ROs II, IV, IX, XI and BARMM to submit, disbursement vouchers, liquidation reports and financial reports and required supporting documents, within the prescribed period, as required under Section 100 of PD 1445 and the pertinent COA Circulars, for audit and verification.





Delayed/Non-submission of Purchase Orders 



9)	Due to the non-submission of 123 copies of perfected Purchase Orders (POs) and three Contracts in CSC CO, NCR and RO IV within five (5) working days the Audit Teams were unable to conduct a timely auditorial and technical review of the procurement transactions for prompt detection/correction of possible deficiencies.



	1)	Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 states that within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned. 



	2)	In addition, Section 3.2.1 of the same Circular states that a copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and every supporting document shall, within five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned. Within the same period, the Auditor shall review and point out to Management defects and/or deficiencies, if any, in the same manner provided in the second and third sentences of item 3.1.4 hereof.



	3)	Lastly, Section 4 of the same Circular provides that any unjustified failure of the officials and employees concerned to comply with the requirements herein imposed shall be subject of the administrative disciplinary action provided in (a) Section 127 of Presidential Decree No. 1445; (b) Section 55, Title I-B, Book V of the Revised Administrative Code of 1987; and (c) Section 11 of Republic Act No. 6713.



	4)	Review made on the total numbers of POs issued by the CSC CO, NCR and RO IV for the procurement of supplies, materials and various equipment, showed that for CY 2020, 123 POs were not submitted to the Audit Team for review. Details were as follows:

	5)	It could be gleaned from Table No. 22 that of the 165 purchase orders issued by abovementioned CSC Offices, 123 or 75 percent were not submitted to the Audit Team. 



	6)	While in CSC RO IV, there were three perfected contracts included in the Report on Government Projects/Programs/Activities with a total cost of ₱10,752,900.33 that were also not submitted to the Audit Team.



	7)	Such practice caused undue delay in the auditorial/technical review of the transactions and prompt detection and correction of possible deficiency/ies, if any.



	8)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Property and Procurement Officers of CSC CO, NCR and RO IV to strictly adhere to the provisions under COA Circular No. 2009-001 particularly in the submission of POs/Contracts and the corresponding supporting documents to the Audit Team within five working days upon issuance of POs and perfection of contracts to facilitate auditorial review.





Unsettled Refunds of Local Scholarship Grants



10)	Receivables amounting to ₱16.607 million representing grants to various scholars under the Local Scholarship Program-Master’s Degree Course (LSP-MDC) remain uncollected/dormant for more than 10 years due to the absence of continuous monitoring and lack of enforcement of collections, as well as proper coordination with the CSC-CO. Moreover, non-provision of Allowance for Impairment on the receivables affected the fair presentation of the account in the Financial Statements. 



	1)	CSC Resolution No. 05-0954 and CSC Memorandum Circular No. 14, s. 2005 prescribe the guidelines for the effective implementation of the LSP-MDC policy on refund for scholars who were not able to obtain master’s degree. The scholars should complete the refund within three years upon receipt of the Notice to Refund and in case of failure to comply; they shall be administratively charged by the agency concerned for grave misconduct or conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. An additional clearance from the Commission shall be required from the scholars before they transfer to another agency, resign, or retire from the service.



	2)	COA Circular No. 2016-005 provides that all entities shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when they become due and demandable, and the Accountant shall conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis and validation of existence of the receivables.



	3)	Under Section 10, Chapter 7, GAM Volume 1, Allowance for Impairment shall be provided in an amount based on collectability of receivable balances and evaluation of such factors as aging of accounts, collection experience of the agency, expected loss experiences and identified doubtful accounts.



	4)	The LSP of the CSC was established in 1993 for the purpose of providing career development to the first and second level government employees. Certain requirements need to be met by the applicants to qualify for the program such as: a) the applicant must be a holder of a plantilla position with salary grade (SG) of 18 or above; and b) must passed written and oral examination. Once admitted, the scholar and his agency head will execute a pledge of compliance and pledge of support, respectively. The concerned Regional Office shall release the checks to respective academic institutions to fund the scholarship.



	5)	Non-completion of the program binds the scholar to an obligation to refund the tuition fee paid by the CSC.  Inability to refund in three years may result in filing of administrative charge against the LSP Scholar for grave misconduct or conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service based on factual circumstances that led to the failure of the scholar to refund and after due process.



	6)	The CSC Regional Offices (CSC-ROs) shall adopt their own strategies in effectively collecting refunds guided by, among others, the following:



a)	The CSC RO shall officially inform the scholars concerned that they should refund the amount spent by the Commission for their studies for failure to complete their course.

b)	The refund in cash or in check shall be collected by the CSC RO within a maximum period of three years to commence within one month from the date of receipt of notice of refund.



c)	The CSC RO shall write the agencies to assist the CSC in the collection of refund from their scholar employees



d)	Administrative charges for grave misconduct or conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service may be filed by the CSC RO against LSP scholars who failed to refund in three years based on factual circumstances that led to the failure of the scholar to refund after due process.



	7)	Available records of the CSC - Civil Service Institute (CSI) and reports submitted by the ROs listed in Table No. 23 showed the outstanding balances of unsettled/unpaid refund of tuition fees from the scholars who were not able to complete the master’s degree courses:

	8)	The record/official list of all the scholars were maintained by the Civil Service Institute (CSI) of the CSC CO for the monitoring of their development. The task of the NCR is to maintain individual records for payments as well as refund of tuition fees.



	9)	In the CSC NCR, the reported balance in the books of the unsettled refund for the past seven consecutive years totaled to ₱743,305.36 with no account movement.  The non-movement of the account manifested lack of effort on the part of Management to monitor and analyze the account and to impose action for recoveries, if necessary. In addition, there were no demand letters sent to the scholars, nor any letter sent to the concerned agency seeking assistance in the scholarship refunds.



	10)	Based on the summary report of LSP Scholars Status Report in the CSC-CSI database/record there were about 644 NCR scholars as of December 31, 2020 who need to refund the total amount of ₱12,598,731.19.   



	11)	Aging of the accounts could not be made since the submitted report does not provide complete information such as the date when the scholarship was granted.  According to the CSI staff, the monitoring and preparation of the report was being transferred from one person to another since 1993.



	12)	Noteworthy to mention that based on the reported book balance of ₱743,305.36 compared to the amount contained in the status report of the CSI, there was a variance of ₱11,855,425.83 in the CSC NCR alone.



	13)	The CSC NCR Chief Accountant informed that the CSC CSI failed to give information/update on the development or completion of the courses of the scholars, thereby rendering it difficult for them to trace and act on it accordingly. With lack of coordination, the collectability of the receivable account could not be facilitated.



	14)	In CSC RO IV, the amount of unsettled refunds of LSP-MDC was ₱607,020.28 since December 31, 2014.  Management commented that they are still in the process of locating the documents particularly the Memorandum of Agreement between the scholars and the CSC pertaining to the scholarship granted. 



	15)	Also, records of the CSC CSI did not tally with the CSC RO V because its database does not include yet the refunds amounting to ₱37,475.00 of five scholarships already due.  Likewise, refunds made by four scholars were still not yet recorded.



	16)	The CSC RO V had sent two demand letters to the scholars and to their respective Agency Heads, and names of some LSP-MDC Scholars were already endorsed to the legal Service Division of CSC RO V for appropriate action.



	17)	In RO VI, the amount of ₱191,250.00 remain unsettled as of December 31, 2020. During the year, Management had a hard time communicating with the scholars due to the extended implementation of the community quarantine. Also, confirmation of receivables was not performed by the Audit Team due to pandemic.

	18)	In RO VII, the Legal Services Division fast track the resolution on the Updates Administrative Disciplinary Cases (UADC) against LSP-MDC Scholars who were not able to finish their course. At present, the cases are under review.  



	19)	In CSC RO IX, out of the 17 scholars, six case reports were forwarded to its Legal Division for filing of administrative charges, if warranted. Preparation of the case was delayed due to lack of records and non-confirmation yet from the concerned schools. The legal division informed that the final legal action will be made in CY 2021.



	20)	In CSC RO XI, an amount of ₱76,405.00 was recognized in 2017, since then no refund was settled by the delinquent scholars of the said RO leaving a balance of ₱175,030.14.



	21)	While in CSC RO XII, Management informed that three demand letters were sent to the LSP Scholars but no replies were received yet.  Diligent efforts were exerted to locate their whereabouts. 



	22)	Considering the lapse of time, there is possible risk that refunds would remain uncollected.  With such risk, an allowance for impairment should be provided to reflect the fair value of the account. Without the provision for an Allowance for Impairment, the said receivables were not presented at its net realizable thus, affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements. 



	23)	The significant length of time that the aforementioned receivables remain unsettled casts doubt on their collectability.  



	24)	This is a reiteration of previous year’s audit observation.



	25)	We recommended that Management:



a)	Require the Accountant of all ROs to:



--	Coordinate with CSC CSI to obtain details/breakdown in support of the Receivable account thus, facilitating issuance of Notice of Refund to delinquent scholars and to reconcile their records to arrive at the correct balance;



--	Exhaust all possible means to collect the receivables and for those accounts which prove to be beyond collectability, requests for authority to write-off pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005 in order to clean up the books of accounts with doubtful accounts, and ensure proper documentation thereof to support requests; and



--	verify and analyze the collectability of the receivables and provide an Allowance for Impairment-Accounts Receivable so that net realizable value of the account is properly presented in the FS.



b)	Direct Legal Officers or concerned officers of the ROs to file appropriate administrative charges against liable LSP-MDC scholars for the non-settlement of their outstanding accounts.



	26)	Management informed that the OFAM has prepared a memo to all CSC Regional Offices concerned to undertake the abovementioned recommendations made by the Audit Team. 





OTHER COMPLIANCE ISSUES



Gender and Development Program (GAD)



11)	The budget for GAD programs/projects was below five percent of the CSC approved budget, thus it did not maximize its available resources affecting the Agency’s various policies on gender and development. As a result, limited recipients were catered and/or served depriving other women and their families the benefits of GAD programs, activities and projects. 



	1)	Section 31of the General Provisions of the General Appropriation Act of FY 2020 (RA No. 11465)   requires all agencies of the government to formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and shall integrate in the regular activities at least five (5) per cent of their budget.



	2)	The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least 5 percent of their budget. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement.  Utilization of the GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.



	3)	The status of implementation by CSC CO and ROs of the GAD programs and projects for CY 2020, as reported by the respective Audit Teams are presented in Appendix E. 



	4)	Though Management conducted GAD programs, activities and projects in relation to the Annual GAD Plan and Budget CY 2020, it did not maximize its available resources thus, affecting the Agency’s various policies on gender and development. As a result, limited recipients were catered and/or served depriving other women and their families in enjoying the benefits of GAD programs, activities and projects.



	5)	The CSC CO Management explained that the 2020 GAD Accomplishment Report was submitted initially through email on February 18, 2021 and resubmitted on April 14, 2021 upon the request of the Audit Team that the said file cannot be accessed. As to the fund allocation of at least 5 percent of the agency’s budget for the integration of GAD into the regular activities, Management has requested, through its letter dated May 3, 2021, for an additional five (5) working days to submit an updated report.



	6)	We acknowledged Management’s action in its effort of addressing gender issues and women’s empowerment by incorporating it in their programs and activities. It should be noted however, that actual expenses incurred and the budget allocated for achieving these programs and activities were not done in accordance with the same section of RA No. 11465, thereby an audit cannot be done in terms of budget allocation.



	7)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the GAD Focal Persons of the respective CSC Offices/ROs to integrate the GAD Plan in the regular activities of the agencies which shall be at least five percent of their budgets in compliance with Section 31 of RA 11465 and closely monitor the implementation of the GAD plans, projects and activities.

		

		

		Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability 



12)	The CSC CO and its ROs, except for ROs CAR, II, V, IX, XI, XII   and BARMM, have provided programs, projects/activities for the benefit of senior citizens and persons with disability, as required under Section 32 of RA 11465.



	1)	Section 32 of RA 11465 provides that all agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.  Moreover, all government facilities, including infrastructure, non-infrastructure and civil works projects of the government, as well as office buildings, streets and highways shall provide architectural facilities or structural features, designs, or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability, pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA No.  7277.



	2)	Management has addressed the concerns of senior citizens and PWDs by providing structural features and designs such as ramps and railings for designated comfort rooms and waiting areas to support their mobility, safety and welfare. (See Appendix F)



	3)	However, there were no new programs or projects for senior citizens and PWDs reported during the year for ROs CAR, II, V, IX, XI, XII and BARMM.



	4)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the ROs CAR, II, V, IX, XI, XII and BARMM to comply with the provisions of Section 32 of the 2020 GAA and integrate in their regular activities the plans/programs/projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disabilities. 





Tax Laws, Rules and Regulations



13)	For CY 2020, the CSC CO and its ROs were able to withhold and remit taxes pertaining to compensation of officials and employees and payments to suppliers in the total amount of ₱173.399 million and ₱163.253 million, respectively. Ending balances as at December 31, 2020 were remitted in January, 2021.            

	

	1)	BIR Revenue Regulations No. 10-2008 dated July 8, 2008 provides that all government offices are constituted as withholding agents for purposes of the creditable tax required to be withheld on income payments from compensation, contractors, suppliers of goods and services.  As withholding agents, they are primarily liable for the payment of  taxes to the National Treasury through the BIR.



	2)	Moreover, Revenue Regulations No. 1-2013 dated January 23, 2013 provides that the filing of returns and the payment of taxes shall be made on or before the 10th day following the month the taxes were withheld, except for taxes withheld for the month of December of each year, which shall be filed on or before January 15 of the succeeding year.
