Part II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
Financial Audit 

1. Various accounts of the Inter-Country Adoption Board (ICAB) under the 
Liabilities and Equity categories were misstated by the same amount of P0.248 million, 

representing 1.26 percent and 1.30 percent of its total Liabilities and total Equity, 

respectively. 

  

2. Section 111 of PD 1445 requires that the accounts of an agency shall be kept in 
such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate 

to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. It further 

states that the highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed 

in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. 

 

3. Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 
Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, provides that: “the FSs shall present fairly the 

financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation 

requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and 

conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 

revenue, and expenses set out in PPSAS. The application of PPSAS, with appropriate 

disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.” 

 

4. Volume III of the GAM for NGAs provides the Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) 
to be used by NGAs in recording transactions.   

 

5. Verification of the Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs), Disbursement Vouchers (DVs), 
Liquidation Reports (LRs), Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRSs) and supporting 

documents of the ICAB disclosed accounting errors/omissions; thereby, affecting the 

accuracy and reliability of the account balances as shown in Table 1.

6. Treasury Circular No. 03-2017 dated October 20, 2017 issued the guidelines and 
transitory provisions with regard to the reduction in the expiry period of MDS checks from 

six (6) months to three (3) months from date of issue and specifically provides that:  

 

Section 4.2.3 Other commercial banks shall not accept MDS checks for clearing 

and/or negotiation beyond the three months’ validity period from issuance date. 

 

Section 5 MDS checks to be issued starting January 2, 2018 shall already indicate 

“VALID FOR THREE MONTHS FROM DATE OF ISSUE” 
 

7. Section 44 of Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume I provides the Accounting for 
Cancelled Checks and states that: 

 

“Checks may be cancelled when they become stale, voided or spoiled. xx”  

 

A stale, voided or spoiled check shall be marked cancelled on its face and 

reported as follows: 

 

a. Voided, spoiled or unclaimed stale checks with the Cashier shall be reported 
as cancelled in the List of Unreleased Checks that will be attached to the 

RCI. 

 

b. New checks may be issued for the replacement of stale/spoiled checks in the 
hands of the payees or holders in due course, upon submission of the 

stale/spoiled checks to the Accounting Division/Unit. A certified copy of the 



31 
 

previously paid DVs shall be attached to the request for replacement. A JEV 

shall be prepared to take up the cancellation. The replacement check shall 

be reported in the RCI.

9. Review of the submitted BRS in CY 2020 disclosed that prior and current years 
cancelled/stale checks totaling ₱250,200.00 were not recorded/adjusted in the books of 

accounts, the details of which are presented in the table below:

11. As can be gleaned from Table 3, the unrecorded adjustment for Check No. 1031764 
amounting to ₱247,500.00 resulted in the understatement and overstatement of the 

Accounts Payable and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts, respectively, by the same 

amount.  



33 
 

 

12. On the other hand, while the various discrepancies in the accounting entries noted 
under Check No. 1031792 amounting to ₱2,700.00 did not result in errors in the books 

because these were corrected in the succeeding months, these still created unnecessary 

entries that could affect the reliability of account balances at a specific period.    

 

13. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Cashier to report cancelled and stale checks in the List of Unreleased 
Checks and attach the same to the RCI for these to be recorded/adjusted 

in the books; and   

 

b. The Accountant to make the necessary adjusting entries in the books of 
accounts to reflect the correct balances of the affected accounts, and 

henceforth, record any cancelled/stale checks in order to present the 

accurate value of cash and the corresponding liabilities in the books. 

 

B.  Erroneous recording of Transactions 

 

B.1 Improper recognition of prior year’s expenses paid out of the Petty Cash Fund 

(PCF) and Cash Advance (CA) – Ᵽ6,616.04 

 

14. Section 2a, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of the GAM for NGAs defines Accrual basis as a 
basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are recognized when they 

occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the 

transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the 

financial statements of the periods to which they relate. The elements recognized under 

accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue, and expenses. 

 

15. Reimbursements of expenses totaling ₱6,616.04 paid out of the PCF and CA of one 
(1) Accountable Officer (AO) in CY 2019 were recognized or recorded in the books of 

accounts as CY 2020 expenses, with details as follows: 

 
Table 4. Prior year’s (CY 2019) expenses recognized in CY 2020 

 

Date Particulars Amount Remarks 

02/05/2020 
Reimbursement of expenses in

Materials Expenses

Reimbursement of expenses. re: 
Year-End convocation for CY 
2019 

1,505.39 
Recorded as Other Maintenance 
and Operating Expenses 

TOTAL  ₱6,616.04  

 

16. The non-recognition of these expenses was due to the non-submission by the AO 
to the Accounting Unit of the documents pertaining to year-end expenses incurred as of 



34 
 

CY 2019 that were paid out of the PCF and the delayed liquidation of her CA in December 

2019. 

 

17. As a result, the related prior year and current year’s expenses were understated and 
overstated, respectively, by the same amount of ₱6,616.04. 

 

18. We recommended and Management agreed to require the AO to submit to the 
Accounting Unit the documents related to the disbursements made out of the PCF 

with a summary of expenses incurred as of year-end from the last replenishment for 

recording purposes and proper recognition of the period to which it relates. 

 

19. We also recommended that Management, henceforth, observe and strictly 
apply the proper accounting of transactions under the accrual basis method. 

 

B.2 Erroneous recording of prior and current year transactions - Ᵽ285,370.00 

 

20. Paragraph 27 of PPSAS 1 states that: 
 

“Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial 

performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful 

representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in 

accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 

revenue, and expenses set out in PPSASs. Xxx” 

 

21. COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 prescribes the adoption of the 
updated Volume III - Revised Charts of Accounts of the GAM for National Government 

Agencies and provides for the following definition of accounts: 

 
Table 5. Definition of Accounts per GAM Volume III 

 

Account Name Description 

Accumulated 
Surplus/(Deficit) 

This account is used to recognize the cumulative results of normal and 
continuous operations of an agency including prior period 
adjustments, effect of changes in accounting policy and other capital 
adjustments. Xxx. 

Training Expenses This account is used to recognize the costs incurred for the 
participation/ attendance in and conduct of trainings, conventions and 
seminars/workshops. It includes training fees, honoraria of lecturers, 
cost of handouts, supplies, materials, meals, snacks and all other 
training related expenses. Xxx. 

Consultancy Services This account is used to recognize the cost of services rendered by 
consultants contracted to perform particular outputs or services 
primarily advisory in nature and requiring highly specialized or 
technical expertise which cannot be provided by the regular staff of the 
agency. Xxx. 

Other Professional 
Services 

This account is used to recognize the cost of other professional 
services contracted by the agency not otherwise classified under any 
of the specific professional services accounts. Xxx. 



35 
 

 

22. Audit of the Training Expenses, Consultancy Services and Other Professional 
Services accounts in CY 2020 disclosed that various transactions recorded under the said 

accounts amounting to ₱103,040.00, ₱193,600.00 and ₱486,936.48, respectively, were 

improperly classified which are inconsistent with the definitions provided under Volume 

III of the GAM due to the failure of the Accountant to thoroughly review the correctness 

of the journal entries before recording in the books of accounts. Details are presented in 

the Tables 6, 7 and 8 below:

23. The erroneous recording and misclassification of accounts pertaining to the above 
transactions affected the balances of various related expense accounts that resulted in the 

(over)/understatement of account balances appearing in the financial statements, as

24. As a result of the above erroneous recordings made, there was an understatement 
of Training Expenses and Consultancy Services accounts by ₱164,646.48 and ₱36,920.00, 

respectively, and overstatement of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) and Other Professional 

Services accounts by ₱285,370.00 and ₱486,936.48, correspondingly. 

 



38 
 

25. Misclassification of accounts shows lapses in internal controls in the recording of 
transactions. It also implies laxity in the review of the journal entries prior to the recording 

of transactions in the books. Thus, transactions were not faithfully represented in the 

Statement of Financial Performance, which affected the fair presentation of the accounts 

and transactions in the FS taken as a whole. 

 

26. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

 

a. make the necessary adjustments/correcting entries in the books of accounts 
to reflect the correct balances of the affected accounts; and  
 

b. strengthen the financial control systems to ensure that all transactions are 
properly recorded in the books of accounts in the periods to which they 

relate. 

 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

27. Various accounting deficiencies totaling ₱23.917 million were also noted in the 
recording of the transactions of various accounts that have impact on the fairness of 

presentation of the balances of the accounts in the FSs as summarized in Table 10.

28. Section 58 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 states that – 
 

The examination and audit of assets shall be performed with a view to 

ascertaining their existence, ownership, valuation and encumbrances as well 

as the propriety of items composing the respective asset accounts, determining 

their agreement with records; proving the accuracy of such records; 

ascertaining if the assets were utilized economically, efficiently and effectively; 

and evaluating the adequacy of controls over the accounts. 
 

29. Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I, provides the following pertinent provisions: 
 

Sec. 38. Physical Count of PPE. The entity shall have a periodic physical count 

of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the 

Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 73) as 

at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned 

not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and 

losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting 

Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording.  

 

Sec. 40 d. Idle, Unserviceable and Fully Depreciated PPE. All unserviceable 

property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of 

Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74). PPE reported in the IIRUP 

shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant 

and Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation). 

 

Sec. 42. Accounting and Property Records to be maintained for PPE. The 

Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE 

including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to 

record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, 

depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. 

For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise 

maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition 

of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained 

by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other 

property records like PAR. 

 

The following are the forms/reports necessary to account for PPE: 

  

 d. Property Card (Appendix 69) – this card shall be used by the 

Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to record the description, 

acquisition, transfer, disposal, and other information about the PPE. 

It shall be kept for each class of PPE  

 

e. Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (Appendix 70)– this 

card shall be used for each class of PPE to record the acquisition, 

description, custody, estimated life, depreciation, impairment, 

disposal, transfer/adjustment, repair history and other information 



40 
 

about the property. It shall be kept and maintained by the Accounting 

Office/Unit.  

 

g. Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment 

(Appendix 73) – this form shall be used to report the physical count 

and condition of PPE by type as at a given date, including those which 

are unrecorded and those which could not be accounted for. It shows 

the balance of PPE per property cards and per count and the 

shortage/overage, if any. It shall be rendered by the Inventory 

Committee, on its yearly physical count of properties owned by the 

entity.  

 

30. In addition, Section 10, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I states the following 
guidelines relating to Semi-Expendable Properties: 

 

Sec. 10. Semi-expendable Property. Tangible items below the capitalization 

threshold of ₱15,000 shall be accounted as semi-expendable property. The 

following policies apply as follows:  

 

a. Semi-expendable properties which were recognized as PPE shall 

be reclassified to the affected accounts. 

 

 b. These tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon issue to 

the end-user. 

 

31. Furthermore, Appendix 70(D) - Instructions on the PPELC of the GAM, Volume 

II, emphasized that: 

 

“A. The PPELC shall be reconciled with the report on the physical count of 

PPE, PC and the control accounts. Any discrepancy shall be immediately 

verified and adjusted.” 

 

32. The conduct of physical inventory of properties and equipment is one way of 
attesting the physical existence of properties and serves as basis for preparing accounting 

reports. The RPCPPE is the form used to report on the physical count of PPE by types 

which are owned by the agency. 

 

33. The Management, through the Inventory Committee, conducted the CY 2020 
physical inventory of its PPE, the result of which is contained in the Report of Physical 

Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as of December 31, 2020.  Comparison 

between the accounting records and the result of the RPCPPE showed an unreconciled 

material difference of P21,135,234.52, as shown in Table 11.

34. Likewise, the Property/Supply Officer maintains a Property Card (PC) for each 
class of PPE. However, we observed the following deficiencies in the maintenance of PCs: 

 

a. The type of fixed asset that should be indicated in the Property, Plant and 
Equipment portion in the PC was not filled up; and 

 

b. Several PPEs have no designated Property Numbers. 

 
35. Appendix 69 of the GAM, Volume II also laid out the instructions in accomplishing 
the PCs and specifically states that the RPCPPE shall be reconciled with the PCs every 

year and any discrepancies should be immediately verified and adjusted. Nevertheless, 

verification of the submitted RPCPPE vis-à-vis the maintained PCs of various PPEs 

revealed unreconciled variances totaling ₱7,208,764.16, to wit:

TOTAL 10,285,931.60 3,077,167.44 7,208,764.16 

 

36. Conversely, PPELCs are kept in the Accounting Unit for each class of PPE. Yet, 
the same were not properly maintained and were noted to have the following deficiencies:  

 

a. The Description portion of the PPELC only contains general explanation and 
without exact specifications of the item; 

 

b. The Reference column is not filled up; and 
 



42 
 

c. The Qty. segment is inaccurate for there were noted PPE items that consist of 
several quantities and recorded in bulk in PPELC but the Qty. column only 

indicates “1” as the number of unit/s. 

 

37. The PPELC could not also be completely relied upon as these are not updated and 
upon verification, the PPE balances in the PPELCs do not coincide with the balances 

appearing in the books of accounts. Comparison of amounts between PPELCs and 

Accounting Records resulted in a discrepancy totaling ₱3,291,945.21, as summarized in 

Table 13 below:

TOTAL 35,495,866.12 32,203,920.91 3,291,945.21 

 

38. Analysis of PPE accounts in the schedules above disclosed the following 
deficiencies:  

 

 Buildings 
 

39. Comparison between the accounting records and the RPCPPE showed that this 
account has a variance of ₱2,963,769.67. The submitted RPCPPE does not have any PPEs 

classified under the Buildings category but upon verification, it was revealed that the 

construction of 3-storey building by DPWH amounting to ₱654,720.00 was inadvertently 

reported under Furniture & Fixtures in the RPCPPE. Moreover, analysis and reconciliation 

of the PPELC and RPCPPE showed that the PPELC has a total of ₱5,554,164.33 accounted 

under the Buildings account which were not reported in the RPCPPE. 

 

 Office Equipment 
 

40. The balances between the RPCPPE and PC differed by ₱1,174,585.69. The said 
difference is attributed to the net amount of items reported in the RPCPPE which have no 

corresponding PCs on record totaling ₱1,228,274.57 and to one (1) split type Koppel Air 

Conditioner with Property Number 2000-630 amounting to ₱53,688.88 which has a PC but 

was not reported in the RPCPPE. 

 



43 
 

41. Moreover, it was also noted that a number of items in the RPCPPE totaling 
₱383,999.55 were classified under the Office Equipment category even if it did not reach 

the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00. The said items should have been more 

appropriately categorized under Semi-Expendable Office Equipment. 

42. On the other hand, the PPELC has accounted for Office Equipment items totaling 
₱2,504,473.45 which were not reported in the RPCPPE. In contrast, the RPCPPE includes 

a number of Office Equipment in the total amount of ₱689,748.75 which were not recorded 

in the PPELC. 

 

43. Out of the total amount of ₱3,895,519.29 Office Equipment items accounted for in 
the PPELC, ₱215,634.29 pertains to tangible items acquired in the prior years costing less 

than ₱15,000 which should have been reclassified to Semi-Expendable expenses during 

the period in which they were issued, hence, warrants an adjustment to the Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) account. 

 

 ICT Equipment 
 

44. Reconciliation of ICT Equipment balances of the RPCPPE and PC showed that the 
RPCPPE balance is greater than the PC balance by an aggregate net amount of 

₱2,135,336.65.  

 

45. It was likewise noted that the Development of Scalable Web Information System 
on ICA (PISICA) is included under the ICT Equipment category in the RPCPPE. The said 

asset is intangible in nature, thus, must be classified as Computer Software. In addition, a 

total amount of ₱184,919.50 Semi-Expendable ICT Equipment was also reported under the 

ICT Equipment category in the RPCPPE. 

 

46. Moreover, no IIRUP was prepared and submitted by the Property Officer for CY 
2020 notwithstanding ICT Equipment accumulating ₱787,233.37 that were already tagged 

as unserviceable in the RPCPPE. 

 

47. Further, verification of PPELCs alongside RPCPPE for ICT Equipment also 
disclosed several items recorded in the PPELCs which were not found in the RPCPPE and 

vice versa totaling ₱4,473,664.82 and ₱755,055.00, respectively. 

 

48. Out of the total amount of ₱8,086,955.00 ICT Equipment items accounted for in 
the PPELC, ₱288,654.50 pertains to tangible items acquired in the prior years costing less 

than ₱15,000, which should have been reclassified to Semi-Expendable expenses during 

the period in which they were issued, hence, warrants an adjustment to the Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) account.  

 

 Communication Equipment 
 

49. There were no PPE items reported in the RPCPPE as well as PCs being maintained 
for this category by the Property Officer. In PPELC, the balance of Communication 

Equipment totaled ₱1,100,928.80 and out of this, an aggregate amount of ₱110,118.80 



44 
 

relates to semi-expendable items that should have been adjusted and reclassified as to 

expenses in the books during the period of issuance. The same should be adjusted to 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account and eliminated in the PPE accounts.   

 

 Furniture and Fixtures 
 

50. Out of the ₱1,653,665.07 reported Furniture and Fixtures in the RPCPPE, only the 
Conference Table acquired in CY 2015 with Property Number 15-07-12 and amounting 

₱65,400.00 was found to have been maintained with a Property Card. 

 

51. Comparison between PPELC and RPCPPE on the other hand, showed items 
recorded in the PPELCs which were not reported in the RPCPPE and vice versa totaling 

₱820,278.08 and ₱284,312.57, respectively 

 

52. Like in the case of PPEs previously discussed above, the RPCPPE and PPELC both 
include items purchased and issued in the prior years that did not reach the capitalization 

threshold amounting to ₱574,199.57 and ₱127,796.70, respectively, thus, merits the 

reclassification of items to its proper category and adjustment in the books. 

 

 Books 
 

53. The recorded amount of ₱5,204.00 in the books should be dropped off from the 
total accounts under PPE and should be adjusted in the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) 

account as these should already be treated as a semi-expendable expense of the previous 

periods. 

 

 Other PPE 
 

54. The Other PPE items reported in the RPCPPE with no corresponding PCs totaled 
₱2,310,576.75. Of this amount, ₱55,807.75 worth of items that were acquired in the prior 

years did not reach the capitalization threshold and thus, are improperly classified as PPE. 

 

55. In addition, a total of ₱881,856.00 worth of PPE items acquired in CY 2020 
consisting of various ICT and Office Equipment items were incorrectly classified by the 

Property Officer under the Other PPE category in the RPCPPE. 

 

56. Lastly, out of the ₱2,100,841.35 Other PPE items recorded in the PPELC, only PPE 
totaling ₱1,822,531.00 were determined to pass the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 

for PPE, while the rest fell short and should be adjusted accordingly: 

 

57. On the context of items reflected in the books but not in the RPCPPE, it implies 
that either there are missing/unaccounted items especially in the case of handy personal 

properties, or it could also denote that there were disposals made which were not yet 

recognized by the Accounting Unit. On the other hand, those items reflected in the 

RPCPPE but not in the books indicate that there were unrecognized/unrecorded items in 

the books that physically exist. 



45 
 

58. The abovementioned errors and discrepancies were further attributed to: (a) 
inadequate coordination between the Supply/Property Officer and the Accountant on the 

proper categorization of the PPE; (b) inadequate review by the Accountant of the proper 

classification of PPE in the entries made; and (c) non-periodic reconciliation of accounting 

and property records. 

 

59. Furthermore, it was also observed that the Accounting and Property Units do not 
maintain identical property/reference numbers which posed difficulty in matching the 

items recorded under the different accounts of PPE. More so, variances relating to the 

acquisition years of some PPE also add up to the notable issues observed.  

 

60. As a result, the existence, accuracy and reliability of the balance of the Property, 
Plant and Equipment appearing in the financial statements amounting to P35,495,866.12 

as at December 31, 2020 could not be relied upon. 

 

61. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Accountant and the Property/Supply Officer to: 
 

(i) maintain and update the PPELCs and PCs as required for each 
category of PPE, especially for those items that were included in the 

RPCPPE but were not included in the corresponding PCs and PPELCs 

on record; 

 

(ii) conduct a periodic reconciliation after the RPCPPE is finalized to 
identify the causes of the differences and act accordingly; 

 

(iii) consider the use of identical property numbers both in the Accounting 
and Property records to establish uniformity and ease in the 

reconciliation of PPE; and 

 

(iv) collaborate with each other to provide specific guidelines in the 
evaluation and proper categorization of different PPE items; 

 

b. The Property/Supply Officer to: 
 

(i) cancel the Property Acknowledgement Receipts (PARs) of those items 
determined as Semi-Expendable and in exchange, issue an Inventory 

Custodian Slip (ICS) to the end-users to establish accountability over 

the items; and 

 

(ii) in the case of old PPE in which the whereabouts could not be located, 
the same should be considered/treated as lost and in that 

circumstance, a relief from property accountability should be filed; 

and 

 



46 
 

c. The Accountant to classify those unrecorded and not yet issued PPE items 
that did not reach the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 to their 

appropriate semi-expendable property accounts, otherwise, 

reclassification and adjustments in the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) 

account should be made if already issued and recorded in the prior years. 

 

62.  The Accountant commented that before, the capitalization threshold to be 
classified as PPE was ₱10,000.00. All the items recorded as PPE that did not reach the 

capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 were recorded prior to the issuance of the new 

threshold policy.  

 

63. Nevertheless, she further commented that in compliance with COA 
recommendations and to adhere to the new threshold policy of COA, the Accountant will 

reclassify those recorded PPE items below ₱15,000.00 threshold. Note that all the items 

are all fully depreciated as of to date with a carrying amount equivalent to residual value. 

 

b. Discrepancies in the Receipts and Payments portion of the SCBAA and SCF 
 

64. Sections 28 and 26 of Chapters 2 and 3, respectively, of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I provide for the description and basis for the 

preparation of the Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts (SCBAA) as 

follows: 

 

 Sec. 28. Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts. A 

comparison of budget and actual amounts will enhance the transparency of 

financial reporting in government. This shall be presented by government 

agencies as a separate additional financial statement referred in this Manual 

as the Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts (SCBAA). 

 

Sec. 26. Xxx. This shall be prepared based on the various registries maintained 

by the Budget Division/Unit such as the RRORs, RAPAL, RAOD/RBUD and 

other SDs. The data on Actual Amounts shall be verified by the Accounting 

Division/Unit in the Statement of Cash Flows (SCF). The statement shall 

present the following: 

 

a. The original (approved appropriations, prior year’s not yet 

due and demandable obligations) and final budget (continuing 

appropriations, transfers, realignments and withdrawals) 

amounts; 

b. The actual amounts on a comparable basis; and  

c. By way of note disclosure, an explanation of the material 

differences between the budget and actual amounts, which are 

not included in the financial statements. 

 



47 
 

65. Likewise, Sections 27 and 28, Chapter 3 of the same Manual also discussed the 

following: 

Sec. 27. Changes from Original to Final Budget. An entity shall present an 

explanation of whether the changes between the original and final budget are 

a consequence of reallocations within the budget by way of note disclosure in 

the FSs. 

 

Sec. 28. Reconciliation of Actual Amounts on a Comparable Basis (Budget) 

and Actual Amounts in the Financial Statements. The actual amounts 

presented on a comparable basis to the budget shall be reconciled with the 

actual amounts presented in the FSs identifying separately the differences 

classified as follows: 

 

a. Basis Differences, which occur when the approved budget is 

prepared on a basis other than the accounting basis; 

b. Timing Differences, which occur when the budget period differs 

from the reporting period reflected in the FSs; and 

c. Entity Differences, which occur when the budget omits program 

or entities that are part of the entity for which the FSs are 

prepared. 

 

The reconciliation shall be disclosed as part of the Notes to the FSs. 

 

66. Conversely, Section 22, Chapter 19 of the GAM, Volume I provides for the purpose 
of the preparation of the Statement of Cash Flows (SCF) as one of the major components 

of Financial Statements: 

 

Sec. 22. Statement of Cash Flows. The Statement of Cash Flows summarizes 

the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of an entity 

during a given period. It identifies the sources of cash inflows, the items on 

which cash was expended during the reporting period, and the cash balance as 

at the reporting date. 

 

67. The SCBAA of the agency was prepared by the Budget Officer based on the FS, 
particularly the SCF for the receipts section and Registry of Allotments, Obligation and 

Disbursements (RAOD)/Registry of Budget, Utilization and Disbursements (RBUD) for 

the payments section. 

 

68. In the receipts portion of the SCBAA, the “Budgeted Amount” column is equivalent 
to P24,759,800.00, the projected revenues of ICAB, with a minor discrepancy as compared 

to the amount of the annual revenue target indicated per Budget of Expenditures and 

Sources of Finances (BESF) amounting to P24,760,000.00. On the other hand, the “Actual 

Amounts” column of P12,956,898.72 was based on the total collection of income/revenues 

reported in the SCF. However, the cumulative total collections reflected in FAR No. 5 as 

at year-end totaled P12,718,075.29; thus, a discrepancy of P238,823.43 with what was 



48 
 

reported in the SCBAA. Moreover, other receipts of P237,865.42 reported in the SCF were 

not reflected in the receipts portion of the SCBAA.  

 

69. The ICAB has an approved appropriation for CY 2020 of P59,382,000.00 per 
General Appropriations Act (GAA), Retirement and Life Insurance Premium (RLIP) of 

P1,723,000.00 or a total of P61,105,000.00 that was presented in the “Original Budgeted 

Amount” in the payments portion of the SCBAA. A modification on the budget was made 

pursuant to NBC No. 580, thereby, adjusting the budgeted amount to ₱56,633,500.00 

which was presented in the “Final Budgeted Amount” in the payments portion of the 

SCBAA.  The “Actual Amounts” under the Payments portion of the SCBAA totaling 

P42,814,055.60 was based on the total obligations (paid and unpaid) per RAOD/RBUD 

from the current year appropriations instead of the total actual payments/disbursements 

only. 

 

70. Review of the FSs revealed discrepancies between the balances presented in the 
SCBAA and SCF for Fund 101 as presented in the table below: 

 
       Table 14. Comparative Analysis of FSs 

Particulars Per SCBAA Per SCF Discrepancy 

Receipts P12,956,898.72 P13,194,764.14* P(237,865.42) 

Payments 42,814,055.60 43,752,807.61** (938,752.01) 

TOTAL P55,770,954.32 P56,947,571.75 P(1,176,617.43) 
 

*composed of the following cash inflows from the SCF: Collection of Income/Revenues and 

Other Receipts 

 
**composed of the following cash outflows from the SCF: Payment of Expenses, Purchase of 

Inventories, Grant of Cash Advances, Prepayments, Remittance of Taxes Withheld, Remittance 

of Personnel Benefit Contributions & Mandatory Deductions and Purchase/Construction of 

Property, Plant & Equipment  

 

71. The differences between totals for receipts and payments in the SCBAA and cash 
inflows and outflows of the SCF were due to the discrepancies between FARs, registries 

and accounting reports, among others.  There was also no disclosure about the differences 

between the final budget and actual amount in the Notes to the Financial Statements (NFS) 

as required in the GAM which did not provide readers of the FSs adequate information on 

the said differences. 

 

72. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Budget Officer 
and the Accountant to: 

 

a. analyze the noted discrepancies and ensure that the reported data on the 
SCBAA and the SCF are reconciled for the fair presentation of both FSs; 

 

b. prepare the SCBAA based on total actual receipts and payments only; and 
 

c. any noted differences should be disclosed in the Notes to FS. 



49 
 

 

73. The Budget Officer commented that the amount of total collections as at December 
31, 2020, which was reported in the SCBAA amounting to ₱12,956,898.72, was based on 

the amount of the total collections reported in the SCF submitted by the Accounting Unit. 

The amount reported is more accurate and supported with the Certificate of Income 

Collections from the Bureau of the Treasury. 
 

c. Unreconciled discrepancies between the FS and FARs  
 

74. Section 31, Chapter 3 of GAM, Volume I enumerates the different budget 
reports/documents to be prepared and submitted as required by DBM and COA, among 

which are the following: 

 

Xxx 

 

b. Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and 

Balances –Financial Accountability Report (FAR) No. 1 (SAAODB) 

(Appendix 17). This report shall reflect the authorized appropriations and 

adjustments, total allotments received including transfers, total obligations, 

total disbursements and the balances of unreleased appropriations, 

unobligated allotments, and unpaid obligations of a department/office/entity 

by source and by allotment class. Xxx. 

 

c. Summary of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and 

Balances by Object of Expenditures – FAR No. 1.A (SAAODBOE) 

(Appendix 18).This report shall be prepared by Funding Source Code (FSC) 

as clustered and shall reflect the summary of appropriations, allotments, 

obligations, disbursements and balances detailed by object of expenditures 

consistent with the COA Revised Chart of Accounts per COA Circular No. 

2013-002 dated January 30, 2013 and the Adoption of the PPSAS per COA 

Resolution No. 2014-003 dated January 24, 2014. 

 

Xxx 

 

g. Aging of Due and Demandable Obligations – FAR No. 3 (Appendix 22). 

This report shall be prepared by FSC as clustered and shall reflect the 

balance of unpaid obligations as indicated in the Obligation Request (ObR) 

and the ADDOs as at yearend. 

 

h. Monthly Report of Disbursements – FAR No. 4 (Appendix 23). The report 

shall reflect the total disbursements made by department, office or entity and 

operating unit from disbursement authorities. Xxx 

 

75. Analysis of the disbursements portions of the SAAODB-FAR No. 1 and Monthly 
Report of Disbursements-FAR No. 4 for current year appropriations of Fund 101 showed

that, although both are on a cash basis, there was a total discrepancy of P1,312,242.43 as 

presented in the table below:

TOTAL 42,360,676.83 43,672,919.26 P(1,312,242.43) 

     

76. The discrepancies were due to the disbursements in Personnel Services (PS) of 
₱84,067.93 which were included in the total disbursements in FAR No. 1 and 

disbursements in Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) and Financial 

Expenses (FE) of P1,400,624.61 and P603,987.06, respectively, or a total of P2,004,611.67 

which were included in the total disbursements in FAR No. 4. The remaining discrepancy 

in Capital Outlay (CO) of P608,301.31 was due to payment of the Information and 

Communications Technology (ICT) equipment which were not recognized in FAR No. 4.  

 

77. Moreover, analysis of the obligations portion of SAAODBE-FAR No. 1a for both 
current year and continuing appropriations as against the balances appearing in the 

submitted FSs (Statement of Financial Performance and SCF) of the Regular Fund also 

revealed differences totaling ₱1,603,895.05, details are presented below:

79. It is to be noted that FAR 1a is also one of the supporting documents as basis for 
the preparation of the SCBAA; thus, the notable inconsistencies presented above between 

the budget and the FS should be reconciled and differences must be identified and classified 

accordingly and disclosed in the Notes to the FS. As a result of the above, it casts doubt as 

to whether the differences in amounts were a result of either basis/timing/entity differences 

or possible human error on the part of the preparers of the reports, thereby affecting the 

accuracy, completeness, and reliability of the books of accounts and FARs of the agency. 

 

80. Moreover, the Aging of Due and Demandable Obligations – FAR No. 3 was not 
submitted to the Audit Team, for the same was not being prepared and maintained as per 

inquiry with the Budget Officer. The non-preparation and non-submission of FAR No. 3 

hindered the Audit Team from evaluating whether the reported unpaid obligations in the 

SAAODB-FAR No. 1 and liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position (SFP) are fairly 

stated. 

 

81. We recommended that Management require the Budget Officer and 

Accountant to: 

 

a. analyze the transactions affected by the noted discrepancies and make the 
necessary adjustments to correct the balances presented in the books of 

accounts and FARs; 
 

b. conduct regular reconciliation of the FARs with the FSs to ensure the 
correctness and accuracy of the reported balances; and 

 

c. facilitate the preparation of FAR No. 3 to provide details of unpaid 
obligations in the SAAODB-FAR No. 1 and submit a copy to the Audit 

Team for review. 

 

82. The Budget Officer commented that the discrepancies between the FS and FARs 
maybe was due to the timing differences which occur when the budget period differs from 

the reporting period reflected in the FS. 

 

83. On the Budget side, FAR 1 includes the FY 2020 current year transactions and the 
amount of late billings pertaining to FY 2019 transactions which are usually charged to the 

Continuing Appropriations. Also included in the report are the late billings pertaining to 

FY 2020 transactions received before January 31, 2021 because the FY 2020 FAR 1 should 

be submitted on or before January 31, 2021. 

 

84. However, SCF includes payments of FY 2019 Accounts Payable paid in FY 2020 
and the amount of late billings pertaining to FY 2020 transactions received on or before 

February 14, 2021. 

 

85. On the Budget side, all payments are recorded as expense while the Accounting 
Unit uses Fixed Assets, Inventory, and Prepaid accounts in recording financial transactions. 



53 
 

Further, all ICAB obligations/financial transactions which are recorded in the RAOD and 

RBUD are supported with pre-numbered Obligation Request and Status attached to the 

Disbursement Vouchers in process. 

 

86. Lastly, the ICAB is not preparing and submitting FAR No.3 - Aging of Unpaid 
Obligations for the reason that all ICAB Accounts Payable are immediately paid in January 

of the following year. However, if the report is required to be prepared and submitted, the 

Accounting Unit will comply with the requirement. 

 

d. Unreconciled balances between books and RPCI/inventory report/records - 
₱1,471.90 

 

87. Pertinent provisions of Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), 
Volume I provides, among others: 

 

Section 13.  Xxxx. Physical count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an 

indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property 

custodianship. 

. 

Section 17. (b)  Stock Cards (SC) – shall be used to record all receipts and issues 

of supplies and the balance in quantity at any time. It shall be 

maintained by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit for each 

item in stock. 

   

 (c) Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) –  shall be used to record materials 

received, issued and the balance both in quantity and amount at 

any time. It shall be maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit 

for each kind of supplies and materials. 

 

88. As at December 31, 2020, the recorded balances of Office Supplies Inventory and 
Other Supplies & Materials Inventory accounts were Ᵽ205,396.74 and Ᵽ32,227.03, 

respectively. Comparison, however, of the balances per Accounting records and the Report 

of Physical Count of Inventory (RPCI) as at December 31, 2020 disclosed a difference 

totaling P1,471.90, details are as follows: 

 
Table 19. Comparison of balances of Office Supplies Inventory and Other Supplies and Materials 

Inventory per Books and Physical count

Total P 237,623.77 P 236,151.87 P 1,471.90 

 

89. The difference in the balances of the Office Supplies Inventory and Other Supplies 
and Materials Inventory accounts can be attributed to the failure to conduct reconciliation 

of the accounting and supply records by the Accounting and Property Units. 



54 
 

 

90. Moreover, examination of the submitted RPCI also showed variances in quantity 
and balances between the Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs), Stocks Cards (SCs) and the actual 

physical count as shown in Tables 20, 21 and 22 below:

91. The differences in the quantity and amount presented in the above tables are due to 

the failure of the Property/Supply Officer to consistently update his Stock Cards due to the 

voluminous workload. He informed the Audit Team that at present, he is the procurement 

officer and at the same time the liaison officer since March 2020, when the former liaison 

officer resigned. 

92. As a result, the unreconciled differences between the accounting and property 
records and that of the RPCI cast doubts on the accuracy and reliability of the reported 

account balances of the Office Supplies Inventory and Other Supplies and Materials 

Inventory accounts as at December 31, 2020. 

 

93. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting and 
Property/Supply Unit to conduct a periodic reconciliation of their records in order to 

determine the causes of discrepancies and to effect the required adjustments in the 

books of accounts and/or supply records. 



55 
 

 

94. We further recommended and Management agreed to require the 
Property/Supply Officer to ensure that the Stock Cards are properly maintained and 

updated by recording promptly the receipts and/or issuances of inventories at any 

given time. 

 

95. In summary, due to the significant impact on the financial statements of the total 
misstatements of the same amount of ₱0.248 million representing 1.26 percent and 1.30 

percent of the agency’s total Liabilities and Net Assets/Equity, respectively, and with total 

deficiencies of ₱23.917 million, we rendered a Qualified Opinion on the financial 

statements of the ICAB as at year-end.  
 

Compliance Audit 

 
Delayed Submission of Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRSs) 

 

96. Delayed submission of the BRSs ranging from approximately one (1) to six (6) 
months from month-end, contrary to Section 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I 

impeded the timely audit and verification of BRSs; thus, corrective measures could 

not be immediately undertaken when any discrepancy/error or other reconciling 

items are ascertained, which might require adjustments by the agency. 

 

97. Section 7 of Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I 
states that: 

 

The Chief Accountant shall submit the Bank Reconciliation Statement within 

twenty days after receipt of the monthly Bank Statement to the following:  

 

  Original – COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents and JEV) 

  Copy 2 - Head of Agency/entity 

  Copy 3 – Head Division/ Unit File 

  Copy 4 – Bank, if necessary 

 

98. Presented in Table 23 is the monitoring schedule on when Management submitted 
their final Bank Reconciliation Statements:

99. Since there was no indication as to the date of receipt of the bank statements, inquiry 
was made and it was found out that the Accounting Unit failed to record the actual dates 

of receipt of the bank statements. The Accountant also averred that the Cashier has been 

consistently making verbal follow-ups with the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) on the 

submission of ICAB’s bank statements and affirmed that delays in the submission of the 

BRSs is on account of LBP’s late forwarding of the bank statements to the agency, hence, 

resulting in the incurrence of delays in the submission of the BRSs to COA ranging from 

approximately one (1) to six (6) months. 

 

100. Failure to submit the BRS on time resulted in failure of the auditor to conduct timely 
verification of the veracity and accuracy of the BRS. Further, any error in the BRS when 

not corrected immediately will remain/appear in all of the succeeding BRSs; hence, it is of 

utmost importance to submit the BRS on time. 

 

101. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Cashier to follow up the bank statements in writing aside from the 
verbal follow-ups being made, to facilitate the receipt of the bank 

statements for bank reconciliation purposes; and 

 

b. The Accountant to monitor the receipt of the bank statements by having 
them stamped as received and indicating the dates these were actually 

obtained, as evidence that the BRSs are submitted to COA within the 

prescribed period provided for in the GAM. 
 



57 
 

Incomplete documentation - P408,903.38 

 

102. Disbursements totaling P0.409 million were not properly supported with 
complete documentation, thus, affecting the authenticity, validity and regularity of 

the financial transactions made out from the fund. 

 

103. Section 4 (6) of PD 1445, otherwise known as the State Audit Code of the 
Philippines, requires complete documentation to support claims against government funds. 

 

104.  Review of accounts showed that disbursements of ₱408,903.38 were not properly 
supported with complete documentation due to the non-submission of supporting 

documents caused by the failure to properly examine the attached supporting documents 

required for government transactions, thereby affecting the authenticity, validity and 

regularity of the transactions as shown in Table 24.

105. We recommended and Management agreed to require:  
 

a. The Accountable Officers and the Accountant to submit the required 
supporting documents to the Office of the Auditor to avoid suspension 

and/or disallowance; 

 

b. The Accountant to: 
 

(i) ensure that necessary supporting documents are obtained and 
complete, before processing, to support the authenticity and validity 

of the transactions; and 

 

(ii) regularly attach Certification that the previous cash advances have 
been liquidated and accounted for in the books as common 

documentary requirement for cash advances; and 

 

c. The Administrative Unit to: 
 

(i) revise the Special Order or authority of the accountable officer 
indicating her maximum cash accountability pursuant to GAM; and 

 

(ii) prepare a one-month estimate of petty expenses based on historical 
data and have it approved by the Head of the Agency as basis for the 

cash advance for PCF. 

 

Lapses in the granting, utilization, liquidation/replenishment and reporting of cash 

advances 

 

106. Lapses of the Accountant and Accountable Officers (AO) in the granting, 
utilization, liquidation/replenishment and reporting of cash advances (CA) resulted 



59 
 

in unmonitored cash accountability at a given date and exposing the cash to possible 

risk of loss or misuse. 

a) Granting and utilization of cash advance 
 

 Incorrect accounting treatment of Petty Cash Fund (PCF) 
 

107. Section 35, Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume I provides that the PCF shall be 
maintained using the Imprest System. As such, all replenishments shall be directly charged 

to the expense account and at all times, the PCF shall be equal to the total cash on hand 

and the unreplenished expenses. 

 

108. Moreover, the unused balance of the PCF shall not be closed/refunded at the end of 
the year. The fund shall be closed only upon termination, separation, retirement or 

dismissal of the Petty Cash Fund Custodian (PCFC), who in turn shall refund any balance 

to close his/her cash accountability. It is also credited to recognize expenses paid out of the 

PCF but not replenished at the end of the year. 

 

109. Audit showed that PCF balance of the PCFC at the end of the year is being 
liquidated and a new set of PCF is being set up at the start of the ensuing year. Moreover, 

expenses out of the PCF which were incurred at the latter part of the year were recorded 

only when the same is being liquidated or refunded in the following year.  As a result, the 

expenses of the prior year was understated and consequently overstating the Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) account. 

 

110. The incorrect accounting treatment of the PCF balance at year-end was not only 
contrary to Section 35, Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume I, but more importantly, resulted 

in the non-availability of PCF at all times to defray emergency purchases of urgently 

needed supplies and materials. 

 

111. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 
 

a. grant and set up the PCF only once, and 
 

b. refrain from refunding unused PCF and liquidating it at year-end unless 
the PCF Custodian is due for termination, separation, retirement or 

dismissal. 
 

 AO not properly bonded 
 

112. Section 101 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that: 
 

(1) Every officer of any government agency whose duties permit or require 

the possession or custody of government funds or property shall be 

accountable therefor and for the safekeeping thereof in conformity with 

law.

(2) Every accountable officer shall be properly bonded in accordance with law. 

 

113. One (1) AO was granted a CA of ₱250,000.00 to defray pre-travel expenses for the 

first quarter of FY 2020. She was bonded in the amount of ₱225,000.00 with a maximum 

accountability of ₱500,000.00 from October 19, 2019 to October 19, 2020. We noted, 

however, that at the time of cash examination on November 3, 2020, her bond had not yet 

been renewed. 

 

114. The AO’s renewed bond was effective only from November 11, 2020 to November 
11, 2021; thus, there was a gap of 22 days which would have affected the faithful 

performance of her duties as SDO and posing the possible risks of non-recovery of loss of 

government funds in the event of a defalcation, shortage or absconding of the AO. 

 

115. Management explained that the bonds of all AOs are renewed altogether. There was 
a delay in the renewal of the bonds of the AOs because there was a delay in the signing of 

the supporting documents of the Executive Director since it had to be signed by the 

Secretary of the DSWD. 

 

116. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Administrative Unit 
to: 

 

a. monitor the validity period of the AOs’ bonds in order for the necessary 
documents to be prepared and processed within a reasonable time before 

the bonds’ expiration date; and 
 

b. segregate the application for bond renewal of the Executive Director 
from the other bond applications if there is the likelihood of a delay due 

to the processing of supporting documents, in order to avoid deferments 

in the renewal of bonds of the other AOs. 
 

 Assignment of AO without proper designation 
 

117. Paragraph 3.1.2 of the National Guidelines on Internal Control Systems (NGICS) 
issued by the DBM, through DBM Circular Letter 2008-8 dated October 23, 2008, 

discussed the Elements of the Control Environment, of which Control Policies and 

Measures are addressed.  It narrated the guidelines on the delegation of authority and 

supervision.  The delegation of authority and supervision requires a written policy which 

must be well understood by the employees concerned.  The authority has to be clear in 

terms of the particular transactions which could be acted upon by a delegate, the limitations 

in the authority, and the particular purposes for which said authority may be used.  

Assigning, reviewing, and approving an employee’s work covers tasks like, clearly 

communicating the duties, responsibilities, and accountabilities assigned to each 

Accountable Officer (AO). 

 

118. One (1) AO was authorized to hold CA with the amount of P250,000.00 through 
the issuance of Special Order (SO). The CA was to defray pre-travel expenses of the 



61 
 

Prospective Adoptive Children for the first quarter of CY 2020 which covers payments for 

passport application, visa fees, medical, plane fares, etc. Nevertheless, the same CA for 

travel expenses was used not just for the first quarter but throughout the CY 2020 period. 

Despite this, Management did not issue a subsequent SO or an amendment to the SO for 

the remaining time of the year. Management should have ensured that the AO was properly 

designated first before the continuous use of the CA. 

 

119. The assignment of an AO as SDO without proper designation would have affected 
the faithful performance of her duties and posed possible risks of non-recovery of loss of 

government funds in the instance of a defalcation, shortage or absconding of the AO. 

 

120. We recommended that Management require the Administrative Unit to 
amend the SO on the authority of the AO or issue a subsequent SO, if warranted, to 

ensure that all delegation of authority and supervision are properly documented and 

concurred with. 

 

121. Management commented that the AO has been issued SO for receiving cash 
advances for pre-travel expenses. In view of the ongoing pandemic, however, the agency 

decided that the existing SO shall remain valid. 

 

122. As a rejoinder, should the agency, henceforth, decide again to recognize and extend 
the validity of an existing SO which expressly states a specific coverage period, the same 

should be made in writing to establish proper delegation of authority and documentation. 

 

 CA disbursed not in accordance with the specific legal purpose 
 

123. Section 4.1.7 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, provides that 
“The cash advance shall be used solely for the specific legal purpose for which it was 

granted. Xxx” 

 

124. The practice of the agency with regard to the granting of CA for the purpose of pre-
travel expenses is that before the end of the year, CA would be granted to defray pre-travel 

expenses for the first quarter of the following year which will then be liquidated at the end 

of the first quarter of the ensuing year. After liquidation of the CA for the first quarter, a 

new CA would be granted to cover expenses for the remaining time of the year and the 

same will be replenished throughout the year since Management adopts the imprest fund 

system in accounting for the CA for pre-travel expenses. The said CA is required to be 

liquidated before the end of the year. 

 

125. Review thereof and replenishments of the AO revealed that the only CA granted to 
her for FY 2020 was for the purpose of covering the pre-travel expenses for the first quarter 

of FY 2020. After the lapse of the first quarter, the CA was not liquidated but was 

continuously used and replenished, which was not in accordance with Section 4.1.7 of 

COA Circular No. 97-002, which provides that a CA shall be used solely for specific legal 

purpose for which it was granted.  

 



62 
 

126. Inquiry with the Accountant was made and she explained that the need to liquidate 
the CA was overlooked since the pandemic occurred in March 2020. No other CA for pre-

travel expenses was granted to the AO because there was still a large balance at the time 

that work schedules returned, hence, the same was applied and used throughout the 

remaining period of the year. 

 

127. The disbursement of CA that is not in accordance with the specific legal purpose 

for which it was granted consequently affects the validity of the payment made thereof. 

 

128. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. direct the Accountant to monitor the CAs and ensure that these are 
promptly liquidated after completion of their purpose; 

 

b. require the AO to submit a full liquidation of her CA after completion of 
its purpose and to refund any unspent balance; and 

 

c. consider a one-time grant of CA to the AO for pre-travel expenses and 
subject the same for replenishment throughout the year, instead of 

granting twice with exactly the same purpose.  

 

129. Management commented that the Accounting Unit is consistent in verbally 
reminding the SDOs to promptly liquidate their cash advances after completion of its 

purpose and the AO has been complying with the liquidation of cash advances as soon as 

the purpose of the cash advance is completed. 

 

130. The delay in the release of the agency budget from the DBM at the beginning of 
the year will significantly affect the processing of the pre-travel documents of children if 

there is no available fund to process the same. Thus, in order to avoid any delay in the 

processing of the pre-travel documents of children, especially since prospective adoptive 

parents have fully paid for the processing of their children’s documents, the AO has been 

granted CA twice during the year. The CA will ensure that funds are available and there is 

no delay in the processing of documents especially at the beginning of the year. 

 

b) Liquidation and replenishment 
 

 Delayed liquidation of CA and Advances for Payroll of the AOs 
 

131. Paragraph 4.1.3 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides that 
“A cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the purpose for which it was given has 

been served.” 

 

132. Verification of records revealed that one (1) AO incurred delay in the liquidation 
of her CA for a special time-bound undertaking activity, contrary to the said regulation. 

The AO was granted a CA of P75,200.00 to cover expenses to be incurred in the FY 2019 

ICAB Year-end Convocation that was held on December 13 & 20, 2019. However, records 



63 
 

showed that this CA was liquidated only on June 30, 2020, which was six (6) months after 

the said activity. 

 

133. The non-liquidation of CA within the reglementary period is not in keeping with 
the established rules and regulations on the grant and liquidation of CAs. 

 

134. Likewise, Section 15, Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume I provides that “Advances 
for Payroll shall be granted to Regular Disbursing Officers for payment of salaries, wages, 

honoraria, allowances and other personnel benefits of officials and employees. The 

Advances for Payroll shall not be used for encashment of checks or for liquidation of 

previous or other types of cash advances. It shall be equal to the net amount of the 

processed payroll corresponding to the pay period. Liquidation of the advances shall be 

made within five (5) days after the end of the pay period.  Any unclaimed 

salaries/allowances shall be refunded and issued official receipt to close the account.” 

 

135. During the cash examination, another AO presented cash and cash items for 
advances for payroll amounting to P81,990.00 and P71,700.00, respectively. However, 

review of the cash advances showed that the following accounts remained unliquidated 

contrary to the prescribed period of liquidation, to wit:

136. The advances for payroll are for the payment of honorarium for meetings conducted 
by the Inter-Country Adoption (ICA) Board and Inter-Country Placement Committee 

(ICPC) members for the month. We observed that the non-liquidation of the advances for 

payroll within the reglementary period was due to conferences that were only done 

virtually, thus, no physical meetings were conducted which prevented the claimants from 

seeking the AO to claim their honorarium. The ongoing practice in place is to ask the ICA 

Board and the ICPC members for their availability and to accordingly schedule the delivery 

of the honorarium to their respective houses. Inquiry with the AO disclosed that it was 

already suggested to them to open an account with the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) 



64 
 

so that their claims could be credited directly to their accounts. They averred, however, 

that they already possess too many accounts and cards, leaving the AO no choice but to 

just continuously pay in cash which entails an additional workload.  

 

137. The non-liquidation of the advances for payroll within the prescribed period 
exposes the fund to possible risks of loss and/or misuse of government funds. 

 

138. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. require the AO to liquidate the CAs as soon as the purpose for which it 
was granted has been served; and 

 

b. reiterate to the ICA Board and ICPC members to either open an account 

with the LBP to facilitate the pay-out of their honorarium, or pay the 

honoraria through Auto Debit Arrangement (ADA) by crediting to the 

LBP account of the Cashier then transferring  to the respective personal 

bank accounts of the members through online banking channels and any 

bank service charge shall be for the account of the payees, in order to 

lessen the risk and accountabilities of the AO over cash that may be prone 

to misuse when retained for a prolonged period of time. 
 

139. The Cashier commented that the opening of LBP accounts for ICPC consultants 
was coordinated with them in the last quarter of 2020 and was supposed to be implemented 

in 2021, but the appointments of the six (6) consultants expired in the first quarter of 2021. 

He further averred that they will be coordinating with the new sets of consultants for the 

opening of accounts with the LBP. 

 

140. Moreover, the Cashier also stated that they have coordinated with the LBP East 
Avenue Branch to explore the possibility of using their Cash Card Facility to be 

implemented as soon as possible. 

 

 Disbursements incurred earlier than CA 
 

141. One (1) AO was granted a PCF of ₱50,000.00 that will serve as the agency’s PCF 
intended for its administrative and miscellaneous expenses. The said PCF was maintained 

using the Imprest System and subject to replenishment throughout the year. 

  

142. Review of the AO’s cashbook, however, revealed that several disbursements were 
incurred earlier than the grant and replenishment of the PCF, contrary to the objective of 

granting such which contemplates future or prospective expenses and not those already 

incurred. More so, these were recorded in the AO’s record on dates when the PCF had no 

more balance which resulted in negative cash balances almost throughout the year. 

 

143. According to the AO, during the times when her PCF was already used up, she and 
other employees in the agency would buy the supplies needed using their own money 

pending the receipt of a new CA or replenishment of PCF. Afterwards, when she receives 



65 
 

her CA/petty cash, she would reimburse the expenses earlier paid by her and the others.  

She then recorded the said expenses in her cashbook using the dates appearing in the 

receipts/invoices which were earlier than the date of the cash advance or replenishment 

check, thus, resulting in negative running balances in the cashbook. Said expenses should 

have been reimbursed by check, instead of charging them out of the PCF. 

 

144. Further, inquiry with the AO disclosed that the incurrence of these negative 
balances was due to the amount set for her PCF amounting to P50,000.00, implying that 

the said amount was not sufficient to cover the monthly petty operating expenses of the 

agency. Table 26 shows the average monthly disbursements derived from the AOs PCF 

record for one (1) year. 

 
Table 26. Monthly Disbursements paid out of PCF

Average monthly

₱ 42,426.07 

 

145. As can be gleaned from the table above, with an average monthly disbursement of 
₱42,426.07, the AO’s current PCF is already enough to meet a month’s worth of the 

agency’s recurring expenses with still an amount left for contingencies. In this regard, the 

prevalence of the negative balances in the AO’s record could not be attributed to the 

amount of the PCF, but on the close monitoring and proper timing of the replenishments 

made.   

 

146. We recommended and Management agreed to enjoin the AO to: 
 

a. refrain from using personal money for reimbursement of paid expenses; 
and 
 

b. properly monitor the utilization and replenishment of the PCF in order to 
maintain a sufficient amount of cash on hand that is always readily 

available for the purchase of urgently needed petty miscellaneous expenses 

as well as to avoid the incurrence of negative balances in the cashbook.

Gender and Development 

 
a PCW endorsed GAD Plan and Budget and with endorsement to DBM 

 

147. ICAB’s GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for CY 2020 was timely submitted to the 
Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) and was successfully endorsed by the latter 

to the Department of Budget and Management in compliance with the provisions set 

out under PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-001. 

 

148. Pertinent provisions of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-001 provide 
the following procedures to be undertaken, to wit: 

 

a. Section 6.1. “At least five percent (5%) of the total agency budget 
appropriations authorized under the annual GAA shall correspond to 

activities supporting GAD plans and programs. The GAD budget shall 

be drawn from the agency’s Maintenance and Other Operating 

Expenses (MOOE), Capital Outlay (CO), and Personal Services (PS). 

It is understood that the GAD budget does not constitute an additional 

budget over an agency’s total budget appropriations. 

 

b. Section 8.2.“The GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) of the agency shall 
review all submitted GPBs and as needed, provide comments or 

recommendations for revision. xxx…. The GFPS shall then submit the 

final GPBs and the corresponding GAD ARs to PCW for review and 

endorsement to DBM.” 

 

c. Section 8.5. “PCW shall acknowledge in writing receipt of the GPBs 
within two (2) working days. xxx… Upon receipt and acceptance of the 

revised GPBs, PCW shall endorse all revised GPBs and return these to 

the different line departments or central agencies for their submission 

to DBM.” 

  

149. In response to this requirement, an Annual GPB for FY 2020 was prepared for the 
formulation of organization and client-focused activities on gender-related issues/problems 

within the agency. 

 

150. Verification in the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) and 
confirmation from the PCW personnel disclosed that ICAB has submitted the GPB for CY 

2020 to the PCW for the latter’s review and evaluation. The said GPB was also confirmed 

to be accepted and approved, thus, resulting in the successful endorsement of the same to 

the DBM on February 20, 2020. 

 

151. We commended Management for the timely submission of the GPB to the 
PCW which enabled the latter to properly review and evaluate the identified priority 

gender issues and facilitate successful endorsement of the same to the DBM.  
 



67 
 

b. Delayed submission of GAD AR to COA 

 

152. The 2020 GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) was prepared, submitted and 
encoded on time in the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System; however, there 

was a delay in the submission of the said report to the audit team, which is not in 

accordance with Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001. 

 

153. Section 10 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-001 provides for the 
guidelines set relating to the preparation and submission of GAD Accomplishment Reports 

and among which states that:   

 

Section 10.1. “Attached agencies, bureaus, regional offices, constituent units 

and all others concerned shall submit their GAD ARs to their central offices. 

The agency GFPS shall prepare the annual GAD AR based on the PCW-

endorsed GPB or the GPB adjusted to the approved GAA following the form 

prescribed in Annex B. Activities completed until the end of the year may be 

included in the final GAD AR of agency submitted to PCW in January. 

 

154. Likewise, Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 set forth the responsibility of 
the audited agency in the submission of GAD GPB and GAD AR which specifically 

provides that: 

 

“Xxx Likewise, a copy of the corresponding Accomplishment Report shall be 

furnished the said Audit Team within five (5) working days from the end of 

January of the preceding year.” 

 

155. Moreover, PCW MC No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 2021 provides that the 
deadline of encoding and submission of GAD AR in the GMMS is on March 12, 2021.  

 

156. Upon inquiry with the PCW personnel on April 13, 2021, we were informed that 
the ICAB’s 2020 GAD AR was submitted and encoded in the GMMS on March 8, 2021 

which was within the prescribed timeline set in the PCW MC No. 2021-01, and as of this 

report, it is still under PCW review. 

 

157. Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 prescribes that the GAD AR should be 
provided to the audit team within five (5) working days from the end of January of the 

preceding year, hence, the submission should have been on February 5, 2021. It was only 

on April 6, 2021 or after a two-month delay, that a copy of the GAD AR was provided to 

us after several follow-ups have been made, thus, preventing the timely audit and review 

of the reported outputs and accomplishments. 

 

158. We commended Management for submitting and encoding the GAD AR in the 
GMMS within the prescribed timeline. However, we recommended and Management 

agreed to, henceforth, submit its GAD ARs to the Audit Team within the deadline 

prescribed in Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 to facilitate the timely audit 

and review of the same. 



68 
 

c. GAD budget not fully utilized 

 

159. Only ₱1,488,101.75 or 34.86% of the GAD allocated budget was reportedly 
utilized for GAD-related activities resulting in the non-implementation of the GAD 

plans and programs; thus, the benefits that could have been derived therefrom for 

the organization and the agency’s clients were not realized.  

 

160. Section 31. Programs and projects related to Gender and Development of the 
General Provisions of RA 11465 or the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of FY 2020 

provides that: 

 

“All agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development 

(GAD) plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors 

or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under RA 9710 or the 

Magna Carta of Women, Convention of all Forms of Discrimination Against 

Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-

Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan 

(2017-2022). 

  

The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, 

which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. For this purpose, 

activities currently being undertaken by the agencies which relate to GAD or 

those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment, especially 

of marginalized women, protection, promotion and fulfillment of women’s 

human rights, and practice of gender responsive governance are considered 

sufficient compliance with said requirement. Xxx.” 

 

161. Moreover, Section 4.3 of PCW Memorandum Circular (MC) 2020-03 dated April 
27, 2020 states that: 

 

“The computation of the minimum (5%) GAD Budget as provided under Section 

36(a) of the MCW shall be based on the total adjusted budget of the agency 

following National Budget Circular No. 580.” 

 

162. Based on FY 2020 GAA, ICAB had a total appropriation of P61,105,000.00 
and the budget was adjusted to P56,633,500.00 in accordance with NBC 580 re: 

Adoption of Economy Measures in the Government due to the Emergency Health 

Situation, dated April 22, 2020 and RA 11469, an Act Declaring the Existence of a 

National Emergency Arising from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) Situation.  

 

163. The GAD Budget was set at ₱4,268,800.00 or equivalent to 7.5% of the adjusted 
appropriation of ₱56,633,500.00. Out of the budgeted amount, only ₱1,488,101.75 or 

34.86% was utilized due to the observance of safety health protocols that were 

attributable to the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic resulting in the non-

implementation of the GAD plans and programs and the non-realization of the benefits 

that could have been derived therefrom for the organization and the agency’s clients. 



69 
 

 

164. We recommended and Management agreed to require the GFPS to: 
 

a. properly plan and monitor implementation of the project activities to 
ensure attainment and full delivery of expected outputs to address the 

gender-sensitive issues of the agency as well as to maximize utilization of 

GAD allocated budget; and 
 

b. adopt other alternative courses of action that are accustomed to the 
observance of the new normal to be able to still deliver the intended GAD 

activities and objectives. 
 

165. Management commented that considering ICAB’s mandate, the GFPS is still 
having a hard time in identifying and implementing GAD-related Programs, Activities and 

Projects. They also noted that the prior year’s utilization of the mandated 5% GAD budget 

was not maximized. For CY 2020, the implementation of the majority of programs was 

greatly affected by the safety health protocols issued by the government due to the 

pandemic. Alternative courses of action were implemented to attain GAD activities and 

objectives but the allotment intended was not fully utilized for the purpose. 

 

d. Reporting deficiencies in the GAD AR 

 

166. Reporting deficiencies in the GAD AR had not supported the government’s 
effort in poverty alleviation, economic empowerment, protection, promotion and 

fulfillment of women’s human rights and the practice of gender responsive 

governance, which also had not ensured accurate reporting on GAD, among others. 

 

167. PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 2021 laid out the 
guidelines in determining the actual cost/expenditure that can be attributed to a particular 

GAD activity to be reflected in the FY 2020 GAD AR: 

 
a. Section 5.0. “To attribute the expenditure of a major agency program/project 

to GAD in the FY 2020 GAD AR, agencies shall accomplish the Harmonized 

Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) Project Implementation and 

Management, and Monitoring and Evaluation (PIMME) checklist (HGDG 

Boxes 16 & 17) or the Facility Implementation, Management, and 

Monitoring and Evaluation (FIMME) checklist (HGDG Box F2), whichever 

is applicable, to assess the gender-responsiveness of the implementation of 

the program/project.” 

 

b. Section 5.2. “The score in the HGDG assessment shall be the basis in 

determining the actual cost/expenditure that can be attributed to GAD and 

reflected in the GAD AR. The percentage score of the program/project in the 

HGDG PIMME/FIMME assessment shall correspond to the percentage of 

the expenditure of the agency’s major program/project that may be 



70 
 

attributed to the GAD: Provided, that programs/projects with HGDG 

PIMME/FIMME scores below 4.0 shall not be eligible for attribution.” 

 

168. Moreover, Section 31 of RA 11465 or the GAA of FY 2020 also states that “Xxx 

Utilization of the GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance 

indicators identified by said agencies.” 

 

169. The GAD plans and programs vis-à-vis the validated GAD AR for CY 2020 with 

corresponding Audit Remarks are presented below:

170. The above table presents the GAD activities reported in the GAD AR, along with 
the accompanying schedule of GAD expenses amounting to P1,488,101.75. However, 

verification thereof showed the following deficiencies: 

 

a. Section 31 of the GAA of FY 2020 provides that the utilization of the GAD 
Budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified 

by the agencies, but review of the schedule of GAD expenses vis-à-vis GAD 

AR showed that the basis used for determining the actual cost/expenditure was 

on the identified GAD activities and not on the performance indicators. 

 

b. In relation to above Accomplishment Report submitted, a number of identified 
GAD activities were noted that: (a) had inconsistencies as to the attribution of 

GAD expenses; (b) did not address the stated GAD objective/s; and (c) did not 

relate with the fulfillment of the identified performance indicators/targets, to 

wit: 

 

i. The identified GAD Activity under Item No. 1 of the Organization-focused 
was the Annual GAD Budget Planning Workshop, however, review of the 

corresponding GAD expenses of the said activity showed that the expenses 

attributed were those that were incurred during the conduct of FY 2019 

Program Review and FY 2020 Strategic Planning Workshop. Verification 

of the agenda items of the said workshop disclosed that there was no GAD 

Budget Planning Workshop that transpired and the only notable GAD 

related matters included were the inclusion of Orientation of GAD Focal 

Point System/Review of GAD Plan 2020 and GAD Tools Analysis Training 

under the scheduled 2020 Calendar of Activities and Other Matters, 

respectively. 

 

ii. Item No. 4 under Organization-focused showed that the identified GAD 
Activity is the Continuing Systematic Capacity Building for members of the 

GFPS and TWG. Per summary of related GAD Expenses, the expenditures 

attributed for this item were those incurred from the conduct of the ICAB 

Competency Based Training in which upon verification, it was revealed that 

the topics covered and discussed for the said training were not in any way 

associated with the attainment of GAD objective and accomplishment of 

the performance indicators. 

 



75 
 

c. HGDG tool was still not being utilized in evaluating the programs, activities 
and projects for the attribution of GAD related expenditure that is to be 

reflected in the GAD AR. Upon review, all activities were not being subjected 

to an HGDG assessment in which the resulting scores should have been the 

basis in determining the actual cost/expenditure, thus, the level of gender-

responsiveness of the identified activities was not fully determined and actual 

costs were not properly attributed. 

 

Considering the various related trainings that have been already attended by the 

persons responsible in the preparation of GAD reports, the same should have 

been somehow equipped by now in adopting the HGDG as basis for assessment 

in attributing the actual costs of projects implemented during the period. 

 

171. The non-accomplishment of the planned GAD activities had not supported the 
government’s efforts in poverty alleviation, the economic empowerment especially of the 

marginalized, the protection, promotion and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and the 

practice of gender responsive governance. On the other hand, the noted deficiencies in the 

GAD AR did not reflect the agency’s actual accomplishments and expenditures for GAD, 

which could not also provide the PCW with accurate data for its reporting. 

 

172. We recommended that Management require the persons responsible in the 

preparation of the GAD AR to: 

 

a. verify the reported accomplishments and expenditures to properly 
present the activities that actually addressed GAD-related objectives and 

performance indicators; and 

 

b. carry out the preparation of the agency’s GAD AR by using the HGDG 
tool as basis for assessment in attributing actual GAD expenditures so as 

to be more accurate and reliable when it comes to the reporting of GAD 

related data. 
 

Programs for Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) 

 

173. Plans, programs and projects for senior citizens and persons with disabilities 
were not integrated in the programmed activities of the agency.   

 

174. Section 32 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for 
Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 – Programs and Projects Related to Senior Citizens and Persons 

with Disability requires that:  

 

“All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects 

intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, 

insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their 

regular activities. Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall 

provide architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will 



76 
 

reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability 

pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and R.A. No. 7277, as amended.” 

 

175. Management was unable to submit a copy of the plans and programs as well as the 
accomplishment report of the agency for Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons With 

Disabilities (PWDs). The Planning and Development Unit (PDU) informed us that they did 

not prepare plans and budget for CY 2020 for the SCs and PWDs, thus, no accomplishment 

report was also prepared for review and evaluation of projects that Management 

incorporated in their regular operations to address issues concerning the elderly and PWDs 

during the year. However, the agency conducted two (2) webinars which were attended by 

SCs and PWDs. PDU also informed us that they have employed three (3) senior citizens 

assigned in the Cashier, Records and Operations Units and one (1) PWD assigned in the 

Accounting Unit under the Institutional or Agency contract. 

 

176. The failure of the agency to integrate in its budget the plans and programmed 
activities concerning SCs and PWDs defeats the intent and purpose of legislation for which 

the law was envisioned to achieve/attain. 

 

177. We reiterated our prior years’ recommendation and Management agreed to 
formulate plans and programs intended to address the concerns of SCs and PWDs, 

insofar as it relates to the agency’s mandated function and incorporate the same in 

their regular activities. 

 

Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts 

 

178. For CY 2020, the agency has faithfully deducted from the salaries of its personnel 
the required taxes, premiums and loan installments, and remitted the same as well as the 

government share within the prescribed period to the concerned institutions or agencies, as 

summarized in Table 28.

179. We commended Management for adhering to the laws, rules and regulations 
by faithfully withholding and remitting premiums due to the BIR, GSIS, PhilHealth 

and Pag-IBIG. 

 

Hiring and payment of Job Order Personnel 

 

180. In CY 2020, the agency outsourced 17 additional workforce or 50 percent of the 34 
regular plantilla employees to provide administrative assistance. The payments of such 

services amounting to P4,534,832.71 were charged against the Maintenance and Other 

Operating Expenses (MOOE) account. 

 

 

Enforcement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 

 

181. The 2009 Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) requires 
the settlement of suspensions within 90 calendar days from receipt of the Notice of 

Suspension (NS); otherwise, the transaction covered by it shall be disallowed/charged after 

the Auditor shall have satisfied himself that such action is appropriate. Consequently, the 

Auditor shall issue the corresponding Notice of Disallowance (ND). The disallowance shall 

be settled within six (6) months from receipt of the ND by the persons liable. 

 

182. Audit disallowances found in the audit of various transactions of the ICAB as at 
December 31, 2020 amounted to P181,316.24, as shown in Table 29.
