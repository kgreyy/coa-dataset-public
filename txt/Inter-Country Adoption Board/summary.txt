EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 
A. Introduction 
 

The Inter-Country Adoption Board (ICAB) is an attached agency of the Department 

of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) mandated to be the central authority on 

matters relating to the foreign adoption placement of Filipino children and the policy-

making body for purposes of carrying out the provisions of the aforesaid law. 

 

The Board is composed of Undersecretary of DSWD who acts as Alternate 

Chairperson and six (6) other members, five (5) of whom are appointed by the President 

for a non-renewable term of six (6) years. The Board’s implementing arm is the Secretariat, 

which is headed by an Executive Director where the Operations Division and the 

Administrative and Finance Divisions are placed. 

 

To carry out its function, the Board has a workforce of 34 regular positions and 

outsourced 17 personnel through placement agency. 

     
B. Operational Highlights 

 

For CY2020, ICAB has undertaken activities and strategies to ensure Filipino 

Children are placed in suitable permanent adoptive families abroad and secured through 

monitoring and regulation of its partner agencies and ensure compliance with the standards 

and deter trafficking of Filipino children. 

 

Among its major accomplishments for the year are the following: 

 

1) Prior to the global pandemic, ICAB conducted accreditation/reaccreditation visit 
to three (3) FAAs to regulate their compliance with ICAB standards for 

intercountry adoption. One (1) USA-based FAA which was visited in 2019 was 

given re-accreditation in 2020. In view of the global pandemic, accreditation 

visits were not possible. In order to carry out its regulatory functions and for 

FAAs to continue their services, ICAB Board issued provisional authorization 

to FAAs who have been positively assessed subject to a physical validation as 

soon as foreign travel is allowed and four (4) FAAs were re-accredited. One (1) 

new FAA was also accredited. In total, ICAB accredited/reaccredited nine (9) 

FAAs for CY 2020. 

 

2) A total of 106 children were matched for intercountry adoption, among the 106 
children, 95 children were entrusted to the prospective adoptive parents. Among 

the 95 children entrusted, 40 children entrusted in the regular category, 30 

special needs children, 16 in the relative adoption and nine (9) independently 

placed children.

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial and compliance audits of the accounts and 

operations of the ICAB for the year December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) 

verify the level of assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the 

financial statements; (b) recommend Agency’s improvement opportunities; and (c) 

determine the propriety of transactions, as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent 

laws, rules and regulations; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s 

audit recommendations. 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report 
 

A qualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements of the ICAB as at 

December 31, 2020 for the misstatements of Accounts Payables account by P.248 million 

or 1.26 percent of the total liabilities and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) by P.248 million 

or 1.30 percent of the Net Assets/Equity, resulting in over/understatements of the affected 

accounts. In addition, the accuracy, existence and reliability of Inventory and PPE accounts 

are affected due to various accounting deficiencies totalling P21.137 million that were 

noted in the property and accounting records. More so, discrepancies noted between the 

Financial Statements (FSs) and Financial Accountability Reports totalling P2.781 million 

have also created an impact on the fairness of presentation of the balances of the affected 

accounts in the FSs. 

 
F. Summary of Other Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 

 

The other significant observations and corresponding recommendations discussed 

in Part II of this report, are as follows: 

 

1. Delayed submission of the BRSs ranging from approximately one (1) to six (6) 
months from month-end, contrary to Section 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume 

I impeded the timely audit and verification of BRSs; thus, corrective measures 

could not be immediately undertaken when any discrepancy/error or other 

reconciling items are ascertained, which might require adjustments by the agency. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

 

a. The Cashier to follow-up the bank statements in writing aside from the 
verbal follow-ups being made, to facilitate the receipt of the bank 

statements for bank reconciliation purposes; and 

 

b. The Accountant to monitor the receipt of the bank statements by having 
them stamped as received and indicating the dates these were actually 

obtained, as evidence that the BRS are submitted to COA within the 

prescribed period provided for in the GAM. 

 

 



 iv 

2. Disbursements totaling P0.409 million were not properly supported with complete 
documentation, thus, affecting the authenticity, validity and regularity of the 

financial transactions made out from the fund. 

 

We recommended that Management require: 

 

a. The Accountable Officers and Accountant to submit the required 
supporting documents to the Office of the Auditor to avoid suspension 

and/or disallowance; 

 

b. The Accountant to: 
 

(i) ensure that necessary supporting documents are obtained and 
complete, before processing, to support the authenticity and validity 

of the transactions; and 

 

(ii) regularly attach Certification that the previous cash advances have 
been liquidated and accounted for in the books as common 

documentary requirement for cash advances; and 

 

c. The Administrative Unit to: 
 

(i) revise the Special Order or authority of the accountable officer 
indicating her maximum cash accountability pursuant to GAM; and 

 

(ii) prepare a one-month estimate of petty expenses based on historical 
data and have it approved by the head of the Agency as basis for the 

cash advance for PCF. 

 

3. Lapses of the Accountant and Accountable Officers in the granting, utilization, 
liquidation/replenishment and reporting of cash advances (CA) resulted in 

unmonitored cash accountability at a given date and exposing the cash to possible 

risk of loss or misuse. 

 

a) Granting and utilization of cash advance 
 

 Incorrect accounting treatment of Petty Cash Fund (PCF) 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant 

to: 

 

a. grant and set-up the PCF only once; and  
 

b. refrain from refunding unused PCF and liquidating it at year-end 
unless the PCF Custodian is due for termination, separation, 

retirement or dismissal. 



 v 

 

 Accountable Officer (AO) not properly bonded 
 

We recommended that Management require the Administrative Unit to: 

 

a. monitor the validity period of the AOs’ bonds in order for the 
necessary documents to be prepared and processed within a 

reasonable time before the bonds’ expiration date; and 
 

b. segregate the application of the bond of the Executive Director from 
the other bond applications if there is the likelihood of a delay due to 

the processing of supporting documents, in order to avoid 

deferments in the renewal of bonds of the other AOs. 
 

 Assignment of AO without proper designation 
 

We recommended that Management require the Administrative Unit to 

amend the SO on the authority of the AO or issue a subsequent SO, if 

warranted, to ensure that all delegation of authority and supervision are 

properly documented and concurred with. 
 

 CA disbursed not in accordance with the specific legal purpose 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. direct the Accountant to monitor the CAs and ensure that these are 
promptly liquidated after completion of their purpose; 
 

b. require the AO to submit a full liquidation of her CAs after 
completion of its purpose and to refund any unspent balances; and 
 

c. consider a one-time grant of CA to the AO for pre-travel expenses 
and subject the same for replenishment throughout the year instead 

of granting twice with exactly the same purpose. 
 

b) Liquidation and replenishment 
 

 Delayed liquidation of CA and Advances for Payroll of the AOs 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. require the AO to liquidate the CAs as soon as the purpose for which 
it was given has been served; and 
 

b. reiterate to the ICA Board and ICPC members to either open an 
account with the LBP to facilitate the pay-out of their honorarium, 



 vi 

or pay the honoraria through Auto Debit Arrangement (ADA) by 

crediting to the LBP account of the Cashier then transferring  to the 

respective personal bank accounts of the members through online 

banking channels and any bank service charge shall be for the 

account of the payees, in order to lessen the risk and accountabilities 

of the AO over cash that may be prone to misuse when retained for 

a prolonged period of time. 
 

 Disbursements incurred earlier than CA 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to enjoin the AO to: 

 

a. refrain from using personal money for reimbursement of paid 
expenses; and 
 

b. properly monitor the utilization and the replenishment of the PCF 
in order to maintain a sufficient amount of cash on hand that is 

always readily available for the purchase of urgently needed petty 

miscellaneous expenses as well as to avoid the incurrence of negative 

balances in the cashbook.
