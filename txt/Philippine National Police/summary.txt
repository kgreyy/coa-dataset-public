EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)	Introduction



By virtue of Republic Act (RA) 6975, known as “An Act Establishing the Philippine National Police under a reorganized Department of the Interior and Local Government and Other Purposes,” a highly effective and competent police force that is national in scope and civilian in character was established in 1991. Also, as amended under RA 8551, otherwise known as the Philippine National Police Reform and Reorganization Act of 1998, the PNP was envisioned to be a community and service-oriented agency responsible for the maintenance of peace and order and public safety.



The Philippine National Police (PNP) is headed by Police General Guillermo Lorenzo T.  Eleazar as Chief, effective May 7, 2021 vice Police General Debold M. Sinas (November 10, 2020 to May 7, 2021). During CY 2020, Police General Camilo Pancratius P. Cascolan and Police General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa also held the position from September 2, 2020 to November 9, 2020 and from October 14, 2019 to September 1, 2020, respectively.



The PNP Organizational Set-up is composed of the: (a) National Headquarters (NHQ), which houses the offices of the PNP Chief and two Deputy PNP Chiefs – one for Administration and one for Operations, the Chief Directorial Staff, who acts as the chief operating officer and who coordinates, supervises and directs the 12 Directorial Staff, with the support of 14 Administrative and 15 Operational units; and (b) 17 Police Regional Offices (PROs) nationwide corresponding to the regional subdivisions of the country to include the National Capital Regional Police Office (NCRPO), PROs 1, 2, 3, 4A (CALABARZON), 4B (MIMAROPA), 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, Cordillera and Bangsamoro Autonomous Region (BAR).



The PNP Chief is also assisted by: (a)  Internal Affairs Service (IAS) to ensure the operational readiness of the police and investigate infractions of the regulations committed by members of the PNP;  (b)  the Human Rights Affairs Office (HRAO) to promote, protect and fulfill human rights thru effective institutional and policy development, capability building, prevention and control of human rights violations and multi-sectoral cooperation; and (c) Center for Police Strategy Management (CPSM) to ensure proper management and monitoring of the agency scorecard, the periodic review and evaluation, and making necessary adjustments and amendments to the strategy with support of National Advisory Group (NAG).  For police training, human resource development and continuing education, the Philippine Public Safety College (PPSC), together with the Philippine National Training Institute (PNTI), is the premier educational institution of all PNP personnel.  Also, PNTI has direct supervision and administrative control over the Philippine National Police Academy (PNPA).



For CY 2020, the manpower complement of PNP totaled to 221,419 composed of 15,666 Police Commissioned Officers (PCOs), 192,565 Police Non-Commissioned Officers (PNCOs), 1,082 CADETS and 12,106 Non-Uniformed Personnel (NUP).

C)		Scope of Audit



The audit covered the operations and financial transactions of the PNP for calendar year 2020 and the results of audit included the NHQ and the 17 PROs nationwide. 











D)		Independent Auditor’s Report



The auditor rendered a modified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements (FS) of the PNP, in view of the accounting errors which constituted 6.37 percent of total assets and accounting deficiencies as shown in the Matrix of Analysis on the Effects of Misstatement on the Financial Statements marked as Annex B.





E)		Summary of Observations and Recommendations



Among the observations and recommendations discussed in Part II of this report, the significant observations are summarized as follows:



1)	The balance of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts amounting to P36.654 Billion as at year-end is inaccurate due to the following noted deficiencies: a) a helicopter that is beyond economic repair was not dropped from the books of accounts resulting in the overstatement of Aircraft and Aircraft Ground Equipment account amounting to P325.893 million; b) items procured by “lot” amounting to P1.570 Billion were not recorded to the appropriate PPE accounts; c) various donated motor vehicles and equipment were likewise not recorded in the books which resulted in an understatement of at least P98.662 million; d) net overstatement of Land account by P2.360 million due to non-recording of titled lots and errors in recording lots without supporting documents; e) net overstatement of Work/Zoo Animals account by P6.679 million  due to unrecorded receipt and disposal of dogs; f) unrecorded transferred PPEs to various PROs amounting to P1.335 billion; g) overstatement of PPE by P33.679 million due to inclusion of items below the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00; h) unreconciled difference between accounting and property records; and i) improper maintenance of lapsing schedules for PPE; thus, affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements. (Observation No. 1)



We recommended that Management instruct the: a) Supply Accountable Officer (SAO), Special Action Force to prepare the Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) duly supported with Notice of Loss pertaining to the subject helicopter and other allied documents and promptly submit the same to NHQ Accounting Division as basis for necessary adjustment in the books of accounts; b) Accounting Division to prepare a JEV to recognize the dropping of the subject helicopter from the books and to set up receivable to record the accountability of the accountable officer;              c) Accounting Division to coordinate with concerned Office/s to identify all misclassified PPE acquired by “lot” for proper recording to the appropriate accounts and to adjust depreciation charges for each class of PPE, as necessary; d) Directorate for Logistics (DL), Makati Police Station and Supply Accountable Officer (SAO), Logistics Office to submit Deeds of Donation or equivalent document to the respective Accounting Division/Section as basis of the latter in recording donations in the books of accounts; e) DL and NCRPO K9 RECU to immediately conduct appraisal of donated equipment without cost (Annex E) and thereafter, submit the appraisal report to the Accounting Division/Section; f) NCRPO, PROs 9, 10 and 12 Accounting Section and SAOs to determine the value of land and record the same in their respective books of accounts and property records;   g) NCRPO, PROs 2, 3, 4B, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 12 to request the Regional Logistics for Research and Development Division (RLRDD) to expedite and exhaust all possible means in order to facilitate the immediate registration of lots with the Register of Deeds and ensure ownership therefor; h) PROs 2 and 9 Accounting Section to drop from their respective books of accounts the recorded lots which are not duly supported by necessary documents; i) PRO 12 Accounting Section to drop from the books the recorded lots acquired through Deeds of Usufruct and conditional MOA; j) concerned Accounting Section to disclose in the Notes to Financial Statements all lots in their possession but not yet registered under the name of PNP;  k) NHQ Accounting Division to provide copies of JEVs, together with Property Transfer Reports, to SAF as basis of the latter in recording the transferred K9 dogs; l) NCRPO K9 RECU to submit supporting documents such as MOA for Adoption and Death Certificate to the Accounting Section for the dropping of retired dogs in the books of account; m) Accounting Division to provide the PROs copies of JEVs, together with Property Transfer Reports (PTRs), as basis of the latter in recording transferred PPEs in the respective books of accounts; n) Concerned SAO: i) to use PTR (Appendix 76) for transfers from one Accountable Officer to another and Property Acknowledgement Receipt (Appendix 71) for transfers to end-users; and ii) to promptly submit copies of PTRs to the Accounting Division for recording in the books of accounts; o) Accounting Division and concerned SAOs to coordinate with the Accounting Section and RSAOs in PROs to reconcile their records with regard to discrepancies (Table 7) noted in the transfer of PPEs; p) Accounting Division/Accounting Section to prepare necessary adjusting entries to correct the misclassification of accounts; q) SAO/RSAO to use Inventory Custodian Slip (Appendix 59) for issuance of semi-expendable inventories; and r) PROs 3, 4A, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13 and COR Accounting Sections and Property Divisions to reconcile and make necessary adjustments in their respective records, as needed; s) Accounting Section of NCRPO, SAF, PROs 8, 9 and COR to: i) discontinue the roll over practice in allocating depreciation expenses from one period to another and utilize instead an updated Lapsing Schedule per fund cluster to support the charging of depreciation expenses; and ii) review the current Lapsing Schedules and regularly prepare and update them to facilitate the reconciliation against the balances recorded per books of accounts.



2)	The balance of the Cash in Bank  - Local Currency Current Account of P2.576 billion as at December 31, 2020 includes: a) balances of three unnecessary/dormant and unauthorized bank accounts amounting to P262,071.11 ; b) savings from various projects, proceeds from insurance and other income totaling ₱5.604 million which were not remitted to the National Treasury; and c) unutilized balance  of Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) amounting to ₱11.475 million transferred from  the account maintained for National Treasury, Modified Disbursement System (NT, MDS) to avoid the lapsing of  NCA. Thus, contrary to the existing rules and regulations. (Observation No. 2)



We recommended that Management instruct: a) PRO 3 and PRO 6 to close the Direct Support Fund and STL Fund accounts and remit the balances to the PNP NHQ or the Bureau of the Treasury, where necessary; b) PRO 3 to prepare DV and the corresponding check for honoraria of the BAC, if applicable, before closing BAC account and thereafter transfer the remaining balance that may be used for other expenses pertaining to activities of the BAC in the production of bidding documents to the PNP Trust Receipts Fund; and c) PRO 8 to: i) remit savings, income from rentals and other income to the National Treasury; and ii) require the Accountant to stop transferring unused NCAs to other bank accounts pursuant to Sections 4 and 6 of DBM Circular Letter 2013-12.



3)	Funds transferred by the PNP - National Headquarters to the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) for the procurement of various machinery and equipment amounting to P604.853 Million remained outstanding for more than four years, thereby undermining the objective of engaging the services of PITC and procuring the equipment. (Observation No. 3)



We recommended that the NHQ Management instruct the Directorate for Logistics (DL) in coordination with the Directorate for Comptrollership to require the PITC to refund the total unused balance from completed projects and interests, if any, for deposit to the National Treasury.



4)	The Due from National Government Agencies account with a balance of P2,143,753,857.10 as at year-end is overstated by P51.725 Million due to unrecorded reconciling items between the PNP and PS-DBM records of fund transfers which is not in keeping with paragraph 29(b) of IPSAS, Volume 1. Moreover, long outstanding balance of fund transfers to Procurement Service-DBM and National Computer Center (NCC) totaling P2.133 Billion remained undelivered with delay ranging from one to 10 years and unliquidated due to unresolved issues between the PNP and the NCC, defeating the objective envisioned in Section 7.3.3(a) of the 2016 RIRR of RA 9184. (Observation No. 4)



We recommended that Management instruct the: a) NHQ Accountant to: i)  coordinate with the concerned PS-DBM official to reconcile the variance identified between the records of the PNP-NHQ and PS-DBM; and ii) prepare necessary adjusting entries to reflect the correct balance; b) NHQ Directorate for Logistics (DL) and SAF Chief, Logistics Management Division (LMD) to demand from PS-DBM the refund of the total outstanding fund transfers for deposit to the BTr; and c) NHQ Chief, Accounting Division, Director, Information and Communications Technology Management (DICTM) and Director, Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management (DIDM) to seek an audience with NCC authorized officials to discuss remaining unresolved issues in order to settle the long outstanding balance of P140,275,000.00.



5)	The balance of the Deposit on Letters of Credit (DLC) account amounting to P4.698 billion as at December 31, 2020 is overstated by P1.350 billion due to unrecorded payments to suppliers drawn against the Deposit on Letters of Credit account of SAF. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended that Management direct the SAF Chairman, BAC and SAO to immediately submit required documents to the Accounting Section as basis in recording drawdown from the Deposit on Letters of Credit and recognition of appropriate PPE in the books of accounts.



6)	Cash Advances totaling P98.355 million remained unliquidated and outstanding at year end in violation of Section 89 of PD 1445 and Sections 5.7 and 5.8 of COA Circular 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. (Observation No. 6)



We recommended that Management of PROs 4A, 4B, 6 and 7 instruct the:         a) Disbursing Officers to liquidate outstanding cash advances and/or refund the unutilized balance within the time prescribed under Sections 5.1 and 5.7 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997; and b) Regional Accountants to monitor the grant and liquidation of cash advances and refrain from granting additional cash advance when previous ones have not yet been liquidated. 



7)	There was no proper turnover of accountabilities between outgoing and incoming accountable officers contrary to Section 77 of PD No. 1445; thus, preventing the timely audit/examination of accountabilities of Disbursing Officers (DOs), Special Disbursing Officers (SDOs)/Finance Police Commissioned Officers (PCOs)/Police Non-Commissioned Officers (PNCOs). Also, newly appointed SDOs were made to perform their duties without prior briefing by the Regional Accountant and the Auditor on matters relative to their work as required under Paragraph 6 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. (Observation No. 7)



We recommended that Management instruct: a) NCRPO to direct the Accountable Officers to: i) formalize the turnover of accountabilities by accomplishing the required Invoice and Receipt of Property; and ii) submit the cash book to the Regional Accountant in the case of AO who has ceased to act as such as required under COA Circular 97-002; b) NCRPO to conduct briefing of newly appointed accountable officers on the proper recording of transactions and other matters related to his work in compliance with Section 6.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002; and c) NCRPO and PRO 2 to direct AOs who cease to act as such to be subjected to mandatory cash examination as prescribed under par. F.2, Chapter III, of the Revised Cash Examination Manual.



8)	Lapses/gaps in internal control on cash and property management were noted such as: a) circuitous process flow of fund transfers from National Police Training Institute to Regional Training Centers; b) incorrect use of Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) and Property Transfer Report (PTR) forms; c) lack of necessary information on some PARs/PTRs; d) serial numbers are not indicated in the Delivery Receipts/Sales Invoice; and e) lacking information in the Inventory Report/Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment which is not in keeping with Section 123 and 124 of P.D. 1445. (Observation No. 8)



We recommended that Management instruct: a) NHQ concerned SAOs to: i) strictly ensure that complete details/information especially the serial numbers of PPE are indicated in the Sales Invoice/Delivery Receipt before receipt of the PPE; ii) strictly utilize the proper forms and supply the complete information required in the preparation and issuance of PARs and PTRs; and iii) strictly indicate the serial number and name of end-user in the Inventory Report/RPCPPE; and b) PRO 4A/NPTI Management to: i) require the OIC, FSO 17 to stop the practice of transferring funds from one accountable officer to another; and ii) change/modify the mode of payment of Instructor’s Duty Pay  and Training and Subsistence Allowance from granting of cash advance in the PNP-NPTI, through the Disbursing Officer, to direct remittance of funds in the RTCs/ROs Authorized Government Depository Bank.



9)	Delayed/non-submission of required financial and accounting reports, and other documents as provided under Section 100 of PD 1445 and COA Circular Nos. 95-006, 92-89E, 92-125A hindered timely review/audit of accounts and communication of results to management. (Observation No. 9)



We recommended that management direct: a) PROs 2, 6 and 12 concerned Accountants and/responsible officers to faithfully observe the prompt submission of DVs, together with supporting documents and BRS within the prescribed period; b) PRO 4B Accountant to communicate with the depositary bank and secure copies of bank statement and enroll in the bank’s online facility to be able to keep track of its balances and to update regularly the reconciliation of bank accounts; c) NHQ, NCRPO, SAF and PROs 7, 11 and 13 Management agreed to require the BAC to submit copies of perfected contracts/Purchase Orders, bidding documents and all related documents to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed period pursuant to COA Circular No. 2009-001 to afford timely review of contracts; and d) NCRPO and SAF to direct the Chief, RLMD and the SAO to submit the Notice of Acceptance (NOA) of deliveries within 24 hours from such acceptance.



10)	SAF Management has not rescinded contracts with suppliers of equipment under the Capability Enhancement Program (CEP) despite incurring delays and cumulative liquidated damages ranging from 29 to 116.30 percent equivalent to P1.011 billion of the aggregate contract amount of P1.694 billion, clearly over and above the maximum allowed liquidated damages of 10 percent as set forth in Section 68 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9184; thus, delaying the upgrade/modernization of equipment critical to the attainment of the SAF mission as envisioned under the CEP of the PNP. (Observation No. 10)



We recommended that Management direct the SAF Director to: a) instruct the Chairman, BAC to strictly adhere to the provisions of Section 68 of the Revised IRR of R.A. 9184 and Article VII of the contracts without further delay to protect the interest of the government; b) ban or blacklist delinquent suppliers from participating in future procurement projects of the agency to avoid recurrence of similar problems; and c) forfeit entire performance security bond.



11)	Unreliable Alpha List of Pensioners in the Pension Deduction and Loan Information System (PDLIS) impacted the accuracy and reliability of the payroll of pensioners due to lax implementation of monitoring mechanism resulting in: a) un-updated Alpha List of Pensioners in the Police Retirement and Benefits Units (PRBUs); b) failure to prepare and submit updated reports on losses and reports on pensioners to the PNP Retirement and Benefits Administration Service (PRBS); and c) failure to strictly monitor and properly inform some pensioners on the duties and responsibilities of their assigned active personnel-buddy, which is not in keeping with PNP Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) No. 2020-001 and PNP MC No. 2020-049. Moreover, the risk of undetected withdrawals from individual ATM accounts of pensioners under “tag and hold” status is not discounted due to lack of status report from the Land Bank of the Philippines as to the actual balance of their respective ATM accounts. There were also incidences of returned payments of pension benefits to 165 pensioners with closed/dormant accounts. (Observation No. 11)



We recommended that Management: a) instruct concerned Police Retirement and Benefits Units (PRBUs) of PROs 4B, 5, 9, 10, 13, and COR, officers and personnel to monitor strict implementation of established policies in the maintenance of alpha lists, accounting, and timely updating of pensioners in accordance with PNP SOP No. 2020-001; b) direct the PNP Retirement and Benefits Administration Service (PRBS) and PRBUs to conduct cross-matching of records with other PNP data-bases maintained by Directorate for Personnel and Records Management (DPRM), Finance Service and Information Technology Management Service (ITMS) to locate discrepancies and apply appropriate actions, if warranted; c) direct concerned personnel of the PRBU in PRO 3 to maintain updated reports on losses and reports on pensioners who are subject for deletion from the Alpha List as required in the existing guidelines in order to preserve integrity of the Alpha List of pensioners which is the source document and basis in the payment of the pension benefit; d) direct the Management of PRO 2 to ensure strict compliance of the Active Personnel-Buddy in performing their duties and responsibilities with their respective Pensioner-Buddy, as provided in PNP MC No. 2020-049 dated July 21, 2020. Require concerned officials and personnel of PRBS and FS to account pension benefits paid to unqualified pensioners and thereafter initiate recovery thereof and remit recovered amounts to the BTr pursuant to Section 10 of GAA for FY 2020; e) direct the Directors of PRBS and FS to: i) request the LBP to regularly submit a status report duly supported with statement of accounts (SOA), transaction history, and other relevant documents for all pensioners who are on “tag and hold” status to ensure that the amounts deposited to their accounts remain intact; and ii) reconcile the amounts in the account statements of pensioners on “tag and hold” status to determine total deposits versus total withdrawals, if any. In case of overpayment and/or undetected withdrawals, pursue recovery and immediately remit the amounts recovered to the BTr and submit the results of reconciliation and other relevant documents to the COA; f) consider forming a committee consisting of the heads of PNP Retirement and Benefits Administration Service (PRBS), Finance Service, Directorate for Comptrollership, Accounting Division, Information Technology Management Service and representative from PRBUs to study amendments to SOP 2020-001 particularly in deferring payment of pension benefits of pensioners on “tag and hold” status instead of releasing the pension benefits immediately to the individual ATM accounts pending verification of the actual status for control and monitoring purposes to minimize the risk of overpayment to unqualified pensioners; g) consider recording the pension benefits due to pensioners who are on “tag and hold” status under Pension Benefits Payable account pending the verification of their actual status; and h) Directors of PNP Retirement and Benefits Administration Service (PRBS) and Finance Service to immediately verify and validate the accounts of pensioners that were rejected by the LBP by notifying the pensioners of such action by the bank upon receipt of the report. If the pensioner is still qualified, expedite the deposit to the updated account. Otherwise, remit the returned amounts without valid claims deposited in the PNP Pension ATM Account to the BTr. 



12)	Deficiencies were noted in the audit of COVID funds, such as:                      a) procurements through negotiated procurement-emergency purchase amounting to P18.077 million were not duly supported with proof of posting of the Notice of Award, Contract or Purchase Order, including Notice to Proceed  in the PhilGEPS website, and at any conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in its premises; b) cash advances amounting to P500,000.00 remained unliquidated; and c) payment  of claims was not supported with complete documents contrary to the existing regulations. (Observation No. 12)



We recommended that Management direct: a) PRO 4B Regional Director (RD) to instruct the Disbursing Officer to prepare and submit the liquidation report together with its supporting documents as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served pursuant to COA Circular No. 97-002; b) PRO 5 Management to: i) instruct the Regional Accountant to require proof of posting of the NOA, contract or PO, including NTP if necessary, in the PhilGEPS website, the website of the procuring entity concerned, if available and at any conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the agency premises for all procurement amounting to more than P 50,000.00; and ii) require the BAC Secretariat to comply with the required posting of the NOA, contract or PO, including NTP if necessary, pursuant to the aforementioned provisions of RA 9184; and c) PROs 7, 8 and 13 RDs to instruct the Chiefs of the Regional Comptroller, Finance, Accountant and Disbursing Officers to ensure submission of complete and proper supporting documents to establish the validity, propriety and legality of the payments made in accordance with Section 4(6) of P.D. 1445.



13)	In PRO 5, procurement of goods through shopping amounting to P6.667 Million was not duly supported with documents required in the pertinent provisions of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184. On the other hand, End Local Communist Armed Conflict (ELCAC) funds received by PRO BAR amounting to P40 Million intended for its purpose were not obligated due to non-preparation of project activities or estimated expenses indicating the project objective and expected output caused by time constraint and late release of funds. (Observation No. 13)



We recommended that: a) Regional Accountant of PRO 5 ensure completeness of required documents before processing of all claims; b) BAC Secretariat comply with the required posting of the RFQ, NOA, contract or PO, including NTP, in the PhilGEPS website and in the website of the procuring entity concerned pursuant to the pertinent provisions of  the IRR of RA 9184; and c) PRO BAR Management prepare project activities or estimated expenses indicating project objective and expected output and ensure to utilize the funds in accordance with its intended purpose. 



		The foregoing findings and recommendations were discussed with the concerned officials of the agency during the virtual exit conference on May 6, 2021. Management’s views and reactions were considered in this report, where appropriate.
