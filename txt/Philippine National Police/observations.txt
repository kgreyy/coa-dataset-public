PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





FINANCIAL AUDIT



Deficiencies noted affecting PPE accounts



1)		The balance of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts amounting to P36.654 Billion as at year-end is inaccurate due to the following noted deficiencies: a) a helicopter that is beyond economic repair was not dropped from the books of accounts resulting in the overstatement of Aircraft and Aircraft Ground Equipment account amounting to P325.893 million; b) items procured by “lot” amounting to P1.570 Billion were not recorded to the appropriate PPE accounts; c) various donated motor vehicles and equipment were likewise not recorded in the books which resulted in an understatement of at least P98.662 million; d) net overstatement of Land account by P2.360 million due to non-recording of titled lots and errors in recording lots without supporting documents; e) net overstatement of Work/Zoo Animals account by P6.679 million  due to unrecorded receipt and disposal of dogs; f) unrecorded transferred PPEs to various PROs amounting to P1.335 billion; g) overstatement of PPE by P33.679 million due to inclusion of items below the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00; h) unreconciled difference between accounting and property records; and i) improper maintenance of lapsing schedules for PPE; thus, affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements. 



	1)	By virtue of House Bill 1197,----footnote1---- the State pursued the implementation of revitalization and Capability Enhancement Program (CEP) focused on infrastructure and facilities development as well as equipment acquisition and upgrading, in order to sustain a revitalized PNP that will continuously carry out effective policing functions and law enforcement operations, deliver timely and responsive frontline public safety services, and pursue a comprehensive and integrated approach against transnational crime and emerging forms of criminality, insurgency and serious threats to national security including terrorism.



	2)	This program is principally aimed at judicious procurement and acquisition of modern equipage for enhanced PNP capabilities which includes munitions and ordnance, firepower and weapons, transportation and mobility assets, communication, intelligence, investigative and forensic equipment.





	3)	For this purpose, PNP received a total allotment of P10,518,332,191.00 while actual procurement for CEP amounted to P8,851,697,941.57, details are as follows:

              *CY 2017 includes CEP 2016 actual procurement for three CEP items due to combination of procurement 

	4)	The conduct of audit for CY 2020 revealed the following deficiencies under the PPE account, particularly on the receipt, distribution and accounting treatment of CEP procurements for CYs 2017 to 2019, to wit:



a)	Beyond economic repair (BER) helicopter



	5)	Records showed that a Brand-New Rotary Twin Engine Aircraft (helicopter) costing P435,797,548.00 figured in an accident----footnote3---- on March 5, 2020 which rendered the same beyond economic repair.

----media/image2.jpeg----































	6)	However, the book value of P325,893,107.88 [Cost - P435,797,548.00 less Accumulated Depreciation – P109,904,440.12] of the helicopter is not yet off the books and remained recorded under Aircraft and Aircraft Ground Equipment account which is not in keeping with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 17 – Property, Plant and Equipment, Item No. 82. The standard requires an entity to derecognize the carrying amount of an item of property, viz:



82. The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment shall be derecognized:



Xxx



When no future economic benefits or service potential is expected from its use or disposal.



	7)	Similarly, Section 41, Chapter 10, Vol. 1 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) provides:



a)	When a loss of government funds or property occurs while they are in transit or the loss is caused by fire, theft, or other casualty or force majeure, the officer accountable therefore or having custody thereof shall immediately notify the Commission or the auditor concerned and, within thirty days or such longer period as the Commission or auditor may in the particular case allow, shall present his applicable for relief, with the available supporting evidence. Whenever warranted by the evidence credit for the loss shall be allowed. An officer who fails to comply with this requirement shall not be relieved of liability or allowed credit for any loss in the settlement of his accounts. (Sec. 73, P.D. No. 1445)



b)	Lost property and the related accumulated depreciation and impairment loss shall be derecognized in the books upon receipt of the Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) (Appendix 75) supported by a Notice of Lossprepared and submitted by the Accountable Officer. The loss shall be charged to account “Loss of Assets” at an amount equal to its carrying amount.



	8)	The inclusion of beyond economic repair helicopter in the regular PPE account misrepresents its non-operational condition that they continue to provide economic benefits to PNP.



	9)	Related hereto, the accountable officer was advised to submit Notice of Loss and request for relief from property accountability for the destroyed/damaged helicopter duly supported with required documents pursuant to the existing regulations.







	10)	We recommended and NHQ Management agreed to instruct the:



a)	Supply Accountable Officer (SAO), Special Action Force to prepare the Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) duly supported with Notice of Loss pertaining to the subject helicopter and other allied documents and promptly submit the same to NHQ Accounting Division as basis for necessary adjustment in the books of accounts; and



b)	Accounting Division to prepare a JEV to recognize the dropping of the subject helicopter from the books and to set up receivable to record the accountability of the accountable officer.



	11)	NHQ Management commented that the SAO, SAF already submitted the required documents/reports (i.e., RLSDDP, Notice of Loss, IIRUP, Incident Investigation Report and pictures) and that the BER helicopter was already dropped from the books by the Accounting Division under Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) No. 21-02-955 dated February 26,2021.



b)	Items procured by “lot” amounting to P1,570,143,184.96 were not recorded to its appropriate PPE accounts



	12)	PPEs amounting to P1,570,143,184.96 (Annex D) were procured by “lot” which included other PPE and non-PPE items as indicated in the Sales Invoice (SI) and Delivery Receipt (DR). The procurement by “lot” was resorted to because it was needed for the full functionality of the main equipment (e.g. computers and supplies for the Genetic DNA Analyzer), and to make it available for immediate use.  



	13)	However, accounting records showed that the cost of procured PPEs was recorded in lump amount under one account instead of apportioning the cost based on the assets acquired pursuant to in Section 8.f, Chapter 10, Volume 1 of the GAM for NGAs:



“Sec. 8. Purchase of PPE. xxx.



f.    At a lump sum price. In case the acquisition of PPE is at a “lump sum price”, the cost shall be apportioned to the asset acquired in order to have proper basis for computing depreciation. The purchase cost shall be distributed based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired.



xxx



The cost of several PPE purchased at lump sum price per set/ group/lot shall be allocated to each PPE based on the breakdown of cost reflected in the invoice, if any. In the absence of such breakdown, the allocation of cost shall be based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired.” (Emphasis supplied)



	14)	To illustrate (Table 2), 138 units of Police Rubber Boat with Outboard Motor (OBM) amounting to P178,000,000.00 were recorded as “one” item under Watercraft account. However, the SI/DR showed that the same included 20 units of laptops totaling P1,000,000.00 which should be recorded as Information and Communication Technology Equipment. Clearly, some of the procured PPEs were not recorded in the appropriate accounts.

	15)	The improper recording of PPEs (Annex D) thereby resulted in the overstatement of the Watercrafts, Technical and Scientific Equipment, Military, Police and Security Equipment, and Communication Equipment accounts of at least P1,000,000.00, P1,279,800.00, P815,490.00 and P705,500.00, respectively, and the understatement of the accounts Information and Communication Technology Equipment by P2,715,490.00; Furniture and Fixtures by P270,000.00; Semi-expendable ICTE by P194,800.00; and Computer Software by P620,500.00.



--	Improper allocation of Depreciation Expense



	16)	Related thereto, there is also improper allocation of depreciation expenses because assets were depreciated based on the lump sum amount/cost of “one” item instead of being allocated separately to the appropriate PPE accounts.



	17)	Of particular import is the rule on depreciation as provided in Paragraphs 59, 60 and 66 of IPSAS 17 – PPE, viz:



59. Each part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item shall be depreciated separately.



60. An entity allocates the amount initially recognized in respect of an item of property, plant and equipment to its significant parts and depreciates separately each such part. xxx.



66. The depreciable amount of an asset shall be allocated on a systematic basis over its useful life.



	18)	Indeed, the items are dissimilar and have different useful lives, as clearly shown in Table 2 and Annex D; thus, must be depreciated separately. 

 

	19)	It bears noting that subject PPEs were depreciated based on a “lump sum” acquisition cost which is not in keeping with Section 8.f, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs which provides:



f.  At a lump sum price. In case the acquisition of PPE is at a “lump sum price”, the cost shall be apportioned to the asset acquired in order to have proper basis for computing depreciation. The purchase cost shall be distributed based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired.



	20)	To illustrate, procured forensic comparison microscope amounting to P184,365,000.00 was recorded under Technical and Scientific Equipment account and depreciated for 10 years. However, said item includes computer which should be classified as Information and Communication Technology Equipment with estimated useful lives of five years based on the Depreciation Schedule.



	21)	The improper allocation of depreciation expense resulted in the overstatement of Accumulated Depreciation account and the understatement of Accumulated Surplus/Deficit account in the financial statements.



	22)	We recommended that the NHQ Management instruct the Accounting Division to coordinate with concerned Office/s to identify all misclassified PPE acquired by “lot” for proper recording to the appropriate accounts and to adjust depreciation charges for each class of PPE, as necessary.



	23)	The NHQ Accounting Division already coordinated with the concerned offices to identify the misclassified PPE acquired by “lot” and proper recording thereof was already made. For some items where the details are unavailable, the fair value was used to reclassify the PPEs. 



a)	Unrecorded Donations



	24)	Various donated motor vehicles, equipment and supplies with an aggregate amount of P98,661,705.00 were not recorded in the books of accounts due to non-submission of Deed of Donation as shown in Table 3.

	25)	It must be emphasized that Section 12, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs on donations without condition requires:



Cost of PPE acquired through donation without condition shall be taken up at its fair value at the date it is acquired.  All expenses incurred in connection with the donated asset, such as delivery and installation costs, shall be included in the amount recognized as asset.  The fair value of the PPE shall be recognized as Income from Grants and Donations in Kind.



	26)	Similarly, in NHQ and NCRPO, various donated motor vehicles, equipment, Narcotics Detection Dogs (NDDs) and Explosive Detection Dogs (EDDs) (Annex E) remained unrecorded as the Directorate for Logistics (DL) and K9 Section of Regional Explosive Canine Unit (RECU) failed to submit the necessary supporting documents (i.e. Deed of Donation, Appraisal, etc.) to the Accounting Division/Section. Since the values were not indicated in the Deed of Donation, a proper valuation must be conducted by the Appraisal Committee of the DL and K9 RECU to comply with the requirement set forth in Section 12, Chapter 10 of GAM.



	27)	The unrecorded donations understated the following accounts: Motor Vehicles by P11,009,106.00; Military, Police and Security Equipment by P69,049,300.00; Military, Police and Traffic Supplies Inventory by P15,592,950.00; Information and Communication Technology Equipment  by P3,010,349.00 and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit by P98,661,705.00.





	28)	We recommended that Management instruct the NHQ, NCRPO and PRO COR:



a)	Directorate for Logistics (DL), Makati Police Station and Supply Accountable Officer (SAO), Logistics Office to submit Deeds of Donation or equivalent document to the respective Accounting Division/Section as basis of the latter in recording donations in the books of accounts; and



b)	DL and NCRPO K9 RECU to immediately conduct appraisal of donated equipment without cost (Annex E) and thereafter, submit the appraisal report to the Accounting Division/Section.



	29)	Management commented that the DL, Makati Police Station and SAO, Logistics Office already submitted Deed of Donation and Appraisal Report for donated PPEs (Table 3). These donated PPEs were already recorded in the respective books of accounts of the agency except for four units of Explosive Detection Dogs in NCRPO where the appraisal report is not yet submitted.



a)	Land account issues



--	Unrecorded lands owned by police regional offices (PROs) 



	30)	Section 63 of PD 1445 mandates that all moneys and property officially received by a public officer in any capacity or upon any occasion must be accounted for as government funds and government property, except as may otherwise be specifically provided by law or competent authority. Government property shall be taken up in the books of the agency concerned at acquisition or an appraised value.



	31)	In NCRPO, PROs 9, 10 and 12, 57 parcels of land with Certificate of Land Titles and supporting documents and registered under the name of the PNP remained unrecorded in the books of accounts:

	32)	Failure to record the cost of these lots understated the Land and Accumulated Surplus/ Deficit accounts by P532,210.00. It is well to note that the reported understatement could have been higher had the assessed value of lots owned by Police Regional Offices been determined.



--	Lots without Certificates of Land Title (CLT) or supporting documents



	33)	Section 23 (2) Book V of the Administrative Code of the Philippines expressly requires any acquisition of land by agencies of the government to be evidenced by a CLT drawn in the name of the Republic of the Philippines, or such other document satisfactory to the President of the Philippines that the title is vested in the government.



	34)	However, it was noted that lots acquired through purchase, donation, presidential proclamations, executive orders and transfer from then Philippine Constabulary, were not registered in the name of the Agency.

	Included three lots valued at  P963,450.00 acquired through Deeds of Usufruct and conditional MOA were recorded in the books of accounts. However, these do not contain provision for explicit transfer of ownership to PRO 12, hence said lots should not be recognized as asset and should only be disclosed in the Notes to Financial Statements.

*Net of total recorded lots at P36,378,336.00 less P963,450.00

	

	35)	P.D. 1529, Section 51 is clear that the act of registration is an operative act to convey or affect the land, viz:



An owner of registered land may convey, mortgage, lease, charge or otherwise deal with the same in accordance with existing laws. He may use such forms of deeds, mortgages, leases or other voluntary instruments as are sufficient in law. But no deed, mortgage, lease, or other voluntary instrument, except a will purporting to convey or affect registered land shall take effect as a conveyance or bind the land, but shall operate only as a contract between the parties and as evidence of authority to the Register of Deeds to make registration.



The act of registration shall be the operative act to convey or affect the land insofar as third persons are concerned, and in all cases under this Decree, the registration shall be made in the office of the Register of Deeds for the province or city where the land lies.



	36)	Thus, the absence of absolute ownership over the lots puts the government in a disadvantage situation as it stands to lose public funds spent for the construction of police headquarters/stations in the event that future claim of ownership or right is presented by third parties, or when disposition is assailed in court by the donor themselves or their heirs.



	37)	In sum, lots recorded under Land account without Certificate of Land Title  and other supporting documents, with conditional MOA overstated the Land and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit account by P2,892,270.00.

b)	Work/Zoo Animals



--	Unrecorded receipt of K9 dogs  in SAF



	40)	Section 5, Chapter 10 of the GAM Volume I provides that PPE which qualifies for recognition as an asset shall be measured at cost. However, if PPE is acquired through a non-exchange transaction (NET), its cost shall be measured at its fair value (FV) as at the date of acquisition.



	41)	Notably, SAF received five active Explosive Detection Dogs (EDDs) costing P2,319,850.00 from NHQ which remained unrecorded in the books of accounts due to non-submission by NHQ of the Transfer-JEV, together with the Property Transfer Report (PTR), as basis of the former in recording the K9 dogs in the books of accounts.



	42)	The non-recording of K9 dogs in the books of SAF resulted in the understatement of the Work/Zoo Animals and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit accounts both by P2,319,850.00.



--	Unrecorded retired K9 dogs valued at P8,999,000.00



	43)	In NCRPO, 18 K9 dogs consisting of nine retired EDDs costing P499,950.00 each or an aggregate cost of P4,499,550.00 which were then adopted by various Police Commissioned Officers (PCOs) and Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) and nine deceased K9 dogs amounting to P4,499,500.00 were not dropped in the books of accounts.

 

	44)	Conformably with the rule laid down in General Guideline No. 6.d.5 letters b and f of PNP MC 2017-0069, deceased and adopted K9 shall be dropped from records in that:



 b. K9 death shall be immediately reported to the Chief, K9 Operations Division for endorsement to the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI). The Certification of Death from the BAI or Provincial/City/Municipal veterinarians will serve as the basis for dropping of deceased K9 from the property and accounting record.



f. All K9 adoptions will be recorded on the “Transfer of Ownership” form to be submitted to the Directorate for Logistics and Accounting Division for dropping and delisting from the property and accounting records.



	45)	In this case, the relevant documents such as MOA for Adoption, Death Certificate, among others, were not submitted by the K9 RECU to the Accounting Section to support the dropping of the adopted and deceased K9 dogs which resulted in the overstatement of Work/Zoo Animals and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit accounts by P8,999,000.00.



	46)	We recommended that Management instruct the:



a)	NHQ Accounting Division to provide copies of JEVs, together with Property Transfer Reports, to SAF as basis of the latter in recording the transferred K9 dogs; and



b)	NCRPO K9 RECU to submit supporting documents such as MOA for Adoption and Death Certificate to the Accounting Section for the dropping of retired dogs in the books of account.



	47)	NHQ Management commented that they have already provided the SAF Management with the required documents and the latter had already recorded the same under JEV Nos. 21-02-0012 dated February 26, 2021 and 21-01-0109 dated April 22, 2021. 



	48)	NCRPO Management commented that K9 RECU already submitted to the Accounting Section supporting documents such as MOA for Adoption and Death Certificates. The nine retired dogs were already dropped from the books under JEV No. 2021-04-210 dated April 29, 2021.



c)	Unrecorded transferred PPEs to various PROs 



	49)	Section 45, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs laid out the procedure in the recording of requisition and issue of PPE.



	50)	Perusal of records revealed that various equipment amounting to P1,335,569,547.00 (Annex F) were transferred to various PROs and National Support Units (NSUs) in the regions but remained recorded in the books of NHQ.



--	Transferred to PROs – P1.158 billion 



	51)	Various PPEs like Information and Communication Technology Equipment,  Technical and Scientific Equipment and Communication Equipment amounting to P1,158,415,263.00 or 86.74 percent of P1,335,569,547.00 total value of transferred PPE to PROs, remained recorded in the books of the NHQ due to non-preparation and submission of PTR by the SAO/ Responsible Supply Police Non-Commissioned Officer (RSPNCO) to Accounting Division to serve as basis of the latter in recording the same in the books of accounts.



	52)	Further, Appendix 76, Volume II of the same Manual states that: The Property Transfer Report (PTR) shall be used when there are transfers of property from one Accountable Officer/Agency/Fund Cluster to another Accountable Officer/Agency/Fund Cluster.



--	Transferred to NSUs in the PROs – P177.154 million



	53)	The PNP has 31 NSUs, 14 of which are administrative while the remaining 17 are operational in nature. Four out of 14 administrative and 10 out of 17 operational units/offices were issued with CEP items but remained recorded in the NHQ books.



	54)	At present, the practice of transferring PPEs by the NSUs to the regional support units (e.g. HPG -HQ to Regional Highway Patrol Unit (RHPU)) using PAR is centrally recorded in the books of accounts of the NHQ. However, actual custody of the same is in the ROs.



	55)	Section 7, IPSAS, Volume I define assets as, resources controlled by an entity as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits or service potential are expected to flow to the entity.



	56)	Various PPEs amounting to P177,154,284.00 or 13.26 percent of P1,335,569,547.00 total value of transferred PPEs to PROs, were transferred by NSUs to regional support units. 



	57)	Considering that the actual custody and control of subject PPEs as well as the benefits are already transferred to the PROs, it is more ideal/proper that the transfer of equipment be recorded in the PROs’ respective books of accounts for proper control and monitoring of property accountability.



	58)	The current practice provides difficulty in monitoring accountability and whereabouts of equipment.



--	Transferred PPE to end-users in the PROs using PARs



	59)	Of the P42,165,765.00 total value of transferred Information and Communication Technology Equipment (ICTE) to PROs, the RSPNCO of Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management (DIDM) transferred ICTE amounting to P21,038,080.00 through the issuance of Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) to end-users of PROs instead of PTR. 



	60)	Appendix 71, GAM for NGAs Volume II states that: The PAR shall be used in the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to record the issue of PPE to end-user. It shall be maintained by fund cluster. It shall be renewed every three years or every time there is a change in custodianship/user of the property.



	61)	While the use of PAR in this instance is proper since ICTE were issued to end-users, it was however noted that these end-users are detailed in various PROs. Thus, for proper accounting and monitoring of accountability, it is more appropriate that the transfer of ICTE be issued first by RSPNSO, DIDM to the respective SAOs of PROs using PTR; and thereafter, for the latter to issue the ICTE to end-users using PAR.



	62)	The non-recording of transferred PPEs in the PROs books of accounts affects the accuracy of reported PPE balances in the respective financial statements while the accounts in the financial statements of the NHQ were overstated by:

--	Discrepancies in items received by PROs 



	63)	Section 15, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs Volume 1, states that: The FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity.  Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSAS.  The application of PPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.



	64)	Comparison of records pertaining to transfers made by NHQ vis-à-vis receipt of items in PROs showed discrepancies in terms of quantity as shown in Annex G and summarized in Table 7.

	65)	The evident discrepancies between the NHQ and PROs open an avenue for misapplication and possible loss of subject PPEs and accuracy of balances in respective financial statements of PNP offices.



	66)	We recommended that Management instruct the NHQ:



a)	Accounting Division to provide the PROs copies of JEVs, together with Property Transfer Reports (PTRs), as basis of the latter in recording transferred PPEs in the respective books of accounts;



b)	Concerned SAO:



i)	to use PTR (Appendix 76) for transfers from one Accountable Officer to another and Property Acknowledgement Receipt (Appendix 71) for transfers to end-users; and



ii)	to promptly submit copies of PTRs to the Accounting Division for recording in the books of accounts;



c)	Accounting Division and concerned SAOs to coordinate with the Accounting Section and RSAOs in PROs to reconcile their records with regard to discrepancies (Table 7) noted in the transfer of PPEs. 



	67)	NHQ Management commented that the transferred Technical and Scientific Equipment to PROs were already recorded under JEV No. 21-01-307 dated January 29, 2021. For Information and Communication Technology Equipment, partial compliance was already made as to the replacement of PARs with PTRs. 



	68)	For transfer to NSUs, the Accounting Division (AD) commented that they are only following the current practice and thus, PPEs are recorded in the NHQ books of accounts. However, due to tedious monitoring of subject PPEs, the Acting Chief, AD suggested to the Directorate for Logistics (TDL) to establish a policy that will govern issuance of equipment to NSUs. The Directorate for Logistics cited technicalities associated to some NSUs and that the crafting of the new policy and the eventual implementation of transfer to PROs will take some time. 



	69)	For discrepancies in PPE items received by PROs under CEP procurements, coordination was already made between the Accounting Division/Accounting Section and RSAOs for reconciliation of records. 







d)	Overstatement of PPE due to inclusion of items below the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00



	70)	Section 10, Chapter 8 of the same Manual provides:



Tangible items below the capitalization threshold of P15,000 shall be accounted as semi-expendable property. The following policies apply as follows:

a)	Semi-expendable property which were recognized as PPE shall be reclassified to the affected accounts.



b)	These tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon issue to the end-user.



	71)	Various semi-expendable equipment with an aggregate cost of P28,557,797.71 (Table 8) were recorded as PPE and issued to end-user using PAR.

	72)	The semi-expendable equipment must be issued using the Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) as required under Appendix 59, Volume II of the same Manual which provides: The ICS is a form used by the Supply and/or Property Custodian to issue tangible items amounting to less than P15,000.00 to end-user to establish accountability over them.



	73)	The misclassification of items overstated the PPE and the Accumulated Surplus/ Deficit accounts by P33,679,456.26. The Accumulated Surplus/Deficit is used instead of Semi-Expendable Information and Communication Technology Equipment since these items were already issued (expense) to end-users as evidenced by PARs. Needless to say, the issuance of PAR (Appendix 71) is not proper and the same must be replaced with ICS (Appendix 59).



	74)	We recommended that Management require the NHQ and PROs 9 and 11:



a)	Accounting Division/Accounting Section to prepare necessary adjusting entries to correct the misclassification of accounts; and



b)	SAO/RSAO to use Inventory Custodian Slip (Appendix 59) for issuance of semi-expendable inventories.



	75)	NHQ Management commented that they have already reclassified semi-expendable properties previously recorded as PPEs to its appropriate Semi-Expendable accounts recorded under various JEVs. On the other hand, PROs 9 and 11 agreed with COA’s recommendation.



e)	Unreconciled variance between the accounting and property records



	76)	Comparison of the RPCPPE and the accounting records showed a variance of P1,280,100,802.37 (Annex H) and summarized in Table 9.

	77)	The non-reconciliation of balances per accounting and property records casted doubt on the accuracy of reported PPE balances as of December 31, 2020, which consequently affected the fair presentation of the Statement of Financial Position.



	78)	We recommended that PROs 3, 4A, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13 and COR Accounting Sections and Property Divisions to reconcile and make necessary adjustments in their respective records, as needed. 



	79)	Management commented the following:



Office

Comments

PROs 3 

The RSAO in coordination with the Regional Accounting Office (RAO) will make necessary adjustments on the noted difference once the said transfer forms were received.  



PRO 4A

Except for firearms, the discrepancies noted as of December 31, 2020 amounting to P132,334,946.55 affecting five (5) PPE accounts were established and adjustments were already made in the property books as of March 31, 2021.



PRO 5

All the noted discrepancies between the accounting records and RPCPPE were already reconciled and adjusted as of September 30, 2020.



PRO 6

PRO 8

RSAO will make the necessary adjustments in its records.



PRO 12

RSAO and Accounting Section reconciled their records and the latter adjusted its books of account and recorded deficiencies noted under various JEVs.



PRO 13

Reconciliation of Property and Accounting records for PPE is on-going.



PRO COR

Recorded Land account in the books of accounts is already reconciled with the RPCPPE. Reconciliation of Military, Police and Security Equipment and Motor vehicles accounts is still on-going.



f)	Improperly maintained PPE Lapsing Schedules



	80)	Sections 111 and 112 of PD No. 1445 categorically provide that the accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.



	81)	As at December 31, 2020, PNP has a total PPE of P36,653,770,433.43.



	82)	The total cost of PPE accounts and its Accumulated Depreciation for NCRPO, SAF, PROs COR, 8 and 9 as at year-end are as follows:

	83)	A perusal of the Lapsing Schedule maintained by the Accounting Section disclosed various errors and omissions on PPE accounts which are primarily caused by the improper maintenance of lapsing schedules.



	84)	Lapsing Schedule refers to a working paper that lists in detail the items of property and equipment including, among others, the cost, acquisition date, residual value, and estimated useful life. It is the basis of the Accounting Section in the computation of periodic depreciation charges and accumulated depreciation together with the respective total cost of each class of PPE. 



	85)	Comparison of the balances of Depreciation Expenses for CY 2020 per Lapsing Schedules and per Accounting Section records of NCRPO and PRO COR disclosed a variance of P39,715,487.98 as presented in Annex K. Likewise, there is also an unreconciled difference of P1,592,432,111.58 (Annex L) between the balances of PPE in the Statement of Financial Position (SFPos) and in the Lapsing Schedules of NCRPO, PROs COR and 9.



	86)	In SAF and PRO 8, perusal of accounting records revealed that the lapsing schedules were not properly prepared and maintained. Moreover, there were no lapsing schedules for Construction in Progress  – Buildings and Other Structures in PRO 9 while Land Improvements, Information and Communication Technology Equipment, Communication Equipment, Military, Police and Security Equipment, and Motor Vehicles in PRO COR . It is well to note that failure to prepare Lapsing Schedule casted doubts on the accuracy of computation of Depreciation Expenses. 



	87)	The improperly maintained and unprepared lapsing schedules and lack of other relevant data that should have been provided therein effectively hindered the Audit Team (AT) from reperforming computation of actual Depreciation Expenses; thus, the effects of the above omissions and deficiencies in the financial statements are difficult to assess.



	88)	It was gathered that in recording the current year’s (CY’s) depreciation, the Accounting Section relies on the prior year’s (PY’s) recorded depreciation expense and reflects adjustments based on any additions and disposals of PPE items during the year. However, the use of roll-over approach method instead of the lapsing schedule, is problematic and may cause material misstatements in the financial statements due to the following risks:

	

--		The PY’s amount used as basis may not be accurate at all since it is not based on lapsing schedules;

--	It does not provide relevant information as to acquisition cost, acquisition date, useful life in years, etc.;

--	It cannot likewise provide information as to the residual values and depreciable cost of all PPE items;

--	No breakdown is available as to the details of depreciation. Moreover, the Accounting Section cannot provide information as to the breakdown of depreciation per line item of PPE;

--	It cannot determine whether an item of PPE is already fully depreciated; thus, may overstate the amount of depreciation recognized per item;

--	The PY’s amount may have been computed based on an incomplete list of PPEs, otherwise said, not all items of PPE may have been subjected to depreciation; and

--	Reclassifications from one PPE account to another may not have been considered.



	89)	In view of the low integrity of the method used by the Accounting Section concerned and the non-reconciliation of balances per financial statements and Lapsing Schedules, the accuracy and valuation of the reported Depreciation Expenses in the Agency’s Statement of Financial Performance and consequently, the balances of the Accumulated Depreciation accounts of PPEs are rendered unreliable.



	90)	We recommended that Management direct the Accounting Section of NCRPO, SAF, PROs 8, 9 and COR to:



	a)	discontinue the roll over practice in allocating depreciation expenses from one period to another and utilize instead an updated Lapsing Schedule per fund cluster to support the charging of depreciation expenses; and



	b)	review the current Lapsing Schedules and regularly prepare and update them to facilitate the reconciliation against the balances recorded per books of accounts.



	91)	Management commented the following:



Office

Comments

NCRPO and SAF

The Accounting Section made a representation request for the reassignment of one Accountant from SPD to NCRPO and SAF, who will handle reconciliation and preparation of lapsing schedule of PPE of both NCRPO and SAF. The said request was approved and the lapsing schedules are presently under reconciliation and for updating to address improper depreciation and recording of balances. 



PRO 8

The Accountant shall prepare the required Lapsing Schedules when complete, reliable and timely reports and supporting documents are received from the RSAO. 

PRO 9

Management has started migrating from the practice of rolling over the depreciation expense and utilizing the Lapsing Schedules of Depreciation Expenses of PPE to support the charging of depreciation expenses. They also commit to regularly update and facilitate reconciliation of balances.



PRO COR

The Accounting Section of the Regional Comptrollership Division has already prepared Lapsing Schedules. Correspondingly, depreciation expenses will be adjusted due to submission and updating of lapsing schedules.













Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account (CIB-LCCA)



1)	The balance of the Cash in Bank  - Local Currency Current Account of P2.576 billion as at December 31, 2020 includes: a) balances of three unnecessary/dormant and unauthorized bank accounts amounting to P262,071.11 ; b) savings from various projects, proceeds from insurance and other income totaling ₱5.604 million which were not remitted to the National Treasury; and c) unutilized balance  of Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) amounting to ₱11.475 million transferred from  the account maintained for National Treasury, Modified Disbursement System (NT, MDS) to avoid the lapsing of  NCA. Thus, contrary to the existing rules and regulations.  



a)	Unnecessary/Dormant bank accounts 



1)	COA Circular 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015, in conformity with Permanent Committee JC No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012, prescribes the guidelines and procedures in the reversion to the General Fund of all dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds maintained by NGAs with depository banks.



2)	In PRO 3, verification of three bank accounts maintained with the LBP revealed the following:

3)	Likewise, in PRO 6, the bank account maintained for PCSO Small Town Lottery (STL) with zero balance is no longer necessary since PCSO STL Fund is directly remitted to the PNP-NHQ bank account.



4)	The maintenance of these bank accounts runs counter to the above-mentioned regulations on reversion of all dormant accounts and unnecessary special and trust funds to the General Fund.





b)	Unremitted savings from various projects, insurance proceeds and income



5)	As a general rule, all fees, charges, assessments, and other receipts or revenues collected by departments, bureaus and offices of the NG, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy in the exercise of their mandated functions, at such rates as are now or may be approved by the appropriate approving authority shall be deposited to the National Treasury as income of the GF pursuant to Section 44, Chapter 5, Book VI of E.O. 292, s. 1987 and Section 65 of P.D. No. 1445.----footnote5----



6)	The coverage of insurance proceeds is discussed in Section 2.0 of NBC No. 342 and COA Circular No. 81-160, viz:



Coverage – insurance proceeds referred to in this circular include all insurance proceeds received on damaged/lost national government property such as inventories, land improvements, buildings and structures, furniture, equipment and work animals of national government agencies.



7)	Notably, in PRO 8, the Trust Fund account includes proceeds from GSIS insurance, receipts of various collections, and savings from projects implemented by the agency such as income from disposal of beyond economic repair (BER) properties, collections from concessionaires, collection from issuance of vehicle decals, rental income and collections from violation of camp rules totaling ₱5,604,186.94 (Table 14) which should be remitted to the National Treasury.

10)	We recommended that Management instruct the:



			a)	PRO 3 and PRO 6 to close the Direct Support Fund and STL Fund accounts and remit the balances to the PNP NHQ or the Bureau of the Treasury, where necessary;



	c)	PRO 3 to prepare DV and the corresponding check for honoraria of the BAC, if applicable, before closing BAC account and thereafter transfer the remaining balance that may be used for other expenses pertaining to activities of the BAC in the production of bidding documents to the PNP Trust Receipts Fund; and

PRO 8

Management will remit to the National Treasury savings, income from rentals and other income as soon as the Office Primarily Responsible (OPR) prepares the DV and other supporting documents duly approved by the Regional Director (RD).





Undelivered equipment by PITC



2)	Funds transferred by the PNP - National Headquarters to the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) for the procurement of various machinery and equipment amounting to P604.853 Million remained outstanding for more than four years, thereby undermining the objective of engaging the services of PITC and procuring the equipment. 



	1)	The PNP has been using the agency-to-agency mode of procurement by engaging PITC, as a servicing agency, to undertake its procurement as authorized under Section 7.3.3 (a) of the Revised IRR of RA 9184, to wit:



7.3.3. In order to hasten project implementation, Procuring Entities which may not have the proficiency or capability to undertake a particular procurement, as determined by the HoPE concerned, may outsource the procurement tasks by:



a) Requesting other GoP agencies to undertake such procurement for them, through the execution of a memorandum of agreement containing specific arrangements, stipulations and covenants, in accordance withgovernment budgeting, accounting and auditing rules; xxx



	2)	In CY 2016, PNP transferred a total of P1,347,616,452.90 to PITC for the procurement of mobility, firearms and other equipment. However, P604,853,120.00 of which remained undelivered even after the lapse of more than four years, contrary to the objective of the above-mentioned regulation. Details are shown below:

	4)	We recommended that the NHQ Management instruct the Directorate for Logistics (DL) in coordination with the Directorate for Comptrollership to require the PITC to refund the total unused balance from completed projects and interests, if any, for deposit to the National Treasury.



	5)	The DL commented that the outstanding PNP-PITC projects are already undergoing post-qualification and for issuance of notice of award (NOA). Coordination with PITC is underway to inquire possible causes of delay in the procurement.



Unliquidated Fund Transfers (FTs) to PS-DBM and NCC



3)	The Due from National Government Agencies account with a balance of P2,143,753,857.10 as at year-end is overstated by P51.725 Million due to unrecorded reconciling items between the PNP and PS-DBM records of fund transfers which is not in keeping with paragraph 29(b) of IPSAS, Volume 1. Moreover, long outstanding balance of fund transfers to Procurement Service-DBM and National Computer Center (NCC) totaling P2.133 Billion remained undelivered with delay ranging from one to 10 years and unliquidated due to unresolved issues between the PNP and the NCC, defeating the objective envisioned in Section 7.3.3(a) of the 2016 RIRR of RA 9184.



1)	The balance of the Due from National Government Agencies account amounting to P2,143,753,857.10 as of December 31, 2020 pertained to fund transfer (FT) to other NGAs as follows:

Appendix A of the same PPSAS defines reliable information as free from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.



3)	The account Due from National Government Agencies - PS–DBM has a balance of P1,988,448,433.53 arising out of funds transferred to PS for the procurement of ammunitions, office supplies, various equipment and others which remained undelivered or unliquidated for a period ranging from one to 10 years.

The funds were included in the cash swept by the BTr used for the implementation of the Social Amelioration Measures to address the COVID-19 emergency.

b)	Long outstanding fund transfers to PS–DBM and NCC



--	Procurement Service - DBM



10)	Section 7.3.3 (a) of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184 states that, in order to hasten project implementation, Procuring Entities which may not have the proficiency or capability to undertake a particular procurement, as determined by the HoPE concerned, may outsource the procurement tasks by: a) Requesting other GoP agencies to undertake such procurement for them, through the execution of a memorandum of agreement containing specific arrangements, stipulations and covenants, in accordance with government budgeting, accounting and auditing rules.



11)	In NHQ, the fund transfer to PS-DBM has a balance of P3,822,352,389.37 as of December 31, 2019 consisting of undelivered common-use supplies, assault rifle, pistol, radios, various items/equipment, etc.



12)	In CY 2020, the PS – DBM was able to deliver surgical gown, firearms, etc. amounting to P1,834,272,804.14 or 48 percent out of P3,822,352,389.37 outstanding balance. However, the undelivered items amounting to P1,988,448,433.53 or 52 percent are still significant. 



13)	Notably, P830,138,227.50 [P829,882,787.51 + P255,439.99] or 41.75 percent pertained to fund transfers which have been long outstanding for more than five years as shown in Table 15. 



14)	Likewise, in SAF, 909 sets of Caliber .40mm High Explosive Dual Purpose Ammunition with total cost of P4,089,510.84 remained undelivered for more than four years.



15)	The considerable delay in the procurement action of PS-DBM defeats the very purpose of tapping the services of PS-DBM which is “to hasten project implementation.” This hinders the immediate use of the equipment as well and unnecessarily prevents PNP from efficiently and effectively carrying out its mandate.



--	National Computer Center (NCC)



16)	The outstanding balance of P140,275,000.00 pertains to funds transferred to NCC for the implementation of National Crime Information System (NCIS) which remained unimplemented and outstanding for more than 10 years due to unresolved issues between the PNP and the NCC.



17)	This has been the subject of audit observations reported in previous years’ consolidated AAR. The non-acceptance by PNP of the equipment was due to noted deficiencies as follows:



a)	NCIS Equipment need more enhancement and were already outdated;



b)	Technical assessments made by Amellar Solutions, Inc., a private company commissioned by the Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management to determine the equipment capability, revealed that the system was flawed and incapable of processing crime information; and



c)	The contract entered into by the NCC for the procurement of NCIS equipment was overpriced and perfected even without the approval of the Office of the President (OP).



18)	According to NHQ Management, a meeting was held last May 2, 2019 with the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) to discuss the issues. Both sides agreed to set a formal meeting with concerned officials of both agencies and their respective auditors to resolve the issues.



19)	However, we deem it necessary to reiterate this issue as the matter remains unresolved. 



20)	We recommended that Management instruct the:



a)	NHQ Accountant to:



i)	coordinate with the concerned PS-DBM official to reconcile the variance identified between the records of the PNP-NHQ and PS-DBM; and 



ii)	prepare necessary adjusting entries to reflect the correct balance;



b)	NHQ Directorate for Logistics (DL) and SAF Chief, Logistics Management Division (LMD) to demand from PS-DBM the refund of the total outstanding fund transfers for deposit to the BTr; and



c)	NHQ Chief, Accounting Division, Director, Information and Communications Technology Management (DICTM) and Director, Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management (DIDM) to seek an audience with NCC authorized officials to discuss remaining unresolved issues in order to settle the long outstanding balance of P140,275,000.00.



21)	Management of NHQ commented that the AD already reconciled its records with PS-DBM and reconciling items were already recorded in the books of accounts. In addition, Memorandum dated April 5, 2021 was sent to Chief, Supply Management Division re: long outstanding FTs to PS-DBM with a total amount of P1.988B requesting coordination/reconciliation with PS-DBM to determine possible causes by APRs. On the issue of NCC balance, letter dated April 8, 2021 was sent to the Undersecretary for Legal Affairs, Policy, Planning and Finance of the DICT, the agency which absorbed NCC, requesting for the current status of the equipment in their custody.



Unrecorded payments drawn against Deposit on Letters of Credit



1)		The balance of the Deposit on Letters of Credit (DLC) account amounting to P4.698 billion as at December 31, 2020 is overstated by P1.350 billion due to unrecorded payments to suppliers drawn against the Deposit on Letters of Credit account of SAF. 



1)	Section 27 of IPSAS 1 and Section 15, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I provides that the FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definition and recognition criteria of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out in IPSAS 13, Chapter 8 of GAM Volume I which states that: Physical count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship.



2)	As of December 31, 2020, the Statement of Financial Position revealed a balance of P2,723,673,233.79 for Deposit on Letters of Credit (DLC) account of SAF. DLC pertains to opened letters of credit with the LBP - International Trade Management for various procurement of equipment under the CEP of SAF. Details are presented in Annex M.



3)	However, confirmation from Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) disclosed that projects with DLC with an aggregate amount of P1,350,114,669.10 were already accepted by the agency and were issued with Certificates of Final Acceptance; thus, the related DLCs were likewise endorsed to the LBP for payment to respective suppliers. Summary of released DLCs per BAC is presented in Annex N. 



4)	The negotiated DLCs remain unrecorded in the books of account as a result of non-submission of the following documents by concerned officials evidencing delivery, acceptance, and payment to the Accounting Section for recording purposes:



a)	Application of Payment made by the bank;

b)	Sales Invoice;

c)	Delivery Receipt;

d)	Beneficiary’s signed draft;

e)	Payment Advice;

f)	BAC Resolution of Acceptance;

g)	Inspection and Acceptance Report.



5)	The non-recording of payments made to suppliers drawn against the DLC account of PNP-SAF resulted in the overstatement of Deposit on Letters of Credit amounting to P1,350,114,669.10 and the understatement of the cost of related PPE accounts for the same amount. The Audit Team also emphasized the effect of non-recording of PPE account in the computation of Depreciation Expenses. 



6)	We recommended that Management direct the SAF Chairman, BAC and SAO to immediately submit required documents to the Accounting Section as basis in recording drawdown from the Deposit on Letters of Credit and recognition of appropriate PPE in the books of accounts.



7)	SAF Management commented that required documents for DLC were already submitted by the BAC to the Accounting Section and the same were recorded in the books of account under various JEVs.



Unliquidated Cash Advance (CA) 

	

1)	Cash Advances totaling P98.355 million remained unliquidated and outstanding at year end in violation of Section 89 of PD 1445 and Sections 5.7 and 5.8 of COA Circular 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. 



1)	Section 89 of PD No. 1445 states that: No cash advance shall be given unless for a legally authorized specific purpose.  A cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served. No additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.



2)	Section 5.1 of COA Circular 97-002, on the other hand, mandates the Accountable Officers to liquidate cash advances as follows:



5.1.1 	Salaries, wages, etc. - within five (5) days after each fifteen (15) day/end of the month pay period.



5.1.2 	Petty Operating Expenses and Field Operating Expenses- within twenty (20) days after the end of the year; subject to replenishment as frequently as necessary during the year.



3)	Likewise, Section 5.7 of the same Circular provides that a cash advance must be returned or refunded immediately to the Collecting Officer when it is no longer needed or has not been used for a period of two months. 



4)	At year-end, cash advances (CAs) in PROs 4A, 4B, 6 and 7 amounting to P98,355,146.63 remained unliquidated as shown in Table 19.

Total

98,355,146.63





5)	Moreover, accountable officers (AOs) were granted additional CAs even though previous ones have not yet been settled nor a proper accounting was made; thus, resulting in the accumulation and overlapping of CAs held by Disbursing Officers (DOs). 



6)	The PRO 6 Regional Accountant reasoned the urgency of service in granting additional CAs even if previous CAs of AOs have not yet been liquidated. 



7)	Notably, P13,852,613.11 out of P98,355,146.63 pertained to CA for intelligence funds of which P7,819,502.00 granted in CYs 2011 to 2014 were already liquidated and submitted to the COA – Intelligence and Confidential Fund Audit Unit (ICFAU) awaiting issuance of Credit Notice.



8)	The non-liquidation of CAs resulted in huge amount of cash in the hands of some DOs at year-end; thereby, exposing government funds to risk of loss, when not properly safeguarded.



9)	We recommended that Management of PROs 4A, 4B, 6 and 7 instruct the:



a)	Disbursing Officers to liquidate outstanding cash advances and/or refund the unutilized balance within the time prescribed under Sections 5.1 and 5.7 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997; and



b)	Regional Accountants to monitor the grant and liquidation of cash advances and refrain from granting additional cash advance when previous ones have not yet been liquidated.

Deficiencies in cash management



2)		There was no proper turnover of accountabilities between outgoing and incoming accountable officers contrary to Section 77 of PD No. 1445; thus, preventing the timely audit/examination of accountabilities of Disbursing Officers (DOs), Special Disbursing Officers (SDOs)/Finance Police Commissioned Officers (PCOs)/Police Non-Commissioned Officers (PNCOs). Also, newly appointed SDOs were made to perform their duties without prior briefing by the Regional Accountant and the Auditor on matters relative to their work as required under Paragraph 6 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. 



--	No proper turn-over of accountabilities



1)	Section 77 of P.D. No. 1445 provides that, when government funds or property are transferred from one accountable officer to another, or from an outgoing officer to his successor, it shall be done upon properly itemized invoice and receipt which shall invariably support the clearance to be issued to the relieved or out-going officer, subject to regulations of the Commission.



2)	In NCRPO, there was change in Disbursing Officer (DO) but no proper turnover of accountability by the outgoing DO as evidenced by the absence of properly accomplished Invoice and Receipt of Property as required under Section 77 of PD No. 1445. 



3)	Likewise, there was no proper transfer of funds and property for 88 other outgoing and incoming accountable officers (AOs) (Annex O). Moreover, AOs’ final reports of accountability and cashbooks or its equivalent were not submitted to the Regional Accountant upon ceasing to act in their official capacity.



4)	Failure to implement the above-mentioned provision resulted in difficulty in establishing AOs’ accountabilities and the lack of sufficient basis for issuance of clearances to outgoing AOs.  



--	Inadequate training of designated AO 



5)	Paragraph 6.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002 states that, a newly appointed or designated accountable officer shall start with a new cashbook. Before discharging his duties, the new accountable officer shall be briefed by the Accountant and the Auditor on the proper recording of the transactions and other matters related to his work.



6)	In NCRPO, the newly designated AO was made to perform his duties without prior briefing by the Regional Accountant and the Auditor on matters relative to his work in violation of Paragraph 6.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002. 



7)	Moreover, 266 DOs, SDOs, and Finance PCOs/PNCOs from different Police Districts, Police Stations, Mobile Force Battalions and Presidential PNP Support Force Unit in NCRPO assumed office as AOs, thereby violating Paragraph 6.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002. This number includes 235 newly designated AOs under new scheme where MOOE funds are directly credited to the Police Community Precincts and Police Sub-Stations. 



--	Failure to inform the Office of the Auditor on the termination of AO



8)	Paragraph F.2, Chapter III of the Revised Cash Examination Manual  provides for circumstances when a mandatory cash examination shall be performed:

9)	In NCRPO and PRO 2 there were AOs whose functions were already terminated due to transfer/reassignment; however, the Office of the Auditor were not informed of the same, thus, precluding the latter to conduct examination on the cash and accounts of the outgoing AOs prior to transfer. 



10)	Moreover, in NCRPO, the AO failed to submit the cash book to the Regional Accountant in violation of Paragraph 6.5 of COA Circular 97-002, which provides, when the accountable officer ceases to be one, the cashbook shall be submitted to the Accountant and shall form part of the accounting records. No clearance shall be issued to an accountable officer if he fails to submit the cashbook as required.



11)	Cash examination is an indispensable audit procedure prior to the separation or actual transfer of an AO, to ascertain that all funds and properties under his/her custody were properly accounted and turned over to the appropriate agency official/employee. 



12)	We recommended that Management instruct the:



a)	NCRPO to direct the Accountable Officers to:



		i)	formalize the turnover of accountabilities by accomplishing the required Invoice and Receipt of Property; and



		ii)	submit the cash book to the Regional Accountant in the case of AO who has ceased to act as such as required under COA Circular 97-002; 



b)	NCRPO to conduct briefing of newly appointed accountable officers on the proper recording of transactions and other matters related to his work in compliance with Section 6.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002; and



c)	NCRPO and PRO 2 to direct AOs who cease to act as such to be subjected to mandatory cash examination as prescribed under par. F.2, Chapter III, of the Revised Cash Examination Manual. 



13)	NCRPO Management commented that RFSO 16 in cooperation with Chief, Accountant and his Accounting staff conducted a 4-day Lecture Seminar on February 2-4 which was attended by SDOs/Finance PNCOs. Accordingly, the guidelines on CA fundamental principles and its state policy under Section 6.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002, were further explained. Therefore, all newly appointed AOs of NCRPO were briefed by the Accountant and the Auditor. Further, those AOs who cease to act as such have formally turned over their accountabilities (cash book with complete required liquidation of cash advance) and cash examined by the Auditor.



14)	PRO 2 Management commented that the Finance Office complied with the COA’s recommendation and ensures that no similar situation/violation will be committed in the future.





Lapses/Gaps in Internal Control 



1)		Lapses/gaps in internal control on cash and property management were noted such as: a) circuitous process flow of fund transfers from National Police Training Institute to Regional Training Centers; b) incorrect use of Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) and Property Transfer Report (PTR) forms; c) lack of necessary information on some PARs/PTRs; d) serial numbers are not indicated in the Delivery Receipts/Sales Invoice; and e) lacking information in the Inventory Report/Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment which is not in keeping with Section 123 and 124 of P.D. 1445.







--	Circuitous process of fund transfer from NPTI to RTC



	1)		Payment of Instructor’s Duty Pay (IDP) and Training and Subsistence Allowance (TSAs) by PNP - National Police Training Institute (NPTI) to end-recipients is circuitous due to the current process flow of fund transfers from PNP-NPTI to the Regional Training Centers (RTCs) as shown below:

	2)		As can be gleaned from the process/funds flow, the end-recipient receives the Instructor’s Duty Pay and Training and Subsistence Allowance only after passing through two more AOs, indicating an unsound internal control system (ICS) which could result in improper or misapplication of funds.



	3)		Section 123 and 124 of P.D. 1445 provides for the definition and installation of internal control as follows:



Section 123. Definition of internal control. Internal control is the plan of organization and all the coordinate methods and measures adopted within an organization or agency to safeguard its assets, check the accuracy and reliability of its accounting data, and encourage adherence to prescribed managerial policies.



Section 124. Installation. It shall be the direct responsibility of the agency head to install, implement, and monitor a sound system of internal control.



	4)		As a result, cash advances granted to the Disbursing Officer of PNP-NPTI for payment of Instructor’s Duty Pay and Training and Subsistence Allowance were transferred from one AO to another which is not in keeping with Section 75 of PD No. 1445 which governs the rule on transfer of funds from one officer to another, viz:



Transfer of government funds from one officer to another shall, except as allowed by law or regulation, be made only upon prior direction or authorization of the Commission or its representative.







--	Incorrect use of PAR and Property Transfer Receipt (PTR) forms



	5)		It has been observed that, for most equipment/properties, PAR is used for transfer of equipment from one AO to another instead of the PTR as in the case of transfers of the following AOs: SAO, PNP Wide, Chief, SSDD, and SAOs/RSPNCOs, shown on the diagram below.



----media/image7.png----





























	6)		Based on the diagram, it can be gleaned that starting from the SAO, PNP Wide up to the end-user, the form used is PAR.



	7)		Volume II of GAM, a PTR (Appendix 76) is used when the transfer of property is from one AO to another, as in the case of transfers from the SAO, PNP Wide to Chief, SSDD to SAO/RSPNCO. PAR (Appendix 71), on the other hand, is used from the SAO/RSPNCO to the end-user.



	8)		The current practice of issuing PAR instead of PTR defeats the purpose of the proper usage of forms. It also connotes more equipment are issued as opposed to the actual number of equipment issued. Moreover, it is confusing as to the real meaning/intention of the transferred equipment from one AO to another and/or to the end-user.



--	Lacking necessary information in some PARs/PTRs



	9)		The PARs/PTRs lacked information such as reference number, date, serial/property number, date acquired and amount which are significant in verifying the equipment/property being issued/transferred as well as the  accuracy of the data/information contained therein.



	10)		For instance, the serial numbers of the equipment were not indicated in the PARs/PTRs, making it difficult to verify the items transferred/issued:

	12)		Serial Number is defined as a number indicating place in a series and used as a means of identification. ----footnote6---- It is a unique identifier assigned sequentially to an item to uniquely identify it.



	13)		Without the serial number, proper identification of the equipment will not be established. Also, there is difficulty in terms of accounting, establishing accountability and ocular inspection of subject PPEs.



	14)		On the other hand, the SIs/DRs for the following procurements were not attached/submitted tantamount to violation of Section 4.6 of PD 1445 which states that “Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.”

	15)		The non-submission of the SI/DR precludes the Audit Team from verifying the recording, distribution and utilization of the communication equipment, EDDs and firearms.



--	Lacking information in the Inventory Report/RPCPPE



	16)		The information in the Inventory Report/RPCPPE must be complete in order to verify the distribution to end-users of the PPEs.



	17)		Below is the summary of observations noted:



		a)	Serial numbers were not recorded for 1,267 units under CEP No. 2019-15 [2,553 units Digital Mobile Radio (DMR)]; and



		b)	Serial numbers had lacking information for Digital Mobile Radios  with only the first six reference digits/letter - 18D24D – issued to PRO 2 (103 unit) and PSPG (1 unit) under CEP No. 2019-15 (2,553 units DMR).



	18)		It was also observed that some end-users were not indicated in a number of PPEs issued, as follows:

	19)		The lacking information of serial number and end-user in the RPCPPE precludes the Audit Team to verify the subject PPEs.



	20)		On the other hand, the RPCPPE showed that several items were issued to one end-user as shown in Annex P.



	21)		Had the NHQ Audit Team been given access to the PNP Logistics Data Information and Management System (LDIMS), the verification of the end-users of the subject PPEs would have been broadened. In addition, observation on lack of information in inventory report would have been minimized, if not at all, eliminated.



	22)		We recommended that Management instruct the:



				a)	NHQ concerned SAOs to:



i)	strictly ensure that complete details/information especially the serial numbers of PPE are indicated in the Sales Invoice/Delivery Receipt before receipt of the PPE; 



ii)	strictly utilize the proper forms and supply the complete information required in the preparation and issuance of PARs and PTRs; and



iii)	strictly indicate the serial number and name of end-user in the Inventory Report/RPCPPE; and



				b)	PRO 4A/NPTI Management to:



					i)	require the OIC, FSO 17 to stop the practice of transferring funds from one accountable officer to another; and 



					ii)	change/modify the mode of payment of Instructor’s Duty Pay  and Training and Subsistence Allowance from granting of cash advance in the PNP-NPTI, through the Disbursing Officer, to direct remittance of funds in the RTCs/ROs Authorized Government Depository Bank.



	23)		Management commented the following:

Incorrect use of PAR and PTR forms

NHQ Accounting Division

A Memorandum dated April 14, 2021 addressed to Director, LSS (Attn: SAO, PNP Wide and SAO, LSS) was made where the proper use of forms (PTRs and PAR) was reiterated and the noted inconsistencies in the use of the same were also brought to their attention.



Lacking necessary information in some PARs/PTRs

Coordination with personnel in charge in the preparation of PTRs was  made re: non-omission of important details such as PTR number and date, serial numbers, acquisition date, source of fund and ensuring correctness and accuracy of unit cost reflected in the PTRs prior to issuance of the same to various units/offices.

Serial numbers are not indicated in the DRs/Sales Invoice (SI)

DL

A Memorandum dated May 10, 2021 was sent to the Chief, SSDD, LSS directing to strictly ensure all SI/DRs are filled with complete details/information especially serial numbers of PPE items before receipt of the same.

PRO 4A

The Director of PNPTI already sent a Memorandum dated April 26, 2021 addressed to The Directorate for Comptrollership (Attention: Mgmt. Div.) requesting for drafting of a revised Fiscal Directive regarding the mode of payment for Training Subsistence Allowance and Instructors Duty Pay in all Regional Training Centers.



Direct remittance to the accounts of the RTC’s will be implemented as soon as the Fiscal Directive is revised.

















COMPLIANCE AUDIT



Delayed/non-submission of required financial and accounting reports, contracts/POs and other documents



1)		Delayed/non-submission of required financial and accounting reports, and other documents as provided under Section 100 of PD 1445 and COA Circular Nos. 95-006, 92-89E, 92-125A hindered timely review/audit of accounts and communication of results to management.



--	Required financial reports, disbursement vouchers (DVs) and bank reconciliation statements (BRS)



1)	Section 100 of PD 1445 and Section 6.03 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995, require the Accountable Officer to submit not later than the fifth day of the ensuing month the Monthly Report of Collections and Deposits, Report of Checks Issued and Report of Disbursement to the Chief Accountant for recording in the books of accounts. The Chief Accountant shall immediately record in the books of accounts reports submitted by the Accountable Officer and submit to the Auditor within 10 days from such receipt.



2)	Section 74 of PD 1445, on the other hand, provides that at the close of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition of the agency account standing on their books. The Head of the Agency shall see to it that reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the reports and the balance found in the books of the agency.



3)	Verification of submission of documents in PRO 6 showed that DVs together with its supporting documents amounting to P26,688,350.22 were not yet submitted to the Office of the Auditor.



4)	The Regional Accountant and Chief, Regional Finance Service Office (RFSO) reasoned that the delay in submission of the required documents were due to: a) voluminous transactions; b) skeletal workforce arrangement imposed because of the pandemic; c) delay in the submission of official receipts (ORs) or invoice from the supplier after payments were made. 



5)	Likewise, the submission of Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) in PROs 2, 6, and 12 were also late for a period ranging from one to 353 days which runs counter to Section 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, requiring the Chief Accountant to submit the BRS within 20 days after receipt of the monthly bank statement (BS). 



6)	The Regional Accountants of PROs 2 and 12 reasoned that the delayed submission of BRS was due to the late issuance of BS from the depository bank. Meanwhile, PRO 6 Accountant stated that delivery of BS was delayed due to lockdown in March 2020. Considering the limited work force, preparation and submission of BRS were also delayed.



7)	On the other hand, PRO 4B were not able to prepare the BRS for the period of July to December 2020 due to unavailability of BS. The non-preparation of BRS resulted to unreliable records involving cash transactions and affected the reliability and accuracy of Cash in Bank balances.



8)	The failure of Management to adhere to existing rules and regulations in the submission of reports affected the timeliness of audit. 



9)	We recommended that Management direct the:



							a)	PROs 2, 6 and 12 concerned Accountants and/responsible officers to faithfully observe the prompt submission of DVs, together with supporting documents and BRS within the prescribed period; and



							b)	PRO 4B Accountant to communicate with the depositary bank and secure copies of bank statement and enroll in the bank’s online facility to be able to keep track of its balances and to update regularly the reconciliation of bank accounts.



10)	Management commented the following:



Office

Comments

PRO 2

For the 3rd quarter due to the pandemic, personnel of LBP were working on 50 percent capacity which caused the delay of BS submission which consequently caused the delay of the report. However, at year end, all BRS were prepared on time using snapshots requested by the agency.

PRO 4B

Memorandum dated April 27, 2021 was sent to Regional Finance Service Office (RFSO) 4B requesting timely submission of BS issued by LBP or snap shots of the same.  



RFSO 4B took immediate action on the said request on April 29, 2021. Said office will provide the documents every month end.

PRO 6

Remaining unsubmitted DVs to date amounting to P2,187,699.60 mostly pertains to payment of fixed expenditures. RFSO 6 required concerned units/offices to submit paid DVs with attached ORs. While payment through banks during implementation of ECQ, ORs were requested from various service companies as attachment to paid DVs.



To address delayed release of BS, bank accounts were enrolled to weAccess facility of Landbank to be able to gather data necessary for timely preparation and submission of BRS.

PRO 12

The Regional Accounting Office (RAO) had requested LBP- Pioneer Branch, General Santos City to regularly furnish BS for Account Number 0172- 1012- 08 TRF to avoid delay in the preparation of BRS. BRS for the month of February 2021 was already submitted.



--	Delayed/non-submission of advance copies of Contracts/POs 



11)	Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No.2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 requires that: Within five working days from the execution of contract/Purchase Order xxx, a copy of said contract and each of all documents forming part thereof or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.



12)	In NHQ, NCRPO, SAF and PROs 7, 11 and 13, some contracts/Purchase Orders were belatedly submitted to the Office of the Auditor and/or became available only upon submission of DVs as one of the supporting documents. Clearly, the delay consisting of a period of 41 to 287 days runs counter to the requirement set forth in Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001.



13)	We recommended and NHQ, NCRPO, SAF and PROs 7, 11 and 13 Management agreed to require the BAC to submit copies of perfected contracts/Purchase Orders, bidding documents and all related documents to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed period pursuant to COA Circular No. 2009-001 to afford timely review of contracts.



14)	Management of NHQ, NCRPO, SAF, PROs 7 11 and 13 commented that copies of perfected contracts were submitted to the Office of the Auditor. In addition, BAC of PROs and NSUs are directed to submit advance copies of perfected contracts/POs and other related documents to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed period pursuant to COA Circular No. 2009-001 to afford timely review of contracts.



--	Delayed submission of Notice of Acceptance of Deliveries



15)	Section 6.06 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 obliges the, official responsible for or in charge of accepting deliveries of procured items shall, within twenty-four (24) hours from such acceptance, shall notify the auditor of the time and date of the scheduled deliveries.



16)	In NCRPO and SAF, the request for inspection of deliveries was not submitted to the Office of the Auditor within 24 hours from acceptance thereof as prescribed under COA Circular 95-006; thus, hampering the verification of whether actual goods delivered and accepted were consistent with the specification as stipulated in the PO/contract.



17)	We recommended and NCRPO and SAF Management agreed to direct the Chief, RLMD and the SAO to submit the Notice of Acceptance (NOA) of deliveries within 24 hours from such acceptance.



18)	NCRPO and SAF Management commented that the Chief, RLRDD and Chief, LMD with SAO committed to submit the NOA of deliveries within 24 hours from such acceptance for all approved projects implemented.





Compliance with RA 9184



1)	SAF Management has not rescinded contracts with suppliers of equipment under the Capability Enhancement Program (CEP) despite incurring delays and cumulative liquidated damages ranging from 29 to 116.30 percent equivalent to P1.011 billion of the aggregate contract amount of P1.694 billion, clearly over and above the maximum allowed liquidated damages of 10 percent as set forth in Section 68 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9184; thus, delaying the upgrade/modernization of equipment critical to the attainment of the SAF mission as envisioned under the CEP of the PNP.



1)	Section 68 of the RIRR of R.A. 9184, states that: All contracts executed in accordance with the Act and this IRR shall contain a provision on liquidated damages which shall be payable by the contractor in case of breach thereof.  For the procurement of Goods, Infrastructure Projects and Consulting Services, the amount of the liquidated damages shall be at least equal to one-tenth of one percent (.0001) of the cost of the unperformed portion for every day of delay.  Once the cumulative amount of liquidated damages reaches ten percent (10%) of the amount of the contract, the Procuring Entity may rescind or terminate the contract, without prejudice to other courses of action and remedies available under the circumstances.



2)	Similarly, Article VII of the contract signed by Management and supplier states that: In case the amount of collectible from Supplier as penalty for unjustified delay in the delivery of the items shall exceed ten percent (10%) of the contract price, the Director, PNP SAF upon the recommendation of the PNP SAF BAC, may rescind this Contract and forfeit in favor of the PNP SAF the performance security.



3)	Various contracts stipulate delivery timelines ranging from 90 to 240 calendar days from the date of receipt of the Notice to Proceed (NTP).



4)	It is worthy to note that all 29 procurement contracts for the delivery of various equipment under the CEP totaling P1,693,669,525.55 remained undelivered as of December 31, 2020; thus, incurring delays for a period ranging from 290 to 1,163 days or 29.00 percent to 116.30 percent of the contract amounts with cumulative liquidated damages amounting to P1,011,087,957.50. Details are shown in Annex Q. 



5)	Failure to rescind/terminate contracts is not in keeping with Section 68 of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 which provides that, once the cumulative amount of liquidated damages reaches ten percent (10%) of the amount of the contract, the Procuring Entity may rescind or terminate the contract without prejudice to other courses of action and remedies available under the circumstances.



6)	We recommended that Management direct the SAF Director to: 



a)	instruct the Chairman, BAC to strictly adhere to the provisions of Section 68 of the Revised IRR of R.A. 9184 and Article VII of the contracts without further delay to protect the interest of the government; 



b)	ban or blacklist delinquent suppliers from participating in future procurement projects of the agency to avoid recurrence of similar problems; and



c)	forfeit entire performance security bond.



7)	SAF Management commented that there are 13 remaining contracts which have been extended due to the following reasons:

		

a)	Management did not impute to the suppliers the delay where no End-User’s Certificate (EUC) was issued by the Chief, PNP due to  Presidential Directive No. 2018-0090-0091 dated February 4, 2018 with subject: Cease the Procurement of Helicopters and Arms from Canada and the USA.



b)	Approval of EUC resumed only in the first quarter of 2020 until pandemic was declared in March 2020.



8)	Furthermore, Management explained that they will deliberate on the extensions not covered by the above exemptions.











Audit of Pension Fund



Unreliable Alpha List of Pensioners



2)		Unreliable Alpha List of Pensioners in the Pension Deduction and Loan Information System (PDLIS) impacted the accuracy and reliability of the payroll of pensioners due to lax implementation of monitoring mechanism resulting in: a) un-updated Alpha List of Pensioners in the Police Retirement and Benefits Units (PRBUs); b) failure to prepare and submit updated reports on losses and reports on pensioners to the PNP Retirement and Benefits Administration Service (PRBS); and c) failure to strictly monitor and properly inform some pensioners on the duties and responsibilities of their assigned active personnel-buddy, which is not in keeping with PNP Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) No. 2020-001 and PNP MC No. 2020-049. Moreover, the risk of undetected withdrawals from individual ATM accounts of pensioners under “tag and hold” status is not discounted due to lack of status report from the Land Bank of the Philippines as to the actual balance of their respective ATM accounts. There were also incidences of returned payments of pension benefits to 165 pensioners with closed/dormant accounts.



1)	At the risk of being repetitive, IPSAS 1 Paragraph 29(b) provides that fair presentation requires an entity, to present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable, and understandable information.” Appendix A of the same IPSAS defines reliable information as “free from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. 



2)	Section 111 of PD 1445, on the other hand, emphasized the importance of keeping the accounts of the agency in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency. The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. (Emphasis ours)



3)	The PNP PRBS core mandate is to administer the retirement, separation, and death benefits of PNP Personnel as well as implementation of plans and programs that would uplift the morale and welfare of the PNP pensioners. Its functions, among others, include the following: 



		a)	Examine the legality, validity and completeness of all supporting documents attached to the claims in line with the accounting and auditing requirements; and



		b)	Maintain PNP retirees information system and responsible for the issuance of PNP Identification Cards for retirees and their beneficiaries.



4)	As of December 31, 2020, there were reported total of 90,301 active pensioners consisting of retirees, transferees, survivors and allottees:

5)	For purposes of discussion, the following terms are defined as follows:



			a)	Transferees pertain to legitimate beneficiaries of deceased retirees; survivors pertain to legitimate beneficiaries of personnel who died while on active duty prior to their retirement; and allottees pertain to beneficiary of a living retiree who is receiving a portion of the latter’s pension as decreed by court or adjudicated by quasi-judicial bodies;



			b)	Unqualified pensioners pertain to those pensioners who are already deceased, have remarried, have attained age of majority, have changed nationality, among other causes as mentioned in Item 7(d) of SOP 2020-001; and



		c)	“Tag and hold” refer to the process of withholding a pension of an unaccounted pensioners. 



6)	The pension benefits of pensioners are deposited through the LBP and credited in their individual ATM accounts. Likewise, the list of all qualified pensioners is being maintained and monitored through a process of validation conducted by PRBS and the PRBUs. 

 

7)	The PNP Pension Fund paid an average monthly pension of P2.79 Billion to retirees, transferees, survivors, and allottees in CY 2020 alone. Thus, it is critical for the PNP to develop, implement and maintain a strong monitoring mechanism to ensure that pensioners’ data in the PDLIS, which produces the alpha list of pensioners and basis for the preparation of monthly payroll, is accurate and reliable and must at least provide near real time status of pensioners in order to produce a monthly payroll not contaminated with unqualified pensioners.



8)	In CY 2020, the Chief, PNP and the Chief, Directorial Staff introduced new policies and procedures to determine the present status of pensioners. These include the following issuances:



		a)	PNP SOP No. 2020-001 dated February 3, 2020 issued by The Chief, Directorial Staff Re: “Policies and Guidelines in the Conduct of Accounting, Monitoring, and Periodic Audit of Pensioners for the Protection of the PNP Pension Fund” which provided the policies, guidelines and procedures in the conduct of regular accounting and monitoring of pensioners and periodic auditing of pensioners Alpha list under the administrative jurisdiction of PRBS.



		b)	PNP Memorandum Circular No. 2020-049 dated July 21, 2020 issued by the Chief, PNP Re: PKSK Project which provided the system to match or pair with and assign an active personnel to each pensioner, utilize the buddy system to regularly monitor the health, wellness, and condition of pensioners, and account and update them more frequently at this time of pandemic.



9)	The Management efforts to pro-actively update and cleanse the pension system to provide a more efficient pension administration in which the effects of unqualified pensioners are mitigated, if not eradicated is well noted. However, as things stand, there is still a need to improve the system considering the deficiencies noted in audit which affect the integrity (valid, complete and accurate) of the Alpha List and payroll of pensioners.



Lax implementation of monitoring mechanism



10)	Monitoring refers to the processes that assess the quality of the internal control system’s performance over time. It may consist of processes and procedures done to provide assurance that prompt and updated data of pensioners are used by the Management in budget formulation and review as well as ensuring accuracy and reliability of pensioners’ payroll for the effective and efficient administration of the Agency’s pension system.



--	Failure to maintain/update the Alpha List of Pensioners by the PRBUs

11)	Section 2(c) of PNP Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) No. 2020-001 dated February 3, 2020 provides that, the conduct of inventory of INP/PNP pensioners is an inherent mandate of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Retirement and Benefit Administration Services (PRBS). It is a continuing process to monitor the welfare of the pensioners; attend to their social needs like the livelihood and health programs; to know their whereabouts; and to determine whether they are still qualified to receive pension from the government.



12)	Also, item No. 7(a) paragraphs 5 and 6 states:



PRBUs shall maintain their own Alpha List of pensioners and shall submit an updated report on losses to PRBS on a monthly basis. However, reports of deaths and remarriage must be reported immediately. They shall initiate the conduct of inventory in coordination with the local police when needed. They shall be responsible for notification of pensioners through text/phone/call/mails/e-mails/radio message/chats stating therein the venue and schedule two months prior to the schedule of inventory and updating of pensioners in their Area of Responsibility. Contact numbers of the next of kin must be maintained in order to facilitate the proper notification of pensioners;



A monitoring list shall be maintained for minor beneficiary/ies and TPPD Transferees indicating therein the period up to when they are entitled to receive pension from the period up to when they are entitled to receive pension from the PNP and be subjected for deletion if no longer entitled. PRBUs shall send a report on pensioners who are subject for deletion from the Alpha List. A separate list shall be maintained for pensioners who are incapacitated and qualified to receive lifetime pension from the PNP pursuant to Section 25, paragraph 2 of NAPOLCOM Board of Officers Resolution No. 8.



13)	In CY 2020, the PRBUs of PROs, 9, 10 and 13 were able to successfully conduct inventory of pensioners thru the Nationwide Accounting of Pensioners (NAP) in February and March, and the Modified Nationwide Accounting of Pensioners (MNAP) in May to June. These series of inventory undertaking resulted in the accounting and the identification of pensioners whose accounts were subjected to deletion due to (a) remarriage; (b) minors reaching the age of majority; and (c) deceased pensioners. 



14)	However, the following observations were noted during the audit:



Table 26

PROs

Observations

PROs 4B, 9, 10, 13 and COR

PRBUs have not maintained much less update their own alpha lists of pensioners despite the conduct of pensioner inventories thru the NAP and MNAP. 



The same PRBUs did not bother to submit needed inputs to PRBS when the PKSK Project was implemented. 

PROs 13 and COR

Management and the PRBUs concerned failed to produce key reports such as the monitoring list for minor beneficiaries and Total Permanent Physical Disability (TPPD). This is a vital report since it indicates and covers the period of the duration of pension (until the last day) to which this class of pensioners are entitled to receive pension from the PNP.

PRO 5

The Alpha List of Pensioners with related reports disclosed that: one pensioner-buddy was included in the PKSK Alpha List of Pensioners, but was not included in the PRBU Alpha List; and 2) comparison of the List of Retirees, Transferees, Survivors and Allottees as of December 31, 2020 with the Consolidated Report on Quarterly Wellness Check and Visitation for the period covered September 1 to November 30, 2020 disclosed that at least 46 pensioners whose names were listed as “alive” as of December 31, 2020 in the PRBU List of Retirees, Transferees, Survivors and Allottees were, in fact, already listed as “deceased” in the PKSK project List.



--	Failure to prepare and submit updated reports on losses and reports on pensioners



15)	PNP SOP No. 2020-001 policies, guidelines, and procedures in the conduct of regular accounting and monitoring of pensioners and periodic auditing of pensioners Alpha List under the administrative jurisdiction of PRBS include:



Item No. 7(a) par. 5

xxx…5. PRBU shall maintain their own Alpha List of Pensioners and shall submit an updated report on losses to PRBS on a monthly basis…xxx



Item No. 7(a) par. 6

xxx…6. A monitoring list shall be maintained for minor beneficiary/ies and TPPD Transferees indicating therein the period up to when they are entitled to receive pension from the PNP and be subjected for deletion if no longer entitled. PRBUs shall send a report on pensioners who are subject for deletion in the Alpha List…xxx



16)	Verification of documents revealed that the PRBU PRO 3 maintains an Alpha List of pensioners but does not prepare and submit updated reports on losses and reports on pensioners who are subject for deletion from the aforementioned Alpha List as required in PNP SOP No. 2020-001.



17)	The non-preparation and non-submission of the prescribed reports prevented the PRBS in applying necessary controls in ensuring that pensioners who should be removed from the Alpha List are actually removed and that discrepancies and/or variances among records may be identified and acted upon accordingly.





--	Failure to strictly monitor and properly inform some pensioners on the duties and responsibilities of their assigned active personnel-buddy

18)	In order to assess the proper implementation of PKSK project, various names of pensioners-buddy were randomly selected from the PRO 2 Alpha List of pensioners and subsequently interviewed without the knowledge of their respective “active police personnel-buddy”. It was gathered during said interviews that out of 16 respondents, six or 37.5 percent gave unfavourable responses/comments and openly admitted that the role, activities and obligations of their respective assigned active personnel-buddy as embodied in the above-quoted Memorandum were not strictly and religiously followed. Some active police personnel-buddy even failed to explain the PKSK project to their assigned pensioner-buddy, therefore, they are not aware nor knowledgeable about the PKSK project. It was also noted that the “Buddy System” was not properly implemented since some of active personnel-buddy were not able to conduct regular visits on their assigned Pensioner-Buddy in order to monitor health, check wellness, assist, physically account and update the latter more frequently especially at this time of the pandemic.



19)	Moreover, survey questionnaires were also floated by the PRO 2 Audit Team to selected pensioner-buddy, on which each questionnaire consists of two parts. The first part of the survey questionnaire determines whether their corresponding active personnel-buddy performs the initial wellness check and visitation and quarterly wellness check visitation, as required by the above-mentioned Memorandum while the second part gives the pensioner-buddy the opportunity to rate the over-all performance of his respective active personnel-buddy.



20)	Results of the returned and answered questionnaires revealed that some Active Personnel-Buddy did not even give their contact numbers to their Pensioner-Buddy, which is only one of the reasons why constant communication between them was not established, hence, camaraderie and fellowship that the PKSK project seeks to rekindle was not attained which is one of its main objectives.



21)	The observations only show that the reporting and monitoring mechanisms are not adequately implemented. It bears emphasis that strict adherence to established rules as well as timely monitoring and updating of pensioners’ status in the system would allow the PRBS to come up with a data closest to the actual number of pensioners who are still alive and active and are still qualified to receive their pension benefits as of a given date to assist the PNP in budgeting and payment thereof.



22)	The gaps noted, therefore, fail to assure the integrity of the alpha list of pensioners crucial in the preparation of a monthly payroll of pensioners that is supposed to be free from unqualified pensioners.



23)	We recommended that Management:



a)	instruct concerned Police Retirement and Benefits Units (PRBUs) of PROs 4B, 5, 9, 10, 13, and COR, officers and personnel to monitor strict implementation of established policies in the maintenance of alpha lists, accounting, and timely updating of pensioners in accordance with PNP SOP No. 2020-001;



b)	direct the PNP Retirement and Benefits Administration Service (PRBS) and PRBUs to conduct cross-matching of records with other PNP data-bases maintained by Directorate for Personnel and Records Management (DPRM), Finance Service (FS) and Information Technology Management Service (ITMS) to locate discrepancies and apply appropriate actions, if warranted;



c)	direct concerned personnel of the PRBU in PRO 3 to maintain updated reports on losses and reports on pensioners who are subject for deletion from the Alpha List as required in the existing guidelines in order to preserve integrity of the Alpha List of pensioners which is the source document and basis in the payment of the pension benefit; and



d)	direct the Management of PRO 2 to ensure strict compliance of the Active Personnel-Buddy in performing their duties and responsibilities with their respective Pensioner-Buddy, as provided in PNP MC No. 2020-049 dated July 21, 2020. Require concerned officials and personnel of PRBS and FS to account pension benefits paid to unqualified pensioners and thereafter initiate recovery thereof and remit recovered amounts to the BTr pursuant to Section 10 of GAA for FY 2020.



24)	Management commented the following: 



Office

Comments

NHQ

PRBS

PRBS has published Memo Circulars and Operating Procedures that govern the policies, guidelines and mechanisms in the regular accounting and updating of PNP pensioners.



To further enhance this mechanism, the “Pensioner Ko, Sagot Ko” (PKSK) Project under PNP MC No. 2020-049 dated July 21, 2020 was launched. The project entails for the pairing with assignment of an active PNP personnel to a pensioner and utilize the pairing as a buddy system to regularly monitor the health, wellness and condition of PNP pensioners and in the process, account and update the pensioners on a quarterly basis.



Inspite of these established updating ad monitoring schemes, lapses and oversights have occurred, notably in the delayed reporting of prevailing status of a pensioner such as those who have been found to be deceased, reached the age of majority, re-marriage and other disqualifying circumstances. This has resulted in the overpayment of pensions being deposited to the Pension accounts from the time pensioner is disqualified up to the submission of report on the actual status of the pensioner.



So as to ensure real-time monitoring and updating of pensioners, the PNP, through the PRBS will operationalize the PNP Pensioner On-line Accounting System (PPOAS) which will complement the gains of the PKSK Project. 



The operational test run of the aforementioned online accounting system is currently on going to gauge its capability handling large data entries and to undertake necessary adjustment in technical issues that may be encountered.



The following are additional actions taken:



a.1. Sustain accounting of pensioners thru PKSK and POAS.

a.2 Validation undertaken whereby 11 of the disqualified pensioners were restored for various justifications (alive, located, accounted, others). 



a.3 Alternate recovery efforts thru Debit/Credit system with the PNP FS, whereby overpayments are deducted in the succeeding monthly pensions of the transferees of disqualified pensioners.



b.1 The provisions stated under PNP MC 2020-045 (PKSK Project) will be continued. All those found as disqualified shall be subsequently deleted.



b.2 Pursue full implementation of the PPOAS in compliance to the PKSK project of the PNP and to complement the gains achieved thereof.



Finance Service 

The Finance Service agrees with the recommendation by the Commission to recover pension benefits paid to unqualified pensioners. This Service has been coordinating with the PRBS to facilitate recovery through collection of overpayments to pension benefits paid to unqualified pensioners and remit recovered amounts to the BTr.



Relative thereto, the PNP created a Board of Inquiry (BOI) pursuant to DPRM Letter Order No. NHQ-LO-TWG-2020-1182 dated July 7, 2020. The Board was tasked to recover all Pension Fund Overpayments to include those deductions remitted to FIs and the outstanding balances in the LBP Accounts.

Moreover, the Board recommended to craft a policy on guidelines and procedures of recovery of overpayments from the LBP Accounts and FIs. Thus, a draft PNPMC establishing guidelines and procedures in the reversion of overpayments to the BTr was crafted and same will be endorsed to Chief, PNP for his approval and signature.

PROs 2, 3 and 13

Agreed with the recommendation



PRO 4B

PRBU 4B submitted a list of pensioners to PRBS for verification and reconciliation on March 20, 2021.  Also, PRBS required them to submit the updated list of pensioners every quarter. 

PRO 5

The pensioner that was listed in the PKSK but was not in the PRBU5 list is a pensioner from PRBU1 but reported for change address and appeared at Legazpi City CPS for updating on the last quarter of 2020. Pensioner is now residing at Purok 7, Puro, Legazpi City, and was included in the PRBU5 Alpha List as of January 2021.



The Alpha List maintained by PRBU5 was provided by PRBS, thus, deceased pensioner or those who have reached the age of majority cannot be immediately deleted or changed by PRBU5. However, PRBU5 render/submit to PRBS on a weekly basis the Report on Death of Pensioners, Remarry or Age of Majority to PRBS for deletion/change to Alpha List, afterwards PRBU is requesting monthly for an updated Alpha List then counter check it with the list of the PRBU.

PRO 9

The PRBU 9 has pursued its pensioner validation activities since last year and has submitted the required reports to PRBS. Two memoranda addressed to the Director, PRBS attest to the action being taken by PRBU 9. As of January 21, 2021, the total number of validated pensionersꞌ data was 1,112.

PRBU 9 has maintained its own Alpha list of pensioners based on results of its own validation. As of January 2021, the total number of pensioners is 4,457. In addition, an Alpha list for Data Capturing identified 1,112 pensioners with their corresponding names, class (retiree or survivor), address and contact number, and dates of birth and death. As mentioned, retiree or survivor with incomplete data are also identified for further verification and validation, maintenance and updating of pensioner’s Alpha list.



PRBU 9 has conducted cross-matching of records with other PNP data-bases to locate discrepancies and apply appropriate actions, if warranted, since August of last year 



As reported, some of pensioners who have reached the age of majority were disqualified because they failed to update their birth months of September 09, 2019 and December 09, 2019, respectively, during MNAP. 

PRO 10

On the issue of maintaining Alpha List of pensioners, a total 4,334 pensioners were maintained by the Regional Personnel and Human Resource Development Division prior to implementation of PKSK program spearheaded by RPRMD in the last quarter of CY 2020. RPRMD recorded a total of 4,622 pensioners which is higher by 288 against PRBU record. On the 1st quarter CY 2021, PRO 10 has accounted a total of 4,510 and after submitting the same to HPRBS for validations and cross-matching with other PNP databases, a total 4,592 pensioners were recorded for PRO 10 and it is the new Alpha List of pensioners of PRO 10 on the said quarter. 

Presently, the 2nd Quarter CY 2021 accounting of pensioners is being conducted online through the PNP Pensioners Online Accounting System (PPOAS) and that there are 4,743 pensioners for PRO 10 and updated Alpha List. The pensioners must log in to the system to be accounted and to be validated by their Active Personnel Buddy (APB) to be qualified. The PRBU10 continues to update said Alpha List.

PRO COR

PRBU Cordillera replied that they are using the Alpha List provided by PRBS as basis for updating data of pensioners. The list of minor beneficiaries with complete details are incorporated in the Alpha List which serve as basis in determining the period of majority in effecting the stoppage of pension and eventual deletion of pension account. Furthermore, validation activities and cross matching of records are being undertaken.







--	         Undetected withdrawals from the total of P425,148,635.68 pension benefits deposited to the individual ATM accounts of 8,663 pensioners under “tag and hold” status is not discounted due to lack of status report from the LBP as to the actual balance of their respective ATM accounts 

25)	Item 7(a)(2) of SOP 2020-001 dated February 3, 2020 likewise provides that pensioners who are either physically incapacitated or for medical and legal reasons are unable to be physically accounted at the PRBU offices, may avail house/jail/hospital visitation through request by his next of kin to the PRBS/PRBUs/local police. Pensioners may also avail of online updating.



26)	As defined in SOP 2020-001, “tag and hold” refers to the process of withholding of a pension of an unaccounted pensioner.



27)	Item 7(c)(1) of SOP 2020-001 categorically directs the PRBUs to submit a report of unaccounted pensioners with request for tagging and holding of an account a day after his/her birthdate. A notice of Accounting/Updating must be sent a month before the schedule of inventory to the subject pensioner through any available means (text, phone call/video call/registered mail/chat/visitation). Item 7(c)(2) further provides that PRBS Inventory Section shall write a letter to the LBP requesting for tagging and holding of such account.



28)	Request for lifting of pensioner account on “tag and hold” status may be made personally at PRBS, through the PRBUs or to the active buddy. On the other hand, deleted pensioners may seek restoration of his/her pension account by personal appearance and submission of pertinent documents.



29)	For CY 2020, PNP was able to transfer P33.52 billion to the LBP for the payment of regular pension benefits which were credited to the individual ATM accounts of PNP/INP pensioners. The amount includes payment of pensions to pensioners who were put on “tag and hold” status.



30)	Upon inquiry, the PDLIS currently does not have a function to determine whether a particular pensioner had failed to update his/her status. However, a prior system, the Pensioners Data Integration Generation System (PDIGS), utilized by the PRBS has functions that would be able to generate list of pensioners who are due for updating a given month for a timely information on whether the pensioner is still alive and active. In addition, the same system generates list of pensioners who were not able to update their status which will be subject for “tag and hold”. This function could have been beneficial to the PDLIS in producing timely data of pensioners for tagging and holding to supplement actual validation of pensioner status.



31)	The PRBS regularly submits request for tagging and holding of accounts to the LBP upon receipt of information from the regional units as well as the reports from the active buddy of the pensioner upon accounting or visitation. The accounts under “tag and hold” status remain as such until such time a pensioner was able to update his/her status or upon arrival of the 6-month period of inactivity of the pensioner which is a ground for deletion of his account.



32)	Records showed that out of the P33,520,150,431.21 worth of pension benefits transferred to the LBP, P425,148,635.68 or 1.27 percent pertains to the deposit of pension benefits of 8,663 pensioners whose status remained on “tag and hold” as of December 31, 2020. Based on the review of reports obtained, most of the reasons why pensioners were put on “tag and hold” status are due to unaccounted or under investigation, unqualified pensioners and those who were identified as unlocated, among others, during the conduct of the NAP, MNAP and PKSK.



33)	Although the monthly pension benefits were already deposited to the individual ATM account of the pensioners despite their unclear latest status, the same could not be withdrawn until the LBP is notified by the PRBS of the lifting of “tag and hold” status.



34)	This practice resulted in the accumulation of cash in the aggregate amount of P425,148,635.68 in the ATM accounts of pensioners on “tag and hold” status in CY 2020. The table below shows the aging or length of time the pension is withheld in the ATM accounts of pensioners under “tag and hold” status which ranges from one to11 months.

P425,148,635.68



35)	The aggregate amount of P425,148,635.68 was determined by multiplying the tagged and held pensioner’s monthly net pension in the payroll with the number of months it cannot be withdrawn reckoned from the date the account of the pensioner was put on “tag and hold” status until December 31, 2020.



36)	It bears stressing that the “tag and hold” status of these accounts were not yet lifted as of December 31, 2020. Hence, the P425,148,635.68 remains deposited in the ATM of pensioners, though not withdrawable. However, despite significant amounts deposited in the ATM accounts, neither the Finance Service nor the PRBS has control mechanism in place to determine if such amounts are still intact or already withdrawn by the pensioner.



37)	Upon inquiry, the FS and PRBS stated that they are able to check balances of individual accounts of those pensioners upon request to the LBP of the account statements of pensioners.



38)	It is worth noting that the process is tedious considering that the PRBS need to request from time to time with the LBP on the status of the ATM balance of individual accounts of pensioners. This current practice increases the risk that a significant amount if not all of the P425,148,635.68 is withdrawn anytime without being detected, added the fact that such was already recorded as expense in the accounting records.



--	Non- deletion of accounts of 464 pensioners on “tag and hold” status for more than six months which is not in keeping with Item 7(c)(3) of SOP 2020-001



39)	If a pensioner’s account has been tagged and held for six months and in the absence of any action for updating or to be accounted on the part of such pensioners, Item 7(c)(3) of SOP 2020-001 requires that coordination must be made immediately to the LBP for the closure of his account and reversion of available balance to the PNP Pension Fund. List of accounts that were tagged and held will be maintained for monitoring by PRBS or concerned PRBUs.



40)	The lifting of “tag and hold” status of a pensioner is primarily done when the pensioner updates his status with his active buddy for verification. Otherwise, when there is inaction on the part of the pensioner for six months or more, such account of the pensioner shall be subjected for deletion.



41)	Review of the list of accounts revealed that out of the 8,663 pensioners under “tag and hold” status as of December 31, 2020, 464 pensioners with a total pension of P91,000,453.46----footnote7---- were on “tag and hold” status for at least six months but the pension benefits were still deposited to the individual ATM accounts of pensioners despite the high probability that said pensioners are not anymore qualified to receive their monthly pensions. The noted observation blatantly runs counter to Item 7(c)(3) of SOP 2020-001.



42)	While there were several resolutions made requesting such accounts to be deleted, making the timely request to the LBP is of utmost importance and critical in order 	to avoid incurring leakage costs due to overpayment of pension benefits. For one, a resolution was made only in December 2020 for those accounts which have been on “tag and hold” status as early as February 2020 but should have been requested to the LBP for deletion as early as August 2020 instead of December following the aforementioned provision of SOP 2020-001. Furthermore, it exposes the PNP to the risk that such amounts transferred to the individual ATM accounts may no longer be recovered.



43)	We recommended that Management:



a)	direct the Directors of PRBS and FS to:



		i)	request the LBP to regularly submit a status report duly supported with statement of accounts (SOA), transaction history, and other relevant documents for all pensioners who are on “tag and hold” status to ensure that the amounts deposited to their accounts remain intact; and



		ii)	reconcile the amounts in the account statements of pensioners on “tag and hold” status to determine total deposits versus total withdrawals, if any. In case of overpayment and/or undetected withdrawals, pursue recovery and immediately remit the amounts recovered to the BTr and submit the results of reconciliation and other relevant documents to the COA;



b)	consider forming a committee consisting of the heads of PNP Retirement and Benefits Administration Service (PRBS), Finance Service, Directorate for Comptrollership, Accounting Division, Information Technology Management Service and representative from PRBUs to study amendments to SOP 2020-001 particularly in deferring payment of pension benefits of pensioners on “tag and hold” status instead of releasing the pension benefits immediately to the individual ATM accounts pending verification of the actual status for control and monitoring purposes to minimize the risk of overpayment to unqualified pensioners; and



c)	consider recording the pension benefits due to pensioners who are on “tag and hold” status under Pension Benefits Payable account pending the verification of their actual status.



44)	NHQ Management commented the following:



Office

Comments

PRBS

Efforts have already been made in coordinating with the Management of the LBP for this purpose.



In relation to this, the PRBS has sent requests to LBP in various occasions for copies of the Statement of Transaction Information (STI) of pension accounts placed on ‘tag and hold” status. The LBP has been consistent in their policy in strictly enforcing the non-withdrawal of any amount from a “tagged and held” accounts, thus, ensuring the protection and safety of the amount remaining in these accounts. In addition, a Memorandum duly signed by the Chief of the Directorial Staff (TCDS) dated February 15, 2021 was sent to the Deputy Director, DPRM/Chairman, PNP Pension Fund Board directing same to convene immediately the Pension Fund Board to undertake review evaluation and possible amendments of PNP SOP 2020-001 as the majority of the members as the said Board comes from offices specially mentioned in the AOM who were recommended to study the amendments of the aforementioned SOP.



The PNP Pension Fund Board (PFB) was created pursuant to DPRM letter Orders No. 170 dated June 23, 2020, hence, it is viewed that the Board is the appropriate body who shall review and institute amendments to the provisions of SOP 2020-001 instead of creating another Committee. 



The PFB has issued Resolution No. 2021-004 recommending the amendment of PNP SOP 2020-001, particularly:

 

a)	Definition of “Tag and Hold”,

b)	Revision in the required period of placing a pensioner account to a “tag and hold” status prior to deletion from the PNP Pensioner’s Alpha List; and

c)	Para 7, Section c# of SOP 2020-001 was amended, and the required number of months for the tag and hold status for the account to be deleted has been reduced from six months to three months.



On the issue re: consider recording the pension benefits due to pensioners who are on “tag and hold” status under Pension Benefits Payable



The PRBS commented that this is another issue that has cropped up in the process of implementing the provisions of SOP 2020-001; hence, the matter will be taken as among the primordial agenda during the convening of the PNP Pension Fund Board.



Specifically, amendments on the provision pertaining to the deletion of an account placed on “tag and hold” status for six months, as well as the coverage of amount placed on “tag and hold”, whether Gross Monthly Pension or Net Monthly Pension, shall also be tackled by the Board.



Consultations shall also be undertaken between concerned PNP offices/units and allied agencies, such as the AD of DC, the PNP FS, PRNS, the PNP Legal Service, the LBP, the BTr and the DBM to look into the legal facets in establishing the particular benefits/amounts for this purpose.



Anent the 121 pensioners who still received pension payments during CY 2020, the PRBS commented that 63 pensioners who were reported to be deceased during the conduct of Nationwide Accounting of Pensioners (NAP), MNAP, and PKSK were already deleted from the alpha list of pensioners while 14 pensioners were already put on “tag and hold” status.



Finance Service (FS)

FS shall request PRBS to regularly furnish the office the list of pensioners who are on “tag and hold” status and subsequently, request from the LBP of their STI wherein the SOA, transaction history and other relevant pieces of information are reflected. 



FS, as one of the members of the Pension Fund Board that implements SOP 2020-001 shall make manifestation to the Board to study and/or amend SOP 2020-001 particularly in deferring payment of pension benefits to pensioners on “tag and hold” status.

Accounting Division (AD)

The Accounting Division will undertake necessary steps for recording of pensioners under “Tag and Hold” status to the Pension Benefits Payable Account following standard accounting procedures. Upon receipt of the separate list of pensioners under “Tag and Hold” status, the Accounting Division will also verify if said pensioners are not included in the Alpha list of paid pensioners and will then recognize as Pension Benefits Payable.



--	Payments of pension benefits returned by the LBP due to Closed/Dormant Bank Accounts 

1)	Based on the Payroll Exception Summary Report from the LBP for CY 2020, pension benefits of 165 pensioners amounting to P21,890,827.60----footnote8---- were returned by the LBP and temporarily deposited back to the PNP ATM Pension Account (1862-1026-61). The undistributed balances were mainly due to closed/dormant accounts and inexistent account numbers owing to the failure of the pensioners to update their accounts regularly. Details are as follows:

2)	Of the 165 accounts of pensioners whose pensions were returned by the LBP, only 91 were able to update/validate accounts while the rest were either deleted from payroll or remained not updated as of December 31, 2020.



3)	Per our inquiry with the PRBS, the rejected accounts will be made current once pensioners present themselves for updating and submit the required update forms. The PRBS will then endorse the updated accounts of the pensioners to FS for validation prior to notifying the LBP. For those accounts that were not updated, their pension will remain in the LBP ATM Pension Account until such time the pensioners’ records are updated. This resulted in the accumulation of cash balance in the bank which defeats the government’s objective of maximizing the use of government resources.



4)	We recommended that Management direct the Directors of PNP Retirement and Benefits Administration Service (PRBS) and Finance Service to immediately verify and validate the accounts of pensioners that were rejected by the LBP by notifying the pensioners of such action by the bank upon receipt of the report. If the pensioner is still qualified, expedite the deposit to the updated account. Otherwise, remit the returned amounts without valid claims deposited in the PNP Pension ATM Account to the BTr.



5)	NHQ Management commented that it is the intention of the PNP thru the PRBS and PNPFS to review the MOA with the LBP, particularly in the provisions of reverting recovered pension overpayments directly to the BTr as required by the GAA 2020 instead of reverting the same to the PNP Pension Fund. The FS agrees with the recommendation to notify the pensioners who were rejected by LBP and expedite the deposit if pensioners are still qualified. Accordingly, the PRBS has been notifying the pensioners whose accounts were rejected by the LBP to update their respective accounts. After which, based on the PRBS request, the FS shall request LBP to credit the pension benefits that were rejected by LBP to the corrected pensioner’s account.









Audit of COVID Funds



1)	Deficiencies were noted in the audit of COVID funds, such as: a) procurements through negotiated procurement-emergency purchase amounting to P18.077 million were not duly supported with proof of posting of the Notice of Award, Contract or Purchase Order, including Notice to Proceed  in the PhilGEPS website, and at any conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in its premises; b) cash advances amounting to P500,000.00 remained unliquidated; and c) payment  of claims was not supported with complete documents contrary to the existing regulations. 



1)	Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11469, otherwise known as “Bayanihan to Heal as one Act” and R.A. No. 11494, “Bayanihan to Recover as One Act” provides the guidelines in procurement of commodities, facilities, utilities and services deemed necessary for COVID-19 response (including personal protective equipment, laboratory equipment and its reagents, medical supplies, etc.) in the most expeditious manner.



2)	For CY 2020, PNP received Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) amounting to P673,422,177.00 and NCA of P646,752,627.00 (net of TRA), with the following details:

5)	COA Circular No. 97-002, which provides that:



4.1.3 A cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served;



5.8.0 All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of the year.



6)	Section 54.3 of the Revised IRR of R.A. 9184 provides:



In all instances of alternative methods of procurement, the BAC, through the Secretariat, shall post, for information purposes, the notice of award, contract or purchase order, including notice to proceed if necessary, in the PhilGEPS website, the website of the procuring entity concerned, if available and at any conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the premises of the Procuring Entity, except for contracts with ABC of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) and below.



1)	It bears emphasis that prolonging the submission of liquidation reports exposes them to risk of loss and deprives the conduct of timely audit and verification as to whether the fund was spent for the purpose for which it was intended.



2)	On the other hand, Sec. 3.6 of the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Circular 01-2020 requires that:



The BAC, through its Secretariat, shall post for information purposes the Notice of Award (NOA), contract, or purchase order in (i) the website of the PE or if none, any conspicuous place in the premises of the PE; and (ii) the GPPB online portal for Emergency Procurement under the Bayanihan Act, once it becomes operational.



3)	Moreover, Section 4.6 of Presidential Decree 1445 provides that “Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.”

4)	The non-posting of the NOA, contract or PO, including NTP in the required websites and places defeated the very purpose of transparency of the procurement activities of the agency.



5)	In addition, in PROs 7, 8 and 13, the supporting documents such as training design, official receipts, abstract of bids, etc. were not attached in the submitted liquidation reports.



6)	We recommended that Management direct the:



	a)	PRO 4B Regional Director (RD) to instruct the Disbursing Officer to prepare and submit the liquidation report together with its supporting documents as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served pursuant to COA Circular No. 97-002; 



	b)	PRO 5 Management to:



i)	instruct the Regional Accountant to require proof of posting of the NOA, contract or PO, including NTP if necessary, in the PhilGEPS website, the website of the procuring entity concerned, if available and at any conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the agency premises for all procurement amounting to more than P 50,000.00; and



ii)	require the BAC Secretariat to comply with the required posting of the NOA, contract or PO, including NTP if necessary, pursuant to the aforementioned provisions of RA 9184; and



	c)	PROs 7, 8 and 13 RDs to instruct the Chiefs of the Regional Comptroller, Finance, Accountant and Disbursing Officers to ensure submission of complete and proper supporting documents to establish the validity, propriety and legality of the payments made in accordance with Section 4(6) of P.D. 1445.





7)	Management commented the following:



Office

Comments

PRO 4B

Liquidation was submitted and recorded under JEV No. 21-02-87 dated Feb 26, 2021 in the amount of P500,000.00.

PRO 5

BAC Secretariat was directed to strictly observe the provision of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184 and the Regional Accountant has issued a Memorandum to the Head of the BAC Secretariat requesting strict compliance with Sec. 54.3 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184 for the succeeding procurements.



The non-posting of the required notices to the PhilGEPS was due to difficulty in accessing the website, which may be caused by systems maintenance or upgrades and slow internet connections. Moreover, the extraordinary situation due to COVID19 merits the immediate procurement of necessary supplies needed by the PNP personnel as frontlines, to uphold its mandate in maintaining peace and order, security and implementation of quarantine protocols.

PRO 7

The mentioned lacking documents were already submitted to the Resident Auditor.



The payments of COVID-related expenses were made through CA in order to address the agency’s  immediate needs/concerns caused by the pandemic. Management assures however that the withholding of applicable taxes shall be imposed in the succeeding procurement.

PRO 13

Liquidating Instruments with complete documentation in the amount of P221,537.00 were already submitted to the Auditor’s office.





Audit of End Local Communist Armed Conflict (ELCAC) Funds



2)	In PRO 5, procurement of goods through shopping amounting to P6.667 Million was not duly supported with documents required in the pertinent provisions of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184. On the other hand, End Local Communist Armed Conflict (ELCAC) funds received by PRO BAR amounting to P40 Million intended for its purpose were not obligated due to non-preparation of project activities or estimated expenses indicating the project objective and expected output caused by time constraint and late release of funds.



1)	In line with EO No. 70 providing for a Whole-of-Nation approach in defeating the Local Communist Terrorist Groups, a National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) was created to synchronize utilization of government's instrumentalities of power with the capabilities of private sector stakeholders to finally end the 50-year long deceit, lies and atrocities committed by the communist terrorists against the people.



2)	The PNP, as a member agency of the Task Force was allocated the amount of P1,084,433,000.00 under RA 11465, otherwise known as the GAA of CY 2020, to cover the funding requirements for ELCAC.



3)	For CY 2020, PNP received a total of P722,955,000.00 with the following details:

Funds were not obligated due to non-preparation of    project activities or estimated expenses indicating project objective and expected output as required in paragraph 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 caused by time constraint and late release of funds.  The SARO was released on the latter part of the year.

NHQ and other PROs

No significant observations noted.





6)	Item IV paragraph E of Annex “H” of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184 states that: 



For alternative methods of procurement, the Procuring Entity may dispense with the advertisement in the newspaper and posting requirement as prescribed in Section 21.2.1 of the IRR of R.A. 9184. For the following alternative methods, however, the BAC, through its Secretariat, shall post the procurement opportunity [e.g., Request for Quotation (RFQ) or Request for Proposal (RFP)] in the Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System (PhilGEPS) website, the website of the Procuring Entity concerned, if available, and at any conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the premises of the Procuring Entity for a period of at least three (3) calendar days: 1) Section 52.1(b) – Shopping for ordinary office supplies and equipment not available in the Department of Budget and Management-Procurement Service (DBM-PS), for projects with Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC) above Fifty Thousand Pesos (₱50,000.00).



7)	Non-compliance with the existing laws, rules and regulations relative to procurements defeated the very purpose of securing information and transparency on the procurement activities of the agency.

a)	Regional Accountant of PRO 5 ensure completeness of required documents before processing of all claims; 



b)	BAC Secretariat comply with the required posting of the RFQ, NOA, contract or PO, including NTP, in the PhilGEPS website and in the website of the procuring entity concerned pursuant to the pertinent provisions of  the IRR of RA 9184; and



c)	PRO BAR Management prepare project activities or estimated expenses indicating project objective and expected output and ensure to utilize the funds in accordance with its intended purpose. 



1)	Management commented the following:



Office

Comments

PRO 5

Management shall undertake necessary actions to observe the recommendations by the Audit Team. 



The non-posting of the required notices by the BAC Secretariat was due to unstable internet connection and difficulty in accessing PhilGEPS website during the period of procurement process because of the successive typhoons (Typhoon Quinta, Rolly and Ulysses) from October to November that struck the Bicol Region and damaged most of telecommunications facilities/network as well as the electricity lines. Also, the PhilGEPS website is under preventive maintenance at the time of posting. BAC Secretariat submitted to COA the advisory on  scheduled system maintenance of the PhilGEPS website, from  6:00 PM of October 23, 2020 to 12:00 AM of  October 24, 2020; and from 6:00 PM of November 27, 2020 to 6:00 AM of December 1, 2020.

 

PRO BAR

The Regional Director already instructed the Command Group of PNP PRO BAR to create an ELCAC Board that would manage proper implementation and utilization of said fund, in accordance with EO No. 70 series 2018.  In addition, the implementation of the 2021 ELCAC fund is already ongoing. With regard to the 2020 ELCAC Fund, management decided to use/utilize  the same if the 2021 ELCAC fund is insufficient.

Gender and Development



2)	PNP accomplished all target activities identified in its Gender and Development (GAD) Plan and Budget; however, the allocated budget of P5.029 Billion or 2.68 percent is short by P4.337 Billion of the mandatory five percent allocation of P9.366 Billion of its P187.329 Billion total appropriations for CY 2020 as required in Section 31 of FY 2020 GAA. 



1)	Section 31 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA states that:

Accordingly, they will ensure implementation and recommendation to the PNP GAD focal person that relevant PAPs will be formulated to maximize the five percent GAD budget of the FY 2021 GAA in the proposed FY 2021 PNP GPB.

This PPOAS aims to assist pensioners in updating their status through the use of information technology. This will save the senior citizens and PWD pensioners from the hassle of going to the NHQ or ROs  just to update their status.



8)	We commend PNP for the implementation of programs and activities which have significantly addressed the issues and concerns of SCs and PWDs.
