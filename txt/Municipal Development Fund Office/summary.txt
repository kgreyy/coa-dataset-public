EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO) was created under the umbrella 

of the Department of Finance (DOF), by virtue of Executive Order (EO) No. 41 dated 

November 20, 1998, to make available to local government units (LGUs) the 

Municipal Development Fund (MDF), a revolving fund created under Presidential 

Decree (PD) No. 1914, dated March 29, 1984.  The MDF is funded from the proceeds 

of foreign loans and assistance or grants to finance specific purpose project 

components and activities of LGUs as set forth in the loan/grant agreements. 
 

Republic Act (RA) No. 11494 known as the “Bayanihan To Recover As One Act” 

affirmed the existence of continuing national emergency due to the Coronavirus 

Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and authorizes the President of the Philippines to exercise 

powers that are necessary and proper to undertake and implement certain COVID-19 

response and recovery interventions.  Pursuant to Section 4 (ttt) of RA No. 11494, 

any unutilized or unreleased balance in the MDF created under PD No. 1914 

including investments and undrawn portions of all loans shall be considered to have 

their purpose abandoned.  

 

The DOF issued the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Section 4 (ttt) of RA 

No. 11494 through Department Circular No. 006-2020 dated December 4, 2020 

relative to the abandonment of purpose and utilization of the balances of the MDF 

and transferred to the Bureau of the Treasury investments in government securities 

amounting to P10 billion. Moreover, Deeds of Assignment dated October 30, 2020 

and December 15, 2020 were executed between the MDFO, as assignor, and Land 

Bank of the Philippines (LBP), as assignee, assigning all balances of the MDF and 

existing loans between MDFO and LGUs.   

 

The agency’s registered office is located at the 4th Floor, Palacio del Gobernador 

Building, General Luna Street, Intramuros, City of Manila. 
 

The MDFO is headed by an Executive Director who is assisted by a Deputy Executive 

Director. As of December 31, 2020, it has seven divisions composed of 26 personnel, 

18 of which are permanent and are organic employees from the Office of the 

Secretary, DOF, six project staff and two outsourced staff.

C. Scope and Objectives of Audit  
 

The audit covered the financial accounts and operations of MDFO for CY 2020.  The 

audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on 

management’s assertion on the financial statements (FSs); (b) determine the agency’s 

compliance with laws, rules, and regulations; (c) recommend agency’s improvement 

opportunities; and, (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit 

recommendations. 

 

 

D. Audit Methodology 
 

We adopted a risk-based approach in the audit of the FSs of the MDFO and in the 

review of compliance with laws, rules, and regulations.  The Audit Team which 

carried out the audit, among others: (i) examined financial and accounting procedures 

adopted by the MDFO and other relevant documentation; (ii) assessed internal 

controls regulating financial operations; (iii) conducted substantive testing of a 

representative sample of selected transactions;  (iv) carried out review, on test check 

basis, of a number of contracts and transactions related to movements in balances of 

assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses; and, (v) conducted interviews and held 

discussions with the concerned officials and staff  in the agency. 

 

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and the 

concerned officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda. 

 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

We rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the FSs of 

MDFO for the year ended December 31, 2020.

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

The audit observations and corresponding recommendations as discussed in Part II 

of this report are summarized below: 

    

1. Funds transferred to local government units (LGUs) totaling P23.354 million for 
the implementation of foreign-assisted projects were not liquidated within the 

prescribed period, thus the completeness and accuracy of the reported balance of 

the Due from Local Government Units of the same amount as at December 31, 

2020 were not determined.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Administrative Officer, Financial Management Division (FMD) to:  (a) 

demand from the concerned LGUs the Certificate of Status of Fund  and 

Statement of Receipts and Disbursements, together with the pertinent 

supporting documents on the utilization of fund transfers already past due 

to recognize liquidation of the fund transfers in the books and any unutilized 

balance; and  (b) demand the refund of any unutilized fund transfers 

considering the lapse of time when the projects should have been 

implemented; and (c) recognize in the books liquidations of fund transfers 

and receipts of unexpended balances, if any. 

 

2. Non-remittance of the balance of the Administrative Fees Fund (AFF) of 
P571.645 million to the BTr, in spite of the abandonment of the purpose of the 

MDF operations and the cessation of its administration by the MDFO under the 

Bayahihan to Recover as One Act, had deprived the National Government (NG) 

of additional funds for its COVID-19 response and recovery interventions, among 

others. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Head of Treasury 

Division to remit immediately to the BTr the balance of the AFF of P571.645 

million deposited with the LBP to help augment the budgetary needs of the 

government  for COVID- 19  response and recovery interventions, among 

others.    

 

3. Unutilized funds transferred to the Procurement Service (PS) for the procurement 
of office supplies and airline tickets totalling P1.576 million as at December 31, 

2020 tied up the funds with the PS, making it unavailable for use by the NG for 

the government’s programs/projects.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief, 

Administrative Officer, FMD to: (a) follow up with the PS the immediate 

refund of advances on undelivered office supplies of P28,218.15; (b) remit to 

the BTr refunds of unutilized balances of advances to the PS immediately 

after receipt; and (c) plan official travel-related activities, where necessary 



 

iv 

 

and appropriate, and implement the same in order to utilize the funds with 

the PS; otherwise, request with the PS the refund of any unutilized funds. 
 

The aforementioned observations and recommendations were discussed with the 

concerned agency officials in a virtual exit conference conducted on March 8, 2021.  

Management’s views and comments were incorporated in the report, where 

appropriate. 

 

 

G. Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges 
 

There were no Notices of Suspension, Disallowance or Charge issued in CY 2020. 

The disallowance of P54,827.30 taken up in the books in CY 2002 remained 

unsettled.  The MDFO’s Motion for Reconsideration dated December 31, 2016 on 

COA Decision No. 2015-339 dated November 26, 2015, denying the request for 

write-off of the subject disallowance, was likewise denied by the COA Commission 

Proper in its letter dated January 20, 2017. 

 

 

H. Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations 
 

For CY 2020, out of the 20 prior years’ recommendations, 14 or 70 per cent, were 

implemented and six, or 30 percent were not implemented. The details are discussed 

in Part III of this report.  

 

We enjoin Management to ensure full implementation of all audit 

recommendations to improve the financial and operational efficiency of the 

agency.
