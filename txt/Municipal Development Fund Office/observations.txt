 OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

Financial Audit 

 

Accounting deficiency 

 

1.  Funds transferred to LGUs totaling P23.354 million for the implementation of 

foreign-assisted projects (FAPs) were not liquidated within the prescribed 

period, thus the completeness and accuracy of the reported balance of the Due 

from Local Government Units of the same amount as at December 31, 2020 were 

not determined.  
 

The Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO), as fund conduit, 

administers foreign-assisted projects (FAPs)/official development assistance (ODA)-

funded projects for implementation by local government units (LGUs). One of these 

projects is the Agrarian Reform Communities Project 2 (ARCP2).  

 

For projects to be implemented, the MDFO and the participating LGUs enter 

into Accession Undertaking (AU). Under the AU, the LGUs are required to liquidate 

any fund transfer within one month from the date of transfer. To liquidate the funds 

transferred, the LGUs prepare and submit the Certificate of Status of Fund (CSF) and 

Statement of Receipts and Disbursements (SORD) together with the pertinent 

supporting documents for the expenses incurred on a monthly basis. At year-end, the 

LGUs submit the Statement of Sources and Application of Funds (SSAF) with the 

corresponding Audit Certificate to the MDFO. 

 

The funds transferred to LGUs for their approved projects are conditional 

grants accounted and recognized under Due from Local Government Units. The 

liquidations of fund transfers for utilization made within a given year are recognized 

under Donations. 

 

As at December 31, 2020, the MDFO reported a subsidiary ledger (SL) balance 

for Due from Local Government Units-ARCP2 of P23.354 million.  Review of the 

MDFO’s Status of Fund Transfers to LGUs disclosed unliquidated fund transfers to 

20 LGUs for 29 sub-projects aged from more than one year to over 7 years, as 

presented in Table 1:

Interview with the ODA Division (ODAD) in charge of the monitoring of the 

submission of reports and review of related liquidation documents for fund transfers 

submitted by LGUs showed that concerned LGUs had difficulty in submitting the 

required reports despite various follow-ups thru e-mails and phone calls, as most of 

these LGUs belong to those with critical peace and order situation and are located in 

remote areas.   

 

It was assured, however, that the MDFO will double its effort to follow up with 

concerned LGUs the full liquidation of the fund transfers in CY 2021.  

   

As liquidation reports and related supporting documents were not submitted as 

at year-end, the expended amounts of fund transfers and the unutilized balances cannot 

be determined, hence, the completeness and accuracy of the reported balance of Due 

from Local Government Units at year-end were not ascertained.      

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Administrative Officer, Financial Management Division (FMD) to:  (a) demand 

from the concerned LGUs the CSF and SRD, together with the pertinent 

supporting documents on the utilization of fund transfers already past due to 

recognize liquidation of the fund transfers in the books and any unutilized 

balance; and  (b) demand the refund of any unutilized fund transfers considering 

the lapse of time when the projects should have been implemented; and (c) 

recognize in the books liquidations of fund transfers and receipts of unexpended 

balances, if any. 

 

 

Compliance Issues 

 

Unremitted administrative fees to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) 

 

2. Non-remittance of the balance of the Administrative Fees Fund (AFF) of P571.645 
million to the BTr, in spite of the abandonment of the purpose of the MDF 

operations and the cessation of its administration by the MDFO under the 

Bayahihan to Recover as One Act, had deprived the National Government (NG) 

of additional funds for its COVID-19 response and recovery interventions, among 

others. 

 

 Section 4 (ttt) of Republic Act (RA) No. 11494  or the Bayanihan to Recover 

As One Act states that any unutilized or unrealeased balance in the MDF, including 

investments and undrawn portions of all loans shall be considered to have their purpose 

abandoned. All such unspent, unutilized, unrealeased or undrawn money or funds shall 

be utilized and are hereby automatically appropriated for LGU loans and borrowings 

from the GFIs.

Paragraph D(8) of the Memorandum dated October 23, 2020 of the Executive 

Secretary authorized the Secretary of Finance to issue rules and regulations to 

implement Section 4 (ttt) of RA No. 11494.  

 

 Pursuant thereto, the DOF issued Department Circular (DC) No. 006-2020 

dated December 4, 2020 to implement rules and regulations on the abandonment of  

the purpose of the MDF and the utilization of the balances of the MDF.  Section 2.0 

of the DC provides the coverage of the MDF to be transfered to the Land Bank of the 

Philippines (LBP) which does not include, among others, the funds kept separately by 

the MDFO in its operations account and administrative fees account, as authorized by 

its Policy Governing Board and the Department of Budget and Management for use in 

its operations. 

 

Section 29(3), Article VI of the Constitution and Executive Order No. 431 

dated May 30, 2005 requires that once the purpose for which a special fund was created 

has been fulfilled or abandoned, the balance, if any, shall be transferred to the general 

fund of the government.  

 

On December 15, 2020, in compliance with the above provisions, the MDFO 

transferred to the LBP various MDF account balances totaling P13.126 million, which 

are either Local Loans Account (LLA) or Program Support Fund (PSF). The details 

are shown in Table 2.

Verification of the MDFO books of accounts as at December 31, 2020 

disclosed that after the transfer of the above accounts to the LBP,  the MDFO still has 

a balance of P709.209 million maintained with  the LBP and recognized under Cash 

in Bank-LCCA, as presented in Table 3:

Total  P709,208,868.07 

 

Analysis of the composition of the account Cash-in-Bank-LCCA showed that 

it consists of balances of ODA projects which are already completed, except for the 

INREMP-ADB, the MOF and AFF. 

 

The MOF is being utilized for the MDFO’s day to day operational expenses, 

while the AFF is authorized to be used for the MDF’s administrative and operational 

expenses for its loaning and borrowing activities with LGUs. The AFF is sourced from 

administrative fees and other charges imposed on LGUs availing of the credit and re-

lending programs under the MDF. As at December 31, 2020, it has a total balance of 

P571.645 million.     

 

Pursuant to Section 4 (ttt) of RA No. 11494, the MDFO has to abandon the 

MDF operations and subsequently transfer the MDF account balances to the LBP. As 

a consequence, the AFF’s purpose to defray the MDF administrative and operational 

expenses has also been abandoned.  

 

As the purpose of the MDF has already been abandoned, the maintenance of 

the AFF is no longer necessary such that any balance should be remitted to the BTr.   

However, the balance of the AFF remained unremitted to the BTr at year-end, hence, 

additional funds had not been made available to the NG for its Coronavirus Disease 

2019 (COVID-19) response and recovery interventions, among others. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Head of 

Treasury Division to remit immediately to the BTr the balance of the AFF of 

P571.645 million deposited with the LBP to help augment the budgetary needs of 

the government for COVID-19 response and recovery interventions, among 

others.    

  

 

Unutilized funds transferred to Procurement Service (PS) for office supplies and airline 

tickets  

 

3. Unutilized funds transferred to the PS for the procurement of office supplies and 
airline tickets totalling P1.576 million as at December 31, 2020 tied up the funds

with the PS, making it unavailable for use by the NG for the government’s 

programs/projects.   

 

As at  December 31, 2020, the SL balance of Due from National Government 

Agencies-PS amounted to P1.576 million. The breakdown with the corresponding age 

is shown in Table 4. 

 
Table 4 - Funds Transferred to PS 

Particulars Amount Year Transferred Age 

Purchase of office supplies           P          591.84  2016 more than 4 years  
        27,626.31  2019 more than 1 year 

Sub-total      28,218.15   

Purchase of airline tickets       954,442.50  2018 more than 2 years  
      593,250.00  2019 more than 1 year 

Sub-total 1,547,692.50   

Total P1,575,910.65   

    
Verification of the Summary of Payments and Deliveries provided by the PS 

disclosed the details of the above balances. According to the Chief Administrative 

Officer, FMD, the total balance of advanced payments for office supplies of 

P28,218.15 remains outstanding due to the non-availability of stocks at the time these 

were ordered. 

 

The Chief Administrative Officer, FMD informed that the balance of the 

advances for office supplies will be refunded by PS directly to the BTr, and that the 

MDFO will be duly informed of the remittance for recognition in the books. 

 

Further, advances for airline tickets of P1.548 million were not fully utilized 

for visits to LGUs for site inspection/evaluation of subprojects funded from the MDF 

due to the abandonement of the MDF’s operation/functions under RA No. 11494. 

 

Relative to the advances for airline tickets, the MDFO commented that it still 

performs other remaining official functions including fund administration and 

monitoring of ODA projects, thus, it has planned to utilize the remaining balance of 

the fund transfer to the PS for monitoring of ODA projects still being administered.  

 

The non-utilization of the funds transferred to the PS, funds are unnecessarily 

tied up with the PS making the same unavailable for the NG’s programs/projects. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief, 

Administrative Officer, FMD to: (a) follow up with the PS the immediate refund 

of advances on undelivered office supplies of P28,218.15; (b) remit to the BTr 

refunds of unutilized balances of advances to the PS immediately after receipt; 

and (c) plan official travel-related activities, where necessary and appropriate, 

and implement the same in order to utilize the funds with the PS; otherwise, 

request from the PS the refund of any unutilized funds.

Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts/Areas 

 

4. COVID-19 Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 
 

For CY 2020, the MDFO had not received funds specifically for COVID-19 

response and/or recovery interventions. Since MDFO personnel are from the 

Department of Finance-Office of the Secretary (DOF-OSEC), expenses relative to 

COVID-19 were covered under the DOF budget. 

 

 

5. Gender and Development (GAD)/ Senior Citizens (SCs), Persons with Disability 
(PWD), and Youth Development 

 

The personnel assigned at the MDFO, being an office under the DOF-OSEC, 

are permanent employees of the DOF, thus, the planning, budgeting, and 

implementation of programs, projects, and activities relating to GAD, SCs, PWDs, and 

youth development were handled by the DOF-OSEC. The MDFO officials and 

employees participated in GAD activities undertaken by DOF-OSEC under office 

orders issued by DOF.  

 

 

6. Tax Laws and Regulations, GSIS and Pag-IBIG Premium Contributions and 
Loan Amortizations, and PhilHealth Premium Contributions 

 

For CY 2020, total taxes withheld for procurement of goods and services of 

hired employees amounted to P90,089.85, of which P60,773.59 was remitted to the 

Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) by the end of CY 2020. As at December 31, 2020, 

the unremitted taxes of P23,316,26 represents taxes withheld for December 2020, 

which were remitted to the BIR on January 11, 2021.  

 

The salaries and other emoluments/benefits of the MDFO personnel are drawn 

from the DOF, thus the remittances of taxes withheld from compensation of MDFO 

regular employees, Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) and Pag-IBIG fund 

premium deductions and loan amortizations, and PhilHealth contributions are the 

responsibilities of the DOF-OSEC. 

 

 

7. GSIS Property Insurance Law 
 

In compliance with RA No. 656, three units of motor vehicles totaling P3.9 

million and one Analog Conference Phone of P28,787.91, purchased in March 2019 

were covered by insurance with premiums paid of P2,973.52 to the GSIS.

8. Hiring of Casuals, Job Orders, Contractuals and Consultants 
 

To augment its work force, the MDFO hired five job order personnel, three of 

whom were funded from the MDFO operations and two from the INREMP, with total 

salaries/wages of P1.775 million for CY 2020, recognized under Other General 

Services.  

 

The MDFO hired the job order personnel in accordance with CSC-COA-DBM 

Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2018.  Audit of the transactions related to the hiring of job order 

personnel for the year did not disclose any significant observation.  

 

 

9. Status of Settlement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges 
 

For CY 2020, there were no Notices of Suspension, Disallowance, and Charge 

issued. The disallowance of P54,827.30 that was taken up in the books in CY 2002 

remained unsettled. The MDFO’s Motion for Reconsideration dated December 31, 

2016 on COA Decision No. 2015-339 dated November 26, 2015, denying the request 

for write-off of the subject disallowance, was likewise denied by the COA Commission 

Proper in its letter dated January 20, 2017.
