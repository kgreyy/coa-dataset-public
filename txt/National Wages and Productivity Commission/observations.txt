PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

Accounting Errors/Omissions 

 

1. Audit of the consolidated financial statements (FSs) of the National Wages and 
Productivity Commission (NWPC) and the Regional Tripartite Wages and 

Productivity Boards (RTWPBs) disclosed that  the same were free from any 

material misstatements and are prepared in accordance with the applicable and 

appropriate financial reporting framework of the International Public Sector 

Accounting Standards (IPSAS); and thus, became the basis in rendering an 

unqualified audit opinion on the financial position of the Commission as at 

December 31, 2020 and its financial performance, cash flows, changes in net 

assets/equity, comparison of budget and actual amounts and notes to financial 

statements for the year then ended. 

 

Other Accounting Deficiencies 

 

Unserviceable Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) not yet disposed 

 

2. Unserviceable PPEs valued at ₱316,543.00 were not yet disposed, of which 
₱117,910.00 was derecognized from the books even without supporting 

Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP), contrary to 

Section 79 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 and Section 39(d) and 40(d), Chapter 

10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government 

Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. 

 

2.1. Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides that “When government property has 
become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon 

application of the officer accountable therefor, be inspected by the head of 

agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor 

concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in 

their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the 

highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or 

similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized 

representative of the Commission, after advertising by printed notice in the 

Official Gazette or for not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper 

of general circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the 

expense of publication, by notices posted for a like period in at least three 

public places in the locality where the property may be sold at a private sale 

at such price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned and 

approved by the Commission.” 

 



 27 

2.2. Section 39 (d), Chapter 10, of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that a 
Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) shall be prepared by the Accounting 

Division/Unit to derecognize the asset from the books of accounts only after 

its disposal. 

 

2.3. Moreover, Section 40(d), of the same Chapter and Manual, states that all 
unserviceable property shall be reported in the IIRUP (Appendix 74). PPE 

reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment 

Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated 

Depreciation). 

 

2.4. Unserviceable PPEs valued at ₱316,543.00 were not yet disposed, of which 
₱117,910.00 with net book value of ₱20,959.94 was derecognized from the 

books even without supporting IIRUP as shown in Table 1.

RTWPB II Unserviceable Property, Plant and Equipment

31, 2020 were not derecognized in the books 

and not yet disposed. 

198,633.00 

Total  316,543.00 

 

2.5. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. submit IIRUP for the derecognized unserviceable properties; 
 

b. dispose of the unserviceable PPEs in accordance with the provisions of 
Section 79 of PD No. 1445; and 

 

c. upon disposal, direct the Accountant to make the necessary adjusting 
entries to derecognize the assets from the books of accounts in 

accordance with Sections 39(d) and 40(d) of Chapter 10 of the GAM 

for NGAs, Volume I.   

 

2.6. Management of RTWPBs I and II committed to comply with the audit 
recommendations. 

 

 

 



 28 

Non-compliance with pertinent rules and regulations on PPE 

 

3. The balances of the PPE account of RTWPB VIII totaling ₱1,781,583.68 as at 
yearend are unreliable due to failure of Management to conduct a complete 

physical count, submit a Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and 

Equipment (RPCPPE) and maintain the prescribed PPE Ledger Cards 

(PPELCs), contrary to Section 42, items (e) and (g) of Chapter 10, GAM for 

NGAs, Volume I. 

 

3.1. Section 42 items (e) and (g) of Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM for NGAs, 
provides: 

 

e.  Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (Appendix 71) – This 

card shall be used for each class of PPE to record the acquisition, 

description, custody, estimated life, depreciation, impairment, 

disposal, transfer/adjustment, repair history and other information 

about the property. It shall be kept and maintained by the Accounting 

Office/Unit. 

 

g. Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and equipment 

(Appendix 73) - this form shall be used to report the physical count 

and condition of PPE by type as at a given date, including those 

which are unrecorded and those which could not be accounted for. It 

shows the balance of PPE per Property Cards and per count and the 

shortage/overage, if any. It shall be rendered by the Inventory 

Committee, the yearly physical count of properties owned by the 

entity. 

 

3.2. It was observed during the audit that: 
 

a. the physical count of PPE was not completely conducted, hence no 
RPCPPE was prepared and submitted to the Audit Team as basis in 

determining  the correctness of PPE account balances presented in the FSs 

as of December 31, 2020; and  

 

b. the Supply/Property Officer does not maintain Property Cards and the 
Accounting Unit does not maintain PPELCs  for all PPEs.  

 

3.3. We recommended the RTWPB VIII Management to: 
 

a. complete the inventory-taking and prepare and submit the RPCPPE 
as of December 31, 2020 to ascertain the existence and conditions of   

the reported PPEs in the books of accounts and correspondingly 

adjust any  noted discrepancies; and 

 



 29 

b. direct the Supply/Property Officer to maintain Property Cards and 
the Accounting Unit to maintain PPELCs for all PPEs. 

 

3.4. Management commented that they issued a Memorandum to the 
Supply/Property Officer to maintain Property Cards for all PPEs as well as to 

prepare and submit the RPCPPE and another Memorandum to the Accountant-

Designate to prepare and maintain the PPELCs to assure that the reported PPE 

are existing, and reliable and that discrepancies that may have been noted 

between the RPCPPE and PPELCs have been verified as soon as possible or in 

the 3rd week of March 2021. 

 

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 

Budget Utilization and CY 2020 Performance on Organizational Outcome 

 

4. Out of the ₱215,454,200.00 allotments received in CY 2020, the Commission 
obligated ₱211,561,012.22 or 98.19 percent, leaving an unobligated balance of 

₱3,893,187.78 or only 1.81 percent unutilized budget as at yearend. Moreover, 

the RTWPBs had accomplished their target programs and activities for the year 

achieving more than 100 percent of their commitments. 

 

4.1. Under the National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated January 6, 2020, 
item 3.4, it is provided that  with the adoption of the Cash Budgeting System 

(CBS) and consistent with Section 60, General Provisions of the FY 2020 

GAA, all appropriations authorized under the FY 2020 GAA, including 

budgetary support to GOCCs and SAGF, shall be available for release and 

disbursement for the purpose specified, and under the same General and 

Special Provisions of said GAA applicable thereto until December 31, 2020. 

The appropriations for Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) 

and Capital Outlay (CO) items under the FY 2020 GAA shall be valid for 

obligation until December 31, 2020. After the end of validity period, all 

unreleased appropriations or unexpended or undisbursed funds shall revert to 

the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund, in accordance with Section 

28, Chapter 4, Book VI of E.O. No. 2922 and shall not be available for 

expenditure except by subsequent legislative enactment. 

 

4.2. NBC No. 580 dated April 22, 2020 on the Adoption of Economy Measure in 
the Government due to Emergency Health Situation, which implement the 

provisions of Sec. 4 of RA No. 11469, directed the government 

instrumentalities that 35% of the programmed appropriations under FY 2020 

GAA shall no longer be  made available for release and discontinuance of  the 

10%  released allotments for MOOE and CO, following economy measures on 

certain  MOOE items. Likewise, government agencies are advised to evaluate 

the discontinuance of programs, projects and activities under the CY 2019 

Continuing Appropriations. 

 



 30 

4.3. Review of the Agency’s Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, 
Obligations, Disbursements, and Balances (SAAODB)-FAR No. 1 for CY 

2020 showed that the Commission received a total allotment of 

₱215,454,200.00 and obligated 98.19 percent or ₱211,561,012.22, thus the 

remaining 1.81 percent or ₱3,893,187.78 was not utilized as of December 31, 

2020. Summary of the Commission’s CY 2020 fund utilization is shown 

below:

4.4. Compared to the last two previous years, allotment utilization rate increased 
while the percentage of unobligated allotments decreased from 2.55 percent in 

CY 2018 to 2.97 percent in CY 2019 and 1.81% percent in CY 2020, as shown 

below:

2018 208,816,000.00 203,485,993.30 97.45 5,330,006.70 2.55 

 

4.5. The current year’s unobligated allotments of ₱3,893,187.78 were mostly 
attributed to unspent PS, MOOE and CO in the amounts of ₱3,542,408.27, 

₱285,767.04, and ₱65,012.47, respectively. The Agency’s unobligated 

allotments for PS were due to unutilized per diems of sectoral representatives 

due to vacant/unfilled positions of sectoral representatives, both of Labor and 

Management representatives, who are appointed by the President of the 

Philippines. For MOOE and CO, the programs were not pursued as indicated 

in the procurement plan because of the restrictions imposed due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

4.6. Further, despite the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
Agency was able to satisfactorily accomplish its plans and targets for CY 



 31 

2020. The Agency continues to perform its function of determining minimum 

wages at the regional, provincial and/or industry levels and promoting 

productivity improvement and gain-sharing schemes, particularly among 

micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). 

 

4.7. NWPC has two Organizational Outcomes for CY 2020, namely: 
 

a. Organizational Outcome: 1 - Capacity of MSMEs to implement 
productivity improvement program enhanced. 

 

Enterprise Productivity Improvement Program - The program focuses on 

productivity improvement of micro, small and medium enterprises or 

MSMEs through a ladderized approach – Productivity Toolbox. It 

emphasizes the need for MSMEs to undergo foundational courses such as 

basic productivity concepts & measurements, 7S of good housekeeping, 

values-based human resource strategy, etc. MSMEs participants are 

required to develop an action plan or Productivity Improvement Plan (PIP) 

for implementation. The action plan/PIP identifies productivity deficits 

and related concerns, as well as recommends solutions. 

 

b. Organizational Outcome: 2 – Fair and reasonable minimum wages in 
accordance with law ensured. 

 

Wage Regulatory Program - The reform defines the policy space for 

minimum wage setting (tier 1) as above the poverty threshold to help 

workers meet basic needs, contribute to poverty reduction (at least among 

the working poor) and help improve income distribution especially at the 

lower end of the pay distribution; but not to exceed average wage to allow 

policy space for bipartite approaches in setting better terms and conditions 

of work. The empirical framework ensures evidence-based minimum 

wage-setting and not one driven by pressure imposed by employers, 

workers, or government. This has resulted in the simplification of wage 

structure and considerably reduced the politics of minimum wage-setting. 

 

4.8. To implement the projects/programs/activities under the Enterprise 
Productivity Improvement Program, NWPC received a total allotment of 

₱93,271,200.00 and obligated/utilized ₱90,800,005.93 or a utilization rate of 

97.35 percent for the year. On the other hand, for the Wage Regulatory 

Program, the Agency received a total allotment of ₱62,405,000.00 and 

obligated/utilized ₱61,049,583.10 or a utilization rate of 97.83 percent.

4.11. For Organizational Outcome 2, the NWPC was able to accomplish more than 
100 percent of its targets except for activity “Conduct of wage 

consultations/public hearings/board deliberations,” for which actual 

accomplishment achieved was only 18.75 percent of the target, due to  the 

restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic as these programs 

require physical interaction with the stakeholders. 

 

4.12. We commended the Management: 
 

a. in its effort in implementing cost-cutting measures and reduction of 
related operating expenses showing an efficient utilization of financial 

resources while ensuring the achievement of the target agency 

performance on its mandate; and 

 

b. for achieving its targets marking a very satisfactory performance in 
carrying out its mandated programs despite the challenges caused by 

the pandemic in CY 2020.  

 

Non-maintenance of Cash Registries and non-submission of financial reports 

 

5. The non-submission of the Purchase Orders, Bank Reconciliation Statements 
(BRS) and/or Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs) by 

RTWPBs VII and VIII to the Audit Team and the  non-maintenance of Cash 

Disbursements Record and Checks and ADA Disbursements Record  and 

improper recording in the  Report of Checks Issued / Report of ADA Issued in  

RTWPB V are contrary to the pertinent provisions of GAM for NGAs, Volume 1 

and other related COA Circulars/regulations.  

 

5.1. Sections 10 and 17 of Chapter 6, Volume I of the Manual states that: 
 

Section 17. – The Disbursing Officer shall maintain the Cash 

Disbursements Record (CDRec) (Appendix 40) to monitor the cash 

advances/payroll, current operating expenses, and special purpose/time-

bound undertakings and prepare the Report of Cash Disbursements 

(RCDisb) (Appendix 41) to report its utilization. x x x 

 



 34 

Section 10. – All checks drawn during the day, whether released or 

unreleased including cancelled checks shall be recorded chronologically 

in the Checks and ADA Disbursements Record (CkADADRec) 

(Appendix 34) maintained by the Cash/Treasury Unit. The dates the 

checks were actually released shall be indicated in the appropriate 

column provided for in the CkADADRec. All checks/ADA drawn 

whether released or unreleased shall be included in the Report of Checks 

Issued (RCI) (Appendix 35) or Report of ADA Issued (RADAI) 

(Appendix 13), which shall be prepared daily by the Cashier. The 

RCI/RADAI together with the original copies of the supporting 

documents (SDs) shall be submitted to the Accounting Division/Unit for 

the preparation of JEV (Appendix 36). x x x 

 

5.2. Whereas Sections 4, 5 and 7 of Chapter 21, Volume I of the Manual state,  viz: 
 

Section 4. The monthly BRS shall be prepared by the Chief 

Accountant/designated staff for each of the bank accounts maintained by 

the agency/entity using the Adjusted Balance Method. Under this 

method, the book balance and the bank balance are brought to an 

adjusted cash balance that must appear on the Statement of Financial 

Position. 

 

Section 5. The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days 

from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid 

checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda 

(CM) from the GSB, reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the BRS 

in four copies. 

 

Section 7. The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty 

days after receipt of the monthly BS to the following:  

 

Original – COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents and JEVs)  

Copy 2 – Head of Agency/Entity  

Copy 3 – Accounting Division/Unit file  

Copy 4 – Bank, if necessary 

 

5.3. COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 states that:  
 

Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the 

government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, 

including government-owned and controlled corporations and their 

subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents 

forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to 

the Auditor of the agency concerned. 

 



 35 

A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and 

every supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days from 

issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned. 

 

5.4. COA and DBM Joint Circular No. 2014-1 dated July 2, 2014 requires that all 
departments/agencies/OUs shall observe the following timelines in submitting 

the required Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs) to COA 

and DBM: 

 

• Within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter

- ADDO – FAR No. 3 

 

• On or before 30th day of the following month covered by the report 
- MRD - FAR No. 4 

 

5.5. The following RTWPBs failed to observe the required submission/ 
maintenance of the following accounting reports: 

 

Office Observation 

RTWPB V The Cash Unit did not maintain the required CkADADRec 

and the CDRec and prepare properly the reports as required 

under the GAM for NGAs. The recording of the Checks and 

ADAs in the RCI and RADAI were not chronologically 

arranged as required, and there were instances when the 

details of a check disbursement were not properly recorded to 

the corresponding check or ADA number, thus, causing 

difficulty in the proper accounting of the Checks and ADA 

issued during the period. 

RTWPB 

VII 

Perfected Contracts, Purchase Orders (POs) for CY 2020 and 

their supporting documents were not submitted to the Office 

of the Auditor within five (5) days from their issuance, 

contrary to COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 

2009, thereby precluding timely audit and technical review. 

RTWPB 

VIII 

Submission of BFARs to COA Office required under COA 

and DBM Joint Circular No. 2014-1 dated July 2, 2014 was 

not done regularly by concerned agency officials, thus  the 

Audit Team was not able to render a timely audit of the 

utilization of appropriations/allotment vis-a-vis the evaluation 



 36 

Office Observation 

of the Agency’s actual performance against its plans and 

targets. 

The Monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) for CY 

2020 by the Agency’s Accounting Unit were not submitted 

contrary to Section 74 of PD No. 1445 and pertinent 

provisions of Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1, 

hence the Audit Team was not able to ascertain the accuracy 

and reliability of Cash – Modified Disbursement System 

(MDS) account as of December 31, 2020. 

 

5.6. We recommended to the Management of: 
 

a. RTWPB V to require the Cashier to comply with the proper 
maintenance of the prescribed CkADADRec and the CDRec, the 

preparation of the RCI to be submitted to the Accounting Unit and 

Audit Team; and to record the checks and ADAs in the RCI and 

RADAI chronologically as they are issued. 

 

b. RTWPB VII to direct the Supply/Property Officer to furnish the COA 
Office with copies of the perfected contract/POs, together with the 

complete supporting documents, within five (5) days after 

execution/issuance. 

 

c. RTWPB VIII to: 
 

c.1. direct the Budget Officer and Accountant to strictly observe the 
timely submission of BFARs to the Audit Team, pursuant to 

COA and DBM Joint Circular No. 2014-1 dated July 2, 2014 ; 

 

c.2. enroll in an online banking services, where Bank Statement 
information can readily be obtained at any time and facilitate the 

timely preparation of the BRS; and 

 

c.3. cause the timely preparation of the monthly BRS so that 
errors/omissions and/or reconciling items would be immediately 

detected for corrections and adjustments in the books of 

accounts, thus ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the Cash 

account balances in the Agency’s financial Statements. 

 

Delayed/Non-submission of Disbursement Vouchers (DVs)  

 

6. DVs, Payrolls and the supporting documents for the months of September to 
December 2020 were not submitted by RTWPB VIII as of yearend in violation of 

Section 122 of PD No. 1445, Sections 7.1.1 and 7.2.1(a) of COA Circular No. 



 37 

2009-006, hence validity, regularity, and propriety of the transactions were not 

ascertained. 

 

6.1. Section 122 of PD No. 1445 provides that: 
 

Submission of Reports. – Whenever deemed necessary in the 

exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued 

by it require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, 

cashiers, disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, and 

other responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial 

balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and 

such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its 

functions. (Emphasis ours) 

 

(2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the 

documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the 

suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have complied 

with the requirements of the Commission. 

 

6.2. On the other hand, Sections 7.1.1 and 7.2.1(a) of COA Circular No. 2009-006 
states the following: 

 

7.1.1. The head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all 
government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall 

ensure that: (a) the required financial and other reports and 

statements are submitted by the concerned agency officials in 

such form and within the period prescribed by the commission; 

(b) the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within 

the prescribed period; (c) the requirements of transactions 

suspended in audit are complied with; and (d) appropriate actions 

are taken on the deficiencies noted as contained in the AOM. 

 

7.2.1. The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official 
performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited 

agency shall ensure that: 

 

a) The reports and supporting documents submitted by the AOs are 

submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the 

ensuing month. 

 

6.3. In RTWPB VIII, Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) of undetermined quantity and 
amounts, for the months of September to December 2020 and their supporting 

documents  were not submitted at yearend to the  Audit Team which precluded 

the Audit Team from conducting the audit of the transactions.  Thus, the 

validity, regularity, correctness and propriety of the disbursements/expenses 



 38 

was not be ascertained and it renders the balances of the affected accounts 

doubtful. 

 

6.4. We recommended the Management of RTWPB VIII to: 
 

a. instruct the Accountant (Designate) to immediately submit all 
unsubmitted DVs and their supporting documents to the Audit Team 

and the Disbursing Officer to observe the timely submission of his 

accounts to the Accounting Section; and 

 

b. suspend the payment of salaries and emoluments of the Accountant-
Designate until she has complied with the requirements of COA 

pursuant to Section 122 of PD No. 1445. Administrative disciplinary 

action may also be imposed under Section 55, Chapter 10, Title 1.B, 

Book V of Executive Order No. 292 the Administrative Code of 1987. 

 

6.5. Management of RTWPB VIII committed to comply with the audit 
recommendations. 

 

Lacking documentation of disbursements and DVs not stamped “Paid” 

 

7. Disbursements of four RTWPBs amounting to ₱1,033,220.69 were made either 
without or with incomplete documentary requirements, contrary to Section 4(6) 

of Presidential Decree No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001; and the DVs 

were not stamped “PAID” in RTWPB II which is not in conformity with COA 

Circular No. 92-389. 

  

7.1. Section 4(6) of Presidential Decree No. 1445 provides that “All claims against 
government funds shall be supported with complete documentation”. 

 

7.2. COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribes the documentary 
requirements for all types of Disbursement. Generally, it requires the 

availability of funds; the legality of transaction and its conformity with laws, 

rules or regulations; the approval by the Head of Office or his authorized 

representative; and the presence of sufficient and relevant documents to 

establish the validity of claim. 

 

7.3. Paragraph 2.Q of COA Circular No. 92-389 states that “paid vouchers, 
including its supporting documents, shall be perforated and conspicuously 

stamped ‘Paid’ by the Cashier. The stamp shall provide space for the number 

of the check issued and date of actual payment, and its size should be 2" X 

3".” 

 

7.4. Disbursements for expenses for CY 2020 in four RTWPBs were found to have 
lacking supporting documents, as shown in Table 4.

Table 4.  Findings on Incomplete Documentation of Disbursements 

Office Observation 
Amount 

(In PhP) 

RTWPB V The validity, propriety and accuracy of claims for 

repairs and maintenance of motor vehicles and meals 

and snacks during webinars of the Agency as of 

December 31, 2020 cannot be ascertained due to 

incomplete/insufficient supporting documents such as 

job order/contract, request for payment, invoices, and 

post-inspection report.   

164,789.22 

RTWPB VI Disbursements were either not supported with complete 

documentation or with incomplete entries of the required 

information in the supporting documents, detailed as 

follows: 

a. Inspection Acceptance Reports (IAR) were either 
not attached to the DV or if attached, they were 

not properly filled up. 

b. Request for Quotations (RFQs) were not dated 
and no specific dates for the submission of price 

quotations were indicated. 

c. Lacking and/or undated Delivery Receipts 
(DRs). 

d. Charge Sales Invoice (CSI) not dated. 

723,875.47 

RTWPB VII Payments for repairs and maintenance in CY 2020 were 

made without post-inspection report, warranty 

certificate, request for payment, invoices, certificate of 

acceptance and pre-repair inspection reports thereby 

precluding the Auditor to validate the propriety of the 

repairs made.  

105,556.06 

RTWPB VIII Payments for COVID-19 Hazard Pay to employees were 

made despite the failure to submit authorization from the 

head of the agency to physically report at their 

respective offices or workstation on the prescribed 

official working hours during the implementation of 

Enhanced Community Quarantine measure in the area of 

such office or workstation. 

39,000.00 

Total  1,033,220.69 

 

7.5. On the other hand, DVs, payrolls and the corresponding supporting documents 
were not stamped “PAID” in RTWPB II. Non-stamping of the DVs and 

supporting documents increases the risk of double payment and using the same 

documents to support other claims. 

 

7.6. We recommended the Management of: 
 

a. RTWPB V to: 



 40 

 

a.1. submit the documentary requirements for the claims for repairs 
and maintenance of vehicles and for the meals and snacks during 

webinars as provided under COA Circular No. 2012-001; 

 

a.2. direct the concerned employees/ units requesting/processing the 
claim for repair of vehicle to specify in the supporting documents 

the vehicle type and the plate number of the vehicle subject for 

repair; and 

 

a.3. instruct the Accountant-Designate to refrain from processing 
claims lacking with the required supporting documents. 

 

b. RTWPB VI to: 
 

b.1. ensure that the requirements on the filling up of required 
data/information on procurement/delivery documents are 

strictly complied with; and 

 

b.2. ensure that supporting documents are complete prior to 
processing of the payment expenses/claims. 

 

c. RTWPB VII to direct the end-users of the equipment requested to be 
repaired, to properly accomplish and submit the documentary 

requirements as required under COA Circular No. 2012-001. 

 

d. RTWPB VIII to strictly adhere to existing rules and regulations on 
the payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay. 

 

e. RTWPB II to instruct the Cashier to stamp “PAID” the DVs 
including the supporting documents pursuant to COA Circular No. 

92-389 to prevent and ensure that no double payment or re-use of 

supporting documents will happen; 

 

7.7. The following are the Management’s comments and the corresponding 
Auditor’s Rejoinder:

OTHER COMPLIANCE ISSUES 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

8. The implementation of GAD related programs, projects and activities  in NWPC 
was not fully carried out as required in Section 31 of the General Provisions of 

the GAA for FY 2020 in view of the following: (a) GAD funds allocation in 

NWPC-CO and RTWPB NCR were below the  minimum five percent of 

appropriation by attribution and like in RTWPBs II, III, V and X, their 

reported GAD expenses as well; (b) unclear GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for 

implementation by each RTWP, hence no basis for evaluating the RTWPB GAD 

accomplishments; and (c) no GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) submitted by 

some RTWPBs.  



 42 

8.1. Section 31 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, the GAA for FY 2020, 
on Programs and Projects Related to GAD, provides as follows: 

 

The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 

agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. For 

this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which 

relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic 

empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, 

and fulfilment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-

responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said 

requirement.  Utilization of GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the 

GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies. 

 

The preparations and submission of the annual GAD Plan and annual 

GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) shall be subject to the guidelines 

issued by the agencies concerned. 

 

8.2. Section 4.4 of Joint Circular No. 2012-01 of the Philippine Commission on 
Women, National Economic and Development Authority, and DBM (PCW-

NEDA-DBM) on the institutionalization of the GAD Database/Sex-

disaggregated Data states that the agency shall develop or integrate in its 

existing database GAD information to include gender statistics and sex-

disaggregated data that have been systematically produced or gathered as 

inputs or bases for planning, budgeting, programming, and policy formulation. 

 

8.3. Further, Section 6 of the same Circular, which provides for the guidelines in 
costing and allocation of the GAD budget, states that “if an agency intends to 

attribute a portion or the whole budget of major programs during the GAD 

planning and budgeting phase, it may subject the program to gender analysis 

using the HGDG tool.” Section 6.4.4 states that “during the preparation of its 

GAD AR, the agency will again administer the HGDG test to determine the 

extent that the targeted HGDG score is attained. This score will be the basis in 

determining actual expenditure that can be attributed to the GAD budget.” 

 

8.4. GAD Fund Budget and utilization of NWPC CO and RTWPBs are shown

8.5. Based on the CY 2020 NWPC appropriations, the Agency should have a 
minimum GAD allocation of ₱10,772,710.00 by attribution to its regular 

agency programs/projects/activities. Regional audit reports, however, showed 

that GAD funds allocation and reported GAD expenses were below the 

minimum five percent of appropriation. Furthermore, there was unclear GPB 

for implementation by each assigned RTWPB, hence there was no basis for 

evaluating the RTWPB GAD accomplishments and utilization of GAD 

Budgets, and RTWPBs IV-A, IV-B, VII and XIII had not submitted the 

required GAD ARs. The following deficiencies were reported in the 

implementation of GAD Activities in the various RTWPBs: 

 

Table 6.  Deficiencies Noted in the Implementation of GAD 
RTWPB Observations 

NCR RTWPB-NCR’s GAD activities contained in the GAD AR with 

₱280,000.00 fund utilization or 3.03 percent of their total FY 

2020 Appropriations were implemented below the 5% 

requirement under Section 32 of the GAA. 

IV-A The Management only submitted the GPB for CY 2020 of the 

whole NWPC. The Management is yet to submit their own GPB 

and GAD AR for CY 2020, despite multiple request, contrary to 

the provisions of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01. 

IV-B The Agency’s GAD accomplishments vis-à-vis targeted activities 

for CY 2020 cannot be evaluated due to the non-submission of 

GAD AR as required under Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-

001 dated March 18, 2014, thus proper utilization of funds could 

not be ascertained. 

VII The Management failed to integrate in their regular activities for 

the GAD Plan at least five percent (5%) of their budgets, in 

violation of Section 31 of the General Provisions of FY 2020 

GAA. 

XI Non-preparation of the GPB in the Region due to mere reliance 

on the NWPC-CO prepared GPB for the whole NWPC and the 



 44 

RTWPB Observations 

incurrence of expenditures amounting to ₱8,800.00, which could 

not be clearly attributed to the PAPs and budget for the RTWPB 

XI contravened pertinent provisions of PCW Memorandum 

Circular No. 2011-01 and PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint 

Memorandum Circular No. 2012-01, thus resulting in the 

inability to identify and address the gender issues affecting 

RTWPB XI’s own stakeholders as well as rendering questions on 

the validity of the expenditures incurred. 

I, IV-A, IV-B,  

VI,VII, VIII 

and XIII 

No data were presented on the GPB and GAD AR for each 

respective RTWPB. GAD AR submitted for RTWPB I, VI and 

VIII but no GPB, hence there was no basis for evaluation of 

accomplishments.  

 

8.6. We recommended the Management to: 
 

NWPC- CO 

 

a. improve the GAD planning and budgeting by involving the RTWPBs 
in the overall Agency GPB for PCW endorsement;  

 

b. organize the GAD Focal Point System in the RTWPBs to jumpstart an 
organization-wide effort to prepare and implement the Region’s GPB; 

 

c. ensure conduct of discussion/orientation of PCW-approved GPB to 
enable participation and compliance by RTWPBs in the 

accomplishment of GAD targets, plans and programs in accordance 

with the approved GPB. 
 

RTWPBs 

 

d. require the Focal Persons to submit the GAD AR to NWPC-CO, copy 
furnished the Audit Team, as basis of the latter in the evaluation, 

whether GAD activities undertaken during the year had effectively 

addressed the identified gender issue, in adherence to Item V of COA 

Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014. 

 

 

Remittances to GSIS, BIR, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG Fund 

 

9. For CY 2020, the NWPC and its Regional Boards had deducted from the salaries 
of its personnel the required taxes and GSIS, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG 

premiums and remitted the same, as well as the government share, within the 

prescribed periods to the concerned institutions or agencies as summarized in 

Table 7. 

 



 45 

9.1. The following laws, rules and regulations govern the deductions and 
remittance required by the BIR, GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth:  

 

a. BIR Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98 issued on May 17, 1998 provides 
for the withholding of income tax subject to expanded withholding tax 

(EWT), final withholding tax (FWT), income tax on compensation, 

creditable value-added tax (VAT) and other percentage taxes.  

 

b. Revenue Regulations No. 17-2003 dated March 31, 2003, amending 
pertinent provisions of Revenue Regulations No. 2-98, required that all 

taxes withheld and payable to the BIR shall be remitted on or before the 

10th day of the month following the month withholding was made, except 

for taxes withheld for the month of December which shall be filed on or 

before the 15th day of the succeeding year. 

 

c. Section 6 of RA No. 8291 thereof prescribes the collection and remittance 
of contributions of the employer to GSIS. It states that “The employer shall 

deduct each month from the monthly salary or compensation of each 

employee the contribution payable by him in accordance with the schedule 

prescribed in the rules and regulations implementing this Act.” 

  

d. HDMF Circular No. 275 - Implementing Guidelines on Employer 
Registration, Contribution and Remittance under RA 9679, Item E (1) on 

Remittance of Contributions and Employees’ Loan Amortizations, states 

that “The employer shall act as agent both of the Fund and the employee. 

Said employer shall collect, through salary deduction, the monthly 

contributions of his/her employees and remit the same to the Fund together 

with the employer counterpart.” 

  

e. Section 18 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA No. 7875, 
otherwise known as the National Health Insurance Act of 2013, on 

Payment of Premium Contributions, states that “For government agencies, 

it shall be mandatory and compulsory for the employers to include the 

payment of contributions in their annual appropriations. The use of said 

funds withheld by government agencies other than for the purpose of 

remitting Program contributions will hold the erring government 

employers liable under the pertinent provisions of the Revised Penal 

Code.”

Implementation of programs for Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability  

 

10. NWPC-CO and the 16 RTWPBs had formulated plans, programs and activities 
related to Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs), which were 

integrated in their regular activities and implemented in accordance with 

Section 32 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA. 

 

10.1. Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 states that: 
 

All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and 

projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons 

with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and 

integrate the same in their regular activities. 

 

Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide 

architectural or structural features, designs, or facilities that will 

reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with 

disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and R.A. No. 7277. 
 

10.2. The NWPC-CO and the 16 RTWPBs had formulated an Agency Plan for SCs
