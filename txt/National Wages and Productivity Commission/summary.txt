D. Scope of Audit 
 

 The audit covered the review of accounts and operations of the NWPC-Central 

Office and RTWPB Offices for CY 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level 

of assurance that maybe placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements, 

(b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with 

applicable laws, rules and regulations, and (c) determine the extent of implementations of 

prior years’ audit recommendations.

 The Auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of 

the financial statements of the NWPC for CY 2020 as stated in the Independent Auditor’s 

Report and discussed in Part II of the Report. 

 

 

F. Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

 The following are among the significant audit observations and recommendations, 

among others, the details are discussed in Part II of the Report: 

                   

 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PPE) 

 

1. Unserviceable PPEs valued at ₱316,543.00 were not yet disposed, of which 
₱117,910.00 was derecognized from the books even without supporting 

Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP), contrary 
to Section 79 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 and Sections 39(d) and 40(d), 

Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 

Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. (Observation No. 2) 



vi 
 

   

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. submit IIRUP for the derecognized unserviceable properties; 
 

b. dispose of the unserviceable PPEs in accordance with the provisions of 
Section 79 of PD No. 1445; and 

 

c. upon disposal, direct the Accountant to make the necessary adjusting 
entries to derecognize the assets from the books of accounts in 

accordance with Sections 39(d) and 40(d) of Chapter 10 of the GAM 

for NGAs, Volume I.   

 

2. The balances of the PPE account of RTWPB VIII totaling ₱1,781,583.68 as at 
yearend are unreliable due to failure of Management to conduct a complete 

physical count, submit a Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and 

Equipment (RPCPPE) and maintain the prescribed PPE Ledger Cards 

(PPELCs), contrary to Section 42, items (e) and (g) of Chapter 10, GAM for 

NGAs, Volume I. (Observation No. 3)  

 

We recommended the RTWPB VIII Management to: a) complete the 

inventory-taking and prepare and submit the RPCPPE as of December 

31, 2020 to ascertain the existence and conditions of   the reported PPEs 

in the books of accounts and correspondingly adjust any noted 

discrepancies; and b) direct the Supply/Property Officer to maintain 

Property Cards and the Accounting Unit the mandated PPE Ledger 

Cards (PPELCs) for all PPEs.   

 

3. DVs, Payrolls and the supporting documents for the months of September to 
December 2020 were not submitted by RTWPB VIII as of yearend, in 

violation of Section 122 of PD No. 1445, Sections 7.1.1 and 7.2.1(a) of COA 

Circular No. 2009-006, hence validity, regularity, and propriety of the 

transactions were not ascertained. (Observation No. 6) 

 

We recommended the RTWPB VIII Management to: a) instruct the 

Accountant (Designate) to immediately submit all unsubmitted DVs and 

their supporting documents to the Audit Team and the Disbursing 

Officer to observe the timely submission of his accounts to the Accounting 

Section; and b) suspend the payment of salaries and emoluments of the 

Accountant-Designate until she has complied with the requirements of 

COA pursuant to Section 122 of PD No. 1445. Administrative disciplinary 

action may also be imposed under Section 55, Chapter 10, Title 1.B, Book 

V of Executive Order No. 292 the Administrative Code of 1987.  

 

 

 



vii 
 

EXPENSES 

 

4. Disbursements of four RTWPBs amounting to ₱1,033,220.69 were made 
either without or with incomplete documentary requirements, contrary to 

Section 4(6) of Presidential Decree No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-

001; and the DVs were not stamped “PAID” in RTWPB II which is not in 

conformity with COA Circular No. 92-389. (Observation No. 7) 

 

We recommended the Management of: 

 

a. RTWPB V to: 
 

a.1. submit the documentary requirements for the claims for repairs 
and maintenance of vehicles and for the meals and snacks during 

webinars as provided under COA Circular No. 2012-001; 

 

a.2. direct the concerned employees/ units requesting/processing the 
claim for repair of vehicle to specify in the supporting documents 

the vehicle type and the plate number of the vehicle subject for 

repair; and 

 

a.3. instruct the Accountant-Designate to refrain from processing 
claims lacking with the required supporting documents. 

 

b. RTWPB VI to: 
 

b.1. ensure that the requirements on the filling up of required 
data/information on procurement/delivery documents are 

strictly complied with; and 

 

b.2. ensure that supporting documents are complete prior to 
processing of the payment expenses/claims. 

 

c. RTWPB VII to direct the end-users of the equipment requested to be 
repaired, to properly accomplish and submit the documentary 

requirements as required under COA Circular No. 2012-001. 

 

d. RTWPB VIII to strictly adhere to existing rules and regulations on 
the payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay. 

 

e. RTWPB II to instruct the Cashier to stamp “PAID” the DVs 
including the supporting documents pursuant to COA Circular No. 

92-389 to prevent and ensure that no double payment or re-use of

GAD Program 

 

5. The implementation of GAD related programs, projects and activities  in 
NWPC was not fully carried out as required in Section 31 of the General 

Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 in view of the following: (a) GAD funds 

allocation in NWPC-CO and RTWPB NCR were below the  minimum five 

percent of appropriation by attribution and like in RTWPBs II, III, V and X, 

their reported GAD expenses as well; (b) unclear GAD Plan and Budget 

(GPB) for implementation by each RTWP, hence no basis for evaluating the 

RTWPB GAD accomplishments; and (c) no GAD Accomplishment Report 

(AR) submitted by some RTWPBs. (Observation No. 8) 

 

We recommended the Management to: 

 

NWPC- CO 

 

a. improve the GAD planning and budgeting by involving the RTWPBs 
in the overall Agency GPB for PCW endorsement;  

 

b. organize the GAD Focal Point System in the RTWPBs to jumpstart an 
organization-wide effort to prepare and implement the Region’s GPB; 

 

c. ensure conduct of discussion/orientation of PCW-approved GPB to 
enable participation and compliance by RTWPBs in the 

accomplishment of GAD targets, plans and programs in accordance 

with the approved GPB. 

 

RTWPBs 

 

d. require the Focal Persons to submit the GAD AR to NWPC-CO, copy 
furnished the Audit Team, as basis of the latter in the evaluation, 

whether GAD activities undertaken during the year had effectively 

addressed the identified gender issue, in adherence to Item V of COA 

Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014. 

 

 

 The foregoing audit observations and recommendations were communicated 

through Audit Observation Memoranda (AOMs) and discussed with Management 

officials in a virtual Exit Conference conducted on June 28, 2021 and their comments 

were incorporated in this Report, where appropriate.
