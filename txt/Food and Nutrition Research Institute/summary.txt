C. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial and compliance audits of the accounts and 

operations of the FNRI for the year ended December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted 

to: (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions 

on the financial statements; (b) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; (c) 

determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with 



iii 
 

pertinent laws, rules and regulations; and (d) determine the extent of implementation 

of prior year’s audit recommendations.  

 

D. Independent Auditor’s Report 
 

An unqualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements of the FNRI 

as of December 31, 2020. 

 

E. Summary of Other Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The observations and recommendations, discussed in detail in Part II of the 

report, are shown below: 

 

Financial Audit 

  

1. Reconciling items totaling P0.938 million representing unidentified 

deposits/collections in CY 2019-2020 were recognized in the books as Other 

Unearned Revenue without adequate supporting documents and proper 

establishment of its nature and purpose, thus, affecting the reliability of the Cash in 

Bank - LCCA and Other Unearned Revenue by the same amount of P0.938 million.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

 

a) ensure that all cash transactions in the books are properly validated 

specific to its nature and purpose, and adequately supported with complete 

documents; 

b) coordinate with the concerned office/s and install control measures on 

securing the MOA/documentations to immediately determine the nature of 

the CMs in the bank statements; and 

c) exert effort to identify the nature of the amount P938,486.79 and 

immediately effect the necessary adjustment. Any undetermined balance 

should be dropped from the books and reported back in the BRS, or assess 

whether reversion to the Bureau of the Treasury is warranted.  

 

2. Identified gaps noted in the collections and deposits process such as: a) official 

receipts (ORs) were not issued and reported in strict numerical sequence per Report 

of Collections and Deposits (RCDs) as well as use of one series or booklet of ORs 

for all collections regardless of fund cluster; b) inability to deposit intact all 

collections for the day; c) non-use and/or non-preparation of prescribed 

forms/reports daily; and various errors in recording of transactions in the books of 

accounts, thus, resulting in the doubtful balance of the Cash-Collecting Officer 

account of P9,707.98. 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 



iv 
 

a) Collecting Officer to: 
 

i) use separate series or booklet of ORs for each fund/book  (RA and TF) 
so that the issuance and reporting of ORs in the RCDs are consistently 

sequential to facilitate ease and proper monitoring of the issuances of 

ORs and recording of collections and deposits in the books; 

ii) ensure that ORs are issued in strict numerical sequence for each 
fund/book; and 

iii) deposit intact all collections of the day on the same day or the next 
banking day, prepare and submit the corresponding RCDs on a daily 

basis to the Accountant, and maintain CRRec to monitor daily 

collections and deposits made; 

 

b) he Accountant to: 
 

i) review and verify records to determine the breakdown and particulars 
of the unadjusted balance of P9,707.98. Failure to identify the same 

may result to a refund in favor of the government as it is 

considered/reflected as undeposited collections in the books; and 

ii) be more prudent in recording the transactions and ensure that the 
same are properly reported in its respective books of accounts; and  

 

c) the Accountant and the Collecting Officer to conduct reconciliation of 
records regularly to immediately correct any discrepancy. 

 

Compliance Audit 

3. Excess proceeds of P16,935.18 derived from the conduct of trainings were not 

remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) in violation of Section 12 of RA No. 

11465 known as the General Appropriations Act of FY2020.  

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to be 

more prudent in recording transactions, remit to the BTr any excess proceeds 

derived from the conduct of trainings, and henceforth, strictly enforce the 

provisions of Section 12 of RA 11465.  

 

4. The Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable account of P2.716 million included 
payables of P0.936 million or 34%, which remained outstanding/unclaimed for two 

(2) years or more, contrary to Section 1 of Executive Order No.87 and Section 98 

of Presidential Decree No. 1445. 

 

We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation and Management agreed to 

instruct the Accountant to continuously inform in writing the payee/supplier 

to claim their outstanding accounts, otherwise, make a necessary accounting 

entry to recognize the automatic reversion of payables which remain 

outstanding for two (2) years or more to the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit of the 

general fund. 



v 
 

 

5. Cancelled stale checks totaling ₱5,391.06 remained outstanding carried over in 
books for over two years and not yet reverted to the Accumulated surplus contrary 

to Section 97 of PD 1445.    

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

 

a) verify the status and validity of the cancelled stale checks and coordinate 
with creditors to facilitate settlement of the balance; otherwise, directly 

remit to the BTr as deemed necessary; and 

 

b) transfer/revert to the Accumulated Surplus the amounts of issued checks 
that remained outstanding for more than two (2) years as provided for in 

Section 97 of PD 1445. 

 

 A Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations (SAOR) for CY 
2020 and Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations for CY 

2019 were transmitted to Management on and their comments were incorporated in this 

report, where appropriate. 

 

F. Enforcement of Disallowances, Charges and Suspensions 
 

A Notice of Disallowance (ND) was issued on November 19, 2012 on honoraria 

received by FNRI Officers and Employees in CY 2011 exceeding 25 percent of their 

annual salary. The appeal was applied with the Commission on Audit (COA) on 

February 27, 2013. Another disallowance was issued on July 31, 2018 on the payment 

of CY2017 honoraria. NDs were issued for the CY 2015, 2016 and 2017 Longevity 

Pay (LP) overpayment whereby it was not in consonance with the guidelines of DBM-

DOST JC No.1, series of 2013 which resulted in the overpayment of LP benefit. During 

the year, ND was issued for over payment of claim for the terminal benefits in CY 

2019.
