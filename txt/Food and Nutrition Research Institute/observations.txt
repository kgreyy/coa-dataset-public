PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

Financial Audit 
 

Accounting Deficiencies 
 
1. The Statements of Financial Position and Performance of the Food and 
Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI) as at December 31, 2020 were fairly presented, 

except for the deficiencies found in Cash and Cash Equivalents and Deferred 
Credits/Unearned Income accounts amounting to P0.948 million which represents 0.21 
percent of the total assets of the Institute as at year-end. 

 

2. In our audit of the Agency’s accounts, we noted the following deficiencies which 
were not adjusted as at year-end, thus, affecting the accuracy, reliability and accountability 
of the affected FS accounts:

3. Reconciling items totaling P0.938 million representing unidentified 
deposits/collections in CY 2019-2020 were recognized in the books as Other Unearned 
Revenue without adequate supporting documents and proper establishment of its 
nature and purpose, thus, affecting the reliability of the Cash in Bank - LCCA and 
Other Unearned Revenue by the same amount of P0.938 million.

4. Section 6, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I 
states that “an entity shall present information including accounting policies in a manner 
that meets the following qualitative characteristics enumerated in PPSAS 1,” and included 
therein  under Section 6e thereof is “reliability” which provides that “reliable information 
is free from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully 
that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.”  

 
5. Section 30, Chapter 5 of the GAM, Volume I on “Advance Receipts of Revenue” 
states that “when an entity receives resources before a transfer arrangement becomes 
binding, the resources are recognized as an asset when they meet the definition and satisfy 
the criteria for recognition as an asset and recognized as a liability until the event that 
makes the transfer arrangement binding occurs, and all other conditions under the 
agreement are fulfilled. When that event occurs and all other conditions under the 
agreement are fulfilled, the liability is discharged and revenue is recognized.”  

 
6. Further, Section 14, Chapter 7 of the same Manual on “Recognition of a Financial 
Liability” provides that “an entity shall recognize a financial liability in its statement of 
financial position when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.”  

 
7. The Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) for NGAs, as prescribed under GAM 
Volume III, describes the reported Liability specifically the account Other Unearned 
Revenue as the account used to recognize other income/revenue received in advance not 
falling under any of the specific unearned revenue accounts. Debit this account when 
revenue is earned. 
 
8. Executive Order No. 338, s. 1996 dated May 17, 1996 requires all government 
offices and agencies to immediately transfer all public monies deposited with depository 
banks and other institutions to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr), regardless of income 
source.  

 
9. We reviewed the Agency’s bank reconciliation statements (BRS) together with the 
bank statements and general ledger records of the Cash in Bank - Local Currency, Current 
Account and result of the verification revealed that there were no differences between 
monthly bank balances per bank statements and monthly general ledger book balances, 
except for the outstanding checks.  

 
10. However, we noted that various unidentified credit memos (CMs) from the monthly 
bank statements which were supposed to be reconciling items were instead recognized as 
debit Cash in Bank - LCCA and credit Other Unearned Revenue account even if its nature 
and purpose were not yet identified at the time of recording. Since the information were 
initially unavailable, all unidentified deposits were temporarily recorded in the Trust Fund 
(TF) books. Sample illustrative accounting entries made by the Accountant is shown in 
Table 2.

11. The practice required unnecessary transactions which made it circuitous, 
particularly for deposits/collections intended for the Regular Agency (RA) fund which 
were recorded interchangeably from TF to RA fund, and non-conformance to the 
abovementioned provisions on asset/liability recognition criteria by recording the 
unidentified deposits/collections despite unavailability of information and adequate proof 
to determine its true nature and purpose.      
 
12. As at December 31, 2020, the unidentified deposits/collections amounted to 
P938,486.79, the breakdown of which is as follows:   

 
Balance, January 1, 2020 869,858.43  
Less: Prior year (PY)'s identified 
deposits (772,534.32) 

Remaining balance from PY 97,324.11  
Add: Deposits in CY 2020 2,090,464.24  
Less: Identified deposits in CY 2020 (1,249,301.56) 
Balance, December 31, 2020 938,486.79  

 
13. Further analysis of the account disclosed that the recording of unidentified deposits 
started in March 2019. The Accountant informed us that the practice was made to comply 
with the CY 2018 audit observation on delayed recording of reconciling items due to the 
absence of a copy of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), hence, there was no 
immediate information relative to the credit memo or the fund transfer.  

 



37 
 

14. It bears noting though, that any adjustment made to record the reconciling item 
must be supported with the necessary supporting documents, if not, then these 
undetermined reconciling items, although recorded in the books, still affected the reliability 
of the Cash and Other Unearned Revenue accounts in the absence of appropriate 
documents and identification as to its nature and purpose. It was noted that only the 
monthly bank statements were used to support the initial recording of unidentified 
deposits/collection in the books.    

 
15. A well-prepared BRS is an adequate tool to monitor any irregularity or reconciling 
items instead of recording in the books without accurate basis. It is also more appropriate 
to improve the controls and coordination between the concerned offices in securing the 
MOA or information/documents relative to the unknown deposits/collections to prevent 
the accumulation and continued existence of reconciling items in the BRS, not to mention 
that the deposits in 2019 amounting to P97,324.11 remained undetermined for over a year 
already, which further delay would only increase the difficulty of its identification and 
settlement. 

 
16. The recording of deposits/collections/CMs in the books with a year-end balance of 
P938,486.79 without adequate supporting documents and proper establishment of its nature 
and purpose affected the reliability of the Cash in Bank - LCCA and Other Unearned 
Revenue accounts by P938,486.79. Continued failure to identify the nature and purpose of 
these deposits/collections, likewise, warrants the reversion of the amounts to the Bureau of 
the Treasury (BTr) pursuant to Executive Order No. 338, s. 1996.      

 

17. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 
 

a. Ensure that all cash transactions in the books are properly validated 
specific to its nature and purpose, and adequately supported with 

complete documents; 

 

b. Coordinate with the concerned office/s and install control measures on 
securing the MOA/documentations to immediately determine the nature 

of the CMs in the bank statements; and 

 

c. Exert effort to identify the nature of the amount P938,486.79 and 
immediately effect the necessary adjustment. Any undetermined balance 

should be dropped from the books and reported back in the BRS, or assess 

whether reversion to the Bureau of the Treasury is warranted.  
 
18. Management commented that under Section 4, Chapter 21 of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I "the monthly BRS shall be prepared by the Chief 
Accountant/designated staff for each of the bank accounts maintained by the agency/entity 
using the Adjusted Balance Method. Under this method, the book balance and the bank 
balance are brought to an adjusted cash balance that must appear on the Statement of 
Financial Position." Consequently, to account for the unknown deposits in the books, the 
Accountant used the Other Unearned Revenue account (a liability account) to temporarily 



38 
 

record it and prepare necessary adjusting entries when the documents/information are 
available. The Institute receives the asset and therefore, has an obligation to provide goods 
or services or to return the money. However, the Accountant inadvertently missed to 
disclose the undetermined deposits which were recognized in the books as Other Unearned 
Revenue in the Notes to Financial Statements.  

 
19. In addition, Section 11, Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I shows an illustrative 
accounting entry for adjustments in the Bank Reconciliation Statement for Authorized 
Government Depository Bank (AGDB) accounts, this includes the unrecorded deposits: 
 

 
 
20. Based on the foregoing bases, it is appropriate to have it recorded rather than not 
recording transactions, as recommended, until there is sufficient information available. 
Otherwise, it may result in inaccurate financial result due to a large amount of unreported 
transactions by the end of a reporting period. Moreover, Management will issue a 
memorandum to all the concerned personnel to inform and submit supporting documents 
to the Accounting Section of any payment transactions made by clients, which are directly 
deposited to the FNRI Project Account (1822-1032-40) for its proper classification and 
accounting in the books.  
 
21. The purpose of its recording in the book of accounts is to account/safeguard the 
asset despite the unavailable information and not provide inaccurate or misleading 
information.  

 
22. Section 3 - Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, states the objective of 
bank reconciliations preparation as follows: The Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) 
shall be prepared in order to: 
 

a. Check correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s/entity’s records, 
b. Serve as a deterrent to fraud, and 
c. Enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or credits recognized by the 

bank or agency/entity but not yet known to the agency/entity or bank. 
     

23. Nevertheless, a schedule of undetermined deposits is attached to the Monthly Bank 
Reconciliation Statement, for monitoring; and the Accountant is coordinating with the bank 
for the determination of the unknown deposits. 
 
24. The total amount of P821,940.68 was already identified and appropriately 
recognized in the book per JEV Nos. 2021-01-000218 dated January 27, 2021 and 2021-
03-000116 dated March 3, 2021. Further, a letter request has been sent to the Land Bank 
of the Philippines - Bicutan Branch for the remaining balance of ₱116,546.11 to request 



39 
 

information for its proper classification. Such amount shall be reverted immediately to the 
National Treasury if it is verified that it is an income for the General Fund. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

25. While we acknowledge the comments and actions taken by Management, we are of 
the opinion that it is still necessary that all cash transactions recorded in the books must be 
properly identified and supported with the necessary supporting documents to maintain the 
reliability of the accounts pursuant to Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 
that requires agencies to keep the accounts in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of 
the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or 
control agencies of the government; and that the highest standard of honesty, objectivity 
and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against 
inaccurate and misleading information 
 
26. We also advise Management to use the illustrative accounting entry under Section 
11, Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I relative to the unrecorded deposits provided again 
that these are found valid through a proper identification process. As a matter of 
comparison, it is quite inappropriate to recognize these unrecorded deposits merely on the 
basis of bank credits as it is to record an expense in the books or decrease in the cash 
balance with only the bank debits as our basis which is indeed detrimental for government 
funds. Moreover, the GAM for NGAs provides Accounting Policies, Guidelines and 
Procedures with Illustrative Accounting Entries, prescribed by the Commission on Audit 
for uniformity.  

 
Internal control lapses in handling collections 
 

27. Identified gaps noted in the collections and deposits process such as: (a) official 
receipts (ORs) were not issued and reported in strict numerical sequence per Report 

of Collections and Deposits (RCDs) as well as use of one series or booklet of ORs for 

all collections regardless of fund cluster; (b) inability to deposit intact all collections 

for the day; (c) non-use and/or non-preparation of prescribed forms/reports daily; 

and various errors in recording of transactions in the books of accounts, thus, 

resulting in the doubtful balance of the Cash-Collecting Officer account of P9,707.98. 
 
28. Paragraph 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards 1 (IPSAS 1) 
states that financial statements shall present fairly, among others, the financial position and 
financial performance of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of 
the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions 
and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs.  

 
29. As at December 31, 2020, the Cash-Collecting Officer account had a balance of 
P9,807.98, consisting of P9,707.98 for Regular Agency and P100.00 for Trust Fund. 
However, validation of the Report of Collections and Deposits (RCDs) disclosed that all 
collections were already deposited, except for the P100.00 under the Trust Fund, thus, 
affecting the reliability of the Cash-Collecting Officer account balance of P9,707.98.  



40 
 

30. Inquiry from the Accounting Unit disclosed that the amount was a carry-over 
balance from 2019 and prior years as a result of accumulated errors and adjustments in 
recording the collections and deposits as some transactions were interchangeably recorded 
in Regular Agency (RA) or Trust Fund (TF) account.  

 
31. The general ledger of Cash-Collecting Officer (RA books) vis-à-vis RCDs 
disclosed the following information:

Total 10,136,011.86  10,126,303.88  

End. Balance, Dec. 31, 2020  9,707.98   

 
32. Further scrutiny of accounting records and the RCDs revealed the following 
deficiencies that contributed to the misstatement and inaccuracy of recording the 
collections and deposits in the books.  
 

a) The ORs were not issued and reported in strict numerical sequence per RCD as 
only one series or booklet was being used for all collections regardless of fund 
cluster, thus, impeded ease and proper monitoring and reporting of collections and 
deposits.  

   
33. Section 39 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, on reporting 
of Collections and Deposits states that receipts and deposits shall be reported: 
 

“a.  At the close of the business day, the Collecting Officers shall prepare the 
Report of Collections and Deposits (RCD) (Appendix 26) for submission to 
Accounting Office/Unit. The report lists all the Official Receipts (ORs) 
issued in numerical sequence including cancelled ones.” (emphasis ours) 

 
34. Appendix 26 of the GAM, Volume II, requires that the Report of Collections and 
Deposits (RCDs) must be prepared by the Collecting Officer/Cashier to record his/her 
collections and deposits to an AGDB as of specific date and shall be maintained by fund 
cluster. 

 
35. The FNRI has various types of collections, including among others, income from 
laboratory services (analysis of samples), use of equipment and dormitory, sale of printing 
and publications, refund of unused cash advances, and receipt of funds from other agencies, 
which are either reported in the RA Fund or TF books. 

 



41 
 

36. The RCDs were aptly prepared per fund cluster starting August 2020. However, we 
observed that only one (1) series or booklet of ORs was being used for all types of 
collections regardless of fund cluster as it was already the practice prior to the GAM 
issuances. Thus, it seemed from the RCDs that the ORs were not issued in strict numerical 
sequence, contrary to Section 39 of the GAM, Volume I, which added difficulty in tracing 
the movement of ORs, nonetheless increases the probability of misuse/misapplication of 
collections later on.  

 
37. For instance, RCD No. 2020-08-097C reported issuance of OR Nos. 554394 and 
5545398 on August 18, 2020 and August 24, 2020, respectively. However, the ORs in 
between those series such as OR Nos. 5545395-554397 were separately recorded in two 
(2) other RCDs. Other similar instances are illustrated in the table below.

38. Oddly, we also noted that on February 18-19, 2020, OR No. 5545051 was issued 
in between OR Nos. 5545022 to 5554026 and OR Nos. 5545027 to 5545031 which was 
obviously out of the series.  

 
39. We noted that the Collecting Officer (CO) gathers all issued ORs, sorts the same 
according to fund and prepares the RCDs per fund. However, the same may be 
inconvenient especially to the Accounting Unit who receives and reviews the RCDs, as it 
requires more effort to verify the completeness of ORs since the series of issuances were 
most likely distributed based on the number of RCDs prepared per fund and per day not to 
mention that the RCDs were not consistently submitted to them on a daily basis. Certainly, 
this condition contributed in the error of interchangeably recording the transactions in 
RA/TF books.  

   
40. The use of one (1) series or booklet of ORs for all collections regardless of fund 
cluster and non-issuance/reporting of ORs in strict numerical sequence in the RCDs are not 
in consonance with Section 39 and Appendix 26 of the GAM, Volumes I and II, 
respectively, which impeded ease and proper monitoring and reporting of collections and 
deposits and also affected the accuracy in the recording of transactions in the respective 
books of accounts.  

 
b) The Collecting Officer was unable to deposit intact all collections for the day, 

maintain CRRec and prepare/submit the RCD daily, thus, resulting in under/over 
deposit and delayed deposits of collections, contrary to Section 69 of PD 1445 and 
Section 32 of the Revised Cash Examination Manual.   
 

41. Section 69 of PD 1445 provides that public officers authorized to receive and 
collect moneys arising from taxes, revenues or receipts of any kind shall remit or deposit 
intact the full amounts so received and collected by them to the treasury of the agency 
concerned and credited to the particular accounts to which the said moneys belong.  

 
42. Likewise, Section 32, Chapter II of the Revised Cash Examination Manual per 
COA Memorandum No. 2013-004 dated July 9, 2013 requires “all COs shall deposit intact 
all their collections, as well as collections turned over to them by sub-collectors/tellers, 
with authorized government depository bank (AGDB) daily or not later than the next 
banking day. Where collections are minimal and daily deposit thereof becomes costly and 
impractical, the COs shall deposit their collections at least once a week, or as soon as the 
collections reach P10,000.00. xxx” 

 
43. Section 40, Chapter 5 of the GAM for National Government Agencies (NGAs), 
Volume I provides that after receiving the payment from the payor and issuance of the OR 
to acknowledge receipt of cash/check, the CO shall record the collections in the Cash 
Receipts Record (CRRec). Moreover, Appendix 29 of the GAM, Volume II requires that 
each CO/Accountable Officer (AO) shall maintain this record (CRRec) to monitor his/her 
accountability. All transactions for the day shall be recorded immediately and a balance 
(Undeposited Collection) shall be extracted. 
 



43 
 

44. Post-audit of RCDs from January 1 to December 31, 2020, disclosed that certain 
collections were not deposited intact by the Collecting Officer that resulted in the 
under/over deposits of collections as well as delayed deposits ranging from five (5) to 52 
days. 
 
45. We noted that the CRRec was not maintained and the RCDs were not consistently 
prepared and submitted to the Accounting Unit on a daily basis but mostly weekly, with 
no immediate validation of the deposits against collections, and thus, the incidences of 
over/under deposits in a certain day, as shown in Table 5.

46. Further, due to the pandemic, it is quite understood that daily deposits were 
impractical at times or even impossible during lockdowns and bank closures. However, 
various transactions showed instances of partial deposits of collections where certain 
amounts of collections could had been deposited already but instead omitted or excluded 
at one point and deposited only at a later date.

47. It also bears stressing that such delays in the deposit of collections affect the manner 
of recording the transactions in the books. As collections were not deposited intact, it added 
difficulty on the part of the Accountant to identify and reconcile the deposited amount to 
the previous collections in the absence of such information in the submitted RCDs or list 
of deposited collections.   
 
48. Moreover, the practice of delaying the remittance of collections by the CO is not 
only in violation of the above-mentioned provisions but also increases the susceptibility of 
cash to misappropriation, which is prejudicial to the interest of the government.  
 
49. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

 

a. The Collecting Officer to: 
 

i. Use separate series or booklet of ORs for each fund/book (RA and TF) 
so that the issuance and reporting of ORs in the RCDs are consistently 

sequential to facilitate ease and proper monitoring of the issuances of 

ORs and recording of collections and deposits in the books;  

 

ii. Ensure that ORs are issued in strict numerical sequence for each 
fund/book; and 

 

iii. Deposit intact all collections of the day on the same day or the next 
banking day, prepare and submit the corresponding RCDs on a daily 



45 
 

basis to the Accountant, and maintain CRRec to monitor daily 

collections and deposits made; 

 

b. The Accountant to: 
 

iv. Review and verify records to determine the breakdown and 
particulars of the unadjusted balance of P9,707.98. Failure to identify 

the same may result in a refund in favor of the government as it is 

considered/reflected as undeposited collections in the books; and  

 

v. Be more prudent in recording the transactions and ensure that the 
same are properly reported in its respective books of accounts; and   

 

c. The Accountant and the Collecting Officer to conduct reconciliation of 
records regularly to immediately correct any discrepancy.  

 

50. Management informed that the unadjusted balance of ₱9,707.98 was already 
identified and recorded per JEV Nos. 2021-03-000717 to 718 dated March 29, 2021. 
 
51. In summary, the accounting deficiencies in Cash and Cash Equivalents and Deferred 
Credits/Unearned Income accounts amounting to P0.948 million which represents 0.21 percent 
of the total assets of the Institute as at December 31, 2020 is considered immaterial, thus, we 

rendered an Unqualified Opinion on the financial statements of the FNRI.  

 

Compliance Audit  
 

Unremitted excess proceeds from trainings conducted - P16,935.18 
 

52. Excess proceeds of P16,935.18 derived from the conduct of trainings were not 
remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) in violation of Section 12 of RA 11465, 

known as the General Appropriations Act of FY 2020.  
 

53. Section 12 of Republic Act (RA) No. 11465, or the General Appropriations Act 
(GAA) of Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, states that “Department, Bureaus, Offices and 
instrumentalities of the national government including Constitutional Offices, enjoying 
fiscal autonomy which conduct training programs in relation to their mandated functions 
are authorized to collect seminar, conference, training and oath taking fees from 
government and private agency participants. The proceeds derived from each seminar, 
conference, training and oath taking activities shall be deposited with the National 
Treasury as income of the General Fund pursuant to Section 44, Chapter 5, Book VI of 
E.O No. 292.  However, the agencies which do not have appropriations in their budgets 
for the purpose may use the proceeds for the conduct of the said seminar, conference, 
training and oath taking activities subject to budgeting, accounting and auditing rules and 
regulations.  Any excess proceeds shall be deposited with the National Treasury as 
income of the General Fund.” 



46 
 

54. As at December 31, 2020, the FNRI had already remitted excess proceeds derived 
from the conduct of trainings amounting to P175,670.38. Records, however, showed a 
remaining balance of P16,935.18 under Cash in Bank - LCCA that is still due for remittance 
to the BTr. The details of balance and transactions are presented in the table below.

55. As evidenced by the remittance to the BTr, it is ascertained that the trainings 
enumerated above have already been conducted/completed and related expenses incurred 
were likewise paid to the respective creditors. The remaining balances, except for the 
Training for the Conduct of Sensory Evaluation for the Sample Extruded Snack, were 
merely the result of some adjustments/errors made in the books which likewise warrants 
the reversion to the BTr. 

 
56. Delayed/non-remittance of the remaining excess/unexpended balances of the 
proceeds derived from the conduct of trainings due to errors in posting in the subsidiary 
ledgers increases the risks of possible misappropriation of funds and therefore, a loss of 
income in the General Fund as prescribed in Section 12 of RA 11465.  

 

57. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to be 
more prudent in recording transactions, remit to the BTr any excess proceeds derived 

from the conduct of trainings, and henceforth, strictly enforce the provisions of 

Section 12 of RA 11465.  
 

58. Management commented that the excess proceeds derived from the conduct of 
training amounting to ₱16,935.18 were remitted to the National Treasury per JEV-2021-
02-000373 and Check no. 516950 dated February 10, 2021. 

 

Unreverted Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable aged more than two (2) years - 
₱935,977.59 

 

59. The Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable account of P2.716 million included 
payables of P0.936 million or 34%, which remained outstanding/unclaimed for two 

(2) years or more, contrary to Section 1 of Executive Order No. 87 and Section 98 of 

Presidential Decree No. 1445. 



47 
 

60. Section 1 of Executive Order (EO) No. 87 dated August 13, 2019, states that “all 
documented accounts payable for the fiscal year 2016 and years prior thereto shall be 
reverted to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund, or the Cumulative 
Result of Operations of the National Government. Henceforth, all documented accounts 
payable which remain outstanding for at least two years, for which no actual 
administrative or judicial claim has been filed, shall be subject to automatic reversion.” 

 
61. Further, Section 5 of the same EO states that “the Order shall apply to all accounts 
payable of all National Government Agencies, except: (i) trust or fiduciary funds, for as 
long as the purposes for their creation have not been accomplished; and (ii) accounts 
payable corresponding to foreign-assisted projects for the duration of the said projects.” 

 
62. Moreover, Section 98 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that “the 
Commission upon notice to the head of agency concerned may revert to the unappropriated 
surplus of the general fund of the national government, any unliquidated balance of 
accounts payable in the books of the national government, which has been outstanding for 
two years or more and against which no actual claim, administrative or judicial, has been 
filed or which is not covered by perfected contracts on record. This section shall not apply 
to unliquidated balances of accounts payable in trust funds as long as the purposes for 
which the funds were created have not been accomplished.” 

 
63. As at December 31, 2020, the Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable account 
disclosed a balance of P2,716,493.82, which pertained to collections of performance bonds 
required by the agency from the suppliers/winning bidders as a guarantee to the faithful 
performance of its obligations under the contract. Aging of the account, however, revealed 
that 91 percent or P2,458,981.92 were already due and demandable, including the amount 
of P935,977.59 which remained unclaimed and outstanding for more than two (2) years 
even if the related procurement of goods/supplies and equipment were already delivered 
and accepted.

64. Taking into account of the previous year’s observation, it is worth noting that out 
of long outstanding payables in CY 2019 of P1,611,072.80, a total of P809,067.36 or 50.22 
percent were paid and/or reverted to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account in the 
current year. Further, the Accountant ensured that the remaining balances are strictly 
monitored and coordination with the suppliers are being made to settle their outstanding 



48 
 

accounts. The breakdown and status of the amount P935,977.59 which still remained 
outstanding for two (2) years or more are shown below.

65. It is emphasized that the delays on the part of the suppliers to claim their accounts 
have been long overdue, hence, continued waiting is no longer necessary. The continued 
existence of prior years’ payable accounts in the books unnecessarily immobilizes public 
funds, hampers efforts to determine the actual financial condition of the national 
government, and hinders effective resource planning and allocation, hence, the order for 
reversion of payables which remained outstanding for two (2) years or more pursuant to 
the above-cited provisions.  
 
66. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation and Management agreed to 
instruct the Accountant to continuously inform in writing the payee/supplier to claim 

their outstanding accounts; otherwise, make a necessary accounting entry to 

recognize the automatic reversion of payables which remain outstanding for two (2) 

years or more to the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit of the general fund. 
 

67. The Accountant already closed the long-outstanding Guaranty/Security Deposits 
Payable to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) as per the prior year’s audit recommendation 
amounting to ₱262,960.00, while there were suppliers who gave their confirmation to 
provide a request letter for its refund, thus, not reverted to the said account. Further, 
pending the release of guidelines and procedures relative to the reversion of accounts 
payable under EO 87, agencies have until the end of 2021 to comply under Section 4.1 of 
the Joint Circular dated March 08, 2021 posted by the DBM on their website on March 11, 
2021. Lastly, the implementation of the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) in Metro 
Manila and varying schedules due to the skeletal workforce arrangement hampered the 
communication with the suppliers and other activities.

Unreverted cancelled stale check for over two (2) years - P5,391.06   
 

68. Cancelled stale checks totaling P5,391.06 remained outstanding and carried 
over in books for over two (2) years and not yet reverted to the Accumulated Surplus 
contrary to Section 97 of PD 1445.    

 
69. Section 97 of PD 1445 on disposition of stale warrants or checks, states that: 

 
(1) A treasury warrant or check which remains outstanding after two (2) years from 
date of its issue shall not be paid by the Treasurer of the Philippines or by any duly 
authorized depository. The issuing agency shall take up in its books of accounts the 
amount of this warrant or check as surplus adjustment of the fund against which it 
was previously charged. Upon presentation of a stale warrant or check, the issuing 
agency shall cancel it and issue to the payee a substitute warrant or check in lieu 
thereof.  
 
(2) Such sum as may be necessary to meet the obligation arising out of the issuance 
of substitute warrants or checks chargeable against the general fund shall be charged 
to the current year’s General Appropriations law, subject to pertinent budget rules 
and regulations. Substitute warrants or checks payable from funds other than the 
general fund shall be paid from the appropriate funds. 
 

70. Review of various subsidiary ledger (SL) balances under the Cash in Bank - LCCA 
account pertained to cancelled stale checks which remained outstanding for 10 months to 
over two (2) years, and continuously carried over in the books as they were unclaimed by 
the suppliers and with minimal effort by the Management to enforce its settlement.

71.   Given that these are valid obligations, it is imperative for the Institute to monitor 
and ensure its payment to its creditors. The settlement of these amounts would likewise 
facilitate the process of clearing the balances in the books of accounts, instead of leaving 
these dormant for months or even years. Nevertheless, the amount of P5,391.06 which 
remained outstanding for more than two (2) years must be reverted to the Accumulated 
Surplus pursuant to Section 97 of PD 1445.   



50 
 

72. The continuous non-settlement of liabilities resulted in existence of cancelled stale 
checks for over two (2) years, contrary to Section 97 of PD 1445.  

 

73. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 
 

a. Verify the status and validity of the cancelled stale checks and coordinate 
with creditors to facilitate settlement of the balance; otherwise, directly 

remit to the BTr as deemed necessary; and 

 

b. Transfer/revert to the Accumulated Surplus the amounts of issued checks 
that remained outstanding for more than two (2) years as provided for in 

Section 97 of PD 1445. 

 
74. Management commented that Section 97 of PD 1445 provides that upon 
presentation of a stale warrant or check, the issuing agency shall cancel it and issue the 
payee a substitute warrant or check in lieu thereof. Therefore, the Accountant shall prepare 
a list of stale checks for endorsement to the Collecting and Disbursing Section to prepare 
replacement checks for the settlement of the outstanding payables. 
 

Other Compliance Issues 
 

Gender and Development (GAD) 
  
75. The CY 2020 Programs/Projects addressing the GAD Plan of the Institute 
complied with the requirements of Section 31 of the General Provisions of the General 

Appropriations Act (GAA) of FY 2020, representing actual utilization of P227.835 

million or 81.48 percent of its original budget of P279.619 million, or an equivalent of 

50.52 percent of its appropriations of P553.507 million. 

  

76. Section 31 of the GAA for FY 2020 provides, among others, “All agencies of the 
government shall formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address 
gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate xxx.”  
 
77. “The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which 
shall be at least 5% of their Budgets. xxx. Utilization of the GAD budget shall be evaluated 
based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.”  

 
78. Based on the Institute’s report of accomplishment, particularly on GAD as at 
December 31, 2020, Management had allotted ₱279,618,962.00 or an equivalent of 50.52 
percent of its current year appropriations of ₱553,507,000.00 and had an actual utilization 
of ₱227,834,818.88, having implemented four (4) client-focused activities and three (3) 
out of seven (7) organization-focused activities, the details of which are presented in Table 
11 below. As noted, some of the GAD activities were suspended during the COVID-19 
pandemic.

79. We recommended and Management agreed to continue integrating GAD-
related activities into the Institute’s regular programs and projects, and exert effort 

to strictly implement its GAD focused programs as planned. 

 

Projects Related to Senior Citizens, Differently-Abled Persons and the Youth 
 

80. The Institute was able to incorporate and implement programs/activities/ 
projects which are related to Senior Citizens, Differently-Abled Persons and the 

Youth in compliance with Sections 32 and 33 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 

GAA. 

 

81. Section 32 of the GAA for FY 2020 provides, “All agencies of the government shall 
formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens 
and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate 
the same in their regular activities.” 

 
82. “Moreover, all government infrastructure and facilities, shall provide architectural 
or structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety 
and welfare of persons with disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA 7277.”      

 
83. Further, Section 33 of the GAA for FY 2020 states that “all agencies of the 
government are encouraged to provide allocation for youth development projects and 
activities within the framework of the Philippine Youth Development Plan (PYDP) 2017-
2022.” 

 
84. Pursuant to Sections 32 and 33 of the GAA, the Institute incorporated in its regular 
operation programs/activities/projects which address the concerns of Senior Citizens, 
persons with disability and the youth. The details are presented in Table 12 below.

85. However, the FNRI buildings, facilities and laboratories, except for the entrance 
lobby which has a provision for the ramp, are not yet compliant with the requirements of 
Section 32 of the GAA insofar as the facilities should reasonably enhance the mobility, 
safety and welfare of persons with disability such as, but not limited to, the provision of 
elevators and handles to ensure their safety and well-being. However, renovation of 
buildings or provision of elevators may not be implemented due to the recommended 
relocation of the office building, as the current location of the office building is parallel to 
a fault line.  
 
86. We recommended and Management agreed to continue to integrate more 
programs and projects into its regular activities that will address the concerns of 

senior citizens, PWDs and youth in line with its mandates, and exert more effort to 

comply with the provision of facilities for senior citizens and PWDs, both for the 

current and relocated/new office buildings.  

 
Monitoring of Compliance with other Mandatory Accounts 

 

87. Analysis of the accounts Due to BIR, GSIS, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG showed that 
for CY 2020, the Agency has deducted from the salaries of its personnel the required tax, 
premiums and loan installments, and remitted the same together with the government share 
within the prescribed period to the concerned institutions or agencies.  Details are in Table
