Dear Secretary Lopez: 
 

Consolidated Management Letter on the Audit of the 

Department of Trade and Industry – Office of the Secretary 

for the period January 1 to December 31, 2020 

 

I. INTRODUCTION 

 

1. Pursuant to Section 2, Article IX-D of the Constitution of the Philippines and Section 
43 of the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines or Presidential Decree (PD) 
No. 1445, we have conducted the financial audit with compliance to other legal and 
regulatory requirements on the accounts and transactions of the Department of 
Trade and Industry-Central Office (DTI-CO) and 15 Regional Offices (ROs)  

for the period ended December 31, 2020. However, the complete results of the 
financial audit cannot be incorporated in this report in view of the non-submission of 
the complete Combined Financial Statements for CY 2020 and its integral parts 
where an opinion could be rendered.  The audit was conducted in accordance with 
the International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs).  Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain a reasonable basis for our 
conclusions. 

 
2. The audit was conducted by the audit team led by Ms. Consorcia B. Ponte, State 

Auditor IV, Audit Team Leader, and Ms. Aurora R. Caramat, State Auditor IV, OIC, 
Supervising Auditor to:  (a) evaluate the extent of compliance with laws, rules and 
regulations as well as propriety and validity of transactions; (b) recommend measures 
to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency’s operations; and (c) 
determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations. 

 
3. Deficiencies observed in the course of the audit were earlier communicated to 

management through Audit Observation Memoranda (AOMs). Their comments on 
their AOMs were incorporated in this letter, where appropriate.

Audit Report in view of the non-preparation and submission of the required complete 
set of CY 2020 Financial Statements (FSs), in accordance with the International 
Public Sector Accounting Standards, for more than 30 days after the prescribed due 
date of February 14, 2020.

the ₱299.055 million which was withdrawn in compliance with Paragraph V of RA 
11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act. 

 
Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 

 

13. Twelve ROs have no fund transfers to Procurement Service-Department of Budget 
and Management (PS-DBM) and Philippine International Trade Center (PITC) for 
its common office supplies and equipment requirement during the year, and no 
unliquidated fund transfers in prior years. In ROs III and V, fund transfers to PS-
DBM for its common use office supplies and equipment requirement during the year 
amounting to ₱0.175 million and ₱0.357 million, respectively, were granted and 
liquidated in accordance with COA Circular No. 94-013.  In DTI-CO, fund transfers 
to PS-DBM during the year amounted to ₱14.010 million, and ₱8.726 million were 
liquidated, leaving an unliquidated balance of ₱5.284 million.  Moreover, in DTI-CO 
and RO VI,  there were still unliquidated fund transfers to PS-DBM and PITC in 
prior years amounting to ₱45.799 million or 42.37 percent of prior years’ balance of 
₱108.093 million. (Paragraph No. 76) 

 
14. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the:  

 
a) DTI-CO, to instruct the Accountant and Property Officer  to coordinate with the 

PS-DBM to facilitate the deliveries of the items procured in 2019 and/or refund 
the cost of undelivered or request for the replacement of undelivered items 
through the preparation of the new Agency Procurement Requests (APRs); and 
Finance Service to remind PITC not only to refund unutilized fund of ₱3.702 
million but to pay any interest earned that has accrued to the unutilized fund, 
pursuant to the provisions in the MOA. 

 



5 | P a g e  

 

b) RO VI, to make constant follow-up with the PS-DBM to facilitate the delivery 
of the items requested, or refund the cost of the undelivered items, if these can 
no longer be delivered. 

 
15. Six ROs have no dormant receivables, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers 

for write-off. In DTI-CO, ROs I, II, III, V, IX, X and XII, dormant receivable 
accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers amounting to ₱110.749 
million were not requested for write-off or requests were made but were returned due 
to insufficiency of documents. In CAR, request for write-off was submitted, but still 
for review by the Audit Team. (Paragraph 90) 
 

16. We recommended and Management agreed to require the: (i) Accountants of ROs I, 
II, V, IX, X, to request for authority to write-off the dormant receivables in 
accordance with the guidelines and procedures embodied in COA Circular  No. 2016-
005; (ii) Accountants of DTI-CO, ROs XII and III, to exert extra effort to submit the 
required/alternative documents and/or proof of actions undertaken for the recovery 
of such dormant accounts but to no avail, to support the request for write–off. 
 

17. Two ROs submitted copies of government contracts and their supporting documents 
to the COA within the prescribed period in accordance with Items 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of 
COA Circular No. 2009-001.  However, in the DTI-CO and six ROs, contracts and 
POs totaling 2,542 with corresponding amount of ₱740.076 million were not 
submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from one to 363 days as 
of year-end. Moreover, in RO XIII, 149 POs amounting to ₱2.831 million were not 
properly accomplished. Furthermore, in RO V, 32 contracts in the total amount of 
₱41.677 million submitted for review were not supported with complete 
documentation.  (Paragraph 120) 

 
18. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the concerned officers of the 

Procurement Division of: 
 

a) DTI-CO and ROs I, II, V, IX, XIII and CAR to designate a Procurement 
Personnel to take charge in the submission of the copies of contracts, POs and 
work orders, together with the required supporting documents to COA within 
five days upon perfection/issuance thereof; 
 

b)  RO XIII to properly accomplish the POs in accordance with Appendix 61, 
Volume II of the GAM for NGAs; and 
 

c) RO V to submit the lacking supporting documents for submitted contracts. 
 
Enforcement of Settlement of Accounts 

 

19. Notice of Suspensions (NSs) and Notice of Disallowances (NDs) issued for 
transactions post-audited during the year amounted to ₱18.869 million due to non-



6 | P a g e  

 

compliance with various laws, rules, and regulations. Moreover, only the amount of 
₱18.378 million was settled with corresponding Notice of Settlement of Suspension, 
Disallowances and Charges (NSSDCs) issued during the year, leaving unsettled 
suspensions, disallowances and charges amounting to ₱46.048 million as of the end 
of the year. (Paragraph No. 178) 
 

COVID-19 related expenses 

 

20. Of the total allotments of ₱344.948 million allotted for COVID-19 initiatives, only 
the amount of ₱310.044 million was utilized/obligated in accordance with the 
purpose of appropriation/allotment. Likewise, total disbursements of ₱247.692 
million was only 79.89 percent of the total obligations. The low fund utilization and 
disbursement rates were due to low fund utilization and disbursement rates of 74.78 
percent and 22.85 percent, respectively, of the funds for the BP-SSF Project under 
Bayanihan Act Two which was released only in the fourth quarter of CY 2020, after 
the enactment of RA No. 11494, otherwise known as the “Bayanihan to Recover as 
One Act” on September 11, 2020. (Paragraph 186) 

 

21. The DTI-CO and ROs reported that it had distributed livelihood kits with a total 
equivalent amount of ₱141.835 million. However, only ROs CAR, II, III, VII, X and 
XII complied with the authorized range of assistance of ₱5,000.00 but not more than 
₱8,000.00 amounting to ₱53.328 million in the form of livelihood kits, and the 
submission of documentary requirements to support its distribution. Moreover, the 
DTI-CO and other ROs reported several deficiencies, such as; (a) financial benefits 
are below or in excess of the authorized ceiling of ₱5,000.00 to ₱8,000.00; and (b) 
inadequacy of documents to support the validity of distribution of financial benefits.  
(Paragraph 196) 

 
22. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the heads of:  

 
a) DTI-CO, ROs V and XI to observe strictly the range of financial benefits to Five 

Thousand Pesos, but not more than Eight Thousand Pesos (₱5,000.00 – 
₱8,000.00) authorized under DTI DO No. 54.  Excess cost of financial benefits 
granted will be disallowed in audit and shall be the sole responsibility of the 
officers authorizing it. A separate ND will be issued for the excess cost over the 
authorized budget ceiling; and  

 
b) ROs I, IV-A, IV-B, VI, IX and XIII to submit the distribution list, supported 

with the duly signed acknowledgement receipts, pledged of commitments and 
masterlist of approved beneficiaries to validate the actual distribution of the 
livelihood kits and ensure that intended benefits had redound to the authorized 
beneficiaries. Failure to submit the requested documents will constrain the 
auditors concerned to issue the Notice of Suspensions.

Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 

 

23. Of the 37 prior year’s audit recommendations, 13 were implemented and 24 were not 
implemented of which 19 were reiterated in this report. 

 

 
III. OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
A. Financial Audit 

 

Non-submission of Consolidated Financial Statements 

24. The DTI failed to submit the Supporting Schedules, and Financial Statements 
(FSs) with the corresponding Notes to FS for the Year Ended December 31, 

2020, as required under Sections 41 and 122 of PD No. 1445 and Section 60, 

Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus, prevented the Auditor to express 

an audit opinion on the consolidated FSs of the Agency. Likewise, the objectives 

of general-purpose financial reporting in the public sector, which is to provide 

information useful for decision making was not achieved. 

 
25. Section 41 (2) and (3) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides, thus: 
 

(2) To carry out the purposes of this section, the chief accountant or the 
official in charge of keeping the accounts of a government agency shall 
submit to the Commission year-end trial balances and such other supporting 
or subsidiary statements as may be required by the Commission not later 
than the fourteenth day of February. Trial balances returned by the 
Commission for revision due to non-compliance with accounting rules and 
regulations, shall be resubmitted within three days after the date of receipt 
by the official concerned. 

 
(3) Failure on the part of any official or employee to comply with the 
provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph shall cause the 
automatic suspension of the payment of his salary and other emoluments 
until he shall have complied there with. The violation of these provisions for 
at least three times shall subject the offender to administrative disciplinary 
action. 

 
26. Also, Section 122 of PD No. 1445 states that: 
 

Submission of reports. Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the 
service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it require the 
agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing 
officers, administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials 
of the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, 



8 | P a g e  

 

current plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary 
for the exercise of its functions. 

 
(2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents 
and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of 
payment of their salaries until they shall have complied with the 
requirements of the Commission. 

 
27. Pertinent provisions under Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual 

(GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I provide the 
following: 

 
Section 3. Purpose of Financial Statements. It states that: 

 
a.  “Financial statements are a structured representation of the financial 

position and financial performance of an entity. The objectives of 
general-purpose financial statements are to provide information about 
the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity 
that is useful to a wide-range of users in making and evaluating decisions 
about the allocation of resources. Specifically, the objectives of general-
purpose financial reporting in the public sector should be to provide 
information useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the 
accountability of the entity for the resources entrusted to it, xx” 

 
Section 5. Components of Financial Statements. It states that: 

 
“A complete set of financial statements (condensed and by fund cluster) to 
be submitted by an entity shall include the following: 

 
a. Statement of Financial Position (SFP) (Annex A); 
b. Statement of Financial Performance (SFPer) (Annex B); 
c. Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity (SCNA/E) (Annex C); 
d. Statement of Cash Flows (SCF) (Annex D); 
e. Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amount (SCBAA) 

(Annex E); and 
f. Notes (Annex F), comprising a summary of significant accounting 

policies and other explanatory notes. (Par. 21, IPSAS 1).” 
 

Section 60 sets the deadlines on submission of these financial statements. It 
provides that “All NGAs shall prepare and submit the following financial 
statements and schedules xxx, within the prescribed deadline.” 

 
 
 



9 | P a g e  

 

Particularly, quoted below is the responsibility and deadline pertaining to 
the year-end reports: 

 
Entity/Office Statement/Report Deadline Submit to: 

Regional/ Year-end TBs, FSs, On or before Regional Auditor, 
Branches SSs (Combined RO January 31 Central Office 
Offices and OUs) of the 

following year 
 

Chief Accountant 
 

Central/Head/ Year-end TBs, FSs, February 14  COA Auditor, DBM, 
Main Offices SSs (Combined CO, of the  COA-GAS 
Entity Office ROs and OUs) following year  

 
28. To date, while the combined Trial Balances (TBs), financial statements (FSs) of the 

CO and its ROs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were submitted to the COA, 
the Supporting Schedules (SSs) and the Notes to Financial Statements which form 
part of the FSs were not submitted, contrary to Section 60, Chapter 19 of the GAM 
for NGAs, Volume I. 
 

29. Thus, audit opinion cannot be rendered by the Auditor on the Combined FSs as of 
December 31, 2020.  Also, the Agency’s financial condition, results of operations for 
CY 2020 could not be presented. 

 
30. Likewise, the objectives of general-purpose financial reporting in the public sector, 

which is to provide information useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the 
accountability of the entity for the resources entrusted to it, were not achieved since 
the financial statements were not provided in a timely manner as needed in decision 
making. Therefore, the delayed preparation of the FSs by DTI deprived the intended 
users for its use in decision making. 
 

31. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountant to 
strictly comply with the submission of Consolidated Trial Balances with 

Supporting Schedules, and Financial Statements with the corresponding Notes 

to FS to the Office of the Auditor, in accordance with the timelines provided for 

in the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume I. 
 

32. Also, institute administrative sanctions to the Chief Accountant and all other 
concerned personnel of the Finance Service for their failure to submit the 

Consolidated Financial Statements and its integral parts to the auditor 

concerned for audit, taking into consideration that this problem had been in 

existence for quite a long time even before the pandemic, in pursuant to Sections 

41 and 122 of PD No. 1445.

B. Compliance with Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Audit 
 

Fund Utilization/obligation 
 

33. Overall, the agency’s fund utilization/obligation of ₱5,397.311 million is  91.71 
percent, compared to its total adjusted  allotments of ₱5,884.922 million, net of 

₱299.055  million which was realigned in compliance with paragraph V of RA 

11469, otherwise known as the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, thus, leaving a 

balance of ₱487.611 million due to procurement activities that were not pursued 

brought about by the imposed restrictions/limitations due to the COVID-19 

pandemic and the late releases of funds for the Balik Probinsya, Bagong Pag-

Asa Program under RA 11494.  Also, it registered a utilization rate of 91.35 

percent for the Exports and Investments Development Program, which were in 

accordance with the purpose of appropriation/allotment.  

 

34. To facilitate various government agencies’ fulfillment of their mandate, the National 
Budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 was approved through Republic Act (RA) No. 
11465, also known as the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020, which 
states in its General Provisions that: 
 

Sec. 60. Cash Budgeting System. All appropriations authorized in this 
Act... shall be available for release and disbursement for the purpose 
specified, and under the same general and special provisions applicable 
thereto, until December 31, 2020. 
 

35. Also, National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated January 6, 2020, or the 
guidelines on the release of funds for FY 2020, Item 3.5 provides that: 
 

“Pursuant to RA 11464, an Act Extending the Availability of the FY 2019 
Appropriations to December 31, 2020, amending for the Purpose Section 
65 of the General Provisions of R.A. No. 11260, the General Appropriations 
Act of Fiscal Year 2019, the guidelines prescribed under Items 3.4.1 and 
3.4.2 hereof shall apply.” 

 
36. Item 3.4.1 of the same NBC states that: 
 

“The appropriations for the following items under the FY 2020 GAA shall 
be valid for obligation until December 31, 2020: 

3.4.1.1 Infrastructure Capital Outlays (CO), including subsidy releases to 
GOCCs for infrastructure projects; 

3.4.1.2 MOOE and other CO items.” 
 
37. The Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and 

Balances (SAAODB) or Financial Accountability Report (FAR) No. 1 for Calendar

Year (CY) 2020 showed that, out of the total adjusted available allotment of 
₱5,884.922 million, ₱5,397.311 million or 91.71 percent were utilized/obligated, 
leaving an unutilized allotment of ₱487.611 million, shown as follows:

Total       1,050.938         960.064 90.874 91.35 

 
38. The 91.71 percent fund utilization rate was attributed to low utilization of the 

allotments released under the Special Fund for the Balik Probinsya, Bagong Pag-asa 
Project, intended for the procurement of machinery and equipment for the SSF 
Project under the Balik Probinsya Program (BPP) as one of the government’s 
response to combat the COVID-19 pandemic under RA 11494 otherwise known as 
the  Bayanihan to Recover as One Act, which was enacted only on September 11, 
2020, hence, the late releases of funds. Likewise, Republic Act No. 11519, an Act 
Extending the Availability of Appropriations under Republic Act No. 11494, 
provides that the appropriations shall be available for release, obligation, and 
disbursement until June 30, 2021, hence, we find the non-full utilization of the 
allotments justifiable. 
 



12 | P a g e  

 

39. On the other hand, the 91.35 percent fund utilization for the EIDP was attributed to 
the delayed deliveries of goods and services and procurement activities not pursued 
in CY 2020 brought about by the imposed restrictions/limitations due to COVID-19 
pandemic, which was beyond the control of management. 

 
Cash Utilization/ Disbursements  
 
40. Of the total cash allocation of ₱5,979.500 million  received during the year, 98.39 

percent  or  ₱5,883.274 million was utilized/disbursed inclusive of the payment of 
accounts payable, leaving a balance of ₱96.226 million that was reverted to the 
Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) due to delayed deliveries of goods and services and 
procurement activities not pursued in CY 2020 brought about by the imposed 
restrictions/limitations due to COVID-19 pandemic, which was beyond the control 
of management. Also, disbursements amounting to ₱844.857 million for the EIDP 
were regular, necessary, and not excessive, extravagant, and unconscionable. 

 
Reversion of dormant cash, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary funds 

41. DTI-CO and 13 ROs have no dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, 
unnecessary special and trust funds, and related accounts for reversion as of 

year-end, in conformity with Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012, 

dated September 11, 2012, implementing Executive Order No. 431, dated May 

30, 2005.  However, in ROs III and IX, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary 

special and trust funds as of year-end, including fees, charges, assessments, and 

other receipts or revenues collected, trust receipts and performance bonds 

during the year, except as authorized by law to be retained by the agency for its 

use, amounting to ₱10.884 million, were not reverted/deposited to the National 

Treasury.  

 
42. Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012, 

promulgated the rules and regulations in implementing Executive Order No. 431 
dated May 30, 2005 for the reversion of all dormant accounts, unnecessary special 
and trust funds to the account of the National Treasury.  

 
43. Section 3.3 of this DBM-DOF-COA Joint Circular defined unauthorized accounts as 

those cash accounts balances maintained by agencies without authority or legal basis; 
or cash account balances with a specific authority but maintained with non-AGDBs. 
 

44. DTI-CO and 13 ROs have no dormant, unnecessary special and trust funds; however, 
in ROs III and IX, unauthorized trust accounts, unnecessary funds, and trust receipts 
amounting to ₱10.884 million were not reverted/deposited to the National Treasury, 
contrary to the aforementioned Joint Circular, as shown in the next page.

45. The unused funds of the POs of RO III were brought about by the excessive fund 

transfer resulting in the unutilized cash at year end which should have been reverted 
to the National Treasury, to maximize its utilization and to help minimize 
government borrowings and rationalize cash management.  
 

46. In RO IX, the aforementioned accounts were opened to facilitate transfer of funds 
from the RO to POs for their operating expenses due to the difficulty of processing 
all claims in the RO. The agency failed to close these accounts and to secure an 
authority from the BTr to open another set of accounts. 
 

47. The holding of funds in the bank for an indefinite period and with no specific 
purpose, is contrary to sound cash management systems, thus depriving the 
government from using the much-needed funds for its operations. 
 

48. Management in RO III explained that these are inclusive of funds of continuing 
projects. As for the remaining cash funds for the MOOEs of the POs, they have 
agreed that these, if any, shall be reverted to the National Treasury. 
 

49. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Regional Directors of 
ROs III and IX to:  

 

a) revert/remit their balances of ₱9.175 million and ₱1.709 million, 
respectively, to the National Treasury; 

 

b) avoid the accumulation of unutilized funds at year end by limiting fund 
transfer to POs for two-month operational requirements; and 

 



14 | P a g e  

 

c) request authority from the BTr for the trust funds opened by POs for their 
operating expenses and close all existing trust accounts unless authorized 

by law to be retained by the agency for its use. 

 

Non-liquidation of Cash Advances 
 

50. Cash advances granted during the year for operating expenses, official local and 
foreign travels, and special purpose/time-bound undertakings in ROs CAR, I, 

IV-A, V and VI amounting to ₱25.757 million were liquidated in accordance 

with Section 89 of PD 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 

1997.   While in DTI CO, ROs II and IX, the amount of ₱47.392 million or 45.00 

percent of the cash advances granted during the year amounting to ₱105.313 

million were not liquidated at the end of the year. Also, there were still 

unliquidated cash advances in prior years amounting to ₱11.119 million or 17.54 

percent of prior years’ balance of ₱63.398 million.   

 
51. Section 89 of PD No. 1445 requires that “xxx. A cash advance shall be reported on 

and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served.  No 
additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the 
previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is 
made.” 
 

52. Section 5.8 of COA Circular 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, provides that “All cash 
advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year. Except for Petty Cash 
Fund, the Accountable Officer (AO) shall refund any unexpended balance to the 
cashier who will issue the necessary official receipt.” 
 

53. Section 4.4.2 of the same circular prescribes the limit of cash advances to be granted 
and the period within which the cash advance for field operating expenses is to be 
liquidated.  The regulation states that “The amount of the cash advance shall be 
limited to the requirements for two months.  Within 5 days after the end of each 
month, the AO shall submit a Report of Disbursements.” 
 

54. Further, Section 4.1.7 states that “The cash advance shall be used solely for the 
specific legal purpose to which it was granted. Under no circumstance shall it be 
used for encashment of checks or for liquidation of a previous cash advance.” 
 

55. Cash advances granted during the year for operating expenses, official local and 
foreign travels, and special purpose/time-bound undertakings in five ROs amounting 
to ₱25.757 million were liquidated in accordance with COA Circular No. 97-002 
dated February 10, 1997, shown in the next page.

57. The amount for operating expenses of the DTI-CO pertains to cash advances granted 

to foreign trade service officers (FTSOs) posted abroad for the operational 
requirements of the Philippine Trade and Investment Centers (PTICs). For CY 2020, 
out of the cash advances granted to PTICs amounting to ₱43.147 million, ₱29.959 
million or 69.43 percent was liquidated during the year. The significant balance of 
cash advances was due to the adoption of the Imprest System where the FTSOs were 
granted initial cash advances equivalent to two months operating expenses at the 
beginning of the year subject to replenishment on a monthly basis or at any time the 
post has incurred at least 50% of their cash advances through the submission of 



16 | P a g e  

 

complete supporting documents. Upon replenishment, the appropriate expense is 
debited and Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account (CIB-LCCA) equivalent 
to the amount of disbursement is credited, hence, the initial cash advance remains in 
the books of accounts. 
 

58. The non-submission or reporting of the FTSOs of their unreplenished expenses at 
year-end contributed to the significant balance of the cash advances. 
 

59. In  RO IX, funds transferred to POs for their operating activities amounted to ₱44.705 
million, of which ₱10.955 million or 24.51 percent were liquidated, leaving a balance 
of ₱33.750 million as of year-end.  Considering that the cash advances were granted 
to cover the operating expenses of POs, these could have been liquidated as of 
December 31, 2020.  Review of current year transactions showed that there were still 
advances which were not liquidated in full as required under Section 5.8 of COA 
Circular No. 97-002.  
 

60. Also, audit disclosed abnormal/negative balances amounting to ₱0.345 million due 
to submission of liquidations more than the amount of advances which was due to 
lack of records maintained by the POs in the monitoring of disbursements for a 
particular fund transfer. 

 
61. Cash advances granted during the year for official local and foreign travels in the 

DTI-CO and RO II amounted to ₱9.779 million, of which ₱9.773 million were 
liquidated leaving a balance of ₱0.006 million.  However, cash advances granted in 
prior years in RO II remained unliquidated and outstanding for more than ten years. 
 

62. The balance of prior years’ unliquidated cash advances of ₱11.119 million pertains 
to accounts of FTSOs who are no longer connected with DTI or already separated 
from the service but did not secure clearances from their accountabilities.  Demand 
letters have been sent to the accountable officers of DTI-CO but were returned to 
sender (RTS) due to inexistent addresses or addressees already moved out.   
 

63. Cash advances were liquidated at the rate of 55.00 percent for current year and 82.46 
percent for prior years.  Compared to last year, liquidation rate decreased by 5.00 
percent for current year cash advances while prior year’s liquidation rate increased 
by 21.00 percent.  The increase in prior years’ liquidation rate is attributable to the 
sending of demand letters to concerned accountable officers.  
 

64. As shown in the preceding table, cash advances were not liquidated fully at the end 
of each year, hence, the accumulation of unliquidated cash advances is not in 
accordance with the afore-cited regulations. 

 
65. In ROs III, IV-B, VII, VIII, X, XI, XII and XIII, no data were provided on how much 

cash advances were granted and liquidated for current and prior years. 
 



17 | P a g e  

 

66. The non-liquidation of the cash advances exposed the funds to possible loss, misuse, 
or misapplication and resulted in the misstatement of related expenses at the time 
these were actually incurred and overstatement of the advances accounts. 

 
67. We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 
 

 FTSOs - 

 

a. to (i) submit the list of unreplenished disbursements pertaining to CY 2020 
to fully account for the actual undisbursed balance out of the cash advances; 

and (ii) direct them to submit their liquidation reports pertaining to the 

prior years’ unliquidated balances;  

 

POs of RO IX - 

 

b. to liquidate their advances in full and for Accounting Unit to monitor 
liquidation and continue sending demand letters;  

 

c. to require their AOs concerned to analyze abnormal balances and submit 
to the Regional Accountant details of their liquidation for adjustment.  

  

Non-liquidation of fund transfers to implementing agencies and NGOs/POs 
 

68. In RO III, fund transfer to Non-Government Organizations/People’s 
Organizations (NGOs/POs) during the year for the implementation of agency 

projects amounting to ₱0.028 million or 100 percent of the funds transferred 

was liquidated in accordance with COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 

13, 1994, and Section 5.4 of COA Circular No. 2017-001 dated October 25, 2007.  

However, in DTI-CO and seven ROs, there were still unliquidated fund 

transfers to NGAs, LGUs, GOCCs and NGOs/POs in prior years, amounting to 

₱837.047 million or 95.23 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱878.936 million. 
 

69. COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994, sets out the rules and 
regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred from the 
Source Agency (SA) to the Implementing Agency (IA). The SA shall require the 
submission by the IA of the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of 
Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds within ten (10) days after 
the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, and the return to the 
SA of any unused balance upon completion of the project.  

 
70. Section 5.4 of COA Circular No. 2017-001 dated October 25, 2007, states that 

“Within sixty (60) days after the completion of the project, the NGO/PO shall submit 
the final Fund Utilization Report certified by its Accountant and approved by its 
President/Chairman to the GO, together with the inspection report and certificate of 
project completion rendered/issued by the GO authorized representative, list of 



18 | P a g e  

 

beneficiaries with their acceptance/acknowledgement of the 
project/funds/goods/services received. xxx These documents shall support the 
liquidation of funds granted to the NGO/PO.” 

 
71. In RO III, fund transfer to NGOs/POs during the year of ₱0.028 million was 100 

percent liquidated.  However, in DTI-CO and ROs II, III, V, VI, IX, XII and XIII, of 
the fund transfers to NGAs, LGUs, GOCCs and NGOs/POs in prior years amounting 
to ₱878.936 million, ₱837.047 million or 95.23 percent was not liquidated, contrary 
to the aforementioned circulars. Details are presented below:

 Excludes fund transfers to PS-DBM and PITC 
 
72. Funds transferred to NGOs/POs during the year were released in RO III to implement 

a market research and design workshop project.  Prior years fund transfers to NGAs, 



19 | P a g e  

 

GOCCs, LGUs and NGOs/POs were released to implement projects like the Bottom 
Up Budgeting/Grassroots Participatory Program (BuB/GPB), Rural Micro Enterprise 
Promotion Programme (RuMEPP), Small and Medium Enterprises Development 
Fund and CARP Fund 158, Integrated Natural Resources and Environmental 
Management Project (INREMP), Personal Computer for Public Schools (PCPS) 
Project and Rural Agro-Industrial Partnership for Inclusive Development (RAPID) 
Growth Project.  
 

73. Current year fund transfers registered a 100 percent liquidation while prior years had 
4.79 percent only.  Last year, current year fund transfers had a liquidation rate of 5.00 
percent while prior years had 44.60 percent.  
 

74. The failure to liquidate the transfers was due to the difficulty in locating the 
whereabouts of the persons in charge in the concerned NGAs, GOCCs, LGUs, and 
NGOs/POs because of either retirement or change in administration. Likewise, 
Management’s laxity in monitoring the implementation and accounting of fund 
transfers contributed to the minimal liquidation of prior years’ fund transfers.  

 
75. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the concerned officers of 

the DTI-CO and respective ROs to: 

 

a. exert effort to locate the former persons in charge in the liquidation of the 
fund transfer and acquire the necessary information and/or related 

documents; 

 

b. require the IAs on the prompt submission of liquidation reports upon 
completion/delivery of each project and refund unutilized balances, if any; 

 

c. require the Chief Accountant to send demand letters to agencies with 
outstanding unliquidated fund transfers; and 

 

d. institute a monitoring mechanism/system that would aid in the attainment 
of a higher rate, if not full liquidation, of fund transfers.  

 

Non- liquidation of fund transfers to PS-DBM and PITC 
 

76. Twelve ROs have no fund transfers to Procurement Service-Department of 
Budget and Management (PS-DBM) and Philippine International Trading 

Corporation (PITC) for its common office supplies and equipment requirement 

during the year, and no unliquidated fund transfers in prior years. In ROs III 

and V, fund transfers to PS-DBM for its common use office supplies and 

equipment requirement during the year amounting to ₱0.175 million and 

₱0.357 million, respectively, were granted and liquidated, in accordance with 

COA Circular No. 94-013.  In DTI-CO,  fund transfers to PS-DBM during the 
year amounted to ₱14.010 million, and ₱8.726 million were liquidated, leaving 



20 | P a g e  

 

a balance of ₱5.284 million.  Moreover, in DTI-CO and RO VI, there were still 

unliquidated fund transfers to PS-DBM and PITC in prior years amounting to 

₱45.799 million or 42.37 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱108.093 million. 
 

77. EO No. 359, dated June 2, 1989, provides that agencies shall remit in advance to the 
PS-DBM the funds need to service their requirements for supplies, materials and 
equipment as reflected in the Work and Financial Plan. 
 

78. Section 20 of the General Provisions of the GAA 2020 provides that: “All agencies 
of the government shall purchase its commonly used supplies requirements from PS-
DBM as mandated under LOI 755 dated October 18, 1978, EO 359, s.1989, and AO 
17, s. 2011 and such other guidelines issued thereon.” 
 

79. Item 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013 provides that it is the duty and responsibility 
of the Implementing Agency (IA) to return to the Source Agency (SA) any unused 
balance upon completion of the project. 

 
80. ROs except ROs III, V, and VI, had no fund transfers to PS-DBM and PITC for its 

common office supplies and equipment requirement during the year, and no 
unliquidated balances in prior years.  

 
81. ROs III and V transferred funds to PS-DBM for its common use office supplies 

amounting to ₱0.175 million and ₱0.357 million, respectively, which were granted 
and liquidated in accordance with COA Circular No. 94-013.  

 
82. In DTI-CO,  fund transfers to PS-DBM during the year amounted to ₱14.010 million, 

and ₱8.726 million were liquidated, leaving an unliquidated balance of ₱5.284 
million, representing items that are not available in stock at the PS-DBM.  Moreover, 
the DTI-CO and RO VI have still unliquidated fund transfers to PS-DBM and PITC 
in prior years amounting to ₱45.799 million or 42.37 percent of prior year’s balance 
of ₱108.093 million.  Details shown follows:

83. On November 29, 2017, the DTI-CO entered into a Memorandum of Agreement 
(MOA) with the PITC for the procurement of various goods and services for the 
requirement of DTI’s internal clients and/or end-user units. 

  
84. Salient provisions of the MOA are as follows: 
 

Article IV.B paragraph 10“Upon completion of each procurement project, 
PITC shall submit to DTI a liquidation Report and return to DTI the 
unexpended balance of funds transferred and/or deposited in the MOA 
Account for that particular project including any and all income earned in 
accordance with Article II.3 hereof.” 

 
Article II.3 “It is hereby agreed that interest earned, based on the prevailing 
interest rate on interest bearing checking account/s with the authorized 
government depository bank at the time of fund transfer, on the funds 
transferred by the DTI to PITC shall be for the account of DTI.”  

 
85. As of December 31, 2020, of the PYs fund transfer, the amount of ₱3.099 million 

remained unliquidated and the unutilized balance of ₱0.603 million is still not 
refunded by the PITC, bringing the outstanding balance to ₱3.702 million. This is a 
reiteration of our prior year’s observation since no refund or action taken was made 
by the PITC. Below is the status of the funds transferred by DTI-CO to PITC:

87. Management of DTI-CO commented that the Procurement Management Division 

(PMD) will submit the list of deliveries made by the PS-DBM in CY 2020 to the 
Accounting Division, and coordinate with the PS-DBM to refund the 2019 unutilized 
fund. Management also commented that they have already sent a letter to the PITC 
to refund the excess funds of ₱0.603 million and the unutilized project funds of 
₱3.099 million.  
 

88. Management of RO VI commented that the Supply Officer had made several follow-
ups with PS-DBM for the release of the requested office supplies, the latest was on 
February 5, 2021.  Unfortunately, they were informed again that there was no 
available stock of the requested supplies.  Other options offered by PS-DBM was the 
delivery of other items/supplies available in exchange of the supplies requested.  
However, they could not accept the offer because the supplies requested were the ones 
they needed as stipulated in the Approved Procurement Request (APR). Moreover, 
the remaining airline ticket amounting to ₱11,728.16 was not utilized due to COVID-
19 travel restrictions. 

 
89. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the:  
 

a) DTI-CO to instruct the (i) Accountant and Property Officer to coordinate 
with the PS-DBM to facilitate the deliveries of the items procured in 2019 

and/or refund the cost of undelivered or request for the replacement of 

undelivered items through the preparation of the new Agency Procurement 

Requests (APRs); and (ii) Finance Service to remind PITC not only to refund 

unutilized fund of ₱3.702 million but to pay any interest earned that has 

accrued to the unutilized fund pursuant to the provisions in the MOA; and 

 



23 | P a g e  

 

b) RO VI to make constant follow-up with the PS-DBM to facilitate the delivery 
of the items requested, or refund the cost of the undelivered items, if can no 

longer be delivered. 

 

Dormant accounts not requested for write-off 

90. Six ROs have no dormant receivable, unliquidated cash advances, and fund 
transfers for write-off. In DTI-CO,  ROs I, II, III, V, IX, X and XII, dormant 

receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers amounting 

to ₱110.749 million were not requested for write-off or requests were made but 

were returned due to insufficiency of documents.  In CAR, request for write-off 

was submitted, but still for review by the Audit Team.  
 

91. COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, prescribes the guidelines and 
procedures on the write-off of dormant receivables and fund transfers of NGAs, 
LGUs and GOCCs. Pertinent provisions are as follows: 

 
“5.4. Dormant Receivable Accounts – accounts which balances remained 
inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for ten (10) years or more 
and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.” 

 
5.6. Dormant Unliquidated Fund Transfers- advances granted by the source 
entity to implementing entity for the implementation of programs/projects

8.2. The Head of the government entity shall file the request for authority to 
write-off dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and 
fund transfers to the COA Audit Team Leader (ATL) and/or Supervising

92. Section 8.3 of same Circular states that the request shall be supported by: 

 
a) Schedule of dormant accounts by accountable 

officer/debtor/government entity and by account, certified by the 
accountant and approved by the Head of the government entity. 

 
b) Certified relevant documents validating the existence of the conditions, 

as applicable, such as: 
 

b.1 The Accountant shall “prepare aging of dormant receivables, 
unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers on a quarterly 
basis to support the request for write-off, and indicate in the 
remarks column the existence of the applicable conditions as

ii. Certification from the Department of Trade and Industry that 

the debtor has no registered business 
iii. Certification from the Securities and Exchange Commission 

that the Corporation is no longer active 
iv. Certification of no residence in the barangay of the 

municipality/city of last known address

relative to the account 

vii. Certification by the responsible officials of the entity to the 
effect that there are no records/documents available to validate

reconciliation shall be supported by certification by the Chief 
Accountants and approved by the Heads of the source and

93. Receivables amounting to ₱110.749 million remained dormant for 10 to 22 years for 

DTI-CO, ROs I, II, V, IX, X, and XII and were not requested for write-off/requested 
but returned due to insufficiency of documents/segregation of requests, as required 
under COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. Details are as follows:

94. In RO XII, Management previously requested for authority to write-off in CY 2018.  

However, it was not in accordance with the guidelines and procedures provided in 
the afore-mentioned Circular. For CY 2020, it was noted that they have not yet 
managed to gather sufficient documents to support their request for write-off. 
 

95. In DTI-CO, request for write-off was submitted in April 2019, but were returned 
without action due to inadequacy of documents to warrant the grant of write-off.   
Likewise, RO III reported that the agency had pending request for write-off of long 
outstanding Loans Receivable balance of ₱33.53 million, which were returned for 
compliance and segregation of requests on a per account basis. 

 
96. In CAR, the agency has submitted a request for write-off of dormant Loans 

Receivable-Others and its corresponding Interest Receivable amounting to ₱7.593 
million and ₱0.258 million, respectively. The request for write-off is still under 
review by the audit team. 
 

97. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountants of:  
 

a) ROs I, II, V, IX, and X to request for authority to write-off the dormant 
receivables in accordance with the guidelines and  procedures  embodied    in  

COA Circular No. 2016-005;  

 



26 | P a g e  

 

b) DTI-CO, ROs XII, and III to exert extra effort to submit the 
required/alternative documents and/or proof of actions undertaken for the 

recovery of such dormant accounts but to no avail,  to support the request 

for write-off of dormant accounts.  

 

Physical assets insured with the GSIS 
 
98. The DTI-CO and eight ROs insured property amounting to ₱834.163 million 

with the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) with corresponding 

insurance premiums paid in the amount of ₱7.027 million, in accordance with 

RA No. 656, otherwise known as the “Property Insurance Law”, as amended by 

PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973. However, the physical assets of ROs III, IX and 

XII with a total net book value of ₱50.530 million were not insured against fire 

or theft with the GSIS, hence, the agency is at risk of not being indemnified in 

case of damage or loss of property. 
 
99. Section 5 of RA No. 656 or the Property Insurance Law states that: 

 
“Every government, except a municipal government below first class, is 
hereby required to insure its properties, with the Fund against any insurable 
risk herein provided and pay the premiums thereon, which, however, shall 
not exceed the premiums charged by private insurance companies: 
Provided, however, That the System reserves the right to disapprove the 
whole or a portion of the amount of insurance applied for: Provided, 
further, That such property or part thereof as may not be insurable or 
acceptable for insurance may be insured with any private insurance 
company. xxx” 

 
100. COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018, provides the guidelines prescribing 

the submission of Property Inventory Form (PIF) not later than April 30 of each year. 
 

101. The DTI-CO, ROs CAR, I, II, IV-A, V, VI, XI and XIII insured property, amounting 
to ₱834.163 million with the GSIS with corresponding insurance premiums paid in 
the amount of ₱7.027 million in conformity with the aforementioned regulations, 
shown as follows:

were not insured against fire or theft with the GSIS. Breakdown as follows:

Remarks 

RO III 23.740 The procurement of insurance for the DTI offices’ 
contents or movable properties was only initiated 
on the latter part of CY 2020 for which only the 
regional office became compliant to. Currently, on-
going coordination with the provincial offices is 
being done by the Regional Property Officer for the 
procurement of insurance for movable properties in 
provincial offices.  

RO IX 22.171 Management did not prepare the required Property 
Inventory Form 

RO XII   4.619  
Total 50.530  

  
103. The non-coverage of all insurable physical assets with the GSIS Insurance Fund 

exposes the agency to the risk of not being indemnified or compensated for any 
damage to, or loss of its property thru theft, in cases of destruction of property 
through fire, flood or other force majeure. In a way, insuring government property 
helps mitigate the risk of probable losses to the government. It also deprived the GSIS 
of substantial premium income that should have formed part of its GIF. 

 
104. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the ROs III, IX, and XII 

to:  
 

a) comply with the existing insurance law and regulations by insuring with the 
General Insurance Fund of GSIS all insurable agency assets; and  

 
b) instruct the Property Officer to prepare the required Property Inventory 

Form and make proper and timely coordination with the GSIS for the 

necessary requirements in the insuring the agency property. 
 
Non-disposal of unserviceable property 

105. Six ROs properly disposed of their unserviceable property for CY 2020 and two 
ROs have no unserviceable property for disposal.  However, the DTI-CO and 

five ROs did not dispose of their unserviceable property with an aggregate value 

of ₱28.410 million, contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 1445, thus, exposing them 

to further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value. 



28 | P a g e  

 

106. Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) 1445 on the destruction or sale of 
unserviceable property provides that - “When government property has become 
unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the 
officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly 
authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to 
be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be 
valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder xxx xxx If the public 
auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such price as may be fixed 
by the same committee or body concerned and approved by the Commission.” 

 
107. The unserviceable property of the DTI-CO, ROs II, VII, VIII, IX, and XII with an 

aggregate value of ₱28.410 million remained not disposed of, thus, exposing them to 
further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value, shown as follows:

DTI-CO 20.480

RO VII   1.913 
RO VIII   0.155 
RO IX   0.743 
RO XII   4.041 
Total 28.410 

 
108. Management commented that the non-disposal of the unserviceable property was due 

to failure to assign or designate personnel to undertake the work.  
 

109. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the DTI-CO and ROs II, 
VII, VIII, IX, and XII to immediately reconstitute a disposal committee to 

handle the disposal of unserviceable property to prevent further deterioration 

or decrease in their realizable value.  
 
Emergency procurement activities during a state of calamity 

110. The procurement of DTI-CO, ROs I, II, III, IV-A, V, and XI of starter kits, and 
other services and supplies and machinery requirements for the LSP-NSB and 

BP-SSF projects were found to be in accordance with Section 53.2 of the 2016 

RIRR of RA No. 9184 and GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 dated April 6, 2020.  

However, procurement through public bidding and negotiated procurement 

were not conducted in accordance with Sections 23.1, 32, 39.1 and 39.2 of the 

2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184 in seven ROs.   
  

111. Section 53.2 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of 
Republic Act (RA) No. 9184 provides that: “Instances when Negotiated Procurement 
under Emergency Cases may be resorted to under the following:  i.) In case of 
imminent danger to life or property during a state of calamity, or ii.) When time is of 



29 | P a g e  

 

the essence arising from natural or man-made calamities or iii.) Other causes where 
immediate action is necessary: a) to prevent damage to or loss of life or property, or 
b) to restore vital public services, infrastructure facilities and other public utilities.” 

 
112. Government Procurement and Policy Board (GPPB) Circular No. 01-2020 dated 

April 6, 2020, provides for the Guidelines for Emergency Procurement under RA No. 
11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act. 

 
113. Section 23.1 of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184 provides for the eligibility 

requirements for the procurement of goods and infrastructure projects. One of the 
legal eligibility documents required is the Tax Clearance, per Executive Order (E.O.) 
398, s. 2005, as finally reviewed and approved by the Bureau of Internal Revenue 
(BIR). 

 
114. Section 32 of the same RIRR provides for the procedures in the bid evaluation for 

the procurement of goods and infrastructure projects. 
 

115. Meanwhile, Section 39.1 provides that to guarantee the faithful performance by the 
winning bidder of its obligations under the contract in accordance with the Bidding 
Documents, it shall post a performance security prior to the signing of the contract. 
Section 39.2 further requires that the performance security shall be in an amount not 
less than the required percentage of the total contract price, in accordance with the 
schedule indicated therein. The amount required when the security is in the form of 
cash or cashier’s/manager’s check issued by a Universal or Commercial Bank, or in 
the form of surety bond callable upon demand issued by a surety or insurance 
company duly certified by the Insurance Commission as authorized to issue such 
security, shall not be less than five percent in case of goods and consulting services. 

 
116. Section 23.4.1.4 of the Revised IRR of RA 9184 provides:  
 

“The computation of a bidder’s NFCC must be at least equal to the ABC to be bid, 
calculated as follows: NFCC=[(Current assets minus current liabilities) (15)] minus 
the value of all outstanding or uncompleted portions of the projects under ongoing 
contracts, including awarded contracts yet to be started, coinciding with the contract 
to be bid. The values of the domestic bidder’s current assets and current liabilities 
shall be based on the latest Audited Financial Statements submitted to the BIR. For 
purposes of computing the foreign bidders' NFCC, the value of the current assets 
and current liabilities shall be based on their Audited Financial Statements prepared 
in accordance with international financial reporting standards.” 
 

117. The procurement of starter kits, and other services and supplies and machinery 
requirements for the Livelihood Seeding Program-Negosyo Serbisyo sa Barangay 
(LSP-NSB) and Balik Probinsya-Shared Service Facility (BP-SSF) projects of DTI-
CO, ROs I, II, III, IV-A, V, and XI were found to be in accordance with Section 53.2 
of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184 and GPPB Circular No. 01-2020.

39.2 of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184, due to the Bids and Awards 
Committee’s (BAC) failure to exercise prudence, thus, cannot be assessed 
as the most advantageous to the government. 
Likewise, in RO VIII procurements of various LSP-NSB Starter kits worth 
₱16.386 million through Public Bidding and Negotiated Procurement were 
not in accordance with Section 23.4.1.4, Section 62.1, and Item 3.1, Annex

Budget Circular No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020, and Department Order 
(DO) No. 20-54 and 63, Series of 2020, due to laxity of controls in the

ROs  Deficiencies/Observations 

Moreover, in RO IX, awarded contracts amounting to ₱17.709 million 
were not posted in the website of the PE, while in CAR, Modified allotment 
amounting to ₱0.878 million from the regular budget for the COVID-19 
initiatives was not approved by the Secretary, contrary to Section 70 of RA 
No. 11465 and Section 5.2.3.1 of NBC No. 578. 
 
In RO I, disbursements incurred under LSP-NSB and LSP– 
Pangkabuhayan sa pagBangon at Ginhawa (LSP-PBG) for CY 2020 
amounting to ₱2.075 million were not adequately supported with required 
documents/reports contrary to Section 4(6) of PD 1445 precluding the 
complete review/audit of transactions pertaining thereto, thereby casting 
doubts as to the validity, propriety, and regularity of the payment of said 
expenditures. Likewise, there were no documentations that would evidence 
the proper distribution of the livelihood kits and if the identified 
beneficiaries from the different municipalities in RO I were the ones who 
received the kits. As it is, it would appear that DO No. 20-11 series of 2020 
dated January 15, 2020, was not strictly complied with. 

 
119. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Regional Directors and 

concerned officers of ROs CAR, IV-A, IV-B, VI, IX, XII and XIII to: 
 

ROs VI, CAR, IX and XIII – 

 
a) submit the lacking supporting documents required under GPPB Circular 

No. 01-2020 dated April 6, 2020, and ensure the completeness of eligibility 

and documentary requirements in the processing, approval and awarding of 

contracts; 

 
b) submit immediately the lacking necessary documents pursuant to PD No. 

1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001 to establish the reasonableness and 

validity of the transactions;  

 
c) strengthen the agency’s internal control system by conducting effective 

review of disbursement vouchers and accomplishing checklist of 

documentary requirements before certifying the transaction to ensure 

completeness of documentations and validity claims. 

 

ROs CAR and IX –  

 

d) conduct Emergency Procurement, whenever applicable, following the 
procedures prescribed by the GPPB through its issuances; 

 

ROs CAR and XII – 

 

e) require the BAC Secretariat to cause the consolidation of the updated 
PPMPs and prepare the Supplemental APP in adherence to the guidelines 

set forth in Section 7 of RA 9184 and Section 3.2 of GPPB Circular No. 01-



32 | P a g e  

 

2020; and submit the APP/Supplemental APPs (both in hard and soft 

copies), including a copy of the transmittal of all the approved APP and 

Supplemental APPs to GPPB;  

 

RO IV-B – 

 

f) BAC to henceforth exercise utmost prudence and strictly observe the 
procedural requirements in the procurement and award of contracts made 

through public bidding, particularly in the determination of the eligibility of 

the bidders and sufficiency of the securities posted by the bidders, and in 

conducting detailed bid evaluation; 

 

RO VIII – 

 

g) instruct the BAC to provide a justification on allowing the erroneous NFCC 
as compliance with eligibility requirement during the evaluation of bids and 

strictly adhere on the provisions of 2016 RIRR of RA 9184 and COA 

Circular No. 2012-001. 

 

Delayed submission of government contracts 
 
120. Two ROs submitted copies of government contracts and their supporting 

documents to the COA within the prescribed period, in accordance with Items 

3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001.  However, in the DTI-CO and six 

ROs, contracts and POs totaling 2,542 with corresponding amount of ₱740.076 

million were not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging 

from one to 363 days as of year-end. Moreover, in RO XIII, 149 POs amounting 

to ₱2.831 million were not properly accomplished. Furthermore, in RO V, 32 

contracts in the total amount of ₱41.677 million submitted for review were not 

supported with complete documentation. 

  
121. Items 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, 

provides –  
 

3.1.1 “Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by 
the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or 
instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled 
corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each 
of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or 
incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency 
concerned. In case of agencies audited on an engagement basis, 
submission of a copy of the contract and its supporting documents 
shall be to the Auditor of the mother agency or parent company, as 
the case may be.”

3.2.1 Copy of any purchase order irrespective of amounts and its 
supporting documents, shall, within five (5) working days from

122. ROs III and IV-A complied with the prescribed guidelines on the submission of copy 
of contracts, and submitted a total of 376 contracts with a total amount of ₱19.109 
million.  However, in the DTI-CO and ROs I, II, V, IX, XIII and CAR, contracts and

123. Moreover, in RO XIII, 149 POs for the procurement of supplies, repairs and 

maintenance, meals and accommodations amounting to ₱2.831 million were not 
properly accomplished as to PO number and date, payment and delivery terms, place 
and date of delivery, signature and date confirmed by the supplier, therefore 
compliance with the terms and conditions on the delivery of goods and services 
cannot be determined and preclude the imposition of liquidated damages upon failure 
of the suppliers to deliver within the stipulated date. Furthermore, in RO V, 32 
contracts in the total amount of ₱41.677 million submitted for review were not 
supported with complete documentation. On the other hand, seven ROs namely: RO 
IV-B, VI, VII, VIII, X, XI and XII have no report on this area.  

 



34 | P a g e  

 

124. In the DTI-CO, per inquiry with the staff of the PMD, the delay in the submission 
was due to the heavy workload of the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) in the PMD. As a 
result, COA is precluded from conducting a review intended to assist the agency in 
identifying and mitigating possible errors and risks associated with contracting for 
goods and/or services.  

 
125. In RO I, management acknowledged that there were delays in the submission of the 

Purchase Orders or Contracts within five days from the date of approval/issuance to 
Suppliers and from the perfection of the contracts. In as much as they wanted to 
submit regularly and comply on time, the same could not be done due to the 
voluminous transactions on procurement and workload of the concerned personnel. 
They also requested that the reckoning period in the counting of the delays in 
submission be from the date it was signed/confirmed by the supplier and not the date 
indicated in the POs since it usually takes time before the PO is confirmed and 
returned by the supplier. Likewise, submission of the contracts shall reckon within 
five days after it is notarized.  

 
126. In RO IX, the non-submission and delays in submission were due to the failure of 

the concerned agency officials to monitor its submission and on the agency’s laxity 
to observe timeliness on the submission of reports which affects the recording of the 
transactions and events in the books of accounts. 

 
127. In CAR, monitoring and submission of the POs were inadvertently overlooked due 

to the various daily tasks they need to accomplish.  
 
128. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the concerned officers of 

the Procurement Division of: 

 

a) DTI-CO and ROs I, II, V, IX, XIII and CAR to designate a Procurement 
Personnel to take charge in the submission of the copies of contracts, POs 

and work orders, together with the required supporting documents to COA 

within five days upon perfection/issuance thereof; 
 

b) RO XIII to properly accomplish the POs in accordance with Appendix 61, 
Volume II of the GAM for NGAs; and 

 

c) RO V to submit the lacking supporting documents for submitted contracts. 
 
Withholding and remittance of GSIS contributions, loans and employer's share 

129. The DTI-CO and 13 ROs  properly deducted the GSIS personal share and loans 
of employees amounting to ₱178.613 million, and remitted without delay the 

amount of ₱177.785 million, and government share of ₱40.401 million for CY 

2020,  in accordance with RA No. 8291, the GSIS Act of 1997,  leaving a balance 

of ₱0.828 million. However, RO IV-B withheld personal share and loans 



35 | P a g e  

 

amounting to ₱6.020 million and remitted ₱5.479 million with delay of 13 to 91 

days leaving an unremitted amount of ₱0.537 million. Government share of 

₱1.231 million, were likewise remitted with delays of 13 to 91 days.  

 

130. Section 13 of the IRR of RA No. 8291 states that “it shall be compulsory upon the 
government agency to deduct from the fixed monthly compensation the personal 
share of the members and to promptly remit the same to GSIS.” 

 
131. Moreover, Sections 14.2 and 14.3 of the same RA provides that the government 

agency shall also deduct from the fixed monthly compensation of the employee the 
loan amortizations (consolidated loans, policy loan, emergency loan, housing loan, 
and other loans), premium payments (optional, pre-need and other non-life 
insurance) and other amounts due the GSIS.  The said amounts shall be remitted to 
the GSIS within the first ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month 
when the deductions were effected, accompanied by supporting lists in the form 
prescribed by the GSIS. 

 
132. DTI-CO and 13 ROs deducted and remitted the GSIS contributions and loans 

amounting to ₱178.613 million including beginning balance, and remitted ₱177.785 
million, leaving a balance of ₱0.828 million. Government share amounting to 
₱40.401 million were also remitted as shown below:

days leaving an unremitted balance of ₱0.537 million. Likewise, government share 
amounting to ₱1.231 million were also remitted with delays of 13 to 91 days.

134. Management commented that they did not incur any delay based on the validation of 
the LDDAP-ADA, but the Audit Team of RO IV-B insisted that there was a delay 
based on the remittances made through check and date of the official receipt.  
 

135. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant of: 
 

a) DTI-CO and ROs VII and XI to remit immediately the balance of ₱0.828 
million to the GSIS as required under Section 14.2 and 14.3 of the IRR of 

RA No. 8291; and 

 

b) RO IV-B to effect the timely and accurate remittance of employees’ 
premium contributions, loan amortization and government’s share to 

GSIS, by informing immediately the GSIS that remittance checks are ready 

for pick up, to avoid delay.  Also, remit immediately the balance of ₱0.537 

million as required under the aforementioned RA. 

 

Withholding and remittance of PhilHealth contributions and employer's share 
 
136. DTI-CO and 13 ROs properly withheld and remitted without delay the 

PhilHealth personal share of employees for CY 2020 amounting to ₱15.781 

million and ₱15.739 million, respectively, and employer’s share amounting to 

₱11.979 million, in accordance with RA No. 7875, as amended by RA No. 9241 

(National Health Insurance Act of 1995). The remaining balance of ₱0.086 

million is subject to reconciliation and adjustment.  However, RO IV-B withheld 

and remitted PhilHealth personal share of employees for CY 2020 amounting 

to ₱0.462 million and ₱0.410 million with delay ranging from 1 to 102 days 

leaving an unremitted balance of  ₱0.052 million, contrary to RA No. 9241. 

 

137. Section 18 (b) of the National Health Insurance Act of 2013 (R.A No. 7875 as 
Amended by R.A No. 9241 and 10606) provides that “The monthly premium 
contribution of employed members shall be remitted by the employer on or before 
the date prescribed by the Corporation.” 

 
138. Pursuant to the above said provision the PhilHealth issued Circular No. 0001, series 

of 2014, for the revised payment schedule as follows: 
 

Employers with PENs ending in 0-4 Every 11th-15th day of the month following 
the applicable period

amounting to ₱0.462 million and ₱0.410 million, with delays ranging from 1 to 102 
days, leaving an unremitted balance of ₱0.052 million, contrary to RA No. 9241. 
 

141. Management commented that they did not incur any delays based on the date of 
validation of the LDDAP-ADA, however, the Audit Team emphasized that the delay 
was based on the dates of the Official Receipts which were significantly far from the 
dates of validation of the LDDAP-ADAs. 

 
142. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant of: 

 

a) DTI-CO and ROs VI and VII to exert extra effort in reconciling the balance 
of ₱0.086 million and remit immediately upon reconciliation; and  

 

b) RO IV-B to effect the timely remittance of PhilHealth employees’ premium

₱0.028 million which is subject to reconciliation/adjustment, if warranted.  

Likewise, the employer’s share amounting to ₱2.915 million was remitted 

without delay. 

 

144. Rule VII of the IRR of the Pag-IBIG Fund Law discusses the collection and 
remittance of the Pag-IBIG contributions and loan amortizations. Pertinent provision 
on the remittance of collections is as follows: 

 
Section 3. Remittance of Collections. 

 
a. All employers shall remit to the Fund their contributions and the 

contributions of their covered employees as well as the latter’s loan 
amortizations or payments to the Fund, as provided for under Section 
2 of this Rule, when applicable, within fifteen (15) days from the date 
the same were collected unless another period is previously agreed 
upon between the employer and the Fund, or within such periods as the 
Fund may prescribe otherwise. Xxx 

 
145. Further, Item 4 (E), Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) Circular No. 275 

dated January 22, 2010, provides that “Employers shall remit the required monthly 
employer and employee contributions to the nearest Pag-IBIG branch or its

Failure or refusal of the employer to pay or to remit the contributions herein 
prescribed shall not prejudice the right of the covered member to the benefits under 
the Fund. Such employer shall be charged a penalty equivalent to 1/10 of 1% per day 
of delay of the amount due starting on the first day immediately following the due 
date until the date of full settlement.”

Receipts and Disbursement of Funds 

 

186. Of the total allotments of ₱344.948 million allotted for COVID-19 initiatives,

the purpose of appropriation/allotment. Likewise, total disbursements of 

₱247.692 million was only 79.89 percent of the total obligations. The low fund 

utilization and disbursement rates were due to low fund utilization and 

disbursement rates of 74.78 percent and 22.85 percent, respectively, of the funds 

for the BP-SSF Project under Bayanihan Act Two which was released only in 

the fourth quarter of CY 2020, after the enactment of RA No. 11494, otherwise 

known as the “Bayanihan to Recover as One Act” on September 11, 2020.  

 

187. Section 60 of General Provisions, RA No. 11465 (GAA, FY 2020) provides that: 
 

All appropriations authorized in this Act, xxx, shall be available for release

190. Of the total allotments of ₱344.948 million allotted for COVID-19 initiatives, only 
the amount of ₱310.044 million was utilized/obligated in accordance with the 
purpose of appropriation/allotment. Likewise, total disbursements of ₱247.692 
million was only 79.89 percent of the total obligations.  
 

191. The BP-SSF, a DTI project under the Balik Probinsya, Bagong Pag-asa Program, to 
provide for the establishment of SSFs across the country, as particularly 
recommended by the Inter-Agency Task Force Technical Working Group for 
Anticipatory and Forward Planning (IATF-TWG AFP) in its "We Recover As One" 
Report as a priority strategy for scaling-up of MSME products through 
manufacturing technologies in the New Normal, had a fund utilization and 
disbursement rates of 74.78 percent and 22.85 percent, respectively. This is however 
justifiable since the funds for the BP-SSF were released in the fourth quarter of the 
year following the enactment of RA 11494, otherwise known as the “Bayanihan to 
Recover as One Act” on September 11, 2020.

alcohol, disinfectant, face mask, face shield, payment of hazard pay and overtime 
pay, publication of DTI issuances relative to the implementing guidelines issued by 
IATF and other expenses charged against the regular budget of the DTI and its ROs 
also had a high fund utilization and disbursement rates of 100 percent.   

 
195. The overall low fund utilization and disbursement rates of 89.86 percent and 79.85 

percent, respectively, were due to late releases of funds for the BP-SSF Project under 
Bayanihan Act Two which was released only in the fourth quarter of CY 2020 after 
the enactment of RA No. 11494, otherwise known as the “Bayanihan to Recover as 
One Act” on September 11, 2020.

200. The DTI-CO and other ROs reported several deficiencies as discussed below: 
  

a) Distributed livelihood kits were either below or above the authorized amount 
of ₱5,000.00 to ₱8,000.00 

 
201. The costs of the livelihood kits distributed by DTI-CO and ROs V and XI exceeded 

the authorized budget ceiling of ₱5,000.00 to ₱8,000.00, resulting in an excess cost 
over the allotted amount of ₱0.350 million. While the distributed livelihood kits of 
RO I and other kits distributed by RO XI were below the aforementioned authorized 
budget ceiling, thus shortchanging the beneficiaries of the full amount of the 
assistance. 

 

202. Despite the provision of an authorized budget ceiling in the grant of financial 
assistance under DTI DO No. 20-54 s. 2020, the DTI-CO, RO V, and XI, distributed 
livelihood kits with cost exceeding the authorized ceiling of ₱8,000.00 resulting in 
an excess cost over the authorized amount of ₱0.350 million.  On the other hand, 
the distributed livelihood kits of RO I and other kits distributed by RO XI, were  
below the authorized range of financial benefits, thus, shortchanging the 
beneficiaries of the full amount of the assistance.  Shown as follows: 

 
DTI Office No of kits/ Beneficiaries Excess Cost 

CO     8 4,176.00 
RO V 144 288,000.00 
RO XI     7 58,125.00 

Total  350,301.00 

 
203. In DTI-CO, cost of laundry kits of ₱8,222.00 distributed to 8 beneficiaries exceeded 

the authorized budget of ₱8,000.00, thus, an excess cost of ₱4,176.00. 
 

204. In RO V, there were 144 Sari-Sari Store kits costing ₱10,000.00 each, distributed 
to 144 beneficiaries, which exceeded the authorized budget of ₱8,000.00, thus, an 
excess cost of ₱288,000.00.

205. In RO XI, there were seven (7) kits with cost ranging from ₱10,674.00 to 
₱29,766.00 distributed to associations consisting of group of individuals, thus, 
resulting in an excess cost over the authorized amount of ₱58.125.00.   Also, cost 
of 773 various kits were below ₱5,000.00, hence not within the range of the 
authorized budget of ₱5,000.00 to ₱8,000.00. 

 
206. In RO I, some distributed livelihood kits given to beneficiaries cost ₱1,300.00   to 

₱3,600.00, which are far below the authorized budget of ₱5,000.00 to ₱8,000.00, 
thus shortchanging the beneficiaries of the full amount of the assistance. 

 
b) absence of documentary requirements to support the distribution of livelihood 

kits  
 
207. In ROs I, IV-A, IV-B, VI, IX, and XIII, the validity of the distribution of the 

procured livelihood kits amounting to ₱39.942 million was not ascertained due to 
the absence of documentary requirements prescribed under the aforementioned DTI 
DO, as follows:

a) DTI-CO, ROs V and XI to observe strictly the range of financial benefits 
to Five Thousand Pesos, but not more than Eight Thousand Pesos 

(₱5,000.00 – ₱8,000.00) authorized under DTI DO No. 54.  Excess cost of 

financial benefits granted will be disallowed in audit and shall be the sole 

responsibility of the officers authorizing it.  A separate ND will be issued 

for the excess cost over the authorized budget ceiling; and  

 

b) ROs I, IV-A, IV-B, VI, IX and XIII to submit the distribution list, 
supported with the duly signed acknowledgement receipts, pledged of 

commitments and masterlist of approved beneficiaries to validate the 

actual distribution of the livelihood kits and ensure that intended benefits 

had redound to the authorized beneficiaries. Failure to submit the 

requested documents will constrain the auditors concerned to issue the 

Notice of Suspensions.
