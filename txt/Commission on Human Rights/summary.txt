Rosales on May 5, 2015.  Assisting the Chairman in the operation of the CHR are four Commissioners, namely, Commissioners Karen S. Gomez-Dumpit, Gwendolyn Ll. Pimentel-Gana, Leah C. Tanodra-Armamento and Roberto Eugenio T. Cadiz.

The audit covered the financial transactions under the Regular Agency Fund as well as selected areas of operations of the CHR Central Office (CO) and its Regional Offices (ROs) for the period January 1 to December 31, 2020.  It was aimed to ascertain the propriety of the financial transactions and determine the fairness of presentation of the financial statements, and to ascertain compliance with laws, rules and regulations.

The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the CHR for CY 2020. 





E)	Audit Observations and Recommendations 



We have noted significant audit observations, for which corresponding recommendations were likewise offered, as follows: 

           Good Management Practices



	1)	The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) has implemented various audit recommendations and corrected/adjusted accounts affected by the deficiencies observed to help ensure a fair presentation of account balances reported in the financial statements as required under the IPSAS. (Observation No. 1)



	2)	Despite the threat of the COVID 19, the CHR conducted physical inventory of Property Plant and Equipment in CY 2020 and rendered the Report of Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) in compliance with the Government Accounting Manual and continuously resolved variances observed in previous year’s Annual Audit Report resulting in reconciled balances of PPE as of December 31, 2020. (Observation No. 2)



Other Audit Observations and Recommendations



	3)	Delays in disbursing the fund and to submit immediately the Report of Disbursements and Cash in Bank Register have caused the accumulation of Advances for Operating Expenses in the CHR Regional Offices totaling P11.258 million as at year end. (Observation No. 3)



We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) instruct further, thru Office Circular or Memorandum, all concerned Regional Offices to immediately liquidate their advances for operating expenses within 20 days after the end of the year and remind them to ensure strict compliance with COA Circular No. 97-002 and Section 11, Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM; (b) direct the concerned CHR Regional Offices to step up procurement activities to ensure timely liquidation of advances for operating expenses and ensure that all advances are liquidated at the end of each year; and (c) direct the CHR-CO Accountant to issue demand letter for all cash advances for operating expenses not yet liquidated. 



	4)	Various disbursements at CHR CAR, ROs III, IVB and XII totaling P1.013 million were not fully supported with complete documentation thus, casting doubt on the validity, legality and propriety of the transactions. (Observation No. 4)



We recommended and Management of concerned CHR ROs agreed to require their respective Accountants to review and verify the completeness and validity of the documentary requirements prior to payment of expenses. 



	5)	Out of the 291 total approved beneficiaries for CHR NCR, ROs I, IVA, IVB and XII, only 40 percent or a total of 117 were granted  total benefits of P1.831 million while the remaining 60 percent or a total of 174 approved beneficiaries with total benefits of P183,000.00  were not yet released as 35 beneficiaries have insufficient contact information needed for the release of the checks/delayed processing of benefit claims and 139 benefits claims were hampered due to delayed request for additional FA fund from CHR Central Office thus, the objectives of Financial and Community Assistance project has not fully been realized/attained. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended and Management agreed to require: (a) concerned CHR ROs to enhance payment processing by gathering needed documents and contact information of beneficiaries so that Financial and Community Assistance will be distributed on a timely basis; and (b) direct the CHR NCR, ROs IVA and XII to study the trend on the number of applicants and probable beneficiaries so that timely request and programming of needed funding and processing of payments be made to increase the number of beneficiaries to fully attain the purpose of the grants and to ensure that government humanitarian services are timely received by those concerned.



	6)	Delayed submission of financial reports and supporting documents in CHR-NCR, ROs I, II, III, IVA, IVB, XI and XII precluded the Audit Team to have a systematic and effective review of the documents with the end view of generating timely and relevant audit results that may be communicated to Management for their information and basis in their financial decision making purposes. (Observation No. 6)



We recommended and Management of concerned CHR-ROs agreed to require designated Accountants to comply with the rules and regulations on the submission of financial reports and corresponding supporting documents and ensure that these are submitted to the Auditor within the prescribed period.    



	7)	Financial processing, documentation and recording for Governance in Justice (GOJUST) - Human Rights were primarily held by the CHR Chief Accountant without a clear line of authority while custody of financial records was passed on to the Commission on Audit – CHR unnecessarily exposing the COA of custodial responsibility. (Observation No. 7)



We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) direct the GOJUST Technical Working Group to pull out all the financial documents, records and reports from the COA CHR Auditing unit to unburden them of unnecessary custodial responsibility; and (b) ensure that clear lines responsibility and accountability for financial processing and reporting of CHR personnel particularly the Accountant over custodial (private) fund is thoroughly delegated and defined on similar undertakings in the future.



	8)	Sixty-two units of unserviceable/obsolete PPEs totaling P3.770 million were not disposed of in the CHR ROs III, VI, IX and XIII as at December 31, 2020, thereby exposing such properties to further deterioration and depriving the agency of additional income from the immediate sale thereof. (Observation No. 8)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the: (a) disposal Committee of CHR ROs III and XIII to facilitate the immediate and systematic disposal of all unserviceable properties in accordance with existing rules and regulations in order to prevent their further deterioration and maximize recoverable values/income therefrom; (b) CHR RO VI to follow up the request for authority to dispose of the unserviceable properties from the CHR CO; and (c) disposal Committee of CHR RO IX to prepare IIRUP and cause the disposal of all unserviceable properties.
