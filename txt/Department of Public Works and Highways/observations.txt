PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
 
FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

Accounting Errors and Improper Accounting Treatment of Transactions 
 

1. Of the total misstatements of P28,011,733,218.00 found in audit due to accounting 
errors and improper accounting treatment of transactions that are considered 

departure from the International Public Sector Accounting Standards, 

P6,150,138,771.92 have been adjusted, while P21,861,594,446.08 remained 

uncorrected as at year-end. Hence, based on the material impact of the 

uncorrected misstatements, the reported balances of the affected accounts could 

not be fully relied upon which affect the fairness of the financial statements of the 

DPWH as of December 31, 2020. 
 

1.1 Section 27 of International Public Sector Accounting Standard (IPSAS) 1 provides 
that, “Financial Statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows of an entity.  Fair presentation requires the faithful 
representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 
revenues, and expenses set out in IPSASs.” 
 

1.2 Moreover, Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that the 
accounts of the agency shall be kept in such details as necessary to meet the needs of 
the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by the 
fiscal or control agencies of the government.  
 

1.3 Audit of the DPWH’s consolidated financial statements disclosed accounting errors 
and improper accounting treatment aggregating to P28,011,733,218.00, of which,  
P6,150,138,771.92 were adjusted in the books of accounts, leaving a total uncorrected 
misstatements of P21,861,594,446.08 (See Annex A). 
 

1.4 The uncorrected misstatements affecting several accounts are shown below, and 
discussed in detail in the succeeding paragraphs:

Statement (BRS) revealed that the year-end total Cash and Cash Equivalents account 
balance is overstated by a net amount of P152,642,251.65 due to the errors/omissions

Net overstatement  (152,642,251.65) 

 
1.6 Management of DPWH offices concerned in Regions NCR, I, and VIII, informed the 

Audit Team that the said errors/omissions totaling to P101,057,960.44 were already 
adjusted and corrected in CY 2021.  
 

1.7 The uncorrected/unadjusted amounts in DPWH RO X pertains to several accounts in 
the Cash in Bank–Local Currency, Current Account totaling to P51,584,291.21 that 
have been long dormant, no bank statements as well as other pertinent documents that 
could provide appropriate details and support on the composition and existence 
thereof. 

 
1.8 The existence of these questioned cash balances could not be traced to existing bank 

accounts under the name of DPWH RO X per confirmation made in 2018 to the 
authorized government banks of the regional office namely: Land Bank of the 
Philippines (LBP) and Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP). It was noted that 
the Management has requested for authority to write-off the amount as the Finance 
Division was unable to account the same. This amount has been carried forward in the 
books since 1994.  
 

1.9 Management of DPWH RO X committed to comply with the recommendation of COA 
of soliciting the help of DPWH Central Office to verify and establish the accounts in 
question and endorse them to GAS for appropriate action. 
 



105 
 

1.10 We recommended that Management direct the Accountant of the DPWH RO X 
to: 

 

a) draw Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) to make the necessary adjusting 
entries to correct the reported balances of Cash and Cash Equivalents 

account and the other corresponding accounts affected; and 

 

b) coordinate with the bank and/or obtain necessary documents to support the 
non-existing/not backed-up by cash amounts and subsequently make 

adjustments in the books. 

 

b. Net understatement of Receivables account – P1.057 million 
 
1.11 Section 7.2.1 (d) of the COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 states 

“The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing 
accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that the 
disallowance and charges that have become final and executory as contained in the 
Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) are recorded in the books of accounts, and 
settlements thereof under the NSSDC are dropped therefrom.” 
 

1.12 The year-end balance of Other Receivables account of the DPWH, is understated by 
P1,056,615.64 due to unrecorded disallowances as presented in the following table:

II Batanes DEO  256,212.34

Total 1,056,615.64 
 
1.13 Review and verification of the Receivables-Disallowances/Charges account in the 

financial statements of DPWH Batanes DEO and Cagayan 1st DEO revealed that 
Notices of Finality of Decision (NFDs) with various dates totaling P1,056,615.64 were 
not recorded in the books of accounts, contrary to the above-cited rules and regulations 
on the treatment of accounts which are final and executory, thus, understated the 
Receivables-Disallowances/Charges account by the same amount. 
 

1.14 We recommended that Management direct the Accountants concerned to record 
in the books of accounts the audit disallowances that have become final and 

executory as contained in the Notices of Finality of Decisions, duly received by 

the Management. The same should also be immediately enforced upon the 

persons named liable. 
 
1.15 The Management of Batanes and Cagayan 1st DEOs commented that the deficiency 

noted are already adjusted and corrected in CY 2021 under various JEVs drawn in 
January and February 2021. 
 
 



106 
 

c. Net Overstatement of Property, Plant and Equipment account – P20.138 billion 
 

1.16 IPSAS 17 defines Property, Plant and Equipment as tangible items that are held for 
use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for 
administrative purposes and are expected to be used during more than one reporting 
period. In relation to the financial statements issued, Management asserts the 
completeness, existence, its rights and obligations as well as correct valuations in the 
account balances presented therein. 
 

1.17 Chapter 10, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual for National 
Government Agencies (GAM for NGAs) provides the basic accounting policies and 
principles on PPE in accordance with the IPSAS. 
 

1.18 The reported total balance of PPE account as of December 31, 2020 is  overstated by 
a net amount of P20,138,077,207.87 due to the following errors and omissions:

Net overstatement (20,138,077,207.87) 

 
i. Unrecorded Property, Plant and Equipment – P318.683 million 

 
1.19 Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides the following provisions: 
 

 Section 7 – Acquisition is the process through which one entity gains possession 
or takes over the ownership of a particular PPE. 

 
 Section 8.g – During the construction period, all expenses incurred in relation to 

the construction of the PPE shall be taken up in the books as Construction in 
Progress (CIP) with the appropriate asset classification. As soon as the 
construction is completed, the “Construction in Progress” account shall be 



107 
 

reclassified to the proper asset account. Likewise, all expenses such as interests, 
license fees, etc., during the construction period shall be capitalized. 

 
 Section 14 – Transfer from one government entity to another shall be recognized 

by the recipient agency at net carrying value. The transferor shall derecognize the 
PPE account upon transfer. 

 
1.20 Various PPEs acquired and donated to the agency amounting to P318,683,240.40 were 

not recorded in the books of accounts of the DPWH, thus understated the PPE account 
by the same amount, details as follows:

1.21 The Management of DPWH offices in NCR and CAR informed the Audit Teams that 
some of the foregoing errors/omissions were already adjusted and corrected in CY 
2021, in the amounts of P196,761,504.27 and P24,625,396.90, respectively.   
 

1.22 The Audit Teams shall monitor and verify Management’s adjustments/corrections to 
present fairly the PPE account. 
 

ii. Non-derecognition of completed projects that were physically transferred and 
already in the possession of the end-users/recipient agencies – P2.030 billion 

 
1.23 The General Guidelines of DPWH Department Order (DO) No. 176, s. 2015, states 

that, “The Infrastructure Assets that shall be recorded in the DPWH PPE accounts 
are Roads, Highways and Bridges and Flood Control Structures. All other 
infrastructure assets constructed or implemented by the DPWH but the maintenance 
of which are the responsibility of other agencies, shall be transferred to the respective 
recipient agency by the Implementing Office of the project, upon completion. For these 
assets, the depreciation shall be recognized only in the books of the recipient agency.” 
 

1.24 Completed projects constructed by various DPWH offices such as, water supply 
systems, local infrastructure projects and other structures that were physically 
transferred and already utilized by the end-users/recipient agencies, are still carried in 
the books of DPWH, thus overstating the PPE account by P2,030,113,834.83. Details 
are as follows:

1.25 The project costs have not been derecognized from the books of accounts of the 

DPWH offices concerned due to lack of turn-over documents, such as Property 



109 
 

Acknowledgement Receipts (PARs)/ Property Transfer Reports (PTRs) as bases for 
adjustments by the respective Accounting Divisions. 
 

1.26 In Davao Oriental 2nd DEO, adjusting and correcting entries have been made in CY 
2021 under various JEVs totaling P1,544,682,860.21. 

 
iii. Completed infrastructure projects of DPWH OSEC, not yet transferred or 

turned-over to the recipient agencies and/or end-users – P18.688 billion 
 

1.27 DO No. 88, series of 1989 dated July 10, 1989, states that, “infrastructure projects of 
different types, funded either under the Regular Infrastructure Allotment, Foreign 
Assisted or Countrywide Development funds when finally completed shall be turned-
over to the end-users or entities concerned.” 
 

1.28 Review of the individual SL accounts revealed that 2,252 completed projects with total 
costs of P18,688,047,967.52 are still carried in the books of the DPWH under the CIP 
account, instead of transferring them to the recipient agencies and/or end-users, thus 
both the CIP and Accumulated Surplus (Deficit) accounts were overstated by the same 
amount, summarized as follows:

1.29 Considering that these projects were already completed in the previous years, it is 

appropriate to properly turn over and transfer the recording of the said completed 
projects to the recipient agencies and/or end-users.  
 

1.30 In Region IV-B, the Marinduque and Mindoro Oriental DEOs already issued various 
JEVs in CY 2021 to derecognize the completed projects and turn over to end-
user/recipient agencies totaling to P481,658,400.41.  

 
iv. Erroneous/Non-provision of depreciation – P323.094 million 

 
1.31 Paragraph 71 of IPSAS 17 further provides that, “Depreciation of an asset begins 

when it is available for use, i.e., when it is in the location and condition necessary for 
it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by Management.” 
 

1.32 Item k of Section 27, Chapter 10, Volume 1 of the GAM for NGAs provides the proper 
computation of monthly depreciation expense of the PPE. 
 

1.33 Records showed that the following DPWH offices erroneously/failed to provide the 
appropriate amount of depreciation for their respective PPE account resulting in net 
understatement of both PPE and net overstatement of Depreciation Expense  accounts 
by the same amount of P323,093,931.50, broken down as follows:

Net Understatement  323,093,931.50 

 
1.34 The same observation has been reported in prior years’ Audit Reports whereby it was 

noted that the accounting error was mostly caused by the non-recording of depreciation 
of PPE for one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month.  
 

1.35 Since there is already a system-generated depreciation, monitoring of the accuracy and 
correctness of depreciation is still necessary to ascertain whether the amounts 
recognized as depreciation expense are properly recorded in accordance with the said 
GAM. 

 
v. Major repairs and improvements of infrastructure assets and buildings not 

capitalized – P25.482 million 
 
1.36 Section 25, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides, among others, that 

an entity shall capitalize the costs incurred for repair, betterment, enhancement, 
expansion or upgrade of existing PPE if the amount is material and where the 
expenditure results in an effective increase in the future economic benefits or service 
potential that is expected to be derived from using the asset and the increase in future 
economic benefits or service potential will be realized;  there has been an effective 
increase in the quality of the services provided by the asset beyond that was previously 
determined; or  there has been an effective extension to the asset’s useful life as a result 
of the expenditure. 
 

1.37 The cost of the following major repairs and improvements of buildings and other PPE 
items totaling P25,482,466.10 were not capitalized but instead recorded as expenses 
contrary to Section 25, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, which 
understated the PPE account by the same amount:

1.38 The DPWH offices concerned in CAR already issued various JEVs in CY 2021 

totaling P15,646,789.05 to correct the erroneous recording of repair and improvements 
of PPE items. 

 
vi. Expenses charged against Engineering and Administrative Overhead 

erroneously recorded to CIP account – P73.573 million 
 
1.39 Section 11 of the Special Provisions for the DPWH General Appropriations (GAA) of 

FY 2020 provides for the treatment of EAO expenses, to wit: 
 

“Project-Related Expenses. For infrastructure projects costing One 
Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00), the DPWH is authorized to deduct, but 
not to exceed the following percentages of the project civil works cost, to 
be used for: (i) engineering and administrative overhead (EAO) 
expenses or (ii) Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses; 

 
(a) three and one-half percent (3.5%) for releases to the Central 

Office; 
(b) two and one-half percent (2.5%) for releases to the Regional 

Offices (ROs); 
(c) two percent (2%) for releases to the District Engineering Offices 

(DEOs); 
(d) one percent (1%) for infrastructure projects under the Local 

Infrastructure Program undertaken by the Central Office, ROs or 
DEOs; PROVIDED, that the 1% EAO shall be given only to the 
implementing unit, regardless where the funds was released; and 

(e) one-half percent (0.5%) for infrastructure projects of other 
agencies undertaken by the Central Office, ROs or DEOs. 

  
For EAO expenses, the same shall be limited to: (i) administrative 
overhead including the hiring of individuals engaged through job-orders 
or contracts of service or such other engagement of personnel without any 
employer-employee relationship; (ii) pre-construction activities after 
detailed engineering; (iii) construction project management; (iv) testing 
quality control; (v) acquisition, rehabilitation and repair of related 
equipment and parts; and (vi) contingencies in relation to pre-
construction activities. The EAO expenses shall be booked-up as 
capitalized expenditure and form part of the project cost.” 

 



113 
 

1.40 Review and analysis of the SL accounts balances revealed that various expenses by 
DPWH offices charged against EAO funds, such as payment of utilities, security 
services, janitorial services, training expenses and travel expenses, among others, 
totaling P73,573,216.58 were capitalized and recorded under CIP-Infrastructure 
Assets (IA) account despite their non-inclusion among the types of expenses that 
should be capitalized under the above-cited provision of GAA FY 2020. These were 
erroneously added to the cost of the projects, summarized as follows: 

 
                                                      Table 10 -   Expenses Charged to EAO

Catanduanes DEO 1,842,502.54 

Total 73,573,216.58 

 
1.41 These EAO expenses shall not be capitalized since these are considered as 

Maintenance and Other Operating Expense (MOOE) and should have been recognized 
as outright expenses. 
 

1.42 The above-cited misclassification of accounts in recording of expenditures charged to 
EAO funds resulted in overstatement of CIP accounts and understatement of the 
corresponding expense accounts by the same amount of P73,573,216.58, thereby 
affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements. 
 

1.43 In DPWH OSEC and Catanduanes DEO, the capitalized expenses amounting to 
P51,859,057.87 and P1,842,502.54, respectively, were already adjusted in CY 2021 
under JEV Nos. 2021-05-008091, 2021-05-008097 and 2021-06-001909. 

 
vii. Misclassification of Semi-Expendable Equipment as PPE – P5.706 million 

 
1.44 Section 3, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides, among others, that 

the cost of an item of PPE shall be recognized as asset if it meets the capitalization 
threshold of P15,000.00. 
 

1.45 The following various tangible items with costs falling below the capitalization 
threshold of P15,000.00 were classified under PPE account resulting in the 
overstatement thereof by the total amount of P5,705,627.42:

1.48 We recommended that Management direct the: 
 

a) respective Accountants of the DPWH offices concerned to: 
 

 recognize in the books the unrecorded purchases of various 
equipment, donated vehicles and transferred vehicles from different 

sources; and the unbilled portion of the completed projects, in 

accordance with Sections 7, 8 and 14, Chapter 10, Volume I of the 

GAM for NGAs; 



115 
 

 drop from the books of accounts the book value of infrastructure 
assets, buildings and other structures transferred/in possession of 

various agencies and furnish the recipient agencies/end-users a copy 

of the JEV as basis for recording them in their books of accounts; 

 

 compute the proper depreciation of completed projects reclassified to 
appropriate asset account from the time these projects were finished 

up to the present, as well as, for other PPEs;  

 

 capitalize expenses incurred for the major repair and improvement of 
infrastructure assets and buildings in accordance with Section 25, 

Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs; 

 

 adjust the improper recording of expenditures charged to EAO 
allocation to ensure proper classification of expenditures; 

 

 adjust misclassified semi-expendable equipment and other PPEs to 
appropriate account in accordance with Section 3, Chapter 10, 

Volume I of the GAM for NGAs; and 

 

 make the necessary adjusting entries for double recording of acquired 
MV and CHE, and for other errors noted in recording the PPEs; 

 

b) implementing Offices to submit necessary documentary requirements for 
completed projects to the Accounting Division and facilitate the 

transfer/turn-over of the completed buildings and other structures to the 

respective recipient agencies and/or end-users; and 

 

c) contractors concerned to file the necessary final billing to the Accounting 
Division to fully settle their claims for the completed projects; otherwise, 

outstanding unliquidated accounts payable for two (2) years or more shall 

be reverted to unappropriated surplus of the general fund pursuant to 

Section 98 of PD No. 1445. 

 

d. Net Understatement of Payables account – P1.569 billion 
 
1.49 The balance of Accounts Payable (AP) account as of December 31, 2020, is net 

understated by P1,569,453,862.16 due to errors and omissions as discussed in the next 
paragraphs: 

 
i. Non-reversion of long outstanding Accounts Payable – P389.877 million 

 
1.50 Section 98 of PD No. 1445 provides, among others, that any unliquidated balance of 

Accounts Payable in the books of the National Government which has been 
outstanding for two (2) years or more and against which no actual claim, administrative 
or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by perfected contracts or records 



116 
 

should be reverted to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund of the national 
government. Corollary to this is EO No. 109 dated June 10, 1999 as implemented by 
COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 99-06 dated November 13, 1999, which requires the 
reversion, among others, of all undocumented payables and unliquidated obligations, 
irrespective of age. 
 

1.51 Further, EO No. 87 issued on August 13, 2019, directing that all accounts payables 
which remain outstanding for two (2) years or more in the books of the national 
government agencies be reverted to the accumulated surplus or deficit of the general 
fund, or the cumulative result of operations of the national government. 
 

1.52 Audit and review of the SLs of the Accounts Payable account revealed that 
unsupported and past due payables without valid and actual claims, amounting to 
P389,876,894.34 or 1.26 percent of the total reported Accounts Payable balance of 
P30,952,387,779.00, have been outstanding for more than two (2) years and not 
reverted, as required under COA-DBM Circular No. 99-06 dated November 13, 1999 
and PD No. 1445, with details shown in Table 14:

1.53 The same observation was noted in the previous years’ audit. It is noteworthy to 
mention that the Management of DPWH OSEC partially complied with the previous 
year’s audit recommendation, of which 75 percent or P155,211,481.37 out of the 
P207,832,506.84 Accounts Payable as of December 31, 2019, under Fund Cluster 01, 
aged two (2) years over were reverted during the year.  
 

1.54 The unreverted amounts pertained to obligations set-up by the Management with no 
valid claims filed and which are not supported by documents nor SLs or schedules to 
substantiate the obligations and are carried in the books for more than two (2) years as 
of December 31, 2020. Hence, should be reverted to Accumulated Surplus (Deficit) 
account pursuance with Section 98 of PD No. 1445, and EO No. 87 dated August 13, 
2019. 
 

1.55 The existence of these long outstanding payables with no valid claimants/creditors 
and/or supporting documents to establish the validity of the obligations by the DPWH 
overstated the reported balances of AP and Accumulated Surplus(Deficit) by the same 
amount of P389,876,894.34. 
 

1.56 We recommended that Management instruct the Accountants to revert to the 
BTr the balances which are outstanding for two (2) years or more and those 

undocumented and without valid/actual claimants, pursuant to Section 98 of PD 

No. 1445 and EO No. 87 issued on August 13, 2019

information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.” 

 
 “The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall observe in 

the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading

1.60 We recommended that Management direct the respective Accountants of the 

DPWH offices concerned to draw the necessary JEVs to: 
 

a) record the accrued expenses/liabilities relating to CY 2020 which were 
recorded in CY 2021; and 

 

b) correct the balances of the affected accounts reported in the financial 
statements. 

 



119 
 

1.61 In compliance with the audit recommendation, Management of La Union 2nd DEO has 
committed to prepare entries to correct the identified deficiencies accordingly.  

 
e. Understatement of Inter-Agency Payable account – P0.365 million 

 
1.62 Audit and verification of the remittances made to GSIS disclosed that various checks 

issued to GSIS, with a total amount of P364,508.76 in DPWH OSEC under Fund 
Cluster 01, were already recorded and debited in the books of accounts but cancelled, 
hence, understating the reported balance of account Due to GSIS by the same amount, 
details of which are shown in Table 16:

Total 364,508.76 

 
1.63 The checks were cancelled because the said remittances were not completely 

processed due to clarificatory items that surfaced in the Electronic Remittance File 
(ERF) submission to GSIS. The payment of premium contributions will not be 
processed by GSIS in case of discrepancies (i.e.,unmatched name, clarificatory items) 
identified by the GSIS in its validation of the remitting agency’s ERF against the GSIS 
database.  Consequently, the Department has the responsibility to re-upload the ERF 
cleared from clarificatory items and reconcile exception reports with unmatched items 
to be able to succeed in processing the remittance of premium contributions. 
 

1.64 We recommended that Management instruct the Chief Accountant to draw the 
JEVs to record the necessary adjustments to correct the balance of Due to GSIS 

account reported in the financial statements.  

 

1.65 In compliance with the audit recommendation, the OIC - Director of Finance Service 
requested the personnel concerned of the Human Resource and Administrative Service 
to replace the cancelled checks for the employees with no clarificatory items and be 
remitted at the soonest possible time. 

 
 

Accounting Deficiencies Affecting the Reliability of Account Balances 
 
Existence of unreconciled balances in the financial statements – P20.839 billion 
 
2. Eighteen (18) accounts with unreconciled balances in general ledgers remained 

existing in the Financial Statements of OSEC, Regions VIII and X as of December 

31, 2020 totaling P20,838,611,337.93 thus, affected the reliability and fair 

presentation of the reported balances of the asset and liability accounts. 



120 
 

2.1 Section 111 of PD No. 1445 provides that “The accounts of an agency shall be kept in 
such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be 
adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the 
government. The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be 
observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading 
information.”  
 

2.2 In addition, paragraph 27 of IPSAS 1 provides that “Financial Statements shall present 
fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair 
presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other 
events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for 
assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, 
with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial 
statements that achieve a fair presentation.” 
 

2.3 COA Circulars No. 97-001 and 2016-005 dated February 5, 1997 and December 19, 
2016, respectively, provide the guidelines and the procedures needed to be taken on 
existing dormant accounts of an agency: 

 
 Paragraph B-1 - Dormant accounts on active funds shall be reviewed, 

analyzed and reconciled together with the other related accounts in the trial 
balance. 

 
 Paragraph B-2 - After the review and validation of accounts, the procedures 

prescribed in Nos. III.A.3 to 4 and III.A.9 to 10 of this circular shall be 
followed. 

 
2.4 Despite previous years’ audit recommendations to conduct thorough analysis of the 

unreconciled balances, monitor the progress of the reconciliation of the accounts 
affected and make necessary adjustments, it was noted that as of December 31, 2020, 
the following accounts balances reported in the Statement of Financial Position, under 
Regular Agency Fund still showed unreconciled balances totaling P20,126,549,054.40 
for assets and P712,062,283.53 for liabilities, details are shown as follows:

2.5 Audit revealed that majority of the unreconciled accounts were due to balances 

forwarded as: (a) beginning balances in CY 2004 in the implementation of e-NGAs 
which remained dormant to-date; and (b) transfer of books of accounts of closed 
Project Monitoring Offices to Central Office recorded in CYs 2015 to 2016 wherein 
the supporting documents necessary for reconciliation of the forwarded balances could 
no longer be traced according to the Accounting Division personnel.  
 

2.6 It bears to note that under the DPWH Special Order No. 05, s. 2017 dated January 27, 
2017 which created a Composite Team responsible for the elimination of unreconciled 
balances in the subsidiary ledger balances in the books, a quarterly progress report on 
the reconciliation of accounts is required to be prepared by the said composite team 
every 10th day after the end of each quarter.  
 

2.7 This observation was the subject of Audit Observation Memoranda issued in prior 
years with recommendation that Management conduct thorough analysis of the 
unreconciled balances, monitor the progress of the reconciliation of the accounts 
affected and make necessary adjustments.  
 

2.8 The existence of unreconciled SL balances of various Subdiary Ledger accounts for 
16 years is still significant and casts doubts on the Management’s assertions on the 
accuracy and fair presentation of the Department’s Financial Statements contrary to 
Section 111 PD No. 1445 and paragraph 27 of IPSAS. 
 

2.9 We reiterated our recommendations that Management direct the Composite 
Team to continue the reconciliation and analysis of the long outstanding 

unreconciled balances and enforce the submission of their reports within the time 

frame, pursuant to DPWH Special Order No. 5, series of 2017; and if warranted, 

request for authority to write-off accounts that can no longer be accounted 



122 
 

following the procedures prescribed under COA Circular No. 97-001 dated 

February 5, 1997 and 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. 
 

2.10 DPWH OSEC Management commented that the Accounting Division has exerted 
efforts to reconcile such accounts. The team cannot find additional supporting 
documents to reconcile the accounts. 
 

2.11 In Region VIII, Management has already exhausted all efforts to eliminate all 
unreconciled balances even before the records were destroyed by the storm surge in 
2013. Appeal has been made for the write-off of the unreconciled balance. 

 
 
Other deficiencies in recording PPE 
 
3. The non-reclassification due to unsubmitted documents for the 25 units turned-

over motor vehicles from completed projects amounting to P36,342,484.80; and 

the unaccounted PPEs worth P367,804,499.76 affected the reliability and 

accuracy of the reported PPE account balances. 

 

a) Unrecorded turned-over motor vehicles from completed projects – P36.342 
million 

 
3.1 Further audit and verification of the SLs and reports submitted disclosed that 25 units 

of MVs amounting to P36,342,484.80 which were already turned-over from completed 
projects and being used as service vehicles by various officials and employees of the 
DPWH OSEC were not recorded under Motor Vehicles account but instead remained 
recorded under the CIP account, with details as follows:

Total 25 36,342,484.80 

 
3.2 These vehicles turned-over from completed projects are part of Engineering Facilities 

as pay items of the infrastructure contract which are initially recorded under the CIP 
account when delivered on site which are included in the claim of the contractor.  
Eventually, after completion of the project, the said vehicles will be turned-over to 
Bureau of Equipment (BOE) in pursuance with DO No. 165, series 2016, issued by 
the Department to standardize the turn-over process of motor vehicles and other pay 
items included in the contract.  Considering that the vehicles were already turned-over 



123 
 

and included in the inventory report of the Property Office, these should be transferred 
from the CIP account to the Motor Vehicles account. 
 

3.3 Based on the inquiry made to the Accounting personnel concerned, all the above-
mentioned vehicles were not taken-up in the books because the BOE did not submit 
the necessary supporting documents to facilitate the recording.  
 

3.4 In DPWH OSEC, the deficiencies were already corrected in CY 2021 under various 
JEVs amounting to P23,944,400.00 

 
b) Unaccounted PPEs – P367.804 million 

 
3.5 Further analysis of the account under Fund Cluster 01 disclosed that 385 units of PPE 

amounting to P367,804,499.76 were recorded in the books of accounts of DPWH but 
not included/reported in the RPCPPE, of which the physical existence and 
whereabouts of such equipment could not be located, summarized as follows:

3.6 We recommended and Management agreed to direct the: 

 

a) respective Accountants of the DPWH offices concerned to review/analyze 
in detail the PPE account to determine and establish the accuracy/validity 
of the recorded motor vehicles and equipment, particularly the identified 

non-existing and unaccounted vehicles/equipment, and secure 

documents/records from possible sources/offices to provide information 

and support the ownership, costing and existence; and 

 
b) Officials concerned of the Bureau of Equipment to: 

 

 submit the documents to the Accounting Division as basis for 
recording the motor vehicles acquired/transferred from completed 

projects; and 



124 
 

 

 look into the whereabouts of the unaccounted PPEs recorded in the 
SL but not recorded in the RPCPPE and gather the necessary 

documents as basis of identifying the equipment. 

 
3.7 We also recommended that Management instruct the Accounting Division and 

the Offices concerned of the Bureau of Equipment to regularly reconcile and 

make necessary adjustments/corrections in both the accounting and property 

records for the discrepancies noted in order to present the correct balances of the 

PPE accounts in the financial statements as of a given period. 

 
 
Existence of dormant/undocumented balances of several accounts – P879.811 million 
 
4. The existence of various dormant/undocumented account balances amounting to 

P879,811,228.80 casts doubts on the reliability and accuracy of the reported year-

end balances of the affected accounts. 
 
4.1 Several accounts disclosed that prior years’ balance includes a total amount of 

P879,811,228.80 which remained dormant for more than five (5) to more than 10 
years.

4.2 The said balances could not be ascertained because there are no available schedules 

and supporting documents to prove/show the accounts’ validity and details. These 
amounts remained undocumented for several years, casting doubts to the accuracy and 
reliability of the reported account balances. 
 

4.3 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) instruct the respective Accountants of the DPWH offices concerned to 
verify and validate the dormant accounts to any available source documents 



125 
 

and draw the necessary adjusting entry if it was a result of an accounting 

error, or if warranted, include in the request for write-off; and 

 

b) require the Chief Accountant and Human Resource and Administrative 
Service-Payroll Clerk to expedite the analysis, validation and reconciliation 

of prior years’ account balance which are long outstanding to avoid 

accumulation of unremitted contributions. 

 
4.4 Management commented the following:

VIII Samar 2nd 
DEO 

The Accounting Unit is currently working on the 
reconciliation/verification of available documents that could justify the 
correctness of the existing balances of Buildings and Other Structures 
accounts. The District Accountant also stated that these balances had been 
long included in the books of accounts of the District and has been carried 
over from the old NGAS to the current eNGAS. Management has 
committed to verify these accounts and draw the necessary adjusting 
entries to correct these balances, if needed. 

X RO LBP Account No. 2412-1008-00 consists of claims which was not 
honored by the bank upon payment due to garnishment order issued by the 
12th Judicial Regional Branch of Iligan. 
 
For LBP Account No. 3142101989, Management will remit the said 
amount to the Bureau of Treasury. 

XI RO Management informed the COA office in a letter dated February 3, 2021 
that a preliminary inquisition was made in relation to the filing of request 
for authority to write-off for the above-mentioned dormant account. 
However, the Auditor asked for the historical information of the account, 
which the office could no longer provide due to unavailability of books 
and records to support the filing of request. Though there were books 
retrieved from previous years, historical data of the account can no longer 
be traced since most of the data were forwarded balances and the books of 
accounts from 10 years ago can no longer be located or already in 
irreparable state. The documents submitted to support the said request 
were insufficient and seemed futile to substantiate the said account 
balance despite the efforts exerted by the management, hence, the 
intention to file the request for write-off could not push through to the 
COA Regional Office due to the foregoing circumstances.

Unreconciled differences between the books of DPWH OSEC and Implementing Agencies – 
P399.406 million 
 
5. The accuracy of the year-end balance of Inter-Agency Receivables account could 

not be determined due to unreconciled difference of P399,406,178.64 between the 

balances reported in the books of DPWH OSEC and Implementing Agencies 

(IAs).  

 
5.1 Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, 

provides that, “The accountant shall conduct regular and periodic verification, 
analysis, and validation of the existence of the receivables, unliquidated cash 
advances, and fund transfers, and determine the concerned debtors, accountable 
officers (Regular and Special Disbursing Officers, Collecting Officers, Cashiers) and 
the source and implementing government entities concerned. Reconcile the 
unliquidated fund transfers between the source and implementing government entities, 
prepare the adjusting entries for the reconciling items noted, and require liquidation 
of the balances.” 
 

5.2 Confirmation of the balances of funds transferred to various IAs revealed 
discrepancies or unreconciled difference totaling P399,406,178.64 in the recorded 
amounts of outstanding balances between the books of DPWH OSEC and IAs. Details

5.3 Based on the above table, there are balances confirmed by the recipient agencies that 

were already liquidated in the books of the IAs, not existing/received and could not be 
determined, thus affecting the reliability and accuracy of the reported balance of the 
Inter-Agency Receivables account.  



128 
 

5.4 The IAs find it hard to trace these balances in their records; hence, they are requesting 
for details or supporting documents that can enable them to validate, reconcile or 
liquidate such amounts. 
 

5.5 Moreover, due to the absence of liquidation reports from the IAs, the status of the 
projects for the long outstanding balances of funds transferred to the identified NGAs, 
Government Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs), LGUs and Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs)/ People’s Organizations (POs), as to whether 
projects are still ongoing, completed or discontinued could not be determined. 
 

5.6 We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations that Management direct the 
Chief Accountant to analyze discrepancies noted from confirmations with the IAs 

and reconcile/adjust accordingly. Also, make representation with the IAs 

concerned to investigate, verify and reconcile the records on those funds 

transferred but reported as not received by them and not existing in their books 

of accounts. 
 

5.7 Management commented that with community quarantine protocols in place due to the 
current pandemic, periodic monitoring and reconciliation had been more challenging 
since there is limited manpower working on files in the workplace. Nonetheless, in 
compliance with the above-stated recommendation, the Management will continue to 
send series of demand letters to these various NGAs, GOCCs, LGUs and NGO/PO 
which include among others, follow-ups and phone calls, in order to enforce 
immediate submission of liquidation reports and to facilitate refund of unexpended 
balances, particularly with NHA account which represents 77.7 percent of the total 
outstanding unliquidated funds transferred.  
 

5.8 Furthermore, inactive/dormant unliquidated fund transfers will be comprehensively 
reviewed, analyzed and evaluated to determine the whereabouts of these receivables   
and apply the necessary adjustments to fairly present the account in the books. 

 
 
COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 
Receipts and utilization of budget/allotments 
 
6. Of the total allotments received by various DPWH offices totaling to 

P127,454,691,696.27 for CY 2020, only P113,925,662,911.43 or 89.39 percent 

thereof was obligated while P58,022,497,813.32 or 50.93 percent was disbursed as 

of December 31, 2020, thus, utilization of their authorized budget and its 

programmed appropriations was not fully maximized contrary to Section 70 of 

the General Appropriations Act of RA No. 11465. 

 
6.1 The government budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 was promulgated through the 

enactment of Republic Act (RA) No. 11465, otherwise known as the General 
Appropriations Act (GAA) of FY 2020. Government budget is defined as the financial 



129 
 

plan of a government for a given period, usually for a fiscal year, which shows what 
its resources are, and how they will be generated and used over the fiscal period. The 
budget is the government's key instrument for promoting its socio-economic 
objectives. 
 

6.2 Section 70 of RA No. 11465 or the GAA of FY 2020 provides that, as a general rule, 
department, bureaus, and offices of the National Government, including Constitutional 
Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs shall spend what is programmed in their 
respective appropriations in the said Act. The National Budget Circular No. 578 
provides for the policies, procedures, rules and regulations on the release, utilization 
of funds, and monitoring of the FY 2020 Funds.  
 

6.3 Anent thereto, to promote budget efficiency, all government agencies should execute 
their programs, activities and projects (PAPs) and deliver planned results in a timely 
manner and determine the levels of performance in terms of physical outputs, as well 
as actual expenditures, vis-à-vis targets for the same period.  
 

6.4 Review of the obligations and disbursements for CY 2020 disclosed that programmed 
appropriations and allotments were not fully utilized/spent and the disbursement rates 
of 50.93 percent fell short of the total obligations as of December 31, 2020, to wit:

Percentage based on Obligations   50.93% 

 
6.5 It was noted that the low utilization rates above were attributed primarily with the 

following factors: 
 

 delay in the implementation and completion of projects within the specific 
contract time due to problems and unavoidable circumstances encountered 
during the construction of the projects; 

 late releases of allotments for projects; and 
 failure of the contractors concerned to timely submit requests for progress and 

final billings, together with the necessary documents or requirements, for the 
payment of work accomplished on the implementation of projects. 

 
6.6 Management explained that some factors contributing to low obligation and 

disbursements rates are as follows:  
 
 Request for the payment of VAT refund claims of the contractor was not submitted 

and processed due to the delay experienced by the project.  
 Delay in the procurement of consultancy and civil works contracts due to the 

imposition of community quarantines due to COVID-19. Further, Japanese 
Consultants supervising the projects were repatriated during the lockdowns. 

 Delays were encountered in the preparation of bidding plans, cost estimates 
undertaken by the Bureau of Design since they were understaffed and have limited 
design tools and software. In addition, the proposed design works were likewise 
required to be coordinated with the MMDA since operation and maintenance of 
the pumping station is under their jurisdiction 

 Delay on the part of lending institutions in the review/approval and concurrence of 
project documents. 

 Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in the suspension of works during 
imposed enhanced community quarantines and slow down of activities of the 
Contractors and Consultants leading to low output/work accomplishment. 



131 
 

 The implementation of targeted projects was delayed because of the numerous 
conditions beyond the control of the Management, this includes late issuance of 
approve Multi Year Contractual Authority (MYCA), authority to obligate 
multiyear contract, as required in the DPWH GAA for FY 2020, the Obligation 
and Notice to Proceed for MYCA projects was only funded in the later part of the 
last quarter. 

 
6.7 The low obligation of significant amount of allotments and dismal disbursement of 

funds for the PAPs of the above DPWH offices is reflective of the Management’s 
inability to maximize its authorized budgetary allocations as provided under the FY 
2020 GAA and casts doubts on its readiness and capacity to execute programs and 
projects. This state could result in delayed or non-implementation of projects to the 
detriment of its intended users. 
 

6.8 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) endeavor to maximize the use of the allotments received for the timely 
implementation of programs and projects in order to avoid 

expiration/accumulation of unobligated allotments; and 

 

b) require the contractors concerned to timely submit their claims for progress 
and final billings with complete documentary requirements; facilitate the 

completion of projects particularly those affected by the pandemic to fully 

maximize and improve the absorptive and spending capacity of the agency 

in terms of disbursements of allotments received; avoid any adverse effect 

on their future budget levels by initiating pre-procurement activities, 

facilitating the procurement process, conducting adequate planning and 

monitoring; and, adopt a complete and adequate procedures to implement 
the targets in order to be responsive to program realities and actual 

conditions. 

 
 

Utilization of cash allocations 
 
7. Of the total cash allocations received by various DPWH offices in CY 2020 

totaling to P49,380,077,194.59, P1,097,616,966.14 or 2.22 percent was not utilized 

resulting in its reversion to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr). 

 
7.1 Department of Budget and management (DBM) National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 

578 dated January 6, 2020, provides for the guidelines on the release of funds for fiscal 
year 2020. Section 3.6.3 of the said Circular states, among others, that “The Monthly 
Disbursement Program (MDP) or BED No. 3 shall serve as basis for the DBM’s 
release of disbursement authorities including the comprehensive Notice of Cash 
Allocation (NCA) as well through later tranches as may later be required to cover the 
cash requirements of the agency for its regular operating requirements.”  
 



132 
 

7.2 Further, DBM Circular Letter No. 2019-3 dated January 4, 2019 also provides for the 
guidelines covering the crediting and validity of NCA for Regular Modified 
Disbursement System (MDS) Sub-Accounts effective first quarter of FY 2019 and 
onwards, to wit: 

 
Par. 1.0 - To ensure the timely implementation of program and projects, 
disbursement authorization documents are issued to make cash available 
within the scheduled program/activity/project implementation period as 
reflected in the corresponding DBM- evaluated Monthly Disbursement 
Programs (MDPs) submitted by agencies. 

 
Par. 2.1 - All NCA releases for Regular MDS Sub-Accounts, to be 
credited for any month, whether part of the comprehensive releases or 
constituting additional NCA releases, shall continue to be valid until the 
last working day of the 3rd month of the quarter covered. (emphasis 
ours) 

 
7.3 Audit disclosed that of the total NCAs/ Notice of Transfer Allocations (NTAs) totaling 

P49,380,077,194.59, received by various DPWH offices in NCR, Regions III, IV-A, 
IX and XII for their regular operating expenditures allocated in their MDPs for the 1st 
to 4th quarters of CY 2020, the amount of P1,097,616,966.14 was not utilized and 
therefore reverted to the National Treasury. Details are shown  in Table 23:

7.4 The releases of NCAs from DBM and NTAs from DPWH OSEC were intended and 

utilized for the implementation of various infrastructure projects and other programs, 
activities and projects that were embodied in the GAA for FY 2020. 
 

7.5 As gleaned from the above table, the DPWH offices had not fully utilized the 
NCAs/NTAs made available to them by the DBM/DPWH OSEC during the year. This 
signified lapses in planning/programming and unrealistic forecast of cash 
requirements. The same observation has been noted and discussed in prior years Audit 
Report. 
 

7.6 We recommended that the DPWH offices concerned improve the preparation of 
their MDPs taking into consideration their historical records/experience to be 

able to come up with realistic forecasting of cash requirements for the period and 

attainable MDPs. 
 

7.7 We also recommended that the DPWH offices concerned adopt strategies that 
will: 

 

a) fast track the procurement evaluation procedures, activities, and processes 
in order to implement and complete the projects on time and within 

schedule to maximize the utilization of cash allocations and provide full 

benefits as intended; and 

 

b) use cash allocations judiciously and diligently to avoid reversion of 
unutilized cash allocation.

Reverted cash was beyond Management’s control, NCA/NTA received were fully 
utilized but the ADA issued amounting to 108M was not credited to the account of 
the contractors on time due to system error that the bank has experienced which 
resulted to reversion of cash.  While the other amount of 3M is due to pandemic 
situation wherein checks issued for RROW claimant remains unclaimed and checks 
intended for GSIS, HDMF remittances became stale due to lockdown.

The bulk of reverted amount of P72,841,622.10 was due to late submission of

In compliance with the audit findings, the Management has directed the Finance 
Section to coordinate closely with the Implementing Section/s through 
Memorandum and other applicable forms of communication to fast track the 
submission of billings with complete supporting documents and to avoid the 
lapsing of NCA/NTA.

8. Interest from various bank deposits, unutilized collections from sale of bid 

documents/seminar fees and dormant/idle cash in bank accounts totaling to 

P94,373,927.37 were not remitted to the BTr as required by existing regulations, 

thereby depriving the national government of much needed funds and exposing 

funds to possible misuse. 

 
8.1 Audit of Trust Receipts and Cash in Bank- Local Currency, Current Account disclosed 

that interest income, unutilized collections from sale of bid documents, seminar fees 
and dormant/idle cash in bank accounts totaling P94,373,927.37 were not remitted to 
the BTr as of December 30, 2020, breakdown as follows:

8.2 Section 65 of PD No. 1445 states that, “Unless otherwise specifically provided by law, 

income accruing to the agencies by virtue of the provisions of law, orders and 
regulations shall be deposited in the National Treasury  or in any duly authorized 
government depository, and shall accrue to the unappropriated surplus of the General 
Fund of the Government.” 
 

8.3 Moreover, Section 5.3.2 of the amended Department of Finance (DOF) Circular No. 
01-2017 dated May 11, 2017 states that, “all interest income earned by deposits of 
NGAs/GOCCs shall be remitted quarterly to the National Treasury, unless expressly 
provided by law that interest earnings of the account shall accrue to the fund for which 
the account was opened or maintained. The NGA/GOCC shall furnish the bank a copy 
of the certification of the exemption from automatic remittance of interest income, 
which may be granted by the BTr/DOF upon confirmation of the legal basis submitted 
by the NGA/GOCC.”  
 

8.4 Review of the SLs of the Cash in Bank account revealed that interests earned from 
bank deposits amounting to P1,738,101.46 remained unremitted to the BTr as of

depository of the Government and shall accrue to the unappropriated surplus of the 
General Fund of the Government: Provided, That amounts received in trust and from 
the business-type activities of government may be separately recorded and be 
disbursed in accordance with such rules and regulations as may be determined by the 
Permanent Committee created under this Act.”

8.7 EO No. 338 dated May 17, 1996, requires all government offices and agencies, unless 
otherwise specifically provided by law, to immediately transfer all monies in all 
government depository banks and institutions to the National Treasury, regardless of 
income source. If circumstances warrant, criminal and administrative sanction shall be 
meted out to responsible official/s and employee/s should they fail to comply with the 
requirement. 
 

8.8 EO No. 431 dated May 30, 2005 requires the reversion of all dormant accounts, 
unnecessary special and trust funds to the general fund and for other purposes to 
augment the depleting funds of the National Government, which otherwise would be 
borrowed/loaned from outside sources, and greatly ease current fiscal pressures and 
facilitate the implementation of programs and projects. 
 

8.9 Further audit also disclosed that three (3) bank accounts maintained by the DPWH 
OSEC under Fund Cluster 02 with account balance totaling to P80,157,831.75, 
intended for payment of road right-of-way (RROW) under expropriation cases from 
various projects have remained dormant, idle and unused for more than five (5) years.

8.10 Examination of the SLs of the above-listed accounts from CYs 2015 to 2020 revealed 

that the only movement in the accounts pertains only to collection and remittance of 
interest and bank charges.  
 

8.11 The same observations have been noted and reported in prior year’s Audit Report but 
the said accounts were still not closed and reverted to the BTr as of Report date.  
 

8.12 The non-remittance of the interest income, unutilized collections from sale of bid 
documents/seminar fees and dormant/idle cash in bank accounts totaling to 
P94,373,927.37 is contrary to the above-cited regulations and ultimately deprived the 
national government of additional funds that could be used to finance other priority 
programs/projects and exposing funds to possible misuse. 
 

8.13 We recommended that Management direct the Chief Accountant to: 
 

a) immediately remit to the BTr the interest earned from bank deposits and 
unutilized collections from sale of bid documents/seminar fees totaling 

P14,216,095.62; and 

 

b) constantly monitor and immediately close the dormant and idle cash in 
bank accounts and remit the balance to the BTr. 

 
8.14 The Chief Accountant of DPWH OSEC informed the Audit Team that interests 

amounting to P11,902.04 and P1,517,595.07 for Fund Clusters 02 and 04, respectively, 
were remitted to BTr per JEV-2021-02-000231, JEV-2021-02-000006 and JEV-2021-
03-000012, all dated March 31, 2021. 

 
 
Unliquidated fund transfers for one (1) to more than five (5) years – P8.962 billion 
  
9. Funds transferred for the implementation of the DPWH funded 

programs/projects in the total amount of P8,961,990,749.61 remained 

unliquidated for one (1) to more than five (5) years due to laxity of the DPWH 

offices in enforcing the provisions of COA Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2007-001 

dated December 13, 1994 and October 25, 2007, respectively. Moreover, the 

unliquidated balances include P126,419,557.57 that pertained to 

abolished/untraced implementing agencies and fund transfers relating to closed 

loans of P36,525,063.71. 
 



137 
 

9.1 COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 prescribes the rules and 
regulations on the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to the 
Implementing Agencies (IA) provides, among others, that the Source Agency should 
require the former to submit reports pertaining to the utilization of the cash transferred 
for a particular project.  
 

9.2 Likewise, paragraph 4.6 of the same circular states that within 10 days after the end of 
each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of 
Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of 
the funds. Only actual project expenses shall be reported. The reports shall be approved 
by the Head of the IA. 
 

9.3 Section 5.4 of COA Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007 provides that 
within 60 days after the completion of the project, the NGO/PO shall submit the final 
Fund Utilization Report certified by its Accountant and approved by its 
President/Chairman to the Government Organization (GO), together with the 
inspection report and certificate of project completion rendered/issued by the GO 
authorized representative, list of beneficiaries with their acceptance/acknowledgment 
of the project/funds/goods/services received.  
 

9.4 The Inter-Agency Receivables account of the DPWH with a year-end balance of 
P10,272,464,007.00 still showed prior years’ funds transferred totaling to 
P8,961,990,749.61 which remained unliquidated/unsettled for one (1) year to more 
than five (5) years, details shown in Table 28:

9.5 The afore-cited transferred funds to various NGAs, GOCCs, LGUs, and NGOs/POs 

remained outstanding due to inability of Management to require the IAs to liquidate 
the fund transfers within the prescribed period, laxity of enforcing the provision of 
COA Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2007-001 dated December 13, 1994 and October 25, 
2007, respectively, and lack of monitoring of the status of transferred funds by DPWH. 
 

9.6 It was further noted that the prior years’ account balances in DPWH OSEC, Fund 
Cluster 01, include accounts with the National Housing Authority (NHA) totaling 
P803,593,440.39 which has been outstanding since 2015 to 2017, consisting of the 
following:

9.7 As shown above, only P792,048,098.84 of the prior years’ funds transferred of 

P1,595,641,539.23 were liquidated as of December 31, 2020. Confirmation of the 
accounts and validation of project implementation by the DPWH disproved the 
likelihood of huge amount of unliquidated balance. Based on the validation of the 
projects implemented by the DPWH, particularly, the construction of Harbor Link 
Project, Segment 10, Phase 2 MNE, in the cities of Caloocan, Malabon, and 
Valenzuela, where the Informal Settlers Families (ISFs) were affected, disclosed that 
these are already completed and utilized since 2019. Thus, it is presumed that the NHA 
had cleared all the informal structures with the affected ISFs already relocated and the 
intended purpose of the funds already served.  The same observation was already noted 
and discussed in prior year’s Audit Report but still subsists, as the account balance 
was not yet fully liquidated, hence, this reiteration.  
 

9.8 Further verification and analysis of SLs also revealed that the prior years’ long 
outstanding balance of Inter-Agency Receivables account includes amounts pertaining 
to the following: 

 
a) Abolished/untraced implementing agencies- P126.419 million 

 
9.9 Based on the submitted report relative to the status of unliquidated funds transferred, 

six (6) Agencies with long outstanding balances of funds transferred in the DPWH 
OSEC, under Fund Cluster 01 amounting to P126,419,557.57 can no longer be traced 
or were already abolished, such as:

9.10 Review of the Report on Unliquidated Fund Transfers for CY 2020 submitted by 

Management for Fund Custer 02 of DPWH OSEC disclosed that several dormant 
unliquidated balances amounting to P36,525,063.71 refer to closed loans, and 
completed projects for which the funds were transferred. Details are as follows:

9.11 The above-cited funds of closed loans were transferred to various LGUs before 2004 
for the implementation of construction of water supply facilities and for the conduct 
of Municipal Water and Sanitation Team (WATSAN) Training and the 
formation/organization and conduct of BWSA Skills Training under ADB Loan No. 



141 
 

1440/1441-PHI (SF) - closed loan. The actual closing date of Rural Water Supply and 
Sanitation Sector Project (RW3SP) funded under Loan No. 1440 was on July 08, 2004 
and Loan No. 1441 was on July 23, 2004, with the final disbursement date on May 26, 
2004. 
 

9.12 This observation has been the subject of prior year’s Audit Report, however, 
Management is yet to reconcile the accounts and ensure that proper balances are 
recorded before transferring the unliquidated balances relating to closed loans to the 
Regular Agency Fund. 
 

9.13 We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations and Management agreed to 
direct the concerned Accounting personnel to: 
 

a) conduct periodic monitoring, analysis and reconciliation of the funds 
transferred between the books of the DPWH and the recipient agencies, 

especially those old and closed loans, as well as those whose whereabouts 

could not be determined; and 

 

b) continuously send demand/follow-up letters to the concerned IAs to enforce 
the liquidation of funds transferred and immediate refund of unutilized 

balance, particularly to NHA account considering that the DPWH project 

that affected the ISFs were already completed. 

 

9.14 We also recommended that Management direct the respective Chief Accountants 
of the DPWH offices concerned to conduct a comprehensive review, analysis and 

evaluation of the inactive and non-moving accounts and subsequently submit 

request for write-off in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated 

December 19, 2016. 

 
 
Unrecouped advances to contractors - P681.952 million 
 

10. Advance payments amounting to P681,951,728.01 were not recouped from the 
contractors, whose projects were already completed, rescinded, or terminated as 

of December 31, 2020 contrary to paragraph 4.3 of “Annex E” of RA No. 9184 

and its Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR), which resulted in 

the loss of government funds. 

 

10.1 Pertinent provisions of Annex E of RA No. 9184 and its RIRR provides that:  
 

Section 4.2 - “The advance payment shall be made only upon the 
submission to and acceptance by the procuring entity of an irrevocable 
credit of equivalent value from the commercial bank, a bank guarantee or 
a surety bond callable upon demand, issued by a surety or insurance 
company duly licensed by the Insurance Commission and confirmed by the 
procuring entity. 



142 
 

Section 4.3 - “The advance payment shall be repaid by the contractor by 
deducting fifteen percent (15%) from his periodic progress payments a 
percentage equal to the percentage of the total contract price used for the 
advance payment.” 

 
10.2 The reported balance of Advances to Contractors account amounting to 

P47,198,375,345.00 as of December 31, 2020, included unrecouped balances totaling 
P681,951,728.01 for 414 infrastructure projects that were already completed, 
rescinded or terminated, to wit:

10.3 According to the personnel concerned of the DPWH offices, one of the reasons for the 

non-recoupment of advance payments made to contractors was the late/non-
submission of final billings with the corresponding required documents by the 
contractors concerned despite written/verbal requests from Management.  
 

10.4 As to terminated or rescinded contracts, it was noted that the surety bond posted by 
the contractors concerned for the advance payment failed to forfeit during their default 
and upon termination of their contracts due to the absence of a committee or assigned 
DPWH officials who are responsible in forfeiting the said surety bond. 
 

10.5 The same audit observation was already noted in prior years’ audit reports, however, 
Management was not able to fully address and resolve the issue, hence, this 
observation. 
 

10.6 The DPWH Management could have enforced the contractors concerned to return the 
advance payments and the said funds could have been utilized to finance other priority 
projects of the government. Further, failure to recoup the advances made to defaulted 
contractors or forfeit the performance securities posted by them will result in the 
potential loss of government resources and may warrant the issuance of Notice/s of 
Disallowance.   
 

10.7 Moreover, audit also disclosed of unrecouped balances aggregating to P77,837,449.15 
which had been outstanding for more than 10 years. Common reason was that the 
account balance was not supported with documents/details, records or any available 
information to establish its accuracy and validity, the whereabouts of the contractors 
concerned and/or their businesses were no longer existing or could not be located, and 
the transactions were incurred long time ago. Breakdown of the total amount of 
dormant Advances to Contractors account is as follows:

10.8 We reiterated the following previous year’s recommendations that Management:    
 

a) demand for the immediate refund of the unrecouped advances or forfeit the 
corresponding irrevocable standby letters of credit or guarantee payment 

bonds posted by the contractors.  Other remedial measures/actions to 

collect the unrecouped amounts should be undertaken, such as coordination 

with the contractors and other DPWH offices to deduct the amount from 

any unpaid claims and from other projects undertaken by the same 

contractors, otherwise a Notice of Disallowances will be issued, if 

warranted; 

 

b) initiate legal action to those who refuse to refund the unrecouped advances, 
if warranted. Henceforth, the Agency officials should strictly comply with 

the provisions of existing issuances regarding the recoupment of advance 

payments made to the contractors;  

 

c) require the Office or personnel concerned to facilitate the issuance of 
Certificates of Completion on completed projects, submit the same to the 

Accounting Division of the implementing Offices concerned in order to 

recognize the amount of payables to the contractors, as well as, to record 

the recoupment of advances to contractors; and 

 

d) strictly comply with paragraph 4.3 of Annex E of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 
and impose administrative sanctions against erring personnel who failed to 

recoup the advances from the progress billings and/or surety bond of the 

contractors concerned, as warranted. 

 

10.9 We also recommended that Management: 
 

a) consider the creation of a new committee who will be responsible for the 
collection of the money value of forfeited performance/surety bonds and 

recoupment of outstanding balance of advance payments for all terminated 

and rescinded contracts, considering that the members of the Special Action 

Committee created under DO No. 282, series of 2003, dated October 29, 

2003 are no longer connected with the DPWH; and 

 

b) exert extra efforts to locate the pertinent documents and establish the 
correctness and accuracy of the long outstanding balances, and issue 

demand letters requiring them to return the unrecouped advances. 

 

10.10 Management submitted their comments regarding the audit observation and explained 
the following:

The unrecouped amount from the completed project under the contract was recouped in 
the final billing of the Contractor, which was submitted on February 10, 2020.  The 
Disbursement Voucher was returned by the Accounting Division due to insufficient 
supporting documents. As of date, the contractor is still in the process of complying with 
the needed documents.

The Management has directed the Chief of the Construction Section to submit the 
Certificates of Completion on completed projects to the Accounting Section as the basis 
of the latter to recognize the payables to the contractors, net of advances to be fully 
recouped. As a result, the former has submitted the Certificates of Completion of the 
identified completed projects to the Accounting Section. 
 
Upon checking of the Subsidiary Ledger of Advances to Contractors account, it was 
noted that the total amount of P2,024,339.16 as at December 31, 2020 has already been 
fully recouped.

The Management will monitor compliance with the recommendations. Out of 16 
unrecouped advance payments to contractors, 9 were already recouped while 2 were 
partially recouped, and the remaining 5 are expected to be recouped this year. 
 
Management is already coordinating with the concerned contractors on the matter 
concerning their final billings. It has also issued correspondence to the contractors 
whose projects were already terminated reiterating the request for the settlement of the 
balance due from them. 
 

 
10.11 The other DPWH offices concerned complied with the audit recommendations and the 

balance of advance payments were already recouped. 
 

 
Unreleased and unclaimed retention money – P827.476 million 
 

11. Significant amount of retention money totaling P827,475,763.01 from the 
progress billings of various contractors concerned remained unreleased and 

unclaimed for over two (2) years despite completion of the related projects but 

were not reverted to the unappropriated surplus in the General Fund, contrary 

to Section 98 of PD No. 1445 and EO No. 109 dated June 10, 1999. 

 



146 
 

11.1 Section 98 of the PD No. 1445 provides, among others, that any unliquidated balance 
of Accounts Payable in the books of the National Government which has been 
outstanding for two (2) years or above and against which no actual claim, 
administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by perfected contracts 
or records should be reverted to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund of the 
national government. Corollary to this is EO No. 109 dated June 10, 1999 as 
implemented by COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 99-06 dated November 13, 1999, 
which requires the reversion, among others, of all undocumented payables and 
unliquidated obligations, irrespective of age. 
 

11.2 Section 6, Annex E of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 states that, “Progress payments are 
subject to retention of ten percent (10%) referred to as the "retention money." Such 
retention shall be based on the total amount due to the contractor prior to any 
deduction and shall be retained from every progress payment until fifty percent (50%) 
of the value of works, as determined by the procuring entity, are completed. If, after 
fifty percent (50%) completion, the work is satisfactorily done and on schedule, no 
additional retention shall be made; otherwise, the ten percent (10%) retention shall 
be imposed. Likewise, the total "retention money" shall be due for release upon final 
acceptance of the works. Xxxx 
 

11.3 Analysis of the Aging of Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable account as of December 
31, 2020 disclosed that the year-end balance of P275,109,952.00 includes a significant 
amount of retention money amounting to P827,475,763.01 which remained unreleased 
and outstanding for over two (2) years or more but not yet reverted to the BTr as 
required. Breakdown is shown in Table 34:

11.4 Considering that the Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable account balance of 

P827,475,763.01 has been outstanding for more than two (2) years and not supported 
with actual valid claims filed by the contractors for the release thereof, the said balance 
may be reverted to the unappropriated surplus in the General Fund, pursuant to Section 
98 of PD No. 1445. The same observation was also noted in the previous year’s audit. 
 

11.5 The Management of DPWH OSEC partially complied with the previous year’s audit 
recommendation, of which  P47,209,556.59 or 92 percent  of the P51,293,701.17 



148 
 

unreleased retention money under Fund Cluster 01  and 19 out of 37 projects aged two 
(2) years over were either reverted, refunded or adjusted as of December 31, 2020.  

 
11.6 Applying the above-discussed provisions of law to the facts, review and analysis of 

the account disclosed that said claims should be derecognized pursuant to Section 17, 
Chapter 7, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs which clearly provides that “An entity 
shall remove a financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) from its statement 
of financial position when, and only when, it is extinguished, that is, when the 
obligation specified in the contract is discharged, waived, or cancelled, or expires.”  
 

11.7 Finally, the Management should ensure that the accounts related to the retention 
money must be properly aged and monitored to determine the accounts that should be 
derecognized pursuant to applicable laws, rules and the said GAM. Derecognition of 
the prescribed claims relative to retention money is also a practical measure to prevent 
erroneous payment of claims that has already prescribed.  
 

11.8 We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations that Management direct the 
Accountants concerned to forfeit the retention money and revert the amount to 

Accumulated Surplus (Deficits), pursuant to Section 98 of PD No. 1445. Further, 

derecognize this account in the books of the DPWH in pursuance with Section 17, 

Chapter 7, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. 
 

11.9 In the letter dated March 15, 2021 of the OIC-Director, Finance Service, DPWH 
OSEC, Management has cited the following comments/justifications in reference to 
the above-cited observations: 

 
 An amount of P3,410,508.32 was already claimed under DV-101-21-03-

01870 dated March 5, 2021. 
 Based on our record, the contractors/consultants’ projects with a total 

amount of P37,302,968.79 was not yet claimed since the said projects is 
still ongoing. 

 A total amount of P1,558,545.52 were already reverted under JEV-2021-
03-004364 dated March 15, 2021. 

 An aggregate amount of P10,882,768.61, which should have been 
classified under Fund 102 under Foreign Assisted Projects (FAPS) and 
Inventory and Assets Section (IAS), will be addressed separately. 

 

 

Unsettled Disallowances and uncollected Receivables – P198.681 million 
 
12. Disallowances and Other Receivables amounting to P197,747,010.62 and 

P934,099.76, respectively, remained outstanding in the books of different DPWH 

offices for four (4) years to more than 20 years due to failure of the Management 

to enforce settlement of claims contrary to Section 7.1.1 of the 2009 COA Rules 

and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) and Sections 7.1 and 7.2 

of COA Circular No. 2016-005. 



149 
 

 
a) Unsettled Disallowances – P197.747 million 

 
12.1 Section 7.1.1 of the 2009 COA RRSA states that, “The head of the agency, who is 

primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, 
shall ensure that: (a) the required financial and other reports and statements are 
submitted by the concerned agency officials in such form and within the period 
prescribed by the Commission; (b) the settlement of disallowances and charges is 
made within the prescribed period; (c) the requirements of transactions suspended in 
audit are complied with; and (d) appropriate actions are taken on the deficiencies 
noted as contained in the AOM.”

12.3 It bears to note that the responsibility over the settlement of disallowances within the 
prescribed period rests with the Agency Head pursuant to Section 7.1.1 of the RRSA. 
 

12.4 The amount of unsettled disallowances has deprived the Government in the use of the 
money to fund other priority projects.  

 
b) Uncollected Receivables aged four (4) to more than five (5) years – P934,099.76 

 

12.5 Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 
provides that, “The accountant shall conduct regular and periodic verification, 
analysis, and validation of the existence of the receivables, unliquidated cash 
advances, and fund transfers, and determine the concerned debtors, accountable 
officers (Regular and Special Disbursing Officers, Collecting Officers, Cashiers) and 
the source and implementing government entities concerned. Reconcile the 
unliquidated fund transfers between the source and implementing government entities, 
prepare the adjusting entries for the reconciling items noted, and require liquidation 
of the balances.” 
 

12.6 Further review disclosed that long outstanding receivables in DPWH OSEC FAPs and  
Tacloban City DEO, amounting to P934,099.76, remained idle and uncollected for 
four (4) to more than five (5) years with details as follows:

 *since the adoption of e-NGAS in CY 2015 
 
12.7 Inquiry with the Accounting personnel disclosed that the past due receivables are 

accumulated balances transferred from the Other Receivables accounts as a result of 
the implementation of e-NGAS in CY 2015. Moreover, there are no other available 
information on these receivables, which hinders the enforcement of collection thereof. 
 

12.8 If Management will not endeavor to take further steps in enforcing collection of the 
past due accounts, there will be an accumulation of uncollected receivables which will 
ultimately deprive the Government of additional revenues that could be used for the 
implementation of other priority projects.  
 

12.9 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) provide the Audit Team with information of actions taken to enforce 
settlement of the recorded disallowances which have remained unsettled for 

more than four (4) years;  

 



151 
 

b) strictly adhere to Section 7.1 of the COA 2009 RRSA on the enforcement of 
settlements of audit disallowances; and 

 

c) exhaust all possible means to enforce collection of the long-outstanding 
receivables amounting to P934,099.76 and request for authority to write-off 
dormant receivable accounts that can no longer be collected/accounted 

pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005. 

 

 

Non-issuance of Certificate of Completion for completed projects – P185.679 billion 
 

13. Management of various DPWH offices have not issued the corresponding 
Certificates of Completion for 13,434 completed projects, thus, precluded the 

Accounting Division to reclassify the CIP accounts to the appropriate asset 

accounts pursuant to Section 8, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs and 

GAS Memorandum dated April 17, 2017. 

 

13.1 Section 8, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that: “During the 
construction period, all expenses incurred in relation to the construction of the PPE 
shall be taken up in the books as Construction in Progress (CIP) with the appropriate 
asset classification. As soon as the construction is completed, the “Construction in 
Progress” account shall be reclassified to the proper asset account. Likewise, all 
expenses such as interest, license fees, etc., during the construction period shall be 
capitalized.” 
 

13.2 Memorandum dated April 17, 2017 issued by COA’s Government Accountancy Sector 
(GAS) states that “The recognition of the CIP and the corresponding Accounts 
Payable (AP) equivalent to the unbilled amount and the transfer of the whole amount 
of the project from the CIP account to the appropriate PPE accounts shall be based 
on the Certificate of 100% Completion to be issued by the authorized officials such as 
the Project Management Team or Project Engineer and agency head, and other 
documents to support the said certificate of completion.” 
 

13.3 Audit of the CIP accounts of different DPWH offices disclosed that the account 
balance includes 13,434 completed projects with a total amount of 
P185,679,019,682.30 which are not reclassified to the appropriate Infrastructure 
Assets accounts due to non-issuance of the corresponding “Certificates of 
Completion” as required in the above-cited provisions. Details shown as follows:

13.4 One of the factors that contributed to the delay in reclassifying these completed 

infrastructure projects to the appropriate asset accounts is the agency’s practice to 
reclassify completed projects only when all claims due to the contractors concerned 
have been submitted, processed and paid. Management claimed that it is the only time 
where the Accounting Division was made aware of the projects status, considering that 
the projects were implemented by the Project Management Office 
(PMO)/Implementing Office (IO) and that the Accounting Division only processes the 
release of progress payments to the contractor upon submission of the required 
documents. 
 

13.5 Moreover, non-issuance of Certificates of Completion for 100 percent completed 
projects also precluded the recognition of Accounts Payable for the unbilled portion 
of contract costs for 469 projects in the amount of P5,957,026,740.71 despite 
completion of the projects.

13.6 In a letter dated November 16, 2020, Management opposed the COA-GAS opinion, 

citing their points of view and fact on the said issues, and praying that their opposition 
be included for review, reconsideration and clarification. The said letter was referred 
to COA GAS by the Audit Team for further consideration and disposition, with the 
resolution included in the enhancement of the GAM for NGAs. 
 

13.7 Hereunder are the Management’s contentions on the GAS ruling: 
 

 The recognition of the liability based on the unbilled amount at completion 
date is not in accord with Section 5, Item 5.1, Annex E of the 2016 RIRR of 
RA No.9184. It is also inconsistent with Section 47, Item 12, Chapter 10, 
Volume I of GAM for NGAs on the construction of PPE which documentary 
requirements include the Certificate of Acceptance and the approved/certified 
final Statement of Work Accomplished (SWA) by the contractor. The 
Certificate of Acceptance will issue after a year the Certificate of Completion 
was issued. 
 



155 
 

 Recognition of an unbilled amount as a liability usually taken as a final cost 
accomplished by the contractor, per approved/certified final SWA, less the 
billed amount which could not be determine without the approved final SWA. 

 
13.8 Nonetheless, the Audit Team maintained their position that the late recording of 

completed projects to its appropriate infrastructure accounts violated Section 8(g), 
Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, which requires recognition of completed 
projects in the books of the agency during the period of the project completion.  
 

13.9 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) direct the Implementing Office (IO) to establish the status of all projects 
with unpaid billings, particularly, the projects which are already 100 

percent completed, with corresponding Certificates of Completion and 

submit the same to the Accounting Division as  basis of recording; and 

 

b) further instruct the Accounting Division to reclassify the total costs of 
completed projects from CIP accounts to the appropriate asset accounts 

based on the Certificates of Completion issued by the IO in accordance with 

Section 8.g, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs and the 

Memorandum of the COA GAS dated April 17, 2017. 
 
 

Non-disposal of unserviceable equipment – P18.184 million 
 

14. Unserviceable equipment of various DPWH offices with total amount of 
P18,184,065.95, which entailed additional costs for storage/maintenance and 

exposed to further deterioration susceptible to fire and health hazards, were not 

disposed of, as required under Section 79 of PD No. 1445. 
 
14.1 Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides that, “Destruction or sale of unserviceable 

property. When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is 
no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefor, be 
inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the 
presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be 
destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to 
the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee an award or similar 
body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative 
of the Commission, after advertising by printed notice in the Official Gazette, or for 
not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of general circulation, or where 
the value of the property does not warrant the expense of publication, by notices posted 
for a like period in at least three public places in the locality where the property is to 
be sold. In the event that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private 
sale at such price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned and 
approved by the Commission.” 
 



156 
 

14.2 Further, Section 40 (d), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, provides that, 
“a PPE is said to be unserviceable if it is no longer capable of providing the entity 
with future economic benefits or service potential. Further, all unserviceable property 
shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property 
(IIRUP).  PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting 
Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated 
Depreciation).” 
 

14.3 Audit of PPE account of the DPWH offices disclosed that 812 units of various 
equipment with a total book value of P18,184,065.95 that were unserviceable for a 
long time were not yet disposed, contrary to above-cited provision of PD No. 1445, to 
wit:

14.4 The obsolete/unserviceable properties have caused congestion in the Agency’s storage 

spaces which could have been allocated for the new and serviceable properties. 
Moreover, their deteriorated condition is susceptible to fire and health hazards to 
employees. 
 

14.5 We recommended that Management direct the respective Property Officers of 
the DPWH offices concerned to prepare the updated and duly accomplished 
IIRUP and other relevant supporting documents and facilitate the immediate 

disposal of the unserviceable properties.  
 
 
Non-liquidation of fund transfers received from Source Agencies – P994.735 million 
 
15. Transferred funds from various NGAs amounting to P994,734,978.93 remained 

unliquidated for more than one (1) to over five (5) years due to non-submission 

of liquidation reports/non refund of excess funds and/or unused/idle funds from 

implemented projects, contrary to Section 63, Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM 

for NGAs and Section 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013. 
 
15.1 Section 63 Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides the guidelines on the 

disbursement of Inter-Agency Transferred Funds (IATF) which requires that “a 



157 
 

Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) shall be entered into by the Source Agency (SA) 
and the Implementing Agency (IA) for the undertaking by the latter of the project of 
the former. The MOA shall provide for the requirements for project implementation 
and reporting. Likewise, the fund to be transferred or sub-allotted to the IA shall be 
the total project cost as may be determined by the Heads of the two agencies in either 
case.” 
 

15.2 Section 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 and Section 63.f, Chapter 6 of the same 
Manual states that within 10 days after the end of each month/end of the agreed       period 
for the Project, the IA shall submit RCI or Report of Disbursements (RD) to report the 
utilization of the funds. Only actual project expenses shall be reported. The reports 
shall be approved by the Head of the IA. Likewise, Section 63.g of the said GAM also 
provides that the IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon  completion of the 
project, if stipulated in the MOA. 
 

15.3 Audit of the Due to NGAs account showed that the total fund                                    transfers received from 
various government agencies aggregating P994,734,978.93 remained unliquidated as

15.4 The foregoing balances remained outstanding for one (1) year to over five (5) years 

due to non-submission of liquidation reports of the DPWH offices concerned, as well 
as, unused/unutilized funds were not refunded. Failure to refund or return these funds 
to the SAs would expose them to misappropriation or misapplication. 
 



158 
 

15.5 We recommended that Management submit to the SAs concerned the liquidation 
reports for the outstanding fund transfers and return/remit to the SAs or the BTr, 

as the case may be, any unused funds remaining in their account. 
 
  
Incurrence of Commitment Fees – P89.518 million 
 

16. The provisions of the loan agreements/contracts and DO No. 193 dated 
September 15, 2016, were not observed and/or complied with in the 

implementation of foreign-assisted infrastructure projects funded by Official 

Development Assistance (ODA) which adversely affected the timely utilization of 

the loan proceeds and completion of the projects resulting in the incurrence of 

commitment fees amounting to P89,518,140.12 for CY 2020. 

 
16.1 One of the primary considerations of the government in entering into a contract is the 

timely completion of the infrastructure projects so that the intended benefits may be 
achieved. Consequently, the contracting parties are bound to adhere faithfully to the 
agreed terms and conditions of the contract.  
 

16.2 Generally, loan agreements entered into by the Philippine government with foreign 
governments/agencies contains provision on payment of commitment fees to ensure 
utilization of the loan proceeds within the approved Implementation Schedule 
embodied in the loan agreement and other loan documents, immediate payment of 
claims by foreign contractors and consultants, and avoid delay in the implementation 
of infrastructure projects. The said provision for commitment fees also ensures that 
the government maximizes the utilization of the loan before closing date. 
 

16.3 Further, DPWH DO No. 193 dated September 15, 2016 was issued to ensure timely 
completion of projects and effectively institutes remedial steps in response to delays 
in project implementation.  
 

16.4 Review and evaluation of the documents from the BTr disclosed that the government 
incurred commitment fees totaling P89,518,140.12 for CY 2020, due to the delayed 
implementation of the following FAPs, some of which were included in the previous 
year’s audit report. Details are as follows:

16.5 The amount of P89,518,140.12 of commitment fees was incurred due to the delayed 
implementation of the programmed projects.  The two (2) projects namely IGCMRSP 
under Loan Agreement No. 3631-PHI  and MMFMP under Loan Agreement Nos. 
8784-PH and 00023-1PHL contributed the largest part of the total commitment fees.  
 

16.6 Analysis of related documents and ODA reports submitted by Management as of 
December 31, 2020, disclosed that the following factors, among others, contributed to 
the delay/non-implementation of the aforementioned projects: 
 

Table 42 – Factors that Contributed on Delay in Implementation of Project  
Project Name Remarks/Cause/s for Delay/Non-Implementation 

IGCMRSP There were delays in the procurement of five (5) non-core projects brought 
about by the multiple postponements in the deadline of submission of bids and 
bid opening. Likewise, the Notices to Proceed for the other four (4) projects 
were only issued in the first quarter of CY 2021 and one (1) project will have 
to undergo re-bidding due to failure of the contractor to submit documents for 
the perfection of contract. 
 
Likewise, the project was delayed due to the late processing of Right-of-Way 
compensation to affected persons due to incomplete documents/ requirements 
and prolonged procurement of the contractor and effects of COVID-19 
pandemic in CY 2020.  

MMFMP Rehabilitation of 36 Pumping Stations - Rehabilitation of the Balut Pumping 
Station is still ongoing and is slightly behind schedule. Manufacturing of 
Horizontal Submersible Axial Flow Pump is from August 2019 to December 
2019 while delivery at site was on April 2020.  
 
Construction of new 20 Pumping Stations – Feasibility Study and Detailed 
Engineering Design is yet to be undertaken by the Engineering and 
Management Consultant, which is still being procured. 
  
The design, bidding plans, and cost estimates were done in-house under the 
DPWH Bureau of Design due to the delayed procurement of consulting 
services. The proposed design works was also required to be coordinated with 
the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority since the Operation and 
Management of the pumping stations is under their jurisdiction. 

IPIF Delay in implementation of some activities and submission of reports. Out of 
the 10 projects, four (4) were completed, three (3) are on-going while the 
remaining three (3) were not yet started.

Project Name Remarks/Cause/s for Delay/Non-Implementation 
Moreover, the submission of claim documents by the Consultant was likewise 
delayed due to tax issues.  

RUPP Delayed implementation of the Taberna Bridge in Mindoro and Clarin Bridge 
in Bohol, and realignment of some road maintenance sub-projects in Central 
Luzon under the long-term performance-based maintenance-cum-enhancement 
(LTPME) component of the project. 

CLLEX Delays were encountered in RROW acquisition (through expropriation) in 
Aliaga and Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija.  Also, delays were encountered due to the 
imposition of COVID-19 community quarantines. 

RIIDP The project was completed in December 2019, however, there was delay in the 
submission of Project Completion Report (PCR) due to the late submission by 
the Consultant of all individual contracts’ completion reports for consolidation/ 
finalization of the PCR. 

Flood Risk 
Management 
Project for 
Cagayan River, 
Tagolaon River 
and Imus River 

Delays in RROW acquisition activities due to sheer number of claimants 
estimated at more than 1000 families (Imus River Component).  Delay in 
project implementation was also due to imposition of community quarantines 
brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
In addition, there were only a small amount of claims/billings submitted by the 
Consultants and approved prior to the loan expiration which was also affected 
by the pandemic. 

 
16.7 The delay in the implementation of the projects resulted in the deferment of the 

delivery of services that could have been derived from the immediate use of these 
projects. Likewise, slow availment/low utilization of loan proceeds caused the 
incurrence of higher commitment fees contrary to the existing provisions of ensuring 
utilization of the loan proceeds within the approved Implementation Schedule 
embodied in the loan agreements/contracts as well as institution of remedial measures 
under DO No. 193 in response to delays in project implementation. 
 

16.8 We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation that Management 
accelerate/maximize the utilization of loan proceeds by adopting efficient and 

remedial procedures in accordance with the guidelines of the foreign lending 

institutions, the loan agreements/contracts and DO No. 193 to lessen delays 

thereby minimizing incurrence of commitment fees. 
 

16.9 Management informed that due to unexpected issues/problems encountered and 
sudden events that were beyond the control of the Department that adversely affected 
the timely completion of the projects resulted in the delayed utilization of loan 
proceeds. Nevertheless, Management assured that remedial actions are being 
undertaken to ensure the acceleration/maximization of the loan proceeds and minimize 
the incurrence of commitment fees.

Unrelated Expenses Charged against Engineering and Administrative Overhead (EAO) – 
P43.852 million 
 

17. Expenditures totaling to P43,851,841.99 which were not directly related to pre-
construction and implementation of the projects were charged against EAO 

funds, contrary to the Special Provision (SP) No. 11 of the DPWH GAA FY 2020.  

 
17.1 Section 11 of the SP of the DPWH GAA FY 2020, provides for the treatment of project 

related expenses, to wit: 
 
“Project-Related Expenses. For infrastructure projects costing One Million Pesos 
(P1,000,000.00), the DPWH is authorized to deduct, but not to exceed the following 
percentages of the project civil works cost, to be used for: (i) engineering and 
administrative overhead (EAO) expenses or (ii) Maintenance and Other Operating 
Expenses; 

 
(a) three and one-half percent (3.5%) for releases to the Central Office 
(b) two and one-half percent (2.5%) for releases to the Regional Offices 

(ROs); 
(c) two percent (2%) for releases to the District Engineering Offices (DEOs); 
(d) one percent (1%) for infrastructure projects under the Local 

Infrastructure Program undertaken by the Central Office, ROs or DEOs; 
PROVIDED, that the 1% EAO shall be given only to the implementing 
unit, regardless where the funds was released; and 

(e) one-half percent (0.5%) for infrastructure projects of other agencies 
undertaken by the Central Office, ROs or DEOs. 

  
For EAO expenses, the same shall be limited to: (i) administrative overhead including 
the hiring of individuals engaged through job-orders or contracts of service or such 
other engagement of personnel without any employer-employee relationship; (ii) pre-
construction activities after detailed engineering; (iii) construction project 
management; (iv) testing quality control; (v) acquisition, rehabilitation and repair of 
related equipment and parts; and (vi) contingencies in relation to pre-construction 
activities. The EAO expenses shall be booked-up as capitalized expenditure and form 
part of the project cost.” 

 
17.2 Audit and analysis of the Construction in Progress–Infrastructure Assets (CIP-IA) 

account of the DPWH as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that charges/debits to the 
account for CY 2020 included expenses amounting to P43,851,841.99 which were not 
in any way directly related to the pre-construction and implementation of 
infrastructure projects, in violation of the above-cited special provision of GAA FY 
2020, summarized as follows:

17.3 The non-project related expenses included overtime pay, office supplies expenses, 

traveling expenses, telephone/internet expenses, renewal of registration of government 
vehicles, fidelity bond, janitorial, security, traveling expenses and other maintenance 
and other operating expenses that were charged to EAO but are not categorized among 
the six (6) items of EAO expenses provided in Section 11 of the Special Provision for 
the DPWH GAA FY 2020, as well as, expenses not related to the implementation of 
projects. Thus, these EAO expenses should not be charged against EAO funds.  
 

17.4 Moreover, overtime pay of regular employees, gratuity pay and hazard pay clearly do 
not fall under MOOE or EAO expenses, but rather these are considered as Personnel 
Services expenditures, hence  contrary to the special provisions mentioned above.  
 

17.5 Management of different DPWH District offices explained that the said unrelated 
project expenses mentioned above were charged to EAO funds due to limited 
allocation of Personnel Services (PS) and MOOE funds to the Districts.  However, the 
Audit Team opined that insufficiency or absence of funds for PS and MOOE is not a 
valid reason for Management not to comply with the existing rules and regulations in 
the proper recording of expenses incurred as well as the utilization of EAO funds. 
 

17.6 If Management will not address the problem of allowing unrelated expenditures 
charged to EAO, the practice might be abused as it gives Management, particularly 
their officials, the liberty to charge anything from project funds at their own 
preference. 
 

17.7 We recommended that the officials and personnel concerned of the DPWH offices 
concerned should stop the practice of utilizing EAO for expenses not related to 

the pre-construction and implementation of infrastructure projects and limit the 

charging of expenditure against EAO funds to those enumerated under items (i) 
to (vi) of the Special Provision No. 11 of the CY GAA, to avoid disallowance in 
audit. Henceforth, make representation to the DBM for additional budget and 

funding to cover for PS and MOOE expenses of the District Offices so as to 

prevent improper utilization of the EAO funds.

Delayed completion and non-implementation of projects – P108.319 billion 
 
18. Absence of proper coordination with LGUs, DENR and other agencies concerned 

and failure to establish the technical viability of the projects during the feasibility 

and preliminary engineering study resulted in delayed completion and non-

implementation of 3,283 infrastructure projects totaling P108,318,959,271.99, 

contrary to Paragraphs 1 and 2, of Annex A of RIRR of RA No. 9184, and the 

agreed terms and conditions of the contracts.  

 

18.1 One of the primary considerations of the government for entering into a contract is the 
timely completion of the infrastructure projects so that the intended benefits may be 
achieved. Consequently, the contracting parties are bound to adhere faithfully to 
agreed terms and conditions of the contract. 
 

18.2 The RIRR of RA No. 9184, requires the conduct of detailed engineering for the 
procurement of infrastructure projects. Paragraph 1 of Annex “A” thereof states that 
“detailed engineering shall proceed only on the basis of the feasibility or preliminary 
engineering study made which establishes the technical viability of the project and 
conformance to land use and zoning guideline as prescribed by existing laws.” 
Paragraph 2 enumerates the detailed engineering activities which include among 
others: 

 
 survey and site investigation;  
 soils and foundation investigation;  
 construction materials investigation;  
 preparation of design plans and technical specifications;  
 preparation of site or right of way acquisition plans and resettlement action 

plans;  
 preparation of utility relocation plans; and  
 value engineering studies. 

 
18.3 Further, paragraph 8, Annex E of the same RIRR on Liquidated Damages states that: 
 

“Where the contractor refuses or fails to satisfactorily complete the work 
within the specified contract time, plus anytime extension duly granted 
and is hereby in default under the contract, the contractor shall pay the 
procuring entity for liquidated damages, and not by way of penalty, an 
amount, as provided in the conditions of the contract, equal to at least 
one tenth (1/10) of one (1) percent of the cost of the unperformed portion 
of the works for every day of delay”. 
 
“In case that delay in the completion of the work exceeds a time duration 
equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the specified contract time plus 
anytime extension duly granted to the contractor, the procuring entity 
concerned may rescind the contract, forfeit the contractor’s performance 
security and takeover the prosecution of the project or award the same 



164 
 

to a qualified contractor through negotiated contract”. 
 

18.4 Evaluation of the status of 3,283 regular infrastructure projects, school buildings (SB) 
and Farm to Market Road (FMR) projects totaling P108,318,959,271.99 implemented 
by the DPWH offices disclosed that (a) 2,766 projects with a total cost of 
P87,082,859,548.26 were not finished or completed within the specific contract time 
or required completion date; (b) 348 projects amounting to P15,763,822,620.35 were 
suspended; (c) seven (7) projects costing P1,036,600,992.28 were terminated; and              
(d) 162 projects amounting to P4,435,676,111.10 have not been started at all during 
the year. Breakdown as follows:

18.5 Perusal of the report on the status of projects showed that significant delays in the 

implementation of the projects were caused by numerous suspension orders, time 
extensions and variation orders issued by the DPWH offices due to the following 
factors which the consultants and Management failed to consider during the 
preliminary engineering study on the viability of the projects: 

 
 Typhoon or unfavorable weather condition; 
 RROW; 
 Relocation of utilities and communication facilities (Maynilad, Meralco, and the 

like); 
 Pending issuance of permit/clearance from LGUs, DENR, MMDA, 

Homeowner’s Association, and from other agencies; 
 Modification of plans, design and program of works; 
 Modification and realignment of location/non-availability of project site 

location; 
 Accessibility of the project site is dependent on the completion of the other 

project; 
 Insufficient workforce/manpower provided by the contractors; 
 Limited equipment on site; 
 Inaccessible project site for heavy equipment; 
 Lack of access going to the project site; 
 Late release of funds; 
 Conflict/overlapping projects with LGU; 
 Construction activities suspended by Barangay Chairman; 
 Late arrival/mobilization of equipment from abroad; and 
 Delayed submission of Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples Plan by the 

Consultants as required by the lending institution. 
 
18.6 Except for typhoon or unfavorable weather condition, all issues enumerated above, as 

well as, the necessity of coordination with the LGUs and other agencies concerned, 
are factors which are unintentional but procedural and consequential issues that should 
have been considered and resolved during the preliminary engineering study on the 
viability of the project and pre-construction activities, for Management to effectively 
institute remedial steps to address the issues  prior to the finalization of the scope of 
works to ensure timely completion of projects. 
 

18.7 Absence of coordination mechanism in place, which is among the vital parts of the 
feasibility and preliminary engineering study, hampered the immediate completion of 
the projects that resulted in inefficient implementation of the programs/projects, 
contrary to the aforecited provisions of Paragraph 2, Annex A of the RIRR of RA No. 
9184. 
 



168 
 

 

 

18.8 We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations that DPWH offices: 
 

a) ensure full coordination with other government agencies, among others, the 
LGUs and DENR, including the community and private utilities, to achieve 

effective and more synchronized planning and implementation of programs 

and projects; and 

 

b) consider the disqualification and/or blacklisting of contractors involved, 
and initiate the immediate take-over process of terminated projects to 

facilitate completion of the projects within the project timeframe. 

 
18.9 Henceforth, minimize the delays in project implementation by: 
 

a) conscientiously carrying out the detailed engineering to ensure that issues 
such as relocation of informal settlers and viability of the project sites are 

properly addressed during the feasibility or preliminary engineering study 

prior to project implementation; 

 

b) thoroughly reviewing and evaluating the Program of Work to ensure that 
project designs and estimates are properly prepared and that all phases of 

the projects are covered to minimize variation orders and time extensions 

which often resulted in the increase of project cost and delayed completion; 

 

c) directing the BAC to properly verify and evaluate during post-qualification 
the operating conditions of equipment and other construction 

requirements, among others, to ensure adequacy, availability and 

suitability of the contractor’s technical capability; and 

 

d) strict monitoring and supervision of the projects implemented by different 
DPWH offices. 

 
 
Failure to impose liquidated damages – P719.692 million 
 

19. Liquidated damages were not imposed and collected on 24 projects with total cost 
of P719,691,830.60 with delays ranging from 14 to 622 days from the target 

completion dates contrary to Section 8.1 of the RIRR of RA No. 9184. 

 
19.1 Section 8.1 of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 provides that, where the contractor refuses 

or fails to satisfactorily complete the work within the specified contract time, plus any 
time extension duly granted and is hereby in default under the contract, the contractor 
shall pay the procuring entity for liquidated damages, and not by way of penalty, an 
amount, as provided in the conditions of contract, equal to at least one tenth (1/10) of 
one (1) percent of the cost of unperformed portion of the works for every day of delay.  



169 
 

 
19.2 Records showed that 24 projects totaling to P719,691,830.60 were completed beyond 

the target completion dates ranging from 14 to 622 days; however, no liquidated 
damages were imposed and collected from the payments made to the contractors, as 
summarized in Table 48:

Total 24 719,691,830.60  

 
19.3 Despite the noticeable non-completion of the project within the agreed contract time, 

the DPWH offices concerned did not impose liquidated damages in every day of delay 
against the contractor nor reported a percentage of slippage as required under the afore-
cited provision of the RIRR of RA No. 9184. 
 

19.4 The foregoing conditions showed Management’s weak monitoring/validation of the 
status of infrastructure projects, improper reporting and leniency in penalizing 
inefficient performance of contractors and suppliers. 
 

19.5 Consequently, the situation deprived the government to be indemnified for the 
damages it suffered due to default of contractors in delivering projects needed by it 
from a specific time. 
 

19.6 We recommended that Management of DPWH offices concerned to impose and 
collect liquidated damages from contractors whose projects were completed 

beyond the specified contract duration. 
 
 
Unsupported Expenditures – P4.221 billion 
 
20. Various expenditures totaling P4,220,699,011.23 were made without proper and 

complete supporting documents and relevant documentary requirements 

contrary to Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated 

June 14, 2012. 
 
20.1 Section 4 (6) of PD No. 1445 or the State Audit Code of the Philippines states that 

“Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.” 
This provision is one of the fundamental principles governing financial transactions 
and operations of any government agency. 
 
 



170 
 

20.2 In line with this, COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 was issued to 
prescribe the revised guidelines and documentary requirements for common 
government transactions which incorporated the requirements under existing 
issuances of the Commission. 
 

20.3 Audit of disbursements of different DPWH offices revealed that expenditures totaling 
P4,220,699,011.23 were paid despite of improper and incomplete supporting 
documents, to wit:

20.4 As a result, the payments of the above cited disbursements/transactions without 

complete supporting documents by various DPWH offices were contrary to the 
aforecited provisions of PD No. 1445, thus, suspended in audit. 
 

20.5 We recommended that Management of DPWH offices concerned to submit the 
lacking documents immediately to comply strictly with Section 4(6) of PD No. 

1445 and COA Circular 2012-001.

Non-enforcement of Construction Safety and Health Standards (CSHS) – P390.412 million 

 
21. Items included in the Program of Work (POW) pertaining to Construction Safety 

and Health Standards totaling P390,411,561.76 were not enforced during project 

implementation contrary to DOLE DO No. 13 series of 1998 and DPWH DO No. 

56. 

 

21.1 The DOLE DO No. 13, series of 1998, was issued to set the guidelines governing 
occupational safety and health standards in the construction industry. This order was 
anchored on Article 162 of PD No. 442, otherwise known as the Labor Code of the 
Philippines, which authorizes the DOLE Secretary to set and enforce mandatory 
Occupational Safety and Health Standards to eliminate or reduce occupational safety 
and health hazards in all work places, and institute new and update existing programs 
to ensure safe and healthful working conditions in all places of employment. 
 

21.2 In line with DOLE DO No. 13, the DPWH issued DO No. 56, series of 2005, setting 
the guidelines, rules and procedures to be followed by all concerned in the 
implementation of the Construction Safety and Health Standards, with emphasis given 
on the methodology to be used in estimating the cost of construction safety and health 
programs. Section III.A of the said DO states that the implementation of construction 
safety shall be considered in all stages of project procurement (design, estimate and 
construction) and its cost shall be integrated to the overall project cost under Pay Item 
“SPL – Construction Safety and Health” as a lump sum amount, to be quantified in the 
detailed estimate. Likewise, all requirements, provisions, and instructions pertaining 
to the implementation of Construction Safety and Health in every project shall be 
included in the project bidding documents specifically under Instructions to Bidders. 
 

21.3 Construction safety and health is included in contracts and program of works as 
Special Pay Item (SPL) and included in the total contract cost. This means, the budget 
allocated to contracts incorporates safety gears or personal protective devices for 
workers to avoid fatal accidents throughout the construction period. 
 

21.4 Review of various infrastructure projects implemented by the following DPWH 
offices in CY 2020, showed that the program of work/budget cost of these projects 
included provision for Construction Safety and Health Program amounting to 
P390,411,561.76, broken down in table 50:

21.5 Verification made by the Audit Teams revealed that not one from among the workforce 

used construction safety and health items such as, safety gears or personal protective 
devices. This is an indication that the guidelines, rules and procedures prescribed by 
the DOLE and DPWH DOs dealing with Occupational Safety and Health standards 
were not implemented, thus, the objective of eliminating and reducing occupational 
safety and health hazards in infrastructure work places was not promoted/observed in 
these projects. 
 

21.6 The non-implementation of this special pay item in any project gives the Agency the 
right to deduct, or to be refunded of, the amount that pertains to the pay item from the 
claims of a contractor. Otherwise, it should be disallowed in audit. 
 

21.7 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) direct the respective Accountants of the DPWH offices concerned to deduct 
from the respective contractor’s billing the amount corresponding to 

Construction Safety and Health Program and impose sanctions to 

contractors and DPWH personnel concerned for violating the afore-cited 

DOs, pursuant to Section IV.C of  DO No. 56, series of 2005; 

 

b) closely monitor the proper implementation of the Occupational Safety and 
Health Standards and Programs in each construction project to ensure the 

safety of every worker employed therein, as well as the commuters and 

general public; and 

 

c) direct the Safety Engineers concerned to oblige the contractors to properly 
and constantly implement the said Safety and Health Programs and 

Standards. 

 
 
 
 
 



173 
 

Technical defects in 165 infrastructure projects – P339.105 million 
 

22. Due to lack of proper monitoring and supervision, 165 infrastructure projects 
undertaken by various DPWH offices were not executed in accordance with the 

provisions stipulated in the respective Contract Agreement resulting in various 

technical defects equivalent to a total cost of deficiencies of P339,105,075.06. 

 

22.1 It is the mandate and mission of the DPWH to provide and manage quality 
infrastructure facilities and services responsive to the needs of the Filipino people in 
pursuit of National Development objectives. 
 

22.2 Section 2 of PD No. 1445, states that: “xxx.. All resources of the government shall be 
managed, expended or utilized in accordance with laws and regulations, and 
safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a 
view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operation of government. 
xxx.” 
 

22.3 Section 62.2.2.1 of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 provides that the defects liability period 
for infrastructure projects shall be one year from project completion up to final 
acceptance by the government. The contractor shall undertake the repair works, at his 
own expense, of any damage to the infrastructure on account of the use of materials of 
inferior quality, within ninety (90) days from the time the HoPE has issued an order to 
undertake repair. In case of failure or refusal to comply with this mandate, the 
Procuring Entity shall undertake such repair works and shall be entitled to full 
reimbursement of expenses incurred therein upon demand. 
 

22.4 Section 62.2.2.2 of the same RIRR also provides that the defects liability period shall 
be covered by the Performance Security of the contractor, which shall guarantee that 
the contractor performs his responsibilities. If the contractor fails to comply with its 
obligations under Section 62.2.2.1 of the RIRR, the Procuring Entity shall forfeit its 
performance security, subject its property(ies) to attachment or garnishment 
proceedings, and perpetually disqualify it from participating in any competitive 
bidding. All payables of the GOP in his favor shall be offset to recover the costs. 
 

22.5 Inspection of various infrastructure projects conducted by the COA – Technical Audit 
Specialists during the year revealed that there were defects/deficiencies including items 
of work which were not in accordance with the standard specifications of the contracts 
as discussed below:

22.6 The above defects/deficiencies will result in the wastage of government funds and 
property if not corrected by the contractors in due time. 
 

22.7 The same observations were raised in the previous year Audit Report, which remained 
unacted by Management, hence, this reiteration. A Notice of Suspension/Notice of 
Disallowance/Notice of Charge will be issued by the Audit Team for non-
compliance/violation of Section 62 of the RIRR of RA No. 9184. 
 

22.8 We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations that the respective DPWH 
offices: 

 

a) require all the contractors concerned to rectify immediately the deficiencies 
noted on the above-mentioned projects to conform with the approved 

program of works or forfeit the Performance Security to prevent issuance 

of NS/ND/NC by the COA, and consider blacklisting the contractors 

concerned who refuse to effect the necessary corrections; and 

 

b) direct the DPWH Inspectorate Teams concerned to, henceforth, conduct 
regular and strict monitoring and supervision to ensure that all contractors 

implement the projects in accordance with the approved program of works.  
 

22.9 Management of the DPWH offices concerned informed that the said defects and 
deficiencies were already coordinated with the contractors concerned and assigned 
Project Engineer for the proposed corrections and rectification. Likewise, the DPWH 
offices will be required to submit reports together with pictures once corrections will 
be made and re-inspection will be requested. Several rectifications have already been 
made and liquidated damages imposed/collected. 

 
 
Deficiencies in posting of project billboards for PPAs 
 
23. Four hundred ninety-two (492) infrastructure projects implemented by DPWH 

offices in Regions CAR, I, II, III, IX and XIII did not have signboards and/or 

were not compliant with the posting of the required information on the projects 

as provided under COA Circular No. 2013-004 and DPWH DO No. 21, series of 

2017. 

 

23.1 COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 2013, states that: 
 

 Section 2.2.1 “ All government agencies, or the implementing unit, office or 
division as the case may be, shall notify the public of their 
projects/programs/activities (PPA) through the posting of relevant information 
(project name, implementing unit, office or division if it is not the agency as a 
whole, brief description of the PPA, contractor or supplier, if any, funding 
source, cost or approved budget, project duration including start and 
completion dates, and location) on signboards, blackboards, whiteboards, 



176 
 

posters, tarpaulins, streamers, electronic boards or similar materials 
(collectively, “Signboards”)”. 

 
 Section 2.2.3 “For infrastructure projects, a tarpaulin signboard must be 

suitably frame for outdoor display at the project location, and shall be posted as 
soon as the award has been made.” 

 
 Section 2.2.6 “The display and/or affixture of the picture, image, motto, logo, 

color motif, initials or other symbol or graphic representation associated with 
the top leadership of the project proponent or implementing agency/unit/office, 
on Signboards, is considered unnecessary.” 

 
 Section 3.1 “The Head of the Agency shall inform its ATL within ten (10) days 

after the award of the infrastructure project or the start of the program/activity 
that the appropriate project signboards and/or public notices are already 
posted, and the SA and ATL shall validate the same.” 

 
23.2 Further, DPWH DO No. 21, series of 2017, dated February 22, 2017, provides the 

revised guidelines in the preparation and installation of project billboards for DPWH 
projects which supersedes DO No. 141, series of 2016. The new billboard design 
layout, dimension, and letter sizes on white background shall be depicted on a standard 
measurement that should be adopted in all projects. 
 

23.3 The Audit Teams of Regions CAR, I, II, III, IX and XIII validated the project 
signboards through the audit of disbursement vouchers and ocular inspection on 
various infrastructure projects implemented by these regions concerned and revealed 
deficiencies as follows:

23.4 Despite of prior years’ audit recommendations, verification and validation of   project 

billboards revealed incomplete information. The name of projects/implementing 
office/contractor; amount of contact, and effectivity and completion date of the 
projects, pertaining to the projects implemented by the DPWH offices concerned were 
not fully disclosed to the public nor regularly updated, hence, defeating the purpose in 
which these signboards were posted. 
 

23.5 Further, Management of Tarlac 1st and 2nd DEOs, and Region I, failed to comply with 
Section 3.1 of the abovementioned COA Circular as the Audit Teams were not   
informed within 10 days after the award of the projects or before their start and that 
appropriate project signboards and/or public notices were already posted at the project 
sites.   
 

23.6 Management’s non-conformity and/or failure to display the required signboards set 
forth by law not only violated the State’s policy of full disclosure of all transactions 
involving public interest but also deprived the public of the right to information on 
matters of public concern. 
 

23.7 We reiterated our previous year’s recommendation that the Regional Director in 
Region IX and respective District Engineers of the Regions CAR, I, II, III and 

XIII ensure that DPWH and COA project signboards are properly installed and 

conform with the prescribed guidelines of DPWH DO No. 21, series of 2017 and 

COA Circular No. 2013-004 to inform the public on matters of public concerns and 

to fully adopt the full disclosure policy of all transactions governing public 

interest.  
 

23.8 The following are the comments of the DPWH offices concerned: 
 

Table 52-A  Management Comments 
Region Office Management Comments/Actions 

CAR Benguet 2nd DEO Has already submitted additional pictures of the billboards of 
three projects to support the payment.  Meanwhile, for the 
billboards of the other three projects with no additional 
supporting pictures, they will deduct the equivalent cost of 
P11,966.86 from the billings of the contractors concerned.

Management agreed to comply with the recommendation.  
The District Engineers of the DPWH DEOs concerned have 
issued a memorandum to the Construction Section and all 
Project Engineers as well as the Monitoring Engineer to 
require the contractor concerned at the inception of the 
project to disclose complete project details on the 
billboard/tarpaulin which will be posted at the project site 
until the project completion in order to attain transparency in 
the implementation of government projects.  Pictures of the 
said project billboards/tarpaulins will be attached to the 
Disbursement Vouchers as supporting documents for the 
payments of the project billings. 

II Nueva Vizcaya 1st 
DEO 

Management admitted and explained that the signboards 
were previously programmed on a 4’ x 8’ size only, hence, 
committed to henceforth, comply with the COA Circular and 
require the Project Engineers to ensure that the details 
required in the project signboards are provided and regularly 
updated in compliance to the audit recommendation. 

III Aurora DEO Management assured that compliance with COA Circular 
No. 2013-004 shall be strictly observed and will not allow 
claims and payments to contractors who do not comply with 
the said regulation.  The deficiencies noted during inspection 
were already complied and rectified. 

Bataan 1st DEO The Chief Implementing Unit explained that some of the 
project billboards were stolen.  Nevertheless, he already 
instructed the contractors to install the project billboards and 
ensure that these will be continuously posted during the 
project duration. 

Bataan 2nd DEO An unnumbered memorandum dated February 15, 2021, 
signed by the District Engineer was issued instructing the 
Head of the Implementing Units and Project Engineer to 
ensure that standard project billboards are installed in the 
construction sites of all on-going projects. 

Tarlac 2nd DEO The District Engineer committed that he will issue a 
Memorandum to the Construction Section for the strict 
compliance of the COA Circular on project billboards. 

XIII Agusan del Norte Management commented that it will implement the 
recommendation and fill up the necessary information in 
every project billboard as soon as possible. 

 
 
Non- compliance with the provisions of RA No. 9184 and its RIRR 

 
24. A total of 70 DPWH offices have not fully complied with 20 provisions of RA No. 

9184 and its RIRR which prevented transparency, competitiveness, equity, 

efficiency and economy in the process of procurement of the Agency’s various 

projects in the total amount of at least P43,755,500,294.17. 

 

24.1 RA No. 9184 and its RIRR were promulgated for the purpose of prescribing the 
necessary rules and regulations for the standardization and regulation of procurement 
activities of all government agencies and instrumentalities. Provisions therein are in 
line with the government’s efforts to adhere to the principles of transparency, 



179 
 

accountability, equity, efficiency and economy in the procurement process. 
 

24.2 Auditorial, legal and technical review of the contract documents of the projects 
undertaken by 70 DPWH offices in the total amount of at least P43,755,500,294.17 
revealed departures from 20 provisions of the RIRR of RA No. 9184, with details 
shown in Annex B. 
 

24.3 We recommended that Management, through the BAC and the Offices concerned, 
strictly conform with the provisions of RA No. 9184 and its RIRR in all stages of 

the procurement of goods and services and infrastructure projects, and comply 

with the timely completion of the entire procurement process, including careful 

bid evaluation and post-qualification of bidders to preclude any issues that may 

arise upon implementation of the projects.

issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned. Within the same period, 
the Auditor shall review and point out to Management defects and/or 
deficiencies, if any.” 

 
 Section 4.1- the penalty clause for such non-compliance, to wit: “Any unjustified

25.4 Management commented that the delays in the submission of contract documents/POs   

were mainly due to the limited workforce, adoption of irregular/alternative work 
schedules, restrained mobility, and logistics problems brought about by the COVID-
19 pandemic. They have also mentioned that in addition, the following factors 
contributed to the delayed/non-submission of infrastructure contracts and POs to the 
Audit Teams: 

 
 Lack of sufficient manpower who shall take charge in the reproduction of 

documents considering the volume of the projects and the supporting 
documents; 

 Significant increase in infrastructure projects resulting to voluminous documents 
to be reproduced and certified by authorized representative; 

 Late submission of Performance Bonds and other supporting documents by the 
contractors;  

 Late releases of documents such as the Construction Safety and Health Program 
approved by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE); 

 Late confirmation of suppliers and difficulty of obtaining signatures from 
suppliers who are from different regions delayed the submission of POs; and 

 Absence of duly designated focal person who are in-charge in gathering/ 
compiling perfected contracts and its supporting documents. 

 
25.5 Due to delays/non-submission of contract documents, the timely review/evaluation 

and determination of the reasonableness of the contract cost and defects on the 
contracts cannot be readily undertaken and communicated to Management for 
appropriate action/remedies, which could lead to audit suspension/disallowance of 
related disbursements due to documentary deficiencies/legal infirmities not addressed 
beforehand, that is, after the review process and before the post audit of disbursements. 
 

25.6 We recommended that Management strictly comply with COA Circular No. 
2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 by submitting to the Audit Team the 

infrastructure/non-infrastructure contracts and POs within the prescribed 

period of five (5) working days from its execution to prevent undue delay in the 

review thereof and the consequential issuance of Notice of Suspension/ 

Disallowance in the post audit of disbursements. 
 



183 
 

25.7 Management has agreed and expressed their commitment to comply with the audit 
recommendations of submitting contract documents/POs within the prescribed 
timelines. Below are the actions taken by Management in compliance thereof: 
 
 The Offices of Ilocos Sur 1st DEO, Palawan 3rd DEO and Surigao del Sur 1st 

DEO designated additional personnel to address the insufficiency of manpower 
in the unit and oversee the prompt submission of contracts. 

 BAC/Construction Division of Regional Office III stated that 23 infrastructure 
contracts with total project cost of P2,487,892,680.67 were already submitted to 
the COA Office on various dates of February and March 2021. 

 Offices of Pampanga 2nd and 3rd DEOs already submitted all the

vouchers and supporting documents in the aggregate amount of 

P106,902,299,241.50 to the Office of the Auditor contrary to Section 122 of PD 

No. 1445 and Section 7.2 (a) of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15,

the exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it 
require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing 
officers, administrative or personnel officers and other responsible officials of the 
various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory report, current plantilla 
of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its 
functions.” Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents and 
reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of payment of their 
salaries until they shall have complied with the requirements of the Commission.

their salaries until they shall have complied with the requirements.

26.6 From the foregoing, the Auditor was precluded from performing timely validation and 
substantive tests necessary to ascertain the validity, propriety and accuracy of the 
recorded transactions in the financial statements. Late submission of the monthly paid 
vouchers and supporting documents resulted in delays in the post-audit and analysis 
of transactions. 
 

26.7 We recommended that the Management: 
 

a) require all agency officials/personnel concerned to strictly comply with the 
pertinent rules and regulations on the submission of financial 

reports/records including all supporting documents thereof within the 

prescribed deadlines to ensure that all transactions are recorded in the 

period when those transactions have transpired; and 

 

b) enforce the penal provision on withholding of salaries of responsible officers 
in case of unjustified failure on their part to submit the reports on time. 

 
 
Gender and Development (GAD) Program 

 

27. The Department was not able to submit within the reglementary period the 
Annual Gender and Development Plan and Budget (AGDPB) and its GAD 



187 
 

Accomplishment Report (AR) to the COA Audit Team as required under COA 

Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014. 

 

27.1 Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 provides that “The audited agency shall submit 
a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (AGPB) to the COA Audit Team assigned 
to the agency within five (5) working days from the receipt of the approved plan from 
the PCW of their mother or central offices, as the case maybe.  Likewise, a copy of the 
corresponding Accomplishment Report shall be furnished the said Audit Team within 
five (5) working days from the end of January of the preceding year”. 
 

27.2 The Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) has endorsed the Department’s AGPB 
CY 2020 on March 25, 2021.  This PCW-endorsed GAD Plan should have been 
submitted five working days from the receipt of the approved plan from PCW in 
accordance with the abovementioned COA Circular. However, upon verification of 
the records, the AGPB was still not submitted to the Audit Team despite the said report 
was already indorsed by the PCW. 
 

27.3 On the other hand, the GAD Accomplishment Report has not been submitted to the 
Auditor’s Office as of Report date. Per inquiry with the Member Secretariat, the 
Accomplishment Report was not submitted to the Audit Team on the required deadline 
pursuant to the above-cited COA Circular because other Regional/District Offices 
GAD ARs had not been inputted in the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System 
(GMMS).  
 

27.4 Also, the Audit Team has noted that no separate monitoring for the GAD ARs was 
maintained aside from the GMMS. Hence the GAD accomplishments cannot be 
verified nor validated to determine whether the GAD’s priority thrusts would be 
attained. As of audit report date, both the AGPB and GAD ARs have not yet been 
submitted to the Audit Team. 
 

27.5 Moreover, verification of the extent of preparation of GAD programs and its 
implementation to various DPWH Regional/District Offices showed the following 
observations/deficiencies:

27.6 We recommended that the Management of DPWH OSEC require the GAD Focal 

Person to submit the approved Annual Gender and Development Plan and 

Budget and its GAD Accomplishment Report to the COA Audit Team within the 

period as prescribed in Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001. 
 

27.7 We also recommended that Management of the Offices concerned to: 
 

a) establish a functional GFPS which shall spearhead the timely preparation 
of the annual and performance-based GPB, send the members of the GFPS 

to capacity building and seminars related to GAD mechanisms/processes, 

and require the GAD Focal Person to submit on time the GPB to the Offices 

concerned;  

 

b) institutionalize the use of the HGDG templates through capacity training 
for the proper assessment of infrastructure and related facilities to properly 

evaluate development interventions to contribute on the achievement of the 

organizational goals/outcomes; 

 

c) facilitate the conduct of gender analysis for proper identification of gender-
responsive PAPs in the GPB and GAD AR; 

 

d) capacitate the GAD focal person in order to enhance her skills in the 
preparation of proper and realistic GPB and GAD AR, through the use of 

correct HGDG toolkit in its evaluation, in accordance with the requirement 

of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01; and 

 

e) ensure prompt and full completion/accomplishment of GAD projects within 
the budget year and require the GAD Focal Person to periodically monitor 

GAD projects and report on the results so that project implementation 

challenges are immediately determined and acted upon, as well as to 

provide technical assistance to the GAD responsible offices, if warranted. 

 

27.8 In DPWH OSEC, Management explained that the DPWH GPB FY2020 was endorsed 
by the PCW on March 25, 2021, but due to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases 
in the Planning Service as well as in the DPWH Central Office, a thorough disinfection 
was undertaken on March 26 to 27, 2021. Also due to the constraints and limitation 
brought about by placing the entire NCR under ECQ, the endorsed GPB FY2020 was 
not submitted on time. They stated further that GFPS avows to be more prudent and 
compliant and that an on-time submission of the approved GPB will be observed. 
 

27.9 Likewise, the Audit Team was informed that the GAD Accomplishment Report FY 
2020 was not submitted due to delay in the uploading of GAD AR to the Gender 
Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) of the PCW. The submission of GAD 



190 
 

AR is dependent on the PCW controlled GMMS and PCW’s endorsement. They stated 
further that the GFPS is in constant coordination with PCW for the 
uploading/submission of GAD AR in the GMMS. 
 
 

Senior Citizens and Differently-Abled Persons 
 
28. Several DPWH offices were not able to integrate and implement plans and 

projects, and allocate funds that address the needs of senior citizens and 

differently-abled persons pursuant to Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA 

No. 11465 or the GAA of FY 2020. 

 

28.1 Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 or the GAA of FY 2020 
provides that all government agencies shall formulate plans, programs and projects 
intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, relative 
to their mandates, and integrate the same in their regular activities. Moreover, all 
government infrastructures and facilities shall provide architectural or structural 
features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and 
welfare of persons with disability. 
 

28.2 For CY 2020, NCR DEOs (MMIIDEO and QCIIDEO) and Region IX DEOs 
(Zamboanga City, Isabela City, Zamboanga del Sur 1st and Zamboanga del Sur 2nd 
DEOs) were not able to integrate plans, programs and projects to address the concerns 
of senior citizen due to the absence of a focal person and non-allocation of funds for 
this purpose as required under Section 32 of FY 2020 GAA thus, depriving these 
sectors from the benefits therefrom. 
 

28.3 On the other hand, DPWH Regional and District Offices in CAR, I, II, IV-A (except 
Cavite 3rd DEO), V, VI (only Iloilo City DEO and Guimaras DEO), VII, XII and NCR 
RO/DEOs (LPMDEO, MMIIIDEO, MNDEO, NMDEO, QCIDEO and SMDEO), 
formulated plans and programs to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons 
with disability and has integrated the same in their regular activities thus, senior 
citizens’ concerns were addressed and the welfare, safety and mobility of persons with 
disability were considered. 
 

28.4 We recommended that Management continue to formulate plans, programs, 
projects and activities that address the needs of the senior citizens and differently-

abled persons and integrate the same in their regular activities. 
 

 

Uninsured properties and equipment – P1.067 billion 
 

29. Various properties and equipment of 21 DPWH Regional and District Offices 
amounting to P1,067,090,564.84 are not sufficiently/ adequately insured with the 

General Insurance Funds (GIF), as required under RA No. 656, thus, exposing 

the Agency to unnecessary losses due to non-indemnification in the event of 



191 
 

damage caused by calamities such as earthquake, storm, flood, theft and other 

causes beyond the insurance limits.  

 

29.1 Republic Act No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law, expresses that: 
 
 Section 2. In order to indemnify or compensate the Government as defined in 

this Act for any damage to, or loss of its properties due to fire, earthquake, storm 
or other casualty, there is established the “Property Insurance Fund”, which shall 
consist of all moneys resulting from the liquidation of the insurance constituted 
in section three hundred forty of the Revised Administrative Code and from 
premiums and other incomes. 

 
 Section 5. Every Government, except a municipal government below first class, 

is hereby required to insure its properties, with the Fund against any insurable 
risk herein provided and pay the premiums thereon, which, however, shall not 
exceed the premiums charged by private insurance companies. Provided, 
however, that the system reserves the right to disapprove the whole or a portion 
of the amount of insurance applied for. Provided, further, That such property or 
part thereof as may not be insurable or acceptable for insurance may be insured 
with any private insurance company. Xxx 

 
 Section 11. Each government as defined herein shall include in its annual 

appropriation the amount necessary to cover the premiums for the insurance of 
its properties during each fiscal period and remit the same immediately to the 
System as provided in Section 10 thereof. 

 

29.2 Likewise, COA Circular 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018, provides guidelines 
prescribing the submission of Property Inventory Form as basis for the assessment of 
general insurance coverage over all assets, properties and interests of the government 
with the GIF of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS). 
 

29.3 Section 5 of the same Circular provides that the Head of the agency shall direct 
pertinent official under his/her supervision to: (i) Secure directly from the GSIS, GIF, 
all insurances or bonds covering properties, contracts, rights of action and other 
insurable risks of their respective offices; (ii) Prepare the Property Inventory Form 
(PIF) listing of all the insurable properties and other assets, showing their latest 
appraised values; (iii) Extract from the RPCPPE, as well as from the RPCI, prepared 
in accordance with the provisions of the GAM for NGAs, the date for the PIF 
pertaining to insurable assets and interest of the government (excluding impaired 
properties for disposal); (iv) Cause the appraisal of the insurable properties and other 
assets of their respective offices. For this purpose, an in-house appraisal shall be 
sufficient if the property or insurable interest has a value of 10 million and below. 
Otherwise, an independent appraisal shall be necessary; (v) Submit the consolidated 
PIF to the Supervising Auditor/ Audit Team Leader and the GIF, GSIS, not later than 
April 30 of each year; and (vi) Include in the agency annual budget the amount of 



192 
 

premiums for the general insurance covering all insurable properties and other assets 
and ensure its payment to the GSIS.

29.6 The absence and inadequacy of insurance of real and other property of the DPWH 
Regional/District Offices to cover all insurable physical assets and property with the 
GSIS GIF exposed the agency to unnecessary losses and/or could result in non-
recovery of the value of the property in case of any damage to, or loss due to fire, 
earthquake, storm, or other fortuitous event and force majeure. 
 

29.7 As cited by DEOs in Region III, the common causes of non-insurance of the Districts’ 
properties, are (a) failure or omission of the Property Officer to prepare the PIF listing 
all the insurable properties and other assets and showing their latest appraised values, 
and (b) non-updating of the PIF that excluded the other insurable items in the coverage. 
 

29.8 We recommended that DPWH Regional Offices direct the designated Property 
Custodian to prepare and submit the PIF and acquire insurance of all its 

insurable assets with the GIF of the GSIS against any insurable risk pursuant to 

RA No. 656 to ensure that the government will be secured or indemnified for any 

damage or loss of properties.  
 

29.9 The DPWH offices concerned commented as follows: 
 

Table 57-A Management Comment per Office 
Region  Office    Comment/s  

II Nueva 
Viscaya 1st 
DEO 

The Supply and Property Management Unit has already prepared the 
supporting documents for the application of insurance for CY 2021, 
covering various properties and equipment of the DEO and informed that 
payment will be made as soon as funds for the purpose are available. 

 Isabela 4th 
DEO 

The Property Officer concerned has been notified about compliance with 
RA No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law and agreed 
to comply with the COA recommendation and committed to submit the 
necessary documents to the Office of the Auditor. 

III Regional 
Office 

The Supply and Property Management Section committed that the Office 
shall adhere to COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018.  They 
also stated that they are currently coordinating with the Bureau of 
Equipment, DPWH Head Office relative to the watercrafts they 
transferred to DPWH RO No. III. According to them, such equipment was 
being insured with the GSIS annually. They further state that the physical 
count of PPE to be conducted starting March 15, 2021, will enable the 
Office to identify the number of heavy equipment that are operational and 
will subsequently be insured with GSIS.  However, the heavy equipment 



194 
 

Region  Office    Comment/s  

to be tagged as unserviceable will be dropped from their respective 
accounts and shall no longer require insurance. 

 Bataan 2nd 
DEO 

The Property Officer commented during the exit conference that she was 
made aware of the form only this year. Nevertheless, she assured the Audit 
Team that the PIF will be prepared and submitted to GIF of GSIS within 
the prescribed period. 

 Bulacan 1st 
DEO 

The Chief of Human Resource and Administrative Section who was in-
charge of insurance of the District’s properties, as well as the 
Property/Supply Officer, assured their full compliance with the 
recommendations made.  As of date, they are already preparing the 
insurance application of the insurable assets such as Construction Heavy 
Equipment and the Technical and Scientific Equipment. 

 Nueva Ecija 
2nd DEO 

Management commented that the buildings were recognized in the books 
of the agency only last December 2020, thus, they are still in the process 
of coordinating with the GSIS for the insurance of said properties. 

 Zambales 1st 
DEO 

The Property Officer and other officials concerned stated that not all PPEs 
are insurable and they are not familiar with COA Circular No. 2018-002 
which prescribes the submission of PIF.  However, they assured the Audit 
Team that they will provide the said report for proper identification of 
insurable properties. 

 Zambales 2nd 
DEO 

Property Officer will update the PIF upon disposal of the unserviceable 
properties. 

IV-A Laguna 3rd 
DEO 

The Supply Officer reasoned out that the failure to renew their insurable 
physical assets, properties and equipment was due to community 
quarantine amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, as recommended 
Management already submitted their request to GSIS PIF. 

VI DEOs Management explained that they were not able to account for all insurable 
properties, hence, the listing of all insurable properties which should be 
submitted to the Office of the Auditor not later than April 30 of each year 
as required under COA Circular No. 2018-002 was not complied. 

 
 
Compliance with GSIS Act of 1997

premium payments (optional, pre-need and other non-life insurance) and other 
amounts due the GSIS within the first ten (10) days of the calendar month following 
the month to which the contributions apply.”

32.3 The Accounting Division and the Cash Division, DPWH OSEC, are still in the process 
of verification and reconciliation of the account balances to determine the causes of 
the prior years’ unremitted accounts specifically the contributions deducted from the 
salaries of daily-wage personnel who availed early retirement during the 
implementation of the Department Rationalization Plan. 
 

32.4 Nevertheless, failure to remit withheld contributions timely, exposes the Department 
to imposition of penalties and interests for delayed/non-remittances of premium 
contributions to PhilHealth.  
 

32.5 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) strictly enforce remittance of premiums withheld to PhilHealth within the 
prescribed period as provided under Section 18.b of the RIRR of the 

National Health Insurance Act of 2013 to avoid incurrence of penalties and 

interest, as well as, prevent exposing the employees/beneficiaries to the risks 

that they could not enjoy the health benefits of the program; and 

b) require the Accounting Division and Cash Division to expedite the analysis, 
validation and reconciliation of the recorded prior years’ balances which 

are long outstanding for more than three (3) years particularly 

contributions withheld from the salaries of the daily wage personnel. 

 

 
Compliance with Tax Laws

35.3 Management had previously commented that it had sent demand letters to NGAs and 

LGUs concerned for the immediate liquidation of the fund transfers. However, to date, 
the aforementioned balances remained outstanding.  
 

35.4 We recommended that Management create an Inspectorate Team to validate 
whether the purposes of the fund transfers were complied with; and make 

representation to NGAs and LGUs concerned to reconcile and determine the 

correct balances of unliquidated funds transferred, if any. 
 

35.5 Management has already created an Inspectorate Team and has started planning and 
gathering documents to comply with the recommendation. 

 
 
Report on the Utilization of Funds for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Funds  
 

36. Seven (7) provisions of RA No. 9184 and its RIRR, and RA No. 11494 “Bayanihan 
to Recover as One Act” were not observed and/or complied with, in the 

implementation of infrastructure projects related to COVID-19 funds in the total 

amount of P684,897,743.29. Out of that funds allocated amounting to 

P4,393,014,250.94, a total of 478 quarantine facilities/offsite dormitories/ 

evacuation centers with 17,843 beds were completed, while constructions of 229 

health facilities with 7,368 beds are still on-going status. Moreover, other 

procedural deficiencies/lapses were likewise observed in the audit of the said 

funds. 

 

36.1 Pursuant to RA No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act approved on March 
24, 2020, and RA No. 11494 or the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act approved on 
September 11, 2020, a state of national health emergency was declared, which granted 
the President the powers and authority necessary to carry out urgent measures to meet 
the adverse effect and serious threat of COVID-19 to public’s health safety, security 
and livelihood.  
 

36.2 In view of the national health emergency, the DPWH which functions as the 
engineering and construction arm of the Government was tasked pursuant to Section 
4 of RA No. 11469 and Section 8.c of RA No. 11494 to construct temporary medical 
isolation and quarantine facilities, field hospitals, dormitories for front liners and for 
the expansion of government hospital capacity all over the country, as response to 
COVID-19. Likewise, they are also enjoined to conduct measures for disinfection 
services and other COVID-19 prevention activities on their respective Offices.  
 



203 
 

36.3 Section 10 (r.1) of RA No. 11494 provides P1,000,000,000.00, for the Tourism Road 
Infrastructure of the Program (TRIP) of DPWH and DOT, intended for the 
construction, upgrading, rehabilitation, and improvement of roads and bridges leading 
to tourism destinations areas. 
 

36.4 Under RA No. 11494, the promotion of active transportation was strengthened by the 
declaration of the bicycle as an additional mode of transportation and the provision of 
funding to support the establishment of bike lane networks. Considering that RA No. 
11494 is an economic stimulus and recovery law, the DOTr jointly with the DPWH, 
prioritized the establishment of these bike lane networks in the country’s metropolitan 
areas – Metro Cebu, Davao, and Manila where economic activities are the highest, in 
a project called Metropolitan Bikelane Network.  
 

36.5 RA No. 9184 and its RIRR otherwise known as the “Government Procurement Reform 
Act,” prescribes the necessary rules and regulations for the modernization, 
standardization, and regulation of the procurement activities of the Government of the 
Philippines. 
 

36.6 To expedite the efforts of different government agencies to respond to the challenges 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government Policy Procurement Board (GPPB) has 
issued several resolutions and circulars facilitating faster and simpler procurement 
policies in this extraordinary time. Some of the most relevant issuances were GPPB 
Circular 01-2020 dated April 6, 2020, which contains the guidelines for Emergency 
Procurement under the RA No. 11469, on which the procuring entity are allowed to 
resort to Negotiated Procurement (Emergency Cases) for its procurement until June 
23, 2020.  
 

36.7 On the other hand, GPPB Resolution No. 18-2020 dated September 16, 2020, provides 
the rules on the conduct of procurement activities under RA No. 11494, which now 
requires the use of competitive procurement procedure. 
 

36.8 As of December 31, 2020, the DPWH received funds from the DBM totaling 
P6,415,255,733.45 in response to COVID-19, sourced from the  Quick Response Fund 
(QRF)/National Disaster Risk and Reduction Management (NDRRM) Funds and RA 
No. 11494. Of the total amount, P5,351,532,357.04 was obligated and leaving a

b) Delayed implementation of infrastructure projects  
 

36.13 In Pampanga 1st DEO, evaluation of the status of implementation of three (3) DPWH 
Standard One (1) Storey Health Facilities Container Van in Mexico, Pampanga with 
contract cost of P37,590,626.13 disclosed that the projects were not finished nor 
completed within the specific contract time or required completion date.  The project 
has a contract duration of 30 calendar days, with starting date of November 19, 2020 
and target completion date of December 18, 2020.  However, per ocular inspection 
conducted by the Audit Team on January 8, 2021, the project was still on-going and 
estimated to have only 70.00 percent completion rate.    

 

c) Idle and non-functional isolation facilities 
 

36.14 In Bulacan 1st DEO, two (2) units Isolation Facility constructed beside the Malolos 
Sports and Convention Center, City of Malolos, Bulacan with contract cost of 
P28,106,313.14, although reported 100 percent completed as of September 8, 2020 
was verified idle and non-functional during an ocular inspection conducted by the 
Audit Team in December 2020. Inquiry made by the Audit Team with the LGU 
personnel assigned at the facility area disclosed that there was no electricity provided 
so they could not accept patients in the facility at the moment. 
 

36.15 Verification of the MOA between the DPWH Regional Director and the incumbent 
City Mayor of Malolos disclosed that one of the provisions indicated therein was the 
responsibility of the LGU to provide for the operational expenses of the facility, which 



208 
 

implied that electricity is among the basic operational expenses to make it functional.  
Such deficiency defeated the purpose of the fund released to implement projects that 
could help mitigate the spread of the virus by providing isolation facilities for COVID-
19 patients.  

 

d) Delayed/non-submission of infrastructure contracts and purchase orders 
 

36.16 There were noted delays or non-submission of 11 infrastructure contracts/POs 
amounting to P70,802,737.02, including the relevant documents, by five DPWH 
offices contrary to paragraph 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 
2009.

36.17 Due to delays/non-submission of contract documents, the timely review/evaluation 
and determination of the reasonableness of the contract cost and defects on the 
contracts cannot be readily undertaken and communicated to Management for 
appropriate action/remedies. 

 

e) Disbursements for the procurement of good and projects not properly supported 
 

36.18 Section 4 of PD No. 1445 or the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines 
provides the fundamental principles, among others: the disbursements or disposition 
of government funds or property shall invariably bear the approval of the proper 
officials, and claims against government funds shall be supported with complete 
documentation. 
 

36.19 Section 53.2 and Annex H of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 provide the instances and 
specific procedures when Negotiated Procurement under Emergency Cases may be 
resorted to. 
 

36.20 Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Resolution No. 03-2020 dated March 
9, 2020, approved the adoption of efficient, effective and expedient procurement 
procedures during a state of public health emergency. Likewise, GPPB Resolution No. 
05-2020 dated March 20, 2020, was issued to allow the Procuring Entities (PEs) to 
accept: (i) an expired Business or Mayor’s Permit with Official Receipt for the renewal 
application, subject to submission of the Business or Mayor’s Permit after award of 
the contract; and (ii) an unnotarized OSS, subject to compliance therewith after award 
of the contract under the Negotiated Procurement (Emergency Cases) modality. 
 



209 
 

36.21 Further, DPWH DO No. 125 on August 5, 2015,  set the limit of the cumulative amount 
for progress billing to be collected by a contractor, solely for financial 
accomplishment, in the case of locally-funded projects, to a maximum percentage of 
the total contract amount of the project – above P100 million – 95 percent and P100 
million and below – 90 percent.  
 

36.22 In NCR-MMIIDEO, audit of payments/disbursements made on the procurement of 
goods and implementation for the Rehabilitation of Disaster-Related Infrastructure 
and Other Related Facilities in order to intensify/augment the response efforts to public 
health emergency due to COVID-19 disease showed several lacking documentary 
requirements and other deficiencies contrary to the aforementioned guidelines:

36.23 We recommended that Management instruct the: 
 

a) Offices concerned, through the BAC,  to strictly conform with the provisions 
of RA No. 9184 and its RIRR, and all applicable procurement laws, rules 

and regulations in all stages of the procurement of goods and infrastructure 

projects related to COVID-19 response, and comply with the timely 

completion of the entire procurement process to preclude any issues that 

may arise upon implementation of the projects; 

 

b) Project Engineers and Project Inspectors of the Pampanga 1st DEO, who 
agreed to religiously monitor the implementation of the projects, to ensure 

completion in accordance with the plans and specifications and within the

d) District Engineer of NCR-MMIIDEO to ensure reports and documents are 
properly signed, and submit the required lacking documentary 

requirements and explanation/justification on the noted deficiencies. 

 

36.24 Several DPWH offices were compliant with the provisions of the RA No. 9184 and 
other applicable procurement laws, rules and regulations since they followed the 
required mode of procurement, observed the timely procurement of the programmed 
healthcare facilities as response to COVID-19, and submitted completely the required 
supporting documents.  
 

36.25 The mode of procurement infused with COVID-19 Funds for the following DPWH 
offices, significantly complied with the RIRR of RA No. 9184 and all applicable 
procurement laws, rules and regulations; and was duly supported with complete 
mandatory documents. No adverse audit observations were noted.

was able to implement the three (3) projects within the set deadlines. The timely 
procurement of these projects despite the restrictions in personnel movement, 
problems in logistics and imposition of stringent quarantine restrictions, benefitted the 
government in providing timely services to the public and helped in responding to the 
challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.

disclosed that the contracts were not submitted to the Audit Team within five (5) days 
from the date of execution of the contracts.  
 

38.6 Moreover, incomplete submission of supporting documents was noted in the auditorial 
and legal review of the three (3) contracts contrary to Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular 
No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 which defeated the very purpose for the 
promulgation of the aforementioned regulations and also precluded the conduct of a 
systematic and effective review process with a view of generating timely and relevant 
audit results. 
 

38.7 We recommended that the Management should submit the required documents duly 
authenticated as exact copies of the original and justifications on the noted deficiency 
on delayed submission of contracts. 
 

38.8 On October 12, 2020, Management submitted the complete set of duly authenticated 
documents together with their justifications to which the Audit Team acknowledged 
and rendered no further comments.
