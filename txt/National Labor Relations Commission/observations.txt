PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

Accounting Errors and Omissions 

  

1. A total misstatement of ₱12,413,537.95 was found in the audit of Cash and Cash 
Equivalents, Inventories, Property, Plant and Equipment, and Liabilities 

accounts of the NLRC Central Office (CO) and Regional Arbitration Branches 

(RABs) due to accounting errors and omissions which significantly affected the 

fair presentation of its financial statements (FSs) as at December 31, 2020. 

 

1.1 Section 15, Chapter 2, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual 
(GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) states that “The financial 

statements (FSs) shall present fairly the financial position, financial 

performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the 

faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and 

conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for 

assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in Philippine Public Sector 

Accounting Standards (PPSAS).1” 

 

1.2 Moreover, Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that 
the accounts of the agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet 

the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the 

information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. 

 

1.3 Audit of the various accounts in the NLRC’s consolidated FSs as of December 
31, 2020 disclosed total uncorrected misstatements/errors of ₱12,413,537.95, 

as shown below:

1.4 The details of the misstatements which the Management did not adjust in their 
books of accounts as at yearend and the corresponding specific 

recommendations are discussed further in the succeeding paragraphs. 

 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
 

a) Misstatement in Cash and Cash Equivalents Accounts - ₱12,009,926.21 
 

1.5 The reported year-end balance of the Cash and Cash Equivalents account in 
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position amounting to 

₱3,160,481,545.37 had a total overstatement of ₱12,009,926.21, as detailed 

below:

a.1 Overstatement of CIB-LCCA - ₱12,010,425.31 
  

1.6 The Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) as of December 31, 2020 on the 
Fiduciary Award (LBP-Trust Account) in CO and NCRAB showed that the 

book balance is more than the bank balance by ₱13,562,529.63, which was 

not confirmed existing by the bank. As per BRS, the difference consists of the 

unreconciled amount between the books and the bank balance since October 

2010. The unaddressed corrections/adjustment/further verification of the 

identified reconciling items for considerably long period of time defeated the 

objectives/purposes for preparing the BRS, pursuant to Section 3, Chapter 21, 

Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. The non-existent cash in bank renders the 

book balance overstated by such amount, hence affects the reliability of the 

Cash and Cash Equivalents account balance in the FS. 

 



45 
 

1.7 Moreover, Section 56, Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides 
that: 

 

A Schedule of Unreleased Commercial Checks shall be prepared by 

the Cashier for submission to the Accounting Division/Unit. All 

unreleased checks at the end of the year shall be reverted back to the 

Cash accounts. A JEV shall be prepared to recognize the restoration 

of the cash equivalent to the unreleased checks and the recognition of 

the appropriate liability/payable account. The accounting entry for the 

restoration of the unreleased check to the cash account shall be a debit 

to “Cash in Bank, Local Currency Current Account” with credit to the 

appropriate liability account. There shall be no physical cancellation 

of the checks. The JEV supporting such restoration shall form part of 

the supporting document to the financial statements to be submitted to 

COA at yearend. At the start of the ensuing year, another JEV shall be 

drawn to reverse the previous entry made and recognize the 

availability of the checks for release. This procedure shall not apply 

to account “Cash-Modified Disbursement System (MDS)” since there 

is no actual cash with the GSBs. 
 

1.8 Audit of the CIB-LCCA account likewise disclosed cancelled/stale/ 
unreleased commercial checks, with an aggregate amount of ₱1,552,104.32, 

that were not restored to Cash. Details are as follows:

1.9 Review of the BRSs of CO and NCRAB under the Fiduciary Award (UCPB) 
(146-109566-1)/(001-460015724) account revealed that the Accounting Unit 

misinterpreted entries made by the bank on the offsetting of returned checks 

with cleared checks. Instead of recording the return of checks, the Accounting 

Unit marked them as bank overstatement. Consequently, the CIB-LCCA 

account balance is understated by ₱611,578.25. Details of the canceled checks 

are as follows: 

 
Table No. 2.2: Unrestored Cancelled Checks in the CIB-LCCA Account

Total      611,578.25  



46 
 

 

1.10 Furthermore, stale check amounting to ₱777.55 was also noted as unadjusted 
in the books of the CO and NCRAB which contributed to the understatement 

of the CIB-LCCA account in its books of accounts. 

 

1.11 Meanwhile, Cashiers in RABs VI and VIII reported unreleased checks 
amounting to ₱233,449.27 and ₱706,299.25, respectively. However, no 

adjusting journal entries were made for the restoration thereof to the CIB-

LCCA and appropriate Liability accounts which likewise understated the 

CIB-LCCA account balance by a total of ₱939,748.52. 

 

a.2 Understatement of CIB-FCSA - ₱499.10 
 

1.12 The reconciling item which caused the difference in the book and bank 
balances of the CIB-FCSA account in CO and NCRAB amounting to $10.39 

or ₱499.10, as converted using the spot rate of ₱48.036 as of December 31, 

2020, was only reflected in the December BRS. It pertains to unremitted 

collection or deposit in transit for monetary judgment award on March 2, 2020 

which should have been added to the CIB-FCSA account balance instead of 

deducting the same. 

 

1.13 We recommended that the Management direct the Accountants of the 
concerned Offices/RABs to: 

 

a. recognize all reconciling items in the BRSs that require 
correction/adjustment in the books to reflect the correct balance of 

the Cash in Bank and other affected accounts; 

 

b. fast-track/facilitate the verification of the long-standing 
overstatement in the Cash in Bank  (Fiduciary Award-LBP Trust 

account) in CO and NCRAB amounting to ₱13,562,529.63 and take 

up the necessary adjustments/corrections to reflect the correct 

balance of the said Cash in Bank account; 

 

c. make representation with the concerned bank to immediately correct 
the bank errors noted in the last BRSs; and 

 

d. prepare the necessary correcting entries to record the 
cancelled/unreleased commercial checks and undeposited collections 

to reflect the correct balance of the affected Cash and Cash 

Equivalents accounts. 

 

1.14 The Management comments are as follows: 
 

Office/RAB Management Comments/Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

CO and NCR The Management commented that the discrepancy between the book 

and bank balance of CIB-LCCA [Fiduciary Award (LBP-Trust 



47 
 

Office/RAB Management Comments/Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

Account)] of ₱13,562,529.63 pertains to prior years, mostly 2006 and 

older which either does not have complete or lacks documentation. 

Nevertheless, it expressed its commitment to continue to verify this 

reconciling amount. 

 

Further, the Management claimed that there was no cancellation of the 

total amount of ₱611,578.25 per book as of December 31, 2020 since 

the actual checks issued were not yet returned to the Agency by the bank 

or by the payee. It only noticed the offsetting of issued and possibly 

dishonored but unreturned check in the bank statements during the bank 

reconciliation. In the meantime that it needs more information on the 

adjustment, it reported the said amount under bank reconciling items on 

December 31, 2020. On May 11, 2021, it cancelled the corresponding 

checks under JEV No. 2021-05-214.  

 

As regards the collection of judgment award of ₱499.10 ($10.39) on 

March 2, 2020, this was properly recorded under JEV No. 2020-03-115-

I as Other Service Income at its peso equivalent of ₱538.41 at the date 

of collection. However, it did not remit the said amount because the 

Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) does not have a bank account for 

collections stated in foreign currencies. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

 

JEV No. 2021-05-214 and its supporting documents will be verified by 

the Audit Team upon its submission. The Audit Team in CO and 
NCRAB insisted that the undeposited collection should be added back 

to the CIB-FCSA account to reflect its accurate yearend balance. Record 

the deduction of the same only upon actual remittance to the BTr. 

VI The Management commented that their newly appointed Cashier, 

Acting Accountant and all concerned personnel in the RAB are in the 

process of reconciling their records. A report will be submitted as soon 

the reconciliation is complete. 

VIII The Management noted the audit observations and recommendations, 

and committed to prepare a Summary of Unreleased Checks at the end 

of the year, and to prepare adjusting journal entry to record the 

restoration of the unreleased checks to the CIB-LCCA account. 

 

INVENTORIES 

 

b) Misstatement in Inventories Account - ₱4,344.11 
 

1.15 The balance of Inventories accounts as at December 31, 2020 was misstated 
by ₱4,344.11 due to the following error:

1.16 Section 112 of PD No. 1445 provides that “Each government agency shall 
record its financial transactions and operations conformably with generally 

accepted accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws and 

regulations.” 

  

1.17 It was observed in RAB VIII that Other Supplies and Materials Inventory 
totaling ₱4,344.11 remained recorded as Office Supplies Inventory even after 

issuance thereof to end-users. Hence, the Office Supplies Inventory account 

was overstated while the Other Supplies and Materials  Expenses account is 

understated by ₱4,344.11, as shown in detail below:

1.18 We recommended that Management of RAB VIII direct the Accounting

balance of the Inventories account. 

 

1.19 The Management of RAB VIII agreed with the audit observation and 
committed to comply with the recommendation. 

 

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PPE) 
 

c) Misstatement in PPE accounts – ₱84,978.84 
 

1.20 The following are the misstatements found in the audit of various PPE 
accounts balances and transactions, which the Management did not adjust in 

their books of accounts:

c.1 Unrecorded PPE   
 

1.21 The Audit Teams in RABs CAR and XI conducted a random physical count 
of the PPE. It was found that there were equipment that were not recorded in 

the books of accounts under the PPE account as of yearend. Details are 

presented as follows: 

 
Table 4.1: Unrecorded PPE

XI IT Equipment 142,500.00 

Total 232,772.00 

 

1.22 Verification of these items showed that procurement was done by utilizing 
the balance of the Execution Fund under the Fiduciary Fund. The journal entry 

used in recording the purchase of these items was debit to Trust Liabilities 

account and credit to Cash account for the amount paid to the supplier and 

Due to BIR account for the withheld tax. There was no entry to recognize the 

aforementioned items as PPE. 

 

1.23 The non-recording of the procured assets in the books resulted in the 
understatement of the PPE account by ₱232,772.00. 

 

 

 



50 
 

c.2 Erroneous computation of depreciation expense 
 

1.24 Section 27(i), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs states that “A 
residual value equivalent to at least five percent (5%) of the cost shall be 

adopted unless a more appropriate percentage is determined by the entity 

based on its operation subject to the approval of COA.” 

 

1.25 Audit of the PPE accounts of RAB IX revealed that the net book value of 
Office Equipment, Information and Communication Technology Equipment 

and Motor Vehicles accounts are overstated by ₱94,397.20, ₱35,408.58 and 

₱17,134.13, respectively. 

 

1.26 Upon verification, the misstatements were due to errors in the computation of 
depreciation expenses because of the Management’s adoption of 10 percent 

residual value without justification and prior approval from COA instead of 

the five percent residual value, as prescribed under Section 27(i), Chapter 10, 

Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. 

 

1.27 The current and prior years’ erroneous computation of depreciation expense 
of the abovementioned PPE accounts resulted in the overstatement and 

understatement of the following accounts:

c.3 Non-derecognition of disposed PPE 
 

1.28 Section 40(d), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that PPE 
reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting 

Impairment Loss - Property, Plant, and Equipment. The Instructions portion 

of the IIRUP form, as prescribed in Appendix 74, Volume III of the GAM for 

NGAs, provides that the IRRUP shall be submitted to the Accounting Unit 



51 
 

after the disposal is completed. It also provides that the original copy of the 

report shall be the basis for adjusting the accounts affected by means of a JEV. 

 

1.29 As of December 31, 2020, the RAB CAR had in its books an Information and 
Communication Technology Equipment costing ₱17,065.00 with 

corresponding Accumulated Depreciation of ₱16,211.75. It was sold on 

February 5, 2020, under Official Receipt No. 4946888.  

 

1.30 Verification of the PPELCs disclosed that the item was still included in the 
Information and Communication Technology Equipment account, thus 

rendering the balance of the said account and its related Accumulated 

Depreciation account overstated by ₱17,065.00 and ₱16,211.75, respectively. 

Consequently, the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit account is overstated by 

₱853.25.  

 

1.31 We recommended that the Management of RABs IX, XI and CAR 
recognize all corrections/adjustments in the books to reflect the correct 

balance of the PPE and other affected accounts. 
 

1.32 The Management of RABs IX, XI and CAR agreed with the audit 
observations and committed to comply with the recommendations. 

 

LIABILITIES  
 

d) Misstatement in Liabilities account – ₱314,252.79 
 

1.33 The following are the misstatements found in the audit of Trust Liabilities 
account balances and transactions, which the Management did not adjust in 

their books of accounts:

52 
 

d.1 Incurred obligations for delivered and accepted goods/services not 
recorded as Accounts Payable 

 

1.34 Section 2, Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs defines liabilities as 
firm obligations of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which 

is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying 

economic benefits or service potential.  

 

1.35 Also, Section 2, Chapter 6 of the same Manual defines Accounts Payable as 
valid and legal obligations of NGAs/OUs, for which, goods/services/projects 

have been delivered/rendered/completed and accepted, regardless of the year 

when these obligations were incurred.  

 

1.36 Audit of RAB IX’s FS as of December 31, 2020 showed nil balance of the 
Accounts Payable account. However, disbursements made in January 2021 

amounting to ₱18,226.98 disclosed that services have been rendered and 

accepted in CY 2020 but were unpaid as of yearend. The said amount should 

have been recognized as Accounts Payable in CY 2020, based on the 

aforementioned definitions of Liabilities and Accounts Payable in the GAM 

for NGAs, and should have been reflected in the FS as of yearend. Thus, the 

non-recording of unpaid rendered services resulted in an understatement in 

Accounts Payable and appropriate Expense account/s by ₱18,226.98. 

 

d.2 Obligations for goods and services not yet delivered/rendered recorded 
as Accounts Payable 

 

1.37 Section 37, Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs states that “No 
obligation shall be certified to accounts payable unless the obligation is 

founded on a valid claim that is properly supported by sufficient evidence and 

there is proper authority for its incurrence.” 

 

1.38 Moreover, Item 6.1.2 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-16 dated December 
23, 2013 states that obligations for which goods/services/projects have not yet 

been delivered/rendered/completed by the creditor and accepted by the 

NGA/OU shall not be recorded as A/Ps at the end of the year. These 

obligations shall only be recognized as A/Ps on the date of delivery/rendition/ 

completion and acceptance of the goods/services/projects, regardless of the 

year of incurrence of such obligations. 

 

1.39 Verification of documents relative to the purchases made by the Seventh 
Division reported as Accounts Payable totaling ₱348,351.29 revealed that, 

₱332,479.77 was found to be not supported with billings and/or invoices 

which indicates that services have not been rendered and/or goods have not 

been delivered. 

 



53 
 

1.40 Interview with the Accountant disclosed that in recording Accounts Payable, 
all obligated claims are included thereof, regardless whether the 

goods/services/projects have been delivered/rendered/completed/accepted or 

not. She further stated that she thought that all obligations for the year shall 

be part of the Accounts Payable since by entering into a contract, Seventh 

Division is liable for such. 

 

1.41 The recording of obligations which are not yet due and demandable as 
Accounts Payable overstated the account and its corresponding Expenses 

account by ₱332,479.77, thereby affecting the fair presentation of the FS. 

 

1.42 We recommended that Management of: 
 

a. RAB IX prepare correcting entries to record the amount of goods and 
services already delivered and accepted in the Accounts Payable 

account; and 

 

b. Seventh Division adjust the recorded liabilities without services 
rendered and recognize liabilities in the books of accounts only when 

goods are delivered and services are rendered. 

 

1.43 The Management of RAB IX and Seventh Division agreed with the audit 
observations and will comply with the recommendations accordingly. 

 

 

OTHER ACCOUNTING DEFICIENCIES 

 

2. Variances between accounting records and supporting schedules/documents 
due to lack of reconciliation, existence of dormant account balances, non-

preparation/submission of supporting documents/schedules and 

unsubstantiated adjusting entries affected the reliability, accuracy and 

completeness of the reported balances in Cash and Cash Equivalents, 

Receivables, Inventories, Other Current Assets, PPEs and Liabilities accounts, 

with deficiencies in the aggregate amount of ₱2,791,269,215.06. 

 

2.1 Section 6(e), Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, which enumerates 
the qualitative characteristics of financial reporting, requires an entity to 

present information including accounting policies in a manner that meets 

reliable information which is free from material error and bias and can be 

depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to represent 

or could reasonably be expected to represent. 

 

2.2 Other accounting deficiencies in recording and reporting financial 
transactions were also noted which resulted from lack of reconciliation 

between the books of accounts and schedules/other documents, dormant 

accounts, and non-submission of supporting schedules/other documents to 



54 
 

substantiate the transaction and journal entries made in the books of accounts, 

among others, thereby affecting the reliability, accuracy, completeness, and 

valuation of the reported account balances of the FSs. A summary of the said 

other accounting deficiencies per account is presented in the table below and 

thoroughly discussed in the succeeding paragraphs:

account balances 

 

2.3 Sound internal control on cash requires prompt and correct recording and 
reporting of transactions to ensure that financial information are reliable, 

accurate and reported within the given accounting period. 

 

2.4 As enumerated in Section 3, Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, 
BRS are prepared in order to: 

 

a. check correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s/entity’s records; 
b. serve as a deterrent to fraud; and 
c. enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or credits recognized 

by the bank or agency/entity but not yet known to the agency/entity or 

bank. 

 

2.5 The Cash and Cash Equivalents account balance of ₱3,160,481,545.37 
presented in the NLRC’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of

2.6 Section 40, Chapter 5, Volume I of the GAM for NGAS enumerated the 
detailed procedures for collections and deposits of government funds.  It states 

that the Cash/Treasury Unit Collecting Officer receives cash/check from 

payor representing collection based on the Order of Payment (OP) that will 

be prepared by the Accounting Division/Unit.  The format of an OP and the 

instruction on how to fill up the form is prescribed in Appendix 28, Volume 

II of the GAM for NGAs. The OP is pre-numbered and should be issued in 

numerical sequence.  

  

2.7 Also, Section 4(j), Chapter 2, Volume I of the same Manual states that “Under 
such rules and regulations as the COA and the Department of Finance (DOF) 

may prescribe, the Treasurer of the Philippines and all AGDB shall 

acknowledge receipt of all funds received by them, the acknowledgement 

bearing the date of actual remittance or deposit and indicating from whom 

and on what account it was received. (Sec. 70, PD No. 1445)” 

 

2.8 In NLRC, collections are classified into four types, as follows: 
 

a. Collection of various fees that forms part of the General Fund (GF) of the 
National Government such as Clearance Fees, Certification Fees, Appeal 

Fees and Filing Fees. These are immediately deposited in the United 

Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) – Banawe Branch, NLRC’s duly 

Authorized Government Depository Bank (AGDB). In return, the UCPB 

immediately remits the same to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr), in 

accordance with Section 4(a), Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. 

These fees are duly recorded as Income while the remittance of the same 

to the BTr are duly recorded as Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit-Regular.  

 

b. Collection of cash bonds posted by the respondents and garnishments for 
the satisfaction of monetary awards in labor cases for proper disposition 



56 
 

to parties upon finality of the decision of Labor Arbiters. These collection 

of Judgment Awards forms part of the Agency’s Trust Fund and deposited 

in UCPB, Banawe Branch. The maintenance of this fund was duly 

approved and authorized by the Permanent Committee, pursuant to 

Section 4(c), Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. The collection 

of these trust receipts are duly recorded as Trust Liabilities. 

 

c. Collection of Execution Fees for the payment of the services provided by 
Sheriffs which constitutes the Agency’s Execution Fund. The Accounting 

Unit records the collection of these fees as Trust Liabilities. The 

Execution Fund is also deposited and maintained in UCPB, Banawe 

Branch. 

 

d. Other collections are Documentary Stamp Tax and Legal Research Fees. 
Legal Research Fees are trust receipts collected and transferred to the 

University of the Philippines. Documentary Stamp Taxes are duly 

recorded to Due to BIR account while Legal Research Fees are duly 

recorded under the Due to National Government Agencies account. 

 

2.9 The Agency currently has two modes of collection: (a) collections directly 
deposited to the bank without Official Receipts (OR) with UCPB as its 

collecting agent/depository bank; and (2) collections thru the NLRC Cashier 

which issues ORs.  Prior to the transfer of NLRC-CO to the Ben-Lor Building 

in October 2019, all collections were coursed thru the bank to conform with 

ISO standards. The procedures under the two collection systems are as 

follows: 

 

a.    For the collections thru the bank, NLRC maintained UCPB Banawe 
Branch as its collecting Agent/depository bank considering the proximity 

of the bank to the National Capital Region Arbitration Branch (NCRAB) 

Office.  First, the Cashier in the NCRAB Office issues a copy of a pre-

numbered Order of Payment (OP) to the payor which contains the details 

of the payment. Then, the payor fills out the UCPB payment slip and 

deposit the payment to UCPB, Banawe Branch. Subsequently, a copy of 

the bank-validated payment slip is returned by the payor to the Cashier. 

The bank prepares a Bank Abstract of Daily Collection and Daily 

Summary of Collection to be submitted to NLRC. Based on received bank 

reports, the Accounting Division records the bank collections in the books 

of accounts thru JEV.  

 

b. On the other hand, for collections made thru the Cashier at the Ben-Lor 
Building, the Agency follows the procedures provided in Section 40, 

Chapter 5, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. The Accounting Division 

prepares the OP for the payor. Upon receipt of cash/check from the payor, 

the Cashier issues OR to acknowledge the payment. The Cashier prepares 

the RCD and submits to the Accounting Division together with the 



57 
 

duplicate copy of OR for recording in the books.   

 

2.10 Audit of the collections of NLRC-CO and NCRAB for CY 2020 totalling 
₱751,108,312.87 disclosed missing/unsubmitted OPs to support the RCDs. 

Despite the incomplete available data for audit, the Audit Team requested soft 

copies of the RCDs from the respective Cashiers in order to compare the same 

with the entries made in the CRJ and postings of the affected accounts in the 

respective GLs. The submitted RCDs showed that there are 154 transactions 

from January 3 to March 10, 2020 marked as “Missing OPs” on the RCD for 

the collections without ORs of which, four transactions have blank details on 

the “Payor,” “Amount” and “Nature of Payment” columns. Further, out of the 

154 “Missing OPs,” only ten collections totaling ₱1,617,712.88 have amount 

details, hence casting doubts on whether the transactions with Missing OPs 

were accurate, and whether the issuance of OPs was controlled and accounted 

for. 

 

2.11 Collections for Judgments Awards are liabilities held in trust for eventual 
payment upon resolution of the labor cases, hence identification of the 

particular cases as indicated in the OPs is crucial in the recording of liabilities. 

 

2.12 We recommended that the Management direct the NCRAB Cashier to 
submit the “Missing OPs.”  Henceforth, require him to submit RCDs 

duly reviewed and supported with copies of ORs and OPs to the 

Accounting Division to facilitate the recording of trust liabilities 

particular to each labor case.  

 

2.13 The Management of CO and NCRAB explained that the “Missing OPs” might 
pertain to those issued to payors but have failed to make a deposit to the bank 

on the same day and should be reported instead as “Cancelled OPs” by the 

designated Cashier. They also assured the Audit Team to improve their 

controls on the issuance of OPs as these are considered as accountable forms 

in lieu of the ORs. 

 

2.14 Considering that OPs are accountable forms which the Accountable Officers 
are required to properly maintain, the Audit Team further recommends that 

the Management conduct an investigation on the reported missing OPs taking 

into account the relevance of the said forms in ensuring the reliability of the 

collections reported by the Cashiers in their RCDs, and by the Accounting 

Division, in their preparation of FS and other relevant financial records.  

 

a.2 Unreconciled discrepancy between the balance of Cash-
Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular account in the GL and the amount 

reported in the RCD and CRJ 

 

2.15 The Audit Team observed an unreconciled discrepancy between the balance 
of Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular account in the GL and the amount 



58 
 

reported in the Report on Collections and Deposits (RCDs) and Cash Receipts 

Journal (CRJ) in CO and NCRAB. 

  

2.16 Collection of various fees in CO and NCRAB totaling ₱7,801,194.70, based 
on the RCD, did not tally with the entries made in the CRJ and GL which had 

a balance of ₱7,551,833.97, thus resulting in a discrepancy of ₱249,360.73. 

In preparing the CRJs, the Accounting Staff relied only on the Bank Abstract 

of Daily Collection and Daily Summary of Collection for NLRC submitted 

by the bank due to delayed submission of the RCDs, including the actual OPs 

and supporting documents, by the Cashier. She also added that some deposits 

that were made after the cut-off time were only reported by UCPB on the 

following banking date which might have created minor timing differences. 

 

2.17 The Accounting Staff should not have relied only on the actual deposits made 
to the bank. She could have also verified the collections from the 

corresponding RCDs and OPs in order to determine the correct amount 

deposited. Consequently, the reliability, completeness and accuracy of the 

Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular account is rendered doubtful. 

 

2.18 We recommended that the Management require the Accountant to 
investigate the discrepancy of ₱249,360.73 noted between the RCDs 

prepared by the respective Cashiers and the entries made in the CRJ and 

GL, and prepare the corresponding adjusting entries. 

 

2.19 The Management commented that it is still verifying the cause of the 
discrepancies. Based on the monthly analysis made by the Audit Team, the 

discrepancy consistently showed every month. Possible cause of discrepancy 

is the basis of recording. While the Agency recorded its collection based on 

the Daily Report of Collection submitted by the bank, the Audit Team relied 

on the RCD prepared by the Cashier which may include deposits that are not 

yet reflected in the daily report of the bank. Errors in classification of 

collection both from the Daily Collection Report of the bank and RCD may 

have also contributed to the discrepancy. 

 

a.3 Unrecorded paid PCVs 
 

2.20 Petty operating expenses incurred by CO and NCRAB and RAB I in their 
respective amounts of ₱42,888.80 and ₱3,782.75 were unreplenished as of 

December 31, 2020 but not reported for recording to the appropriate Expense 

accounts and reduction to the Petty Cash account balance to accurately 

present the actual cash on hand as at yearend. Thus, Petty Cash account is 

overstated by ₱46,671.55, which renders the account balance unreliable. 

 

2.21 We recommended that Management require the Petty Cash Fund 
Custodian to report all unreplenished Petty Cash Fund expenses together 

with supporting papers at the end of the year to the Accounting 



59 
 

Division/Unit to recognize the expenses incurred for the period to which 

they relate, in accordance with Section 54, Chapter 19, Volume I of the 

GAM for NGAs. 

 

2.22 The Management of CO and NCRAB, and RAB I agreed with the audit 
observations and committed to comply with the Audit Team’s 

recommendation to recognize expenses charged against the Petty Cash 

account in the period to which they relate, in the succeeding years. 

 

a.4 Non-maintenance of SLs 
 

2.23 Section 114 of PD No. 1445 requires that subsidiary records shall be kept 
where necessary.  The SLs provide the detailed individual balances making 

up the General Ledger (GL) total. They provide substantial audit support for 

the GL and also provide further breakdowns of financial statement totals 

where desired. At the end of the posting period, the balance of the controlling 

account should equal the total of the balances of the accounts in the SLs. 

 

2.24 Except for the interests earned in the LBP account, it has been observed that 
the RAB III’s Cash in Bank-LCCA-UCPB and   Cash in Bank-LCCA-LBP 

amounting to ₱9,305,644.04 and ₱742,273.58, respectively, remained 

dormant/unmoving for years and unaccounted for.  These bank accounts 

comprised of cash bonds, executive fees and attorney’s fees paid by the 

respondents of the cases filed with the NLRC.  The Audit Team noted in the 

previous reports that there were no SLs to provide the breakdown of these 

accounts.  Then incumbent Accountant explained that there are SLs to support 

the accounts, however, the same were not updated.  Consistent to her 

explanation, the Audit Team verified the existence of said SLs that were not 

updated. The last recording was made way back in 2011, whereby the 

balances were not even reconciled with the GL balances. 

 

2.25 The concerned Accountant, in compliance with our recommendation, 
nevertheless, took action and tried to locate the whereabouts of the documents 

pertaining to the amounts deposited in the said accounts for updating, but to 

no avail.  This matter was also coordinated to the CO Accounting Department 

for a possible solution but no appropriate solution has been presented by the 

said office to date.   

 

2.26 The failure of Management to keep and update subsidiary records to support 
the balances in the GL hampers the determination of the actual financial 

condition of the Agency.  The reliability and accuracy of the account balances 

cannot be established, affecting the fair presentation of the FS of the Agency.  

Moreover, the funds deposited with the banks, which remained dormant and 

unused by the Agency, benefit the banks, but deny the government of the 

potential utilization of the said funds.   

 



60 
 

2.27 We reiterated our recommendation that the Executive Labor Arbiter 
direct the personnel concerned to exert more efforts in gathering the 

necessary documents/records to update the SLs pertaining to the Cash in 

Bank-LCCA-UCPB and Cash in Bank-LCCA-LBP, amounting to 

₱9,305,644.04 and ₱742,273.58, respectively, for proper accounting 

thereof and fair presentation of the FSs of the Agency. For the dormant 

account, coordinate with the NLRC-CO Accounting Department for the 

proper management/accounting treatment thereof.   

 

2.28 The Management commented that efforts have already been exerted to locate 
the SLs for the previous years from CYs 2011 to 2016. However, per 

confirmation of the Accounting Personnel who previously handled the 

Agency accounts, the details of the GL balances of the Cash-in Bank-LCCA-

UCPB and Cash-in-Bank-LCCA-LBP account during CYs 2011 to 2016 can 

no longer be retrieved as the data files were either already corrupted or could 

not be recovered. Directives were issued to secure appropriate certification 

from the banks stating this fact as well as official certification of the previous 

responsible officer who claimed that the old files were lost and may no longer 

be physically recovered despite best efforts.  However, from CY 2017 up to 

present, SLs are already in place to monitor the movements of the subject 

accounts. The Management also sought the guidance of the NLRC-CO 

Accounting Department and as per their communication, the latter will 

formulate guidelines on how to manage dormant/non-moving accounts for 

settlement. 

 

2.29 In view of the Management’s comments, the Audit Team further 
recommended to require the personnel responsible to explain and justify the 

loss of records and documents pertinent to the subject bank accounts and 

impose necessary administrative sanctions for any negligence committed. 

 

a.5 Dormant bank account 
 

2.30 Executive Order No. 431 dated May 30, 2005 refers to the directive of the 
President of the Philippines to revert all dormant accounts, unnecessary 

special and trust funds to the General Fund and for other purposes.  It further 

directed that a Permanent Committee composed of the Secretary of Finance 

as Chairman, and the Secretary of Budget and Commission on Audit 

Chairman, as members, shall promulgate the rules and regulations for the 

transfer of such cash balances to the account of the National Treasury. Thus, 

Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012 was issued as its 

Implementing Rules and Regulations. 

 

2.31 Section 3.2 of the same Joint Circular refers to dormant accounts as 
collections authorized by law to be deposited with an AGDB but have 

remained inactive or without any transaction for more than five (5) years since 

its last transaction. 



61 
 

 

2.32 Audit of the Cash in Bank accounts revealed that RAB X maintained a current 
account with the Philippine Veterans Bank (PVB), Cagayan de Oro Branch.  

This account was opened in 1990 as a Trust Fund account for the depository 

of all transactions related to labor cases that need to be resolved by the Agency 

within their area of jurisdiction. Sometime in year 2000, the Agency 

transferred its Trust account to Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), 

leaving the PVB account inactive, without any transactions since then. 

 

2.33 The Agency Accountant averred that she had no idea what happened to this 
bank account considering that she is new to the Agency. The previous 

Accountant who is already promoted to a higher position also has no idea why 

the Trust Fund account was transferred to DBP.  They were not furnished with 

any bank statements, thus to date, no BRS were prepared and submitted to the 

Audit Team. 

 

2.34 As of December 31, 2020, the above account has an outstanding balance of 
₱218,404.29.  Confirmation from the bank received by this Office recently 

showed a bank balance of ₱218,662.93, a minimal difference of ₱258.64.  The 

account was already declared dormant in status by the bank. 

 

2.35 We recommended that the Management of: 
 

a. RAB X determine the composition of the dormant bank account 
balance. Thereafter, coordinate with the NLRC-CO  Accounting 

Department for the proper treatment of the dormant accounts 

pertaining to deposits for Judgment Awards.  

 

b.  NLRC-CO issue guidelines to be followed by all RABs for the 
management/treatment of dormant/non-moving bank account 

deposits that pertain to claims on Judgment Awards and their 

eventual transfer/remittance of the balances to a NLRC Special/Trust 

Account with the National Treasury purposely for the dormant 

unsettled trust liabilities. 

 

2.36 The Management of RAB X replied, through their Accountant, that they are 
currently communicating with the PVB for the transfer of the subject funds to 

the Agency’s Special/Trust Account in the National Treasury.  The bank was 

asking for reasonable time in the processing of the request considering that 

the account was already declared dormant. Records have to be retrieved from 

the vault and have to undergo further review.

b. Deficiencies affecting the reliability of the Receivables account 
balances 

 

2.37 The reliability of the Receivables account with a yearend balance of 
₱44,624,263.79 could not be relied upon due to: (a) unascertained 

collectability of receivables recorded under the Other Receivables account of 

CO and NCRAB; (b) unsubstantiated entry to derecognize receivables under 

the Due from Officers and Employees account of RAB I; and (c) non-

maintenance of SLs of Other Receivables account in CO and NCRAB, 

summarized as follows and discussed in detail in the succeeding paragraphs:

officers (AOs) were dismissed from government service effective September 

10, 2008 and April 17, 2009 because of undocumented/unauthorized 

encashment of checks amounting to ₱28,877,520.45, undeposited collections 

aggregating ₱10,038,015.37 which remained unaccounted in the LBP bank 

accounts, and cash shortage of ₱779,459.59 which was discovered during the 

cash examination by the previous Audit Team and remained unrecovered

Next hearing:  April 19, 2021. 

 

2.41 According to the CO and NCRAB Director for Finance and Administrative 
Service, the recording of the collectibles of ₱39,574,995.41 from the 

aforesaid AOs to the Other Receivables account arose from the 

reclassification to this account from the Cash-Collecting Officers account. 

The amount in question is part and parcel of the Fiduciary Fund which 

includes cash bonds paid by labor case respondents intended for the payment 

of judgment awards. Recorded under the Trust Liabilities account of the 

Agency, the collected cash bonds are required to be deposited in government 

depository banks which are made available when claims for the execution of 

judgment awards occur.  

 

2.42 Considering that these are funds held in trust under the Fiduciary Fund, the 
uncertainty of collection of the subject receivables which has been 

outstanding in the books for approximately 14-16 years adversely affects the 

availability of cash for the payment of the judgment awards to the 

petitioners/respondents of labor cases. Furthermore, payment of judgment 

awards out of the available Fiduciary Fund, even without the recovery of the 

unsettled trust collections from the erring AOs, certainly prejudices the other 

labor cases awaiting resolution. 



65 
 

 

2.43 Other than the filing of criminal charges against the erring NLRC AOs, no 
other information was provided by the Agency on their action undertaken or 

plan on the possible recovery of the trust funds. The AOs were covered by 

Fidelity Bond which the Agency could have accessed to recover the lost 

funds. 

 

2.44 We recommended that the Management of CO and NCRAB: 
 

a. periodically submit to the Audit Team an updated status of the cases 

filed with the courts, together with all the supporting documents; and 

 

b. submit information on any action undertaken or contingency plan of 

the Management on the  possible recovery of the trust fund while 

awaiting the Court’s decision. 

 

2.45 The Management of CO and NCRAB agreed with the audit observations and 
recommendations. The latest case status provided to the Audit Team by the 

NLRC Legal and Enforcement Division was as of February 8, 2021.  

 

b.2 Unsubstantiated entry to derecognize receivables recorded under Due 
from Officers and Employees account 

 

2.46 The amount of ₱11,747.88 recorded under the Due from Officers and Employees 
account of RAB I was derecognized from the books of accounts without supporting 

documents, contrary to Section 111(2) of PD No. 1445 which provides that the 

highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in 

the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading 

information. 

 

2.47 Based on the records and as explained by the Accountant, the whole amount 
of ₱11,747.88 pertains to the overpayment of salary of a dismissed Labor 

Arbiter. An entry to derecognize the said amount from the books was made 

on September 30, 2020. The Accountant claimed that the derecognition was 

made per verbal instruction of NLRC-CO. The entry was not substantiated 

with documents to warrant the derecognition of said receivable, thus 

rendering doubtful the accuracy and validity of the Due from Officers and 

Employees account. 

 

2.48 We recommended that the Management of RAB I ensure compliance 
with Section 111(2) of PD No. 1445 and instruct the Accountant to: 

 

a. revert back the derecognized Due from Officers and Employees in the 

amount of ₱11,747.88 without supporting documents. Henceforth, 

ensure submission of supporting documents to substantiate the 

derecognition from the Agency’s books of accounts; and 

 



66 
 

b. report the amount of receivable due from the dismissed official to the 

NLRC-CO, for possible settlement out of his leave credits or thru 

direct payment.  
 

2.49 The Management of RAB I agreed with the audit observation and committed 
to comply with the audit recommendations. 

  

b.3 Non-maintenance of SLs of Other Receivables account 
 

2.50 The Audit Team in CO and NCRAB observed that the Management does not 
maintain SLs for each identified debtor under the Other Receivables account 

balance of ₱39,632,613.97 to support the transactions recorded in the GL. 

This runs contrary to the requirement in Paragraph 2, Section 114 of PD No. 

1445. The maintenance of subsidiary records is a mitigating control necessary 

in monitoring transactions posted in the books of accounts enabling the 

Management to easily ascertain the age and amount of each debtors’ 

responsibilities to the Agency, among others. 

 

2.51 We recommended that the Management direct the Accounting Unit to 
maintain SLs for Other Receivables account, in compliance with the 

requirement of Paragraph 2, Section 114 of PD No. 1445. 

 

2.52 The Management of CO and NCRAB commented that it will provide the 
Audit Team with the SL and Status of Other Receivables, Disallowances and 

Other Charges which contains the details needed by the Audit Team. 

 

c. Deficiencies affecting the reliability of Inventories account balances

2.54 Volume III of the GAM for NGAs provides the definition of the following 
accounts:

Account Title Account Description 

Medical, Dental and Laboratory

This account is used to recognize the cost of 

medical, dental and laboratory supplies 

purchased/received for government operations.

This account is used to recognize the cost of

This account is used to recognize other 

operating expenses not falling under any of the 

specific maintenance and other operating 

expense accounts. This account shall be closed 

to the Revenue and Expense Summary Account. 

 

2.55 Purchased inventories with a total cost of ₱112,826.50 in RABs VIII, XI and 
XIII were recognized as outright expense instead of recording the same in 

their appropriate Inventories accounts. Details are as follows:

2.56 The Bookkeeper in RAB XI explained that she is dependent only upon the 
account obligated per Obligation Request and Status (ORS). Moreover, the 

Agency had not experienced procurement of medical supplies in the past, thus 

they are unfamiliar as to how it should be treated in their books of accounts.  

 

2.57 The foregoing erroneous recording of inventories as outright expense 
rendered the affected Inventories and Expense accounts unreliable. 

 



68 
 

2.58 We recommended that Management of RABs VIII, XI and XIII direct 
their Accounting Units to initially record purchased inventories under 

the appropriate Inventories account provided in the Revised Chart of 

Accounts in Volume III of the GAM for NGAs unless, said inventories 

have been issued immediately to end-users. 

 

2.59 The Management commented that: 
 

RAB Management Comment 

VIII The Management committed to refer to the Revised Chart of Accounts as 

its guide in recording and classifying of transactions to appropriate 

accounts. 

XI The Management commented that the purchase of supplies related to 

COVID-19 was lodged with Other Maintenance and Operating Expense 

account since various transactions were unprogrammed expenditures and 

not included in the 2020 Annual Procurement Plan (APP). It also 

informed the Audit Team that the proposed adjusting entries were already 

made. 

XIII The Management commented that it directed the Accountant to comply 

with the recommendations. 

 

c.2 SCs and SLCs were not regularly updated 
 

2.60 Verification of records in RAB CAR revealed that the RSMI was not 
submitted by the Property Unit on time which resulted in delayed or non-

recording of issued supplies in the SCs and SLCs by the Property and 

Accounting Unit, respectively. Consequently, the SCs and SLCs were not 

regularly updated, making it difficult to countercheck and track the movement 

of supplies and compromising the reliability of the Office Supplies Inventory 

account amounting to ₱48,497.81. 

 

2.61 We recommended that the Management of RAB CAR direct the 
personnel in the Supply and Accounting Units to update regularly the 

SCs and SLCs, respectively.  

 

2.62 The Management of RAB CAR commented that it will instruct the Inventory 
Committee to conduct a thorough physical count and enjoin the Supply Unit 

to accomplish the RSMI which will be monitored monthly by the ELA 

himself. 

 

c.3 Non-preparation of RSMI and RIS forms 
 

2.63 It was observed that RAB XI no longer use RSMI and RIS forms for its 
Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Inventory. This is because the 

medical supplies purchased by the Agency were directly expensed. It 

contravened the standard government practice of using asset method in 

recording assets in the books of accounts. It defeated the purpose of said forms 

where the RSMI summarizes all the RISs issued to end-users, with the latter 



69 
 

serving as proof that the medical items expensed were actually received by 

the requesting units. The RSMI should have also served as the basis of the 

Bookkeeper in preparing the JEV to record the medical supplies issued in 

order to reflect the accurate balance of the Agency’s Inventory accounts.  

 

2.64 We recommended that the Management of RAB XI require the Supply 
Officer and Bookkeeper to use RISs and RSMIs as among those reports 

required in the proper recording of issuance of inventories, as prescribed 

in the GAM for NGAs. 
 

2.65 The Management of RAB XI agreed with the audit observation and 
committed to comply with the audit recommendations. 

 

c.4 Misclassified Inventories 
 

2.66 In RAB VIII, procured semi-expendable ICT equipment; medical, dental and 
laboratory supplies; and other supplies and materials worth ₱1,656.25, 

₱7,058.84 and ₱6,584.89, respectively, were erroneously classified and 

recorded under Office Supplies Inventory account instead of their appropriate 

Inventory accounts such as Semi-Expendable ICT, Medical, Dental and 

Laboratory Supplies Inventory, and Other Supplies and Materials Inventory.

2.67 The erroneous recording of transactions resulted in unreliable balances of the 
said Inventories sub-accounts. 

 

2.68 We recommended that the Management of RAB VIII direct the 
Accountant to make adjustments in the books for the misclassified 

Inventories accounts and to refer to the Revised Chart of Accounts under 

Volume III of the GAM for NGAs to properly classify transactions.   

  

2.69 The Management of RAB VIII agreed with the audit observation and 
committed to comply with the recommendation accordingly. 

 

d. Deficiencies affecting the reliability of Other Current Assets account 
balances 

 

2.70 For purposes of reconciling and cleaning the government books of accounts, 
COA issued COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, 

regarding Guidelines and Procedures on the Write-off of Dormant Accounts, 

which Section 5.5 thereof, defines “Dormant Unliquidated Cash Advances” 

as those granted to disbursing officers, agency officers and employees which 

remained non-moving for 10 years or more and where 

settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained. The Circular 

provides, among others, the specific guidelines and procedures in the write-

off of dormant accounts: 

 

 The Accountant shall prepare aging of dormant receivables, unliquidated 
cash advances, and fund transfers on a quarterly basis to support the 

request for write-off, and indicate the existence of the applicable 

conditions, as follows: 

 

a. Absence of records or documents to validate/support the claim and/or 
unreconciled reciprocal accounts 

b. Death of the accountable officer/employee/debtor 
c. Unknown whereabouts of the accountable officer/employee/debtor, 

and that he/she could not be located despite diligent efforts to find 

him/her 

d. Incapacity to pay or insolvency 
e. Exhaustion of all possible remedies by the Management to collect the 

receivables and to demand liquidation of cash advances and fund 

transfers 

f. No pending case in court involving the subject dormant accounts. 
 

 The Head of the government entity shall file the request for authority to 
write-off dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and 

fund transfers to the COA Audit Team Leader (ATL) and/or Supervising 

Auditor (SA).  No filing fee is required. 

 



71 
 

 The request shall be supported by the following documents: 
 

a.  Schedule of dormant accounts by accountable 
officer/debtor/government entity and by account, certified by the 

Accountant and approved by the Head of the government entity; 

b. Certified relevant documents validating the existence of the 
conditions, as applicable, such as: 

 

1.  Death Certificate issued by Philippine Statistics Authority 
(formerly National Statistics Office) 

2. Proof of Insolvency 
3. Certificate from the Dept. of Trade and Industry that the debtor 

has no registered business 

4. Certification from the Securities and Exchange Commission that 
the Corporation is no longer active 

5. Certificate of no residence in the barangay of the municipality/city 
of last known address 

6. Proof exhaustion of all remedies to collect the receivables and 
demand to liquidate the cash advances and fund transfers, such as 

but not limited to copies of served or returned demand letters 

7. Certification by Legal Officer of the entity of no pending case 
relative to the account 

8. Certification by the responsible officials of the entity to the effect 
that there are no records/documents available to validate claim 

9. Other justifications, like in the case of request for write-off due to 
loss of documents, the circumstances of the loss should be stated 

in the letter-request 

10. In case of fund transfer, the unliquidated amount after 
reconciliation shall be supported by certification by the Chief 

Accountants and approved by the Heads of the source and 

implementing entities that the fund was utilized for the purpose, 

and certification from the recipient that the project was partially 

or fully implemented, supported by pictures of the implemented 

projects 

 

2.71 The NLRC-CO and NCRAB books show the Advances account had a total 
balance of ₱464,599.43 as of December 31, 2020,  consisting  of the following 

sub-accounts:

72 
 

2.72 Out of the total cash advances of ₱464,599.43, the amount of ₱138,619.43 
aged 10 years and more remained unliquidated as at yearend, which had been 

observed and reported in the previous years’ audit reports. Details of the 

dormant advances are as follows:

Total 138,619.43    

 

2.73 The Management updated the Audit Team with the following explanations: 
 

a. The cash advance amounting to ₱109,239.18 represents reconciling items 
between the General Ledger and Subsidiary Ledger, verification of which 

to determine the accountable officers or employees yielded negative 

results; 

 

b. The unliquidated cash advance of ₱17,000.25 aged 18 years pertains to 
the Petty Cash Fund of former Cashier, Ms. Rosemarilou D. Gertes. It 

could no longer be accounted for and liquidated due to her reassignment 

to another office in CY 2006 and subsequent dismissal from the service 

on April 17, 2009. Criminal charges were filed against her for alleged 

malversation of public funds for other cash transactions, in violation of 

Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code, which are still pending and 

unresolved in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City; 

 

c. The cash advance granted to Mr. Jerson Sanota for his travel to Palawan 
amounting to ₱12,380.00 was not liquidated since he already 

resigned/separated from the service since CY 2006. Demand letters were 

sent to him on his last known address. However, the Management had 

neither received any reply from him nor any settlement of the 

unliquidated cash advance;  

 

d. Management had undertaken follow-ups for the settlement of cash 
advances granted to Ms. Gertes and Mr. Sanota but to no avail. 

 



73 
 

2.74 The aforementioned unliquidated cash advances are already considered 
dormant, as contemplated in its definition in COA Circular No. 2016-005 

dated December 19, 2016. In the previous year, the Management had 

manifested the nil possibility of collection of the subject dormant unliquidated 

cash advances which urged the Audit Team to recommend to consider 

requesting its write-off, except for the unliquidated cash advance of Ms. 

Gertes, whose accountabilities are subject to criminal charges still pending in 

the RTC of Quezon City, following the requirements prescribed under COA 

Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. The Management 

concurred with the said recommendation; however, no such request has been 

submitted to the Audit Team as of this writing. 

 

2.75 The non-liquidation/settlement of the dormant unliquidated cash advances, 
which settlement/collectability remains uncertain, casts doubts on their 

reliability and presentation as Other Current Assets.  

 

2.76 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. exert more efforts to demand from the dismissed Accountable 
Officers the immediate settlement of their accountabilities, including 

the filing of claims against their fidelity bond, if any; and 

 

b. in case all remedies have already been exhausted, assess the eligibility 
of the dormant unliquidated  unsupported recorded cash advances 

and that of Mr. Sanota for possible write-off, in accordance with the 

procedures prescribed in COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated 

December 19, 2016. Prepare all the necessary working 

papers/documentation in support of the results of verification and 

analysis of the unliquidated undetermined cash advance amounting 

to ₱109,239.18 to establish the validity thereof. In the event that 

further verification and analysis constantly yield negative results, 

consider requesting for write-off. 

 

2.77 The Management agreed with the audit observation. It has already exerted 
effort to collect the cash accountability of Mr. Sanota but to no avail. In the 

case of Ms. Gertes, she was barred from entering her office from the date of 

discovery of the irregularities she committed up until her dismissal from the 

service. Because of this, she was not able to retrieve and liquidate her cash 

advance. It believe that their cash advances are eligible for write-off since 

these involve cash advances which have been outstanding and unliquidated 

for more than ten years and the possibility of recovery is very remote. It will 

submit a request for write-off to the Audit Team. 

 

2.78 On the unreconciled amount of ₱109,239.18, the Management will likewise 
request for the write-off of the amount due to the absence of record or 



74 
 

documents to validate/support the continued recognition of this unreconciled 

amount. 

 

e. Deficiencies affecting the reliability of PPE accounts 
 

2.79 The PPE account balances are likewise unreliable due to the following 
observations:

2.80 A comparison between the Accounting Unit records and Report on the 
Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) revealed discrepancies approximately 

amounting to ₱312,145.45, thereby casting doubts on the reliability of the 

PPE accounts in RABs VII and XI. The discrepancies noted are summarized 

as follows:

Total 2,984,185.76 2,672,040.31 312,145.45 

 

2.81 The Audit Team of RAB VII observed from its verification of the RPCPPE 
and PPELC as of December 31, 2020 that various PPEs totalling ₱204,831.96 

were not recorded in the property records/reports. Interview with the 

Accountant revealed that the unrecorded PPEs were property transfers from 

NLRC-CO. 

 

2.82 Moreover, non-existent PPEs totaling ₱84,037.36 are still recorded in the 
property records/reports of RAB VII. The Accountant disclosed that these 

non-existent PPEs might pertain to the property transfers to a local 

government unit (LGU) during CY 2018. A copy of the Property Transfer 



75 
 

Report (PTR) was given by the Property Custodian to the Accountant, but the 

latter has yet to verify the same to ascertain whether the noted difference in 

RPCPPE and PPELC relative thereof is indeed the property transfers made to 

the LGU. 

 

2.83 In RAB VIII, the Accounting and Property Unit’s records are not reconciled 
due to non-preparation/maintenance of PPELC by the Accounting Unit and  

failure to conduct complete physical count of PPE by the Inventory 

Committee, contrary to Section 42 items (e) and (g) of Chapter 10, Volume I, 

GAM for NGAs. Hence, the reported PPE balance of ₱942,575.76  as of 

December 31, 2020 cannot be relied upon. 

 

2.84 Meanwhile, the RPCPPE and Trial Balance figures submitted by the 
Management of RAB XI showed discrepancies between the two reports, viz:

2.85 The ₱193,500.60 variance in the Information and Communication 
Technology Equipment was caused by the following:

2.86 A computer unit worth ₱51,000.00 was reported in the RPCPPE but not 
recorded in the SL. The Bookkeeper disclosed that said computer was 

transferred by NLRC-CO to RAB XI but not supported with JEV. 

Consequently, the Accounting Unit could not record the transferred property 

in its books of accounts sans determination of its carrying value which could 

be found in the JEV. This matter has yet to be communicated by the 

Accountant to the NLRC-CO for proper disposition. 

 

2.87 Further, the Motor Vehicles presented in the FS differ in amount reported in 
the RPCPPE by ₱2,149.75. The Bookkeeper remarked that this amount 

pertains to costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the service vehicle.

2.88 In addition, the “Balance per Card”, “Balance on Hand per Count”, and 
“Shortage/Overage” columns of the RPCPPE were not properly 

accomplished. The accomplishment of these columns would show the users 

of financial information the results of their RPCPPE. Moreover, the Supply 

Officer certified to the correctness of the Report on the Physical Count of her 

accountabilities, contrary to the requirements of Annex 73(c), Volume II of 

the GAM for NGAs where the Inventory Committee Chair and all the 

members of the committee, with the Supply Officer and the Bookkeeper as 

members thereof, are to sign the report certifying its correctness.  

  

2.89 This oversight consequently contributed to the non-detection and non-
correction of errors and discrepancies in the RPCPPE, since absence of the 

signature of other members of the Inventory Committee would imply that the 

report did not undergo review and scrutiny, before the approval thereof by the 

Head of the Agency.  

 

2.90 We recommended that the Management of: 
 

a. RAB VII to: 
  

i. direct the Accountant to record the transferred PPE to LGU.   In 
the absence of documents, direct the Property Officer to exert 

extra effort to trace/locate the documents on the transfer of PPE 

to LGU during CY 2018; 

 

ii. direct the Accountant and Property Custodian to regularly 
reconcile their records (every quarter), to avoid discrepancies; 

 

b. RAB VII and XI request from the NLRC-CO a copy of its JEV 
relative to the property transfers to the RABs, copy furnish the Audit 

Team. Thereafter, prepare a JEV to record the receipt of the 

transferred property; 

  

c. RAB VIII to: 
 

i. direct the Accounting Unit to prepare and maintain PPELCs for 
each item of the Agency’s PPE; 

 

ii. prepare and submit the RPCPPE as of December 31, 2020 to 
determine the physical existence of the PPE which would 

corroborate the reliability of PPE account balance as per   

Accounting records; 

 

d. RAB XI to:  
 



77 
 

i. issue a memorandum to the Bookkeeper and Supply Officer, 
instructing them to ensure that the RPCPPE is reconciled with the 

financial statements and the Agency’s books of accounts before 

submitting them for approval of the Inventory Committee and the 

Head of the Agency; and 

  

ii. issue a memorandum to all members of the Inventory Committee, 
instructing therein to review and ensure the correctness, 

completeness and accuracy of the RPCPPE and to affix their 

signatures therein. 

 

2.91 The Management comments are as follows: 
 

Office/RAB Management Comments 

VII The Management commented that they will complete the reconciliation 

on or before March 31, 2021.  

VIII The Management agreed with the audit observations and 

recommendations and commented that PCs for all PPEs and PPELCs 

are already maintained by the Supply Officer-Designate and Accounting 

Unit, respectively. 

XI The Management commented that Memorandum No. 21-02-001 dated 

February 4, 2021 was issued to the Bookkeeper and the Supply Officer 

for the reconciliation of the RPCPPE and books of accounts. Likewise, 

the ELA has also issued Memorandum No. 21-02-002 dated February 4, 

2021 to the members of the Inventory Committee to review and ensure 

the correctness, completeness and accuracy of the RPCPPE, and to affix 

their signatures therein.  

  

The Management has also formally communicated with the Chief 

Accountant of the NLRC-CO/NCRAB to request for the JEV made by 

the latter to derecognize the PPE item in their books which shall be used 

as supporting document to recognize the computer in the RAB XI’s 

books.  

 

e.2  Failure to conduct inventory of PPE and non-preparation of RPCPPE 

 

2.92 Section 38, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM states that the entity shall have 
a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented 

in the RPCPPE (Appendix 17) as of December 31 of each year.  This shall be 

submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following 

year.  Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical 

count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper 

accounting/recording. 

 

2.93 The Management of RAB VI was not able conduct physical count of their 
PPE for two consecutive years thus, the existence and completeness of the 

PPE account reported in the yearend FS amounting to ₱3,973,621.01 cannot 

be relied upon. Consequently, the RPCPPE was not prepared, contrary to 

Chapter 10, Section 38, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. The Management 



78 
 

explained that the incumbent Supply Officer is on sick leave since October 

16, 2020 and as a mitigating control, two personnel are now assigned to 

perform all the work related to the Supply Officer’s responsibilities. 

 

2.94 We recommended that the Management of RAB VI: 
 

a. conduct a complete physical count of PPE annually; 
  

b. prepare RPCPPE as at December 31 of each year using the prescribed 
form which shall be certified correct by the Inventory Committee 

Chair and Members, approved by the Head of Agency, and verified 

by the COA Representative; and  

 

c.    furnish the Audit Team a copy of the RPCPPE not later than January 
31 of the following year, in accordance with Section 38, Chapter 10, 

Volume I of the GAM for NGAs.  

 

2.95 The Management of RAB VI explained that the Property and Supply Officer 
is on sick leave since October 16, 2020. Nevertheless, it is now in the process 

of reconciling the Property and Supply Officer’s files and data for his 

inventory report on PPE. 

 

e.3 Non-inclusion of Office Equipment and ICT Equipment in RPCPPE and 
PARs 

 

2.96 The Audit Team of CAR conducted a random physical count of the PPE and 
found out that there were equipment that were not included in the RPCPPE 

as of June 30, 2020. The identified PPE items are as follows: 

 
Table 21: PPE Not Included in the RPCPPE and Not Supported with PAR 

Particulars

Power Generator Set 11/27/2017 1 28,080.00  Storage area 

Desktop Computer  09/07/2018 2 62,192.00       Issued to personnel 

Total 90,272.00  

 

2.97 Further verification of the documents showed that the said PPE items were 
not supported with PARs which determine the person accountable for these 

properties.  With the absence of the PAR, accountability over the PPE item 

was not established and who should be accountable for items that might be 

lost/damaged. 

 

2.98 We recommended that the Management of RAB CAR direct the 
Property Officer to include all PPE items in the RPCPPE and submit to 

the Audit Team an updated RPCPPE every January 31 of each year; and 

issue the corresponding PAR to end-users.  

 



79 
 

e.4 Unserviceable properties dropped from the books of accounts but not 
yet disposed 

 

2.99 Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides that: 
 

When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, 

or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer 

accountable therefor, be inspected by the head of the agency or his 

duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor 

concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be 

destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at 

public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper 

committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor 

concerned or other duly authorized representative of the Commission, 

after advertising by printed notice in the Official Gazette, or for not 

less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of general 

circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the 

expense of publication, by notices posted for a like period in at least 

three public places in the locality where the property is to be sold. In 

the event that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a 

private sale at such price as may be fixed by the same committee or 

body concerned and approved by the Commission. 

 

2.100 Moreover, paragraphs (d) and (e) of Section 39, Chapter 10, Volume I of 
GAM for NGAs provides that: 

 

(d) A JEV shall be prepared by the Accounting Division/Unit to 

derecognize the asset from the books of accounts only after its 

disposal. 
 

(e) Disposal procedures of unserviceable property shall be in 

accordance with applicable rules and regulations on Supply and 

Property Management Manual, and Section 79 of PD No. 1445. 

 

2.101 Section 40(d) also states that all unserviceable property shall be reported in 
the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) 

(Appendix 74). 

 

2.102 Based on the IIRUP submitted by RAB I and Seventh Division, the Audit 
Teams noted that unserviceable properties with a total cost of ₱1,473,697.52 

were not yet disposed, contrary to the requirement of Section 79 of PD No. 

1445. The unserviceable properties in the said Offices are broken down as 

follows:

80 
 

Office/RAB Total Cost 

7th Division 243,460.00 

Total 1,473,697.52 

 

2.103 The above unserviceable properties were already dropped from the books of 
accounts but not yet disposed. Although unserviceable properties no longer 

provide service potential and future benefits which are expected to flow to the 

entity, the same no longer qualify as assets. However, they should remain 

recorded in the PPE account until such time that disposal thereof has been 

made. It is only then that unserviceable properties are derecognized from the 

books of accounts. 
 

2.104 We recommended that the Management of: 
 

a. RAB I ensure compliance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445 on the 
disposal of the unserviceable properties, by instructing the Property 

Officer and the Accountant to: conduct complete inventory-taking 

for the one-time cleansing of the PPE accounts of the Agency, in 

accordance with COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020; 

and prepare the necessary documents for the disposal; and dispose of 

the unserviceable properties in accordance with the guidelines under 

COA Circular No. 89-296 and NBC Circular No. 425 (Manual on 

Disposal of Government Property); 

 

b. Seventh Division: 
 

i. constitute a Disposal Committee to decide on the proper mode of 
disposal of the unserviceable properties reported in the IIRUP; 

and 
 

ii. direct the Property Officer to immediately dispose the 
unserviceable properties, to prevent their further deterioration, 

once the Disposal Committee has decided on the mode of disposal. 

 

2.105 The Management comments are as follows: 
 

Office/RAB Management Comments 

I The Management committed to comply with the audit 

recommendations. 

7th Division The Management commented that Disposal Committee is now instituted 

for the eventual disposal of unserviceable properties and reversion will 

be made pending the disposal thereof. 

 

e.5 Misclassified PPE 
 

2.106 Section 4, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that: 
 



81 
 

The capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 represents the minimum 

cost of an individual asset recognized as a PPE on the Statement of 

Financial Position.  

 

This threshold shall be applied on an individual asset or per item basis. 

Each item within the bulk acquisition with aggregate or total value of 

PPE, such as library books, computer peripherals and small items of 

equipment, will need to meet the capitalization threshold to be 

recognized as PPE. 

 

2.107 Verification of the PPE account balance in RABs I and II disclosed several 
items that fall below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 as recognition 

criteria for PPE. In RAB I, 592 books with total cost of ₱313,415.70 and 

individual costs ranging from ₱105.00 to ₱1,796.00 were still recorded under 

the Furniture, Fixtures and Books account, a sub-account of PPE.  

 

2.108 In RAB II, 14 semi-expendable ICT equipment worth ₱39,119.00 were 
included in the RAB’s Information and Communication Technology 

Equipment account, also a sub-account of PPE. According to the 

Management of RAB II, the said items were replacements to computer 

accessories which were already not functioning.  Considering that each 

computer set with accessories was recorded at lump-sum, the Management 

was not aware of the proper accounting treatment of replaced parts and 

accessories, hence capitalizing it as part of Information and Communication 

Technology Equipment account. 

 

2.109 Since the unit cost of the aforementioned items fall below the capitalization 
threshold of ₱15,000.00 to be qualified as PPE, these items should be 

reclassified either to its appropriate Inventory or Expense account if issued 

during the year. Otherwise, these should be debited under the Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) account if already issued to end-users in the prior years. 

 

2.110 The non-reclassification of various semi-expendable items of RABs I and II 
affected the fair presentation of the PPE and related Expense/Accumulated 

Surplus accounts in the FS resulting in the overstatement of Various PPE 

accounts and understatement of various Expense/Accumulated Surplus 

accounts by ₱352,534.70.  

 

2.111 We recommended that the Management of RABs I and II recognize the 
correction/adjustment in the books to reflect the correct balance of the 

PPE and other affected accounts. 
 

2.112 The Management of RABs I and II agreed with the audit observations and 
committed to comply with the recommendations.

f. Deficiencies affecting the reliability of the Liabilities account balances 
 

2.113 The Liabilities account balance of ₱3,203,904,611.52 in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position of NLRC as of December 31, 2020 is 

unreliable due to the following deficiencies:

2.114 Among the books of accounts that are required to be maintained by NGAs, as 
prescribed in Section 12, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, is the SL. It is 

required to be maintained for each of the control account in the GL. 

 

2.115 The SL as shown in Appendix 6 of the Volume II, of the GAM for NGAs 
provides the detail for each control account in the GL which is maintained per 

account and fund cluster by the Accounting Division/Unit. 

 

2.116 Section 20, Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs states that:  
 

Each material class of similar items shall be presented separately in 

the financial statements. Items of a dissimilar nature or function shall 

be presented separately unless they are immaterial. If a line item is not 

material, it is aggregated with other items either on the face of FSs or 

                                                 
3 The unreconciled balance between the Trust Liabilities and the total Cash in Bank accounts amounting to 

₱18,756,605.69 in CO and NCRAB also has no Schedules and disclosures in the Notes to FS showing its  

composition, aging and details  of  the trust liability for each case based on subsidiary records 



83 
 

in the Notes to the FSs. A specific disclosure requirement in a PPSAS4 

need not be satisfied if the information is not material. 

 

2.117 The NLRC Trust Liabilities account consists of Fiduciary Fund and 
Execution Fees: 

 
Fund Nature Purposes 

Fiduciary Fund Cash bonds posted by the 

respondents and garnishments

2.118 The GL balance of the Trust Liabilities account of RAB I amounting to 
₱86,728,967.91 differs with the total balance of the SL balance of 

₱86,921,742.15 maintained for the Trust Fund and Execution fund by 

₱252,774.24. The difference was due to the non-maintenance in previous 

years of SLs for each labor case and non-reconciliation of the Trust Fund 

record with the GL balance, contrary to the requirements under Appendix 6, 

Volume II of the GAM for NGAs. For CY 2020, the Agency had already 

started the preparation of SLs for each labor case. However, the reconciliation 

of the Trust Fund record/SLs with the GL balance of Trust Liabilities was not 

yet completely done, resulting in unaccounted difference of ₱252,774.24. 

 

2.119 On the other hand, the SL of the Trust Fund as of December 31, 2020 includes 
unremitted amount of execution fees/deposit fees/interest income to NLRC-

CO/BTr/BIR and other adjustments, long outstanding and/or immaterial 

amounts of unwithdrawn balances on decided cases, and outstanding balances 

of Trust Liabilities amounting to ₱4,679.58, ₱33,331.68 and ₱86,891,000.24, 

respectively. The unremitted execution/deposit fees/interest income, and 

outstanding balances of Trust Liabilities should be verified against the 

financial records/reports to ensure that these represent unremitted amounts 

and outstanding liabilities under the labor case.

84 
 

2.120 Meanwhile, review of the SLs and GL balances for the Trust Liabilities-
Execution Fund and Trust Liabilities-Awards accounts of RAB V as of 

December 31, 2020 showed the following:

2.121 As can be noted in the above table, the balance of the Trust Liabilities-
Execution Fund SLs reconciled with the balance per GL for said account, 

while those of the Trust Liabilities-Awards showed a difference of 

₱2,446,601.61. The same observation was also noted in the previous year. 

During the year, the Acting Accountant was able to provide the Audit Team 

with SLs for the subject accounts. However, SL balances were not reconciled 

with the GL as of December 31, 2020.  

 

2.122 We recommended that the Management of: 
 

a. RAB I: 
 

i. update the SLs to include the identified reconciling items which 
will minimize/eliminate the discrepancies noted and reflect the 

correct balance supporting the GL of the Trust Liabilities 

account; 

 

ii. require the Accountant to analyze the composition of the Trust 
Fund and deposit any unremitted execution fees/deposit 

fees/interest income to the NLRC-CO/BTr/BIR; cause the 

payment/remittance to the proper parties; and coordinate with 

the NLRC-CO for the proper management/treatment of the long 

outstanding excess cash balances; and 

 

b. RAB V require the Acting Accountant to reconcile the balance of the 
SLs and GL for the Trust Liabilities account, pursuant to Section 

6(e), Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. 

 

2.123 The Management commented that: 
 

Office/RAB Management Comment 

I The Management committed to comply with the audit recommendations. 

They will conduct reconciliation of the subsidiary records with the Trust 

Liabilities and Cash in Bank-LCCA-DBP accounts; and will review the 

records for preparation of the order for release of the excess cash 

balances, if warranted. 



85 
 

Office/RAB Management Comment 

V The former Acting Accountant explained that they have tried to reconcile 

the SLs balances with the GL totals for the Trust Liabilities accounts, but 

was unable to finish the reconciliation due to time constraint.  Likewise, 

the difference of ₱2,446,601.61 pertains to prior years, hence they have 

not completed the reconciliation as of yearend. 

 

2.124 The Audit Team of RAB V sustained its recommendation. The Acting 
Accountant should continue working back to prior years’ transactions of the 

account in order to fully reconcile the SL and GL balances. 

 

f.2 Difference between the unreconciled Trust Liabilities account balance 
and the total Cash in Bank balances, which represent the available cash 

for the Fiduciary and Execution Fund 

 

2.125 Comparison between the account balances of the reciprocal accounts Trust 
Liabilities and Cash in Bank in CO and NCRAB, and RAB I showed a total 

difference of ₱18,776,337.69. Details are as follows: 

                 
Table 25: Difference Between the Trust Liabilities and Cash in Bank Accounts

RAB I 86,709,235.91 86,728,967.91 19,732.00 

Total 1,959,965,750.97 1,978,742,088.66 18,776,337.69 

 

2.126 The same difference was reported in the previous year’s audit in RAB I, 
depicting non-reconciliation thereof by the Agency as of audit date. 

Verification disclosed that recording of transactions under the accounts from 

CYs 2018 to 2020 was in order. The lack of accounting records for CY 2017 

and earlier years did not facilitate the tracing of the discrepancies by the Audit 

Team.  

 

2.127 Matching of posted trust liability for each case and the deposited cash is 
crucial since this shows the limit and availability of cash for disbursement to 

execute the Judgment Awards. The non-reconciliation of the Trust Liabilities 

with the Cash in Bank accounts casts doubt on the accuracy of the balance of 

the reciprocal accounts in the FS. 

 

2.128 We recommended that the Management of CO and NCRAB, and RAB I 
reconcile the balances of the Trust Liabilities account with the reciprocal 

Cash in Bank accounts to establish the correct balance of trust liabilities 

and the available cash for disbursement to execute the Judgment 

Awards. 

 

2.129 The Management commented that: 
 



86 
 

Office/RAB Management Comment 

CO and NCR The Management agreed with the audit observation. However, it pointed 

out the following: 

 

a. The noted discrepancy between accounts pertains to prior years’ 
(mostly 2006 and older). The Management is continuously reviewing 

our prior years’ records and reports to determine the cause of the 

unreconciled balances and to adjust the affected accounts. However, 

due to lack or incomplete documentation in prior years, it is 

experiencing delays in the reconciliation. As to recent years’ 

transactions, these are properly recorded and reported to the Audit 

Team. It emphasizes that the Agency did not receive any significant 

audit findings or errors traceable to recent years’ transactions which 

affected the reliability of the Trust Liabilities and Cash accounts.  

 

b. On the result of analysis between Cash and Trust Liabilities account 
balances, the Management agrees that the reported Trust Liabilities 

balance is higher than the Cash in Bank balance by ₱18,756,605.69. 

However, this figure should not be the sole basis in determining the 

reliability of an account balance. This discrepancy should be further 

analyzed and should also consider those undeposited collections and 

embezzled amounts recorded under Other Receivables account 

amounting to ₱39,574,995.41 (Note 5.3 of NLRC Central Office and 

NCR Notes to FS). Other items which should also be considered are 

the following: 

 

1. Effect of book and bank reconciliation items reported in our BRS 
when these are finally verified and reconciled. 

2. Unremitted interest income of the Agency’s dollar account. 
3. Recognition of foreign exchange gains or loss at yearend which 

may increase or reduce cash but will not affect the Trust 

Liabilities account. 

4. Deposit fees deducted from judgment awards but not yet 
remitted as of yearend; and 

5. Proceeds from sale of bidding documents, and deposit to trust 
fund account as payment for COA disallowances. 

 

Consideration of the above may meaningfully explain the noted 

discrepancy between the Cash and Trust Liabilities accounts. 

 

c. Current and recent years’ transactions are properly recorded in the 
individual SLs of each case. There was no AOM in the current or 

recent years regarding any deficiency in recording current and recent 

years’ transaction in the SLs. The cause of discrepancy is the 

incomplete SLs of prior years (mostly 2006 and older). 

 

Nevertheless, the Management committed to comply with the audit 

recommendations. 

I The Management committed to comply with the audit recommendations. 

They will conduct reconciliation of the subsidiary records with the Trust 

Liabilities and Cash in Bank-LCCA-DBP accounts; and will review the 

records for preparation of the order for release of the excess cash 

balances, if warranted. 

 



87 
 

2.130 The Audit Team in CO and NCRAB suggests that the Accounting Unit 
investigate further the Cash in Bank and Trust Liabilities accounts by looking 

upon their list of suggested reports/transactions that may have affected the 

unreconciled balances. It should also consider tracing back ledger postings or 

footings. Nevertheless, it must exert more efforts to reconcile the said 

balances to establish the fair presentation of the affected accounts in the FSs. 

 

f.3 Absence of  Schedules of Trust Liabilities and disclosures in the Notes 
to FS showing the  composition, aging and details of  the trust liability 

for each case based on SLs 

 

2.131 The GL Trust Liabilities account balance of NLRC-CO and NCRAB of 
₱1,892,013,120.75 was not fully supported with Schedules of Trust Liabilities 

due to particular individual case/trustor and the aging and details thereof 

based on subsidiary records.  SLs for the Fiduciary Fund presented for audit 

were incomplete for tracing the transactions for each case. 

 

2.132 Moreover, necessary disclosures such as, but not limited to, age of Trust 
Liabilities and composition and balances of the Trust Liabilities, as 

represented by the Cash Bonds and Fiduciary Awards, were not presented in 

the Notes to FS.  

 

2.133 We recommended that the Management of CO and NCRAB:  
 

a. maintain and update Schedules of Trust Liabilities complete with 
aging and details for each case based on subsidiary records, and  

 

b. include in the Notes to FS the necessary disclosures such as, but not 
limited to composition, aging and balances of the Trust Liabilities, as 

represented by the Cash Bonds and Fiduciary Awards and Execution 

Fees. 

 

f.4 Non-preparation and maintenance of complete SLs 
 

2.134 Trust Liabilities account as of December 31, 2020 of RAB VI amounting to 
₱70,479,894.63 was not supported with schedules of subsidiary balances, 

contrary to sound accounting practices provided under Section 12, Volume I 

of the GAM for NGAs, thus the validity of said account  could not be 

ascertained. Similar observation was brought to the attention of Management 

in CY 2016 to 2019 audit reports. The Accountant failed to submit schedule 

of Trust Liabilities account (SL balances) to support the correctness of the 

amount presented in the GL and Trial Balance. 

 

2.135 The Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation (AAPSI) as of 
December 31, 2020 submitted by the Management explained that Bacolod has 

already provided an inventory of cases as of December 31, 2019. However, 

as for Iloilo, the former Accountant has still not turned over her records to the 



88 
 

current Accountant for the reconciliation and proper identification of SRAB 

VI Trust Liabilities. 

 

2.136 Likewise, verification of the Trust Liabilities account of RAB IX revealed a 
balance of ₱13.198 million as of December 31, 2020. However, the amount 

cannot be completely relied upon because the SL submitted contained 

information which only pertains to CY 2020 transactions despite having 

schedules for the collections and payment of awards dating back to 1991. 

Similar observations were already made in CYs 2018 and 2019 audits, 

however, the Management has yet to fully comply with the recommendation 

and only explained that the recommendation remains unimplemented because 

some records were destroyed by termites.   

 

2.137 We recommended that the Management of: 
 

a. RAB VI require the concerned personnel to complete the inventory 
of all pending cases in coordination with Labor Arbiters and submit 

the updated schedule of Trust Liabilities account duly reconciled with  

the GL controlling figure; and 
 

b. RAB IX direct the Accounting Unit to prepare and maintain the 
necessary SLs of its Trust Liabilities account, as prescribed under 

Appendix 6, Volume II of the GAM for NGAs out of the schedules 

maintained. 

 

2.138 The Management of RAB IX will schedule a meeting with the Accountant-
Designate and with the Adjudication Unit to reconcile the accounting records 

with the actual status of the cases, and plan further actions to address the 

issues contributing to the non-preparation and non-maintenance of Subsidiary 

Ledgers for the Trust Liabilities account.  Management also committed to 

exert effort in reconciling the Trust Liabilities account. 

 

f.5 No separate SL for the receipt and disposition of the Execution Fees 
 

2.139 It was observed that the Accounting Unit of NLRC-CO and NCRAB failed to 
make a separate SL for the recording of receipt and disposition of the 

Execution fees as a sub-account for the controlling Trust Liabilities account, 

contrary to Section 20, Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs and Item 

D of the Instructions for the preparation of GL under Appendix 5, Volume III 

of the GAM for NGAs, which provides that controlling accounts in the GL 

shall be supported by details in the SL. Although a separate bank account has 

been dedicated as the depository of collections and disbursements for 

transactions pertaining to the execution of Judgement Awards, there was no 

SL for trust liabilities matching the transactions and the balance of 

₱6,292,807.59 of the Cash in Bank account maintained for that purpose.  

 



89 
 

2.140 Entries made in the Cash Disbursements Journal (CDJ) charged against the 
Execution Fees are debited to Trust Liabilities (UCPB Execution) to make a 

distinction with the other Trust Liabilities account pertaining to collected 

Judgment Awards but the recording of these Trust Liabilities are mixed into 

a single GL and no separate SL was prepared, defeating the purpose of having 

a separate control account. 

 

2.141 We recommended that the Management of CO and NCRAB maintain a 
separate Trust Liabilities SL for the recording of collected Execution 

Fees and expenses paid out of the Execution Fund. 
 

f.6 Unsubstantiated adjusting journal entries in Inter-Agency Payables 
 

2.142 Audit of the CO and NCRAB’s Inter-agency Payables sub-accounts Due to 
GSIS, Pag-IBIG and Due to PhilHealth disclosed adjusting entries recorded 

thru JEV No. 2020-12-476 dated December 31, 2020 without any documents 

to support its propriety and validity. These entries reduced the beginning 

balance attributed to unaccounted balances in the previous years, thus casting 

doubts on the reliability of the said accounts’ balances at yearend. Details are 

as follows: 

 
Table 26: Unsubstantiated Adjusting Entries in Inter-Agency Payables

Amount of Unsubstantiated 

Adjustments 

Due to GSIS 1,668,143.56 

Due to Pag-IBIG 345,740.22 

Due to PhilHealth 693,478.16 

Total 2,707,361.94 

 

2.143 We recommended that the Management require the Accountant and the 
Accounting personnel concerned to submit the necessary documents 

supporting  the adjusting entries made thru JEV No. 2020-12-476 dated 

December 31, 2020 under the Due to GSIS, Due to Pag-IBIG and Due to 

PhilHealth accounts to ascertain their propriety and validity. 

 

2.144 The Management commented that the journal entry was made to adjust the 
Due to GSIS, Due to Pag-IBIG and Due to PhilHealth account balances to 

their current verifiable amounts. The Agency does not have arrears based on 

the current billings of GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth, hence the excess 

amounts which have been outstanding for years and cannot be identified for 

whom they should be remitted were closed to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit). 

 

2.145 The Audit Team in CO and NCRAB does not agree with the adjustment made 
on the excess balances in the aforementioned accounts which in effect is 
tantamount to direct write-off of accounts. The Audit Team suggests that the 

Agency should secure a written confirmation from the concerned agencies 

stating that they do not have arrears.

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 

Budget Utilization 

 

3. Of the total allotments received amounting to ₱1,720,154,227.00, 
₱1,719,565,475.06 or 99.97 percent was obligated, leaving the remaining balance 

of ₱588,751.94 or only 0.03 percent unutilized. However, deficiencies in the 

preparation and submission of budgetary reports and the supporting schedules 

were observed such as: (a) errors in reporting appropriations and allotments 

resulting in understatement of the total adjusted appropriations by 

₱37,843,815.00 and obligated amounts more than the appropriations and 

allotments received; (b) discrepancies between the amounts recorded in the 

Registries of Allotments, Obligations and Disbursements (RAODs) and 

Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and 

Balances (SAAODB); (c) non-compliance with the forms for RAODs prescribed 

in Volume II of the GAM for NGAs; and (d) non-submission of reports/records 

and other documents to support the amounts reported in the SAAODB.

3.2 Gleaned from the foregoing table, the NLRC received a total allotment of 
₱1,720,154,227.00, of which ₱1,719,565,475.06 or 99.97 percent was 

obligated, leaving an unobligated amount of ₱588,751.94 or only 0.03 percent 

unutilized. 

 

3.3 Further audit revealed reportorial deficiencies, discussed in detail as follows: 
 

a. Errors in reporting appropriations and allotments resulting in 
understatement of the total adjusted appropriations by ₱37,843,815.00 

and obligated amounts more than the appropriations and allotments 

received 



91 
 

 

3.4 Under RA No. 11465, also known as the GAA for FY 2020, the NLRC had 
Current Appropriations of ₱1,242,633,000.00. It also had Automatic 

Appropriations amounting to ₱61,398,000.00, Continuing Appropriations of 

₱37,843,815.00, and Special Purpose Funds totaling ₱437,561,412.00. Thus, 

the Agency had total available appropriations of ₱1,779,436,227.00. 

However, adjustments were made which reduced the Automatic 

Appropriations by ₱44,432,000.00 thru negative Special Allotment Release 

Orders, and current appropriations for MOOE and CO in their respective 

amounts of ₱7,700,000.00 and ₱7,150,000.00, pursuant to National Budget 

Circular No. 580 dated April 22, 2020, which requires National Government 

Agencies and Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations receiving 

budgetary appropriations authorized under the FYs 2019 and 2020 GAAs to 

provide funds for the operations and response measures related to the 

COVID-19 emergency situation. Hence, the total adjusted appropriations of 

the Agency amounted to ₱1,720,154,227.00.  

 

3.5 Audit revealed that the total adjusted appropriations of ₱1,682,310,412.00 
reported in the SAAODB is understated by ₱37,843,815.00. As explained in 

the preceding paragraph, the total adjusted appropriations should have been 

₱1,720,154,227.00. The ₱37,843,815.00 understatement pertains to the 

Continuing Appropriation which was not included as part of the total adjusted 

appropriations in the SAAODB. 

 

3.6 Moreover, obligations incurred from the PS and MOOE allocations for the 
General Management and Supervision (GMS), and PS allocation for the 

Resolution of Appealed Labor Cases, were more than the appropriations and 

allotments received. Details are as follows:

3.7 Apparently, adjustments to/from appropriations and allotments were not 
properly reflected in the report which caused the excess amount of obligations 

and consequently, obtained percentages of obligations over and above 100

b. Discrepancies between the amounts reported in the RAODs and SAAODB 
 

3.8 Discrepancies were noted in the comparison between the amounts of 
obligations recorded in the RAODs and those reported in the SAAODB.

3.10 The aforementioned discrepancies imply Management’s failure to regularly 
update the RAODs which is deemed essential in easily and efficiently 

monitoring, accounting and reporting budget utilization at any given year. 

 

c. Non-compliance with the form of registries prescribed in Volume II of the 
GAM for NGAs 

 

3.11 The RAOD for PS, MOOE and CO maintained by the Management was not 
compliant with the form prescribed in Appendices 9A, 9B and 9C of Volume 

II of the GAM for NGAs. A single RAOD was prepared for all of the 

allotment class instead of one RAOD each for PS, MOOE and CO. Also, 

amount of allotments was not included in the submitted RAOD. 

 

d. Non-submission of budget reports/records and other documents to 
support the amounts reported in the SAAODB 

 

3.12 The Audit Team could not conduct further verification of the accuracy, 
completeness and propriety of the amounts reported in the SAAODB due to 

non-submission of the following: 

 

 Financial Plan (Budget Execution Document No. 1) 

 Registry of Appropriations and Allotments 

 Documents to substantiate the adjustments made in the appropriations and 
allotments 



93 
 

 

3.13 We recommended that the Management:  
 

a. cause the correction of errors noted in the appropriations and 
allotments reported in the SAAODB; 

 

b. regularly maintain and update RAODs to facilitate and efficiently 
monitor, account and report budget utilization at any given year; 

 

c. prepare registries using the prescribed format in Volume II of the 
GAM for NGAs; and 

 

d. submit the budget reports/records and other documents mentioned 
in par. 3.12 of this Report for further audit. 

 

3.14 The Management agreed with the audit observations and recommendations 
and committed to submit the required revised reports and other supporting 

documents and records. 

 

Inadequate fidelity bonds 

 

4. The approved fidelity bonds for the Cashiers of RABs IX and XI were 
insufficient, thus exceeding their maximum cash accountability, in violation of 

Section 5.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-009 dated August 6, 2009, thus exposing 

the government to risk of non-recovery of the full amount of losses of public 

funds in case of breach of fidelity. 

 

4.1 Section 5.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-009 dated August 6, 2009 provides 
that: 

 

The amount of bond shall be based on the total accountability (cash. 

property and accountable forms) of the accountable public officer as 

determined by the Head of Agency. Provided, the individual 

maximum accountability of each accountable public officer shall not 

exceed One Hundred Million Pesos (₱100M). However, the Head of 

Agency may assign to other public officers the excess accountability 

for which a separate Fidelity Bond shall be secured. 

 

4.2 The Audit Teams in RABs IX and XI conducted examination of the cash and 
accounts of their Cashiers. It was noted during the cash examination that the 

collections handled by the two Cashiers exceeded the maximum cash 

accountabilities covered by their fidelity bonds. Details are as follows:

**Total collections from October 25, 2019 to July 7, 2020 

 

4.3 Having total accountability in excess to what is covered by the bond not only 
run contrary to the rules and regulations provided in Treasury Circular No. 

02-009 dated August 6, 2009 but likewise, exposed the Agency to possible 

risk of non-indemnification in case of breach of fidelity by accountable 

officers (AOs). 

 

4.4 We recommended that the Management ensure that the Cashiers of 
RABs IX and XI are adequately bonded, in accordance with the 

provisions of Section 5.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 

6, 2009. 

 

4.5 The Management commented that: 
 

Office/RAB Management Comments/Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

CO and NCR The Management explained that the allotted budget for the payment 

of fidelity bonds to cover all AOs of the RABs is insufficient. 

However, they committed to transfer funds for the bonding of the 

AOs based on the amount of highest collection/disbursement made. 

IX Due to recent developments in online banking and the restrictions 

brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Management commented 

that most of the fees are paid by the clients directly to the bank. 

However, clients from the provinces still pay in check through the 

Cashier. In this regard, the Management will forward the concern 

to NLRC-CO to confirm whether the Cashier can still collect fees 

or all fees will totally be collected by the bank.  

XI The Management commented that the Cashier was immediately 

directed to inquire from/coordinate with the NLRC-CO on the 

matter about inadequacy of fidelity bond coverage.   

 

The following reasons of the NLRC-CO were relayed by the 

Cashier in his letter dated February 11, 2021: 

 

a.   That they have the same amount of maximum accountability; 

b.  That most of the transactions are done through LLDAP and 

ACIC; 

c.   That the collections of the regular and fiduciary funds are paid 

or tendered in the form of checks; 

d.   That it is just seldom to collect more than ₱500,000.00 in the 

form of cash; 

e.    That they are religiously depositing their daily collections on 

the next banking day.  



95 
 

Office/RAB Management Comments/Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

 

The Cashier, however, stated that they are still continuously 

coordinating with the Management in NLRC-CO on whatever 

prompt actions to be done. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

 

The Audit Team emphasized that the collection experience of one 

office or unit may not be the same as the experience of another.  The 

fact that there were instances in Region XI that the daily collections 

were more than ₱500,000.00, the Management should consider this 

in evaluating the adequacy of every AO’s bond coverage and that 

evaluation should be done regularly or before renewal of the fidelity 

bond each year. 

 

Furthermore, the NLRC RAB XI maintains bank accounts where 

the AO concerned is one of the check signatories. The funds are 

composed of cash bonds/monetary awards that were collected and 

have accumulated over a period of time.  Thus, these funds are still 

part of the signatories’ accountabilities since they continue to have 

control over the funds.   

 

It is because of these observations that the Management is being 

reminded about the risks they are taking in case of breach of fidelity.   

 

Therefore, the Audit Team reiterated that Management ascertain the 

adequacy of the fidelity bond coverages of A Os. If the said 

statements/reasons of NLRC-CO represent the standards/principles 

being applied in all other RABs that maintain judiciary funds, then 

this matter should be given proper attention. 

 

Lacking Supporting Documents in Disbursements 

 

5. The NLRC-CO and NCRAB, and six other RABs paid various transactions with 
an aggregate amount of ₱7,545,384.79 despite the absence of complete 

documents and information required to support the propriety and validity 

thereof, contrary to the provision of Section 4 of PD No. 1445. 

 

5.1 One of the fundamental principles governing financial transactions and 
operations of any government agency provided in Section 4 of PD No. 1445 

is that claims against government funds shall be supported with complete 

documentation. 

 

5.2 COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribes the documentary 
requirements for common government transactions. 

 

5.3 Post-audit of disbursements in CO and NCRAB, RABs II, V, VI, VIII, XI and 
XIII disclosed several transactions with an aggregate amount of 

₱7,545,384.79 were not fully supported with documents and information to 

establish the propriety and validity of the payments thereof. Details of the 

observations noted in said NLRC Offices are shown below:

(In PhP) 

CO and NCR The contract executed by and between the Agency and 

Wizzard Technologies, Inc. on December 13, 2019 for 

the procurement of Consulting Services and 

Development of Software for HRIS with a contract 

price of ₱489,000.00 and the partial payments of  

₱275,062.50, net of tax, were not  supported with 

complete documentary requirements prescribed in COA 

Circular Nos. 2009-001 and 2012-001 dated February 

12, 2009 and June 14, 2012, respectively, and in 2016 

Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRRs) of 

Republic Act (RA) No. 9184, hence the propriety and 

validity of the contract and related payments could not 

be fully ascertained. 

275,062.50  

II DVs, payrolls and the corresponding supporting papers 

were not stamped “PAID” in violation of COA Circular 

No. 92-389 dated November 3, 1992, thus giving rise to 

the probability of double payment and re-use of 

documents to support other claims.

Claims for monetization and travel expenses for CY 

2020 amounting to ₱1,266,322.95 and ₱61,980.00, 

respectively, were not supported with the required 

documents, contrary to the requirements of Section 4 

(6) of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001, 

thus the claims were of doubtful validity, propriety and 

accuracy. 

1,328,302.95 

Extraordinary and Miscellaneous (EME) Expenses 

totaling ₱282,000.00 for CY 2020 were claimed as 

regular monthly allowance, paid earlier during the 

intended month and without the required certification 

attached to the claim which must include the amount 

and nature of expenses incurred, contrary to the 

requirements of COA Circular No. 89-300 and the 

intention of Section 42 of GAA of FY 2020.  

282,000.00  

VI Payments of monetization of leave credits amounting to 

₱1,361,634.72 for CY 2020 were not supported with 

complete documentation, contrary to Section 4(6) of PD 

No. 1445, thus the Agency’s adherence to the guidelines 

under Section 23 and 24, Rule XVI of the Omnibus 

Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 

292 and the requirements under Section 5.14, COA 

Circular No. 2012-01 dated June 14, 2012 was not 

verified and established.

VIII Purchase Orders (PO) supporting various procurement 

did not reflect all the necessary data or information 

relative to the purchases which should invariably appear 

in said documents as provided in Item B of Appendix 

61 under Volume II of the GAM for NGAs, thus casting 

doubt on the validity, propriety and regularity of the 

transactions.

Office/RAB Observations 
Amount 

(In PhP) 

Revised Annual Procurement Plan (APP) in the 

procurement of various medical and disinfecting items 

worth ₱86,842.00 contravened the pertinent provisions 

of PD No. 1445 and the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184, 

thus rendering questions on the legality of the use of 

agency funds for said expenditures. 

XIII Disbursements under MDS Regular Fund with an 

aggregate amount of ₱4,156,340.27 disclosed 

deficiencies, which include: (a) lack of documentary 

requirements; and (b) non-submission of bank validated 

LDDAP-ADA, contrary to rules and regulations, thus 

propriety and validity of the transactions are doubtful. 

4,156,340.27  

Total 7,545,384.79  

 

5.4 Complete submission of the required documents and stamping of DVs and its 
supporting documents with the remarks “PAID” is necessary for the 

evaluation of compliance with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and 

regulations, establishing the propriety and validity of transactions entered into 

by government agencies. Disbursement of government funds for claims sans 

supporting documents would render the claims unauthorized, hence invalid. 

Moreover, unstamped DVs and supporting documents with the remark 

“PAID” may expose government funds from risk of misappropriation or 

misuse through fraudulent means. 

 

5.5 We recommended that the Management of concerned offices require the 
Accountant and concerned persons to: 

 

a. submit for further evaluation the lacking documents required to 
support the disbursements made prescribed by COA, pursuant to the 

provision of Section 4 of PD No. 1445, to avoid suspension in audit; 

 

b. conduct thorough review of the documents submitted to check their  
completeness and to ensure that all the required information are 

included therein; and 

 

c. stamp the DVs, including its supporting documents, with the remark 
“PAID” to avoid reuse of supporting documents which consequently 

result to double payment. 

 

5.6 The Management commented thus: 
 

Office/RAB Management Comments/Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

CO and 

NCR 

In its letter dated April 13, 2021, the Management commented that the 

Commission has strictly observed/complied with the basic requirements of 

the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184. It might be inadvertently 

overlooked in providing the Audit Team with complete supporting 

documents due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus in February 2020 

until the Presidential Proclamation No. 922 placing the entire Philippines 



98 
 

Office/RAB Management Comments/Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

under a state of public health emergency due to COVID-19. In effect, the 

NLRC operations along with other government offices were suspended, 

except for frontline health services from March 15, 2020 to August 18, 

2020.  However, the Management noted that in subsequent payments dated 

July 24, 2020 and August 26, 2020, it has attached the copy of the Contract 

on the HRIS project together with the Certificate of Inspection by the 

Technical Inspection Committee for other IT Services, progress billing and 

the Executive Summary Report and Project Plan/Scope of Work. 

 

In compliance with the Audit Team’s recommendation, the Management 

likewise submitted/presented the chronology of events supporting the 

procurement of the HRIS project. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

 

The Audit Team will evaluate the submitted documents, in compliance 

with our recommendations. 

II The Management commented that the Cashier was already instructed to 

strictly adhere to the provision of COA Circular No. 92-389 dated 

November 3, 1992. 

V The Management explained during the exit conference that they have 

submitted the Application for Leave of each of the claimant, to the NLRC 

Head Office because the approval for monetization is done at the Head 

Office.  It was further explained that there were no other documents 

required from them for those with more than 30 days monetization, thus 

they did not secure the documents because they have to check only the 

reason/s for their monetization application, and most of the reasons were 

due to the several typhoons that hit the region sometime in November 

2020.  

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

 

The Audit Team required the Management to request for a scanned copy 

of the duly approved Application for Leave for the said monetization from 

the NLRC Head Office and submit the said documents to the Audit Team 

not later than June 2021. 

The Management clarified that the two Labor Arbiter Associates (LAA) 

traveled to Masbate and Camarines Norte NLRC Satellite Offices to man 

the said offices for a number of days in a month. So, they queried whether 

it would suffice if the Certificate of Appearance would be obtained from 

the DOLE Provincial Field Office Head. 

The Management explained during the exit conference that they have 

started to comply with the recommendation.  They explained also the 

reason why the Labor Arbiter is also granted the EME which is intended 

only for head of the agencies.  Management also elaborated that the EME 

given to the ELA is ₱12,500.00 because the Secretary increased their EME 

by ₱1,000.00. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

 

The Audit Team will monitor compliance by the Agency.  Likewise, the 

Management was requested to provide the Audit Team the document, 

which allows the increase of the EME of ELA from ₱11,000.00 to 

₱12,500.00 because if the amount would be claimed for one year it would 



99 
 

Office/RAB Management Comments/Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

total to ₱150,000.00 which does not fall under any of the 

classification/category enumerated under Section 42 of GAA of FY 2020. 

VI The Management informed that the newly appointed Bookkeeper/Acting 

Accountant and ADOF II/Budget Officer I and all concerned personnel are 

in the process of reconciling/compiling and recovering all the supporting 

documents.  It requested the Audit Team for the latter's utmost 

consideration and understanding since the Agency is lacking of personnel 

in its Accounting Department and so with the Administrative Section.    

Nevertheless, it committed to submit reports as soon as data have been 

reconciled. 

VIII The Management noted the audit observations and recommendations. Rest 

assured that its Supply Officer-Designate will be vigilant on the processing 

and completeness of information reflected on the POs and future 

transactions will be in compliance with the provisions of GAM. It will act 

upon the recommendation in CY 2021 as the deficiencies noted existed at 

the end of audit period or as of December 31, 2020. 

XI The Management commented that they have given instructions to the 

Budget Officer to ensure that the budget documents he receives are 

properly signed and accomplished. The Management has also provided the 

Audit Team with the soft copy of the signed Sub-SAROs from the NLRC 

Central Office.  

 

A letter of explanation was also required by the Management from the 

Budget Officer, wherein, the latter stated that no funds were downloaded 

to replenish the funds spent for medical supplies. Instead, the excess funds 

under Electricity Expense were utilized for the said items, per discussion 

with the NLRC-CO. 

 

Furthermore, the Budget Officer relayed that the Chairperson only signs 

the consolidated APP, inclusive of the CO and all RABs, while the APP 

of the RAB is only approved by the ELA. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

 

The Audit Team appreciates the Management’s prompt action on some of 

the recommendations. The documents submitted by the Management and 

the claims stated by the Budget Officer will be validated. Meanwhile, 

implementation of the other recommendations will be closely monitored. 

XIII The Management agreed with the recommendations and assured 

implementation thereof. 

 

Delayed/Non-submission of Financial Reports and Records 

 

6. Financial statements, reports, records and their supporting documents were 
either submitted late or not submitted, contrary to pertinent COA rules and 

regulations, thus precluded the Audit Team to conduct timely audit of the 

Agency’s transactions and inform promptly the Management on the audit 

results for deficiencies found therein, if there are any.

financial reports, contrary to the aforementioned COA issuances. Details of 

the late submission of financial reports are as follows: 



101 
 

 
Table 33: Details of Financial Reports Not Submitted Within the Deadline 

Office/RAB 
Reports Not Submitted 

Within the Deadline 
Observation 

CO and NCR Year-end FSs, BRSs, 

RCDs and their 

supporting documents 

The complete set of the FSs of CO and 

NCRAB was duly received by the Audit 

Team only on February 22, 2021 or 22 days 

behind the deadline set in Section 60, 

Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for 

NGAs. 

 

Likewise, all of the BRSs of the eight bank 

accounts were only submitted in February 

2021, contrary to the provisions in Sections 

5 and 7, Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM 

for NGAs. 

 

Furthermore, as of April 16, 2021, the latest 

RCD, including ORs/OPs and deposit slips, 

received by the Audit Team for the 

collections without ORs was only for the 

month of October 2019 while RCD and 

ORs/OPs for collections with ORs was only 

up to the month of March 2020, thereby 

incurring 11 to 14 months of delay in the 

submission of RCDs and supporting 

documents 

IV Quarterly and Year-end 

FSs 

Soft copies of FSs for the months of January 

to June 2020 were only submitted on 

October 16, 2020. Also, the Management 

failed to submit either in soft and signed 

hard copy the required reports for the 

months of July to November 2020.  For the 

year-end FS, a soft copy was submitted on 

February 3, 2021 which was found beyond 

the deadline prescribed under Section 

60(b), Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. 

V Disbursement Vouchers 

(DVs) 

The Agency submitted the DVs on a 

monthly basis but incurred delays ranging 

from 28 days to 5 months. Also observed 

was that some DVs were unsubmitted. 

VI FSs, Budget Reports and 

BRSs 

Only the TBs were submitted among the 

monthly, quarterly required financial 

reports, whereas the year-end financial 

reports of CY 2020 lack supporting 

schedules and the condensed reports.  

 

Further verification of records disclosed 

that the BFARs were not likewise regularly 

furnished to the Office of COA – Audit 

Team Leader for CY 2020, although it was 

gathered that submissions to DBM were 

updated. 

 



102 
 

Office/RAB 
Reports Not Submitted 

Within the Deadline 
Observation 

In Sub-RAB Iloilo, BRSs were still not 

submitted. The latest submission of BRSs 

for LBP CA No. 0032-1049 was for the 

month of April 2015 and for UCPB CA No. 

20307-000226-8 was for the month of 

December 2017. 

VII FSs, DVs and their 

supporting documents 

Records show that the Agency failed to 

submit the complete set of FS for CY 2020 

within the prescribed deadline. The FSs 

were only submitted to the Audit Team on 

February 23, 2021. 

 

Moreover, DVs and their supporting 

documents totaling ₱57,801,061.65 were 

not submitted to the Audit Team as at audit 

date. 

XI POs and their supporting 

documents 

Review of POs received by the Audit Team 

revealed that out of the 47 POs issued by the 

Agency during CY 2020, 37 POs 

amounting to ₱190,656.50 were belatedly 

submitted by the Management ranging from 

1 to 56 days.  

 

Meanwhile, eight contracts with a total 

worth of ₱44,108.20 did not indicate the 

date they were received by the supplier, 

thus preventing the determination of 

whether the Management was on time or 

delayed in the submission of the POs to the 

Audit Team. 

8th Division TBs, FSs, Journal Entry 

Vouchers (JEVs), RCIs, 

RADAIs and their 

supporting documents 

Records show that financial reports from 

January to October 2020 for all funds were 

submitted late ranging from 8 to 122 days 

of delay while the November to December 

2020 accounts remained unsubmitted as at 

audit date. 

 

6.3 The delay in the submission of the aforementioned financial reports, records 
and documents precluded the Audit Teams of its timely verification and audit 

of financial transactions, and consequently, the prompt determination of 

errors/deficiencies that may be found in the course of audit, if there are any. 

 

6.4 We recommended that the Management direct the persons responsible 
in the preparation and submission of financial reports, records and 

documents to comply strictly with the deadline for submission thereof, as 

prescribed in pertinent COA issuances, enabling the Audit Teams to 

conduct timely audit which would result in prompt correction of 

identified errors/deficiencies, if there are any. 

 

6.5 The Management comments are as follows: 
 



103 
 

Office/RAB Management Comments/Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

CO and NCR The Management commented that it submitted a preliminary FS on 

February 14, 2021 and requested through a letter for an extension of 

submission until February 22, 2021. The Audit Team, however, insisted 

for the Management to submit the complete set of FSs of the NLRC 

Central Office and NCRAB within the period prescribed in the GAM for 

NGAs which is on or before January 31 of the year following the FS 

period. 

 

Moreover, it recognized that there are delays in the submission of its 

reports due to challenges brought about by the pandemic. 

IV The Management commented that the Year-End FSs for CY 2020 were 

already submitted per transmittal received dated February 5, 2021 

together with their supporting documents and received by the Audit Team 

on the same date.  

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

 

However, the quarterly Financial Statements stated in the audit 

recommendation were still not submitted to the Audit Team. Monitoring 

of the full compliance will be continuously done by the Audit Team.  

V The Management explained that some DVs cannot be submitted on time 

because some claimants for the awards of won labor cases were not able 

to claim immediately the checks, like those claimants who were in Manila 

already, thus some checks become stale. But they committed to comply 

with the recommendations. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

 

The Audit Team suggested that the Cashier should inform the payees of 

the checks to avoid checks becoming stale. Compliance to the 

recommendations will be monitored by the Audit Team. 

VI The Management replied that all concerned personnel are in the process 

of reconciling all necessary documents. It further commented that it lacks 

personnel in its Accounting Department. The Bookkeeper/Acting 

Accountant and Budget Officer are now exerting efforts to keep up with 

the deadlines and to cope up with the scheduled time table set.  It will be 

submitting their reports as soon as the data are reconciled. 

XI The Management commented that they have received the Supply 

Officer’s letter of explanation dated February 9, 2021 pertaining to the 

above audit observation. The Supply Officer committed in her letter that 

POs will be properly accomplished and submitted to the Office of the 

Auditor without delay. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

 

The Audit Team appreciates the Management’s proactiveness and swift 

action on the recommendations, as proven by the immediate submission 

of the latest POs to the Team’s electronic mail. The Audit Team will 

monitor Management’s consistent compliance with the requirements of 

COA Circular No. 2009-001. 

8th Division The Management explained that the delay in the submission of financial 

reports was due to the following reasons: (1) (COVID-19) that triggered 

the declaration of General Community Quarantine (GCQ) or Modified 

General Community Quarantine (MGCQ) which led to the adoption of 

the work-from-home and/or flexible work arrangement that means the 



104 
 

Office/RAB Management Comments/Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

accountable officers were not required to report for work on regular basis; 

(2) there was delay of Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) with the ADA; 

and (3) its service providers did not give the receipts on time. The 

Management committed to exert all diligent efforts to avoid the situation 

in the future. 

 

 

Unremitted Interest Income 

 

7. Interests earned on deposits under RAB III’s UCPB Account No. 220-117299-2 
amounting to ₱359,592.58 as of December 31, 2020 were not remitted to the 

National Treasury, contrary to the provisions of Section 4 of RA No. 11465, or 

the GAA for FY 2020, and Section 65 of PD No. 1445.  

 

7.1 Section 4 of the GAA for 2020 provides that, as a general rule, all fees, 
charges, assessments, and other receipts or revenues collected by 

departments, bureaus and offices of the National Government, including 

Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy in the exercise of their 

mandated functions, at such rates as are now or may be approved by the 

appropriate approving authority shall be deposited to the National Treasury 

as income of the General Fund pursuant to Section 44, Chapter 5, Book VI of 

EO No. 292, series of 1987 and Section 65 of PD No. 1445.  Exceptions are 

the foregoing: 

 

(a) Receipts authorized by law to be recorded as a Special Account in the 
General Fund, Trust Fund, or a fund other than the General Fund which 

shall be established in accordance with rules and regulations as may be 

issued by the Permanent Committee (the “Permanent Committee”) 

created under Section 45, Chapter 5, Book VI of E.O. No. 292.  The said 

special funds may be made available for expenditure, subject to any 

special provision of the agencies concerned; and 

 

(b) Other instances authorized by law. 
 

Disbursements or expenditures by agencies from use or retention of 

income absent the above legal authority or from income deposited outside 

of the National Treasury without legal basis shall be void and shall subject 

the erring officials and employees to disciplinary actions in accordance 

with Section 43, Chapter 5, and Section 80, Chapter 7, Book VI of E.O. 

No. 292, and to appropriated criminal action under existing law. 

 

7.2 Moreover, Section 65 of PD No. 1445 states, among others, that unless 
otherwise specifically provided by law, income accruing to the agencies by 

virtue of the provisions of law, orders and regulations shall be deposited in 

the National Treasury or in any duly authorized government depository, and 



105 
 

shall accrue to the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund of the 

Government.   

 

7.3 Audit of the Cash accounts of RAB III disclosed that it failed to deposit to the 
National Treasury the interest income earned under UCPB Account No. 220-

117299-2 amounting to ₱359,592.58, as of December 2020,   contrary to the 

abovementioned provisions of law.  According to the concerned personnel,  

they were not aware of the said requirement,  thus the said interest income  

was not deposited to the National Treasury. 

 

7.4 We recommended that the Management remit the interest income earned 
amounting to ₱359,592.58 to the National Treasury, in compliance with 

the provision of Section 4 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 

2020 and Section 65 of PD No. 1445. 
 

7.5 The Agency Head ordered the Accounting and Cashiering personnel of RAB 
III for the settlement of the interest income under UCPB Account No. 220-

117299-2 as of the quarter ending December 31, 2020 amounting to 

₱359,592.58. Similar directive was issued to the concerned officials to strictly 

adhere to the provisions of Section 4 of the GAA and Section 65 of PD No. 

1445 and remit all interest earned to the National Treasury. 

 

PROGRAM EVALUATION 

 

Accomplishments below targets for CY 2020 

 

8. Only the output indicator for appealed cases affirmed before higher authorities 
with a target of 98 percent was achieved with accomplishment rate of 99 percent, 

while targets for the three outcome/output performance indicators in the FY 

2020 GAA for the implementation of the Agency’s Labor Arbitration Program 

were not attained due to the implementation of Alternative Work Arrangements 

(AWA) with only skeletal workforce which reduced office hours during the 

COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Only (a) 56 percent decrease, as against the 

target  of 61 percent increase in the cases resolved through conciliation-

mediation was accomplished;  (b) 85 percent of original or appealed cases, as 

opposed to the 96 percent target, were decided within the nine-month process 

cycle time (PCT) for the  RABs and six-month PCT for the Commission Proper 

(CP); and (c) 43 percent of cases, which is below the 69 percent target, were 

resolved within three months from filing thereof. 

 

8.1 The NLRC is a quasi-judicial body tasked to promote and maintain industrial 
peace based on social justice by resolving labor and management disputes 

involving both local and overseas workers through compulsory arbitration 

and other alternative modes of dispute resolution.

69% 43%  (26%) 

d. Percentage of decisions affirmed by a higher 
court 

98% 99.25% 1.25% 

 

8.3 Reports of the program’s implementation for CY 2020 showed that of the four 
performance indicators, only the target for performance indicator- percentage 

of decisions affirmed by a higher court  was achieved by the Agency  while 

the targets for the three other performance indicators were not attained,  

discussed as follows: 

 

a. Percentage of decisions affirmed by  a higher court 

 

8.4 During the year, 4,134 of its decided cases were appealed by the concerned 
parties to higher authorities, one of which is the Court of Appeals. Of the said 

number of cases, 4,103 or 99.25 percent were affirmed. Thus, the NLRC 

achieved and exceeded its target of 98 percent, the percentage of its decisions 

affirmed by a higher authority, an indication of the Commission’s Labor 

Arbiters’ diligence in their work performance. 

 

b. Percentage increase in cases resolved through conciliation-mediation 

 

8.5 Labor dispute may be resolved thru amicable settlement during the mandatory 
conciliation-mediation conference, and if not, both parties shall submit their 

verified position papers to the Labor Arbiter in order to promulgate a decision. 

 

8.6 Under its Double-Barreled Conciliation-Mediation Program for CY 2020, the 
NLRC targeted a percentage increase of 61 percent in cases resolved through 

conciliation-mediation. Agency data showed that 11,219 cases were resolved 

out of the 21,181 labor disputes through conciliation-mediation during the 

year which benefited a total of 11,725 workers with settlement award of 

₱1,414,903,459.62. 

 

8.7 Comparison between the cases resolved in CYs 2019 and 2020 under the said 
program is presented in the next page.

2020 11,219 

Increase/(Decrease) in Quantity (14,302) 

Increase/(Decrease) in Percentage (56) 

 

8.8 From the foregoing table, there was a decrease in the settled cases by 
approximately 56 percent, compared to the outcome indicator target of an 

increase in percentage by 61 percent. 

 

8.9 It was observed, however, that the Management has not properly applied the 
output indicator as a factor in determining the accomplishment of target. 

Based on the 2020 Programs/Project Beneficiaries (Fourth Quarter, 2020), an 

accomplishment report published in the Agency’s website, the actual 

accomplishment on this specific performance indicator was computed using 

the actual settled cases as numerator and total handled cases under 

compulsory arbitration as denominator which would result in the percentage 

of cases settled under the Double-Barreled Conciliation-Mediation Program 

and not the percentage increase in cases resolved through the said program. 

 

c. Percentage of original/appealed cases processed within nine (9) months 
or 270 days / six (6) months or 180 days 

 

8.10 The RAB Compulsory Arbitration involves the resolution of labor disputes in 
the fairest, quickest, least expensive and most effective way possible. As 

provided in Section 4, Rule IV of the NLRC Rules of Procedure on the 

Disposition of Cases, subject to the provisions of Article 263(g) of the Labor 

Code, as amended, when a case is assigned to a Labor Arbiter, the entire case 

and any or all incidents thereto shall be considered assigned to him/her; the 

same shall be disposed of in the same proceedings to avoid multiplicity of 

suits or proceedings. 

 

8.11 On the other hand, the Appellate Level involves the resolution of cases 
decided by the Labor Arbiters assigned at RABs in the Compulsory 

Arbitration that are appealed before the CP.  Section 1 of Rule VI stipulates 

the Period of Appeals.  Decision, awards or orders of the Labor Arbiter shall 

be final and executory unless appealed to the Commission by any or both 

parties within 10 calendar days from receipt thereof, and in case of decisions 

or resolutions of the Regional Director of the Department of Labor and 

Employment (DOLE) pursuant to Article 129 of the Labor Code, within five 

calendar days from receipt thereof. 

 

8.12 For performance indicator (b), the NLRC implemented the Project Speedy 
and Efficient Delivery of Labor Justice (SpeED), which prescribes the 

periods-Process Cycle Time (PCT) of deciding labor cases brought to the 



108 
 

RABs and Appellate Level under its compulsory arbitration services.  For the 

RABs, the PCT is nine months while for the appealed cases at the CP, the 

PCT is six months. 

 

8.13 Moreover, NLRC En Banc Resolution No. 13-07, series of 2007 requires each 
Labor Arbiter of the RABs to observe the quota system (27 cases per month) 

and the aging of cases system of no more than nine-month old cases, “First In 

First Out” (FIFO) policy.  In case of failure to comply with this policy, the 

Representation and Transportation Allowance of the Labor Arbiter is 

withheld and released only upon compliance with the quota and aging system. 

If the Labor Arbiter fails to comply with the said performance standard for 

seven consecutive months, an administrative complaint will be filed before 

the Board of Inquiry (BOI) on the ground of gross neglect of duties.  

 

8.14 Under Project SpeED, the Agency processed a total of 23,907 out of 28,016 
original/appealed cases within the nine-month PCT or 270 days / six-month 

PCT or 180 days, equivalent to an overall percentage of 85, falling short by 

11 percent against the target of 96 percent. Individually, only RABs CAR, V, 

VIII, IX, X, XII and XIII, and SRABs Naga, Iloilo/Aklan, Tagbilaran, 

Dipolog, CAU and General Santos exceeded the target, as shown in Table 35

8.16 According to Management, the non-attainment of the three FY 2020 targets 
for the aforementioned outcome/output performance indicators under the 

Labor Arbitration Program was mainly attributed to the Agency 

implementation of AWA with only skeletal workforce which reduced office 

hours during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Despite the situation, NLRC 

still managed to cope up and was able to deliver with the help of the Project 

SpeED strategy and the policy of the Commission requiring each Labor 

Arbiter of the RABs to observe the quota system and imposing sanctions for 

non-compliance thereof, as discussed in the preceding paragraphs. However, 

the advent of the pandemic could serve as a leeway for the Management to 

formulate or design strategies to improve its performance, incorporating 

flexibility in facing the challenges posed by the pandemic, that could diminish, 

if not eliminate, the risk of non-attainment of the targets due to ineffective 

implementation of the Agency’s programs in the event of adversities like the 

COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

8.17 Although majority of the targets on the outcome/output indicators for 
the implementation of the Labor Arbitration Program was not achieved 

in CY 2020, we still commended the Agency for exerting efforts to carry 

on with the implementation of its programs despite the challenges caused 

by the pandemic in CY 2020. However, we recommended that the 

Management: 

 

a. apply the target outcome/output indicator as a factor in reporting the 
accomplishment on the Double-Barreled Conciliation-Mediation 

Program based on the percentage increase in cases resolved which 

requires the comparison between the number of cases resolved 

through conciliation-mediation in the previous and current year; and 

 

b. formulate or design strategies, in addition to those currently applied 
by the Agency, to improve its performance and reach the succeeding 

years’ targets taking into consideration the management of risks in 

times of adversities such as the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

8.18 The Management agreed with the audit observations and recommendations. 
However, the Management requests the Audit Team to consider its 

justifications, as follows: 

 

8.19 The processes of the NLRC on labor dispute resolution are greatly affected 
by the pandemic.  Despite the adoption of minimum standard of health and 

safety sanctioned by the government to enhance the Agency’s performance 

level, the following factors slowed its processes and caused the non-

achievement of our performance targets, to wit: 

 

 



111 
 

RABs and CP 

 

 COVID-19 pandemic, which caused loss of man hours due to suspension 
of work during the implementation of Community Quarantine.  Thus, 

NLRC’s operations were halted for more than two months.   

 

 Implementation of AWA (combination of Skeleton Workforce and Work-
from-Home) of the NLRC employees. Due to this, there was a delay in 

the preparation of summonses, notices of hearings and release of 

Decisions and Orders. 

 

 Suspension of Mandatory Conciliation-Mediation Conferences to avoid 
face-to-face transactions.   Thus, the parties are not given the opportunity 

to settle their dispute amicably.  The parties cannot likewise identify or 

limit the issues or enter into stipulations of facts. 

 

 Difficulty in securing legal assistance on the part of the workers due to 
suspension of work of the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) and accredited 

legal clinics.  This prevented the Complainants from filing their pleadings 

on time.  There was also extension of period for filing of pleadings which 

affects the Process Cycle Time (PCT) of case resolution. 

 

 Pleadings cannot be submitted/filed personally due to health hazards.  
Thus, this caused the delay in the resolution of cases. 

 

 Delay in the postal services. 
 

On appealed cases, we also experienced the following challenges: 

 

 Delay in the elevation of appealed cases from the RABs to the CP due to 
limited workforce and travel restrictions. 

 

 Appeals may not be perfected due to difficulty of securing and posting of 
the required Appeal Bonds.  Operations of the Bonding Companies are 

suspended.  Thus, the substantive merit of the case cannot be considered. 

 

 The Decision of the Commission is collegial in nature; hence the 
Commissioners are required by law and the NLRC Rules of Procedure to 

undertake consultation with the members of the Division before a decision 

is reached.  At present, face-to-face consultation is not advisable 

considering that most of the Commissioners are either suffering from 

comorbidities or are in their senior years.

OTHER COMPLIANCE ISSUES 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

9. The implementation of GAD related programs, projects and activities (PPAs) in 
NLRC was not fully  carried out as required in Section 31 of the General 

Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 due to the following: (a) GAD funds 

allocation below five percent of appropriation by attribution; (b) non-

accomplishment of PPAs related to GAD in RABs IV, VII, X and Eighth 

Division mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and (c) other procedural 

deficiencies thus, the program’s aim of addressing gender issues to ensure 

women’s complete participation in development and nation-building was not 

fully attained in CY 2020. 

 

9.1 RA No. 7192, otherwise known as the Women in Development and Nation 
Building Act, is the basis for long-term plans to address gender issues which 

directs all government agencies to institute measures that would eliminate 

gender bias in government policies, programs and projects to ensure women’s 

complete participation in development and nation-building.  

 

9.2 Section 31 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 under RA No. 
11260 reads: 

 

All agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed 

to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and 

implement the applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna 

Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 

Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform of Action, the 

Philippines Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025), 

and the Philippine Development Plan. 

 

The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 

agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. 

For this purpose, activities currently undertaken by agencies which 

relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic 

empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, 

promotion and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of 

gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance 

with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget shall be 

evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said 

agencies. 

 

9.3 Section 6.1 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 dated April 05, 
2012 provides that: 

 



113 
 

At least five percent (5%) of the total agency budget appropriations 

authorized under the annual GAA shall correspond to activities 

supporting GAD plans and programs.  The GAD budget shall be 

drawn from the agency’s MOOE, CO, and PS.  It is understood that 

the GAD budget does not constitute an additional budget over an 

agency’s total budget appropriations. 

 

9.4 The preparation and submission of the annual GPB and Annual GAD AR 
shall be guided by JC No. 2012-01 as well as other guidelines on GAD 

Planning and Budgeting that may be issued by the appropriate oversight 

agencies. PCW-NEDA DBM JC No. 2012-01 requires the preparation and 

submission of the Annual GPB by the GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) of 

each agency to the PCW, the lead agency in setting the priority agenda for 

women’s empowerment and gender equality, for review prior to the 

submission of the Agency budget proposal to the DBM. Item 7(v) of said JC 

set the submission of the GPB to PCW on January (one year before budget 

year). The PCW-endorsed GPB shall serve as the basis for implementing the 

GPB as well as monitoring and reporting. 

 

9.5 Section 4.4 of PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 on the institutionalization 
of the GAD Database/sex-disaggregated data (SDD) states that the agency 

shall develop or integrate in its existing database GAD information to include 

gender statistics and sex-disaggregated data that have been systematically 

produced or gathered as inputs or bases for planning, budgeting, 

programming, and policy formulation. 

 

9.6 COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 requires the Agency to 
submit a copy of the annual GPB to the Audit Team assigned to the Agency 

within five working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the PCW 

or their mother or central offices as the case maybe. Likewise, a copy of the 

corresponding GAD AR shall be furnished the Audit Team within five 

working days from the end of January of the preceding year.  

 

9.7 For CY 2020, the NLRC-CO, RABs NCR, CAR, I, II, V and Seventh Division 
allocated funds amounting to at least ₱9,725,453.43 for GAD PPAs but failed 

to comply with the five percent allocation required in Section 31 of the 

General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 as the allotted budget equated to 

merely 0.58 percent of the total adjusted appropriation of the NLRC 

amounting to ₱1,682,310,412.00. Details are as follows:

GAD PPAs. However, its GAD AR 

reported a total of ₱64,416.12 incurred 

in the implementation of GAD PPAs. 

I                      -        104,312.80  The Agency integrated GAD in the 

implementation of their PPAs such as 

gathering of sex-disaggregated data on 

workers filing complaints. They also 

attended GAD Program virtual 

seminars spearheaded by NLRC-CO. It 

also participated in Women’s Month 

Celebration. 

II     240,801.40      361,151.41  The Agency prepared its GPB for the 

implementation of GAD-related 

activities for CY 2020 amounting to 

only ₱240,801.40 while the actual 

amount spent for its implementation 

was ₱361,151.41. 

V        90,000.00   -  The Agency budgeted only the amount 

of ₱90,000.00 for GAD PPAs.

NLRC RAB VI certified that budget 

for GAD of the Agency of P69,000.00 

was 100% reverted to NLRC Main 

Office Manila in compliance with the 

National Budget Circular No. 580 

dated April 22, 2020. 

7th Division                      -           34,306.68  The GAD AR of the Agency showed 

minimal utilization of ₱34,306.68 for 

GAD PPAs. 

Total  9,725,453.43   9,779,509.51    

 

9.8 Moreover, the GAD AR of the NLRC-CO, RABs NCR, I and Seventh 
Division showed that some GAD PPAs were not accomplished due to the 

onslaught of COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the NLRC Offices/RABs, 

except RABs IV, VII, X and Eighth Division, implemented PPAs related to 

GAD. 
 

9.9 Other procedural deficiencies noted in the audit of GAD implementation are 
as follows: 

 
Table 39: Other Deficiencies Related to the Implementation of GAD PPAs 

Office/ 

RAB 
Observations 

III The Agency failed to implement and adapt the relevance and impact of the 

use of SDD in the reporting of the cases it has handled and disposed of, as 



115 
 

Office/ 

RAB 
Observations 

required by RA No. 9710, which resulted in the lost opportunity to incorporate 

said programs to its GAD accomplishments. 

V The GAD Focal Point of the Agency is not familiar with the “attribution” of 

expenses to GAD  activities as manifested in the GAD Accomplishment 

Report which did not indicate any cost incurred for the GAD trainings 

attended. 

IX No GPB and GAD AR were prepared and submitted for CY 2020. The non-

preparation of these reports is mainly attributed to the retirement of the GAD 

Focal Person as well as the impact of the pandemic. 

XI The Agency’s CY 2020 GPB and GAD AR manifested several flaws that may 

be attributed to lack of capacitating the RAB’s Focal Person/s on the task of 

gender mainstreaming in their office, contrary to the pertinent provisions of 

IRR of the Magna Carta of Women, PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2011-

01, COA Circular No. 2014-001, PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Memorandum 

Circular No. 2012-01, thus resulting in non-implementation of gender-

responsive programs, projects and activities promoting gender equality and 

women empowerment. 

XIII The Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) tool was not 

used for each Major Final Output (MFOs)/major program/project, thus failing 

to integrate gender equality perspective into the preparation, design, 

implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies, regulatory measures, 

spending programs resulting in non-determination of attribution cost of major 

programs to GPB and GAD AR and level of GAD responsiveness cannot be 

evaluated. 

 

9.10 We recommended that the Management:  
 

a. formulate more GAD programs, projects and activities or consider 
conducting a seminar on attribution of GAD expenditures in the 

Agency’s major programs, projects and activities to acquire 

awareness and practice proper attribution in the GAD budget of a 

portion or the whole of the annual budget of the Agency’s major 

programs through the administration of HGDG which could aid in 

reporting in the GAD AR a more accurate amount of GAD-related 

expenditures and boost the utilization of the Agency’s GAD budget, 

in compliance with the requirement of at least five percent of the total 

appropriations provided in Section 31 of the General Provisions of 

the GAA for FY 2020, and ultimately, to address the identified gender 

issues; 

 

b. develop, install and maintain GAD database/sex-disaggregated data 
as bases or inputs for planning, budgeting, programming and policy-

formulation; and 

 

c. prepare and submit the required GPB and GAD AR, in accordance 
with guidelines set forth under PCW-NEDA-DBM JC 2012-01 and 

submit a copy to NLRC-CO and other government oversight bodies, 

as appropriate.

9.11 The Management comments are as follows: 
 

Office/RAB Management Comments/Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

CO and 

NCR 

The Management agreed with the audit observations and 

recommendations.  However, it pointed out the following justifications: 

 

a. NLRC’s substantial compliance with Section 31 of the General 
Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020, which is to allocate at least five 

percent of the Agency’s budget for GAD program and integrate the 

same with the regular activities and program in the accomplishment of 

the agency’s mandate, to wit: 

 

 Provision of clinic which serves also as the lactation room for 
mother women stakeholders 

 Conduct of series of orientations on GAD sensitivity. 

 Provision for priority lane for pregnant women and women with 
special concern in the filing of Request for Assistance at Single 

Entry Unit (SEnA) and filing of complaint at the Complaint Unit. 

 As gender sensitive agency, facilities are improved, like provision 
of purified water at the common area of SEnA and Complaint Unit 

for stakeholders; comfort rooms; ventilation and installation of 

air-conditioning units at the 3rd Floor lobby as the waiting area of 

parties while on queue for the conference and hearing of their case 

to address issues on GAD and Senior Citizens. 

 Signage (as reminder) to prioritize pregnant women, differently 
abled stakeholders and Senior Citizens to all NLRC facilities. 

 Provision of benefits to officials and employees who are entitled 
to maternity leave, paternity leave and Magna Carta benefits; and 

 Collection of sex-disaggregated data for labor cases handled. 
 

b. If the NLRC literally allot five percent of its budget dedicated for GAD 
Plans and Programs, and without integrating it with NLRC activities 

and programs, it could impair the real intent of the GAA and may 

negatively impact the delivery of our basic services and the 

accomplishment of our performance targets and Major Final Outputs 

it committed under the GAA.  For CY 2020, NLRC was provided with 

a total budget per GAA of ₱1,242,633,000.00, which consists of PS, 

₱1,031,741,000.00 (83.03%), MOOE, ₱201,237,000.00 (16.19%) and 

CO, ₱9,655,000.00 (0.78%). Based on this, five percent of the 

Agency’s total budget is equivalent to ₱62,6131,650.00 or 30.87 

percent  of its total allocation for MOOE. This amount cannot be taken 

from the budget allocated for PS and CO since these are fixed and for 

specific purposes. On the other hand, our MOOE includes fixed and 

necessary expenditures such as office rentals, utilities, postage and 

stamps and extraordinary expenses, thus leaving a very minimal 

amount for other expenditures. With this budget constraint, the NLRC 

cannot allocate at least five percent of its budget dedicated solely to 

GAD Programs outside the regular programs and activities in 

pursuance to the accomplishment of our mandate. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

 

The Audit Team, however, emphasized that the allocation for the minimum 

requirement of five percent budget for GAD programs, projects or 



117 
 

Office/RAB Management Comments/Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

activities is thru the attribution on the Agency’s regular programs, projects 

or activities. The GAD Focal Point System should attend seminars 

regarding the HGDG to obtain awareness on the procedures to be 

undertaken on GAD attribution. 

III Appropriate directives will be issued to ensure that relevant data are 

available to reflect the impact of our mandates to the lives of vulnerable 

people in line with our GAD Accomplishments as required by RA No. 

9710.  

IX Due to the retirement of the former GAD Focal personnel and changes in 

the designations of several employees which entail adjustment to their 

newly assigned designations, the submission of GPB and GAD AR was 

overlooked. Nevertheless, Management will coordinate with NLRC 

Central Office for the final GPB of NLRC RAB IX. Further, the 

Management committed to submit their GAD AR for CY 2020 and ensure 

to prepare and submit GPB and GAD AR for CY 2021. 

XI The Management commented that the GAD Focal Person of RAB XI 

retired on December 1, 2020 and that the ELA will have to create a GAD 

Planning Committee to be able to come up with gender-responsive 

programs, projects and activities of the Office. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder 

 

The Audit Team shall monitor developments on the creation of the 

Regional GFPS and its performance of GAD responsibilities to ascertain 

that the GAD issues identified have been properly addressed and that RAB 

XI is able to implement gender-responsive PPAs. 

XIII The Management commented that they will still have to refer the matter to 

their NLRC-CO as GAD Plan of their Agency is prepared in the CO. The 

Management, however, concurred with the recommendation. 

 

 

Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability   

 

10. The NLRC-CO and NCRAB, as well as RABs I, II, IX and XII, were able to 
implement and undertake programs, projects and activities for the Senior 

Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) in accordance with Section 

32, General Provisions, RA No. 11465, or the General Appropriations Act 

(GAA) for FY 2020.  However, RABs III, IV, VII, VIII and Seventh Division 

were not able to implement programs and projects for Senior Citizens and 

PWDs. 
 

10.1 Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, otherwise known as 
the GAA for FY 2020, provides that: 

 

All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and 

projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and 

persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated 

functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.  

 



118 
 

Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide 

architectural or structural features, designs, or facilities that will 

reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with 

disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 or RA No. 7277, as 

amended. 

  

10.2 The activities, programs and projects undertaken by NLRC-CO and RABs I, 
II, IX and XII intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons 

with disability were as follows: 

 
Table 40: PPAs Implemented for Senior Citizens and PWDs 

Office/RAB Programs, Projects and Activities 

CO and NCR A. PROGRAMS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS/OLDER PEOPLE 
1. Participation to Trainings and Seminar/s for Senior Citizens 

 Zoomba at Iba Pa: For Senior Citizens on September 8, 
2020   

(16 participants, facilitated by the Institute for Labor 

Studies)    

2. Continuous Implementation of priority service to PWDs, 
pregnant women and senior citizens 

3. Provision of quality assistance to NLRC retirees for 
documentary requirements 

 

B. PROGRAMS FOR PWDs/UNDERPRIVILEGED 
1. Promoting accessibility of PWDs to office premises (availability 

of elevators, PWD toilets, handrails, ramps, etc.) 

2. Continuous Implementation of priority service/lanes to PWDs, 
pregnant women and SCs. 

3. Provision of immediate assistance to PWD clients 

I The Agency provided priority lanes for the exclusive use of senior citizens, 

persons with disabilities (PWDs) or medical conditions, and pregnant 

women.  A number of Sheriffs are  Senior Citizens/ PWDs. 

II The Agency implemented the following activities for SCs and PWDs: 

 

1. Pathway and Railings were provided in the Office for SCs, PWDs and 
Pregnant Women. 

2. The same number of employees were assigned to assist the SCs, 
PWDs and Pregnant Women in terms of services, such as giving them 

priority, provision of seats and Comfort Room. 

3. Provision of parking space/s for PDWs and SCs. 
4. Signages were installed in our Office for these types of clients.    
5. Accommodate CSs, PWDs and Pregnant Women with SPA for case 

follow- ups considering the pandemic situation. 

IX The Agency had substantially complied with the requirements set forth in 

Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 and integrated 

mechanisms that properly address the concerns of SCs and PWDs. 

XII Despite of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Management strived in initiating 

actions to cater to the SCs and PWDs. The Management rented an 

additional space on the Ground Floor of their building to cater to the SCs 

and PWDs responsively without making them walk going to the Main 

Office at the Second Floor. Moreover, the Management is consistent in 

providing priority lane to the members of the senior citizens and PWDs 

who went to their office. 



119 
 

 

10.3 However, RABs III, IV, VII, VIII and Seventh Division were not able to 
implement programs and projects for SCs and PWDs, contrary to Section 32 

of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, or the GAA of FY 2020. 

 

10.4 We recommended that the Management of RABs III, IV, VII, VIII and 
Seventh Division formulate plans and implement programs and projects 

intended to address the concerns of Senior Citizens and PWDs programs 

and projects, as mandated by Section 32 of the General Provisions of the 

GAA for FY 2020. 

 

10.5 The Management comments are as follows: 
 

Office/RAB Management Comments 

III The present Agency Head recognizes the omission of previous 

Management and is now in the process of formulating year-long plans, 

programs and projects and allocating funds intended to address the 

concerns of SCs and PWDs, insofar as it relates to our mandated 

functions, and integrate the same in our regular activities.  Immediate 

roll-out of the plans will be undertaken. 

VIII For the Calendar Year 2021, Management through its GAD Focal 

Person, identified the specific plans, programs and   projects intended to 

address the concerns of SCs and PWDs in accordance with the Agency’s 

mandated functions and will integrate the same in our regular activities, 

as required by law to enhance the mobility, safety, and welfare of the 

SCs and PWDs.  

 

 

Compliance with Property Insurance Law 

 

11. A total insurable assets of ₱7,890,949.98 in NLRC-CO and RABs NCR, I, IV 
and XII were not insured under the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the 

Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) for CY 2020, contrary to Sections 

5 and 4(c) of RA No. 656 or the Property Insurance Law and paragraphs 3.1 

and 3.2 of COA Circular No. 92-390, thus exposing risk of not being indemnified 

in the event of loss and/or damage to such properties. 

 

11.1 RA No. 656 or the Property Insurance Law was created to establish a 
“Property Insurance Fund” which administration was placed under the GSIS. 

It was amended by PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973, which requires all 

government agencies to have their insurable properties, assets, and interests 

insured with the GIF administered by the GSIS to ensure compensation of the 

equivalent value thereof in case of loss thru fire, theft or any unforeseen 

events. 

 

11.2 Sections 5 and 4(c) of RA No. 656, as amended, state that:  
 



120 
 

Every government, except a municipal government below first class, 

is hereby required to insure its properties, with the Fund against any 

insurable risk herein provided and pay the premiums thereon, which, 

however, shall not exceed the premiums charged by private insurance 

companies. 

 

11.3 Section 3.1 of COA Circular No. 92-390 dated November 17, 1992 provides 
that all Heads of national agencies, local government units and GOCCs shall 

be responsible for the preparation and submission of the inventory of all 

insurable physical assets, while Section 3.2 thereof requires such inventory 

report as at year-end to be submitted to the GSIS not later than October 31 of 

the ensuing year. 

 

11.4 Insurable assets with an indicative total cost of ₱7,890,949.98 in NLRC-CO 
and RABs NCR, I, IV and XII, except for the Motor Vehicles of NLRC-CO 

and RABs NCR and XII, were not provided with property insurance, exposing 

them to risk of not being compensated in the case of fire, theft and other 

unforeseen events. Details are as follows:

I 253,410.84 

IV No data provided 

XII 827,418.62 

Total 7,890,949.98 

 

11.5 The occurrence of the pandemic was the common reason that precluded RAB 
I to have their properties insured. 

 

11.6 On the other hand, RABs XI and IX were able to insure its properties in their 
respective amounts of ₱13,019.25 and ₱8,842.37. 

 

11.7 We recommended that the Management of NLRC-CO and RABs NCR, 
I, IV and XII secure insurance of its properties under the GIF of the GSIS 

in compliance with Sections 5 and 4(c) of RA No. 656 or the Property 

Insurance Law. 

 

11.8 The Management of NLRC-CO and NCRAB wrote to GSIS on January 4, 
2021 to request for the renewal of the insurance of PPE. However, as of this 

date the GSIS has not yet acted on its request despite numerous telephone 

calls, office visits and emails.

Compliance with Tax Laws 

 

12. NLRC-CO and RABs had complied with the remittance of taxes withheld from 
suppliers, compensation of employees and collection of judgement awards for 

CY 2020 in compliance with Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 23-2007 dated 

March 23, 2007 and BIR Tax Revenue Regulation No. 10-2008 dated July 8, 

2008, except for the non-withholding by RAB XIII of appropriate taxes totalling 

₱9,605.13 for the payment of ₱153,682.00 for postage and courier services to 

Philippine Postal Corporation (PPC).   

 

12.1 EO No. 651 dated February 16, 1981 requires every government office or 
agency to show full and faithful compliance with the tax laws and regulations 

and serve as a model to the paying public. Such directive was reiterated under 

BIR Revenue Regulations No. 1-87 dated April 2, 1987 and BIR Revenue 

Memorandum No. 8-2003 dated March 3, 2001. 

 

12.2 Verification of DVs of RAB XIII for CY 2020 disclosed that payments to 
PPC for postage and courier services totaling ₱153,682.00 were not deducted 

with the required withholding taxes of 5% VAT and 2% Expanded 

Withholding Tax amounting to ₱6,860.80 and ₱2,744.32, respectively, or a 

total of ₱9,605.13, which is not in conformity with the mentioned tax revenue 

regulations.  

 

12.3 Except for the non-withholding of taxes for the payments made to PPC, the 
NLRC-CO and its RABs faithfully complied with the rules and regulations of 

the BIR on the withholding and remittances of taxes, shown as follows:

mostly  the December 2020 deductions which were remitted immediately in January 

2021.  

 

12.5 We recommended that Management of RAB XIII direct the Accounting 
Unit to religiously withhold taxes on payment for courier services and 

remit the same to the BIR.  

 

12.6 The Management of NLRC RAB XIII agreed with the recommendations and 
withholding of taxes from payments to PPC was already effected. 

 

 

Compliance with RA No. 8291 or the GSIS Act of 1997  

 

13. The NLRC and its RABs deducted from the salaries of its personnel and 
remitted to GSIS within the prescribed period the required Life and Retirement 

Premium share of employees, Government Share, and Employee Loans 

Repayment Amortization, in compliance with Section 6(b) of RA No. 8291 or the 

GSIS Act of 1997. 

 

13.1 Relative thereto, Section 14 of the Revised IRR of GSIS Act of 1997 (RA No. 
8291) states, thus: 

 

14.2. The government agency shall also deduct from the fixed 

monthly compensation of the employee the loan amortizations 

(consolidated loans, policy loan, emergency loan, housing loan and 

other loans), premium payments (optional, pre-need and other non-

life insurance) and other amounts due the GSIS. 

 

14.3. The said amounts shall be remitted to the GSIS within the first 

Ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month when the 

deductions were effected, accompanied by supporting lists in the form 

prescribed by the GSIS. 

 

13.2 The NLRC-CO and its RABs compliance of GSIS Act of 1997 are as follows:
