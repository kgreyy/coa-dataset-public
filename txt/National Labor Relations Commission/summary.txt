EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

A. Introduction 
 

The National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) was created under Article 213 

of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 442, known as the Labor Code of the Philippines (LCP) 

which took effect on November 1, 1974. It took over the functions of the Court of Industrial 

Relations (CIR) and the Ad Hoc NLRC established under PD No. 21. 

 

The NLRC and the Regional Arbitration Branches (RABs) were reorganized by 

Republic Act (RA) No. 6715 enacted on November 1, 1989. It is attached to the Department 

of Labor and Employment (DOLE) for program and policy coordination.  

 

The NLRC is mandated to promote and maintain industrial peace based on social 

justice by resolving labor and management disputes involving both local and overseas 

workers through compulsory arbitration and alternative modes of dispute resolution. 

Pursuant to Article 217 of the LCP, the Labor Arbiters shall have original and exclusive 

jurisdiction to hear and decide on the following cases involving all workers whether 

agricultural or non-agricultural: 

 

 Unfair Labor Practice case; 

 Termination disputes; 

 If accompanied with a claim for reinstatement, those cases that workers may file 
involving wages, rates of pay, hours of work and other terms and conditions of 

employment; 

 Claims for actual, moral, exemplary and other forms of damages arising from 
the employer-employee relationship; 

 Cases arising from any violation of Article 264 of the LCP, including questions 
involving the legality of strikes and lockouts; and 

 Except claims for Employees Compensation, Social Security, Medicare and 
Maternity Benefits, all other claims, arising from employer-employee relations, 

including those of persons in domestic or household services, involving an 

amount exceeding five thousand pesos (₱5,000.00) regardless of whether 

accompanied with a claim for reinstatement. 

 

The adjudicatory powers of the NLRC are being exercised by the 113 Offices of 

Labor Arbiters in the NLRC RABs and the Commission Proper (CP) that sit in eight 

Divisions. The CP is a tripartite in representation. Each of the eight Divisions has three 

members with the Presiding Commissioner representing the government sector and the 

remaining two members representing the workers’ and the employers’ sectors. The first six 

Divisions handle appealed cases from the National Capital Region (NCR), and other parts 

of Luzon; the Seventh Division handles appealed cases in the Visayas Region and the 

Eighth Division, for appealed cases in the Mindanao area. 

 

The Commission is composed of a Chairman, 20 Commissioners, 101 Commission 

Attorneys and 139 Labor Arbiters, of which 60 are in the NCR. It is presently headed by 



 

 

ii 

Chairman Gerardo C. Nograles, assisted by the Acting Executive Clerk of the Commission, 

Atty. Elenita F. Cruz, with the former having administrative supervision over the 

Commission, its regional branches and all its personnel, including the Executive Labor 

Arbiters and the Labor Arbiters.  

 

The Commission has 1,295 authorized plantilla positions, of which 1,096 are filled-

up as of yearend, leaving a balance of 199 unfilled positions. The NLRC Central Office 

(CO) and RAB Offices have 496 officers and 600 employees. There are 44 employees on 

Job Order basis and one casual employee. 

 

To carry out its mandate, the NLRC is authorized under Rule VI, Section 6 of the 

Rules of Procedures of the NLRC to collect cash and surety bond in an amount equivalent 

to the monetary award, exclusive of moral and exemplary damages and attorney’s fees. 

The cash bonds and garnished amounts are treated as Trust Receipts and are deposited in 

an Authorized Government Depository Bank (AGDB) as an exemption from the provision 

of Executive Order (EO) No. 338 implemented by the Commission on Audit (COA), 

Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and Department of Finance (DOF) Joint 

Circular No. 1-97 dated January 2, 1997, which requires the transfer to the National 

Treasury of cash balances of fiduciary funds deposited in the AGDB. This authority is 

contained in a letter dated May 5, 2004 of the DBM Secretary informing the NLRC 

Chairman of the approval of the President of the latter’s request for exemption.  

 

The NLRC is adopting a partially decentralized system of accounting. One set of 

books of accounts is maintained for CO including the First to Sixth Divisions and NCR 

Arbitration Branch (NCRAB). The Seventh and Eight Divisions, other 14 RABs (I to XIII 

and CAR) and 10 Sub-RABs (I, III to X and XII) maintain separate set of books of 

accounts.

(employer). The amount of Judgment Awards reached ₱1.314 billion, benefiting 6,650 

number of workers involved.  

 

 



 

 

iv 

 

The NLRC also implemented the Project Speedy and Efficient Delivery of Labor 

Justice (SpeED), which prescribes the periods of deciding labor cases brought to the RABs 

and Appellate Level under its compulsory arbitration services. For the RABs, the Process 

Cycle Time (PCT) is nine months, while for the appealed cases at the CP, the PCT is six 

months; the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) Policy (En Banc Resolution No. 13-07), which 

requires a minimum level of performance (quota system of 27 cases per month) and the 

aging of cases system (no more than 9-month old cases, FIFO Policy). Both the NLRC 

RABs and CP attained 85 percent or 23,907 disposed cases, out of 28,016 targeted cases 

to be disposed within the prescribed period/process cycle of nine months for the RAB and 

six months for the CP.  

 

 Moreover, the NLRC achieved and exceeded its target of 98 percent on the 

percentage of its decisions affirmed by a higher authority, one of which is the Court of 

Appeals. During CY 2020, 4,134 of its decided cases were appealed by the concerned 

parties to higher authorities. Of the said number of cases, 4,103 or 99 percent of its 

decisions were affirmed, an indication of the Commission’s Labor Arbiters’ diligence in 

their work performance. 

 

C. Financial Highlights 
 

 The NLRC had an Agency-Specific Budget of ₱1,227,783,000.00 (net of

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the 

financial statements of the NLRC for CY 2020. As stated in the Independent Auditor’s 

Report and discussed in detail in Part II of this Report, a total misstatement of 

₱12,413,537.95 was found in Cash and Cash Equivalents, Inventories, Property, Plant and 

Equipment, and Liabilities accounts of the NLRC-CO and its RABs due to accounting 

errors and omissions, thus the accuracy, completeness, classification, existence and rights 

and obligations of said accounts cannot be relied upon, thereby affecting the fair 

presentation of the financial statements. 

 

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

 The following are the significant observations and recommendations as discussed 

in Part II of this Report: 

 

1. A total misstatement of ₱12,413,537.95 was found in the audit of Cash and 
Cash Equivalents, Inventories, Property, Plant and Equipment, and Liabilities 

accounts of the NLRC-CO and RABs due to accounting errors and omissions 

which significantly affected the fair presentation of its financial statements 

(FSs) as at December 31, 2020. (Observation No. 1) 

 

We recommended that the Management: 

 

Misstatements in Cash and Cash Equivalents Accounts 

 

a. recognize all reconciling items in the BRSs that require 
correction/adjustment in the books to reflect the correct balance of 

the Cash in Bank and other affected accounts; 

 

b. fast-track/facilitate the verification of the long-standing 
overstatement in the Cash in Bank  (Fiduciary Award-LBP Trust 

account) in CO and NCRAB amounting to ₱13,562,529.63 and take 

up the necessary adjustments/corrections to reflect the correct 

balance of the said Cash in Bank account; 

 

c. make representation with the concerned bank to immediately correct 
the bank errors noted in the last BRSs; and 

 

d. prepare the necessary correcting entries to record the 
cancelled/unreleased commercial checks and undeposited collections 

to reflect the correct balance of the affected Cash and Cash 

Equivalents accounts. 

 

 

 



 

 

vii 

Misstatements in Inventories Accounts 

 

e. RAB VIII direct the Accounting Unit to effect the necessary 
adjustments in order to reflect the correct balance of the Inventories

services already delivered and accepted in the Accounts Payable 

account; and  

 

h. Seventh Division adjust the recorded liabilities without services 
rendered and recognize liabilities in the books of accounts only when 

goods are delivered and services are rendered. 

 

2. Variances between accounting records and supporting schedules/documents 
due to lack of reconciliation, existence of dormant account balances, non-

preparation/submission of supporting documents/schedules and 

unsubstantiated adjusting entries affected the reliability, accuracy and 

completeness of the reported balances in Cash and Cash Equivalents, 

Receivables, Inventories, Other Current Assets, PPEs and Liabilities accounts, 

with deficiencies in the aggregate amount of ₱2,791,269,215.06. (Observation 

No. 2) 

 

We recommended that the Management:  

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

 

a. direct the NCRAB Cashier to submit the “Missing OPs”. 
Henceforth, require him to submit RCDs duly reviewed and 

supported with copies of ORs and OPs to the Accounting Division 

to facilitate the recording of trust liabilities particular to each labor 

case; 

 

b. CO and NCRAB require the Accountant to investigate the 
discrepancy of ₱249,360.73 noted between the RCDs prepared by 

the respective Cashiers and the entries made in the CRJ and GL, 

and prepare the corresponding adjusting entries; 

 



 

 

viii 

c. CO and NCRAB, and RAB I require the Petty Cash Fund

₱742,273.58, respectively, for proper accounting thereof and fair 

presentation of the FSs of the Agency. For the dormant account, 

coordinate with the NLRC-CO Accounting Department for the 

proper management/accounting treatment thereof;

recorded cash advances and that of Mr. Sanota for possible write-

off, in accordance with the procedures prescribed in COA Circular 

No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. Prepare all the necessary

3. Of the total allotments received amounting to ₱1,720,154,227.00, 
₱1,719,565,475.06 or 99.97 percent was obligated, leaving the remaining 

balance of ₱588,751.94 or only 0.03 percent unutilized. However, deficiencies 

in the preparation and submission of budgetary reports and the supporting 

schedules were observed such as: (a) errors in reporting appropriations and 

allotments resulting in understatement of the total adjusted appropriations by 

₱37,843,815.00 and obligated amounts more than the appropriations and 

allotments received; (b) discrepancies between the amounts recorded in the 

Registries of Allotments, Obligations and Disbursements (RAODs) and 

Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and 

Balances (SAAODB); (c) non-compliance with the forms for RAODs 

prescribed in Volume II of the GAM for NGAs; and (d) non-submission of 

reports/records and other documents to support the amounts reported in the 

SAAODB. (Observation No. 3) 

 

We recommended that the Management cause the correction of errors 

noted in the appropriations and allotments reported in the SAAODB; 

regularly maintain and update RAODs to facilitate and efficiently 

monitor, account and report budget utilization at any given year; prepare 

registries using the prescribed format in Volume II of the GAM for NGAs; 

and submit the budget reports/records and other documents mentioned 

in par. 3.12, Part II of this Report for further audit. 

 

4. Only the output indicator for appealed cases affirmed before higher authorities 
with a target of 98 percent was achieved with accomplishment rate of 99 

percent, while targets for the three outcome/output performance indicators in 

the FY 2020 GAA for the implementation of the Agency’s Labor Arbitration 

Program were not attained due to the implementation of Alternative Work 

Arrangements (AWA) with only skeletal workforce which reduced office 

hours during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Only (a) 56 percent decrease, 

as against the target  of 61 percent increase in the cases resolved through 

conciliation-mediation was accomplished;  (b) 85 percent of original or 

appealed cases, as opposed to the 96 percent target, were decided within the 

nine-month process cycle time (PCT) for the  RABs and six-month PCT for 

the Commission Proper (CP); and (c) 43 percent of cases, which is below the 



 

 

xiii 

69 percent target, were resolved within three months from filing thereof. 

(Observation No. 8) 

 

Although majority of the targets on the outcome/output indicators for the 

implementation of the Labor Arbitration Program was not achieved in 

CY 2020, we still commended the Agency for exerting efforts to carry on 

with the implementation of its programs despite the challenges caused by 

the Pandemic in CY 2020. However, we recommended that the 

Management: 

 

a.  apply the target outcome/output indicator as a factor in reporting the 
accomplishment on the Double-Barreled Conciliation-Mediation 

Program based on the percentage increase in cases resolved which 

requires the comparison between the number of cases resolved 

through conciliation-mediation in the previous and current year; and 

 

b.  formulate or design strategies, in addition to those currently applied 
by the Agency, to improve its performance and reach the succeeding 

years’ targets taking into consideration the management of risks in 

times of adversities such as the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

 The foregoing audit observations and recommendations were communicated 

through Audit Observation Memoranda (AOMs) and discussed with Management officials 

in an Exit Conference conducted on June 9, 2021 and their comments were incorporated in 

this Report, where appropriate.
