PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

Financial Audit 
 

Accounting Errors/Omissions 

 

1. The Assets, Liabilities and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts of the 
Philippine Nuclear Research Institute (PNRI) were misstated by ₱191,716,468.74, 

₱126,453,308.02, and ₱13,111,339.70, respectively, representing 13.43 percent of its 

total assets, 16.57 percent of its Liabilities, and 1.97 percent of its Equity due to 

various accounting errors. The misstatements had significant impact on the balances 

of the affected accounts, thus, the accuracy of the balances, completeness and 

existence of the said accounts could not be relied upon. 

 

2. Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards 1 (IPSAS) and 
Section 15, Chapter II, Volume Iof the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) states that 

“the Financial Statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance 

and cash flows of an entity.  Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the 

effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 

recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSAS.” 

 

3. Moreover, Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 requires 
agencies to keep the accounts in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency 

and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control 

agencies of the government; and that the highest standard of honesty, objectivity and 

consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or 

misleading information. Each government agency shall record its financial transactions and 

operations conformably with IPSAS and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations. 

 

4. In our audit of the Agency’s accounts, we noted misstatements which were not 
adjusted as at year-end as summarized in Table 1:

5. COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, provides for the 
responsibility of the Agency in the monitoring and reconciliation of the advances, 

receivables and fund transfers accounts. It explicitly requires that: 

 

Section 5.1 All government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and 

analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these 

become due and demandable and that cash advances and fund transfers are 

liquidated within the prescribed period depending upon their nature and 

purpose;  

 

Section 7.1. The accountant shall conduct regular and periodic verification, 

analysis, and validation of the existence of the receivables, unliquidated 

cash advances, and fund transfers, and determine the concerned debtors, 

accountable officers and the source and implementing government entities 

concerned; 

 



38 

Section 7.2 reconcile the unliquidated fund transfers between the source and 

implementing government entities, prepare the adjusting entries for the 

reconciling items noted, and require liquidation of the balances. 

 

6. The General Ledger of the account Due from NGAs disclosed that transactions for 
CY 2020 pertain only to the advances forwarded to the DBM Procurement Service (PS-

DBM) for the purchase of common-use supplies, materials and equipment pursuant to 

Executive Order (EO) No. 40 s. 2010 and their corresponding deliveries. Confirmation of 

the transfers and deliveries from the PS-DBM’s Agency Summary of Payments and 

Deliveries against the Agency’s book of accounts disclosed a discrepancy amounting to 

₱2,149,744.39, the details of which are shown in Table 2:

8. The remaining variance of ₱828,595.04 cannot, however, be examined further as 
these pertains to prior years’ balances reported in the PS-DBM’s Agency Summary of 

Payments and Deliveries which date as far as CY 2018. These prior year balance represents 

the accumulated fund transfers intended for the purchase of common-supplies, materials 

and equipment, which are not delivered or partially delivered to the Agency and were 

unutilized for many years.  The accumulation of balances to  PS-DBM can be rectified 

following the PS-PhilGEPS Depot Operations Manual which provides for the procedures 

in the requisition of common use supplies, materials and equipment in PS-DBM as shown 

below: 

 

a. Agency Procurement Request made by any government agencies shall be 
reviewed first by the PS-DBM Depot Supply Officer (DSO) to check the 

availability of the Supplies.  

b. If found partially available, a Certificate of Balance for the unavailable supplies 
shall be prepared together with the Delivery Receipt and shall be forwarded to 

the Requesting Agency.  

c. If none of the stock is available, a Certificate of non-availability shall likewise 
be issued by the DSO.  

 

9. Pursuant to the procedures laid down by the PS-DBM, the Agency is informed of 
the availability of the item to be procured and the balance which remained undelivered or 

partially delivered. Thus, monitoring of these balances can be regularly undertaken to 

rectify the accumulation of balances. Moreover, the Agency should utilize the remaining 

balance in the PS-DBM for requisitioning supplies, materials and equipment instead of 

transferring additional funds.  

 

10. The lack of reconciliation of the advances and deliveries to reflect the accurate 
balances in the Agency’s records resulted in the accumulation of idle fund in the PS-DBM 

and misstatement in the Other Receivables, Office Supplies Inventory, Information and 

Communications Technology Equipment, and Travelling Expense accounts as shown 

below:

11. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Accountant to analyze the Due from NGAs account and reconcile with 
the PS-DBM records, then prepare the necessary adjusting/correcting 

entries; 

 

b. The Property Officer to regularly update the Accounting Unit of the 
deliveries from PS-DBM and furnish copies of the APR, Certificate of 

Balance, Delivery Receipts and Agency Summary of Payments and Deliveries 

to facilitate matching of payments against deliveries; and 

 

c. The Property Officer and Accountant to: 
 

i. make representations with the PS-DBM in order to use the remaining 
idle funds in purchasing current common use supplies, materials or 

equipment requirements while limiting the transfer of funds unless idle 

funds in the PS-DBM are exhausted; 

 

ii. coordinate with the PS-DBM and reconcile the prior year balance by 
matching the Agency Procurement Request (APR) with the paid checks 

and the Delivery Receipts/Sales Invoices appearing in the DBM-PS 

records as against the Property records and the Accounting general 

ledger; and 

 

iii. henceforth, reconcile periodically the advances forwarded and received 
by the PS-DBM vis-a-vis the deliveries received and undelivered for 

accurate reporting of balances. 

 

B. Misclassification of fund transfers to IAEA as Other Receivables instead of Due from 
Non-Governmental Organizations/People’s Organizations — ₱74,191,416.37 

 

12. Volume III of the GAM for NGAs provides the following definition of the accounts 
for proper classification of transactions: 

 
Account Title Other Receivables 
Description This account is used to recognize amount due from debtors and other agencies not falling any of 

the specific receivable account. This also includes receivables from individuals or entities intended 
for specific project or purpose not falling under any of the specific receivable account. Credit this 
account for payment/liquidation of receivables. 

 
Account Title Other Prepayments 



41 

Description This account is used to recognize amount of prepayments not falling under any of the specific 
prepayment accounts. Credit this account for the expended amount 

 
Account Title Advances to Contractors 
Description This account is used to recognize amount advances to contractors as authorized by law. Credit this 

account for recoupment of advances. 

 
Account Title Due from Non-Government Organizations/People’s Organizations 
Description This account is used to recognize amount of advances granted to Non-Government Organizations 

(NGOs)/ People’s Organizations (POs) for implementation of specific projects. Credit this account 
for liquidation of advances. 

 

13. As at December 31, 2020, the balance of Other Receivables account amounted to 
₱84,449,848.86, the details of which are shown in Table 5. The bulk of the balance consists 

of transfers made to the IAEA and to various foreign suppliers amounting to 

₱74,191,416.37 and ₱8,219,184.20, respectively. The transfers are advance payments in 

full for the goods and services needed by the Agency to ensure its fulfillment specifically 

radioactive supplies/materials/equipment/services. However, the classification of these 

transfers were erroneously recorded under Other Receivables contrary to the definition 

provided by the GAM. 

 
Table 5. Breakdown of Other Receivables as of 12.31.2020 

Particulars Amount Percentage 

Transfers made to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 74,191,416.37  87.9% 

Transfers to various Foreign suppliers 8,219,184.20 9.7% 

Inter-fund transfers 308,679.26 0.4% 

PS-DBM Procurement 1,017,369.60 1.2% 

Unreconciled Prior Year Balance 713,199.43 0.8% 

TOTAL  84,449,848.86  100% 

 

14. Other Receivables is basically a non-trade receivable which is not related to 
providing services or selling of goods as the primary business or function of an Agency but 

rather an amount owed to the Agency in terms of money from other activities. Hence, the 

fund transferred to the IAEA amounting to ₱74,191,416.37 could not be appropriately 

classified as Other Receivables, instead shall fall with the category of Due from Non-

Government Organizations/Peoples’ Organizations (NGOs/POs) that relates to transfers 

made to NGOs such as the IAEA for the implementation of specific projects. The IAEA 

did not owe money, nor had borrowed money or the Agency had performed services for 

the IAEA for collection of money in the future, and be recorded as receivable. Instead, the 

transfer of funds to the Organization in the procurement of goods/services is in furtherance 

of the project “Enhancing the Safety and Throughput of the Gamma Irradiation Facility.” 

 

15. On the other hand, the ₱8,219,184.20 that pertains to purchases from various 
foreign suppliers shall neither be classified as receivables, as the Agency does not expect 

collection of money from said suppliers nor are they debtors that owed money for services 

performed.  As observed from the definitions of the accounts in the GAM, the close related 

account for advance payments relates to procurement of infrastructures only under 

Advances to Contractors as authorized by law, but not for procurement of goods. The 

wording phrased as “as authorized by law” was given emphasis in the GAM because of the 

existing provision in PD 1445 and RA 9184 that prohibits advance payment and is allowed 



42 

only on strict circumstances. For transfers made in full payment to suppliers or contractors 

either in the purchase of goods, services, infrastructures, there was no exact account 

anywhere in the GAM that could adeptly accommodate for such kind of transaction 

primarily because if advance payments were prohibited, much more is the full payment. 

Nevertheless, the closest account where such kind of transaction can be properly lodged is 

the account Other Prepayments. 

 

16. Following the definition of Prepayments, a prepayment typically arises when the 
buyer cannot obtain credit from the seller, or when the buyer has ordered custom goods 

that the seller will not otherwise be able to sell if the buyer does not pay for the goods. 

Basically, all payments made by the buyer before the seller shipped the goods or provided 

services is considered a prepayment such as in the case of the ₱8,219,184.20 which were 

made to foreign suppliers in the procurement of radioactive supplies/equipment. 

 

17. As can be inferred from the above definitions and treatment for each account as 
provided by the GAM, advance payment in full to suppliers for the procurement of goods 

maybe properly classified as Other Prepayment, subject to query with the Commission on 

Audit, Government Accountancy Sector (COA-GAS), whether this account can be 

properly used for such kind of transaction. On the other hand, transfers made to non-

government organizations such as the IAEA for implementation of specific projects shall 

be recognized under Due from Non-Government Organizations account. 

 

18. Thus, the error in the recording of Other Receivables results in its overstatement 
amounting to ₱74,191,416.37 and understatement of the same amount in account Due from 

Non-Government Organizations/People’s Organizations. 

 

19. We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned 
personnel in the Accounting Section to: 

 

a. prepare the necessary adjusting/correcting entries in the Other Receivables 
and Due from Non-Government Organizations/People’s Organizations for the 

amount of ₱74,191,416.37 following Volume III of the GAM; and 

 

b. inquire from the COA- GAS in written form on the appropriate account to 
be used in the accounting for the purchases directly paid in full for foreign 

suppliers and adjust/correct the account, where appropriate. 

 
C. Undelivered goods or unperformed services recognized as Accounts Payable—

₱125,959,354.17 

 

20. Item 4.6 of COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2013-1 defines Accounts Payable as 
“obligation of government agencies, whether current year or prior years, for which services 

had been rendered, goods have been delivered or projects have been completed and 

accepted. Also, item 4.7 thereof provides that an obligation incurred by government 

agencies for which items have not yet been delivered and services not yet rendered is called 

a commitment or “Obligations Not Yet Due and Demandable.” 



43 

 

21. Section 2(a), Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that Accounts 
Payable refers to valid and legal obligations of National Government Agencies/ Operating 

Units (NGAs/OUs), for which, goods/services/projects have been 

delivered/rendered/completed and accepted, regardless of the year when these obligations 

were incurred. 

 

22. Essentially, the amounts charged to the Accounts Payable (AP) should pertain to 
transactions/purchases/procurement for which goods have been delivered and/or services 

were performed and accepted as at year-end. The journal entry made at year-end, JEV No. 

2294028 dated December 31, 2020, which is set up in recognition of the outstanding 

liabilities of the Agency in CY 2020 amounted to ₱130,172,265.15, recording for various 

accounts while crediting to Accounts Payable.  

 

23. The recorded AP of ₱130,172,265.15 at year-end composed of Not Yet Due and 
Demandable Obligations (NYDDO) in the amount of ₱125,959,354.17, while the balance 

of ₱4,212,910.98 pertains to Due and Demandable Obligations as reported in the Financial 

Accountability Reports No. 3 (FAR No.3) Aging of Unpaid Obligations. 

 

24. Pending acceptance of the services or actual receipt of the goods, it is proper that 
these purchases/procurements are reflected in the NYDDO portion of the FAR No.3 as 

mandated by the Department of Budget and Management but it is incorrect for it to be 

recorded as Accounts Payable. Although these are considered as obligations/commitment 

as reported in the FAR No. 3, it has not yet ripened to be charged to the account AP, unless 

there is performance undertaken by the contracted parties and such services or goods were 

received and duly accepted. Thus, it is incorrect for the amount of ₱125,959,354.17 which 

is identified in the FAR No. 3 as NYDDO to be recorded as Accounts Payable in the books 

of accounts. 

 

25.  Further, the Obligation Requests indicated in the FAR No. 3 for obligations 
reported as NYDDO were dated close to December 31, 2020, thus, supporting the notion 

that indeed there has been no delivery of goods or rendering of services has yet taken place. 

Hence, out of the ₱142,381,354.17 recorded balance of AP at year-end, 88% or 

₱125,959,354.17 of which are merely commitments of the Agency reported as NYDDO. 

 

26. The recognition, therefore, of goods undelivered and services not yet performed by 
contractors/suppliers in the book of accounts as Accounts Payable overstates the Accounts 

Payable in the amount of ₱125,959,354.17 and other several asset accounts (Construction 

in Progress - Buildings and Other Structures (CIP)- ₱65,651,152.20, Information and 

Communication Technology Equipment (ICT)- ₱227,980.00, Office Equipment (OE)- 

₱22,750.00, and Technical and Scientific Equipment (TSE)- ₱46,996,083.27) totaling 

₱112,897,965.47 while understating the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit account by 

₱13,061,388.70, as shown below:

27. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 
 

a. effect the necessary adjusting entries to correct the balance of Accounts 
Payable, Construction in Progress - Buildings and Other Structures, 

Information and Communication Technology Equipment, Office Equipment, 

and Technical and Scientific Equipment and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit; 

 

b. reconcile the balances between the recorded Accounts Payable in the books 
of accounts and the FAR No. 3, if applicable; and  

 

c. henceforth, record liability only at the time goods are received and services 
are rendered and contractor billings are accepted pursuant to Section 2(a), 

Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs and Item 4.6 of COA-DBM Joint 

Circular No. 2013-1.

D. Overstatement of Other Payables and understatement of Trust Liabilities due to error 
in recording proceeds from bid documents and mailing fess – ₱493,953.85 

 

28. DBM Circular No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005 (as amended by BC No. 2007-
3 dated November 29, 2007), provides the guidelines on the grant of honoraria to 

government personnel involved in government procurement. Embodied therein is Section 

6.2 which provides that, “all agencies are authorized to treat the collections from the 

sources identified in item 6.1 hereof as trust receipts to be used exclusively for the payment 

of honoraria and overtime pay herein authorized.  Agencies may utilize up to one hundred 

percent (100%) of the said collections for the payment of honoraria and overtime pay 

subject to the guidelines in item 5.0 of this Circular.  Any excess in the amount collected 

shall be remitted by NGAs to the Bureau of the Treasury.  xxx….” 

 

29. The Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) for NGAs as described in Volume III of the 
GAM for NGAs provides the following information: 

 
Account Title   :  Trust Liabilities 

Description     :    This account is used to recognize the receipt of amount held in trust for specific 

purpose. Debit this account for payment or settlement of the liability. 

 

30. As at December 31, 2020, the balance of account Other Payables (OP) Fund 184-
R as reported in the General Ledger amounted to ₱493,953.85 for which transactions for 

the year affecting the account is shown in Table 7:

           Adjustments 329,050.09 

Ending Balance 493,953.85 

 

31. The transactions affecting Other Payables Fund 184-R, specifically credits to the 
account disclosed that the account is credited whenever mailing fees and proceeds from 

sale of bid documents are collected. The mailing fees are considered “payment for courier 

services” paid by the PNRI clients to be utilized in sending out the result of the radiation 

dose report to the clients. On the other hand, proceeds from sale of bid documents are to 

be utilized in the payment of honoraria and other procurement related expenses. 

 

32. By nature of the collections, these are trust receipts held by the Agency for specific 
purpose and should be properly credited to the Trust Liabilities account (20401010) instead 

of the Other Payables account. The misclassification of these collections overstates the 



46 

Other Payables account and understates the Trust Liabilities account in the amount of 

₱493,953.85.  

 

33. Further, the appropriate recording of the accounts is necessary to show the actual 
payables that should be paid when it is due and those that are just merely held in trust for 

specific purposes such as the trust receipt collections. 

 

34. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 
 

a. prepare necessary adjusting/correcting entries in the amount of ₱493,953.85 
to reflect the correct balances of the Other Payables and Trust Liabilities; and 

 

b. henceforth, record the collection of the sale of bid documents and mailing 
fees in the appropriate account in accordance with Item 6.2 of Budget 

Circular No. 2004-5A dated October 07, 2005, and the Revised Chart of 

Accounts for National Government Agencies as described in Volume III of 

the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government 

Agencies (NGAs). 

 

35. In summary, due to the significant impact on the financial statements of the total  
misstatements of various accounts of the PNRI under the Assets, Liabilities and Net Asset 

accounts by ₱191,716,468.74, ₱126,453,308.02, and ₱13,111,339.70, respectively,  

representing 13.43 percent of its total assets, 16.57 percent of its Liabilities, and 1.97 

percent of its Equity,  we rendered a Qualified Opinion on the Financial Statements of the 

PNRI as at year-end. 

 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

36. Several accounting deficiencies were also noted totaling ₱258,681,429.89, thereby, 
affecting the accuracy, reliability and accountability of the pertinent FSs accounts as at 

year-end, details are shown in Table 8:

A. Dormant unliquidated fund transfers aging more than 6 to 28 years — ₱974,536.87 
 

37. COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 outlined the Guidelines and 
Procedures on the Write-off of Dormant Receivable Accounts, Unliquidated Cash 

Advances, and Fund Transfers of National Government Agencies (NGAs) for the purpose 

of reconciling and cleaning the books of accounts of NGAs of dormant receivable accounts, 

unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers for fair presentation of accounts in the FSs. 

The following are provisions attendant to the case of the Agency’s unliquidated fund 

transfers: 

 

38. Item 5.6 of the COA Circular No. 2016-005 define Dormant Unliquidated Fund 
Transfers as advances granted by the source entity to implementing entity for the 

implementation of programs/projects which remained non-moving for ten (10) years or 

more and where settlement could no longer be ascertained. 

 

39. The Due from NGAs account, as shown in Table 9, disclosed the existence of non-
moving unliquidated fund transfers from various government agencies. The balances 

pertain to transfers made by the Agency  to several agencies in undertaking special projects 

for the period July 1992 to April 2014. It shall be noted that this dormancy has been the 

subject of audit observations for the past two years for which no action was yet taken by 

Management. Details of which is shown below:

40. Following the above-cited COA Circular, the non-moving balances aging 20 years 
to 28 years amounting to ₱445,553.87 qualifies as dormant unliquidated fund for which a 

request for authority to write-off shall be undertaken considering the condition that there 

is absence of records to fully support/validate the claim.  

 

41. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. request for authority to write off the balance of ₱445,553.87 after 
undertaking the prescribed guidelines under COA Circular No. 2016-005; 

 

b. send confirmation letters to the identified government implementing agencies 
(IAs) including request for Certification by the Chief Accountants and 

approved by the Heads of the IAs whether the balance of ₱445,553.87 still 

exists in the IAs’ books of accounts; 

 

c. prepare certifications and reasons why the books of accounts/records, 
financial statements/schedules and supporting vouchers/documents cannot 

be located or in case there is loss of documents, the circumstances of the loss 

should be stated in support for the request for the authority to write-off; and 

 

d. require the Accountant to: 
 

i. prepare the aging of dormant unliquidated fund transfers and provide 
for the condition of the accounts to support the request for authority to 

write off following Section 7.4 of COA Circular No. 2016-005; 

 

ii. review, analyze and verify the non-moving fund transfer of ₱528,983.00 
and effect the necessary correcting/adjusting entries to arrive at the 

accurate balances; and 

 



49 

iii. send confirmation and/or demand letters on the balance of ₱528,983.00 
to the identified government agencies. 

 

B. Unaccounted inventories due to non-conduct of physical inventory-taking, non-
preparation of duly reconciled RPCI and absence of Subsidiary Ledger and Stock 

Cards — ₱5,060,533.99 

 

42. COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 5, 1997, defines dormant accounts as 
individual or group of accounts which balances remained non-moving for more than five 

years.  It provides that when the accounts in the trial balance of a fund or funds are non-

moving for five consecutive years the Chief Accountant of other Officials concerned shall:  

 

a. initiate/cause the review, analysis and reconciliation of the account together 
with the other related accounts in the trial balance; 

 

b. therewith, determine proper disposition of reconciled and validated accounts 
such as conduct of physical count of inventories and fixed assets, and 

reconciliation of the same with those recorded in the books of accounts; and 

 

c.  if analysis/review of the accounts, funds is not possible due to the absence of 
records and documents, the agency head concerned should request for write-off 

and/or adjustment of account balances from the COA, supported by (i) list of 

available records and extent of validation made on the accounts, and (ii) 

Certification and reasons why the books of accounts/records, financial 

statements/schedules and supporting vouchers/documents cannot be located. 

 

43. Section 13, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM states that Physical count/inventory, 
which is required semi-annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity 

of proper custodianship. 

 

44. Appendix 66, Volume II of the GAM refers to the Report on the Physical Count of 
Inventories (RPCI) as a form used to report the physical count of inventory items by type 

such as Office Supplies Inventory; Accountable Forms Inventory Medical, Dental and 

Laboratory Supplies Inventory; Food Supplies Inventory, etc. which are owned by the 

agency/entity. It shall be prepared semi-annually by the Inventory Committee and by fund 

cluster. Further, the report shall be reconciled with the SLCs and SCs maintained by the 

Accounting Division/Unit, and Property and/or Supply Division/Unit, respectively. Any 

discrepancy shall be verified and/or adjusted accordingly. The report shall be submitted to 

the COA Auditor concerned not later than July 31 and January 31 of each year for the first 

and second semesters, respectively. 

 

45. The General Ledger balances of the inventory accounts for CY 2020, relating to its 
purchases and issuances, disclosed that all recorded purchases in CY 2020 were all issued 

on the same year. Details are shown in Table 10.

47. The balance of ₱5,060,533.99 existed in the books since CY 2012, yet ceased to 
exist in the property records. In other words, said inventories may either have been 

distributed, or have expired, thus, no longer being kept in the Property records. This finding 

is a reiteration of the Prior Year’s observation as disclosed in the CY 2019 AAR which 

narrated that there was absence of Supplies Ledger Card (SLs) maintained for the above-

mentioned accounts.  There was also lack of property records to support the inventories 

because the Medical Officer responsible for the medical supplies and drugs and medicines 

already retired, while the laboratory supplies were directly issued to the individual project 

leaders/end-users. Effectively, the accountability for the inventories as well as the 

responsibility for the keeping of the records were not maintained. On the other hand, the 

General Services Section has no existing records of the Other Supplies and Materials. 

 

48. Accordingly, there were no available records such as SLs and Stock Cards (SCs) to 
support the reconciliation and confirmation of the actual status of the condition of the 

recorded purchases. Moreover, it was also noted that there was no submission of Report on 

Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) on the Drugs and Medicines, Medical, Dental and 

Laboratory Supplies, and Other Supplies and Materials to the Audit Team because there 

has been no physical inventory-taking undertaken. Semi-annually, the RPCI shall be 

reconciled with the SLCs and SCs. Any discrepancy noted shall be immediately verified 

and adjusted either in the SLCs or SCs or both. The lack therefore of such essential reports 



51 

and records hinders reconciliation of balances which resulted in the unaccounted balances 

that remained in the book of accounts unadjusted for a longer period. 

 

49. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. create an Inventory Committee specifically designated to conduct the 
inventory-taking of the noted unaccounted inventories of ₱5,060,533.99 to 

establish its actual condition and existence. Therewith, reconcile with the 

records of the Property and Accounting Sections for proper disposition of the 

accounts, pursuant to Item III (A) and (B), COA Circular No. 97-001;  

 

b. designate Property Custodian for each account of inventory for other 
supplies and materials, drugs and medicines, medical and dental and 

laboratory supplies and furnish copy of the list to the Audit Team;  

 

c. require the Accountant to: 
 

i. review, analyze and reconcile with the Property records and the report 
of the Inventory Committee to be created specifically for the 

unaccounted non-moving balance of ₱5,060,533.99 and effect the 

necessary adjusting entries (if applicable); 

 

ii. if analysis/review of the accounts is not possible due to the absence of 
records and documents, report to the agency head concerned for 

further request for write-off and/or adjustment of account balances 

from the COA, supported by (i) list of available records and extent of 

validation made on the accounts such as the inventory-taking 

undertaken proving for the actual condition of the inventories (if 

existing still or not), and (ii) Certification and reasons why the books of 

accounts/records, financial statements/schedules and supporting 

vouchers/ documents could not be located following the Item III (A) and 

(B), COA Circular No. 97-001; 

 

iii. regularly maintain and update SLC for the receipt and issuances of 
delivered and accepted goods/supplies; and 

 

iv. regularly reconcile balances in the books of accounts and 
supply/property records, for the accuracy of the presented balance. The 

balance in quantity per Stock Cards (SC) should always reconcile with 

the Supplies Ledger Card (SLCs) and all discrepancies must be 

investigated and cleared immediately; 

 

 

 

 

 



52 

d. require the Property Custodian (GSS)/Medical Officer/Project Leaders to: 
 

i. regularly maintain and update the Stock Cards for the receipt and 
issuances of delivered and accepted drugs and medicines and medical, 

dental and laboratory supplies as well as other supplies and materials; 
 

ii. coordinate and reconcile with the Accounting Department the 
unaccounted inventories of ₱5,060,533.99; and 
 

iii. regularly reconcile its SCs with the Accounting Department’s SLCs to 
establish accuracy, existence and completeness of the balances; and 

 

e. enjoin the Inventory Committee to: 
 

i. conduct the inventory-taking and investigate the unaccounted 
inventories of ₱5,060,533.99; 
 

ii. henceforth, regularly undertake the physical inventory-taking of all 
inventories including Drugs and Medicines, Medical, Dental and 

Laboratory, and Other Supplies and Materials and submit to the Audit 

Team the duly reconciled RPCI in strict compliance with Section 13, 

Chapter 8, Volume I and Appendix 66, Volume II of the GAM; and 
 

iii. prepare and submit promptly to the Audit Team the reconciled RPCI 
semi-annually not later than July 31 and January 31 of each year. 

 

50. Management explained that the non-moving/outstanding balance amounting to 
₱5,060,533.99 were dormant due to the absence of proper documents such as the 

Requisition Issue Slip (RIS) and Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) which are the basis of the 

Accounting Section (AS) to update/adjust the accounting ledger.   In its inquiry with the 

PPS, these inventories were already distributed and issued to the end-users several years 

ago, but proper documentation were not submitted for update and adjustment of inventory 

balance.  

 

C. Unreconciled difference of PPE balance between the Accounting and Property — 
₱226,022,307.80; inclusion of unserviceable PPEs in both the Accounting and 

Property records — ₱20,862,880.64; and non-inclusion of completed building 

structure in the Property records — ₱5,031,944.17 

 

51. Chapter 10 (Property Plant and Equipment), Volume I of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) provides for several guidelines in the accounting, custody and 

control of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) as follows: 

 

 On the physical count of PPEs 
 

 Sec 38. Physical Count of PPE. The entity shall have a periodic physical 
count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on 

the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 



53 

73) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor 

concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found 

at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported 

to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording.” 

 

 Sec. 42. Accounting and Property Records to be maintained for PPE. The 
Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE 

including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept 

to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful 

life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the 

asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall 

likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and 

disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC 

maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled 

with other property records like PAR. 

 

 Sec. 42 (g). Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment 
(Appendix 73) – shall be used to report the physical count and condition of 

PPE by type as at a given date, including those which are unrecorded and 

those which could not be accounted for. It shows the balance of PPE per 

property cards and per count and the shortage/overage, if any. It shall be 

rendered by the Inventory Committee, on its yearly physical count of 

properties owned by the entity. 

 

 On the unserviceable PPEs 
 

 Section 39 . Derecognition. The cost of the PPE together with the related 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss shall be 

removed from the accounts. The carrying amount of an item of PPE shall 

be derecognized on disposal or when no future economic benefits or service 

potential is expected from its use or disposal. 

 

 Section 40(d). Idle, Unserviceable and Fully Depreciated PPE. All 
unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection 

Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP). PPE reported in the IIRUP shall 

be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant 

and Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation). 

 

 On completed projects initially recorded as Construction in Progress 
 

 Section 8 (g). Construction of PPE. “During the construction period, all 
expenses incurred in relation to the construction of the PPE shall be taken 

up in the books as Construction in Progress (CIP) with the appropriate asset 

classification. As soon as the construction is completed, the “Construction 

in Progress” account shall be reclassified to the proper asset account. 



54 

Likewise, all expenses such as interests, license fees, etc., during the 

construction period shall be capitalized.” 

 

 Construction in Progress – Infrastructure Assets account is used to 
recognize the accumulated cost or other appropriate value of infrastructure 

assets which are still in the process of construction or acquisition. In 

addition, the account is credited for reclassification to the appropriate 

Infrastructure Asset account upon completion of the project. 

 

52. Due to the perennial issue of the discrepancy in the PPE account balances that 
greatly affects the exception in the fairness of Financial Statement, COA Circular No. 

2020-006 dated January 31, 2020, “Guidelines and procedures in the Conduct of Physical 

Count of property, Plant and Equipment (PPE), Recognition of PPE Items Found at Station, 

and Disposition for Non-existing/Missing PPE Items. For the One-Time Cleansing of PPE 

Account Balances of Government Agencies” was issued. 

 

53. Further, the DBM prescribed for all National Government Agencies the adherence 
to the Manual on Disposal of Government Property which provides that “Disposal 

proceedings should be immediately initiated to avoid further deterioration of the property 

and consequent depreciation in its value. A systematic and timely disposal will yield 

benefits in terms of , among others, a higher appraisal value and by enabling storage areas 

available for other purposes.” Included among others in the said Manual are the procedures 

to be undertaken, the scope of the disposable properties, and committee created in the 

disposal of government properties. 

 

i. Reporting difference between the Accounting and Property records —
₱226,022,307.80 

 

54. As at 31 December 2020, the accounting books reported the balance of the Property, 
Plant and Equipment (PPE) amounting to ₱1,029,721,724.24 as an aggregate of various 

PPEs such as Buildings and Other Structures, Machinery and Equipment, Motor Vehicles, 

Furniture and Fixtures, Books and Other Property, Plant and Equipment and excluding 

the Construction in Progress account. The submitted Report on the Physical Count of 

Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) of the Property Section against the recorded PPE 

in the books of accounts disclosed a variance of ₱221,960,205.60 as shown in Table 12. 

The reported discrepancy is a reiteration of prior years’ observations.

55. In the submitted RPCPPE, the column was unfilled for the actual number of PPE 
counted due to non-conduct of physical inventory-taking. According to the Procurement 

and Property Section (PPS), the absence of physical inventory-taking was attributed to the 

limitations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a consequence, reconciliation was not 

undertaken for CY 2020 for the balances reported in the books and in the property records, 

contrary to the pertinent provisions of Chapter 10 Volume I of the GAM as mentioned. 

Further, Management commented that part of the unreconciled balance relates to 

missing/non-existing and the amount of which could not be determined yet. 

 

56. It is emphasized that the physical inventory-taking is important in order to: (a) 
assess the integrity of property custodianship of accountable employees; (b) note 

exceptions during physical count such as PPEs not found in the station, missing/inexistent, 

and found in the station but not recorded in the Property Card/ Property Ledger Card or 

any record maintained by the Property; and (c) communicate such noted exceptions to the 

Accounting and Property for reconciliation and recording purposes. Essentially, the 

purpose is to establish accountability, existence and accuracy of the initially recorded 

balances. 

 

ii. Existence of unserviceable PPEs in the book of accounts and Property records 
—₱20,862,880.64 

 

57. Included in the submitted RPCPPE are the PPEs amounting to ₱20,862,880.64, 
which were marked as unserviceable and found to exist in the report since CY 2018. This 

observation is a reiteration of prior years’ audit observations included in the Annual Audit 

Reports, the details of which are in Table 13.

58. A PPE is said to be unserviceable if it is no longer capable of providing the entity 
with future economic benefits or service potential. Upon determination of the condition of 



56 

PPEs after the physical inventory-taking, it shall be reported in the Inventory and 

Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) and be dropped from the books. As 

disclosed in the RPCPPE, its condition warrants assessment of its value in consideration 

of its appropriate disposal pursuant to Section 79 of PD 1445. Accordingly, all 

unserviceable PPEs must be disposed of immediately to at least save the Agency of any 

value that maybe considered through sale. The delay in its disposal exposes the PPE to 

further deterioration and loss of economic value which may deprive the government of the 

revenue it may generate if found to still be marketable. 

 

iii. Unrecorded completed building structures in the Inventory Report — 
₱5,031,944.17   

 

59. The submitted Quarterly Report on the Government Projects, Programs and 
Activities vis-a-vis Reports of Checks Issued and Disbursement Vouchers disclosed the 

completed project amounting to ₱5,031,944.17 which was also recorded under the Building 

account as shown below:

TOTAL          5,031,944.17   

 

60. Initially, the amount was recorded under Construction in Progress and eventually 
reclassified to the infrastructure asset account upon completion. Although the project was 

properly recorded in the book of accounts, the Inventory Report failed to recognize such. 

Thus, necessitates updating for accuracy of the reflected balances. 

 

61. Moreover, in view of the existence of the discrepancy between the books and 
property records for several years and the attendant circumstances of unserviceable and 

missing PPEs, the procedure herein mandated by COA Circular No. 2020-006 is warranted.  

The newly issued circular requires for the designation of a new inventory committee 

dedicated solely for one-time cleansing of PPE account balances to be undertaken in three 

months or less which is applicable in this case. 

 

62. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. create an Inventory Committee composed of adequate members designated 
specifically to conduct the physical count of all its PPE for the one-time 

cleansing of PPE balances for the period of three month or less and observe 

the step-by-step procedure pursuant to COA Circular No. 2020-006;  

 

b. regularly undertake the annual physical count of all PPEs within the custody 
of the Agency and properly fill up the “Quantity per Physical Count” for 

regular submission to the Audit Team following Section 38, Chapter 10, 

Volume I of the GAM; 



57 

 

c. instruct the Property and Accounting Sections to periodically reconcile for 
check and balance, together with the PPE Inventory Committee, for the 

noted exceptions, pursuant to Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM; 

and 

 

d. instruct the Property Section to: 
 

i. prepare the IIRUP as the basis for the Accounting to account in the 
books the unserviceable properties amounting to ₱20,862,880.64 

pursuant to Section 79 of PD 1445 and Section  40(d), Chapter 10, 

Volume I  and Appendix 74, Volume II of the GAM; 

 

ii. therewith, promptly dispose appropriately the unserviceable PPEs 
following NBC No. 425 dated January 28, 1992; and 

 

iii. recognize in the property records specifically the Property Card the 
completed infrastructure building pursuant to Section 20, Chapter 10 

Volume I of the GAM. 
 

63. Management informed the Audit Team that the Property and Procurement Section 
(PPS) prepared the IIRUP which was submitted to the Accounting Section (AS) for 

disposal of unserviceable properties as at December 31, 2019 for eventual reconciliation 

of balances. However, the disposal of unserviceable properties to facilitate also the 

reconciliation was not possible because the AS records of PPE only provides detailed 

breakdown for period covering year 2008 up to the present, thus hinder the reconciliation 

and recognition of unserviceable properties in the PPS records amounting to 

₱20,862,880.64 which was accumulated even prior to year 2008. Nevertheless, they noted 

that with the current issuance of COA Circular No. 2020-006, such problem will be 

addressed and therefore, they will adhere to the procedures laid down therein for the One-

Time Cleansing of the PPE Accounts. 

 

D. Outstanding payables for more than four (4) years — ₱729,226.42  
 

64. Section 114, Chapter 2 - “Accounts and Accounting”, of PD 1445 states that  “the 
government accounting system shall be on a double entry basis with a general ledger in 

which all financial transactions are recorded and a Subsidiary records which shall be kept 

where necessary.” 

 

65. Executive Order (EO) No. 87 dated August 13, 2019 provides for the following: 
 

Section 1. Reversion of Documented Accounts Payable. All documented 

accounts payable for fiscal year 2016 and years prior thereto shall be 

reverted to Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund,  the 

Cumulative Result of Operations of the National Government. Henceforth, 

all documented accounts payable which remain outstanding for at least two 



58 

years, for which no actual administrative or judicial claim has been files, 

shall be subject to automatic reversion. 

 

Section 2. Treatment of Undocumented Accounts Payable. All accounts 

payable which are undocumented or not covered by perfected contracts on 

record, regardless of the year in which they were incurred shall 

automatically be reverted. The recording of undocumented accounts 

payable in the books of accounts of agencies shall be strictly prohibited. 

 

66. As at December 31, 2020, the account Other Payables (OPs) in the General Ledger 
(GL) has the balance of ₱5,135,311.21. The account per funding presented the following 

condition:

Total Other Payables         5,135,311.21 729,226.42  

 

67. As shown in Table 15, the balance of Other Payables funded under 171 and 184-
MDS in the total of ₱729,226.42 have been dormant for more than four (4) years as 

validated from the GL of the account per fund and the Financial Statements per fund. The 

Accounting Section disclosed that the breakdown of the account in order to identify to 

whom the payables are due is not available. In other words, no subsidiary ledgers (SL) had 

been kept or maintained for each debtor/supplier/vendor specifically for the funds 

mentioned, contrary to Sections 114 of PD 1445. 

 

68. The absence of the SL to support the liabilities contained in Fund 171 and 184 MDS 
hinders the prompt identification of the creditors in the immediate settlement of the account 

and confirmation of the balances to verify if there exist a valid claim to the Agency. 

Effectively, this result to the balances being outstanding for more than four (4) years which 

is contrary to Section 114, Chapter 2 of PD 1445 and the recently issued Executive Order 

No. 87 from the President. 

 

69. Executive Order No. 87 provides that documented APs which remained outstanding 
for at least two years shall be reverted to Cumulative Results of Operations or Accumulated 

Surplus/Deficit, after the lapse of two years provided no actual claim, administrative or 

judicial is filed, or in the case of obligations which has no perfected contracts on record, to 

be reverted immediately. In this regard, the identified balance amounting to ₱729,226.42, 

which aged for more than four (4) years, requires review and analysis to establish actual 

claims thereto. Should there be no actual claims, then reversion must be undertaken 

immediately. 

 



59 

70. The continuous keeping of the accounts in the books for more than two years 
without proper identification of the details of the accounts and absence of documents to 

supports the non-moving balances in the Funds 171 and 184-MDS, render the 

establishment of actual liability of the Agency and affects fair presentation of the financial 

statement as to the existence and accuracy of the balances reported.  

 

71. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 
  

a. regularly keep and maintain Subsidiary Ledgers for each creditor/ 
supplier/vendor pursuant to Section 114 of PD 1445 vis-a-vis following the 

format prescribed in Appendix 6, Volume II of the GAM;  

 

b. undertake review and analysis and determine the existence of valid claims 
against the Agency reflecting in the account Other Payables under Funds 171 

and 184-MDS; 

 

c. send confirmations of the outstanding payables after identification of the 
creditors/suppliers/vendors; and 

 

d. revert to Accumulated Surplus/Deficit the amount of Other Payables 
determined to be outstanding for more than two (2) years and without valid 

claims, as provided under the Executive Order No. 87 and PD 1445 . 

 

72. Management explained that the balances reflecting the Other Payable (OP) account 
under Fund Cluster 171 and MDS 184 are from old accounts prior to the segregation of 

accounts per fund cluster in year 2015 which were then dormant to date and cannot be 

ascertained as to its validity. Since the balances in Fund 171 and 184 MDS cannot be 

substantiated, no confirmation of payables were done even during previous years. Thus, 

Management considered the reversion of the account wherein   Journal Entry Vouchers 

will be prepared in consideration of the circumstances, following Executive Order No. 87 

and PD 1445. 

 

Program Budget Utilization 

 

Delayed implementation of the project and loss of opportunity for the government to 

bargain due to the deficiency to enter into MOA/U/SBAA 

 

73. The failure to enter into Memorandum of Agreement between the Agency and 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the procurement of various 

supplies/materials/equipment amounting to ₱74,191,416.37 resulted in the delayed 

implementation of the project “Enhancing the Safety and Throughput of the Gamma 

Irradiation Facility” and loss of opportunity for the government to bargain and 

enforce the undertaking of the procurement in an effective and timely manner. 

 

74. Section 2 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that “all resources of the 
government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations 



60 

and safeguarded against loss or wastage resulting from illegal or improper disposition, with 

a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. 

The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with 

the chief or head of the government agency concerned.”  
 

75. Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Policy, Opinion No. 2015-10-30 
address the concern on whether United Nations Development Program (UNDP) could 

receive government funds without going through the process required under the 

Procurement Law. The GPPB clarified that the exception to the general rule of RA 9184 

shall apply to all the procurement of infrastructure projects, goods, and consulting services 

is the faithful compliance of the Philippines to international obligations under the time-

honored principle of international law, pacta sunt servanda. In detail, the GPPB in 

recognition of the Standard Basic Assistance Agreement (SBAA) entered into force on 

December 12,1977 by the Philippines and the United Nations Development Programme, 

procurement by UNDP utilizing funds received from the Philippine Government pursuant 

to the Standard Basic Assistance Agreement (SBAA) is not governed by RA 9184 and its 

IRR, but by the UNDP Financial Regulations and Rules, subject to limitations contained 

in the Project Documents that may be concluded by the parties, such as but not limited to: 

(1) the Procuring Entity lacks capacity to undertake the specific procurement project; (2) 

UNDP is capable of delivering the procurement requirements of the Procuring Entity in an 

efficient and timely manner, and (3) the request for assistance involves highly technical or 

highly complex procurement projects.  
 

76. In CY 2016, the Philippine Government through the PNRI availed for the Technical 
Cooperation Program (TCP) offered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 

in its Member States. The IAEA is an autonomous international organization within the 

United Nations System. TCP is the IAEA’s primary mechanism for transferring nuclear 

technology to Member States, helping them to address key development priorities in areas 

such as health and nutrition, food and agriculture, water and the environment, industrial 

applications, and nuclear knowledge development and management. The programme also 

helps Member States to identify and meet future energy needs, and assists in improving 

radiation safety and nuclear security worldwide, including through the provision of 

legislative assistance. It provides this support through capacity building, knowledge-

sharing, partnership-building, support for networking, and procurement. Basically, the 

fund for TCPs shall be from the Technical Cooperation Fund, extra budgetary 

contributions, government cost-sharing (funding where the donor is the recipient) and in-

kind contributions to IAEA.  
 

77.  The TCP between the IAEA and the Philippines was entitled “Enhancing the 
Safety and Throughput of the Gamma Irradiation facility through Full Automation” and 

with an initial budget of €884,722.01 sourced from the following contributions:

78. Additionally, in CY 2017 and CY 2018, the amount of €326,422.04 and 
€319,318.95, respectively, was again transferred to IAEA, thus totaling the contribution of 

the Philippines to €1,243,721.83 or ₱74,191,416.37 as at December 31, 2020, as shown in

79. As at December 31, 2020, the balance of ₱74,191,416.37 remained in the books 
and recorded under Other Receivables. The balance is the Philippine’s government share 

in the upgrading of the Agency’s gamma facility through full automation such as the 

procurement of radioactive material/supplies/equipment and facility with the end goal of 

replenishing approximately 200 kCi Cobalt-60 Source of the Gamma Irradiation facility as 

well as the purchasing of new self-shielded gamma irradiator to replace the existing 

Gammacell 220. 

 

80. The transfers made in CY 2016 is the subject of Audit Observation Memorandum 
(AOM) No. 2017-001 (2016) dated January 12, 2017 which noted the incomplete 

documentation of the transfers such as the non-submission of contract/MOA/MOU. In 

compliance with the said observation, the Agency furnished the former Audit Team of the 



62 

correspondences between the IAEA and PNRI, which was then found substantial despite 

absence of MOA/MOU. Further, the Agency also commented that at that time, the project 

should have been delivered and installed approximately in 3rd or 4th Quarter of 2017. 

 

81. In CY 2017, the transfers made in CY 2016 and CY 2017 was again the subject of 
AOM No. 2018-006-(2017) dated February 27, 2018, requiring the PNRI to submit 

justification on the fund transfer as extra-budgetary contribution and how the amount was 

computed/determined. In the same vein, the PNRI submitted its justification and found 

compliant by the former Audit Team. In one of the Agency’s response to the AOM, it 

explained that the existing gamma irradiation facility needed an upgrade from its CY 2008 

enhancement. Similarly, the Cobalt-60 source requires a regular replenishment because it 

decays a rate of 12% per year.  Low source activity will result to longer irradiation time 

and lower throughput for the facility. Accordingly, the last Cobalt-60 source replenishment 

was made in 1989, 1993, 1996 and 2009, all through the technical and financial assistance 

of the IAEA.   

 

82. In the Agency’s letter to the former Auditor, it was stressed that during the 
replenishment in CY 2009 there was an increase of 180kCi but reduced to 65 kCi as of CY 

2016, thus the need to request contribution from the IAEA sourced from the Technical 

Cooperation Fund in addition to the Philippine cost share  in the upgrading of the PNRI 

nuclear facility and their expertise to elect and evaluate the appropriate suppliers who can 

participate in the procurement of the source and enhancement of the existing facility. Also, 

the item being requisitioned is not locally available and savings can also be generated since 

it is tax-free.  

 

83. In view of the justifications and exchange of communications between the former 
Audit Team and the Agency, indeed, there is a need to immediately implement the project 

to upgrade the gamma facility with the replenishment of the Cobalt-60 source to maximize 

the irradiation facility, effective and efficient in delivering the targeted services. Yet, 

despite such necessity, it was noted that there was delayed delivery of the transfers ranging 

from two (2) to four (4) years. In fact, no delivery yet on the procurement of Cobalt-60 

Source amounting to ₱43,068,097.20, which were transferred in CY 2016 and CY 2018, 

as of this date. 

 

84. The Project Leader of the TCP informed that the delay in the procurement of Co-
60 source for the multi-purpose irradiation facility was due to the following: 

 

a. Procurement has not yet started as late as the fourth quarter of CY 2018. Second 
source procurement was proposed to be integrated with the first transfer to save 

on the transportation cost. (CY 2018) 

 

b. Procurement process was undertaken starting CY 2019. Difficulty finding 
supplier of the source. (CY 2019) 

 



63 

c. Bidding is still ongoing. The bidder who participated has no offer for both the 
supply of Co-60 source and shipment. A separate offer for the transportation is 

expensive. Thus, new bidding was relaunched. (CY 2020) 

 

d. As of March 25, 2021, the Agency was informed that there is shortage of Co-
60 world-wide from major suppliers until 2022. There are small suppliers but 

the prices and delivery conditions are not good.  Moreover, due to the pandemic, 

there is difficulty in finding a forwarding company for the Co-60 sources. 

 

85. We noted that although the delay was justified in CY 2021 due to global shortage 
of Cobalt-60 source, an action could have been undertaken by the PNRI such as the close 

monitoring of the transfer which was made as early as CY 2016 in order for the IAEA to 

prioritize the procurement prior to the scarcity of the Cobalt-60 source. Due to the absence 

of close monitoring of the status of the transfer, apparent is the delay in the delivery of the 

source and facilities as shown in Table 17, which overall has its impact of also delaying 

the optimal delivery of irradiation services. Absent the upgrade of the Agency’s Gamma 

Irradiation Facility and replenishment of Cobalt-60 source used as the source of radiation 

for the sterilization of medical devices, decontamination of food and cosmetic raw 

materials, irradiation of agricultural products for various end objectives such as 

disinfestations, shelf-life extension, sprout inhibition and mutation breeding and pest 

control, these activities could not be efficiently undertaken due to the reduced emitted 

gamma rays coming from the Cobalt-60 source. In fact, it has been 10 years since 2019 

that the existing Gamma Irradiation facility of the Agency has been upgraded which to date 

has a  rundown facility with decayed sources.  Although there was an initial delivery of the 

self-shielded gamma irradiator which, however, was belatedly delivered, still lacking is the 

undelivered Cobalt-60 source, which is necessary to fully equip the Gamma Irradiation 

Facility through full automation.  

 

86. Moreover, as noted in the series of exchange communication between the PNRI 
and the IAEA, the Agency was deprived of the control in the utilization and administration 

of the fund primarily due to the absence of Memorandum of Agreement/Undertaking 

(MOA/U) or Standard Basic Assistance Agreement (SBAA). As shown in one of the letter 

exchanges, the IAEA expressed that the transfer is govern only by what is specified in the 

letter of the PNRI and the financial rules and regulations of the IAEA. Yet the letters sent 

by the PNRI to IAEA in the transfer of the fund did not contain any provision, limitation, 

term or condition in the utilization of the fund. In essence, the provisions that govern the 

transfer of fund is drafted only by the IAEA excluding the Philippine Government the 

power to negotiate and modify the terms in the usage of the fund. Effectively, in the absence 

of an official agreement, the Philippine government was at the disadvantage for lack of 

opportunity for it to impose its terms and conditions such as, but not limited to, the scope 

of work and specifications of the materials/facility, timeline for the delivery of goods and 

services and other important provisions relating to the fund. Further, the delay in the 

procurement of the Cobalt-60 source and the equipment to upgrade the facility can be 

attributed to the failure to enter into an official agreement for each party to prioritize its 

obligations and responsibilities within the timeframe indicated. 

 



64 

87. The bulk of the fund totaling ₱74,191,416.37 came from the Philippines, thus 
giving the Philippine Government the entitlement to at least secure a Standard Basic 

Assistance Agreement, which most of the United Nations Development Program has with 

the member states for joint project/program developments. Moreover, on the basis of the 

letter exchanges between the Agency and the IAEA, the IAEA recognizes the 

specifications and conditions provided by the PNRI in its letter, thus, showing that it is 

open for amicable stipulation of terms. Entering into a written agreement regulates both 

parties to compel and take into serious consideration its responsibilities embodied therein.  

It cannot be refuted that the absence of official agreement in the form of SBAA or MOA/U 

contributed in the leniency in the procurement of the materials/facility. Since the fund was 

transferred in CY 2016 and additional transfers in CY 2017 and CY 2018, it can be 

observed that there was delay in the delivery of the assistance by the IAEA.  

 

88. In view of the foregoing, the Agency should have initiated the SBAA or MOA/U 
to convey its terms and condition and display its authority on the fund in the manner that 

the transfer shall be given priority the moment the fund was transferred and SBAA/MOA/U 

was signed. Effectively, delivery of the facility and materials could have been undertaken 

promptly and will not cause the fund to be idle for more than two (2) years. The leeway in 

the transfer of the fund without measures in place, to see to it that the fund is to be 

administered effectively for timely delivery of the services, has contributed in the delayed 

implementation of the project. 

 

89. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. seek legal assistance from the DOST-Central Office Legal Division in the 
drafting of agreements for the transfer of funds for joint projects with 

International Organizations; 

 

b. direct the program leader/project coordinator to make representations with 
the IAEA in the immediate delivery of the source and closely monitor any 

development thereto; and 

 

c. henceforth, secure a Standard Basic Assistance Agreement/ Memorandum of 
Agreement/Undertaking in all its fund transfers internationally regardless of 

the recipient. 

 

90. Management explained that the delay in the implementation of the IAEA project is 
primarily due to the delay in the arrival and installation of the equipment/system for 

upgrading. This equipment/system worth €472,800 was procured under the IAEA 

Technical Cooperation project with cost-share from the Philippine Government. The 

equipment already arrived in the PNRI but cannot be installed by the foreign supplier due 

to COVID-19 restrictions.  Management requested IAEA for assistance in the procurement 

of the Cobalt-60 source since PNRI is still developing its expertise in procuring category 

1 radioactive sources.  However, the IAEA recommended that the Cobalt-60 source be 

procured after the installation of the upgraded facility to prevent or minimize loss of money 



65 

brought about by the loss in source activity (due to continuous decay of the Cobalt-60 

source approximately 1% per month) during shutdown of the facility for installation. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

91. The Audit Team maintains its stand, that despite such circumstances that prevent 
the installation of equipment in CY 2020 due to COVID-19, the delivery of the 

equipment/facility could have been made earlier even prior to the pandemic considering 

that the cost-share of the Philippine Government was transferred to the IAEA in CY 2016. 

The primary cause of the delay in the implementation of the project is the absence of a 

concrete delineation of duties, responsibilities and timelines that should have been crafted 

in an agreement as early as CY 2016. Such agreement will render the procurement and 

corresponding delivery of the equipment promptly wherein IAEA will actively and 

zealously undertake such activity within the set deadlines in response to the urgent need to 

upgrade the Gamma Irradiation Facility and replenish the Cobalt-60 source, and thus, avoid 

the delayed implementation of the project. 

 

Compliance Audit 

 

Non-compliance with the rules and regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of 

advances for payroll 

 

92. Non-compliance with the rules and regulations in the grant, utilization and 
liquidation of cash advances (CAs) for payroll due to: (a) several CAs granted despite 

prior unsettled accountabilities and lack of certification from the Accountant that the 

previous CAs were liquidated - ₱4,904,777.14; (b) delayed liquidation in the payment 

of personnel benefits- ₱4,590,857.03; and (c) payment of reimbursable medical 

expenses, monetization of leave credits, contractual salaries and honoraria through 

cash disbursement which can be conveniently paid by check-₱1,974,388.56.  
 

93. Disbursement by Cash vis-a-vis regulation in the grant for payroll are governed by 
Chapter 6, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 

Government Agencies (NGAs): 
 

Section 14 (c). No additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official 

or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him/her is first 

settled/liquidated or a proper accounting thereof is made; 

 

Section 15. Cash Advance for Payroll. Advances for Payroll shall be granted 

to Regular Disbursing Officers for payment of salaries, wages, honoraria, 

allowances and other personnel benefits of officials and employees. The 

Advances for Payroll shall not be used for encashment of checks or for 

liquidation of previous or other types of cash advances. It shall be equal to 

the net amount of the processed payroll corresponding to the pay period. 

Liquidation of the advances shall be made within five (5) days after the end 

of the pay period. Any unclaimed salaries/allowances shall be refunded and 

issued official receipt to close the account. 



66 

 

94. Section 2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated 10 February 1997, provides for the 
following general principles: 

 

“Ideally, cash should be handled under the general principles of the imprest 

system for which all payments must be made by check. In practice, however, 

there are certain instances when it may be very difficult, impractical or 

impossible to make payments by check. In such case, payments may be 

made by the disbursing officer in the form of cash through his cash 

advance.” 

 

95. Section 1.1 of COA Circular 2012-001 dated 14 June 2012, provides for the 
documentary requirements in the grant of Cash Advances (CAs) which requires for the 

certification from the Accountant that previous CAs have been liquidated and accounted 

for in the books. 

 

96. Section 5.9 of DBM Circular Letter (DBM CL) No. 2013-16 dated December 23, 
2013 prescribes the payment procedure through ExMDPS, whereby the Modified 

Disbursement System, Government Servicing Banks (MDS-GSB) shall pay the 

creditors/payees listed in the List of Due and Demandable Accounts Payable with Advice 

to Debit Account (LDDAP-ADA) not later than 48 hours but not later than 24 hours upon 

receipt of the said document from the National Government Agency/Operating Unit 

(NGA/OU) through: (1) Direct credit to the creditor’s current/savings Automated Teller 

Machine (ATM) account (CA/SA/ATM) maintained with the MDS-GSB; or (2) Bank 

transfer, if creditor’s account is maintained outside the agency’s MDS-GSB, where 

corresponding bank charges shall be borne by the creditor/payee concerned. 

 

i. Unsettled accountabilities prior to grant of new cash advances and lack of 
certification from the accountant — ₱4,904,777.14 

 

97. For CY 2020, 42 Cash Advances amounting to ₱4,904,777.14 were granted even 
if the previous cash advances were not yet liquidated or settled. As shown in Annex A, 

cash advances (CAs) were granted despite non-liquidation of several previously issued 

CAs ranging from one (1) to 25 held by the same Accountable Officer. Moreover, the grant 

is not supported by the Certification of the Accountant that previous accountabilities are 

settled for and accounted in the books prior to the issuance of the new CAs.  

 

98. The rule in the grant and liquidation of cash advance is clear that there shall be no 
grant until and unless previous grant is fully settled. This is evidence by the Certification 

coming from the accountant who is strictly mandated to monitor the liability of each 

Accountable Officers (AOs). Failure to liquidate automatically disqualifies such AO from 

availing a new cash advance. Any grants made while disregarding the rule for liquidation 

can be considered irregular for being contrary to the existing rule and regulations. Thus, 

grants made with the existence of unsettled obligation/liquidations render the new grant 

questionable. In other words, liquidation of previous cash advances is essential not only to 



67 

the approval of the advances but specifically as a condition in the grant of authority in 

requesting for a new cash advances. 
 

ii. Delayed liquidation of cash advances — ₱4,590,857.03 
 

99. We also noted that there were delays of three (3) to 235 days in the liquidation of 
CAs as shown in Annex B, contrary to Section 15, Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM for 

NGAs.  
 

100. Pursuant to the provision of the GAM, liquidation of the advances for payroll shall 
be made within five (5) days after the end of the pay period. The salaries for contractual 

employees made every after the lapse of 15 days should have been paid immediately 

considering the nature of the expenses as personnel services. Further, honoraria, 

reimbursable medical expenses and monetization of leave credits are personnel benefits 

due to the PNRI employees immediately upon approval of the claims. Effectively, 

liquidation shall ensue upon release of the payroll. 
 

101. The cash advance shall be considered liquidated upon the recording thereof by the 
Accountant in the books of accounts although not yet audited by the COA auditor. 
 

102. It shall be noted that the requirement of prompt liquidation within the prescribed 
period and liquidation of all previous grants prior to a new grant is placed to ensure that 

there is proper monitoring of advances in order to prevent accumulation of liability. 

Essentially, it is to strictly limit the granting of number of funds to prevent excessive and 

unnecessary expenditures.  

 

iii. Payment of personnel benefits through cash disbursement — ₱1,974,388.56 
 

103. Moreover, regular expenses such as reimbursement of medical expenses, 
contractual salaries and honoraria were paid using CAs, contrary to the provision on cash 

disbursement that all payments must be made by check and that only in instances when it 

is very difficult, impractical or impossible to make payments by check that cash payments 

may be resorted to. It runs counter to the mode of payment prescribed by DBM Circular 

Letter (DBM CL) No. 2013-16 in the utilization of Expanded Modified Direct Payment 

Scheme where payment for due and demandable obligations should be made directly to the 

payees current/savings/ATM account maintained with the MDS-GSB. Details of such 

payments are shown in Table 18.

104. The supporting documents attached in the grant of CAs disclosed that the grant 
pertains to various payroll for which amount owed to the employees were determinable 

and may already be made directly to the involved personnel. The general principles of 

availing payment through cash disbursements are explicit that it may only be resorted to in 

instances when it is difficult, impractical or impossible to pay in checks. Resorting to 

payment directly through the respective ATM payroll accounts of personnel will deter the 

possible loss or misapplication of fund considering the huge amount of cash held by the 

accountable officer and with high regard to the susceptibility of the cash to misuse. Further, 

it was noted that claimants of the various personnel benefits have their ATM payroll 

accounts maintained by the Agency such that direct payment may be conveniently paid to 

their payroll ATM accounts instead of cash disbursement. As a result, the Accountable 

Officer who is the Cashier accumulates numerous cash advances for her to liquidate within 

the limited period as prescribed by the existing rules and regulations. Considering such 

number, the handling of CAs solely by the Cashier became strenuous and time-consuming, 

thus, resulted in the delay of its liquidation. 

 

105. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Accountant to:  
 

i. issue certification before processing and granting a new cash advance 
to all Accountable Officers and observe that all previous cash advances 

granted should be liquidated prior to the grant of a new cash advance, 

pursuant to Section 15, Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM; 

 

ii. refrain from allowing Accountable Officers for the grant of CAs 
through cash disbursement for the payment of medical expenses, 

contractual salaries, monetization leave benefits and honoraria 

(personnel benefits) since they can be conveniently and directly paid 

through ATM payroll accounts of the PNRI personnel and henceforth, 

strictly observe Section 2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated 10 

February 1997 and Section 5.9 of DBM Circular Letter 2013-16; and 

 

iii. justify/submit explanation in the grant of CAs in the payment of 
personnel benefits through cash disbursement; and 

 

b. The Accountable Officer to: 
 

i. liquidate promptly the CAs granted following Section 15, Chapter 6, 
Volume I of the GAM; and 

 

ii. submit explanation on the delayed liquidation of CAs. 
 

 



69 

106. Management justified that the payment of various personnel benefits are due to the 
following: (a) For payment of Honorarium - in view of the limited number of employees 

who can be granted Honorarium, Project Leaders requested that it will be given in cash for 

them to share to other members of the Section and other employees who contributed in the 

successful implementation of the project; (b) For reimbursable medical expenses and 

monetization of leave credits - immediate use of cash by those included in the payroll is 

requested for convenience purposes. Going to the banks to withdraw was not recommended 

due to safety concerns; (c) Salary of contractual service - by the end of the year, cash was 

given to contract of service for outright deductions of under time and leave without pay 

since balance from cash allocations will be reverted by end of the year. Contract of service 

should comply with the submission of DTR by the last working day of the year for 

computation the actual deductions. Accordingly, Management does not have to take the 

risk of paying the salaries under accounts payable since revalidation of cash allocation 

takes too long for the succeeding year. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

107. The Audit Team maintains its stand that payment of all personnel benefits must not 
be through mode of cash disbursement. Instead, strictly observe/comply with Section 5.9 

of DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-16 that requires payment to creditors/payees listed in the 

List of Due and Demandable Accounts Payable with Advice to Debit Account (LDDAP-

ADA) through direct credit to the creditor’s current/savings Automated Teller Machine 

(ATM) account (CA/SA/ATM) maintained with the MDS-GSB and that cash 

disbursements may only be resorted to in instances when it is difficult, impractical or 

impossible to pay in checks or thru LDDDAP-ADA. 

 

Absence of Property Transfer Report/Deed of Donation for the purchased PPEs funded 

under Grant-in-Aid 

 

108. The absence of Property Transfer Report/Deed of Donation from the Source 
Agency of reported Grant-in-Aid (GIA) funded PPEs amounting to ₱179,953,946.57 

due to lack of coordination of the program/project leaders with the Funding Agency 

affects the proprietary/ownership of the Agency’s recorded PPEs. 

 

109. Section 17, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides the policy on the 
Acquisition of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) through Fund Transfer to other 

Government Agencies or Civil Society Organizations. It states that “the Implementation of 

projects through funds transferred to other government agencies may require the 

acquisition of the necessary PPE.  For proper monitoring and accountability, the following 

policies shall be followed:  

 

 Acquisition by Source Agency/Entity.     
 

 The source agency/entity shall record and monitor the PPE purchased out 
of transferred funds to CSOs when the PPE meets the recognition criteria 



70 

and the MOA/U provides that the PPE will be returned to the source 

agency/entity.     

 The source agency/entity shall monitor the PPE purchased out of transferred 
funds to other government agencies but shall not record the PPE until it is 

returned by the implementing agency.   

 The depreciation of recorded PPE shall be in accordance with Sec. 28 of 
this Chapter. 

 

 Acquisition by Implementing Agency/Entity.  
 

 The funds received from inter-agency fund transfer shall be recorded in the 
fund cluster for trust receipts as asset.    

 The implementing agency/entity shall record and monitor the PPE 
purchased out of inter-agency transferred funds when the PPE meets the 

recognition criteria and the MOA/U provides that the PPE will be donated 

to the implementing agency/entity. 

 

At the end of the project, the transfer shall be made in accordance with the 

MOA/U as in the following cases:   

 

Case 1 – The MOA/U provides that the PPE will be donated to the 

implementing agency/entity. 

 

Case 2 – The MOA/U provides that the PPE will be returned by the 

implementing agency/entity to the Source Agency/Entity. 

 

110. DOST Administrative Order No. 009, s. 2017 dated November 9, 2017 Item X, 
provides for the purchase, ownership and accountability of project equipment and other 

properties: 

 

111. Item X (2) Accountability for Equipment. The Program Leader shall be primarily 
responsible for all properties related to the project until the same are transferred/loaned to 

another entity upon project termination. The Program/Project Leader shall sign the 

corresponding Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) attested by the Property Officer 

of his/her institution and submit it together with copies of all purchase documents to the 

Funding Agency within thirty )30) days from the date of delivery. The Funding Agency 

shall then record and maintain the list of purchased equipment. (The Accounting Division 

to record the liquidation based on the submitted JEVs and provide the Property Office 

copies of PARs. The Funding Agency shall issue Property Transfer Report (PTR)/ Deed 

of Donation (the appropriate Property Section) to the Program/Project Leader upon written 

request from the Implementing Agency after the termination of the project. The 

recipient/end-user shall be responsible directly to Program/Project Leader. 

 

112. Item X (3) Ownership of Equipment. The Funding Agency shall initially own all 
equipment purchased through grant funds until such are transferred to other projects or 

implementing institution. The ownership of equipment shall be transferred subject to 



71 

existing government rules. The Funding Agency reserves the right to transfer ownership of 

such government equipment through Invoice Receipt/s for Property (PTRs) or execution 

of Deeds of Donation subject to existing government accounting and auditing laws, rules 

and regulations. 

 

113. As at December 31, 2020, the total Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) acquired 
by the Agency which was funded from Grant-in-aid (GIA) amounted to ₱179,953,946.57 

as reflected in the Financial Statements for Fund 184-MDS which is composed of Building, 

Office Equipment, Information and Communications Technology Equipment, medical 

Equipment, Technical and Scientific Equipment. 

 

114. The PPE balance was appropriately recorded both in the Property and Accounting 
Section. The Property Section disclosed that PPEs under their custody and safekeeping was 

properly maintained and accounted except for PPEs funded under Grant-in-Aids (GIA) 

which lacks the Property Transfer Report (PTR)/Deed of Donation (DoD) to be issued by 

the Source Agency (SA) in order to complete the transfer of ownership and accountability.  

The absence of PTR/DoD was due to the unresolved issues in the process of the transfer 

such as the responsibility to whom the initiative for transfer shall originate. 

 

115. The provision of Section 17(b) of the GAM requires that PPEs shall be recorded 
for trust receipts as asset on the condition that it meets the recognition criteria and the 

Memorandum of Agreement/Undertaking (MOA/U) provides that the PPE will be donated 

to the Implementing Agency (IA). Since the amount  of  ₱179,953,946.57 was recorded in 

the Agency’s accounting books, then it is understood that the PPEs recorded therein are to 

be transferred to the IA at the completion/termination of the project pursuant to the 

MOA/U.  

 

116. Moreover, embedded in the MOA/U of the GIA funded projects are the provisions 
of the GIA Guidelines in the purchase, utilization, accountability, and ownership of the 

purchased PPEs. Thus, the Project Leaders should have observed the provision of the 

MOA/U specifically in the ownership and transfer of the PPEs at the end of the project 

such as undertaking the initiative in the transfer of purchased PPEs.  

 

117. Without the Invoice Receipt/s for Property or execution of Deed of Donation, the 
ownership of said PPEs is still with the Funding Agency which restrain maximum 

utilization of beneficial and legal ownership of a certain property which includes the 

suppression of the transfer of ownership, restriction in its usage except for the project it 

was purposely acquired, limitation for repairs unless it is provided in the approved LIB and 

enjoyment of all the rights and fruits germane in its possession. Hence, the uncertainty in 

the propriety of the recorded and stored PPEs in terms of absolute legal ownership.  

 

118. We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Project/Program 
Leader to: 

 

a. revisit the MOA/U of all the completed/terminated projects and account all 
the PPEs acquired therefrom; 



72 

 

b. send a formal request with the Funding Agency the transfer of the PPEs 
pursuant to the MOA/U of all completed/terminated projects with the 

issuance of PTR/Deed of Donation; 

 

c. communicate and furnish the Accounting and Property Sections the transfer 
of all the PPEs with PTR/Deed of Donation; 

 

d. henceforth, regularly request for the PTR/Deed of Donation of all the PPEs 
acquired from a completed / terminated project pursuant to Item X of DOST 

Administrative Order No. 009, s. 2017; and 

  

e. regularly undertake the annual physical count of all PPEs within the custody 
of the Agency and properly fill up the “Quantity per Physical Count” for 

regular submission to the Audit Team following Section 38, Chapter 10, 

Volume I of the GAM. 

 

Irregular payment due to non-compliance with the prescribed rules in the computation of 

honoraria and lack of necessary documentation to support payment — ₱4,163,250.00 

 

119. Irregular payment of Honoraria due to computation of claims on the basis of 
DOST Memorandum Circular No. 001 s. 2003 dated February 26, 2003, and lack of 

necessary documentary requirements to support the payment for the services 

rendered in CY 2019, contrary to DBM-DOST JC No. 1 s. 2013 dated June 25, 2013 

and COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, respectively, amounting to 

₱4,163,250.00. 

 

120. Section 50 of RA 11465, or the CY 2020 General Appropriations Act, states that 
“the payment of magna carta benefits of public health workers, school teachers, social 

workers, scientists, engineers and researchers, and other science and technology personnel 

in the government shall be subject to the guidelines issued by the DBM." 

 

121. Section 53 (d) and (e) of the same Act provides that “Honoraria may be paid only 
to those who are involved in science and technological activities and render services 

beyond their regular workload and officials and employees assigned to special projects, 

subject to the following conditions: (1) Said special projects are reform-oriented or 

developmental, contribute to the improvement of service delivery and enhancement of the 

performance of the core functions of the agency, and have specific timeframes and 

deliverables in accomplishing objectives and milestones set by the agency for the year; and 

(2) such assignment entails rendition of work in addition to, or over and above, their regular 

workload. In these instances, the rates of honoraria shall depend on the level of 

responsibilities, nature of work rendered, and extent of individual contribution to produce 

the desired outputs.  The total honoraria received from all special projects shall not exceed 

twenty-five percent (25%) of the annual basic salaries.” 

 



73 

122. Section 53 further provides that the grant of honoraria shall be “subject to the 
guidelines prescribed under B.C. No. 2003-5 dated September 26, 2003, as amended by 

B.C. No. 2007-1 dated April 23, 2007 and N.B.C No. 2007-510 dated May 8, 2007, B.C 

No. 2007-2 dated October 1, 2007, B.C No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005, as amended 

by B.C No. 2007-3 dated November 29, 2007, DBM and DOST J.C No.1 dated June 25, 

2013 and such other guidelines issued by the DBM.” 

 

123. Section 4.3 of DBM-DOST Joint Circular (JC) No.1, s.2013 states that “as token 
payment for services rendered beyond the regular duties and responsibilities of their 

positions, Honoraria for Assignment in Special Projects may be granted. 

 

4.3.1 The total Honoraria per personnel for a month shall be based on productivity 
and quality of completed and accepted deliverables for the set timeframe.  

Hence, a special project plan shall be prepared, in consultation with all 

personnel concerned, subject to approval by the agency head.  Such plan shall 

contain the following details: 

 

4.3.1.1.1.1 Outputs or deliverables per project component; 
4.3.1.1.1.2 Project timetable 
4.3.1.1.1.3 Personnel assigned to the special project and their duties and      

responsibilities 

4.3.1.1.1.4 Expected deliverables per personnel; and 
4.3.1.1.1.5 Estimated cost of monthly honoraria for each personnel based on 

work hours spent beyond the regular work hours, computed as 

follows: 

 

Estimated Honoraria =      Salary  1 Month 1Day     T hours 

                    Month     22 Days 8 Hours 

   

Where:  

   Salary = Step 1 of the Salary Grade for the designated position 

   T= estimated numbers of work hours spent in the special project 

 

124. The above estimated computation of Honoraria per personnel per project is also 
initially expressed in the DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 2007-2 dated October 1, 2007. 

Further, said DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 provides for the following necessary 

provisions: 

 

Section 4.5. Payment of the honorarium shall be made only upon completion 

and acceptance by the agency head of the deliverable per project component. 

 

Section 4.6. The actual honorarium to be paid to each personnel shall depend 

on the performance rating to be given by the project management, as 

follows: 

 



74 

Performance 

Rating 

% of Estimated Honoraria per project 

Component 

Outstanding 100% 

Very Satisfactory 85% 

Satisfactory 70% 

 

For example, if the performance rating is Very Satisfactory, the actual 

honorarium to be paid follows: 

 

Actual Honorarium = 85% (H) 

 

Section 4.7  For rating purposes, the project management shall formulate 

a performance evaluation plan that is transparent and fair, and considers 

timeliness, quality of outputs, and other applicable work efficiency 

determinants. 

 

125. COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated 14 June 2012, provides for the following 
provisions and documentary requirements in the payment of honoraria: 

 

Section 5.7 General Guidelines. Government personnel performing activities or 

discharging duties in addition to, or over and above their regular functions maybe 

granted honoraria. 

 

Section 5.7.1 Special Projects. Documentary Requirements: 

a. Performance evaluation plan formulated by project management used as 
basis for rating the performance of members 

b. Office Order designating members of the special projects 
c. Terms of Reference 
d. Certificate of completion of project deliverables 
e. Special Project Plan 
f. Authority to collect honoraria 
g. Certificate of acceptance by the agency head of the deliverables per project 

component 

 

126. Item 3.1 of COA Circular 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 defines irregular 
expenditures to mean as “ the term ‘irregular expenditure’ signifies an expenditure incurred 

without adhering to established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, 

principles or practices that have gained recognition in laws. Irregular expenditures are 

incurred if funds are disbursed without conforming to prescribed usages and rules of 

discipline. There is no observance of an established pattern, course, mode of action, 

behavior, or conduct in the incurrence of an irregular expenditure. A transaction conducted 

in a manner that deviates or departs from, or which does not comply with standards set is 

deemed irregular. A transaction which fails to follow or violates appropriate rules of 

procedure is, likewise, irregular. 

 



75 

127. For CY 2020, the Agency paid honoraria to several employees for services rendered 
in CY 2019 under the Grants-In-Aid (GIA) Program of the DOST for special projects 

amounting to ₱4,163,250.00.  

 

128. The disbursement vouchers and its corresponding attachments revealed the 
following: 

 

i. Amount paid as Honoraria was computed on the basis of DOST MC No. 001 s. 
2003 

 

129. Management computed the amount paid as honoraria on the basis of DOST 
Memorandum Circular No. 001, series of 2003 which provides for a fixed rate on a given 

period contrary to the computation prescribed by the DBM-DOST Joint Circular No.1, 

s.2013 and DBM Budget Circular. For purposes of illustration, below is a sample of the 

actual computation made by management: 

 
Table 19. Honoraria rates under DOST MC No. 001 

Position 
Duration                     

(No. of Months) 
Honoraria Rate Total Honorarium 

Project  Leader 3 8,800.00 26,400.00 

Researcher L2 3 7,500.00 22,500.00 

Researcher L2 3 6,000.00 18,000.00 

Support Staff 2 1,500.00 3,000.00 

 

130. As noted above, there was no performance rating used in the computation of 
honoraria contrary to Budget Circular (BC) No. 2007-2. Further, the actual workhours 

spent by the personnel assigned for the project was not determined and formula prescribed 

by the Joint Circular No. 1 was not followed. Instead, a fixed rate was used on the basis of 

the repealed and old DOST Memorandum Circular. Following the fixed rate computed by 

the Agency, the payment could not clearly show the involvement made by the personnel 

nor it can be determined that the activity was indeed performed beyond their regular 

workload. As enunciated in the Joint Circular, the basis in the payment of honoraria shall 

be the productivity of the personnel involved and that special projects related activities 

shall be discharged of in addition to or over and above their regular functions. The above-

cited computation pursuant to the Joint Circular is necessary to see to it that the personnel’s 

regular workload is not compromised despite performing their duties in another special 

projects. Consequently, such vital information/details are also lacking in the submitted 

Disbursement Vouchers in claiming for the payment of Honoraria as discussed further in 

the succeeding paragraphs. 

 

131. Moreover, such deviation by the Agency of using a repealed and superseded 
circular/guidelines against the existing rules and regulations which prescribed for the 

computation that must be necessarily followed in the grant of all Magna Carta benefits is 

an apparent expenditure that falls within the ambit of COA Circular No. 2012-003 as an 

“irregular expenses.” As provided in the said COA Circular, irregular expenditures are 

incurred if funds are disbursed without conforming with prescribed usages and rules of 

discipline and that a transaction conducted in a manner that deviates or departs from, or 



76 

which does not comply with the standards set is deemed irregular. Here, the Agency 

computed the Honoraria to be given to its employees using an obsolete standard which was 

repealed by a new rule and is deemed obliterated and ceased to exist. The prevailing and 

applicable standards in the grant of Magna Carta benefits which provides for the prescribed 

rates and computation of Honoraria is the DOST-DBM Joint Circular No.1 which in this 

case was not observed.  Thus, the payment computed under DOST Memorandum Circular 

No. 001 s. 2003 contrary with DOST-DBM Joint Circular No.1 is deemed irregular. 

 

132.  As stipulated in Section 6 of Senate and House of Representatives Joint Circular 
No. 4 dated July 28, 2008, “DBM is hereby authorized to issue the necessary guidelines, 

rules and regulations on the grant of Magna Carta Benefits authorized for specific officials 

and employees in the government, thus the DBM, in coordination with the agencies 

concerned, shall determine the qualifications, conditions and rates in the grant of said 

benefits.  Accordingly, the consultative councils, departments and officials previously 

authorized to issue the implementing rules and regulations of Magna Carta benefits shall 

no longer exercise said function relative to the grant of such benefits.” Hence, the practice 

of using the fixed rate prescribed in DBM-DOST Joint Circular No.1, DOST Memorandum 

Circular No. 001 s. 2003 is no longer valid. 

 

133. Further, the repealing clause of the Joint Circular provides that all existing 
provisions or issuance on the grant of compensation-related Magna Carta benefits to S&T 

Personnel that are inconsistent with the provisions of this Joint Circular are repealed or 

suspended accordingly. 

 

ii. Absence of necessary documentary requirements contrary to COA Circular No. 
2012-001 dated 14 June 2012 

 

134. In the submitted Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) for payment of honoraria, only the 
following were attached as supporting documentation: 

 

a. Recommendation for the grant of Honoraria showing for the name, role, 
monthly/quarterly rate of the personnel involved in the special project 

b. Annual Progress Report  
c. Line- item budget 
d. General Payroll 

 

135. Absent in the submitted documents to support the payment are the necessary reports 
such as the performance evaluation plan used as basis for rating the performance of 

members, certificate of completion of project deliverables and certificate of acceptance by 

the agency head of the deliverables per project.  

 

136. Moreover, there have been no Terminal Reports submitted to the Audit Team that 
may suggest completion of the project in order to qualify for the payment of honoraria.  

Also, the annual progress report attached to the Disbursement Vouchers/ Liquidation 

Reports states for the actual start date but not the actual completion date. Instead, what is 

indicated are the expected completion date. The Joint Circular, Budget Circular and COA 



77 

Circular correlatively stressed that payment of Honoraria must be based on the productivity 

and quality of completed and accepted deliverables. The condition is if and only if there is 

completed and accepted deliverables shall there be payment of honoraria. 

 

137. Complete documentation in the payment of honoraria is necessary for the audit 
team to verify the accuracy of amount paid. The completion and accepted deliverables, the 

performance evaluation plan, special project plan, actual performance rating, timeframes 

and terms of reference, man hours spent by each personnel in the discharge of their duties 

in the special project beyond their regular workload, among others, are indispensable 

component in the computation of allowable amount of honoraria that personnel is entitled 

to.  

 

138. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. require the personnel concerned (payees) and Project Leaders to 
immediately submit the necessary documents required by COA Circular No. 

2012-001 dated 14 June 2012; 

 

b. henceforth, the Accounting Section to strictly comply with the computation 
prescribed by the DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013; and 

 

c. require the Project Leaders and corresponding Project (GIA-funded) 
Committees to undertake the conduct of special project plan and 

performance evaluation plan following the guidelines set by the DBM-DOST 

Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 dated June 25, 2013, B.C No. 2007-2 dated 

October 1, 2007  

 

139. Management informed the Audit Team that they computed the amount paid as 
honoraria on the basis of DOST Memorandum Circular No. 1 s. 2003 which provides for 

a fixed rate on a given period and they likewise,  sent a letter inquiry to the Department of 

Science and Technology requesting clarification on the audit observation because the 

honoraria received by the project staff involved in the special projects are based on the 

Line Item Budget of each project, which fixed and provides for the Honoraria rates 

following the DOST MC No. 001 s. 2003.  They further justify that Honoraria computed 

based on DOST MC No. 001 s. 2003 is lower than the DBM-DOST Joint Circular. 

 

140. They also informed that they assigned the Planning Section to undertake the 
conduct of special project plan and performance evaluation plan following the guidelines 

set by DBM-DOST Joint Circular No.1 s. 2013 and DBM BC N. 2007-2. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 
141. The Audit team maintained its stand that the Management should strictly observe 
the DBM-DOST Joint Circular, regardless of the resultant increase in the payment of 

Honoraria as the old DOST MC No. 001 s. 2003 was positively repealed and superseded 

by authorizing the DBM to issue the standards in the qualifications, conditions, and rates 



78 

in the grant of Magna Carta benefits in coordination with the agencies concerned pursuant 

to Section 6 of Senate and House of Representatives Joint Circular No. 4 dated July 28, 

2008 and DBM-DOST JC No. 1 s. 2013. Effectively, departments previously authorized 

to issue implementing rules and regulations of Magna Carta benefits shall no longer 

exercise functions relative to the grant of such benefits. Thus, the DOST alone cannot issue 

any other guidelines without the acquiescence of the DBM. Any issuance by the DOST 

alone which is inconsistent with the provisions of the guidelines issued by the DBM is 

inoperative and will not produce any effect. Thus the rates prescribed by the DOST MC 

No. 001 s. 2003 which is no longer effective, should not be utilized as the basis in 

computing for the payment of Honoraria.  

 

Non-submission of advance copies of Purchase Orders/contracts of the 

commitments/obligations reported in the LNYDDO  

 

142. The validity, regularity and enforceability of the commitment/obligation in the 
amount of ₱130,368,715.99 presented in the List of Not Yet Due and Demandable 

Obligations (LNYDDO) under FAR No. 3 cannot be ascertained due to the non-

submission of advance copies of Purchase Orders (POs)/contracts, pursuant to COA 

Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009. 

 

143. COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, provides for the submission 
of the copy of government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents to 

the Commission on Audit, among others, are as follows: 

 

Section 3.1.1. Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract 

by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, 

including government-owned and controlled corporations and their 

subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming 

part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of 

the agency concerned. 

 

Section 3.2.1. A Copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each 

and every supporting document, shall within five (5) working days from 

issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned.  

 

144. Under COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2013-1 dated March 15, 2013, “commitment” 
is defined as an obligation incurred by government agencies for which items have not yet 

been delivered and services not yet rendered. Additionally, “obligation” is defined as a 

commitment by a government agency arising from an act of a duly authorized official 

which binds the government to the immediate or eventual payment of a sum of money. 

Obligation maybe referred to as a commitment that encompasses possible future liabilities 

International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 19 providing for obligations 

from executory contracts under which neither party has performed any of its obligations, 

or both parties have partially performed their obligation to an equal extent. 

 



79 

145. Paragraph 5.6 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-16 refers List of Not Yet Due and 
Demandable Obligations (LNYDDO) as a list reflecting the National Government 

Agencies/Operating Units obligations charged against prior years’ budget for which goods, 

services and projects are not yet delivered, rendered, nor completed/accepted as of 

December 31 of the preceding year. 

 

146. The FAR No.3 provides for the List of Not Yet Due and Demandable Obligations 
(LNYDDO) in the amount of ₱130,368,715.99 as at December 31, 2020 as shown in Table 

20. 

 
Table 20. LNYDDO as of 31 December 2020 (FAR No.3) 

FAR No. 3 
Amount 
(In PhP) 

Total Percentage (%) 

Not Yet Due and Demandable Obligations  130,368,715.99 100% 

A. Current Year Appropriation 125,959,354.17  96.62% 

B. Prior Year Appropriation 4,409,361.82  3.38% 

 

147. Supposedly, these obligations constitute agreements entered into between the 
Agency and the suppliers/contractors. However, it was observed that the Agency 

particularly the Property and Procurement Section failed to submit the corresponding 

purchase orders (POs) and/or contracts relating to these commitments to the Audit Team 

within the prescribed period in observation of COA Circular No. 2009-001. In effect, the 

Audit Team was prevented to verify whether the commitments entered into are valid. 

Moreover, the regularity of these commitments cannot be validated as to whether the 

procurement activity was undertaken pursuant to the procurement law and the related 

guidelines and issuances. 

 

148. Essentially, the validation of the advanced copies of PO/contract is pursuant to the 
COA Circular No. 2009-001 to: (a) deter the notion that obligations were reported to avoid 

reversion of the allotments/fund at year-end: (b) to determine validity and regularity of 

procurement such that actual occurrence of the bidding was assured; (c) to establish the 

enforceability of the terms and conditions of the PO/contract indispensable in the 

computation of penalty for late deliveries or termination/cancellation of the contract 

agreement for breach; and (d) to deliver timely and relevant results. 

 

149. It is also noted that the 3.38% or ₱4,409,361.82 of the total LNYDDO pertains to 
obligations from Prior Year’s appropriations aging more than one (1) year but less than 

two (2) years. Considering the lapse of time that these obligations were outstanding for 

purchases/services that have yet been delivered, rendered, nor completed/accepted as of 

December 31, 2020, there is doubt as to whether these obligations were indeed valid that 

necessitates immediate or eventual payment. Further, in the absence of PO/contracts, its 

enforceability cannot be determined in order to establish delay that compels 

penalty/liquidated damages or cancellation of the contract/PO itself for breach or non-

performance of its terms and conditions. 

 

150. The LNYDDO prepared by the Accounting and Budget Section were also reported 
in the Financial and Accountability Reports (FAR) No. 1-Statement of Appropriation, 



80 

Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and Balances (SAAODB) which are deducted 

from the allotment of the Agency signifying to the Department of Budget and Management 

(DBM) the actual occurrence of obligation that compels eventual release of cash 

allocation/disbursement. Yet, in the absence of contractual agreement, the validity, 

regularity and enforceability of the reported LNYDDO cannot be assured to warrant that 

there is indeed an obligation on the part of the Agency and not merely to circumvent the 

lapsing of the allocated funds at the end of the year. 

 

151. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Property and 
Procurement Section to: 

 

a. regularly and timely submit advance copies of  POs/contracts with complete 
supporting documentation within the prescribed period pursuant to the COA 

Circular No. 2009-001; 

 

b. review the POs/contracts reported in the LNYDDO from Prior Year 
Appropriations and determine whether there is delay, breach that may cause 

termination, or any other necessary actions for immediate delivery of the 

purchases/services; and 

 

c. therewith, submit to the Audit Team the status and action taken for each 
PO/Contract from Prior Year Appropriations amounting to ₱4,409,361.82. 

 

Insufficiency of insurance coverage and non-preparation of Property Inventory Form  

 

152. Insurance paid in the amount of ₱3,005,283.24 could not be ascertained as 
sufficient to cover all insurable assets of the Agency as well as whether it has 

comprehensively covered all kinds of hazards and calamities due to non-submission 

of the Property Inventory Form and appraisal of the Agency’s insurable properties, 

thus, exposing the government resources to the possible loss caused by other 

adversities aside from fire due to the risk of non-indemnification. 

 

153.  Section 5 of Republic Act No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance 
Law, provides that “every government, except a municipal government below first class, 

is hereby required to insure its properties with the Fund against any insurable risk herein 

provided and pay the premiums thereon, which, however, shall not exceed the premiums 

charged by private insurance companies.” 

 

154. COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018, provides for the guidelines 
prescribing the submission of the Property Inventory Form (PIF) as basis for the assessment 

of general insurance coverage over all insurable assets, properties and interest of the 

government with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the Government Service Insurance 

System (GSIS). Pursuant to the Property Insurance Law (RA 656) as amended by the PD 

No. 245, it requires all government agencies to insure against any insurable risk their 

properties, assets, and interest with the General Insurance Fund (GIF), as administered by 

GSIS. 



81 

   

155. The said Circular defines Property to include vessels and craft, motor vehicles, 
machineries, permanent buildings, properties stored therein (i.e. furniture, fixtures, 

equipment, supplies and materials, etc.) or in buildings rented by the government, or 

properties in transit, the ownership of which had already passed to the government. It 

further states that it is only when such property or part thereof are not acceptable to the GIF 

that these may be insured with a private insurance company at a cost most advantageous to 

the government, subject to the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9184 

or Government Procurement Reform Act. 

 

156. The Agency’s Property accounts as at December 31, 2020, disclosed the following 
balances: 

 
Table 21. Insurable property of the PNRI 

Account Name Amount (Net Book Value) 

Buildings and Other Structures                242,926,009.98  

Machinery and Equipment 459,749,391.87 

Transportation Equipment (Motor Vehicles) 6,630,321.53 

Furniture and Fixtures and Books 4,989,281.58 

Other Property, Plant and Equipment 11,635,196.37 

TOTAL                 725,930,201.33 

 

157. In CY 2020, the Agency paid the amount of ₱3,005,283.24 to insure its buildings 
and its content against fire. The Disbursement Voucher (DV) and its supporting documents 

in the payment of insurance lacks the necessary information in order to determine the 

appraised value of the property and whether the details of those properties shown in Table 

21 are included in the insurance premium. Further, there has been no submission of the 

Property Inventory Form (PIF) nor was it attached to the DV, contrary to COA Circular 

No. 2018-002.  

 

158. Moreover, the insurance coverage of the ₱3,005,283.24 is limited to losses or 
damage caused by fire only and excludes the possible losses caused by earthquake, storm, 

flood, theft and other causes. The inadequacy of insurance coverage deprived the Agency 

of the adequate and reliable protection against any damage from other casualties aside from 

fire and ultimately exposes it to losses for non-indemnification in the event of other 

casualties beyond the insurance acquired. 

 

159. Following the provision of COA Circular No. 2018-002, the properties in Table 21 
should be insured directly from the GSIS GIF on the basis of its appraised value. Thus, the 

Circular direct the Head of the agencies to cause for the appraisal of the insurable properties 

and other assets of their respective offices. Therewith, it shall submit to the Audit Team 

and the GSIS the PIF containing valuable information such as the nature or type of 

occupancy of the property, location, date acquired/manufactured, the acquisition cost and 

the date of appraisal and its market appraisal value as a basis in pricing of the property and 

determining the premium to be paid to the GSIS.  

 



82 

160. Further, it was also observed that the GAA Appropriation of the Agency excludes 
budget for insurance contrary to the Section 5.1(f) of COA Circular No. 2018-002 which 

requires for inclusion in the agency annual budget the amount of premiums for the general 

insurance covering all insurable properties and to ensure its payment to the GSIS. It shall 

be noted that with the preparation of PIF and consequent appraisal of the properties, a 

specific budget for insurance must be secured in order to cover the premium payments.  

 

161. Thus, in the absence of the PIF, it cannot be determined whether: (a) the value of 
the insurance is appropriate taking into account the absence of its appraisal value; (b) all 

the insurable properties of the Agency were adequately covered by the premiums; (c) that 

the insurance availed of covers all kinds of calamities; and (d) lack of determined budget 

appropriated to insurance premiums to cover all insurable properties of the Agency. 

Ultimately, the agency’s insurable properties cannot be said to have been fully secured by 

insurance which in times of hazard, peril, or loss, such properties are at risk of not being 

indemnified. 

 

162. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. upgrade the insurance coverage of its buildings and its contents to include all 
natural and man-made calamities such as losses/damage from earthquake, 

storm, flood, theft and other causes; 

 

b. incorporate in its annual budget the amount necessary to cover the increase 
in premium relative to the insurance upgrade and to cover all insurable assets 

of the Agency; 

 

c. cause the appraisal of all the PNRI properties for accurate valuation of all its 
insurable assets;  

 

d. prepare and regularly submit to the GSIS and copy furnish the Audit Team 
the stamped received PIF from GSIS pursuant to COA Circular No. 2018-

002; and 

 

e. henceforth, consider including submission of the details of the property 
insured and its value as well as the insurance policy covered by the insurance 

premiums paid as necessary documents to be attached in the Disbursement 

Vouchers together with the PIF. 

 

Transfer of funds to foreign suppliers through Telegraphic Transfers in full payment of 

procurement of goods/services despite the prohibition on advance payment, 

issuance/release of checks prior to completion of deliveries and lack of certifications that 

no locally available suppliers/vendors —₱8,219,184.20 

 

i. Full payment despite prohibition on advance payment 
 



83 

163. Purchases amounting to ₱8,219,184.20 were paid to foreign suppliers in full 
despite non-delivery of goods and performance of services notwithstanding the 

prohibition on advance payment mandated by Section 88 of PD 1445 and Annex D 

and E of IRR of RA 9184. 
 

164. Section 88 (1) of PD 1445. Prohibition against advance payment on government 
contracts. Except with the prior approval of the President the government shall not be 

obliged to make an advance payment for services not yet rendered or for supplies and 

materials not yet delivered under any contract therefor. No payment, partial or final, shall 

be made on any such contract except upon a certification by the head of the agency 

concerned to the effect that the services or supplies and materials have been rendered or 

delivered in accordance with the terms of the contract and have been duly inspected and 

accepted. 
 

165. Annex D and E of the IRRA of RA 9184 pertaining to Advance Payment states for 
the following provisions: 

 

Annex D (For the procurement of goods/supplies/materials) 
 

 4.1 In accordance with Presidential Decree 1445, advance payment shall be 
made only after prior approval of the President, and shall not exceed fifteen 

percent (15%) of the contract amount, unless otherwise directed by the 

President; provided, however, that for cases mentioned under 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5 

of these guidelines, no prior approval by the President shall be necessary. 

 

Annex E (For the procurement of infrastructure projects) 

 

 4.1 The procuring entity shall, upon a written request of the contractor which 
shall be submitted as a contract document, make an advance payment to the 

contractor in an amount not exceeding fifteen percent (15%) of the total contract 

price, to be made in lump sum or, at the most, two installments according to a 

schedule specified in the Instruction to Bidders and other relevant Tender 

Documents. 

 

166. As at December 31, 2020, the balance of the account Other Receivables amounted 
to ₱84,449,848.86 which is used to record transfer of payment through telegraphic transfers 

in the purchase of goods/ services from foreign suppliers/ international 

agencies/organizations. Details of the account are shown below:

167. The Disbursement Vouchers of the transfers in the amount of ₱8,219,184.20 
disclosed, that these transfers were made as direct full payment in the purchase of various 

materials/supplies/equipment/services from foreign suppliers prior to the delivery of goods 

and performance of services, contrary to Section 88 of PD 1445 and the Annex D and E of 

IRR of RA 9184.  In the inquiry with the Procurement Section, it revealed that the 

purchases of ₱8,219,184.20 were procured from foreign suppliers because of the 

unavailability of local suppliers who market radioactive materials which can only be 

procured from countries that consumed nuclear energy. Further, attributed to the rareness 

of the radioactive materials which are only available abroad, foreign suppliers only allow 

the supply and delivery of the purchases upon full payment thru telegraphic transfers. 

 

168. However, the provisions of the Section 88 of PD 1445 and the Annex D and E of 
IRR of RA 9184 is clear wherein it prohibits transfer of any kind of payment for services 

not yet rendered or for supplies and materials not yet delivered under any contract unless 

approved by the President for procurement of goods, while only permits the 15% advance 

payment in cases of infrastructure projects. Also, documents supporting the transfer of 

payment to suppliers did not disclose any provision or terms relating to the constraint posed 

by the law that prohibits advance/full payment sans delivery. As noted, the ₱8,219,184.20 

purchases were all procurement of goods for which neither advance payment nor full 

payment maybe allowed. The prohibition was initially provided in the PD 1445 and later 

on adopted and given emphasis in the IRR of RA 9184 stressing for strict compliance. 

 

169. It is basic that the law is deemed written into every contract. Although a contract is 
the law between the parties, the provisions of positive law which regulate contracts are 

deemed written therein and shall limit and govern relations between the parties. Thus, the 

fact that the purchases was undertaken either through competitive bidding or alternative 

bidding the requirement to enter into a contract agreement or purchase order must be 

observed. Accordingly, the Agency’s agreement with the foreign bidder must comply with 

the laws, rules and regulations and shall mandatorily contain for the general conditions and 

terms of the contract which assert and underscore the restriction for full payment preceding 

delivery/performance of goods/services. The Management should not disregard its duty to 

see to it that all contracts entered into must still adhere and not contrary to existing laws, 

policy, and rules and regulations. Otherwise, said contract shall be considered void and 

have no legal effect subjecting all persons that authorized the payment be liable personally. 

 

170. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. require the Property and Procurement Section to: 
 

i. include in the terms and conditions of the contract with foreign 
suppliers the stipulation that forbid advance payment or paying in full 

prior to delivery of goods and performance of services in adherence to 

Section 88 of PD 1445 and Annex D and E of IRR of RA 9184;    

 



85 

ii. consider to avoid/refrain from procuring goods/services in direct full 
payment prior to delivery/completion of goods/services in compliance 

with Section 88 of PD 144 and Annex D and E of IRR of RA 9184; and 

 

b. submit explanation to justify the mode of paying foreign suppliers in full 
despite prohibition on advance/full payment even if there is absence of 

deliveries. 

 

Issuance/release of checks in full despite non-completion of deliveries 

 

171. The issuance/release of checks amounting to ₱8,219,184.20 prior to the 
delivery/completion of goods/services which is contrary to DBM Circular No. 2013-

16 dated 23 December 2016, resulted in the non-reconciliation of the balances between 

the Accounting and the Property in the receipts of purchases affecting the accuracy 

of the presented balance at year-end. 

 

172. Section 6.1.1 General Guidelines of the DBM Circular 2013-16 dated December 
23, 2013 provides that only valid and legal Accounts Payables (i.e. obligations incurred by 

the NGA/OU within the prescriptive period of the covering allotment and covered by an 

approved contract with specific creditors/suppliers) for which goods/services/projects have 

been delivered/rendered/completed and accepted shall be considered for payment. 

 

173. The recording in the account Other Receivables for the ₱8,219,184.20 with 
corresponding credit to Cash account concurrently with the actual receipt of the payments 

by the supplier revealed that payments transpired even before the delivery of items ordered 

or rendering of services. In short, suppliers are being paid in cash despite non-delivery of 

items ordered and non-incurrence of services. Remarkably, there were no attachments to 

the Inspection and Acceptance Report, nor any proof of delivery of items or services in the 

Disbursement Vouchers to conclusively show that payment was made when there were 

occurrence of delivery or performance of services from foreign suppliers contrary to 

Section 6.1.1 of DBM Circular 2013-16.  

 

174. Moreover, the Procurement and Property Section (PPS) disclosed that 
₱6,613,643.06 of the ₱8,219,184.20 purchases were already delivered yet still recorded in 

the book of accounts as shown in Annex C. The non-reconciliation of the balances between 

the Property and the Accounting Section relating to these purchases can be attributed to the 

practice of preparing the Disbursement Vouchers and issuing/releasing the check as 

advance full payment despite absence of delivery. Upon the release of check for transfer 

of payment to suppliers, the Accounting Section records the transaction as debit to Other 

Receivables while crediting Cash accounts. Thus, when the goods or services were 

delivered, the documents relating to the delivery were not immediately forwarded to the 

Accounting Section for payment and clearance, thus, the Accounting remained non-

cognizant of such receipt unless informed by the PPS.  

 

175. Supposedly in the normal course of processing disbursement payments, any claims 
against the government should have been cleared first with the Accounting Section and 



86 

should be supported by the necessary documents such as the Delivery Receipts, Sales 

Invoice, and Inspection and Acceptance Reports as basis for claims against the government 

prior to payment to establish its authenticity, authority, legality and regularity. 

Consequently, validation of the Audit Team of such deliveries to determine that there is 

indeed delivery accepted vis-a-vis recording in the books of accounts could not be 

undertaken due to the absence of such documents. 

 

176.  Hence, the lapse in the order of releasing payments prior to delivery/performance 
of goods/services resulted in the recorded Other Receivables account not being updated 

regularly upon receipt of procured goods/services and inaccuracy of the presented balance 

at year-end. 

 

177. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Property and Procurement Section to promptly update the Accounting 
Section of the deliveries from foreign suppliers and reconcile the 

₱8,219,184.20 balance; and 

 

b. The Accounting Section to: 
 

i. Review, analyze and reconcile with the Procurement and Property 
Section the reflected balance of ₱8,219,184.20 in the account Other 

Receivables and undertake the necessary adjusting/journal entries;  

 

ii. refrain from disbursing payment of purchases without complete 
documentations in strict compliance with DBM Circular No. 2013-16; 

and 

 

iii. regularly furnish the Audit Team with the copy of the Disbursement 
Vouchers (DVs) which includes the delivery receipt, sales invoice, 

inspection and acceptance reports. Should the DVs previously 

submitted exclude such documents, furnish the Audit Team a 

photocopy of the DV inclusive of such attachments for easy reference 

of the Audit Team to what DV it corresponds to. 

 

ii. Lack of mandatory Certifications for purchases from foreign supplier 
 

178. The lack of mandatory Certifications in the procurement of goods/services 
from foreign suppliers showing that the goods sought to be procured are not available 

from local suppliers invalidates the eligibility of foreign suppliers to participate in the 

bidding as prescribed in Section 23.4.1.2 and Appendix 9 of the Updated Revised IRR  

2016 of RA 9184. 

 

179. Section 4 of  RA 9184 provides that the Act shall apply to the procurement of 
Infrastructure Projects, Goods, and Consulting Services regardless of source of fund, 

whether local or foreign, by all branches and instrumentalities of government, departments, 



87 

offices and agencies, including government owned and/or controlled corporations and local 

government units, subject to the provisions of Commonwealth Act  

 

180. Appendix 9 of IRR of RA 9184 which was initially enunciated through GPPB 
Resolution No. 13-2019 dated May 23, 2019, provides for the guidelines in the 

determination of eligibility of foreign suppliers, contractors, and consultants to participate 

in government procurement projects which include among others the following important 

provisions: 

 

 4.1 In the procurement of goods, regardless of the procurement method used, 
foreign bidders maybe eligible to participate under any of the following 

circumstances: 

 

 4.1.1 When the goods sought to be procured are not available from local 
suppliers, subject to Item 5 herein; or (emphasis supplied) 

 4.1.2 When there is a need to prevent situations that defeat competition or 
restrain trade, subject to Item 6 herein; or 

 4.1.3 When the foreign supplier, manufacturer and/or distributor is a citizen, 
corporation or association of a country the laws or regulations of which 

grant reciprocal rights or privileges to citizens, corporations or associations 

of the Philippines, irrespective of the availability of goods from local 

suppliers, subject to Item 7 herein; or  

 4.1.4 When provided for under any treaty or international or executive 
agreement. 

 

 5.0 Goods Not Available from Local Suppliers 
 

 5.1 In the procurement of goods not available from Local Suppliers, the 
procuring entity may invite foreign suppliers, manufacturers and/or 

distributors to participate in the procurement process. 

 5.2 For purposes of these guidelines, goods are not available from Local 
Suppliers when, at any time before advertisement for their procurement, it 

is determined that no Local Supplier is capable to supply the required goods 

to the Government, in which case, foreign suppliers, manufacturers and/or 

distributors may be invited to participate in the bidding. Therefore, the head 

of the procuring entity or his duly authorized representative shall 

certify that, after diligent market research conducted by the procuring 

entity, the goods sought to be procured are not available from Local 

Suppliers. In addition, when applicable, the procuring entity shall secure 

a certification from the appropriate Government regulatory body, such 

as, but not limited to, the Bureau of Product Standards of the Department of 

Trade and Industry (DTI) for electrical products, mechanical/building & 

construction materials, chemical, foods and other consumer products, and 

the Bureau of Food and Drugs of the Department of Health (DOH) for 

drugs, medicine, and other related medical devices, that based on its 



88 

available records, the goods sought to be procured are not available from 

Local Suppliers. (emphasis supplied) 

 5.3 If despite the availability of the goods sought to be procured, no local 
supplier is interested to participate in the procurement process, the head of 

the procuring entity shall certify that it has advertised the same for public 

bidding and shall make a statement that no local supplier participated 

in the bidding and that the same is due to reasons not attributable to 

the procuring entity. (emphasis supplied) 

 5.4 In the case mentioned in 5.3, for purposes of inviting foreign suppliers, 
the bidding requirement and conditions, as advertised, shall not be modified 

or changed. Otherwise, modifications and/or changes in the requirements 

and conditions of the bidding shall disallow the procuring entity to resort to 

invitation of foreign bidders. 

 5.5 The procurement of unavailable goods must be through competitive or 
public bidding unless conditions prescribed under RA 9184 and its IRR 

warrant resort to alternative methods of procurement.  

 

181. The Procurement Section revealed that the purchases of ₱8,219,184.20 were 
procured from foreign suppliers because of the unavailability of local suppliers who market 

radioactive materials which can only be procured from countries that consume nuclear 

energy. However, it is noted that resorting to purchases abroad may only be allowed under 

the circumstances enumerated in Section 23.4.1.2 of the IRR of RA 9184. Thus, it must be 

shown with evidence that the procurement conformed with the relevant conditions imposed 

by the IRR of RA 9184. Relatedly, an eligible foreign supplier who meets the criteria 

imposed by Section 23.4.1.2 is not exempted from complying with the provisions on 

competitive bidding or alternative mode of procurement, whichever is applicable.   

 

182. In the Disbursement Vouchers relating to the ₱8,219,184.20, it was observed that 
the procurement lacks the necessary documents to justify the action of purchasing from 

foreign suppliers such as: 

 

e. In case of non-availability of local supplier: 
 

 certification from the head of the procuring entity or his duly authorized 
representative that after diligent market research conducted by the 

procuring entity, the goods sought to be procured are not available from 

Local Suppliers; and 

 

 certification from the appropriate Government regulatory body, such as, 
but not limited to, the Bureau of Product Standards of the Department of 

Trade and Industry (DTI) for electrical products, mechanical/building & 

construction materials, chemical, foods and other consumer products, and 

the Bureau of Food and Drugs of the Department of Health (DOH) for 

drugs, medicine, and other related medical devices, that based on its 

available records, the goods sought to be procured are not available from 

Local Suppliers; or 



89 

 

f. In cases that goods were marketed locally but no local supplier is interested to 
participate in the procurement process: 

 

 the certification of the head of the procuring entity that it has advertised 
the same for public bidding with the statement that no local supplier 

participated in the bidding and that the same is due to reasons not 

attributable to the procuring entity. 

 

183. The absence of the above-mentioned certification denies the eligibility of foreign 
suppliers from undertaking the bidding nor the preference of the Agency in availing for 

purchases abroad when the supplies/materials/equipment/services maybe procured locally 

and contrary to Section 23.4.1.2 and Appendix 9 of the Updated Revised IRR 2016 of RA 

9184. The Certification enumerated are vital in justifying for the necessity of preferring 

foreign suppliers. Absence of certification will invalidate the whole procurement and 

deemed considered irregular. 

 

184. It is worthy to mention that exhausting the availability of local suppliers for the 
necessary procurements of the Agency averts the requirement to make full payment 

through telegraphic transfers to comply with the prohibition on advance payment mandated 

by Section 88 of PD 1445 and Annex D and E of IRR of RA 9184. 

 

185. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. submit the certifications pertaining to the purchases from foreign suppliers; 
 

b. exhaust the availability of supplies/materials/equipment/services from 
domestic/local suppliers and give preference thereto; and 

 

c. henceforth, in cases that the procurement meets the condition under Section 
23.4.1.2 of the IRR of RA 9184, include in the Disbursement Vouchers the 

indispensable Certifications and strictly observed the guidelines prescribed 

in Appendix 9 of IRR of RA 9184. 

 

Other Compliance Audit 

 

Gender and Development 

 

186. The failure to submit the GAD Plan and Budget and its corresponding 
Accomplishment Report precluded the assessment on whether the appropriated 

budget for the Agency were effectively utilized in the implementation of gender issues 

and the determination if the identified policies, programs, projects and activities 

address the gender concerns of the PNRI employees.  

 

187. The Philippine Commission on Women- National Economic and Development 
Authority- Department of Budget and Management (PCW-NEDA-DBM) Joint Circular 



90 

2012-01 amending the Department of Budget and Management- National Economic and 

Development Authority- National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women (DBM-

NEDA-NCRFW) Joint Circular No. 2004-1 dated April 5, 2004 provides for the specific 

guidelines including the templates to be followed as Annex A and B in the preparation of 

Annual Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Budgets and Accomplishment Reports.  

 

188. PWC Memorandum Circular NO. 2019-02 dated August 01, 2019, provides for the 
Preparation and Online Submission of FY 2020 GAD Plans and Budgets. Item 1.2.4.2 

provides that “PCW-endorsed GPBs shall be authenticated by the Gender Mainstreaming 

Monitoring System (GMMS) with a QR code. Concerned agencies shall print the endorsed 

GPB for signature of their agency head and submit signed copies to PCW and their 

respective COA Audit Team, within 5 working days from endorsement.” Further, item  4.0 

therewith prescribes the submission of the GPB with the deadline set on or before 

September 16, 2019 for FY 2020 GPBs. 

 

189. On the other hand, PWC Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 
2021, prescribes the deadline for the submission to PCW of FY 2020 GAD AR which is 

set on or before March 12, 2021. FY 2020 GAD ARs submitted to PCW shall be 

authenticated by the GMMS with a barcode. Concerned agencies shall print the GMMS 

authenticated GAD AR for signature of their agency head and submit signed copies to 

PCW and their respective COA Audit Team. 

 

190. Due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a policy on adjustment and/or 
implementation of the FY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget was released by the Philippine 

Commission on Women to provide guidance on the revision and/or implementation of the 

FY 2020 GPB to implement GAD PAPs that address gender issues and concerns related to 

the COVID-19 situation. The following provisions are attending in the PCW Memorandum 

No. 2020-03 dated April 27, 2020: 

 

191. Agencies with FY 2020 GPB that has been endorsed or is still under review by 
PCW have an option to submit an adjusted GPB until 01 July 2020 for (re-)endorsement 

of PCW. Requests to reopen the access to the agency’s FY 2020 GPB submitted through 

the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) should be emailed to 

oed@pcw.gov.ph, copy furnished (cc): review.moderator@pcw.gov.ph and 

sysadmin@pcw.gov.ph. 

 

192. Agencies, whether with an endorsed or unendorsed GPB, shall reflect all changes 
made in the original FY 2020 GPB (e.g., cancellation/postponement of a GAD activity due 

to the Enhanced Community Quarantine or implementation of a new GAD activity to 

respond to the COVID-19 situation) in their GAD Accomplishment Report (GAD AR). 

Agencies shall also fill-out Column 10 of the GAD AR form to indicate deviations from 

the identified GAD activities and targets, if applicable. 

 

193. Section V of the COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2015, provides that 
“the Audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to 

the COA Audit Team assigned to the agency within five (5) working days from the receipt 

mailto:review.moderator@pcw.gov.ph
mailto:sysadmin@pcw.gov.ph


91 

of the approved plan from the PCW or their mother or central offices as the case maybe. 

Likewise, a copy of the corresponding Accomplishment Report shall be furnished the said 

Audit Team within five (5) working days from the end of January of the preceding year.”  

 

194. Section 31 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act of FY 2020 
states that, “All agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development 

(GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate 

and implement the applicable provisions under R.A. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, 

Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the 

Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development 

(1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022). The GAD Plan shall be 

integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) 

of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which 

relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment 

especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfilment of women’s 

human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient 

compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget shall be evaluated based 

on the GAD performance indicators identified by the said agencies.” 

 

195. In our letter dated January 26, 2021, and received by the Management on the same 
date, the Audit Team requested for the submission of the Annual GPB for CY 2020 and its 

corresponding Accomplishment Report. This was followed by a follow-up request to the 

GAD Chairman and Focal Person designated under PNRI Special Order No. 1462  s. 2019 

dated November 29, 2019, through email on March 30, 2021, for which the Agency 

responded. In the series of correspondents with the GAD Committee, the Audit Team was 

informed that GAD activities was suspended due to lockdown resulting in the non-

submission of the required reports. The GAD committee, however, commits to submit the 

Annual GAD Plan and Budget as well as the AR yet to date, no additional documents were 

received yet from the Agency. The GAD Plan and Budget nor the corresponding 

accomplishment report which shall be duly endorsed and authenticated by the PCW as 

prescribed by the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular 2012-01 were not furnished to the 

Audit Team contrary to the said Joint Circular and the attendant PCW Memorandum 

Circulars. 

 

196. Although there is limitation in the conduct of activities due to the pandemic, the 
PCW Memorandum No. 2020-03 dated April 27, 2020, provide for the 

amendment/revision of the previously submitted GAD Plan and Budget to cater to the 

current situation in order to have an attainable or possible targets.  

 

197. The absence of the GAD Plan and Budget hinders the Audit Team from identifying 
whether the targeted programs, projects, or activities (PPAs) for CY 2020 indeed 

responded to the identified gender issue, if there are definite and clear indicators and 

targets, the practicality of the proposed budget and achievability of the PPAs among others.  

Moreover, the absence of accomplishment reports (AR) prevented the Audit Team from 

ascertaining whether there was indeed actual implementation of the GAD plan and budget 

and  if desired results were accomplished.    In sum, it cannot be evaluated whether the 



92 

Agency’s GAD PPAs indeed resolved the identified GAD issues and whether there is 

efficient and effective utilization of the allotted budget for GAD under the GAA FY 2020.  

 

198. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the GAD Focal Point 
Person to: 

 

a. modify programs, projects and activities (PPAs), as necessary, to be included 
in the GPB or adjust the GAD agenda to include emerging gender issues and 

work conditions and thereby revise the allocation of budget appurtenant 

thereto to attain GAD outcomes and goals following the related PCW 

Memorandum Circulars such as the PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2020-

03; 

 

b. formulate GAD plans, programs and projects intended to address the 
concerns of gender issues as mandated by the GAA FY 2020 and their related 

accomplishments; 

 

c. closely monitor and evaluate programs, projects and activities identified to 
address gender issues in order to see to it that targets identified for the year 

shall be realized accordingly; and  

 

d. promptly submit to the Audit Team the GAD Plan and Budget within the 
prescribed period as well as its Accomplishment Report for the timely annual 

audit of the Commission on Audit pursuant to COA Circular No. 2014-001,  

PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 and related PCW 

Memorandum Circulars issued annually. 

 

Senior Citizens and Differently-Abled Person 

 

199. Due to the absence of formulated policy/targets/plans for PPA implementation 
specifically for seniors, the conduct of physical examination on seniors was 

implemented despite being not related to the mandated function of the Agency. 

 

200. Section 32 of the General Appropriations Act FY 2020 states that “All government 
agencies shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of 

senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, 

and integrate the same in their regular activities.” 

 

201. Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide architectural 
or structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety 

and welfare of persons with disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA No. 

7277, as amended.” 

 

202. Likewise included in the letter dated January 26, 2021 is the request to furnish the 
Audit Team of the approved plans, budget and expenditures and accomplishment reports 

for the programs/projects/activities relating to Senior Citizen and Persons with Disability. 



93 

As of this report, the Audit Team has not received any of the formulated plans and budgets 

for CY 2020, except for the following activities undertaken: 

 
Table 23. PPAs relating to Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability 

Programs/Projects/Activities Accomplishment 

SENIOR CITIZENS  

I. Established Office Order No. 005 on the Guidelines on the implementation of the 
Alternative Work Arrangement under the Community Quarantine dated 17th May 
2020 in line with the Inter-Agency Task Force Resolution No.35 dated May 11, 
2020 and the Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 10, dated 
May 7, 2020 which states that: 

“Division Chiefs are given discretion to allow work from home (WFH) 
arrangement particularly for employees below 21 years old, 60 years and above, 
those with immunodeficiency, and other health risks, pregnant women and those 
who reside in other MECQ areas.” 

Giving priority to Senior Citizens, 
especially those with co-morbidities to 
avail of the WFH arrangement while the 
city is on quarantine period. 

II. Conducted Annual Physical Examination on senior employees a. Performed physical examination 
and BP monitoring- 18 senior 
employees 

b. Performed random blood sugar 
count- 10 senior employees. 

 

203. As can be observed from Table 23, the identified PPAs did not reflect nor relate to 
the mandated functions of the PNRI. It must be noted that Section 32 of the General 

Provisions of the GAA strictly states that activities for seniors must be related to the 

mandated function of the agency and that it shall be integrated in their regular activities. 

Basically,   the absence of identified targets that specifically address the concerns of the 

seniors in their daily work undertakings negates the implementation of appropriate PPAs 

that may resolve and aid in the effective performance and delivery of their duties and 

works.  

 

204. The conduct of Physical Examination should have been properly lodged with GAD 
activities but not with the Senior Programs in the utilization of appropriated budget relating 

to it. Such activity cannot sufficiently be equated with the regular function of the PNRI 

which primarily centered in the advancement and regulation of safe and peaceful 

applications of nuclear science and technology in the Philippines. Further, no specific 

amount disbursed in the implementation of such activities thus negates the actual 

undertaking of such activity for verification.  

 

205. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of 
senior citizens and persons with disability which is directly related to PNRI’s 

mandated function and integrate the same the Agency’s regular activities;  

 

b. refrain from implementing activities that do not relate to their mandated 
function in accordance with Section 32 of the General Provisions of the 

General Appropriations Act (GAA); and 

 



94 

c. allocate funds for the targeted PPAs intended for these personnel as 
mandated by the General Appropriations Act of FY 2020. 

 

Youth 

 

206. The absence of formulated policy/plans/targets for youth displays minimal 
attention to address such concerns, contrary to Section 33 of General Appropriation 

Act  CY 2020. 

 

207. Section 33 of the General Appropriations Act of FY 2020 states that “All  agencies 
of the government shall formulate allocations for youth development projects and activities 

within the framework of Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).” 

 

208. Similarly, our letter dated January 26, 2021 includes the request for plans, 
programs, projects or activities relating to youth. Except for the activities undertaken in 

CY 2020 as provided in Table 24, no other report submitted to the Audit Team. It is worthy 

to note, however, that out of the three issues as funded and mentioned in the General 

Appropriation Act CY 2020, only the PPAs relating to Youth had been given considerable 

attention.

209. Yet, despite the existence of accomplishments for the youth, there has been no clear 
plans/targets formulated for CY 2020 that specifically address concerns collated from 

youth personnel for betterment of their regular task undertaking nor was the allocation. The 

absence of definite plans/targets for CY 2020 showed minimal attentiveness to carry 

programs/projects/activities designed to address such issues within the Agency and its 

integration in its regular activities in furtherance of its mandate. 

 

210. We recommended and Management agreed to continuously implement 
activities, programs and projects relating to youth development and formulate plans, 

programs and projects and allocate funds intended to address the concerns of youth 

as aligned in their mandate and integrate the same in the Agency’s regular activities.

the 218 regular plantilla employees to provide financial and administrative, atomic 

research, nuclear service, nuclear regulatory, technology diffusion and such other related 

functions as may be assigned.

i. As to ND No. 10-001 and 10-002-101 (10) dated December 14, 2010 and 
December 29, 2010, respectively 

 

218. As discussed earlier, on September 13, 2018, the Agency received a COA Order of 
Execution (COE) dated September 3, 2018, ordering that the disallowed amount of 

₱1,102,232.20  be settled immediately in full with regard to the Hazard Pay in CY 2010 

under ND No. 10-001 and 10-002-101 (10) dated December 14, 2010 and December 29, 

2010, respectively. The ND being final and executory, we required that the amount be 

settled immediately.  

 

219. Considering that the nature of such disallowance fell within the category of 
Personnel Services, Management immediately requested for installment payment of such 

disallowed amount, pursuant to COA Resolution No. 2017-021 dated November 3, 2017. 

This request was eventually granted by the COA-Legal Services Sector (COA-LSS) 

through a letter dated December 6, 2018. 

 

220. As of this report, the Agency has already effected deductions totaling 
₱1,091,519.94 against NDs No. 10-001 and 10-002-101 (10), leaving a balance of 

₱10,712.26 which pertains to the amount owed by those retired/separated employees and 

were no longer connected with the Agency 

 

ii. Longevity Pay overpayment 
 

221. COA issued ND’s for overpayment of LP due to erroneous computation for CYs 
2015, 2016 and 2017 paid by the Agency in the total amount of ₱9,219,160.90. All NDs 

were properly appealed. Since CY 2018 to date, the correct computation of LP was already 

complied with. 



99 

 

222. We reiterated our prior years’ recommendations and Management agreed to 
firmly enforce the settlement of all suspensions and disallowances pursuant to Section 

7 of the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) and furnish the 

Audit Team of the copy of settlement such as Official Receipts of Payment for 

eventual issuance of NSSDC and recognition in the books of accounts.
