iii 
 

Financial Audit 

 

1. The Assets, Liabilities and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts of the 
Philippine Nuclear Research Institute (PNRI) were misstated by ₱191,716,468.74, 

₱126,453,308.02, and ₱13,111,339.70, respectively, representing 13.43 percent of 

its total assets, 16.57 percent of its Liabilities, and 1.97 percent of its Equity due to 

various accounting errors. The misstatements had significant impact on the balances 

of the affected accounts, thus, the accuracy of the balances, completeness and 

existence of the said accounts could not be relied upon.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the: 

 

a. Accountant to: (i) analyze the Due from NGAs account and reconcile 
with the PS-DBM records, then prepare the necessary 

adjusting/correcting entries; (ii) prepare the necessary 

adjusting/correcting entries in the Other Receivables and Due from Non-

Government Organizations/People’s Organizations for the amount of 

₱74,191,416.37 following the Volume III of the GAM; (iii) inquire to the 

COA- GAS in written form on the appropriate account to be used in the 

accounting for the purchases directly made in full to foreign suppliers 

and adjust/correct the account, where appropriate; (iv) effect the 

necessary adjusting entries to correct the balance of Accounts Payable, 

Construction in Progress - Buildings and Other Structures, Information 

and Communication Technology Equipment, Office Equipment, and 

Technical and Scientific Equipment and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit; 

(v)reconcile the balances between the recorded Accounts Payable in the 

book of accounts and the FAR No.3, if applicable; (vi) recognize liability 

only at the time goods are received and services are rendered and 

contractor billings are accepted pursuant to Section 2(a), Chapter 6, 

Volume I of the GAM for NGAs and Item 4.6 of COA-DBM Joint 

Circular No. 2013-1; (vii) prepare necessary adjusting/correcting 

entries in the amount of ₱493,953.85 to reflect the correct balances of 

the Other Payables and Trust Liabilities; and (viii) record the collection 

of the sale of bid documents and mailing fees in the appropriate account 

in accordance with Item 6.2 of the Budget Circular No. 2004-5A dated 

October 07, 2005 and the Revised Chart of Accounts for National 

Government Agencies as described in Volume III of the Government 

Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs). 

 

b. Property Section Head to regularly update the Accounting Unit of the 
deliveries from PS-DBM and furnish copies of the APR, Certificate of 

Balance, Delivery Receipts and Agency Summary of Payments and 

Deliveries to facilitate matching of payments against deliveries; 

 

c. Property Section Head and Accountant to: (i) make representations 
with the PS-DBM in order to use the remaining idle funds in 



iv 
 

purchasing current common use supplies, materials or equipment 

requirements while limiting the transfer of funds unless idle funds in 

the PS-DBM is exhausted; (ii) coordinate with PS-DBM and reconcile 

the prior year balance by matching the Agency Procurement Request 

(APR) with the paid checks and the Delivery Receipts/Sales Invoice 

appearing in the DBM-PS records as against the Property records and 

the Accounting general ledger; and (iii) reconcile periodically on the 

advances forwarded and received by the PS-DBM vis a vis the deliveries 

received and undelivered for accurate reporting of balances. 

 

2. Unreconciled difference of PPE balance between the Accounting and Property — 
₱226,022,307.80; inclusion of unserviceable PPEs in both the Accounting and 

Property records — ₱20,862,880.64; and non-inclusion of completed building 

structure in the Property records — ₱5,031,944.17 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) create an Inventory 

Committee composed of adequate members designated specifically to conduct 

the physical count of all its PPE for the one-time cleansing of PPE balances for 

the period of three months or less and observe the step-by-step procedure 

pursuant to the COA Circular 2020-006; (b) regularly undertake the annual 

physical count of all PPEs within the custody of the Institute and properly 

filled-up the “Quantity per Physical Count” for regular submission to the 

Audit Team following Section 38, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM; (c) 

instruct the Property and Accounting Section to periodically reconcile for 

check and balance together with the PPE Inventory Committee for the noted 

exceptions pursuant to Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM; and (d) 

instruct the Property Section to: (i) prepare the IIRUP as the basis for the 

Accounting to account in the books the unserviceable properties amounting to 

₱20,862,880.64 pursuant to Section 79 of PD 1445 and Section  40(d), Volume I 

, Chapter 10 and Appendix 74 Volume II of the GAM; (ii) therewith, promptly 

dispose appropriately the unserviceable PPEs following NBC No. 425 dated 

January 28, 1992; and (iii) recognize in the property records specifically the 

Property Card the completed infrastructure building pursuant to Section 20, 

Chapter 10 Volume I of the GAM. 

 

Program Budget Utilization 

 

3. The failure to enter into Memorandum of Agreement between the Agency and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency for the procurement of various 

supplies/materials/equipment amounting to ₱74,191,416.37 resulted in the delayed 

implementation of the project “Enhancing the Safety and Throughput of the Gamma 

Irradiation Facility” and loss of opportunity for the government to bargain and 

enforce the undertaking of the procurement in an effective and timely manner. 

 

We recommend and Management agreed to: (a) seek legal assistance from the 

DOST-Central Office Legal Division in drafting for agreements in the transfer 



v 
 

of funds for joint projects with International Organizations; (b) direct the 

program leader/project coordinator to make representation in the IAEA in the 

immediate delivery of the source and closely monitor any development thereto; 

and (c) henceforth, secure a Standard Basic Assistance 

Agreement/Memorandum of Agreement/Undertaking in all its fund transfers 

internationally regardless of the recipient. 

 

Compliance Audit 

 

4. Irregular payment of Honoraria due to computation of claims on the basis of DOST 
Memorandum Circular No. 001 s. 2003 dated February 26, 2003, and lack of

rendered in CY 2019, contrary to DBM-DOST JC No. 1 s. 2013 dated June 25, 

2013 and COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, respectively, amounting to

henceforth, the Accounting Section to strictly comply with the computation 

prescribed by the DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013; and (c) require 

the Project Leaders and corresponding Project (GIA-funded) Committees to 

undertake the conduct of special project plan and performance evaluation plan 

following the guidelines set by the DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 

dated June 25, 2013, B.C No. 2007-2 dated October 1, 2007  

 

5. Transfer of funds to foreign suppliers through Telegraphic Transfers in full payment 
of procurement of goods/services despite the prohibition on advance payment, 

issuance/release of checks prior to completion of deliveries and lack of mandatory 

certifications that no available local suppliers/vendors —₱8,219,184.20 

 

We recommend and Management agreed to: (a) submit explanation to justify 

the mode of paying foreign suppliers in full despite prohibition on advance/full 

payment even if there is absence of deliveries; (b) submit the mandatory 

certifications pertaining to the purchases from foreign suppliers; (c) exhaust
