High fund utilization/obligation rate



2)			Overall, the agency’s fund utilization/obligation of ₱96.089 million is 94.86 percent compared to its allotment of ₱101.295 million, of which ₱31.816 million or 33.11 percent pertains to one of its major program, the Design Innovation Promotion and Industry Development Program, which registered also a high utilization rate of 95.33 percent and in accordance with the purpose of appropriation/allotment. The unutilized fund of ₱5.206 million was due to the reduced physical/operational capacity due to Covid-19 pandemic resulting to a reduced consumption of office supplies and materials, utilities, and retirement of regular employees.

All fees, charges, assessments, and other receipts or revenues collected, trust receipts and performance bonds and deposits, among others, except as authorized by law to be retained by the agency for its use, were deposited/remitted to the National Treasury pursuant to Sections 4 to 14 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA (Receipts and Income).

6)			There were no funds transferred to National Government Agencies (NGAs), Local Government Units (LGUs), Government Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) and Non-Government Organizations/People’s Organizations (NGOs/POs) during the year nor in the prior years.

7)			Fund transfers to Procurement Service-Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) and Philippine International Trade Center (PITC) amounting to ₱0.116 million and ₱13.875 million, respectively, for the procurement of various goods and services remained unliquidated as of year-end.   Non-delivery of the goods and services delayed the intended use thereof in the operation of the agency.

During the year, ₱1.336 million was transferred to PS-DBM for the purchase of common use supplies and ₱1.232 or 92.22 percent was liquidated, leaving a balance of ₱0.104 million. The beginning balance of fund transfer from prior years amounted to ₱0.025 million and ₱0.013 million or 52.00 percent was liquidated, leaving a balance of ₱0.012 million. The liquidation last year for the prior year’s cash advances of 100.00 percent is higher than this year’s prior year’s liquidation of 52.00 percent.



The total balance of ₱0.116 million pertains to undelivered goods that were unavailable at the time of the receipt of Agency Procurement Request (APR) by the PS-DBM but the agency may issue a supplemental APR to replace all unavailable stocks with another common-use supplies that are currently available on stock.



Moreover, there is no fund transfer to PTIC this year.  The balance of fund transfer to PITC pertains to the procurement of furniture and fixtures of the agency amounting to ₱13.875 million that was transferred on March 22, 2019 but remained unliquidated as of year-end.



The delivery of the said furniture and fixtures during CY 2020 was affected due to the lockdown implemented by the government to prevent the spread of COVID-19 virus.   In addition, the agency decided to conduct a detailed and extensive revisions of the original Terms of Reference (TOR) to address the new normal office design protocols as a result of the pandemic such as social distancing and recommended engineering/barrier controls. 



The undelivered goods and services from PS-DBM and PITC deprived the agency of its timely use of the items necessary in its operations. The agency failed to strictly and closely monitor the delivery, otherwise, the items could have all been delivered within the year the transfers were made.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	issue supplemental APR to PS-DBM to replace all unavailable stocks with another common-use supplies to fully utilize the previous fund transfer; and



b)	refrain from revising the TOR and closely monitor the delivery of all unliquidated fund transfer.



Dormant accounts for write-off



8)			The agency has no dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers for write-off, in accordance with Section 8.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



Insurance of physical assets with GSIS  



9)			The agency insured with the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) property amounting to ₱17.267 million with corresponding insurance premiums paid in the amount of ₱0.305, in accordance Republic Act (RA) No. 656, otherwise known as the “Property Insurance Law” as amended by Presidential Decree No. 245 dated July 13, 1973.



Disposal of unserviceable property



10)			The agency has no unserviceable property subject for disposal, in compliance with Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445.



Procurement of goods, consultancy services and infrastructure projects 



11)			This year’s procurement of goods and services and, consultancy services, amounting to ₱29.713 million, and ₱0.576 million, respectively, were in accordance with the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulation (IRR) of RA No. 9184 (Procurement Law). 

	

	

	

	

	Delayed submission of government contracts 



12)			Copy of 62 government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents with corresponding amount of ₱15.311 million were not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from one to 179 days as of year-end, thus, prevented the audit team from reviewing the said contracts on time. Nonetheless, 106 contracts that were submitted on time were reviewed and found in order.



Item 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 provides that the copy of approved contracts (Contract Agreement, Memorandum of Agreement, Job Order, Consultancy Contract, etc.) should be submitted within five (5) working days from the execution thereof.



Moreover, item 3.2.1 of the same COA Circular provides that a copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor.



Audit disclosed that 62 or 36.90 percent of 168 contracts/POs, amounting to ₱15.310 million were not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from one to 179 days, thus, prevented the audit team from reviewing the said contracts and purchase orders on time. It is worthy to note that there was an improvement in the submission this year compared to last year wherein 102 or 38.78 percent of 263 contracts/POs were submitted with delay.

The records section failed to monitor the submission of contract of service and the supply and procurement unit failed to monitor the submission of purchase orders, hence, this is a reiteration of previous observation. Nonetheless, all contracts that were submitted were found in order.



The Management commented that the recommendation last year was not implemented due to the delays encountered in the recruitment process, whereby the supposed plantilla position when filled, will oversee the monitoring of submission of contracts and POs.



We recommended and Management agreed to designate a regular employee to monitor the submission of contracts and POs within the prescribed time as mentioned above.

Hiring of and payments to job orders, contractual and consultants



17)			The agency hired 54 individuals covered with Contract of Service (COS) or Job Order as of December 31, 2020 on a semestral basis, in accordance with CSC-COA- DBM Joint Circular No. 2 s. 2020 dated October 20, 2020 to augment the regular plantilla employees of 30, due to the increased volume of the center’s activities attributed to the increase of coverage of its mandate from, industrial design to all creative sectors. Their salaries were charged against Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) – Consultancy Services & Other Professional Services in the total amount of ₱20.081 million, as authorized under DBM Circular Letter (CL) No. 2013-5 dated July 22, 2013.

Non-submission of approved GAD Plan and Budget



18)			The Center failed to obtain the endorsement/approval of Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) on their GPB CY 2020 due to the failure of the designated focal persons to submit the necessary documents within the prescribed period which prevented the audit team from validating the compliance of the agency with the required allocation of at least five percent of their budget. 

	

	Section 31 of RA No. 11465   provides that:

	

	“All Agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).

	

	The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent of their budgets”

	

	As required under the law, each agency should formulate a Gender and Development Plan in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent of their budgets. However, the duly approved/endorsed GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for CY 2020 was not submitted to COA, contrary to the provision of item V of the COA Circular 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014, which states that “The Audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit team assigned to the agency within five working days from the receipt of the approved plan from PCW or their mother or central offices, as the case may be.”

	

	The Center failed to obtain the endorsement of the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), the agency tasked to review the GPBs of government agencies due to lack of background and training on the proper usage of the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) that resulted in the non-submission of the GPB to PCW. The GMMS account of the Center has been inactive after its last endorsement of the GPB in CY 2016. Hence, the audit team was prevented from validating the compliance of the agency with the R.A. No. 11465.

	

	We recommended and Management agreed to require the GAD focal person to attend PCW’s seminars on the proper submission and preparation of GPB.
