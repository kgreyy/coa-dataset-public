EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



A)		Introduction

	

	The Design Center of the Philippines (DCP) or the Center is an attached agency of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and was created by Presidential Decree (PD) No. 279 dated August 24, 1973. On February 27, 1987, Executive Order (EO) No. 133 was issued reorganizing DTI and its attached agencies. The Center was renamed into Product Development and Design Center of the Philippines (PDDCP). The Department Order No. 11-47 entitled “Restructuring of the Department of Trade and Industry” was issued on September 29, 2011 by the DTI Secretary, placing the PDDCP under the supervision and control of the Office of the Undersecretary for Regional Operations and Development Group (RODG) of DTI.

		

The President approved on May 15, 2013 the Republic Act (RA) No. 10557 entitled “An Act Promoting and Strengthening Filipino Design, Providing for the Purpose a National Design Policy and Reengineering” or otherwise known as the “Philippine Design Competitiveness Act of 2013”, renaming the PDDCP into the DCP. 



Under DTI Department Order No. 13-35 Series of 2013 entitled “Amendment to Department Order No. 11-47 dated July 23, 2013, the supervision and control of DCP was transferred from RODG to the Undersecretary for Trade and Investment Promotion Group (TIPG). 



 DCP is mandated to promote design as (a) a creative tool for improving the quality, competitiveness, and branding of Filipino products in the global market;  (b) a strategic tool of value creation for sustainable economic growth and development; and (c) an innovative tool for enhancing the quality of human life.

	

The DCP is headed by Executive Director Maria Rita O. Matute, supported by six chiefs of operating divisions, namely: (a) Design Division; (b) Graphics Division; (c) Research Division; (d) Promotion Division; (e) Finance Division; and (f) Administrative Division. 



Of the 140 authorized itemized plantilla positions, only 30 were filled up as of December 31, 2020 due to difficulty in hiring personnel owing to its unique mandate, vision and mission that entails highly specialized job competencies and soft-skill profiles offering a smaller number of qualified applicants. In addition to these filled up positions, DCP hired 54 individual Contract of Service to augment its workforce.

C)	Scope and Objectives of Audit

	

	The audit covered the accounts, transactions and operations of the DCP for CY 2020. It was conducted to (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and      (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations. 



D)	 Independent Auditor’s Report

	

	An unqualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements, which presented fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Design Center of the Philippines as at December 31, 2020, and its financial performance, cash flows, changes in net assets/equity, comparison of budget and actual amounts and notes to financial statements for the year then ended in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards.

	

E)	Significant Observation and Recommendation



	1)		Fund transfers to Procurement Service (PS) and Philippine International Trade Center (PITC) amounting to ₱0.116 million and ₱13.875 million, respectively, for the procurement of various goods and services remained unliquidated as of year-end.   Non-delivery of the goods and services delayed the intended use thereof in the operation of the agency. (Observation No. 7)



We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	issue supplemental APR to PS-DBM to replace all unavailable stocks with another common-use supplies to fully utilize the previous fund transfer; and



b)	refrain from revising the TOR and closely monitor the delivery of all unliquidated fund transfer.



	2)		Copy of 62 government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents with corresponding amount of ₱15.311 million were not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from one to 179 days as of year-end, thus prevented the audit team from reviewing the said contracts on time. (Observation No. 12)



We recommended and Management agreed to designate a regular employee to monitor the submission of contracts and POs within the prescribed time as mentioned above.



	3)		The Center failed to obtain the endorsement/approval of Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) on their GPB CY 2020 due to the failure of the designated focal persons to submit the necessary documents within the prescribed period which prevented the audit team from validating the compliance of the agency with the required allocation of at least five percent of their budget. (Observation No. 18)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the focal person to attend PCW’s seminars on the proper submission and preparation of GPB.



The observations and recommendations were discussed with concerned officials during the exit conference conducted on March 16, 2021. Their comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate.









F)	Enforcement of Settlement of Accounts

	

There are no outstanding audit suspensions, disallowances and charges as of December 31, 2020. 



G)	Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations



All two audit recommendations contained in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report were not implemented as at year-end, thus, reiterated in this report.
