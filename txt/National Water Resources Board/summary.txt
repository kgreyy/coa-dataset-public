EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)	Introduction



The National Water Resources Board (NWRB) or the Board, formerly known as the National Water Resources Council (NWRC), was created by virtue of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 424 dated March 1974 and later reorganized in 1987 under Executive Order (EO) No. 124-A.

	

The Board is the lead government agency in the Philippine Water Sector, conferred with policy-making, regulatory and quasi-judicial functions. It is responsible for ensuring the optimum exploitation, utilization, development, conservation and protection of the country's water resource, consistent with the principles of Integrated Water Resource Management.

	

The NWRB's functions and responsibilities are three-fold, as follows:

	

--	Formulation and coordination of policies, programs and standards relating to the Philippine Water Sector;

--	Management and regulation of all water-related activities; and

--	Regulation and monitoring of water utilities.



The Board, composed of five cabinet secretaries, a representative from the academe and the executive director, is chaired by the Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). Although independent, insofar as its regulatory and quasi-judicial functions are concerned, the NWRB is under the administrative supervision of the DENR, as an attached agency. The Board is supported by full time working staff headed by Dr. Sevillo D. David, Jr., Executive Director. As of December 31, 2020, it has a total of 124 plantilla positions, of which 105 are currently filled-up while 19 are still vacant and supplemented by 74 contract of service individuals.

E)		Significant Observations and Recommendations



1)	The Board has no fund transfer in the current year. However, fund transfers to NGAs and GOCCs for implementation of projects in prior years amounting to ₱3.145 million and ₱1.352 million, respectively, remained unliquidated for more than 30 years, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013. (Observation No. 6)



We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	promptly exert effort in locating the related records for those undocumented fund transfers. If prove futile, consider requesting for write-off of accounts; and



b)	strictly observe the rules and regulations in the grant and liquidation of fund transfer as provided for in COA Circular No. 94-013 in future fund transfers.



2)	Dormant receivable accounts amounting to ₱96.301 million were not requested for write-off, as required under Section 8.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. (Observation No. 8)



We recommended and Management agreed to work out on the required documentations on the request for authority to write-off the dormant accounts and file said request before the COA pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-05.



3)	Unserviceable property with book value of ₱0.470 million remained not disposed of, contrary to Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, thus, exposing them to further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value. (Observation No. 10)



We recommended and Management agreed to:

				a)	assign new members to the Disposal Committee and to adopt measures in the workplace to address the scheduling difficulties brought about by the pandemic; and



				b)	instruct the DC to immediately inspect the unserviceable property.



4)	Copy of 93 government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents with corresponding amount of ₱28.325 million were not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from one to 154 days as of year-end, inconsistent with Items 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009. The 210 contracts, Pos and supporting documents were verified to be complete and in order. (Observation No. 12)

	

	We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned officers/staff to:

	

	a)	Identify the office responsible for the submission of the copy of contracts and POs to the audit team to avoid non-submission of the same.



	b)	consider the submission of the contracts and POs thru electronic means, if physical documents cannot be submitted due to the present situation; and



	c)	ensure that contracts and purchase orders, together with its supporting documents, are submitted to the audit team within five days from issuance as prescribed by law and applicable rules and regulations.



The observations and recommendations were communicated with the agency officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda and were discussed in an Exit Conference held virtually on April 13, 2021. Management comments were considered in the report, where appropriate.

	

	

F)	Enforcement of Settlement of Accounts

	

No audit suspension, disallowances and charges were issued and settled during the year. There were also no unsettled audit suspensions, disallowances and charges in prior years.
