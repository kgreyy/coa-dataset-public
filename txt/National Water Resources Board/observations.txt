PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)	Financial Audit

	

	Unqualified opinion on the financial statements

	

1)	An unqualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements (FSs), which presented fairly, in all material respects, the financial position as of December 31, 2020, and its financial performance, cash flows, changes in net assets/equity, comparison of budget and actual amounts and notes to financial statements for the year then ended in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards.

	

Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 provides that “Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position; financial performance, and cash flow of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs.”



The following errors/omissions amounting to ₱66,424,875.53 were adjusted/corrected by the Accountant, as follows:

Amount

			a)	Erroneous recording of mobilization fees as Construction in Progress instead of Advances to Contractors

₱  1,358,740.00

			b)	Set-up of payables for goods and services not yet delivered

28,138,234.00

			c)	Recording of Construction in Progress without supporting documents  since no construction was actually made

29,496,974.00

			d)	Derecognition of undisposed PPE from the books

735,055.80

			e)	Computer Software recorded as PPE

2,199,082.04

			f)	Non-recording of Impairment Losses

4,496,789.69

Total

₱66,424,875.53



Due to the adjustments of the above-mentioned errors/omissions, the reported total Assets, Liabilities and Net Asset/Equity at year-end amounting to ₱921,860,444.06, ₱13,413,474.67 and ₱908,446,969.39, respectively, were no longer affected.



Thus, the FSs present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position as of December 31, 2020 of NWRB, and its financial performance, cash flows, changes in net assets/equity, comparison of budget and actual amounts and notes to financial statements for the year then ended in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards.









B)	 Compliance with Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements



Fund utilization/obligation



1)	Overall, the agency’s fund utilization/obligation of ₱158.256 million is 89.85 percent compared to its appropriation/allotment of ₱176.135 million. Also, it registered a utilization rate of 84.51 percent for Water Resources Enforcement and Regulatory Program, which were in accordance with the purpose of appropriation/allotment. The non-utilization of allotment amounting ₱17.879 million was attributed to the two (2) failed biddings, and deferred hearings/workshops and travels in different regions due to travel restrictions imposed in 2020. Further, the validity of said unutilized allotment amounting to ₱15.333 is extended up to December 31, 2021 as allowed under National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 585 dated January 26, 2021.



Cash utilization/disbursement



2)	Of the total cash allocation of ₱156.928 million received during the year, only 75.49 percent or ₱118.470 million was utilized/disbursed with the balance of ₱38.459 million reverted to the National Treasury. Also, disbursements amounting to ₱48.399 million for Water Resources Enforcement and Regulatory Program were found to be regular, necessary and not excessive, extravagant and unconscionable. The non-utilization of cash was due to various procurements awarded only in the last quarter, late utility billings and delayed completion of infrastructure and assessment of water basin due to construction and travel restrictions.



Reversion of dormant cash, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary fund



3)	The agency has no dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds and related accounts for reversion as of year-end, in conformity with Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012, dated September 11, 2012, implementing Executive Order No. 431, dated May 30, 2005. All fees, charges, assessments, and other receipts or revenues collected, trust receipts and performance bonds and deposits, among others, except as authorized by law to be retained by the agency for use, were deposited/remitted to the National Treasury pursuant to Sections 4 to 14 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA (Receipts and Income).



Granting and liquidation of cash advances



4)	Cash advances during the year for payroll, operating expenses, official local and foreign travels amounting to ₱2.369 million and special purpose/time-bound undertakings of ₱2.301 million were granted and liquidated in accordance with COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. There were also no unliquidated cash advances in prior years.





Non-liquidation of fund transfers to implementing agencies

5)	The Board has no fund transfer in the current year. However, fund transfers to NGAs and GOCCs for implementation of projects in prior years amounting to ₱3.145 million and ₱1.352 million, respectively, remained unliquidated for more than 30 years, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013.



Section 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 states that within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Reports of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds.



Further, Section 5.4 of the same circular provides that “The Source Agency (SA) shall require the Implementing Agency (IA) to submit the reports and furnish the IA with a copy of the journal voucher (JV) taking up the expenditures. xxx.”



	During the year, NWRB has no fund transfer to NGAs and GOCCs for implementation of projects. However, analysis of the Due from NGAs and Due from GOCCs accounts as of December 31, 2020 revealed that prior year’s observation and recommendation on the existence of unliquidated fund transfers remained unimplemented, as there was no liquidation made during the year.

	

	Apart from the funds transferred to PCIEERD for research and development amounting to ₱13.986 million which are due for liquidation after the conduct of the research in CY 2021, fund transfers to various NGAs and GOCCs in prior years amounting to ₱3.145 million and ₱1.352, million respectively, or a total of ₱4.497 million were already past due but remained outstanding due to the failure of Management to enforce the submission of liquidation reports/documents by the IAs. Further, there were either incomplete records/documents or no record at all to support for fund transfers with total amount ₱0.171 million. The details of the unliquidated fund transfers are shown below.

	These outstanding fund transfers pertain but not limited to the establishment and operation of Hydrologic Stations, establishment of Ground Monitoring Wells and Implementation of National Hydrologic Data Program, which were implemented as early as 1977.



The aging and/or dormancy of the total amount of ₱0.171 million cannot be ascertained due to absence of documents to establish it. Likewise, claim on these receivables is doubtful in the absence of documents to support the same. It was recommended in the previous year to work out on the required documentations for request of authority to write-off, but to date, no request was received by the audit team.



The non-liquidation of the fund transfers is contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013. 



We recommended and Management agreed to:



	a)	promptly exert effort in locating the related records for those undocumented fund transfers. If prove futile, consider requesting for write-off of accounts; and



	b)	strictly observe the rules and regulations in the grant and liquidation of fund transfers as provided for in COA Circular No. 914.013 in future fund transfers.



Granting and liquidation of fund transfers to PS-DBM



6)	Fund transfers to Procurement Service – Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) for its common office supplies and equipment requirement during the year amounting to ₱3.380 million were granted and liquidated in accordance with COA Circular No. 94-013. There were also no unliquidated fund transfers in prior years.



Dormant receivables not requested for write-off



7)	Dormant receivable accounts amounting to ₱96.301 million were not requested for write-off, as required under Section 8.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 prescribes the guidelines and procedures in reconciling and cleaning the books of accounts of NGAs, LGUs, and GOCCs of dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers for fair presentation of accounts in the FSs.



Pertinent provisions of the said Circular are as follows:



Section 5.4 - Dormant Receivable Accounts are accounts which balances remained inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for 10 years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.



Section 5.9 - Write-off of Dormant Accounts is the process of derecognizing the asset account and the corresponding allowance for impairment from the books of accounts and transferring the same to the Registry of Accounts Written Off (RAWO). This does not mean condoning/extinguishing the obligation of the accountable officer/debtor.



Section 6.1 - All government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due and demandable and that cash advances and fund transfers are liquidated within the prescribed period depending upon their nature and purpose.



Audit disclosed that Loans and Receivable and Inter-Agency Receivables Accounts as of December 31, 2020 amounted to ₱906.384 million and ₱21.988 million, respectively. Analysis of the accounts disclosed that 10.37 per cent of the total balances amounting to ₱96.301 million were dormant and non-moving accounts for 10 years and more. Details are shown below.

It was noted that no request for authority to write-off dormant accounts was filed by Management. Interview with personnel revealed that these pertain to annual water charges and penalties due from various permittees, the collectability of the accounts could no longer be ascertained considering the lapse of time and the documents supporting the accounts were no longer available.



Inquiry further disclosed that no authority to write-off was requested due to lack or incompleteness of documentation to establish the receivables from each permittee.



The non-filing of request for write-off of receivable accounts is not in compliance with the above provisions of the above mentioned COA Circular. Hence, a need to file request for authority to write-off accounts.



We recommended and Management agreed to work out on the required documentations on the request for authority to write-off the dormant accounts and file said request, pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005.







Insurance of physical assets with GSIS



8)	The agency insured with the Government Service and Insurance System (GSIS) property amounting to ₱43.449 million with corresponding insurance premiums paid in the amount of ₱0.223 million, in accordance with RA No. 656, otherwise known as the “Property Insurance Law” as amended by PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973.



	Non-disposal of unserviceable property

	

9)	Unserviceable property with book value of ₱0.470 million remained not disposed of, contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 1445, thus, exposing them to further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value.



Section 79 of PD 1445 provides that, “When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsaleable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the Commission, advertising by printed notice in the Official Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of general circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the expense of publication, by notices posted for a like period in at least three public places in the locality where the property is to be sold. In the event that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned and approved by the Commission.”



The Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that unserviceable PPE with book value of ₱0.470 million, as shown in the following table, were not yet disposed of.

Inquiry disclosed that although the Disposal Committee (DC) had already been reconstituted, no disposal was made last year due to the retirement of its two members. In addition, the difficulty in undertaking the disposal procedures due to skeletal work force arrangement during the pandemic also hindered the agency from disposing the unserviceable property within the year.



Thus, the above- stated provision of Section 79 of PD 1445 was not complied with. Further, the non-disposal of unserviceable PPE exposes these items to further deterioration and deprived the government of potential income that could be generated from the sale thereof.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



				a)	assign new members to constitute the Disposal Committee and to adopt measures in the workplace to address the scheduling difficulties brought about by the pandemic; and



				b)	 instruct the DC to immediately dispose the unserviceable property.



Procurement of goods and services, consultancy services and infrastructure projects



10)	This year’s procurement of goods and services, consultancy services and infrastructure projects, through public bidding and agency to agency transfers, amounting to ₱15.170 million, ₱10.368 million and ₱21.761 million, respectively, were in accordance with Procurement Law (RA No. 9184).



Delayed/Non-submission of government contracts



11)	Copy of 93 government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents with corresponding amount of ₱28.325 million were not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from one to 154 days as of year-end, inconsistent with Items 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009. The 210 contracts, POs and supporting documents were verified to be complete and in order.



	Section 3.1.1. of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 provides that a copy of contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned within five (5) working days from the execution of the contract.



	Section 3.2.1 of the same Circular states that a copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and every supporting document, shall be submitted to the unit or agency Auditor concerned, within five (5) working days from issuance thereof.



The agency’s compliance with the above rules and regulations on the submission of contracts and purchase orders are summarized on the table below.

Contracts for infrastructure projects amounting to ₱21.761 million were submitted late with delays ranging from one to 29 days or not submitted at all. On the other hand, the POs were submitted with delays ranging from one to 71 days amounting to ₱6.564 million.

	

Interview with BAC personnel disclosed that delay and non-submission of contracts was due to internal misunderstanding between the BAC and the Accounting Division on who is in charge of forwarding the said contracts to the Audit Team. As for the Contracts of the COS individuals, delays in submission were due to pooling of the contracts together for bulk submission. In addition, the current pandemic also posed difficulty in meeting the required deadlines.



However, Management could still submit the contracts and POs electronically that is via email, if physical documents cannot be submitted due to the current pandemic situation in order to meet the timeline set by the above-cited regulations. Alternative mode is now allowed given the present condition. They can submit the original documents once the condition allows.



Thus, the non/delayed submission of the contracts hindered the timely evaluation of the contract’s compliance with the provisions of RA No. 9184 and its IRR, specifically on completeness of documentary requirements. Further, assessment that the contractual covenants are not disadvantageous to the government was also deterred.

	

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned officers/staff to:



	a)	identify the office responsible for the submission of the copy of contracts and POs together with its supporting documents, to ensure that the same are submitted to the audit team within five days from issuance as prescribed by law and applicable rules and regulations; and



	b)	consider the submission of the contracts and POs thru electronic means, if physical documents cannot be submitted due to the present situation.





Withholding and remittance of GSIS contributions, loans and employer’s share

12)	The GSIS personal share and loans of employees amounting to ₱4.093 million and ₱2.823 million, respectively, were deducted properly and remitted without delay, in accordance with RA No. 8291, the GSIS Act of 1997. Likewise, the employer’s share amounting to ₱ 1.399 million was remitted without delay.



Withholding and remittance of PhilHealth contributions



13)	The PhilHealth personal share of employees amounting to ₱0.620 million were deducted properly and remitted without delay, in accordance with RA No. 7875, as amended by RA No. 9241 (National Health Insurance Act of 1995). Likewise, the employer’s share amounting to ₱0.620 million was remitted without delay.



Withholding and remittance of Pag-IBIG contributions, loans and employer’s share



14)	The Pag-IBIG personal share and loans of employees amounting to ₱1.181 million and ₱0.589 million, respectively, were deducted properly and remitted without delay, in accordance with RA No. 7875, as amended by RA No. 9679 (Pag-IBIG Fund Law 2009). Likewise, the employer’s share amounting to ₱0.116 million was remitted without delay.



Withholding and remittance of taxes



15)	Taxes on the gross compensation income from officials and employees and government purchases and contract of services from suppliers/contractors amounting to ₱4.849 million and ₱2.528 million, respectively, were properly withheld and remitted without delay, in accordance with Revenue Regulation No. 10-2008 dated July 8, 2008.



Hiring of and payments to job orders, contractual and consultants



16)	During the year, 74 individuals covered with Contract of Service (COS) were hired on a semestral basis, in accordance with CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1 dated June 15, 2017, as updated by CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2, s. 2020, dated October 20, 2020, to augment the regular plantilla employees of 105. Their salaries were charged against Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) in the total amount of ₱13.504 million, as authorized under DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-5 dated July 22, 2013.



GAD Budget, Utilization and Accomplishments

17)	NWRB allocated only ₱0.946 million for its Gender and Development (GAD) budget representing 0.61 percent instead of at least five (5%) of the agency’s total appropriation of ₱156.009 million, of which only ₱0.692 million was actually expended.

	

	Pertinent laws, rules and regulations with regard to Gender and Development are the following:

	

	a)	All agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta for Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).----footnote1----



	b)	The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.----footnote2----



	c)	At least five percent (5%) of the total agency budget appropriations authorized under the annual General Appropriations Act (GAA) shall correspond to activities supporting GAD plans and programs. The GAD budget shall be drawn from the Agency’s maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOE), capital outlay (CO), and personal services (PS). It is understood that the GAD budget does not constitute an additional budget over an agency’s total budget appropriations.----footnote3----



	d)	All agencies, offices, bureaus and other government instrumentalities and others concerned shall formulate their annual GAD Plan and Budgets (GPBs) within the context of their mandates.----footnote4----



	e)	The GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) of the agency shall review all submitted GPBs and as needed, provide comments and recommendations for revision. The GFPS shall then submit the final GPBs and the corresponding GAD Accomplishment Report to the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) for review and endorsement to Department of Budget and Management (DBM).----footnote5----



Verification showed that the budget allocated for CY 2020 amounted to only ₱0.946 million for nine GAD activities or 0.61% instead of at least 5% of the total budget of NWRB as required. Further, out of these nine activities, two were not accomplished. Total expenses for the implemented activities totaled ₱0.692 million including attribution costs. Details are shown below:

Despite previous years’ audit recommendation, the agency was not able to fully comply with the required allocation of five percent of its budget for the implementation of GAD related projects and activities mainstreamed with its regular programs/projects/activities. Further, although personnel were hired for collecting disaggregated data and maintaining the database, no data was collected for the year.



Management justified that they find difficulty in attributing their Agency’s programs and activities to GAD expenditures since most of their projects and activities are to be done by male employees considering its nature, which requires technical expertise and also risky field works.



Thus, the objectives of said provision of law, which were to address gender and equality issues and promote women empowerment, were not fully achieved.



We recommended and Management agreed to devise strategies to attribute at least five per cent of the total annual budget for the GAD-related activities and expenditures and ensure that GAD related programs and projects are implemented in accordance with PCW priority agendas and targets.



Senior Citizen and Person with Disability plans/programs



18)	The agency spent ₱0.209 million in the implementation of the activities for the Senior Citizen and Person with Disability (SCPD), in compliance with Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020.



Receipt and utilization of Disaster Related Fund



19)	The agency did not receive any Disaster Risk Reduction Management (DRRM) Fund and/or Quick Response Fund (QRF) for this year and in prior years.



Implementation of ODA Funded Projects



20)	The agency did not receive and disburse Official Development Assistance (ODA) Fund during the year.



Receipt and disbursement of PDAF and DAP Fund



21)	The agency did not receive and disburse Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) and Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) fund for this year and prior years, in compliance with Supreme Court Decisions G.R. Nos. 208566 and 209287, respectively.



Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges

22)	No audit suspension, disallowances and charges were issued and settled during the year. Likewise, there were no unsettled audit suspensions, disallowances and charges in the prior years.



Audit of Covid 19 related expenses



23)	The agency has refocused funds from regular funds for Salaries and Wages and Travelling Expenses for the agency’s Covid Pandemic response. Of the total refocused funds amounting to ₱0.744 million, ₱0.744 million or 100.00 percent were utilized/obligated in accordance with the purpose of the appropriation/allotment and disbursed, in accordance with Section 2 of PD 1445. Likewise, the 2020 Annual Procurement Plan (APP) for common-use supplies was revised/amended to include the covid related supplies.
