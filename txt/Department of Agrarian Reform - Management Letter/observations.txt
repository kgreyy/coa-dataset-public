Dear Secretary Castriciones: 



Consolidated Management Letter on the Audit of the

Department of Agrarian Reform 

for the period January 1 to December 31, 2020





I)	INTRODUCTION



1)	Pursuant to Section 2, Article IX-D of the Constitution of the Philippines and Section 43 of the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines or Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, we have conducted the financial audit with compliance with other legal and regulatory requirements on the accounts and transactions of the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) Central Office (CO), four ongoing Foreign-Assisted Projects (FAPs), 15 Regional Offices (ROs) and 75 Provincial Offices (POs) for the period ended December 31, 2020. However, the complete results of the financial audit cannot be incorporated in this report in view of the non-submission of Combined Financial Statements for CY 2020 and its integral parts where an audit opinion could be rendered. The audit was conducted in accordance with the International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain a reasonable basis for our conclusions.



2)		The audit was conducted to: (a) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (b) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (c) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations. The examination on the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements was not fully undertaken due to the non-availability of the Combined Financial Statements.



3)	We wish to bring to your attention the consolidated audit observations and recommendations of the Audit Teams of the DARCO, four FAPs, 13 DARROs and 67 DARPOs which were earlier communicated through their respective Management Letters and discussed with the concerned DAR officials and employees during the virtual exit conference held on June 23, 2021. Management’s comments were incorporated therein, where appropriate.



4)	This Consolidated Management Letter is issued in lieu of the Consolidated Annual Audit Report.





II)	BACKGROUND INFORMATION



Mandate/Functions/Jurisdictions



5)	The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) was created by virtue of Republic Act (RA) No. 3844 dated August 8, 1963.  Executive Order (EO) No. 364 dated September 27, 2004 made DAR responsible for all land reforms in the country, which included agrarian, urban and ancestral domain land reforms.



6)	DAR is the lead implementing agency of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) through Land Tenure Improvement (LTI), Agrarian Justice and coordinated delivery of essential Support Services to client beneficiaries. It has the following functions:



--	To provide land tenure security to landless farmers through land acquisition and distribution, leasehold arrangements’ implementation and other LTI services;



--	To provide legal intervention to Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries (ARBs) through adjudication of agrarian cases and agrarian legal assistance; and



--	To implement, facilitate and coordinate the delivery of support services to ARBs through Social Infrastructure and Local Capability Building (SILCAB); Sustainable Agribusiness and Rural Enterprise Development (SARED); and Access Facilitation and Enhancement Services (AFAES).



Organizational Structure and Personnel Complement



7)	The DAR is headed by Secretary John R. Castriciones, assisted by seven Undersecretaries and six Assistant Secretaries. DAR is composed of a Central Office (CO), 15 regional offices (ROs) headed by Regional Directors (RDs) and 75 provincial offices headed by Provincial Agrarian Reform Program Officers (PARPOs), excluding Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) and its five provinces.



8)	Of the total 9,352 authorized itemized permanent positions under the Personal Itemization and Plantilla of Personnel approved by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), 7,660 were filled up as of December 31, 2020. Its manpower complement totaled 10,554 consisting of 7,660 permanent employees, 700 co-terminus with the incumbent and 2,194 individuals hired under Job Order (JO) and Contract of Service (COS).



Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 



Financial Audit



9)	The Agency failed to submit its Combined Trial Balances, Financial Statements (FSs) and Supporting Schedules for the Year Ended December 31, 2020, as required under Section 41 of PD No. 1445 and Section 60 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus, prevented the auditor to express an audit opinion on the FSs of the Agency. Likewise, the objectives of general-purpose financial reporting in the public sector, which is to provide information useful for decision making was not achieved. (Paragraph No. 28)



10)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Financial and Management Service to:



a)	sincerely commit for the immediate submission of combined financial statements as prescribed in order to prevent further delays in the finalization of CY 2020 DAR AAR and IAR and to preclude the imposition of penal sanctions as provided in Section 41 (3) of PD No. 1445 in case of failure of the concerned officials/personnel to comply thereto; and



b)	resolve the delays incurred in the submission of financial reports and provide measures instigated to prevent recurring delays in the preparation thereof, henceforth, observe the reglementary period in the submission for the succeeding accounting period in compliance with the timelines prescribed.



Compliance with Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements



11)		Fund transfers to IAs and NGOs/POs during the year for the implementation of agency’s projects amounting to ₱103.193 million or 86.00 percent, of the funds transferred were not liquidated. Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years amounting to ₱1,635.836 million or 71.52 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱2,287.326 million. (Paragraph No. 61)



12)		We recommended and Management agreed to direct the concerned DAR offices to:



a)	refrain from granting additional fund transfer if the previous transfers were not yet liquidated;



b)	continue to monitor and enforce the liquidation of fund transfers in accordance with COA Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2007-001 by making proper coordination with the IAs and NGOs/POs concerned requiring them to immediately submit the reports on the utilization of funds with complete supporting documents and return any unexpended/unutilized funds for completed projects, if any;



c)	enforce the provisions of the MOA strictly in accordance with the timelines that should be provided in the agreement; and



d)	validate status of project implementation by various IAs and identify all completed projects which are already due for liquidation, thereafter, send demand letters to enforce submission of liquidation documents and/or refund of excess amount, otherwise, execute sanctions stipulated in the MOA for non-compliance, as the case maybe.



13)		Fund transfers of DARRO XI to PS-DBM for its office supplies and equipment requirement amounting to ₱0.166 million were granted and liquidated during the year. There were also unliquidated fund transfers in prior years of ₱17.336 million that were fully liquidated during the year. However, the amount of ₱29.534 million or 85.55 percent of the funds transferred in 11 DAR offices were not liquidated. Also, ₱791.758 million or 91.91 percent of prior year’s balance of fund transfers of ₱861.464 million were still unliquidated. (Paragraph No. 71)



14)		We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountants and Property Officers of:



a)	11 DAR offices to intensively exert efforts to coordinate and follow-up from PS-DBM, on the status of the procurement and delivery of common-use office supplies/materials, farm machinery and equipment and the refund of any remaining funds for similar transactions; and issue supplemental Agency Procurement Request (APR) to PS-DBM to replace all unavailable stocks with another common-use supplies to fully utilize the previous transfer; and



b)	DARROs II and IVA to confirm the status of undelivered farm machineries and equipment, thereafter, arrange for the return/refund of the fund transfer for proper disposition, as the case maybe.



15)		Dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances and fund transfers amounting to ₱1,596.300 million were not requested for write-off by DARCO, DARRO VII and 12 DARPOs. (Paragraph No. 81)



16)		We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountants of concerned offices to:



a)	regularly monitor the settlement of receivables and liquidation of cash advances and fund transfers; and



b)	request for the write-off of dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances and unliquidated fund transfers following the guidelines provided under COA Circular No. 2016-005.



17)		DARCO, two DAR FAPs, seven DARROs and 44 DARPOs insured against fire or theft with the GIF of the GSIS property amounting to ₱645.137 million with corresponding insurance premiums paid in the amount of ₱3.337 million. However, physical assets amounting to ₱328.317 million were not insured, hence, the agency is at risk of not being indemnified in case of damage to or loss of property. (Paragraph No. 87)



18)		We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	instigate measures to address the adverse effects of pandemic that prevented the concerned offices to prioritize the coordination with the GIF of the GSIS for all the insurable property of the agency, pursuant to the Property Insurance Law;



b)	maximize fund utilization of allotted budget for Insurance Expense to avoid lapsing thereof at year-end; and



c)	direct the Budget Officer to coordinate with the Property Officer for the inclusion of annual budget to cover for the insurance of all insurable assets of the office.



19)		SPLIT and MinSAAD ODA-funded projects, with total project cost of ₱29,027.672 million were not implemented in accordance with the period of implementation, thus, were delayed and resulted in the incurrence of commitment fees amounting to ₱11.533 million. (Paragraph No. 161)



20)		We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Project Heads of:



a)	SPLIT to coordinate with (i) DOF, NEDA and DBM on the current predicament in the start-up project implementation as a result of the delayed release of fund and resolve any adverse effects leading to the delayed project implementation; and (ii) BTr on the reasonableness of charging commitment fee considering that delay is due to the non-release of project fund during the year; and



b)	MinSAAD to ensure efficient fund utilization by considering readiness and ability to implement the project before submitting project design/proposal.



21)		NSs, NDs and NCs were issued for transactions audited during the year amounting to ₱64.126 million due to non-compliance with various laws, rules and regulations. Moreover, only the amount of ₱60.847 million was settled with corresponding NSSDCs issued during the year, leaving unsettled suspensions, disallowances and charges amounting to ₱5,116.085 as of the end of the year. (Paragraph No. 174)





22)		We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	adhere to (i) laws, rules and regulations in the disbursement of funds to prevent incurrence of audit suspensions, disallowances and charges; (ii) the provisions of RRSA under COA Circular 2009-006 by requiring the settlement of suspensions, disallowances, and charges within the prescribed period to prevent accumulation of unsettled NS, ND and NC; and (iii) Sections 3 and 9 of COA Resolution No. 2017-021 by requesting authority from COA PLO, LSS to settle audit disallowances with finality by installment;



b)	strengthen its controls on the monitoring of status of compliance and settlement of NSs/NDs/NCs by ensuring that concerned responsible and liable persons are duly acquainted with their duty to fully settle suspended/disallowed accounts within the reglementary period to preclude the issuance of finality of decision; and



c)	ensure to submit request for authority to warrant the instalment settlement of disallowances given that full settlement is not really feasible during this time.



23)		The DARCO allocated/attributed budget of ₱91.575 million for the implementation of programs and activities in support of the NTF-ELCAC project cannot be properly evaluated due to absence of relevant documents/incomplete information affecting the appropriateness and accuracy of the reports submitted.  Moreover, of the total attribution of ₱91.575 million, only ₱40.001 million or 43.68 percent was obligated and not in accordance with the original purpose of the attribution. (Paragraph No. 183)



24)		We recommended and Management agreed to cause the full utilization of funds and timely implementation of planned program, projects and activities in accordance with the original purpose it was intended and to submit immediately the following to the Audit Team:

	

a)		basis for the attributed amount for each office/region;

b)		rationale and/or authority to modify the attributed ELCAC funds to ARBold project;

c)		work and financial plan with performance indicators and targets for ARBold project;

d)		basis for the amount downloaded for ARBold project to different FOUs; and

e)		information as to whom and how much was disbursed out of the obligations incurred.



25)	The consolidated observations and recommendations were discussed with concerned officials during the virtual exit conference conducted on June 23, 2021. Their comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate.





Enforcement of Settlement of Accounts



26)	Out of the ₱5,176.932 million suspensions, disallowances and charges for CY 2020 and prior years, ₱60.847 million or 1.18 percent was settled leaving a balance of ₱5,116.085 million.



Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations



27)	Of the 49 audit recommendations embodied in the prior year’s Annual Audit Report, 24 were implemented and 25 were not implemented as of December 31, 2020, of which 21 were reiterated in this report, where applicable.





III)	OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



A)	Financial Audit



Non-submission of Financial Statements



28)	The Agency failed to submit its Combined Trial Balances, Financial Statements (FSs) and Supporting Schedules for the Year Ended December 31, 2020, as required under Section 41 of PD No. 1445 and Section 60 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus, prevented the auditor to express an audit opinion on the FSs of the Agency. Likewise, the objectives of general-purpose financial reporting in the public sector, which is to provide information useful for decision making was not achieved.



29)	Section 41 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides the following:



Xxx



(2) To carry out the purposes of this section, the chief accountant or the official in charge or keeping the accounts of a government agency shall submit to the Commission year-end trial balances and such other supporting or subsidiary statements as may be required by the Commission not later than the fourteenth day of February. Trial balances returned by the Commission for revision due to non-compliance with accounting rules and regulations, shall be resubmitted within three days after the date of receipt by the official concerned.



(3) Failure on the part of any official or employee to comply with the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph shall cause the automatic suspension of the payment of his salary and other emoluments until he shall have complied therewith. The violation of these provisions for at least three times shall subject the offender to administrative disciplinary action.

	

30)	Pertinent provisions under Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I provide the following:



Section 3. Purpose of Financial Statements. It states that:



	a)	“Financial statements are a structured representation of the financial position and financial performance of an entity. The objectives of general purpose financial statements are to provide information about the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making and evaluating decisions about the allocation of resources. Specifically, the objectives of general purpose financial reporting in the public sector should be to provide information useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the accountability of the entity for the resources entrusted to it, xxx”



Section 5. Components of Financial Statements. It states that:



“A complete set of financial statements (condensed and by fund cluster) to be submitted by an entity shall include the following: 

a. Statement of Financial Position (SFP) (Annex A); 

b. Statement of Financial Performance (SFPer) (Annex B); 

c. Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity (SCNA/E) (Annex C); 

d. Statement of Cash Flows (SCF) (Annex D); 

e. Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amount (SCBAA) (Annex E); and 

f. Notes (Annex F), comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes. (Par. 21, IPSAS 1).” 



Section 60 sets the deadlines on submission of these financial statements. It provides that “All NGAs shall prepare and submit the following financial statements and schedules xxx, within the prescribed deadline”.



Particularly quoted below is the responsibility and deadline pertaining to the year-end reports:



Entity/Office

Statement/Report

Branch Offices

Main Offices

Year-end TBs, FSs, SSs (Combined CO, ROs and OUs)

COA Auditor, DBM, COA-GAS



31)	Among the standards to achieve fair presentation and reliable information of the financial statements is timeliness in the preparation and submission of reports. All needed reports should therefore be produced promptly to be of maximum usefulness.



32)	Management explained that delay was mainly attributed to the immediate lockdown of Accounting Office for a period of time due to the increasing COVID 19 cases thereby forcing the Accounting personnel to work from home for which outputs were limited since documents were mostly at the office. Nevertheless, complete set of FS and FARs will be submitted the soonest possible time.



33)	In the Audit Engagement Letter presented during the Entrance Conference and attended by various DAR concerned officials and personnel conducted on November 23, 2020, the CY 2020 Annual Audit Report (AAR) for DAR and the issuance of Independent Audit Report (IAR) on the CY 2020 FSs is due on June 30, 2021. Prior to finalization, the draft AAR and reviewed combined FSs shall be submitted to COA for review on May 25, 2021, hence, the Audit Team highly emphasized the submission of FSs on time to generate an audit result that is relevant and timely. However, no combined FSs were submitted as of date despite the lapse of four months.



34)	We understand that the unprecedented adverse effects of COVID 19 have caused the intermittent working schedule of DAR which is of valid consideration, yet, the continuous delay in submission for over months already is taking a toll on the efficiency and timeliness of audit, conceiving doubt on the fairness and reliability of financial information.



35)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Financial and Management Service to:



c)	sincerely commit for the immediate submission of combined financial statements as prescribed in order to prevent further delays in the finalization of CY 2020 DAR AAR and IAR and to preclude the imposition of penal sanctions as provided in Section 41 (3) of PD No. 1445 in case of failure of the concerned officials/personnel to comply thereto; and



d)	resolve the delays incurred in the submission of financial reports and provide measures instigated to prevent recurring delays in the preparation thereof, henceforth, observe the reglementary period in the submission for the succeeding accounting period in compliance with the timelines prescribed.













B)	Compliance with Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements



Fund utilization/obligation 



36)		Overall, the agency’s fund utilization/obligation of ₱7,146.594 million is 92.44 percent compared to its allotment of ₱7,731.471 million, leaving a balance of ₱584.879 million mainly due to restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic which significantly reduced the personnel mobility and use of resources in compliance with strict health protocols. Nevertheless, the implementation of Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Development and Sustainability Program (ARBDSP)-Climate Resilient Farm Productivity Support Program (CRFPSP) registered a fund utilization of ₱279.498 million or 94.22 percent of its available allotment of ₱296.658 million which were in accordance with the purpose of appropriation/allotment.

	

	



37)		To facilitate various government agencies’ fulfillment of its mandate, the National Budget for Fiscal year (FY 2020) was approved through the Republic Act (RA) No. 11465, also known as the General Appropriations Act (GAA) FY 2020, which states in its General Provisions the following (Section 60):



--	   All appropriations authorized in this Act, shall be available for release and disbursement for the purpose specified and under the same general and special provisions applicable thereto, until December 31, 2020. While the amount appropriated herein as financial assistance to LGUs released during the fiscal year shall be available for disbursement for the purpose specified until December 31, 2021;



--	   After the end of validity period, all unreleased appropriations shall lapse, while unexpended/undisbursed funds shall revert to the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund and shall not thereafter be available for expenditure except by subsequent legislative enactment. Departments, bureaus, and offices of the National Government shall strictly observe the validity of appropriations and the reversion of funds; and



--	   For FY 2020, the appropriations for infrastructure capital outlays, including those subsidy releases to GOCCs for infrastructure projects shall be valid for obligation until December 31, 2020, while the completion of construction, inspection, and payment shall be made not later than December 31, 2021. On the other hand, appropriations for MOOE and other capital outlays item shall likewise be valid for obligation until December 31, 2020, while the delivery, inspection and payment shall be made not later than June 30, 2021.



38)		For FY 2020, allotment amounting to ₱7,731.471 million was received by DAR in the fulfillment of its mandate as the government agency responsible to implement the CARP through land tenure improvement, agrarian justice and coordinated delivery of essential support services to client-beneficiaries with the objective of alleviating poverty by increasing productivity and income of agrarian reform beneficiaries.

*Data sourced from individual MLs for CY 2020 of DARCO, FAPs, DARROs and DARPOs 



39)		The unobligated allotment is mainly attributed to restrictions imposed during the COVID 19 pandemic, such as limited personnel mobility and alternative work arrangements, delayed downloading of funds from COs/ROs to OUs thereby delaying the conduct of procurement activities, constricted use of supplies, decreased use of motor vehicles and consumption of fuel/gas, suspended/limited trainings and workshops, hiring of FAPs consultants not pursued/realized in compliance with strict health protocols in the target sites/areas.



40)		Likewise, low fund utilization for FAPs Italian Agrarian Reform Community Development Service Program (IARCDSP) is due to the zero utilization of programmed expenditures in CY 2020 amounting to ₱78.829 million intended for Agriculture and Marine Supplies Expense, Office Supplies Expense and Other General Services. The PMO explained that the primary reason for the delay in project implementation even after the extension by the NEDA ICC-Cabcom until December 31, 2020 was the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in delay in the issuance of No Objection Declaration (NOD) from Rome, Italy. There were also suspensions of work activities on the ground like the construction, training, monitoring and other operations.



41)		Management commented that the unutilized/unobligated allotments/funds was a result of unprecedented adverse effects of the pandemic hampered the flow of regular office operations limiting mass gatherings as well as prohibiting all face to face activities which affected the corresponding budget allotted for the activities. In           addition, the delayed downloading of funds from DAR Central Office to the field offices placed predicament to fast track and beat the procurement process in order to fully implement the project/program and obligate the funds considering time constraint.  



42)		We recognize that under RA No. 11520, which amended Section 60 of the General Provisions of FY 2020 GAA, the availability of FY 2020 appropriations was extended up to December 31, 2021. However, with the Project’s current rate of utilization, it becomes uncertain if management will be able to utilize its remaining appropriations considering that new appropriations were again provided to the project under the FY 2021 GAA which also need to be utilized by the end of 2021.



43)		Nevertheless, allotment intended for CRFPSP, one of the components of the ARBDSP intended to provide agri-technology and extension with farm inputs, farm machinery and equipment, amounting to ₱296.658 million was 94.22 percent utilized covering major crop-based block farm which primarily include rice and corn and sustainable livelihood support for disaster affected areas during the year as follows:

44)		We recommended and Management agreed to: 



	a)	identify the affected program/project/activities and provide catch-up plan to resolve any adverse effects of unutilized fund considering the implementation of cash budgeting system and validity period of allotment; and



	b)	ensure that DARCO/ROs and OUs are closely coordinated for the timely release of funds to avoid delays in the implementation of activities and ensure full utilization of funds.



Cash utilization/disbursement 



45)		Of the total cash allocation of ₱4,777.118 million received during the year, ₱4,562.758 million or 95.51 percent was utilized/disbursed, leaving a balance of ₱214.360 million that was reverted to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) due to delayed transfer of cash allocations and delayed implementation of activities and not pursued projects in CY 2020 brought about by the imposed restrictions on movements due to COVID 19 pandemic, which was beyond the control of Management.



Non-reversion of dormant cash, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary fund



46)		Dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds as of year-end, including trust receipts and performance bonds during the year, except as authorized by law to be retained by the agency for its use, amounting to ₱17.382 million, were not reverted/deposited by 11 DAR offices to the National Treasury.



47)		Executive Order No. 431 dated May 30, 2005 was issued directing the reversion of all dormant accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds to the general fund. It further emphasized a constitutional provision that once the purpose for which a special fund was created has been fulfilled or abandoned, the balance shall be transferred to the general funds of the government. Thus, the DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No.4-2012 dated September 11, 2012 was issued to implement EO No. 431, and required the immediate closure of unauthorized accounts and the evaluation of the necessity of maintaining dormant and unnecessary accounts.



48)		However, 11 DAR offices did not revert dormant cash, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary funds amounting to ₱17.382 million, contrary to the above-mentioned regulations, with details as follows:

49)		The non-remittance of dormant and unexpended cash in bank balances to the National Treasury deprived the government of the much needed funds to finance other priority programs and projects.



50)		We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountants of:



a)	concerned DAR offices to revert the dormant/unauthorized and unnecessary cash accounts to the National Treasury, thereafter, closure of the said accounts shall be carried out, as the case maybe;



b)	DARRO VIII to coordinate with the DAR CO for the proper and immediate disposition of cash balance sourced from ARISP III and ARCP II considering that these have been dormant for the past five years already;



c)	DARPO Bohol to reconcile the list of DAR employees with COA disallowances and payments thereof for purposes of lifting the disallowances of the concerned employees and remit the same to the National Treasury; and



d)	DARRO VII to verify the trust liabilities and determine whether the purposes of which were already completed, terminated or still on going. Likewise, inform the individuals who posted performance bonds if they are still interested in claiming them, otherwise revert them to the National Treasury.



Granting and liquidation of cash advances 



51)		Cash advances granted during the year for operating expenses, official, local and foreign travels and special purpose/time-bound undertakings in 39 DAR offices amounting to ₱62.472 million were liquidated, except for DAR CO, two DARROs and eight DARPOs amounting to ₱1.139 million or  13.56 percent of the cash advances granted during the year of ₱8.397 million were not liquidated at the end of the year. Also, there were still unliquidated cash advances in prior years amounting to ₱0.666 million or 35.73 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱1.864 million.



52)		COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides the guidelines on the granting and liquidation of cash advances, as follows:



Section 4.1 – A cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served.



Section 5.1.1 – Salaries, Wages, etc. shall be liquidated within five (5) days after each fifteen (15) day/end of the month pay period.



Section 5.1.3 – Cash advances for travel shall be liquidated by the official/employee concerned strictly within sixty (60) days after return to the Philippines in the case of foreign travel or within thirty (30) days after his return to his official station in the case of local travel, as provided for in Executive Order No. 248, as amended by Executive Order No. 298, otherwise, payment of his salary shall be suspended until he complies therewith.  It further provides that the Accountant shall monitor the liquidation of each cash advance and send written reminder within ten (10) days before the thirty or sixty days period, enjoining the concerned official or employee to liquidate his travel cash advance.



Section 5.8 – All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year. Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipt.



53)		Moreover, Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code states in unequivocal terms that the failure of a public officer to have duly forthcoming any public funds or property with which he is chargeable, upon demand by any duly authorized officer, shall be prima facie evidence that he has put such missing funds or property to personal use.



54)		COA Circular No. 92-391 dated November 25, 1992 also requires the settlement and clearance from Accountabilities of Government Officials and Employees prior to their transfer or acceptance of their resignation.



55)		During the year, 39 DAR offices reported full liquidation of their cash advances amounting to ₱62.472 million, except, however for DARCO, two DARROs, eight DARPOs and one FAPs PMO with unliquidated cash advances as of year-end amounting to ₱1.139 million out of the ₱8.397 million granted to them, to wit:

56)		The unliquidated advances were the result of management’s laxity in monitoring and enforcing the liquidation within the prescribed period.



57)		Likewise, the following offices reported an unliquidated prior year’s balance amounting to ₱0.666 million:

Of the unliquidated balance, ₱0.384 million were outstanding for more than five years, of which two employees with unliquidated cash advance intended for official foreign travels granted in CYs 2002 and 2005 amounting to ₱0.083 million, were no longer connected with the agency since CYs 2007 and 2009. No liquidations or reimbursements was made for the said advances, which is outstanding for almost 18 years. For the retired employee, failure to settle cash advances is a clear violation of COA Circular No. 92-391.

Identification and analysis of cash advances disposition were already undertaken, henceforth, request for write-off will be submitted on the basis of demand letters sent and latest account status. As of report date, these long overdue accounts are still outstanding as of December 31, 2020 pending request for write-off. The request for write-off and pertinent documents on the dormant unliquidated cash advances was eventually submitted to COA last May 2021, for review/ evaluation of the Resident Auditor.



Nevertheless, Management adopted new guidelines on granting cash advances thru reimbursement basis pertaining to travel, and only grants cash advances on exceptional circumstances.

58)		The accumulation of unliquidated cash advances in the hands of AOs exposes government funds to the risk of possible losses thru misuse. 



59)		DARCO management commented that it is strictly implementing the “no prior settlement of cash advance, no additional grant” policy, hence, will conduct thorough scrutiny on the pending unliquidated cash advance during the year. Further, the Accounting Division was instructed to monitor closely the liquidation of all prior year outstanding cash advances granted to several officials and employees including those who are no longer in the service by sending letters/ memos to concerned officials/employees to enforce settlement. Furthermore, a memorandum signed by OIC-Undersecretary for Finance, Management and Administrative Office (FMAO) reiterating the guidelines on the granting and holding of cash advances and prepayments to all officials and employees was issued.



60)		We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountants of:



a)	DARCO, two DARROs, eight DARPOs and one FAPs PMO to enact measures to enforce immediate liquidation of outstanding cash advances, such as, effecting deduction from salaries/benefits of concerned personnel; thereafter, strictly enforce the prescribed period of liquidation and require the immediate refund/return of any excess amount thereon;

	

b)	DARCO to continue to exert extra effort to locate the separated/resigned employees and collect their outstanding cash advances and adhere strictly to the provisions of Memorandum Circular No. 155 of the Office of the President as stated in COA Circular No. 92-931; and



c)	Davao de Oro PMO to observe liquidation of cash advances within the prescribed period, and discontinue the grant of subsequent cash advances with outstanding cash advance.





Non-liquidation of fund transfers to implementing agencies and NGOs/POs 



61)		Fund transfers to IAs and Non-Government Organizations/People’s Organization (NGOs/POs) during the year for the implementation of agency’s projects amounting to ₱103.193 million or 86.00 percent, of the funds transferred were not liquidated. Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years amounting to ₱1,635.836 million or 71.52 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱2,287.326 million.



62)		Section 4.6 of the COA Circular No. 94-103 dated December 13, 1994 provides that within ten days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the Implementing Agency (IA) shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds



63)		Further, Section 5.4 thereof provides that the Source Agency shall require the Implementing Agency to submit the said reports for recording purposes.



64)		Section 5.4 of COA Circular No. 2007-001 provides also that within sixty (60) days after completion of the project, the NGO/PO shall submit the final Fund Utilization Report certified by its Accountant and approved by its President/Chairman to the GO, together with the inspection report and certificate of project completion rendered/issued by the GO authorized representative, list of beneficiaries with their acceptance/acknowledgment of the projects/funds/goods/services received. xxx. These documents shall support the liquidation of funds granted to the NGO/PO.



65)		The summary of the unliquidated fund transfers to IAs and NGOs/POs covering all funds as of December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱1,739.029 million which consist of unliquidated balance from fund transfers during the year and prior years amounting to ₱103.193 million and ₱1,635.836 million, respectively are as follows:

66)		The nature of some of the unliquidated fund transfers are as follows:



Account

Remarks 

Due from LGUs

DARPO Albay - pertains to the unutilized funds for completed projects of LGU Libon and LGU Jovellar. 



DARPO Cebu - pertains to fund transfers on projects under Grassroots Participatory Budgeting and/or Bottom-up Budgeting amounting to ₱1.000 million, which remained unliquidated for more than five years.  Moreso, not a single liquidation was made since its grant, this despite the fact that project implementations, as provided in the guidelines, should have been completed/concluded in CY 2016. Further, fund transfers pertaining to these projects were released even without liquidation of prior releases.

Due from NGOs/ POs

DARPO Pampanga - pertains to fund transferred on October 28, 1996 for Candaba Swamp Institutional Development Program. 



DARPO Eastern Samar - comprises of the balance of loan granted to the Diocese of Borongan released directly from DAR CO, 18 years ago, amounting to ₱0.646 million and loan in the amount of ₱0.821 million granted to Sajulpag Coconut Farmers MPCI for the Sustainable Agricultural Production and Diversification Project and unidentified balance of ₱0.463 million due to lack of records.



67)		The non-liquidation of fund transfers were attributed to the (a) grant of fund transfers despite non-liquidation of the previous transfer; (b) lack of project monitoring;          (c) delayed implementation and completion of projects; and (d) provisions in the MOA not strictly enforced.



68)		During the exit conference, the Audit Team was informed by Management that demand letters were already sent to the concerned IAs and NGOs/POs and DARCO Accounting Division was specifically instructed to: (a) monitor closely the liquidation of all outstanding fund transfers to IAs and NGOs/POs; and (b) discuss the discrepancies and facilitate the submission of liquidation reports with the concerned IAs and NGOs/POs.



69)		As for the unliquidated fund transfers to various IAs on the implementation of FAPs Mindanao Sustainable Agrarian and Agriculture Development Project (MinSAAD), the following comments were provided by Management:



--	The DAR FAPs CO is continuously coordinating with the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and National Irrigation Administration (NIA) to expedite submission of report. Follow-up letter dated February 9, 2021 was issued to the DPWH Project Director to demand liquidation of outstanding fund transfer.



--	The Accountant of Sultan Kudarat PMO, together with the Project Coordinators, had been thoroughly reminding the IAs to submit liquidations. Demand letters were already sent for those who are not compliant. 



70)		We recommended and Management agreed to direct the concerned DAR offices to: 



a)	refrain from granting additional fund transfer if the previous transfers were not yet liquidated;



b)	continue to monitor and enforce the liquidation of fund transfers in accordance with COA Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2007-001 by making proper coordination with the IAs and NGOs/POs concerned requiring them to immediately submit the reports on the utilization of funds with complete supporting documents and return any unexpended/unutilized funds for completed projects, if any; 



c)	enforce the provisions of the MOA strictly in accordance with the timelines that should be provided in the agreement; and



d)	validate status of project implementation by various IAs and identify all completed projects which are already due for liquidation, thereafter, send demand letters to enforce submission of liquidation documents and/or refund of excess amount, otherwise, execute sanctions stipulated in the MOA for non-compliance, as the case maybe.  



Non-liquidation of fund transfers to PS-DBM 



71)		Fund transfers of DARRO XI to PS-DBM for its office supplies and equipment requirement amounting to ₱0.166 million were granted and liquidated during the year. There were also unliquidated fund transfers in prior years of ₱17.336 million that were fully liquidated during the year. However, the amount of ₱29.534 million or 85.55 percent of the funds transferred in 11 DAR offices were not liquidated. Also, ₱791.758 million or 91.91 percent of prior year’s balance of fund transfers of ₱861.464 million were still unliquidated.



72)		Section 21 of the General Appropriations for FY 2019 provides that “All agencies   of the government shall purchase common-use supplies from the Procurement Service (PS) as mandated under LOI No 755 dated October 18, 1978, EO. 359, s.1989, AO No. 17, s. 2011 and such other guidelines issued thereon. Common use supplies shall refer to those included in the Electronic Catalogue of the PS and those which shall be regularly updated to include all items commonly procured by the agencies of the government.”



73)		DARRO XI fund transfers to PS-DBM for common office supplies and equipment requirement during the year amounting to ₱0.166 million were granted and liquidated. There were also ₱17.336 million unliquidated fund transfers in prior years that were fully liquidated during the year.



74)		Unliquidated fund transfers made by 11 DAR offices to PS-DBM amounting to ₱821.292 million consist of unliquidated balance during the year and prior years amounting to ₱29.534 million and ₱791.758 million, respectively, are as follows:

75)		In DARPO Batangas, the non-liquidation includes purchase of office supplies which were out of stock at the time of pick-up. While in DARROs II and IVA, the balance pertains to the procured farm machinery and equipment since CY 2014.



76)		The unliquidated balance in DARRO II represents Check No. 1915083 dated December 16, 2014 amounting to ₱8.536 million which consists of one unit Combine Harvester, one unit Mechanical Transplanter bundled with one unit Seed Conveyor and one unit Seed Tray (4,000 pieces capacity), four units Shredder and one unit six-wheeler Heavy Duty Dump Truck, yet, no delivery was made despite the lapse of almost six years. Demand letter dated July 27, 2017 was sent to PS-DBM which were duly acknowledged by the latter on August 10, 2017, yet no action was taken thereon.



77)		While for DARRO IVA, the unliquidated balance of ₱20.098 million is due to the problem of PS-DBM with its supplier which is still under litigation. 



78)		Partial deliveries and discrepancies between the cost of item delivered and actual fund transfer due to cost adjustments also contributed to the outstanding balance at year-end.



79)		The remaining funds at PS-DBM has deprived the government of the utilization of the amount for other useful purposes or projects while the inability of the PS-DBM to deliver the requested farm equipment has deprived the agrarian reform beneficiaries of the timely use of farm equipment in their operation.



80)		We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountants and Property Officers of:



a)	11 DAR offices to intensively exert efforts to coordinate and follow-up from PS-DBM, on the status of the procurement and delivery of common-use office supplies/materials, and the refund of any remaining funds for similar transactions; and issue supplemental Agency Procurement Request (APR) to PS-DBM to replace all unavailable stocks with another common-use supplies to fully utilize the previous transfer; and



b)	DARROs II and IVA to confirm the status of undelivered farm machineries and equipment, thereafter, arrange for the return/refund of the fund transfer for proper disposition, as the case maybe.



Dormant receivable accounts not requested for write-off



81)		Dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances and fund transfers amounting to ₱1,596.300 million were not requested for write-off by DARCO, DARRO VII and 12 DARPOs.



82)		COA Circular No. 2016-005 provides the following:



Section 5.4 - Dormant Receivable Accounts – accounts which balances remained inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for ten (10) years or more or where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.

84)		Most of the funds transferred to IAs and NGOs/POs were intended for the implementation of Bottom-Up Planning and Budgeting (BUB)/Grassroots Participatory Budgeting (GPB) projects, farm-to-market roads, infrastructure projects and livelihood programs.



85)		Absence of regular monitoring resulted in the accumulation of long-outstanding receivables, unliquidated cash advances and fund transfers, hence, the existence of dormant accounts amounting to ₱1,596.300 million which is contrary to COA Circular No. 2016-005.



86)		We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountants of concerned offices to:



a)	regularly monitor the settlement of receivables and liquidation of cash advances and fund transfers; and



b)	request for the write-off of dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances and unliquidated fund transfers, following the guidelines provided under COA Circular No. 2016-005, as applicable.



Insurance of physical assets with the GSIS



87)		DARCO, two DAR FAPs, seven DARROs and 44 DARPOs insured against fire or theft with the GIF of the GSIS property amounting to ₱645.137 million with corresponding insurance premiums paid in the amount of ₱3.337 million. However, physical assets amounting to ₱328.317 million were not insured, hence, the agency is at risk of not being indemnified in case of damage to or loss of property.



88)		Insurance of property of government agencies is required under RA No. 656, the Property Insurance Law, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 245 dated July 13, 1973, which states that all government entities shall insure with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) all their property against any insurable risk.



89)		The following DAR offices insured with the GSIS their property amounting to ₱645.137 million with corresponding payment of insurance premiums in the amount of ₱3.337 million, in accordance with RA No. 656:

91)		In FAPs MinSAAD, the amount of ₱0.025 million was allotted in its CY 2020 Budget representing Insurance Expense, yet, this amount was neither obligated nor disbursed at year-end. On the contrary, DARPO La Union claimed that the compliance thereon could not be implemented because there is no available fund for the insurance of all insurable properties and other assets. Nevertheless, Management commits to comply with the audit recommendation starting CY 2021 by making an inquiry with the GSIS on the total insurable amount of all its insurable properties for inclusion in the Project Procurement Management Plan (PPMP) for CY 2021.



92)		The non-coverage of all insurable physical assets amounting to ₱328.317 million with the GSIS Insurance Fund exposes the agency to the risk of not being indemnified or compensated for any damage to, or loss of its property thru theft, fire, flood, or other force majeure.



93)		Management commented that submission of pertinent documents for the application of property insurance was not given priority during the year due to the pandemic wherein Management efforts were concentrated on more urgent matters.  



94)		We recommended and Management agreed to: 



a)	instigate measures to address the adverse effects of pandemic that prevented the concerned offices to prioritize the coordination with the GIF of the GSIS for all the insurable property of the agency, pursuant to the Property Insurance Law;



b)	maximize fund utilization of allotted budget for Insurance Expense to avoid lapsing thereof at year-end; and



c)	direct the Budget Officer to coordinate with the Property Officer for the inclusion of annual budget to cover for the insurance of all insurable assets of the office.



Non-disposal of unserviceable property 



95)		Unserviceable property of DAR CO, FAPs, six DARROs and 33 DARPOs with a carrying amount of ₱62.810 million remained not disposed of, thus, exposing them to further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value.



96)		Section 79 of PD 1445 states, among others, that when government property has become unserviceable for any cause or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction.



97)		Unserviceable property with book value of ₱62.810 million that were already beyond repair were not disposed of, as follows:

98)		Some of these offices mentioned that this condition is a reiteration of prior year’s observation and that disposal was not done due to lack of manpower.



99)		Also, Management commented that one of the reasons for the non-disposal is the absence of COA personnel to witness the inspection of unserviceable property prior to the bidding process.  



100)		The basis for inspection of unserviceable property is the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP).  Records showed that the IIRUP was submitted to the Audit Team on May 18, 2021, despite several follow-ups.  The only invitation   to join the ocular inspection of unserviceable property received by the Audit Team was on May 31, 2021 and inspection was done on June 4, 2021, which was witnessed by a representative from the COA.  



101)		Nonetheless, it was clarified by the Audit Team that the Disposal Committee of the agency may proceed with the inspection of unserviceable property without the presence of a representative from the COA provided that the COA is duly notified in writing of such activity. 



102)		The delayed disposal exposes the unserviceable property to further deterioration and devaluation decreasing its realizable value. In addition, it causes congestion in the storeroom of the agency, occupying unnecessary space pending their disposal, which could have been utilized for other better purpose.  



103)		We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned DAR offices to coordinate with the Disposal Committee and Property Office to promptly act on the disposal procedure of all unserviceable property in compliance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445.



Emergency Procurement Activities During a State of Calamity 



104)		This year’s procurement of DARCO, four DARROs and 13 DARPOs of goods, consultancy services and infrastructure projects, through negotiated procurement (emergency purchase), amounting to ₱69.233 million. ₱0.061 million and ₱0.555 million, respectively, were in accordance with Section 53.2 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulation (IRR) of RA No. 9184 (Procurement Law).



	Submission of government contracts 



105)		Copy of government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents totaling 3,114 with corresponding amount of ₱272.365 million were submitted by 20 DAR Offices within the prescribed period and the same were verified to be complete and in order. Meanwhile, 20 DAR offices with 945 government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents amounting to ₱82.134 million were not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from one to 272 days as of year-end. Moreover, in 12 DAR offices, a total of 557 contracts and purchase orders amounting to ₱36.364 million were not submitted to the Auditor.



106)		COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 provides that government contracts, purchase orders and its supporting documents should be submitted to the Audit Team.  It provides the timelines within which the said documents should be submitted, as follows:



Item 3.1.1 - Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.  



Item 3.2.1 - A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and every supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned.



107)		For CY 2020, three DARROs, 15 DARPOs and two FAPs PMO/PMU were able to submit copy of government contracts and purchase orders and their supporting documents totaling 3,114 with corresponding amount of ₱272.365 million and the same were verified to be complete and in order, as follows:

109)		Management informed that the delay and non-submission of contracts were due to series of lockdowns, irregular work schedule during the pandemic, unavailability of signatories and contracts were not returned on time to Accounting Division due to health protocols being observed and other factors beyond their control.



110)		The delayed/non-submission of government contracts and POs, together with the supporting documents, prevents the Audit Team to conduct timely review and evaluation of the contracts.



111)		We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief, GSD of concerned Offices to instigate measures by exploring other means to address the adverse effects of pandemic to lessen if not eliminate the delays/non-submission of government contracts, purchase orders and its supporting documents within the prescribed period in view of generating a timely audit result. 

	

	Withholding and remittance of GSIS contributions and loans 

	

112)		The GSIS personal share, loans of employees and government share in 58 DAR offices amounting to ₱706.773 million were deducted properly and remitted without delay. However, GSIS personal shares and loans of employees of 19 DAR offices during the year amounting to ₱33.453 million were not deducted properly and remitted at year end.

	

113)		Section 3.4 Rule III of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the RA No. 8291 or the GSIS Act of 1997 provides that each employer shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and employers’ contributions within the first Ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply. The remittance by the employer of the contributions to the GSIS shall take priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except salaries and wages of its employees.



114)		For CY 2020, 58 DAR offices withheld properly and remitted without delay the amount of ₱706.773 million representing GSIS deductions for CY 2020 consisting of the personal share, loans of employees and the government share, in accordance with RA No. 8291, the GSIS Act of 1997.



115)		However, GSIS deductions for personal share and loans of employees amounting to ₱33.453 million in 19 DAR offices were not remitted during the year, including prior year’s unremitted balances as shown in the table below. Most of these include amounts for reconciliation.

The balances consist of the withheld amount for loans amortization with delays ranging from one to 16 days which were not remitted since the agency availed of the moratorium offered by the GSIS under GSIS Office of the Secretary Resolution No. 103 dated September 30, 2020 and GSIS Memorandum Circular No. 15, s. 2020, in support of the Bayanihan Act.

There were delinquencies of Loan Repayment in 45 personnel amounting to ₱1.024 million. The Accountant explained that when payments of loans are being made, the GSIS system does accept the payments and a message that "their loans had been already paid" will be prompted. In other words, the employees have no outstanding balance for the month. The monthly amortization reflected in the billing is also the amount deducted from the payroll as payment of the outstanding loan of an employee. In this situation, the excess deduction will be returned to employee. The GSIS personnel informed that they will send a "Deficiency Billing” to effect applicable deduction thereof since due amortization will not reflect on the system generated billing because the term of the loan has already ended.

a)	prepare a schedule for the unremitted balance, thereafter, coordinate with GSIS for reconciliation and remit or refund the balance of DARCO, DARRO XI, DARPOs Northern Samar, Ilocos Sur, Romblon, Camarines Sur II, Cebu, Biliran and Leyte, as the case may be;



b)	expedite the updating of records of the newly hired and promoted personnel with the GSIS, in order not to encounter difficulty in the remittances of their contribution and strictly deduct from the payroll the exact GSIS billing for the GSIS Apps – eBCS in DARPOs Albay and Iloilo;



c)	make representation with the GSIS on the payment of loan amortization in their automated system for an adjustment and ask advice for alternative option for the settlement of unpaid obligations in DARRO XIII and its four DARPOs; and



d)	review and reconcile the unremitted balances for immediate remittance thereof to GSIS in DARPO Davao City, DARROs VI, VII and VIII.



	Withholding and remittance of PhilHealth contributions 

	

118)		The PhilHealth personal share of employees in 62 DAR offices amounting to ₱62.849 million were deducted properly and remitted without delay, except however, for one DARRO and seven DARPOs with unremitted balance of ₱0.426 million with delay ranging from two to 730 days.



119)		Section 44 of RA No. 7875 states that Any employer or any officer authorized to collect contributions under this Act who, after collecting or deducting the monthly contributions from his employee’s compensation, fails to remit the said contributions to the Corporation within thirty (30) days from the date they become due shall be presumed to have misappropriated such contribution and shall suffer the penalties provided for in Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code.



120)		For CY 2020, 62 DAR offices withheld properly and remitted without delay the amount of ₱62.849 million representing PhilHealth contributions which consists of employees share and government share, in compliance with RA No. 7875, as amended.



121)		However, DARRO VII and seven DARPOs reported a total of unremitted balance of ₱0.426 million as at year-end, including prior year’s unremitted balance as shown below:

122)		Unremitted balances were usually subject for reconciliation which were carried over from previous years and were not given priority during the year due to skeletal/limited workforce requiring more attention on urgent matters. Likewise, the unremitted balance in DARPO Cebu pertains to unreconciled amount between the billed amount from PhilHealth and the withheld amount by the Accounting Office. The Accounting Division disclosed that the PHIC now issues a billing statement and the Agency pays the same. Usually, the amount billed is different from the amount withheld, hence, the under-remittance. 



123)		There were also unremitted balances reported in DARRO VI, DARPOs Iloilo and Bukidnon with an aggregate amount of ₱0.021 million subject for reconciliation.



124)		Unreconciled, unremitted and delayed remittances of compulsory contributions/ deductions of employees may deprive the employees of the benefits that may be derived from PhilHealth.



125)		We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountants of: 



a)	the concerned Offices to review the details of unremitted balances to determine disposition thereof, thereafter, monitor compliance on proper withholding and remittance pursuant to RA 7875, as amended; and



b)	DARPO Cebu to reconcile their records with the PhilHealth records to ensure that amounts withheld are always accurate and remitted intact.



	Withholding and remittance of Pag-IBIG contributions and loans 



126)		The agency deducted properly and remitted without delay the Pag-IBIG personal share and loans of employees of 67 DAR offices amounting to ₱883.483 million and remitted government’s share amounting to ₱8.374 million. Except, however, in seven DARPOs of which the amount of ₱0.210 million were not remitted on time, with delay ranging from 11 to 366 days.



127)		Rule VII of the IRR of RA No. 9679 provides that all employers shall remit to the Fund their contributions and the contributions of their covered employees as well as the latter’s loan amortizations or payments to the Fund, as provided for under Section 2 of this Rule, when applicable, within (15) days from the date the same were collected unless another period is previously agreed upon between the employer and the Fund, or within such periods as the Fund may prescribe otherwise xxx.



128)		For CY 2020, 67 DAR offices withheld properly and remitted without delay the total amount of ₱883.483 million representing Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) or Pag-IBIG contributions and loans deducted from salaries and wages of employees, as well as government’s share in total amount of ₱8.374 million, in compliance with RA No. 9679.

	

129)		However, seven DAR offices reported to have unremitted personal share and loans amounting to ₱0.210 million, as at year-end, including prior year’s unremitted balance, as shown below:

130)		DARRO VIII explained that the outstanding balance were dormant for years because of lack of available records/documents for reconciliation. Likewise, the unremitted balance in DARPO Davao City is attributed to unreconciled balances accruing from prior years which is still outstanding due to lack of manpower. Retrieving and maintaining documents to support the GL balance would consume their man-hours and thus may cause delay in their other work to be accomplished.



131)		Delayed remittances of contributions to Pag-IBIG is contrary to RA No. 9679 and may deprive the employees of the benefits that may be derived from Pag-IBIG Fund.



132)		We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountants of: 



a)	seven DAR offices to make the necessary reconciliation of records, thereafter, strictly abide in the timely remittance of withheld amounts to PagIBIG Fund in compliance with RA No. 9679; and



b)	DARPO Davao City Accounting Office to extend man-hours, whenever necessary, as it is their primary duty to ensure that all balances are duly accounted for as this may cause undue disadvantage on the benefits accruing to the employee.   

	

	Withholding and remittance of taxes

	

133)		Taxes on gross compensation income from officials and employees and government purchases and contract of services from suppliers/contractors of 64 DAR offices amounting to ₱431.377 million were properly withheld and remitted without delay. Except, however, in eight DAR offices of which the amount of ₱2.472 million were not remitted on time, with delay ranging from 30 to 1,095 days. Meanwhile, payment of honoraria and government procurement from suppliers under FAPs ConVERGE amounting to ₱1.788 million were not properly subjected to withholding tax.



134)		Below are the prevailing tax laws, rules and regulations rules in the withholding and remittance of government taxes:



--	   Item 1, Section 69 of PD No. 1445 states that “Public officers authorized to receive and collect moneys arising from taxes, revenues, or receipts of any kind shall remit or deposit intact the full amounts so received and collected by them to the treasury of the agency concerned and credited to the particular accounts to which the said moneys belong.” (emphasis ours)



--	   Revenue Regulation (RR) No. 11-2018 introduced tax laws reform to implement further amendments introduced by RA No. 10963, otherwise known as the TRAIN Law, relative to withholding of income taxes. It reiterated the provisions of Revenue Regulation No. 2-98 dated April 17, 1998, which provides that xxx withholding agents shall file BIR Monthly Remittance Form every tenth (10th) day of the following month when the withholding is made, regardless of the amount withheld.



--	   Further Section 6 of the same regulation amending Section 2.78.1 of RR No. 2-98 defines the term "compensation" as all remuneration for services performed by an employee for his employer under an employer-employee relationship. The name by which the remuneration for services is designated is immaterial. Thus, salaries, wages, emoluments and honoraria, allowances, commissions (such as transportation, representation, entertainment and the like), fees including director's fees, taxable pensions and retirement pay and other income of a similar nature constitute compensation income.



--	   The National Internal Revenue Code of the Philippines or the Tax Reform Act of 1997, as amended, requires the government agency payor to withhold the business taxes before making any payments to VAT registered and non-VAT registered taxpayers/suppliers/payees. Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 23-2014 dated June 20, 2014 states that on purchases of goods and services from non-VAT registered suppliers/payees, three percent (3%) of the gross payment shall be subjected to withholding tax on government money payments.



135)		For CY 2020, 64 DAR offices withheld properly and remitted without delay the amount of ₱431.377 million representing taxes on gross compensation income from officials and employees and those from private entities on government purchases and contracts of service, in compliance with Revenue Regulation No. 11-2018.



136)		However, taxes on gross compensation income from officials and employees and on government purchases and contracts of service from suppliers/contractors amounting to ₱2.472 million in eight DAR offices were not remitted on time, contrary to Revenue Regulation No. 10-2008 dated July 8, 2008, with delays ranging from 30 to 1,095 days.

138)		Moreover, audit disclosed the following non-compliance in the withholding of taxes sourced from FAPs Convergence on Value Chain Enhancement for Rural Growth and Empowerment Project (ConVERGE):



Particulars

Taxable Amount

(In Million Pesos)

Deficiency

Taxes on honorarium from officials and employees (CPMO, RPMO X and Bukidnon PMO)

1.439

The project paid honoraria to officials/ employees of DAR Central Office and DAR Regional Office X who were assigned in ConVERGE project. However, no tax deductions were made from the said honoraria despite the fact that honoraria, no matter how negligible the amount, are wealth that flows in the hands of the recipient which should be subjected to income tax and, consequently, to withholding tax on compensation in compliance with Section 2.78.1 of the Revenue Regulation No. 11-2018.

Taxes from suppliers/ contractors on government purchases of catering services (Camiguin PMO)

0.349

Not computed with the proper rate of three percent (3%) inconsistent with BIR RMO No. 23-2014. 

Total

1.788





139)		The non-imposition of taxes on the honoraria deprived the government from using the resources that could have been derived from the taxes to finance other projects for the benefit of the general public.



140)		Likewise, the incorrect computation of withholding taxes in Camiguin PMO unnecessarily exposes the agency to a risk of paying to the BIR fines and penalties.



141)		Management commented that since CY 2017, DAR has been paying honorarium to DAR officials and employees involved in the FAPs ConVERGE project implementation but no audit observation was received on the incorrect application of tax rate.  



142)		We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountants of:



a)	eight DAR offices to (i) conduct thorough and regular analysis for the disposition of prior year unreconciled balances, thus, excess credits will be adjusted early and remaining tax withheld balances be remitted properly; and (ii) thereafter, closely monitor the withholding and intact remittance of taxes from all funds within the prescribed period to avoid the imposition of penalty on the unremitted amounts; and



b)	FAPs ConVERGE to (i) ensure that prescribed withholding taxes are deducted from payments made and the same are remitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue within the prescribed period; and (ii) compute for the withholding taxes on non-VAT registered suppliers/payees using the proper rate of three percent (3%) based on the gross amount and remit intact the taxes withheld on the prescribed period in compliance with BIR rules and regulations.



143)		On the non-imposition of appropriate income tax rate on honorarium paid since CY 2017, we would like to reiterate under Section 2.78.1 as amended, supra, that honorarium constitutes compensation income, hence, were incorporated in the annual income tax return (ITR) of the concerned officials and employees in the given taxable period. Any tax deficiency during the grant of honorarium shall automatically considered and annualized at year-end upon filing of the annual ITR.



Hiring of and payments to job orders and contract of service individuals 



144)		As of December 31, 2020, DARCO, 15 DARROs and 75 DARPOs hired 2,194 individuals covered with Contract of Service (COS) or Job Order (JO) on a semestral basis, in accordance with CSC COA DBM Joint Circular No. 1 dated June 15, 2017, as updated by CSC COA DBM Joint Circular No. 2, s 2020, dated October 20, 2020, to augment the regular plantilla employees of 7,660 and 700 co-terminus position, due to shortage of manpower. Their salaries were charged against Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) in the total amount of ₱281.575 million, as authorized under DBM Circular Letter (CL) No. 2013-5 dated July 22, 2013. As of December 31, 2020, the agency has a total of 1,692 unfilled plantilla position. 

	

	GAD budget, utilization and accomplishments

	

145)		Thirty-three (33) DAR offices allocated the amount of ₱124.565 million or seven percent of the total appropriations of ₱1,780.148 million for GAD programs and activities. However, only 18 DAR offices implemented all of its planned activities with fund utilization of ₱73.498 million or 111.88 percent. Moreover, 20 DAR offices allocated only the amount of ₱37.503 million or 2.92 percent of the combined appropriations of ₱1,283.236 million for GAD programs and activities while FAPs MinSAAD, ConVERGE and IARCDSP did not allocate five to 30 percent of overseas development assistance of ₱460.016 million for GAD programs and activities.



146)		Below are the prevailing laws, rules and regulations rules in the allocation and utilization of GAD plans and budget:



--	   Section 31 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020 provides that the GAD plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent of their budgets.



--		   PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 requires the submission of the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) by the GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) to the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) for review prior to the submission of the agency budget proposal to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM).



--		   Pursuant to RA No. 7192, the Women in Development and Nation Building Act requires government agencies receiving official development assistance to allocate five percent to thirty (30%) percent to gender-responsive programs that complement the government GAD funds and annually report accomplishments thereof to the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) and the PCW.



147)		For CY 2020, GAD planning and implementation was done separately by CO and each of the regional and provincial offices of DAR. The following 33 DAR Offices have allocated at least five percent of their total appropriations for the implementation of GAD related activities:

150)		The following are the deficiencies related to the implementation of GAD by DAR offices:



--	    DARCO did not furnish the Audit Team the GAD Accomplishment Report for CY 2020, hence, outputs/accomplishments on planned activities could not be assessed and evaluation on the utilization of GAD budget based on GAD performance indicators could not be made. Moreover, the allocated amount for DARCO could not be determined due to absence of detailed GPB for DARCO.  Further, it has allocated less than five percent of its total appropriations for GAD-related activities.



--	   The GAD Plan and Budget of DARPOs Ilocos Sur, Ilocos Norte, Quezon I, Siquijor and Negros Oriental were not reviewed and properly endorsed by PCW in compliance with PCW NEDA DBM JMC 2012-01, thus, we could not further assess whether those considered GAD activities as well as the programs’ attributions were eligible had these had been implemented.



151)		Furthermore, the FAPs MinSAAD and ConVERGE did not allocate five to 30 percent (5-30%) of its total appropriation of ₱198.907 million for GAD programs and activities attributed to its failure to submit GAD Plan and Budget and Accomplishment Report. Likewise, for IARCDSP, the HGDG submitted by MLO is deficient due to the absence of GAD individual and overall score, and feedback from PCW and NEDA as to whether the HGDG test prepared, for the attribution of IARCDSP fund and activities representing GAD, is appropriate. Hence, we could not ascertain whether the mandatory 5-30 percent GAD allocation from FY 2020 GAA for IARCDSP of ₱261.109 million, was attained.



152)		Management explained that FAPs IARCDSP was implemented in CY 2011 prior to the issuance of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01, hence formulation of GAD interventions in compliance with the JC were not exactly implemented. Nevertheless, GAD activities, as required by the project guidelines were duly mainstreamed in project implementation.



153)		We recommended and Management agreed to direct the:



a)	concerned DAR offices to (i) coordinate immediately with DAR GAD Focal Point System for the preparation and submission of Annual GPB and GAD AR to the PCW and the audit team, for review/evaluation; and(ii) ensure full utilization of GAD budget and reporting and accomplishment by integrated of various GAD programs and projects in the Agency’s regular activities; and



b)	FAPs ConVERGE and MinSAAD to comply with the prescribed five to 30 percent GAD allocation.









Senior Citizen and Person with Disability plans/programs 



154)		Forty-six (46) DAR Offices spent ₱15.008 million in the implementation of the activities for the SCPD, in addition to providing ramps, a wheelchair and priority lane for them. Meanwhile, no plans, programs and projects for SCPD were formulated in 16 DAR offices.



155)		Section 32 of the GAA for FY 2020 provides that, “All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.”



156)		The following DAR offices conducted activities for Senior Citizen and Persons with Disability (SCPD), such as provision of lounge, ramps, wheelchair, priority lanes, hand bars in the CR, lavatory, industrial fan, free legal assistance and livelihood, full time Work from Home (WFH) arrangement for Persons with Disability (PWDs) and personnel with comorbidities, service to PWD personnel who were assigned for skeletal workforce, and virtual stress management amounting to ₱15.008 million:

*SCPD activities were integrated with the regular activities



157)		In contrast, 16 DAR offices (DARCO, DARROs III, VI, XI and DARPOs La Union, Ilocos Norte, Tarlac, Batangas, Palawan, Sorsogon, Iloilo, Guimaras, Northern Samar, Camiguin, Davao del Sur and Davao Oriental)  failed to prepare/ submit their annual plans, programs and projects intended to address the needs of the SCPDs, as required in Section 32 of the General Provisions of the CY 2020 GAA, thus, depriving them the benefits or projects that would address their needs and concerns. 



158)		The failure of Management to prioritize the formulation and implementation of SCPD plans, programs and project is an explicit disregard of government efforts to improve the total well-being of the elderly and PWDs, and enable them to participate fully and become active partners of the agency in nation building. 



159)		Likewise, the non-submission of plans, programs and projects and the corresponding accomplishment report precluded the Audit Team from validating the necessity and responsiveness of the plans, programs and projects intended to address the needs of the senior citizens and differently-able person.



160)		We recommended and Management agreed to instruct DAR offices to formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of SCPD, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities; thereafter, submit the same to the Office of the Auditor for evaluation purposes.

	

Delayed implementation of ODA-funded projects resulting in commitment fees of ₱11.533 million



161)		SPLIT and MinSAAD ODA-funded projects, with total project cost of ₱29,027.672 million were not implemented in accordance with the period of implementation, thus, were delayed and resulted in the incurrence of commitment fees amounting to ₱11.533 million.



162)		A commitment fee is a banking term used to describe a fee charged by a lender, in this case the World Bank, to a borrower to compensate for its commitment to lend. Commitment fees typically are associated with unused credit lines or undisbursed loans. During the year, MinSAAD and SPLIT projects incurred commitment fee as follows:

a)	SPLIT project commitment fee – ₱11.416 million



163)		Section 2.04 of the SPLIT Loan Agreement No. 9141-PH approved on July 14, 2020 which consist of Loan Proceeds programmed fund of ₱19,240.000 million (USD370.000 million) for four years starting CY 2020, provides that The Commitment Charge is one quarter of one percent (0.25%) per annum of the Unwithdrawn Loan Balance. (emphasis ours)

	

164)		After the lapse of six months since the loan approval, the government has already incurred ₱11.416----footnote1---- million commitment fees due to the non-withdrawal/availment of loan proceeds during the first year of loan effectivity, which could have been avoided or minimized had the project been implemented in accordance with period of implementation.



165)		Considering the first year of project implementation, the government has already incurred financial loss in terms of commitment fees which could have been avoided or minimized.



b)	MinSAAD project commitment fee – ₱0.117 million



166)		Section 3 Article II of the Loan Agreement entered into between the DAR and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) dated March 30, 2012 for the MinSAAD project provides that the borrower shall pay commitment charge to JICA semi-annually at the rate of one-tenth percent (0.1%) per annum on the total unused balance of the amount which falls under categories A-D as set forth in Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement for the period from and including 120 days from the date of signature of the Loan Agreement up to and including the date of the completion of the disbursement of proceeds of the loan. (emphasis ours)



167)		Due to further extension of project completion up to December 31, 2020, additional commitment fees were incurred by the project for the year amounting to ₱0.117 million. Overall, after the lapse of eight years of project implementation or from 2012-2020, total commitment fees incurred by the project amounted to ₱11.434 million, as follows:

168)		It is noteworthy to mention that MinSAAD project’s overall loan performance, as shown in its 4th Quarter Progress Report, has registered an availment rate of 97.94 percent, however, project extensions has incurred the government an additional financial loss of ₱1.409 million in terms of commitment fees which could have been avoided or minimized had the project implementers strictly monitored the project’s targets and accomplishments.



169)		In the exit conference, the FAPs PMO provided the following explanation on the non-implementation of the SPLIT project during the year:



--	The loan became effective only on October 9, 2020, though the loan agreement was signed on July 14, 2020 and the commitment fees started incurring 60 days after the Loan Agreement has been signed at 0.25% on undisbursed amount, pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Agreement.



--	As of March 17, 2021 the project has not received the SARO for the Loan Proceeds for the 1st year (CY 2020) despite submission of request last November 18, 2020 for the release of SARO for the remaining months of CY 2020 amounting to ₱114.212 million (LP-₱52.273 million, GOP-₱61.975 million). Again, on February 11, 2021, Management forwarded a request for the release of continuing appropriation amounting to ₱1,565.71 million (LP-₱1,065 million, GOP-₱500 million), but per DBM, the requested SARO for loan proceeds will not be released since the fund source was under the unprogrammed funds of CY 2020, hence, could not be considered as continuing appropriation. In view thereof, DBM advised to modify the CY 2021 proposed budget for Loan Proceeds.



170)		Request for the release of CY 2021 SARO Loan Proceeds of ₱1 billion was already submitted. Management is also preparing the first Withdrawal Application requesting for the release of the six-month cash requirement based on the modified CY 2021 budget of the Loan Proceeds to the World Bank.



171)		Management instructed the PMO to coordinate with the BTr on whether the commitment fee, which is material in amount, charged from the project is reasonable and proper considering that funds were not yet immediately available for project implementation during the year.



172)		We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Project Heads of:



a)	SPLIT to coordinate with (i) DOF, NEDA and DBM on the current predicament in the start-up project implementation as a result of the delayed release of fund and resolve any adverse effects leading to the delayed project implementation; and (ii) BTr on the reasonableness of charging commitment fee considering that delay is due to the non-release of project fund during the year; and



b)	MinSAAD to ensure efficient fund utilization by considering readiness and ability to implement the project before submitting project design/proposal.



Receipt and utilization of Disaster Related Fund 



173)		The agency did not receive and disburse Disaster Risk Reduction Management (DRRM) Fund   and/or Quick Response Fund (QRF).



Audit suspensions, disallowances, charges and settlements



174)		NSs, NDs and NCs were issued for transactions audited during the year amounting to ₱64.126 million due to non-compliance with various laws, rules and regulations. Moreover, only the amount of ₱60.847 million was settled with corresponding NSSDCs issued during the year, leaving unsettled suspensions, disallowances and charges amounting to ₱5,116.085 million as of the end of the year.



175)		Sections 7.1.1, 9.4, 10.4, 11.4 and 17.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2006, prescribing the use of the Revised Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA), provide the following:



“The head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: (a) xxx; (b) the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within the prescribed period; (c) the requirement of transactions suspended in audit are complied with; and (d) appropriate actions are taken on deficiencies noted as contained in the AOM.



A suspension should be settled within ninety (90) calendar days from receipt of the NS; otherwise the transaction covered by it shall be disallowed/charged after the auditor considers that documentary compliance/justification have not satisfied himself. Consequently, the auditor shall issue corresponding ND/NC.



The disallowance shall be settled within six months from receipt of the ND by the persons liable.



The audit charge shall be settled within six (6) months from the date of receipt of the NC.



Any person aggrieved by the disallowance or charge may within the six months from receipt of the notice, appeal in writing as prescribed in these Rules. A disallowance or charge not appealed within the period prescribed shall become final and executory.”



176)		Section 13.1 and 13.2 of COA Cir. 2009-006 dated Sept. 15, 2009 provides that the Auditor shall issue the Notice of Settlement of Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges (NSSDC) whenever a suspension/disallowance or charge is settled. It further provides that the NSSDC shall be addressed to the agency head and accountant, copy furnished the persons responsible/liable and shall indicate the NS/ ND/NC settled, amount, nature of transaction and mode of settlement.



177)		The status of the audit suspensions, disallowances and charges per office/region as of the end of the year is as follows:

178)		The NSs issued by DAR offices for CY 2020 were on the payment of legal consultants, purchase of farm inputs and machinery, training expenses. These were suspended pending submission of documentary and other requirements provided by rules and regulations. Also, NDs were issued for suspensions that have matured into disallowance such as the payment of legal consultancy services without the COA concurrence in DARCO, excessive claims for gasoline and communication expenses, purchase of farm inputs and allowances. 



179)		NDs under appeal are as follows: 

--	DARCO – ₱6.092 million for various transactions incurred in CYs 2012 to 2013;

--	FAPs MinSAAD – ₱2.097 million for the payment of honoraria, 13th month pay, gift checks  and other benefits to various officials, employees and/or COS in CYs 2012 to 2013;

--	Region I – ₱0.175 million representing excess payment of CNA and irregular payment of Anniversary Bonus in prior years for DARRO I; Invalidated appointment by the CSC, Central Office, Quezon City with corresponding amount of ₱0.169 million for DARPO La Union; Unauthorized payment of salaries and other personnel benefits of ₱0.416 million due to absence of Appointment in DARPO Pangasinan;

--	Region V - ₱11.207 million for various transactions incurred in CY 2013 of DARPO Masbate; ₱8.803 million and ₱23.333 million related to prior years’ transactions of DARPO Camarines Sur I and Camarines Sur II, respectively;

--	Region XI - ₱1.789 million and ₱5.714 million related to prior years’ transactions of DARPO Davao City and Davao Del Sur, respectively. 



180)		Reported settlement for the year amounted to ₱60.847 million, is only 1.18 percent of the total suspensions, disallowances and charges of ₱5,176.932 million. Most of 

the ongoing settlements through installments were not requested authority with the PLO, Legal Services Sector of COA inconsistent with Sections 3 and 9 of COA Resolution No. 2017-021 dated November 3, 2017, which provides that:



Section 3 - Requests for installment payment may be made directly by the persons liable to settle their liabilities. For audit disallowances involving several persons liable, the head of agency or its authorized official may request installment payment in their behalf, provided that a written authority is issued by the persons liable and attached to the request.  Only those persons liable with written authority shall be allowed to settle their liability in installment.



Section 9 - Requests for installment payment covering cases which are not covered by this Resolution shall be submitted to the Commission Proper for its consideration, after evaluation and recommendation of the Prosecution and Litigation Office (PLO), Legal Services Sector (LSS).



181)		The low percentage of settlement is mainly due to the failure of Management to enforce the above cited provisions which resulted in the accumulation of audit suspensions, disallowances and charges and has deprived the government of the use of the funds from the settlement for other purposes.



182)		We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	adhere to (i) laws, rules and regulations in the disbursement of funds to prevent incurrence of audit suspensions, disallowances and charges;       (ii) the provisions of RRSA under COA Circular 2009-006 by requiring the settlement of suspensions, disallowances, and charges within the prescribed period to prevent accumulation of unsettled NS, ND and NC; and (iii) Sections 3 and 9 of COA Resolution No. 2017-021 by requesting authority from COA PLO, LSS to settle audit disallowances with finality by installment;



b)	strengthen its controls on the monitoring of status of compliance and settlement of NSs/NDs/NCs by ensuring that concerned responsible and liable persons are duly acquainted with their duty to fully settle suspended/disallowed accounts within the reglementary period to preclude the issuance of finality of decision; and



c)	ensure to submit request for authority to warrant the instalment settlement of disallowances given that full settlement is not really feasible during this time. 









C)	Compliance Audit – National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) Project Funds



Allocation, utilization and disbursement of funds

	

183)		The DARCO allocated/attributed budget of ₱91.575 million for the implementation of programs and activities in support of the NTF-ELCAC project cannot be properly evaluated due to absence of relevant documents/incomplete information affecting the appropriateness and accuracy of the reports submitted.  Moreover, of the total attribution of ₱91.575 million, only ₱40.001 million or 43.68 percent was obligated and not in accordance with the original purpose of the attribution.



184)		Section 9 of EO No. 70 states that:

	

	“The initial funding requirements for the implementation of this Order shall be charged against existing appropriations of member-agencies of the Task Force and such other appropriate funding sources as the DBM may identify, and when necessary, the Contingent Fund, subject to relevant laws, rules and regulations.

	

	The succeeding year’s appropriations for the operation of the National Secretariat shall be included in the budget proposal of the OP.  The funding requirement for the implementation of the programs, plans, and activities in the Framework shall be included in the respective annual budgets of the concerned agencies, subject to the usual budget preparation process.”

	

185)		Review of the reports submitted revealed the following deficiencies:

		

--		absence of information as to the basis for the attributed amount for each office/ region;  

--		absence of rationale and/or authority to modify the attributed ELCAC funds to ARBold (Agrarian Reform Bold ARBold Move for Deliverance of ARs from COVID 19 Pandemic) project;

--		absence of Work and Financial Plan with performance indicators and targets for ARBold project; 

--		absence of information as to the basis for the amount downloaded for ARBold project to 62 different field operating units (FOUs); and

--		absence of information as to where and how much was disbursed out of the obligations incurred.

	

186)		On January 25, 2021, the management informed that the Department identified land tenure and support services within its mandate as contribution/assistance in the implementation of ELCAC. It has submitted to the Task Force the following Program/Activity/Project (PAPs) that are attributed to ELCAC: a) Land Distribution, particularly on the Emancipation Patents/Certificate of Land Ownership Award (EP/CLOA) distribution; b) Provision of Capacity Enhancement to ARBs; and c) Provision of Credit and Microfinance Services.  Also, it has not received any budget allocation for ELCAC from the Task Force or Department of Budget and Management (DBM).

	

187)		Likewise, on even date a copy of the target and budget matrix for CY 2020 was submitted to the Audit Team.  It showed that a total of ₱410.606 million was attributed out of its CY 2020 general appropriations for the implementation of the different programs for ELCAC since there was no separate budget released by DBM, as follows:

The Summary of Financial Reports of the DARCO and Regional Offices on their incurred obligations and disbursements made on activities/programs attributed to the ELCAC as of August 31, 2020, disclosed that the attributed amount of ₱91.575 million remained unutilized and there was no physical target indicated for DARCO as to the number of ARBs trained.

191)		Information on the basis used in the attribution of funds for the activities of the said project in the Central Office and Regional Offices was not submitted to the Audit Team, as such, validation thereof could not be made.



192)		In the absence of the Report on Fund Allocation and Utilization as of December 31, 2020, the status of fund utilization of DARCO amounting to ₱91.575 million cannot be properly evaluated. On January 11, 2021, the Audit Team sent a letter to DARCO management requesting submission of relevant documents.  



193)		The management in its letter reply dated February 11, 2021 on the above observations which was received by the Audit Team on February 24, 2021 commented that, and we quote:

		

			a)			With regard to the bases of computation of the attributed amount to ELCAC, per memorandum of Director Robert Anthony Yu of Planning Service dated 04 February 2021, it was cited that the land tenure and support services subject of attribution are basic services that our Department can contribute, for the former insurgents to restart with their lives, fight poverty and to return to mainstream society and economy.  Hence, the said activities of the DAR were identified and reported to Task Force (TF) ELCAC with the amount attributed, from the DAR’s allocation. Attached is the memorandum of Dir. Yu for reference.

		

			b)			We wish to inform you that the ₱91.575 million representing the attributed allotment under DARCO was modified to subsidies.

		

			c)				The DAR modified the above cited funds to subsidies to finance the project “The PaSSOver: ARBold Move for Deliverance of our ARs from COVID 19 Pandemic”. A total of ₱49.424 million was downloaded by DARCO through Sub-Allotment Release Orders to the Field Operating Units (FOUs) to implement the project.

	

194)		In reply, hereunder is the Auditor’s Rejoinder dated March 19, 2021:

		

a)	No copy of the said memorandum of Dir. Yu was attached to the letter reply, hence, the Audit Team has no reference for the validation on the computation for the attributed amount for each office/region.

		

b)	Review of the submitted report on fund allocation and utilization as of December 31, 2020, still showed that the allocated amount of ₱91.575 million for DARCO for the provision of capacity enhancement to ARBs remained as unobligated allotment.

	

c)		With regard to the downloaded amount of ₱49.424 million to the field operating units, there was no breakdown or information on the following:

	

--		Name of field operating units;

195)		Another Management reply was received by the Audit Team on April 8, 2021 informing that the DARCO modified the attributed fund of ₱91.575 million to Subsidies to finance the project “The PaSSOver: ARBold Move for Deliverance of ARs from COVID 19 Pandemic” instead of the provision of capacity enhancement to ARBs as originally planned.  

	

196)		Moreover, it was clarified that the said amount is composed of ₱45.152 million from Enterprise Development and Economic Support (EDES) and ₱46.423 million from Climate Resilient Farm Productivity Support (CRFPS) allocations, for the provision of credit and microfinance services and agricultural extension services/ farm input support, respectively. 

	

197)		Further, the amount of ₱40.001 million or 43.68 percent of ₱91.575 million was downloaded by DARCO to 61 FOUs for the implementation of ARBold through Sub-Allotment Release Orders (Sub-AROs) wherein ₱32.339 million or 80.85 percent was obligated by the different FOUs. However, there was no information as to how much was disbursed out of the obligations incurred by the FOUs.



198)		Confirmation letters (CLs) were sent to 61 FOUs to confirm if the downloaded amounts were received and utilized according to the purpose for which they were transferred. As of report writing, 25 FOUs or 40.98 percent of 61 have already replied.  Results of the confirmation disclosed the following:

199)		On April 28, 2020, DAR Memorandum Circular No. 12 series of 2020 was issued re: Implementation Guidelines for The PaSSOver: ARBold Move for Deliverance of ARBs from the COVID 19 Pandemic.  

	

200)		Section I, paragraph 3 thereof states that, “x x x, the DAR has come up with a contingency plan/project proposal entitled “The PaSSOver: ARBold Move to Heal as One Deliverance of our ARBs from COVID 19 Pandemic” to support its ARBs affected by the COVID-19 who are front liners in food security, especially in this time of public health crisis.”

	

201)		Also, paragraph 4 of the same Section provides that, “The project will be funded from the realigned budget of the ARBDSP to source from the unobligated allotment of different units of the Support Service Office (SSO) and from the various regional and provincial offices of DAR.  The SSO will also set aside from their GAS budget allotment certain amount for this project.”

	

202)		The project intends to provide immediate essential support services to men and women ARBs to mitigate the impact of community quarantine measures due to COVID-19 and address the demands affecting the agriculture sector even after the complete lifting of the ECQ or upon the start of the “new normal”.

	

203)		There are four (4) components of the ARBold project, as follows:

	

a)		Support to ARBOs as Frontliners in the Food Supply Chain

b)		Farm Productivity Assistance to ARBs

c)		Livelihood Support for Women in Crisis Situation

d)		Package of Supplemental Food and Non-Food Items

	

204)		Considering that the ARBold project has its own purpose/objectives as well as funding source as contemplated in its guidelines, the modification of ELCAC funds to ARBold defeats the purpose for which the fund was originally intended. 

	

205)		Furthermore, there was no information on the following:

	

f)		rationale and/or authority to modify the attributed ELCAC funds to ARBold project;

g)		work and financial plan with performance indicators and targets of the project ARBold to be implemented by FOUs;

h)		basis of the amount downloaded for ARBold to different FOUs; and

i)		information as to whom and how much was disbursed out of the obligations incurred.

	

206)		In view of the foregoing, the completeness, accuracy and appropriateness of the report submitted cannot be validated or evaluated.

	

207)		Of the balance of ₱51.574 million that remained with the DARCO, the amounts of ₱31.485 million and ₱1.688 million were obligated for the provision of agricultural extension services and farm input support; and for the conduct of enterprise development interventions, respectively, leaving a balance of ₱18.401 million which was then later sub-allotted to the different field offices under the Enterprise Development and Economic Support (EDES) at ₱8.952 million and Climate Resilient Farm Productivity Support (CRFPS) at ₱10.991 million or a total sub-allotment of ₱19.943 million, which is more than the reported balance of ₱18.401 million or a difference of  ₱1.542 million.

	

208)		Further, obligations incurred out of the downloaded amount of ₱19.943 million amounted to ₱17.843 million, leaving an unobligated balance of ₱2.100 million.   But Management reported that the unobligated balance was ₱0.558 million, hence, a difference of ₱1.542 million.

	

209)		The Management submitted on June 2, 2021 the following:

	

a)		Copy of the Memorandum dated February 4, 2021 of Director Robert Anthony P. Yu of the Planning Service re: bases for the attributed amount for each office/region;

b)		Explanation on the modification of the ELCAC funds to ARBold project;

c)		Work and Financial Plan with performance indicators and targets for ARBold project; 

d)		Approved Activity Proposal; and

e)		Status of Fund Utilization.

	

210)		The submitted reports and information are subject for evaluation by the Audit Team.

		

211)		We recommended and Management agreed to cause the full utilization of funds and timely implementation of planned program, projects and activities in accordance with the original purpose it was intended and to submit immediately the following to the Audit Team:

	

a)	basis for the attributed amount for each office/region;



b)	rationale and/or authority to modify the attributed ELCAC funds to ARBold project;



c)	work and financial plan with performance indicators and targets for ARBold project;



d)	basis for the amount downloaded for ARBold project to different FOUs; and



e)	information as to whom and how much was disbursed out of the obligations incurred.
