E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

Among the significant audit observations and corresponding recommendations as 

discussed in detail in Part II are summarized below:  

 

1. The accuracy and reliability of Office Supplies Inventory account totaling 
₱130,118.30 could not be ascertained due to: (a) non-maintenance of Stock 

Cards (SC) and Supplies Ledger Cards (SLC); (b) irregular/non-submission of 

the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) and unsupported Journal 

Entry Vouchers (JEV) with Requisition and Issue Slips (RIS) to record supplies 

issued for the month; and (c) non-reconciliation of the result of actual physical 

count of inventories with the accounting records, contrary to applicable 

provisions of Chapter 8, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual 

(GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs). (Observation 1) 

 

We recommended strict adherence to applicable provisions of the 

aforesaid Manual and the Management agreed to require:  
 

a. the Accounting Unit, in coordination with the Supply Officer, 
determine the causes of the discrepancy of ₱12,447.66 and make the 

necessary adjustments in order to reconcile the balances in the RPCI 

and in the books of accounts; 
 

b. the Property and Accounting Units to properly maintain their 
respective records and to regularly reconcile their inventory per 

books and per count; and 
 

c. the Supply Officer to regularly submit to the Accounting Unit the 
RSMI with duly signed RIS/ICS by the end users for proper 

recording in the books. 
 

2. The year-end balance of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts 
amounting to ₱1,630,561.34 of the Agency is unreliable due to continued non-

adherence with the pertinent provisions of Chapter 10, GAM for NGAs, Vol. 

1 and Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 

2020, as follows: (a) non-maintenance of PPE Ledger Cards (PPELC) and 

Property Cards (PC) that support the PPE balances; (b) misclassification of 

semi-expandable properties under PPE with an aggregate amount of 



 

vii 

 

₱124,607.50; and (c) unreconciled reporting difference of ₱718,844.62 

between the Accounting books and Property records. (Observation No. 2) 

 

We reiterated our recommendations to Management to:  
 

a. direct the concerned officers to maintain and update the PPELC and 
PC and reconcile both records, as prescribed under the GAM for 

NGAs, Volume I to facilitate adjustment of the discrepancy of 

₱718,844.62 and reflect the correct balance of the PPE account;  
 

b. instruct the Accountant to reclassify all PPE items costing below the 
capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 to the appropriate Inventories 

accounts. For items that had been issued to end-users, debit the 

appropriate Expenses account and for monitoring of accountability, 

the issuances thereof should be covered by ICS; and 
 

c. strictly observe the uniform property identification system for PPE 
as required under Section 5 of COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated 

January 31, 2020. 

 

3. Grant of Representation Allowance and Transportation Allowance (RATA) 
totaling ₱140,896.56 to the Head of the Agency of NCCT was not supported 

with complete documentations, contrary to Section 4 (6) of Presidential Decree 

(PD) No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-01 dated June 14, 2012, casting 

doubts as to the propriety of the payment of the said allowances.          

(Observation No. 3) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. immediately submit the required certification that the concerned 
officer did not use government vehicle and the proof of service 

rendered; and 

 

b. refrain from granting Transportation Allowance to 
officials/employees who are assigned or presently use government 

motor vehicle even under the M/ECQ or GCQ. 

 

4. Disbursements totaling ₱4,273,614.05 were found not duly supported with 
basic documentary requirements contrary to Sections 4.6 of PD No. 1445 and 

COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, thus the validity of claims 

and propriety of the transactions cannot be ascertained. (Observation No. 4) 

 

We reiterated the prior year’s recommendations that Management submit 

immediately the required supporting document listed in the table in 

paragraph 4.2, otherwise, the non-submission thereof would necessitate 

the issuance of Notice of Suspension.   
 



 

viii 

 

5. Information and technology (IT) equipment amounting to ₱716,067.00 were 
procured through Small Value Procurement – Shopping without 

quotations/canvass from at least three suppliers, contrary to pertinent 

provisions of Section 52 of 2016 Revised IRR of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184. 

Further, the same was not posted in the Philippine Government Electronic 

Procurement System (PhilGEPS) website as required under Section 21.2.1 of 

the same IRR; hence, these procedural lapses did not assure that the most 

advantageous price for these items was obtained by the Agency.        

(Observation No. 5) 

 

We recommended that Management strictly adhere to the provisions of 

RA No. 9184 and its IRR to ensure that the most advantageous price will 

be obtained by the government in all its purchases and procure common-

use supplies and equipment from the DBM-PS, and if not available, the 

purchase thereof from private suppliers should be supported by a 

Certificate of Non-Availability of Stocks. 

 

6. Transparency in governance was not fully assured by the  NCCT when the 
posting and updating of the information on donations, trust receipts, public 

funds, audit, financial  and physical reports, as well as the required 

‘Transparency Seal’ in its official website have not been completely 

undertaken as mandated under Sections  89 to 92 and 94 of the General 

Provisions (GP), GAA for FY 2020 or RA No. 11465; thus, depriving the 

public of pertinent information necessary to enforce accountability among its 

officials and affected the Agency’s eligibility for Performance-Based Bonus 

(PBB) in CY 2020 due to non-compliance with the good governance conditions 

required under Memorandum Circular No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 2020. 

(Observation No. 6) 

 

We reiterate our recommendation that the Management: 

 

a. comply strictly with Sections 89, 90, 91, and 94 of the General 
Provisions of the GAA of 2020 or RA No. 11465 and Section 4 of 

Memorandum Circular No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 2020 issued by 

IATF on the Harmonization of National Government Performance 

Monitoring, Information and Reporting Systems; and 

 

b. ensure that the Agency’s available information technology resources 
are utilized to make certain that the transparency and accountability 

of its operational and financial affairs are strictly implemented.  

 

The foregoing audit observations and recommendations were communicated 

through Audit Observation Memoranda. Due to the present situation caused by                   

COVID-19, the conduct of the exit conference was not feasible. In lieu thereof, we 

furnished the Management a copy of the Summary of Audit Observations and 

Recommendations on the results of audit conducted for the CY 2020 on March 25, 2021. 

Their comments were incorporated in this Annual Audit Report (AAR), where appropriate.
