PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

OTHER ACCOUNTING DEFICIENCIES 

 

Unascertained accuracy and reliability of the Office Supplies Inventory account 

 

1. The accuracy and reliability of Office Supplies Inventory account totaling 
₱130,118.30 could not be ascertained due to: (a) non-maintenance of Stock 

Cards (SC) and Supplies Ledger Cards (SLC); (b) irregular/non-submission of 

the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) and unsupported Journal 

Entry Vouchers (JEV) with Requisition and Issue Slips (RIS) to record supplies 

issued for the month; and (c) non-reconciliation of the result of actual physical 

count of inventories with the accounting records, contrary to applicable 

provisions of Chapter 8, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual 

(GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs).  

 

1.1. Section 13, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides 
that: 

 

“The Inventory Accounting System consists of the system of 

monitoring, controlling and recording of acquisition and disposal of 

inventory. 

 

Physical count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an 

indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property 

custodianship.” 

 

1.2. Likewise, Section 14 of the same provides the Inventory Accounting Sub-
Systems, which discusses in detail the procedures for the receipt, inspection, 

acceptance and recording of deliveries of inventory items; requisition and 

issue of inventory items; and transfer and/or disposal of inventory items. 

 

1.3. While, Section 17 enumerates the records, forms and reports to be prepared 
and/or maintained for inventories; to wit: 

 

“b. Stock Card (Appendix 58) – shall be used to record all receipts 

and issues of supplies and the balance in quantity at any time. It 

shall be maintained by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit 

for each item in stock. The Inspection and Acceptance Report 

(IAR), RIS, Purchase Order (PO) and Delivery Receipt (DR) serve 

as the original sources of information for making entries on the 

card.  



25 
 

c. Supplies Ledger Card (Appendix 57) – shall be used to record 

materials received, issued and the balance both in quantity and 

amount at any time.  It shall be maintained by the Accounting 

Division/Unit for each kind of supplies and materials. The IAR, 

RIS, RSMI, PO and DR serve as the original sources of information 

for making entries on the card.  

d. Requisition and Issue Slip (Appendix 63) – shall be used by the end-

user to request issue of supplies and materials that are carried on 

stock. It is also used by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit 

to indicate availability or non-availability of items requisitioned 

and/or to record issues of item/s requisitioned.   

e. xxx 

f. xxx 

g. Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (Appendix 64) – shall be 

prepared by the Property and/or Supply Custodian based on the 

RIS and shall be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in 

preparing the JEV to record the supplies and materials issued. x 

xx” 

 

1.4. For check and balance, the balance in quantity per SC should always reconcile 
with the SLCs of the Accounting Office. 

 

1.5. Comparison between the balance of the Office Supplies Inventory account in 
the General Ledger (GL) and the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories 

(RPCI) as of December 31, 2020 revealed a difference of ₱12,447.66, as 

shown below: 

 

Account Balance Per GL 
Per Inventory Report 

as of December, 2020 
Discrepancy 

Office Supplies Inventory ₱130,118.30 ₱117,670.64 ₱12,447.66 

 

1.6. Causes of the discrepancy in the respective Accounting and Supply records 
could not be determined due to the following deficiencies, which rendered the 

completeness and existence of the account balance doubtful, to wit: 

 

a) Failure to maintain and update regularly the SC by the Supply Officer 
and SLC by the Accounting Unit; 

 

b) The JEVs issued as basis of the Accounting Office in recording of office 
supplies issued were not supported with RIS along with the RSMI 

prepared by the Supply Officer; and 

 

c) Non-reconciliation of the records of the Supply Officer with the 
Accounting Unit in order to come up with a reliable balance of the Office 

Supplies Inventory account in the financial statements (FS). 

 



26 
 

1.7. These cited deficiencies in the administration of the inventories imply a 
weakness in the internal control system. Also, the non-maintenance of 

accurate and reliable SC and SLC exposes the inventories to undetected 

misuse or loss.  

 
1.8. We recommended strict adherence to applicable provisions of the 

aforesaid Manual and the Management agreed to require:  
 

a. the Accounting Unit, in coordination with the Supply Officer, 
determine the causes of the discrepancy of ₱12,447.66 and make the 

necessary adjustments in order to reconcile the balances in the 

RPCI and in the books of accounts; 
 

b. the Property and Accounting Units to properly maintain their 
respective records and to regularly reconcile their inventory per 

books and per count; and 
 

c. the Supply Officer to regularly submit to the Accounting Unit the 
RSMI with duly signed RIS/ICS by the end users for proper 

recording in the books. 
  

Management Comments: 

 

1.9. The Accounting Unit had already maintained SLCs as of December 31, 2020 
and assured the monthly submission of the corresponding JEVs with the 

required supporting documents to the Auditing Office.  As of January 2021, 

the Property Unit is starting to prepare the SC for the Office Supplies 

Inventory account and the Management already required the Supply Officer 

to regularly submit to the Accounting Unit the duly signed RSMI/ICS for 

proper recording in the books. Further, regular reconciliation of the Office 

Supplies Inventory will be done by the Accounting and Property Units to 

determine discrepancy, if there is any, and to make the necessary adjustments 

in the books of accounts. 

 

Unreliable Property, Plant and Equipment accounts 

 

2. The year-end balance of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts 
amounting to ₱1,630,561.34 of the Agency is unreliable due to continued non-

adherence with the pertinent provisions of Chapter 10, GAM for NGAs, Vol. 1 

and Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020, 

as follows: (a) non-maintenance of PPE Ledger Cards (PPELC) and Property 

Cards (PC) that support the PPE balances; (b) misclassification of semi-

expandable properties under PPE with an aggregate amount of ₱124,607.50; 

and (c) unreconciled reporting difference of ₱718,844.62 between the 

Accounting books and Property records. 

 



27 
 

2.1. Section 3, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I laid the criteria for 
recognition of PPE, which states that the “cost of item of PPE shall be 

recognized if and only if: 

 

a) It is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential 
associated with the item will flow to the entity; 

b) The cost or fair market value of the item can be measured reliably; 
c) Beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the 

managements; 

d) The asset is used to achieve government objectives; and  
e) It meets the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00.” 

 

2.2. While, Section 40 states that:  
 

“All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and 

Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP).  PPE reported 

in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment 

Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less 

Accumulated Depreciation)” 

 

2.3. Likewise, Section 42 on Accounting and Property records to be maintained 
for PPE provides that: 

 

“The Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category 

of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc.  The PPELC 

shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, 

estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and 

other information about the asset.  For check and balance, the 

Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain Property 

Card for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and 

disposition of the same.  The balance per PC shall be reconciled with 

PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit.  They shall also 

be reconciled with other property records like Property 

Acknowledgment Receipt (PAR)”. 

 

2.4. The same Section of the Manual also states, among others, the following 
reports necessary to account for the PPE: 

 

“PC shall be used by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to 

record the description, acquisition, transfer, disposal and other 

information about the PPE. It shall be kept for each class of PPE. It 

shall be maintained by fund cluster. 

 

The Report on the Physical Count for Property, Plant and Equipment 

(RPCPPE) shall be reconciled with the PCs every year and any 

discrepancies should be immediately verified and adjusted. 



28 
 

RPCPPE shall be used to report the physical count and condition of 

PPE by type as at a given date, including those which are unrecorded 

and those which could not be accounted for. It shows the balance of 

PPE per property cards and per count and the shortage/overage, if 

any.  It shall be rendered by the Inventory Committee, on its yearly 

physical count of properties owned by the entity.  

It shall be prepared yearly by fund Cluster. It shall be submitted to the 

Auditor concerned and Accounting Division/Unit not later than 

January 31 of each year.” 

 

2.5. Relatively, Section 10, Chapter 8 of the same Manual provides the following 
guidelines: 

 

“Sec. 10. Semi-expendable Property. Tangible items below the 

capitalization threshold of ₱15,000 shall be accounted as semi-

expendable property. The following policies apply as follows: 

a. Semi-expendable property which were recognized as PPE shall be 
reclassified to the affected accounts. 

 

b. These tangible items shall be recognized as expense upon issue to 
the end-user.” 

 

2.6. The GAM for NGAs, Volume I further provides that properties below the 
₱15,000.00 threshold should be reported as semi-expendable property and 

recognized as expense upon issuance to the end-user. However, Inventory 

Custodian Slip (ICS) shall be issued to the end-user of Semi-Expendable 

Property to establish accountability over them. Accountability shall be 

extinguished upon return of the item to the Property and Supply Division/Unit 

or in case of loss, upon approval of the relief from property accountability. 

 

2.7. On the other hand, COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 
further prescribes the guidelines and procedures on the inventory-taking, 

recognition of those found at station and disposition for non-existing/ missing 

PPE items for the one-time cleansing of PPE accounts of government agencies 

to establish PPE balances that are verifiable as to existence, condition and 

accountability.  

 

2.8. Audit of this account with carrying amount of ₱1,630,561.34 disclosed the 
following deficiencies affecting the fair presentation thereof, such as:  

 

a. There was non-adherence with the government accounting rules in the 
preparation and maintenance of PPELC for each class/type of PPE for the 

items acquired during the year, and those in prior years. Likewise, the 

Supply Officer failed to maintain the PC for each class/type of PPE. With 

this setup, reconciliation of property records is not possible. 



29 
 

b. Items that are below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 in the total 
amount of ₱124,607.50 are still classified under the PPE accounts instead 

of Semi-expendables. This error in recording and classification of 

accounts is contrary to the afore-cited provisions of GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I, to wit: 

 

Affected Accounts Description Qty. Unit Cost 
Over/(Under) 

Statement 

Furniture & Fixtures Executive Chair 7 ₱4,687.50 ₱32,812.50 

Furniture & Fixtures Conference Chair  6 3,800.00 22,800.00

Projector  

2 9,497.50 18,995.00 

Total ₱38,185.00 ₱124,607.50 

 

c. Inability of the Accounting and Property Units personnel to reconcile the 
reported difference of ₱718,844.62 between the Accounting and Property 

records/RPCPPE is contrary to Section 48, Chapter 10, of GAM for 

NGAs, Volume I.  Analysis of unreconciled discrepancies is shown as 

follows: 

 

Balance per Books 

12/31/2020 

Balance per 

RPCPPE 

12/31/2020 

Unreconciled 

Amount 

₱4,242,058.44  ₱3,523,213.82 ₱718,844.62 

 

2.9. Verification disclosed that these discrepancies are mainly attributed to:                  
(1) the inclusion of the PPE items in RPCPPE but not in the SL, and vice-

versa; and (2) unserviceable PPE items with total cost of ₱413,153.00 not yet 

dropped from the books as of December 31, 2020,  contrary to  Section 40, 

Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

2.10. In addition, it was also noted that the Property Number of each PPE item, as 
indicated in the submitted RPCPPE, was not in accordance with the property 

identification system for PPE as required under Section 5 of COA Circular 

No. 2020-006, to wit:

PPE sub-major account group 

 

General Ledger account 

 

Serial number (one series per PPE category/type/location 

 

Location/Office 

 
Additional digits may be used for serial number and location/office, as necessary. 

 

2.11. Also, despite the previous advice to Management, the Audit Team was not 
notified on the conduct of the physical inventory-taking, hence it was 

undertaken in the absence of a COA representative, contrary to            Section 

5.4 of the same COA Circular, stating that: “The entire inventory taking shall 
be witnessed by the COA Auditor. The Audit Team Leader and/or any of 

his/her audit team members may be assigned for the purpose.”  

 

2.12. The Accountant and the Supply Officer commented that the inventory- taking 
was not intentionally done without the presence of COA but was mistakenly 

overlooked. Further, they admittedly confirmed that no reconciliation of 

records was done to support the accuracy of the reported balances in the 

required Accounting and Property records as discussed above.  

 

2.13. The lapses in complying with the required procedures, reports, and records 
concerning the Agency’s PPE account cast doubt on the correctness and 

existence of the said assets as reflected in the year-end FSs. 

 

2.14. We reiterated our recommendations to Management to:  
 

a. direct the concerned officers to maintain and update the PPELC and 
PC and reconcile both records, as prescribed under the GAM for 

NGAs, Volume I to facilitate adjustment of the discrepancy of 

₱718,844.62 and reflect the correct balance of the PPE account;  
 

b. instruct the Accountant to reclassify all PPE items costing below the 
capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 to the appropriate Inventories 

accounts. For items that had been issued to end-users, debit the 

appropriate Expenses account and for monitoring of accountability, 

the issuances thereof should be covered by ICS; and 
 



31 
 

c. strictly observe the uniform property identification system for PPE 
as required under Section 5 of COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated 

January 31, 2020. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

2.15. As of January 2021, the concerned officers have started to maintain the 
PPELC and PC as prescribed under the GAM, and they were directed to 

conduct regular reconciliation of Accounting and Property records to facilitate 

adjustments of discrepancies or make the necessary corrections if needed. 

Further, the Head of the Agency had already instructed the Accountant to 

prepare the necessary reclassification entry under Inventories accounts of the 

Semi-expendables with the total amount of ₱124,607.50 which were included 

in the PPE account balance. 

 

 

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 

Claims/Payments of Representation Allowance and Transportation Allowance not 

adequately supported with documents 

 

3. Grant of Representation Allowance and Transportation Allowance (RATA) 
totaling ₱140,896.56 to the Head of the Agency of NCCT was not supported with 

complete documentations, contrary to Section 4 (6) of Presidential Decree (PD) 

No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-01 dated June 14, 2012, casting doubts as 

to the propriety of the payment of the said allowances.  

 

3.1. Section 54 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, or the General 
Appropriations Act (GAA) for Calendar Year (CY) 2020 reads as follows: 

 

“The transportation allowance, whether in full or partial amounts, 

authorized herein shall not be granted to officials who are assigned 

or actually using government motor transportation.”  

 

3.2. Provided that officials who are assigned government motor transportation, but 
are not able to use said vehicle for justifiable reasons, as determined by the 

DBM, may be granted transportation allowance on the said period. 

 

3.3. The DBM shall determine other officials in the government that are of 
equivalent ranks with the above-cited officials who may likewise be entitled 

to RATA. 

 

3.4. Similarly, Section   4(6) of PD No. 1445 provides that “Claims against 
government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.”  

 



32 
 

3.5. While item 5.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 provides 
the documentary requirements for the payment of RATA, to wit: 

Documentary Requirements 

 

 For individual Claims 
o Copy of Office Order/Appointment (1st payment) 
o Certificate of Assumption (1st payment) 
o Certification that the official/employee did not use government vehicle 

and is not assigned any government vehicle 

o Certificate or evidence of service rendered or approved Daily Time 
Record (DTR) 

o Certification by the LCE, xxx 
 

3.6. Post-audit of the following transactions covering the period January 1 to 
December 31, 2020 revealed that payments for RATA with a total amount of 

₱140,896.56 were not supported with a Certification that the 

official/employee did not use government vehicle or is not assigned any 

government vehicle and Certificate of evidence of service rendered or 

approved Daily Time Record (DTR). A General Payroll was the only 

document attached to the Disbursement Vouchers (DVs).  Details are as 

follows:

Total   ₱97,448.28 ₱43,448.28 ₱140,896.56 

 

3.7. Moreover, for the months of March to June 2020, TA wase claimed by the 
Head of the Agency despite the assignment of motor vehicle under her name, 

as evidenced by the Unnumbered Memorandum dated February 28, 2020 

issued by the designated Property Custodian.  

 

3.8. It may be recalled that for the period March 16 to May 31, 2020, the entire 
Metro Manila was under Modified/Enhanced Community Quarantine 

(M/ECQ) due to COVID-19 Pandemic, as declared by President Duterte and 

the government is lenient in the physical attendance to work. 

 



33 
 

3.9. Thus, the Audit Team made verbal inquiry with the concerned official of the 
DBM for clarification on the stated item (a) in Section 54 of the General 

Provisions of the GAA for CY 2020, which states that “Officials who are 

assigned government motor transportation, but are not able to use said 

vehicle for justifiable reason, as determined by the DBM, may be granted 

transportation allowance during the said period.” (Emphasis ours). In 

response, they clarified that claims during M/ECQ, including on General 

Community Quarantine (GCQ), would not be allowed for those Officials 

which have been assigned motor vehicle for the reason that they can use the 

vehicle issued anytime at their disposal for the exigency of work.  

 

3.10. The inability to prepare and submit the required certifications in the payment 
of TA cast doubts on the propriety and regularity of the said payment.  

 

3.11. However, the TA claimed for the four months’ period can be considered 
provided that the NCCT official concerned with assigned government motor 

vehicle could prove that she did not use the assigned vehicle in the discharge 

of his functions.  

 

3.12. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. immediately submit the required certification that the concerned 
officer did not use government vehicle and the proof of service 

rendered; and 

 

b. refrain from granting Transportation Allowance to 
officials/employees who are assigned or presently use government 

motor vehicle even under the M/ECQ or GCQ. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

3.13. The Accountant has refrained from granting TA to the Head of the Agency 
since the latter was assigned with official motor vehicle. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

3.14. The submitted documents are found in order and strict compliance with 
Section 4 (6) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 

2012-01 dated June 14, 2012 on granting of RATA is unyielding. 

 

Disbursements not adequately supported with required documents 

 

4. Disbursements totaling ₱4,273,614.05 were found not duly supported with basic 
documentary requirements contrary to Sections 4.6 of PD No. 1445 and COA 

Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, thus the validity of claims and 

propriety of the transactions cannot be ascertained. 



34 
 

4.1. COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 was issued to prescribe the 
revised documentary requirements for common government transactions.  

 

4.2. Post-audit of transactions for CY 2020 disclosed that disbursements totaling 
₱4,273,614.05 were paid even with incomplete documentation, to wit:

4.3. In view of the inadequacy of required supporting documents of the paid 
claims, the validity and propriety of the aforementioned transactions cannot 

be ascertained. 

 

4.4. We reiterated the prior year’s recommendations that Management 
submit immediately the required supporting document listed in the table 

in paragraph 4.2, otherwise, the non-submission thereof would 

necessitate the issuance of Notice of Suspension.   

 

Management Comments: 

 

4.5. In compliance with COA Circular 2012-001, Management ensured the 
completeness of the required documents on the succeeding claims. The 

submission of the required documents, as mentioned, will be delivered to 

COA’s Office as soon as possible. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

4.6. Considering that the submission of incomplete required supporting 
documents is already a common yearly audit observation, attention is invited 

to Sec. 39 of PD No. 1445, to wit: 

 

“Section 39. Submission of papers relative to government obligations.  

1.  x  x  x 

2.  x x x 

3. It shall be the duty of the officials or employees concerned including 

those in non-government entities under audit, or affected in the audit 

of government and non-government entities, to comply promptly with 

these requirements. Failure or refusal to do so without justifiable 

cause shall constitute a ground for administrative disciplinary action 

x x x.”  

Non-compliance with the Procurement Law or RA No. 9184  

 

5. Information and technology (IT) equipment amounting to ₱716,067.00 were 
procured through Small Value Procurement – Shopping without 

quotations/canvass from at least three suppliers, contrary to pertinent 

provisions of Section 52 of 2016 Revised IRR of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184. 

Further, the same was not posted in the Philippine Government Electronic 

Procurement System (PhilGEPS) website as required under Section 21.2.1 of the 



39 
 

same IRR; hence, these procedural lapses did not assure that the most 

advantageous price for these items was obtained by the Agency. 

 

5.1. Section 7, Volume I, on Guidelines on the Establishment of Procurement 
Systems and Organizations, states that “All Procuring Entities shall utilize 

PhilGEPS, through its Electronic Catalogue facility, for the procurement of 

common-use supplies.  Moreover, all Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to 

Bid (IAEB), notices of award, and all other procurement-related notices shall 

be posted in the PhilGEPS, regardless of the method of procurement used by 

the Procuring Entity. 

 

The Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) shall issue the 

necessary procedural guidelines covering procurement through the 

PhilGEPS.  It shall have a centralized electronic bulletin 

board.  Procuring Entities are required to post the following in the 

PhilGEPS Electronic Bulletin Board: 

 

1. IAEB for competitive bidding and notices of other procurement 
opportunities using the alternative methods of procurement; 

2. Supplemental/Bid bulletins 

3. Contract awards, the corresponding Notices of Award, including 
the reasons for award of contract; 

4. Results of bidding and related information; and 

5. Other notices, announcements, information for interested parties. 

 

Failure to post a procurement opportunity will render the resulting 

contract null and void.  Failure to post a Notice of Award shall render 

the erring government official/s administratively liable in accordance 

with RA No. 6713 and other pertinent laws, rules and regulations, and 

appropriate sanctions shall be imposed.” 

 

5.2. In addition, advertising and posting the IAEB shall follow the guidelines as 
prescribed under Section 21.2 of the same IRR, to wit: 

 
21.2.  “Except as otherwise provided in Section 54.2 of this IRR and 

for the procurement of common-use goods and supplies, the 

Invitation to Bid/Request for Expression of Interest shall be:  

  

a)   Posted at any conspicuous place reserved for this purpose 

in the premises of the Procuring Entity concerned for seven 

calendar days as certified by the head of the Bids and 

Awards Committee (BAC) Secretariat of the Procuring 

Entity concerned; and  

  

b)  Posted continuously in the PhilGEPS website, the website of 

the Procuring Entity concerned, if available, and the 



40 
 

website prescribed by the foreign government/foreign or 

international financing institution, if applicable, for seven 

calendar days starting on date of advertisement.”  

 

5.3. On the other hand, Section 52 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 
defines Shopping as a method of procurement of goods whereby the Procuring 

Entity simply requests for the submission of price quotations for readily 

available off-the-shelf goods or ordinary/regular equipment to be procured 

directly from suppliers of known qualifications. This method of procurement 

shall be employed only in any of the following cases: 

 

a) “When there is an unforeseen contingency requiring immediate 
purchase: Provided, however, That the amount shall not exceed 

Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (₱200,000.00); or 

 

b) Procurement of ordinary or regular office supplies and equipment 
not available in the Procurement Service involving an amount not 

exceeding One Million Pesos (₱1,000,000.00): Provided, however, 

that the procurement does not result in splitting of contracts, as 

provided in Section 54.1 of this IRR-A: Provided, further, that at 

least three (3) price quotations from bona fide suppliers shall be 

obtained.” (Emphasis ours) 

 

5.4. For CY 2020, the NCCT had a total procurement of ₱716,067.00 for IT 
equipment, as follows: 

 

Check No./Date Payee Amount 
427827 dated 

September 25, 2020 

One Mall'O Poly World - SM 

Megamall 

₱388,545.00 

427840 dated 

September 30, 2020 

One Mall'O Poly World - SM 

Megamall 

327,522.00 

Total  ₱716,067.00 

 

5.5. Both transactions were sourced from the same supplier but were purchased 
separately with a five-day interval. The procurements were above the 

threshold of ₱200,000.00, contrary to Section 52(a.i) of IRR of RA No. 9184, 

which states that “When there is an unforeseen contingency requiring 

immediate purchase, the amount shall not exceed Two Hundred Thousand 

Pesos (₱200,000.00),”. Section 52(b) of the same IRR, on the other hand, 

provides that when procurement of ordinary or regular office supplies and 

equipment is not available in the Department of Budget and Management – 

Procurement Service (DBM-PS) shall not exceed One Million Pesos 

(₱1,000,000.00). However, the same was not evidenced by a Certificate of 

Non-Availability from DBM-PS, thus non-adhering to the latter provision.  

 

5.6. Per online inquiry with the Executive Director, she justified the procurement 
of office equipment such as laptop computer, printer and allied equipment 



41 
 

hurriedly bought from One Mall'O Poly World - SM Megamall thru Small 

Value Procurement-Shopping because all the 18 NCCT personnel including 

the incoming new hired personnel have to do work-from-home arrangement 

due to COVID19 Pandemic situation. 

  

5.7. Furthermore, separate procurement from the same supplier would be 
considered splitting if not in accordance with the provisions of Emergency 

Procurement under RA No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act under 

issued Non-Policy Matter (NPM) No. 004-2020 dated April 16,2020 by 

GPPB-Technical Support Office (TSO), to wit: 

 

Special Repeat Order  

 

Another important feature of the Circular is the authority given to PEs 

to make a Special Repeat Order in consideration of the urgent 

necessity of the items to be procured, difficulty in accurately 

estimating the quantity needed, and the limited funds available at the 

time of original purchase.  

Accordingly, PEs are given the option to avail of a Special Repeat 

Order under the following conditions: 

a. Limited to Goods covered under the Bayanihan Act and reiterated 
in Item 2.2 of the Circular; 

b.  The Goods were procured under a contract previously awarded 
through any mode of procurement, provided that the Notice of 

Award (NOA) was issued within the last six months;  

c. The unit prices must be the same or lower than those in the 
original contract. In the case of same unit price, the PE must 

ensure that there is no lower price available in the market; and 

d. There has been a partial delivery, inspection and acceptance of 
the goods under a contract previously awarded; and  

e. The total amount shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of 
the original contract. (Item 8.1 of GPPB Circular No. 01-2020). 

5.8. Verification further revealed that the Management did not prepare the Request 
for Quotation (RFQ) to at least three suppliers, in violation of Sections 52 and 

53.10 of the revised IRR of RA No. 9184. Had all procurements, including 

foreseeable emergencies, been meticulously and judiciously planned, the 

Agency could have procured these items in bulk purchases, and availed of a 

better price that is more advantageous to the government. Moreover, it was 

also disclosed that the NCCT failed to post the abovementioned information 

in the PhilGEPS Electronic Bulletin Board as required in Section 21.2 of the 

same IRR. 



42 
 

5.9. We recommended that Management strictly adhere to the provisions of 
RA No. 9184 and its IRR to ensure that the most advantageous price will 

be obtained by the government in all its purchases and procure common-

use supplies and equipment from the DBM-PS, and if not available, the 

purchase thereof from private suppliers should be supported by a 

Certificate of Non-Availability of Stocks. 

 
Compliance with the Transparency Seal 

6. Transparency in governance was not fully assured by the  NCCT when the 
posting and updating of the information on donations, trust receipts, public 

funds, audit, financial  and physical reports, as well as the required 

‘Transparency Seal’ in its official website have not been completely undertaken 

as mandated under Sections  89 to 92 and 94 of the General Provisions (GP), 

GAA for FY 2020 or RA No. 11465; thus, depriving the public of pertinent 

information necessary to enforce accountability among its officials and affected 

the Agency’s eligibility for Performance-Based Bonus (PBB) in CY 2020 due to 

non-compliance with the good governance conditions required under 

Memorandum Circular No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 2020. 

 

6.1. Pertinent provisions in the GAA of FY 2020 or RA No. 11465 to enhance 
transparency and accountability in the government, among others, are the 

following: 

 

Section 89. Report on Commission on Audit Findings and 

Recommendations. “Within sixty (60) days from receipt of the COA 

Annual Audit Report, agencies concerned shall submit to the COA, 

either in printed form or by way of electronic document, a status 

report on the actions taken on said audit findings and 

recommendations using the prescribed form under COA 

Memorandum No. 2014-002 dated March 18, 2014. They shall 

likewise furnish the DBM, the Speaker of the House of 

Representatives, the President of the Senate of the Philippines, the 

House Committee on Appropriations, and the Senate Committee on 

Finance, either in printed form or by way of electronic document, a 

copy of said reports. 

 

The heads of agencies and the agencies’ web administrator or their 

equivalent shall be responsible for ensuring that said status reports 

are likewise posted in their respective websites.” (Emphasis supplied) 

 

Section 90. Financial Reports. “On or before the tenth (10th) day of 

the month immediately following the covered period, departments, 

bureaus, offices and instrumentalities of the National Government, 

including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and State 

Universities and Colleges (SUCs), shall submit the monthly report on 

appropriations, allotments, obligations and disbursements of current 



43 
 

appropriations, as well as the monthly report of disbursement, 

through the following: a) URS or other electronic means for reports 

not covered by the URS; and b) Agency’s website. 

 

Section 91.  Financial and Physical Reports. “Within thirty (30) days 

after the end of each quarter, departments, bureaus, offices and 

instrumentalities of the National Government, including 

Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs, shall 

submit the quarterly reports on its financial and physical 

accomplishments as well as reports and other information mandated 

in the special and general provisions of this Act, through the 

following: a) URS or other electronic means for reports not covered 

by the URS; and b) Agency’s website. 

 

Section 92. Submission of Post 2020 Budget Status. “The DBM shall 

submit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President 

of the Senate of the Philippines, the House Committee on 

Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Finance a post 2020 

budget status report not later than May 31, 2021. This report shall 

indicate a brief accomplishment on all programs, activities, and 

project of agencies of the government as reflected in this Act and 

including specific activities or projects funded from lump-sum 

appropriations and special purpose funds. 

 

The DBM shall post the said report on its website. The heads of the 

agencies and agency’s web administrators or their equivalent shall be 

responsible for ensuring that the portion of the status pertinent to them 

are likewise posted on their respected websites. 

Section 94. Transparency Seal. “To enhance transparency and 

enforce accountability, all agencies of the government shall maintain 

a Transparency Seal to be posted on their websites. The Transparency 

Seal shall contain the following information: (i) the agency’s 

mandates and functions, names of its officials with their position and 

designation, and contact information; (ii) approved budgets and 
corresponding targets, immediately upon approval of this Act; (iii) 

modifications made pursuant to the general and special provisions in 

this Act; (iv) annual procurement plan/s and contracts awarded with 

the winning supplier, contractor or consultant; (v) major activities or 

projects categorized in accordance with the 0+10 point socio 

economic agenda and their target beneficiaries;   (vi) status of 

implementation, evaluation or assessment reports of said programs or 

projects; (vii) Budget and Financial Accountability Reports; (viii) 

People’s Freedom of Information (FOI) Manual signed  by head of 

agency, Agency Information Inventory, 2018 and 2019 Freedom of 

Information (FOI) Summary Report, and 2018 and 2019 FOI 



44 
 

Registry; and (ix) annual reports on the status of income authorized 

by law to be retained and/or used and be deposited outside of the 

National Treasury, which shall include the legal basis for its retention 

and/or use, the beginning balance, income collected and its sources, 

expenditures, and ending balance for the preceding fiscal year. 

The heads of the agencies and their web administrators or their 

equivalent shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with this 

section.” 

6.2. Likewise, Section 3.15 of the National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated 
January 6, 2020, states that “All Departments/Agencies are required to 

implement the transparency provisions in the FY 2020 (General Provision 

Nos. 11, 93, and 94) and Executive Order (EO) No. 2, s. 2016 

(Operationalizing in the Executive Branch the People’s Constitutional Right 

to Information and the State Policies to Full Public Disclosure and 

Transparency in the Public Service and Providing Guidelines Therefor). 

 

6.3. Further, Section 4 of Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 
2020 issued by Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on the Harmonization of 

National Government Performance Monitoring, Information and Reporting 

Systems on Guidelines on the Grant of the PBB for Fiscal Year 2020 under 

EO No. 80 s. 2012 and EO No. 201 s. 2016, likewise provides the Good 

Governance Conditions (GCGs) based on performance drivers of the Results-

Based Performance Management System (RBPMS) and the priorities of the 

Duterte Administration for       1) heightened transparency; 2) stronger public 

accountability; and 3) more inclusive and people-centered public service, as 

one of the conditions to be eligible for the grant of PBB. Among these is the 

maintenance/update of the Agency Transparency Seal under Section 94 of the 

General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA.   

 

6.4. Ideally, the Transparency Seal summarizes all the needed data in the nine 
identified components as prescribed in the current budget Act. It is depicted 

by a pearl shining out of an open shell, which is a symbol of a policy shift 

towards openness in access to government information. It hopes to inspire 

Filipinos in the civil service to be more open to citizen engagement; on the 

other hand, it invites the citizenry to exercise their right to participate in 

governance. This initiative is envisioned as a step in the right direction 

towards solidifying the position of the country as a shining example for 

democratic virtue in the region. 
 

6.5. Verification of the Agency’s official website www.ncct.gov.ph showed that 
the following minimum requirements are either not complied or partially 

complied, as follows:

6.6. Consequently, non-compliance with good governance conditions required by 
Memorandum Circular No. 2018-1 dated May 28, 2018 issued by the Inter-

Agency Task Force on the Harmonization of National Government 

Performance Monitoring, Information and Reporting Systems may affect the 

Agency’s eligibility for PBB. 

 

6.7. The sole purpose of sharing the government information to the public is to 
enhance transparency and enforce accountability on all national government 

agencies. The public should be informed and not be deprived of government 

information on transactions which may involve or benefit them.  
 

6.8. Similarly, the need to employ these available digital platforms is more fitting 
nowadays due to the challenges brought in by the Pandemic, where restriction 

of movement is imposed across the country.   Making use of the advances 

provided by this website to communicate the important information is now 

the new norm that is unparalleled and paramount under these circumstances. 

 

 

 



47 
 

6.9. We reiterate our recommendation that the Management: 
 

a. comply strictly with Sections 89, 90, 91, and 94 of the General 
Provisions of the GAA of 2020 or RA No. 11465 and Section 4 of 

Memorandum Circular No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 2020 issued by 

IATF on the Harmonization of National Government Performance 

Monitoring, Information and Reporting Systems; and 

 

b. ensure that the Agency’s available information technology resources 
are utilized to make certain that the transparency and accountability 

of its operational and financial affairs are strictly implemented.  

 

Management Comments: 

 

6.10. The Agency commits to strictly comply with the aforementioned provisions 
mandating transparency and accountability.  And, as of March 29, 2021, the 

website administrator updated the website and uploaded the approved budget 

for 2020 and 2021, annual reports, revised implementing rules and regulations 

of the RA No. 8370, names of officials, and the Agency’s mandate, vision, 

mission, and goal. 

 

 

OTHER COMPLIANCE 
 

Budget Utilization 

 

7. The NCCT had incurred a total overdraft of ₱2,997,246.76 from its actual 
expenditures for Personnel Services (PS), and an unobligated allotment of 

₱536,465.73 from its Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) 

during the year; thereby, exceeding a total of ₱2,460,781.03 from its current 

year’s allotment, contrary to Section 41, Chapter 5, Book VI of EO No. 292 and 

Section 38, Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

Moreover, a total of ₱923,831.54 from MOOE had been expended for 

procurements of PPE, such as IT Equipment and Office Equipment in the 

amounts of ₱748,332.00, and ₱175,499.54, respectively, in the absence of 

current year’s appropriations for Capital Outlay (CO), contrary to NBC No. 

578 dated January 6, 2020, and Section 70 of General Provisions of GAA for 

FY 2020. 

 

7.1. In general, a government budget is the financial plan of the government for a 
given period, usually for a fiscal year, which shows what its resources are, 

and how they will be generated and used over the fiscal period. The budget is 

the government’s key instrument for promoting its socio-economic 

objectives. The government budget also refers to the income, expenditures 



48 
 

and sources of borrowings of the National Government (NG) that are used to 

achieve national objectives, strategies and programs.    

 

7.2. Under the NBC No. 578 dated January 6, 2020, all departments, agencies and 
operating units (OUs) of the National Government Agencies as a general rule 

shall spend what is programmed in their respective appropriations. It highly 

encouraged, among others, the full budget utilization of each agencies and 

provides for the following guidelines on the release of funds for FY 2020, to 

wit:  

 

1.0 Purpose 
 

1.1 To provide policies, procedures, rules and regulations on the 
release, utilization of funds, and monitoring of items authorized 

under RA No. 11465, the FY 2020 GAA, in accordance with the 

General and Specific Provisions, thereof. 

 

1.2 To synchronize fund release with the implementation of the 
overall physical and financial plans, targets and schedules 

submitted by the departments, agencies, and/or OUs. 

 

1.3 To institutionalize a simplified, streamlined monitoring and 
evaluation of performance information through the required 

budgetary reports. 

 

7.3. On the other hand, Book VI, Chapter 5, Section 41 of EO No. 292 as stated in 
Section 38 of Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that,” Heads 

of Departments, bureaus, offices and agencies shall not incur nor authorize 

incurrence of expenditures or obligations in excess of allotment released by 

the DBM Secretary for their respective departments, offices and agencies. 

Parties responsible for the incurrence of overdrafts shall be held personally 

liable therefor. (Emphasis ours) 

 

7.4. In CY 2020, the Agency received a total allotment of ₱17,829,000.00 with 
automatic appropriations of ₱279,000.00 for Retirement and Life Insurance 

Premiums (RLIP) from Specific Budget of National Government Agencies, 

however, due to the Pandemic and in line with NBC No. 580 dated April 22, 

2020 re: adaptation of economic measures in the government due to the 

emergency health situation, budget has been modified down to 

₱11,869,000.00, as help to partially generate the required amounts to 

implement the national policy in addressing the COVID-19 situation, details

7.6. Review of the reports submitted by the Accounting and Budget Officer shows: 
 

a. Overdraft of ₱2,997,246.76 from Personnel Services (PS) allotment  
 

7.7. The total appropriated budget for CY 2020 of NCCT for its PS amounted to 
₱3,277,000.00. The comparative presentation of NCCT’s actual PS for 

current years’ as against the Approved Budget is shown as follows:

7.8. Our audit disclosed that the negative variance in PS accounts, such as Salaries 
and Wages, PERA, Clothing and Uniform Allowance, Mid-Year and Year-

End Bonus, Cash Gift and PEI, was due to: (1) Salary adjustments on the base 

pay of plantilla personnel based on the step increment and promotion of the 

Executive Director; and (2) Inclusion of newly hired personnel to the bonuses 

for which they are entitled to. 

 

7.9. Moreover, there were expenditures charged to PS – Salaries and Wages 
without separate appropriations per object of expenditures, as follows: 

 

a. Payment of Representation Allowance (RA) of ₱97,448.28 and 
Transportation Allowance (TA) of ₱43,448.28; 

 

b. Payment of Loyalty Award of ₱10,000.00; and 

 

c. Payment for monetization of leave in the total amount of ₱310,373.37. 
The Agency may submit a special budget request to DBM for the release 

of funds for monetization of leave credits, chargeable against the Pension 

and Gratuity Fund (PGF), after exhausting all its available released PS 

allotment as provided under DBM Circular No. 2019-11 dated July 25, 

2019 and Section I of Special Provision(s) of GAA for 2020. 

 

7.10. Similarly, RLIP has a negative balance in allotment of ₱156,397.00. Per 
inquiry with the Bookkeeper, allotment had already been released with 

Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) to fill the deficit, however, it was 

not reflected in the budgetary reports and the Audit Team has not been 

furnished with the copies. 

 

 

 

 



51 
 

b. Unobligated MOOE allotment – ₱536,465.73 
 

7.11. Although there was a reduced allotment for current year MOOE of only 
P8,592.000.00, still, the Agency was not able to fully obligate the same. At 

yearend, there was an unobligated balance of ₱536,465.73 or equivalent to 

6.24% of the allotment resulting mainly from   unutilized Training Expenses 

of ₱802,222.53 and the overdraft in allotment for Transportation and Delivery 

Expenses of ₱332,547.30, details are as follows:

7.12. Nevertheless, on the positive note, the NCCT satisfactorily accomplished its 
plans and targets for the year achieving over 100 percent of their commitment 

of conducting 28 workshops, seminars, trainings and conferences as reported 

in their Quarterly Physical Report of Operations as of December 31, 2020 

despite having an underutilization rate of 6.24% of its MOOE, as shown

7.13. On the other hand, further examination revealed that purchase of PPEs, such 
as IT Equipment of ₱748,332.00 and Office Equipment of ₱175,499.50 or a 

total of ₱923,831.54 were charged from the MOOE, in violation to NBC No. 

578 and Section 70 of General Provisions of GAA for FY 2020, rendering the 

disbursements irregular. 

 

7.14. As a general rule, department, bureaus and offices of the National 
Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and 

SUCs shall spend what is programmed in their respective appropriations in 

the FY 2020 GAA. In exceptional circumstances, agencies may modify the 

allotment issued within an activity or project subject to approval of the 

following ensued by the timely submission of reports by all offices concerned: 

 

(a) The heads of agencies, for the following: (i) change in the details of an 
activity or project without changing its nature and within the same 

operating unit; and (ii) change in the object of expenditure (Travelling, or 

Investment Outlays) within an allotment class (MOOE, or Capital 

Outlays); 

 

(b) The DBM, in the following modifications: (1) from one allotment class 
to another; (ii) from one operating unit to another; (iii) within a special 

purpose fund; and (iv) for payment of Magna Carta benefits under 

Section 50 hereof; and 

 

(c) The President of the Philippines, for the payment of intelligence funds 
within the Executive Branch. 

 

 

 

 

 



53 
 

7.15. We recommended that Management:  
 

a. require the Budget Unit to closely monitor the utilization of funds to 
avoid incurring expenditures in excess of the budget and/or its 

underutilization;  

 

b. submit legal basis for incurring overdraft for the Personal Services 
allotment and for payment of PS expenditures without any 

appropriation, otherwise, the same will be disallowed in audit; and   

 

c. secure approval from the DBM for the realignment of ₱923,831.54 
from the MOOE allotment class to CO to prevent disallowance in 

audit and ensure that before its actual incurrence of obligation, funds 

are sufficient and available exclusively for the specific purpose for 

which they have been appropriated.   

 

Management Comments: 

 

7.16. All throughout CY 2020, Accounting and Budget Divisions were in constant 
communication and coordination with the NCCT’s DBM Analyst designated 

by their respective Office. On October 28, 2020, as advised by NCCT’s DBM 

Analyst, NCCT requested for the release of SARO for the FY 2020 PS 

deficiency. On December 21, 2020, DBM released a letter addressed to 

NCCT’s Executive Director Daisy Atienza stating that DBM acknowledges 

the PS deficiency and will work on the request on the first working day of 

2021. The Agency made sure that there were consultations and sought the 

insights of its DBM Analyst and acted accordingly. 

 

Non-compliance with Property Insurance Law 

 

8. Properties of NCCT with carrying amount of ₱1,630,561.34 were inadequately 
provided with insurance coverage due to the failure of Property Officer to 

submit the Property Inventory Form (PIF), which serves as basis for the 

assessment of general insurance coverage over all insurable assets, properties 

and interest of the government with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the 

Government Service Insurance System (GSIS),  contrary to Section 5 of RA No. 

656, otherwise known as the “Property Insurance Law” and COA Circular Nos. 

92-390 and 2018-002;  thus, posing risks of non-indemnification of insurable 

assets in case of damage or loss due to fire, earthquake, storm or other fortuitous 

events. 

 

8.1. Section 5 of RA No. 656, the Property Insurance Law, requires that:  
 

“Every government, except a municipal government below first class, 

is hereby required to insure its properties, with the Property 

Insurance Fund against any insurable risk herein provided and pay 



54 
 

the premiums thereon, which, however, shall not exceed the premiums 

charged by private insurance companies: Provided, However, that the 

System reserves the right to disapprove the whole or a portion of the 

amount of insurance applied for: Provided, further, that such property 

or part thereof as may not be insurable or acceptable for insurance 

may be insured with any private insurance company.  x x x.” 

 

8.2. Section 11 thereof further provides that each government shall include in its 
annual appropriation the amount necessary to cover the premiums for the 

insurance of its properties during each fiscal period for immediate remittance 

to the GSIS. 

 

8.3. COA Circular No. 92-390 November 17, 1992 was issued to assist the GIF 
and the Property Replacement Fund of the GSIS in: 

 

a. Determining the physical assets of the national and local government 
including those of government-owned and/or controlled corporations and 

their subsidiaries and affiliates; and 

 

b. Ensuring that all insurable assets and properties of the Government are 
adequately covered/insured with the GIF of the GSIS. 

 

8.4. Accordingly, the Circular provides that: 
 

a. All Heads of national agencies, local government units and government 
owned or controlled corporations shall be responsible for the preparation 

and submission of the inventory of all insurable physical assets using the 

prescribed forms marked Annex “A” and “B” of the Circular;  

 

b. The inventory undertaken every year thereafter shall be submitted not 
later than October 31 in the ensuing year to the GSIS; and 

 

c. The COA Auditor shall verify the correctness of the said inventory report. 
 

8.5. Similarly, COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 provides the 
guidelines prescribing the submission of the PIF not later than April 30 of 

each year. It sets out the guidelines requiring that the Head of Agency shall 

direct the pertinent official under his supervision to: 

 

a. Secure from GSIS GIF, all insurable or bonds; 
b. Prepare PIF listing of all insurable properties and other assets; 
c. Extract the data of the PIF from the Report on the Physical Count of PPE; 
d. Cause the appraisal of the insurable properties and other assets; 
e. Submit the consolidated PIF to this Commission and to GSIS not later 

than April 30 of each year; 



55 
 

f. Include in the agency annual budget the amount of premiums for the 
general insurance coverage; and 

g. Ensure centralized payment of insurance premium. 
 

8.6. Details of PPEs per book as of yearend are as follows: 
 

Particulars Amount 
Accumulated 

Depreciation 

Net Book 

Value 

Transportation Equipment* ₱1,183,624.00  ₱(843,332.12) ₱340,291.88

Software

Furniture and Fixtures 635,665.52 (529,849.63) 105,815.89 

Total ₱4,242,058.44 ₱(2,611,497.10) ₱1,630,561.34 
*PPE with insurance 

 

8.7. Out of the total insurable assets of ₱4,242,058.44 in CY 2020, only a 2015 
Toyota Innova 2.5E DSL Wagon costing ₱1,060,000.00 was insured with the 

GSIS, contrary to the abovementioned Circular. This is because it is pre-

requisite for Land Transportation Office (LTO) registration. This observation 

had already been communicated to the Supply Officer since his assumption 

to office in June 2020; however, the same has not yet been complied to date. 

 

8.8. Further, the RPCPPE, that is used as a basis in preparing the PIF, contains 
unreliable data. The report includes, among others, semi-expendable items 

such as executive and conference chairs, lateral and storage filing cabinet, and 

projectors, thus Management cannot proceed with the insurance of the 

Agency’s assets with GSIS. Moreover, the inability of the Management to 

provide annual provision necessary to cover the premiums for the insurance 

of its properties during the year has further showed its noncompliance with 

the Property Insurance Law. 

 

8.9. With the foregoing, the Agency’s failure to obtain insurance coverage denies 
the government an adequate and reliable protection against any damage to or 

loss of its properties and assets and interests due to fire, earthquake, storm, or 

other fortuitous events/casualty. 

 

8.10. Pertinent paragraphs under COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 
provides sanctions for non-compliance with Property Insurance Law. 

 

8.11. We reiterate our recommendation that the Management strictly comply 
with the requirements of Property Insurance Law by requiring all 

concerned officials: a) give preferential attention in insuring all insurable 

assets of the Agency; b) fast-track the preparation of Property Inventory 

Form to be submitted to this Commission and to GSIS within the set 



56 
 

deadline; and c) include in the yearly budget the appropriation for the 

insurance premiums of the insurable assets. 
 

Management Comments: 

 

8.12. The Budget Officer will coordinate with the Supply Officer for the insurance 
of the valuable assets and properties of the Agency and allot budget for such. 

Rest assured that the Agency will strictly comply with the Property Insurance 

Law once all the adjustments, including the removal of semi-expendable 

items in the RPCPPE and the proper adjusting entry in the books is done 

during the 1st Quarter of the current year. 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

9. NCCT failed to prepare and submit the adjusted GAD Plans and Budget (GPB) 
for CY 2020 and the corresponding GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) as 

required by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) Memorandum 

Circular No. 2020-03 dated April 27, 2020, and Section 8.2 of the PCW-National 

Economic and Development Authority (NEDA)- DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-

01; thus, the GAD related activities conducted cannot be ascertained if it 

completely addressed the identified gender issue of the Agency. 

 

9.1. Section 31 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, or the GAA for CY 
2020, reads as follows: 

   

“All agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed 

to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate 

and implement the applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 or the 

Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 

of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform of Action, the 

Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025), 

and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022). 

 

The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 

agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. 

For this purpose, activities currently undertaken by agencies which 

relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, 

economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, 

protection, promotion and fulfilment of women’s human rights, and 

practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient 

compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget 

shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators 

identified by said agencies.  

 

The preparation and submission of the annual GAD Plan and 

annual GAD Accomplishment Report shall be subject to the 

guidelines issued by the agencies concerned.” (Emphasis ours) 



57 
 

 

9.2. Section 8.2 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides 
that “the GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) shall submit the final GPB and the 

corresponding GAD AR to the PCW for review and endorsement to the 

DBM”; and Section 8.7 thereof requires agencies to “submit their PCW-

endorsed GPB to the DBM along with their annual GAD AR for the previous 

year in accordance with the budget call.” 

 

9.3. On the other hand, PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2020-3 dated April 27, 
2020 provides the guidelines on the revision and/or implementation of the FY 

2020 GPB to implement GAD Programs, Activities and Projects (PAPs) that 

address gender issues and concerns related to the COVID-19 situation, to wit: 

 

“4.1 All national government agencies and instrumentalities are 

enjoined to review and revise, as necessary, their FY 2020 GPB to 

implement measures to address gender issues and concerns arising 

from the unequal status of their women and men stakeholders due to 

the COVID-19 situation. Such measures should be in line with their 

respective agency mandates, RA No. 9710 or Magna Carta of Women 

and Bayanihan to Heal As One Act. Xxx 

 

4.2 The revision of the FY GPB should also be in line with the 

parameters set under National Budget Circular 580. GAD PAPs that 

fall under Section 4.3.1 of said policy shall be discontinued. 

 

4.3 The computation of the minimum five percent (5%) GAD budget 

as provided under Section 36(a) of the MCW shall be based on the 

total adjusted budget of the agency following the National Budget 

Circular No. 580. 

 

4.4 Agencies with FY 2020 GPB that has been endorsed or is still 

under review by PCW have an option to submit an adjusted GPB until 

01 July 2020 for (re-)endorsement of PCW. Requests to reopen the 

access to the agency’s FY 2020 GPB submitted through Gender 

Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) should be emailed to 

oed@pcw.gov.ph, copy furnished (cc) review.moderator@pcw.gov.ph 

and sysadmin@pcw.goc.ph. 

 

4.5 Agencies, whether with an endorsed or unendorsed GPB, shall 

reflect all changes made in the original FY 2020 GPB (e.g., 

cancellation/postponement of a GAD activity due to the Enhanced 

Community Quarantine or implementation of a new GAD activity to 

respond to the COVID-19 situation) in their GAD AR. Agencies shall 

also fill-out Column 10 of the GAD AR form to indicate deviations 

from the identified GAD activities and targets, if applicable.”

9.4. Audit of the implementation of GAD programs for CY 2020 revealed non-
compliance with the aforesaid requirements, to wit: 

 

a. The NCCT was not able to review and revise the PCW-endorsed GPB in 
line with RA No. 11469, otherwise known as “Bayanihan Act” and NBC 

No. 580, which requires 35% of the programmed appropriations under 

the FY 2020 GAA to be no longer made available for release and 10% 

discontinuance of the amounts released corresponding therein. Thus, the 

GAD budget of ₱1,100,000.00 was based on the original amount allotted 

to NCCT for CY 2020, or 6.17% thereto. Consequently, the PPAs 

discontinued per Bayanihan Act were still included in the GPB, such as 

Dialogue with the Content Creators, DokyuBata Video Documentary 

Contest, Capacity Building, thereby making the GPB unattainable; 

 

b. Failure to maximize and integrate GAD related programs/activities to its 
existing/regular Media Literacy Orientation Services (MLOS), allocating 

only ₱88,500.00 or 0.75% of its total adjusted appropriations of 

₱11,869,000.0, in violation of Section 2.3 and 6.1 PCW-NEDA-DBM JC 

No. 2012-01; and 

 

c. Non-submission of GAD Accomplishment Reports to the PCW together 
with the supporting schedules showing details of the actual cost or 

expenditures and documents that would established the propriety and 

accuracy of the GAD expenditures reported, as required under Section 

8.2 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01, within set 

deadline as prescribed under PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 

dated January 20, 2021. 

 

9.5. In view of the absence of the PCW re-endorsed adjusted GPB, the Audit Team 
has no basis in establishing whether the following GAD activities conducted 

during the year completely addressed the identified gender issues in NCCT 

within the set criteria of PCW:

9.6. With the foregoing discrepancies noted, the propriety and validity of the 
transactions cannot be ascertained, including whether these contributed to the 

full attainment of the GAD commitments, plans and policies. Hence, 

precludes the Audit Team in evaluating the utilization of NCCT GAD funds 

as to whether the intended purposes were realized. 

 

9.7. We reiterated our recommendation that the Management:  
 

a. continue developing and implementing more GAD-related 
programs, projects and activities that will address gender issues 

and concerns not only of the Agency but also its clientele, 

allocating/attributing to five percent of its annual appropriations, 

and submit the same to the PCW for review and endorsement to 

DBM; and 

 

b. instruct the GFPS to prepare its GPB in line with their specific 
programs and activities. Likewise, require the GFPS to furnish the 

Audit Team with a copy of the GAD AR, in compliance with COA 

Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

9.8. The Office, through its GAD Focal Point System, will provide the Audit Team 
with a respective copy of the GAD Plan and Budget CY 2020. The GAD AR 

was already encoded in the system but was not yet approved by PCW.

10. The Agency had complied with Section 32 of the General Provisions of                    
RA No. 11465, GAA for FY 2020 by undertaking several programs and activities 

for senior citizens and differently-abled persons during the year. 

10.1. Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA of FY 2020 provides that:

projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and 

persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated function, 

and integrate the same in their regular activities. 

 

10.2. For CY 2020, the NCCT incorporated seminars and activities to address 
concerns of senior citizens and persons with disabilities in its existing 

programs/activities, to wit:
