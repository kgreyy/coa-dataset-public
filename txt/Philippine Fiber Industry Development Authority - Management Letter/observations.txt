	4)	However, prior years’ fund transfers were not liquidated due to Management’s failure to monitor closely the timely liquidation thereof from the IAs, hence, the continuous increase and accumulation of unliquidated balances.



	5)	We recommended and Management agreed to:

	

a)	direct the Chief Accountant to coordinate with the IAs concerned to require the submission of liquidation reports/documents of the expended fund transfers and return the unutilized balances for unimplemented/ completed projects, if any; and

	3)	The accumulation of the outstanding fund transfers could be attributed to management’s failure to closely monitor the liquidation/delivery of goods and non-reconciliation of records with PS-DBM.

		

	4)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountant and Procurement Officer to coordinate with the PS-DBM to reconcile the remaining difference between their respective books and for undelivered goods to be delivered and/or refunded or replaced with new items.

		

		Delayed/Non-submission of government contracts

		

22)	Copy of 56 government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents with corresponding amount of ₱46.158 million were either not submitted or were not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from two to 134 days, inconsistent with Items 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009.



	1)	COA Circular No. 2009-001 provides that government contracts, purchase orders and its supporting documents should be submitted to the Audit Team. It provides the timelines within which the said documents should be submitted, as follows:



3.1.1 	Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned. In case of agencies audited on an engagement basis, submission of a copy of the contract and its supporting documents shall be to the Auditor of the mother agency or parent company, as the case may be.



X x x



3.2.1 	A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and every supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned.



	2)	Evaluation of the timeliness of submission of government contracts and purchase orders, including its supporting documents showed that ten were not submitted and 46 were submitted with delay ranging from two to 134 days, as follows:

	

	Type of Contract

	No. of Contracts

	3)	Non-submission or delayed submission of the said documents prevents the Audit Team from conducting a timely review of the contracts, even prior to the payment of the same, which could prevent unnecessary, excessive, extravagant and unconscionable expenditures which would expose agency personnel to possible liabilities for audit disallowances.

	

	4)	We recommended and Management agreed to submit the copy of contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents to enable the Audit Team to review the same.



Improper withholding and timely remittance of GSIS contributions and loans



23)	The PhilFIDA withheld contributions and loans amounting to ₱21.724 million from its employees and remitted to the GSIS the amount of ₱21.269 million, or a difference representing a net under-remittance of ₱0.455 million. Also, prior year’s balance amounting to ₱0.373 million remained unremitted as of year-end.



	1)	Section 5.c. of Republic Act (RA) No. 8291 dated May 30, 1997 otherwise known as “The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) Act of 1997” provides that “It shall be mandatory and compulsory for all employers to include the payment of contributions in their annual appropriations. Penal sanctions shall be imposed upon employers who fail to remit the accurate/exact amount of contributions on time, or delay the remittance of premium contributions to the GSIS. The heads of offices and agencies shall be administratively liable for non-remittance or delayed remittance of premium contributions to the GSIS.”



	2)	Section 6(b) of RA No. 8291 also states that “Each employer shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and employers’ contributions within the first ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply. The remittance by the employer of the contributions to the GSIS shall take priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except salaries and wages of its employees.”

	

	3)	The Agency had implemented the provisions of the GSIS Act of 1997 with regard to the mandatory deductions of employees’ contributions from their salaries. However, based on Agency records as of this date, the remittance of premiums is not in the exact amount of contributions withheld, as follows:

	

	Particulars

	4)	Moreover, premiums and loans withheld for CY 2019 and prior years amounting to ₱0.373 million remained unremitted contrary to Section 6 (b) of RA No. 8291 which states that the employers shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ contributions within the first ten days of the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply.



	5)	The non-remittance of the exact amount of contributions withheld monthly shows the Agency’s laxity in monitoring the remittances of the GSIS contributions. This also exposes the Agency personnel responsible to withhold and remit the GSIS contributions to possible penal sanctions and administrative liability as provided in RA No. 8291.

	

	6)	This is reiteration of prior years’ observation.

	

	7)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountant to:

	

a)	review the GSIS monthly deductions and ensure that remittances of premiums are the exact amount of contributions withheld to avoid administrative sanctions, as provided in RA No. 8291; and



b)	diligently continue the determination of the employee/s to whom the unremitted GSIS premiums and loans in the total amount of ₱0.373 million pertain and cause the remittance of the same.

	

Improper withholding and timely remittance of PhilHealth Contributions



24)	The PhilFIDA withheld contributions of ₱1.663 million from its employees and remitted to the PhilHealth the amount of ₱1.592 million for CY 2020. However, the monthly remittance of contributions is not the exact amount of contributions withheld showing an under-remittance of ₱0.071 million. Also, prior year’s contributions amounting to ₱0.022 million remained unremitted as of year-end.



	1)	Section 18 (b) of the National Health Insurance Act of 2013 (R.A. No. 7875 as Amended by R.A. Nos. 9241 and 10606) provides that “The monthly premium contribution of employed members shall be remitted by the employer on or before the date prescribed by the Corporation."



	2)	In addition, Section 11 of the same law prescribes that "Failure to remit the appropriate contribution shall be subject to interest and penalties as prescribed by the Corporation without prejudice to other applicable penalties ... "



	3)	The PhilFIDA’s PhilHealth Employer Number (PEN) is 003000030529, which indicates that remittances should be every 16th – 20th day of the month following the applicable period, pursuant to the PhilHealth issued Circular No. 0001 series of 2014 for the revised payment schedule, as follows:



Particulars

Employers with PENs ending in 0-4

Every 11th – 15th day of the month following the applicable period

Employers with PENs ending 5-9

Every 16th – 20th day of the month following the applicable period.

     

	4)	The Agency had implemented the provisions of the National Health Insurance Act of 2013 and PhilHealth Circular No. 2017-0024 with regard to the mandatory deductions of employees’ contributions from their salaries for CY 2020. However, based on agency records as of this date, the remittance of contributions is not the exact amount of contributions withheld as follows:

	5)	Moreover, contributions withheld in CY 2019 and prior years amounting to ₱0.022 million which were unidentified as to specific Regional Office (RO), remained unremitted contrary to pertinent provisions of RA No. 10606 and PhilHealth Circular No. 0001 s. of 2014.



	6)	The non-remittance of the exact amount of contributions withheld monthly shows the Agency’s laxity in monitoring the remittances of the PHIC contributions. Also, this exposes the Agency personnel responsible to withhold and remit PHIC contributions to possible penalties and administrative liability.



	7)	This is reiteration of prior years’ observation.



	8)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant to:



a)	review the monthly PhilHealth deductions of the CO and the ROs and ensure that the remittances of monthly premiums are the exact amount of contributions withheld to avoid administrative sanction as provided in RA No. 10606; and



b)	exert all efforts and continue the determination of the employee/s to whom the unremitted PhilHealth contributions in the total amount of ₱0.022 million pertain and cause the remittance of the same.



	Improper withholding and/or timely remittance of Pag-IBIG contributions and loans 



25)	The PhilFIDA withheld contributions and repayment of loans amounting to ₱4.222 million from its employees and remitted to the Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) the amount of ₱3.988 million, leaving an unremitted amount of ₱0.233 million. Also, prior years’ contributions amounting to ₱0.028 million remained unremitted as of year-end.



	1)	Based on agency records as of date, the amount remitted to the HDMF is not the exact amount of contributions withheld showing an under-remittance of .233 million, shown as follows:

	2)	Moreover, contributions withheld in CY 2019 and prior years amounting to ₱0.028 million remained unremitted. This shows the agency’s laxity in monitoring the remittances to the HDMF. Also, this exposes the Agency personnel responsible to withhold and remit HDMF contributions to possible penalties and administrative liability.



	3)	The non-remittance of the total amount of ₱0.262  million is not in accord with Section 3, Rule VII of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA No. 9679, otherwise known as the HDMF Law of 2009 which states that all employers shall remit to the Fund their contributions and the contributions of their covered employees as well as the latter's loan amortizations or payments to the Fund, as provided for under Section 2 of this Rule, when applicable, within fifteen (15) days from the same were collected unless another period is previously agreed upon between the employer and the Fund, or within such periods as the Fund may prescribe otherwise. X x x.



	4)	This is reiteration of prior years’ observation.









	5)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant to:



a)	comply with the HDMF Law of 2009 in the withholding and remittance of employees’ and government share; and



b)	diligently continue the determination of the employee/s to whom the unremitted HDMF contributions pertain amounting to ₱0.028 million and cause the remittance of the same.



	Improper withholding and/or timely remittance of taxes 



26)	The taxes on gross compensation income from officials and employees and government procurement of goods, consultancy services and infrastructure projects from suppliers/ contractors during the year amounting to ₱9.118 million and ₱4.368 million, respectively, were withheld for CY 2020. However, remittance of the taxes withheld showed differences representing a net under remittance of ₱0.035 million.



	1)	For taxes withheld for CY 2020, remittances were not for the full amount leaving a balance of ₱0.035 million. This is contrary to Revenue Regulation No. 11-2018 introducing tax laws reform otherwise known as TRAIN LAW, reiterating the provisions of Revenue Regulation No. 2-98 dated April 17, 1998 which provides that withholding agents shall file BIR Monthly Remittance Form every tenth (10th) day of the following month when the withholding is made, regardless of the amount withheld.



	2)	The taxes withheld and remitted for CY 2020 are as follows:

	3)	Non-remittance of the full taxes withheld exposes the personnel responsible to withheld and remit the same to penalties and sanctions under tax laws.

	

	4)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountant to:

	

a)		determine the cause of the over-remittance for taxes on gross compensation income from officials and employees;

	

b)		remit immediately all unremitted taxes withheld; and



c)		remit the taxes withheld intact and on time to avoid the imposition of surcharge and penalty.



Hiring of and payments to job orders and contract of service individuals



27)	As of December 31, 2020, 151 individuals covered with Contract of Service (COS) or Job Order (JO) were hired to augment the 308 regular plantilla employees of PhilFIDA with corresponding payments amounting to ₱19.396 million as of December 31, 2020, in accordance with CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1 dated June 15, 2017, as updated by CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2, s 2020, dated October 20, 2020. Their salaries were charged against Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE), as authorized under DBM Circular Letter (CL) No. 2013-5 dated July 22, 2013.



Non-allocation and/or utilization of fund for GAD programs/activities



28)	GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) were not submitted to the Audit Team within the period prescribed under Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014. Moreover, the GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) shows low utilization rate of 3.65 percent of the total agency budget contrary to Section 31 of the General Provisions (GP) of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of FY 2020.



	1)	Under Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014, the audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit Team assigned to the agency within five (5) working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) or their mother or central offices, as the case maybe. Likewise, PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 2021 provides that the deadline of encoding and submission to PCW of FY 2020 GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) of executive departments and their attached agencies through Gender Mainstreaming and Monitoring System (GMMS) is on March 12, 2021. Moreover, Section 7.0 of the same circular further states that “FY 2020 GAD ARs submitted to PCW shall be authenticated by the GMMS with a barcode. Concerned agencies shall print the GMMS-authenticated GAD AR for signature of their agency head and submit signed copies to PCW and their respective COA Audit Team”.



	2)	For CY 2020, the PCW issued Memorandum Circular 2019-02 for the guidelines on the preparation and online submission of FY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget (GPB). The schedule provided therein shows that the period when the PCW endorses acceptable GPBs was on August to November 2019. Hence, more than a year has passed since the PhilFIDA’s GPB should have been submitted to the Audit Team. However, as of date, no GPB was submitted to the Audit Team.



	3)	Moreover, the GAD Accomplishment Report showed a low utilization rate of 3.65 percent which is below the minimum requirement of five percent per Section 31 of the GP of GAA FY 2020. Evaluation whether the activities reported therein formally and fully addressed GAD issues and concerns cannot be made as these could not be compared with the planned activities which should have been indicated in the GPB. Likewise, supporting documents of the reported activities were not submitted, hence, hampering the verification of the actual accomplishments.



	4)	The GAD Secretariat explained that the low fund utilization rate of 3.65 percent was due to the cost savings as many of the trainings were conducted through online means. Hence, funds for TEVs and accommodations were saved. Likewise, the low fund utilization of the Cotton Project, which also has a training component, contributed to the low fund utilization rate for GAD activities.



	5)	We recommended and Management agreed to:

	

a)		strictly adhere to Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 for the timely submission of the said reports to the COA Audit Team; and 

	

b)		ensure that all activities to address GAD issues and concerns are conducted during the year that it was planned.



Non-allocation and/or utilization of fund for SCPD programs/activities



29)	The agency failed to submit plans, programs, projects and accomplishment reports intended to address concerns of Senior Citizens and persons with disability (PWDs). Thus, it cannot be determined whether such plans, programs, projects were indeed formulated as required under Section 32 of the GP of the GAA  FY 2020.



	1)	Section 32 of the GP, GAA FY 2020 states that all agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.

	

	2)	The same GAA provision also provides that all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and R.A. No. 7277, as amended.

	

	3)	For CY 2020, record showed that the agency failed to submit plans, programs, projects and accomplishment reports relative to Senior Citizen and PWDs. Thus, the requirement under Section 32 of the General Provisions, GAA  FY 2020 may not be complied with.



	4)	Likewise, non-submission of the said plans, programs, projects and accomplishment reports resulted in the failure to determine as to whether the agency was able to formally and fully address issues and concerns relative to Senior Citizen and PWDs.

	

	5)	We recommended and Management agreed to, henceforth, prepare and submit the plans, programs, projects and accomplishment reports intended to address concerns of Senior Citizens and PWDs and strictly adhere to the provisions of GAA relative to Senior Citizens and PWDs.





Implementation of ODA Funded Projects



	6)	The agency did not receive and disburse funds for the implementation of Official Development Assistance (ODA) Funded projects.



Audit suspensions, disallowances and charges



30)	Notices of Suspension (NSs) and Notices of Disallowance (NDs) were issued for transactions audited during the year amounting to ₱575.433 million due to non-compliance with various laws, rules and regulations. Moreover, only the amount of ₱447.833 million was settled with corresponding Notices of Settlement of Suspension, Disallowance and Charge (NSSDCs) issued during the year, leaving unsettled suspensions, disallowances and charges amounting to ₱147.139 million as of the end of the year.



	1)	COA Circular No. 2009-006 or the Revised Rules of Settlement of Accounts dated September 15, 2009 provides the period within which to settle suspensions, disallowances and charges, as follows:



Suspensions

within ninety (90) calendar days from receipt of the NS

Disallowances

within six (6) months from the receipt of the ND by the persons liable

Charges

within six (6) months from the receipt of the NC



	2)	The said COA Circular also requires the head of agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, to ensure that the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within the prescribed period and the requirements of transactions suspended in audit are complied with.



	3)	The total audit suspensions, disallowances and charges found in the audit of various transactions as of December 31, 2020 based on the NS/ND/Notice of Charge (NC)/NSSDC issued by this Commission, is summarized as follows:
