   PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



A)	Financial Audit



Unqualified opinion on financial statements



1)	An unqualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements despite the accounting errors/omissions amounting to ₱2.718 million which, however did not exceed the materiality level of ₱4.357 million.



Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 provides that:



“Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position; financial performance, and cash flow of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs.”



The following errors/omissions amounting to ₱10.971 million were adjusted/corrected by the Accountant:

b)		Misposting of PhilHealth contributions to Pag-IBIG contributions’ general ledger

However, the financial statements showed various accounting errors/omissions amounting to ₱2.718 million which were not adjusted but did not exceed the materiality level of ₱4.357 million, thus, did not affect the reported total Assets, Liabilities and Net Assets/Equity amounting to ₱294.871 million, ₱46.051 million, and ₱248.820 million, respectively, as summarized below:

We recommended and Management agreed to require the OIC-Chief Accountant to effect the necessary adjustments on the errors/omissions with the corresponding supporting documents.



B)	Compliance with Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

	

Fund utilization/obligation



2)	Overall, the agency’s fund utilization/obligation of ₱275.496 million is 99.99 percent compared to its appropriation/allotment of ₱275.502 million. Also, it registered a utilization rate of 99.99 percent or ₱225.318 million for its Fisheries Research and Development Program, which were in accordance with the purpose of appropriation/allotment of ₱225.319 million. Moreover, a total amount of ₱11.818 million representing 4.66 percent of the total released allotment for Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) and Capital Outlays (CO) were discontinued pursuant to Republic Act (RA) No. 11469 as implemented by National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 580.



Cash utilization/disbursements



3)	Of the total cash allocation of ₱268.210 million received during the year, 100.00 percent or ₱268.210 million was utilized/disbursed. Also, disbursements amounting to ₱217.424 million for its Fisheries Research and Development Program were found to be regular, necessary and not excessive, extravagant and unconscionable.

       

Reversion of dormant cash, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary fund



4)	The NFRDI has no dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds and related accounts for reversion as of year-end, in conformity with Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012, dated September 11, 2012, implementing Executive Order No. 431, dated May 30, 2005.



Granting and liquidation of cash advances



5)	Cash advances during the year for payroll, operating expenses, official local and foreign travels and special purpose/time-bound undertakings amounting to ₱5.392 million were granted and liquidated within the prescribed period in accordance with COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. There were no unliquidated cash advances in prior years.



Non-liquidation of fund transfers to IAs and NGOs/POs



6)	Fund transfers to implementing agencies (IAs) and Non-Government Organizations/People’s Organizations (NGOs/POs) during the year for the implementation of agency’s projects amounting to ₱76.604 million or 55.77 percent of the funds transferred were not liquidated, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013 and COA Circular No. 2007-001. Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years amounting to ₱3.031 million or 30.33 percent of prior years’ balance of ₱9.994 million.



COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 sets forth the rules and regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to implementing agencies.  This is to ensure that the transfer is properly taken up in the books of the Source Agency (SA) and Implementing Agency (IA) and used only for the intended purpose and that proper accounting and reporting is made of the utilization of the funds.



Section 4.6 provides that:



“Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds.”



Section 4.9 states that:



“The IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion of the project.”



COA Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007 provides for the guidelines in the granting, utilization, accounting and auditing of funds released to NGOs/POs. Section 5.4, thereof states that:



“Within sixty (60) days after the completion of the project, the NGO/PO shall submit the final Fund Utilization Report certified by its Accountant and approved by its President/Chairman to the Government Organization (GO), together with inspection report and certificate of project completion issued by the GO authorized representative, list of beneficiaries with their acceptance/ acknowledgement of the project funds/ goods/ services received. The validity of these documents shall be verified by the internal auditor or equivalent official of the GO and shall be the basis of the GO in recording the fund utilization/expenses in its books of accounts.”



Fund transfers to National Government Agencies (NGAs) and NGOs/POs during the year for the implementation of agency’s projects amounted to ₱137.348 million, of which ₱60.744 million or 44.23 percent was liquidated and ₱76.604 million or 55.77 percent remained unliquidated. Also, of the prior years’ (PY) fund transfers of ₱9.994 million, ₱6.963 million or 69.67 percent were liquidated while ₱3.031 million or 30.33 percent remained unliquidated, details are as follow:

Out of the fund transfers of ₱137.348 million, 94.75 percent or ₱130.138 million were granted to BFAR Regional Offices (ROs) for the implementation of National Stock Assessment Programs (NSAP) in the different regions all over the country. NSAP is jointly implemented by NFRDI and BFAR ROs for the period January 1 to December 31, 2020 to conduct assessment of major pelagic and demersal species in major fishing grounds of the country through establishment of standardized time series and biological data by fishing ground (bays/gulfs/seas), which are fundamental to science-based fisheries management, formulation of policies, plans and strategies.  However, during the year, only ₱60.534 million or 46.52 percent were liquidated out of the fund transfer of ₱130.138 million leaving an unliquidated balance of ₱69.604 million. Management justified that most of the balances not liquidated were intended for the activities not undertaken during the enhanced community quarantine due to limited mobility and work force because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Also, of the ₱7.110 million fund transfer during the year to Southeast Asian Development Center/Aquaculture Department (SEAFDEC/AQD) for the 3rd year implementation of Aquafeed Research, Development and Extension Project (ARDEP), which aimed to collaborate on developing low-cost quality aquaculture feeds for priority species to lower aquaculture production cost for the benefit of fish farmers in the Philippines, only ₱0.110 million or 1.54 percent were liquidated  leaving an unliquidated balance of ₱7.000 million or 98.46 percent as of year-end.



Further, fund transfer during the year to National Academy of Science and Technology – Philippine Science Heritage Foundation, Inc. (NAST-PSHFI), a NGO/PO, for the Annual Scientific Meeting amounting to ₱0.100 million was duly liquidated as of year-end. However, of the prior year fund transfers to Philippine Phycological Society, Inc. (PPSI), Philippine Association of Marine Science, Inc. (PAMS), and Philippine Association of Career Scientists, Inc. (PACSI) amounting to ₱0.100 million, ₱0.150 million, ₱0.025 million, respectively, only PAMS and PACSI liquidated, leaving an unliquidated balance of ₱0.100 million as of year-end which pertained to PPSI.



Furthermore, during the year BFAR ROs were granted additional fund transfers amounting to ₱25.746 million despite their failure to submit promptly the liquidation reports for their unliquidated fund transfer of ₱41.890 million resulting in the accumulation of unliquidated balances.  



Management through its Accounting Section exerted all the efforts needed in complying the said observation. Demand letters were sent to the implementing agencies for the immediate liquidation of the fund transfers. Further, Management avowed that they continuously communicated to the concerned IAs and NGOs/POs on the liquidation of the said fund transfers, and affirmed that COA Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2007-001 will be strictly followed/observed in granting additional fund transfers.



We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations and Management agreed to:

 

a)	require the Accountant to coordinate with the IAs and NGOs/POs concerned to immediately submit liquidation reports together with the supporting documents and return any unused balance for unimplemented/completed projects to fully settle the outstanding accounts with NFRDI; and



b)	refrain from granting additional fund transfers when the previous transfers were not yet liquidated to avoid accumulation of unliquidated balances.



Non-liquidation of fund transfers to PS-DBM



7)	For CY 2020, no fund transfer was made to Procurement Service (PS-DBM), however, prior years’ fund transfers to PS-DBM for the agency’s procurement of office supplies amounting to ₱0.054 million, or 26.34 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱0.205 million were still undelivered as of year-end, thus, deprived the agency of the benefits of the items for its operations.



COA Circular No. 94-013 dated Dec. 13, 1994 sets forth the rules and regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to implementing agencies.  This is to ensure that the transfer is properly taken up in the books of the Source Agency (SA) and Implementing Agency (IA) and used only for the intended purpose and that proper accounting and reporting is made of the utilization of the funds. Item 6.7 thereof, provides that it is the duty and responsibility of the Implementing Agency (IA) to return to the Source Agency (SA) any unused balance upon the completion of the project.



The balance of the fund transfers to PS-DBM as of December 31, 2020 is shown below:

Result of confirmation with the PS-DBM as of October 31, 2020 disclosed that the agency’s balance of fund transfer is ₱0.067 million resulting in a discrepancy of ₱0.013 million. 



Management has already coordinated with the PS-DBM to reconcile the noted discrepancy and requested to furnish them copies of the delivery receipts to adjust their record, where appropriate.



Had management regularly monitored and reconciled its advances with the PS-DBM, the latter could have been compelled to deliver the supplies promptly and discrepancies could have been immediately detected and corrected.



This observation is a reiteration of prior year’s audit with modification which the Management still failed to comply.



Management commented that prior years remaining balance will no longer be replaced with new items. Copy of the letter from PS-DBM dated March 10, 2021   was provided to the Audit Team, where it clarified that the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) has swept the PS bank accounts on March 31 and April 02, 2020. Part of the cash sweep were the dormant funds of NFRDI from 2012 and prior years, and savings from Agency Procurements Requests (APRs) in CYs 2013 to 2019. This was confirmed thru a letter from the BTr.



Also, PS-DBM Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) No. 21-01-0162 dated January 31, 2021 was submitted as an attachment to support the derecognition of Due from PS-DBM account in the books of NFRDI, which was not yet effected in the books according to the OIC, Chief Accountant. 



We recommended and Management agreed to coordinate with the PS-DBM for the reconciliation and determination of unutilized balance; and request immediate delivery of supplies equivalent to the unliquidated balance, and/or refund any excess, when necessary.



Management should have been eager in coordination and follow up with the PS-DBM so that deliveries of supplies and materials should have been timely made which could have been used by the agency for its operation. This should be done in case future fund transfer will be made to avoid similar problem.



Dormant accounts for write-off



8)	The NFRDI has no dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers for write-off, in accordance with Section 8.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



Insurance of physical assets with the GSIS



9)	The agency insured with the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) property amounting to ₱81.353 million with corresponding insurance premiums paid in the amount of ₱0.567 million, in accordance with RA No. 656, otherwise known as the “Property Insurance Law” as amended by Presidential Decree (PD) No. 245 dated July 13, 1973.



Non-disposal of unserviceable property



10)	Unserviceable property with book value of ₱0.589 million remained not disposed of, contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 1445, thus, exposing them to further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value. 



Section 79 of P.D. No. 1445 provides that: 



“When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative x x x and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body x x x. In the event that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned x x x”

The Management submitted an Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) on December 3, 2020 with attached itemized list, description and appraised value of the unserviceable property and equipment.



Review of the report submitted revealed that documents such as Equipment Ledger Card, pictures of the subject property and disposal program were not submitted, hence, on December 15, 2020, the Audit Team returned to the Property Section the report requesting for the submission of complete set of documents pertaining to the disposal of the equipment in accordance with Section 79 of PD 1445.



Non-preparation of the documents supporting the IIRUP impedes the disposal of the unserviceable property and exposes such assets to further deterioration, thus, depriving the government of potential income that could be generated from the sale thereof.



We recommended and Management agreed to submit the IIRUP together with the complete supporting documents and facilitate disposal of the unserviceable PPE without further delay, pursuant to Section 79 of PD No. 1445.



Procurement of goods and services, consultancy services and infrastructure projects



11)	This year’s procurement of goods through negotiated procurement (emergency purchase), amounting to ₱1.345 million, were in accordance with Section 53.2 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulation (IRR) of RA No. 9184 (Procurement Law).

Submission of government contracts



12)	Copies of 463 government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents with corresponding amount of ₱44.110 million were submitted within the prescribed period, in accordance with Items 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 and the same were verified to be complete and in order.



Improper remittance of GSIS contributions and loans



13)	The GSIS personal share and loans payments of employees during the year amounting to ₱1.647 million and ₱1.446 million, respectively, were deducted properly but not remitted intact and on time, with delay ranging from 51 to 325 days, contrary to RA No. 8291, the GSIS Act of 1997. Moreover, prior years’ balance amounting to ₱0.026 million remained unremitted as of year-end.



Pertinent provisions of RA No. 8291 and its IRR provides the following:



Section 14.1 – “Each government agency shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and government agency’s contributions within the first ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply.”



Section 14.2 – “The government agency shall also deduct from the fixed monthly compensation of the employee the loan amortizations (consolidated loans, policy loan, emergency loan, housing loan, and other loans), premium payments (optional, pre-need and other non-life insurance) and other amounts due the GSIS.”



Section 14.3 – “The said amounts shall be remitted to the GSIS within the first Ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month when the deductions were effected, accompanied by supporting lists in the form prescribed by the GSIS.”



For CY 2020, the agency withheld and remitted GSIS contributions and loan amortizations, including the government share, as follows:

As can be gleaned from the table above, withheld personal share and loan amortization for CY 2020 were not remitted to GSIS intact, with delays ranging from 51 to 325 days, contrary to Sections 14.1 and 14.3 of the RA 8291 and its IRR.

Moreover, prior years’ balance amounting to ₱0.026 million remained unremitted, hence, a combined balance of unremitted premiums and loan amortization of ₱0.338 million as of year-end, shown as follows: 



Particulars

Amount

(In Million Pesos)

Beginning Balance

Unremitted premiums and loans during the year

The Accountant explained that the unremitted balance was due to: (i) ongoing reconciliation by the Human Resources Management Section (HRMS) of the data of NFRDI employees; (ii) updating of salaries based on the new Salary Standardization Law (SSL); and processing of files/data of transferred employees from BFAR to NFRDI.



The unremitted premiums may affect the resources of the GSIS to invest and fund the retirement claims and other benefits of its members. Whereas, the unremitted GSIS loan amortizations may incur arrearages, and there is a possible risk of default if remained unpaid for a longer period of time. This will result in the lower retirement or separation benefits of the government employees concerned due to the offsetting of their outstanding loan obligations to GSIS.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the OIC-Chief Accountant and the OIC, Human Resource Management Section to: 



a)	expedite the reconciliation of data, updating of salaries and processing of files of employees;



b)	exert diligent effort in the reconciliation of prior years’ balance; and 



c)	henceforth, remit promptly the amounts withheld to GSIS pursuant to the provisions of RA 8291 to avoid penal sanctions under Section 5 thereof.



Withholding and remittance of PhilHealth contributions 



14)	The PhilHealth personal share of employees amounting to ₱0.244 million were deducted properly and remitted without delay, in accordance with RA No. 7875, as amended by RA No. 9241 (National Health Insurance Act of 1995). Likewise, the employer’s share amounting to ₱0.244 million was remitted without delay.



Withholding and remittance of Pag-IBIG contributions, loans and employer’s share



15)	The Pag-IBIG personal share and loans of employees amounting to ₱0.288 million and ₱0.125 million, respectively, were deducted properly and remitted without delay, in accordance with RA No. 7875, as amended by RA No. 9679 (Pag-IBIG Fund Law 2009). Moreover, prior year’s unremitted premiums and loans amounting to ₱0.027 million were already remitted.  Likewise, the employer’s share amounting to ₱0.046 million was remitted without delay.



Withholding and remittance of taxes



16)	The taxes on gross compensation income from officials and employees and government purchases and contract of services from suppliers/contractors amounting to ₱1.509 million and ₱4.587 million, respectively, were properly withheld and remitted without delay, in accordance with Revenue Regulation No. 10-2008 dated July 8, 2008.



Hiring of and payments to job orders, contractual and consultants



17)	During the year, 199 individuals covered with Contract of Service (COS) or Job Order (JO) were hired on a semestral basis, in accordance with CSC COA DBM Joint Circular No. 1 dated June 15, 2017, as updated by CSC COA DBM Joint Circular No. 2, s. 2020, dated October 20, 2020, to augment the regular plantilla employees of 72, due to the need for additional manpower. Their salaries were charged against Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) in the total amount of ₱40.355 million, as authorized under DBM Circular Letter (CL) No. 2013-5 dated July 22, 2013.



Non-submission of GAD Accomplishment Report



18)	The agency allocated ₱25.742 million for its GAD programs and activities representing nine percent of the total appropriations of ₱286.467 million, in compliance with Section 31 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020.  However, the GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) was not timely submitted to the audit team as required under PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 2021, hence, audit of the GAD funds and programs was not undertaken.



Section 31 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 provides that:



“The GAD plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets.”



Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 2021: Submission of FY 2020 GAD Accomplishment Report.



Section 1.0 of the PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 2021 provides that March 12, 2021 is the deadline of encoding and submission to PCW of FY 2020 GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) of executive departments and their attached agencies through Gender Mainstreaming and Monitoring System (GMMS). Moreover, Section 7.0 of the same circular further states that “FY 2020 GAD ARs submitted to PCW shall be authenticated by the GMMS with a barcode. Concerned agencies shall print the GMMS-authenticated GAD AR for signature of their agency head and submit signed copies to PCW and their respective COA Audit Team”. 



The approved GAD Plan and Budget for CY 2020 showed that the agency allocated the amount of ₱25.742 million for programs and activities pertaining to gender and development representing nine percent of the total appropriations of the agency for FY 2020 amounting to ₱286.467 million.



However, the GAD Focal Person did not submit copy of the corresponding AR to the COA Audit Team as required under PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01. The Audit Team reminded the submission of the said AR, but according to the staff of the GAD Focal Person, the preparation of the AR is still ongoing.



Due to the absence of the AR, evaluation on the utilization of the GAD budget and implementation of planned programs and activities could not be undertaken.



Management submitted the GAD AR on 23 March 2021 and explained that most of the activities were cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 17 planned activities only four (4) were actually done with expenditures amounting to ₱0.352 million. However, no supporting documents attached to the submitted GAD AR such as reference document of actual cost/expenditures incurred to facilitate review thereof.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the GAD Focal Person to expedite the preparation and submission to the Audit Team of the AR pursuant to PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 for evaluation of the fund utilization and implementation of the GAD program and activities together with the supporting documents of the expenditures incurred in relation to GAD programs and activities.



Senior Citizen and Person with Disability plans/programs



19)	The agency spent ₱0.011 million in the implementation of the activities for the Senior Citizen and Person with Disability (SCPD), in addition to providing ramps, a wheelchair and priority lane for them, in compliance with Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for CY 2020. 



Implementation of ODA Funded Projects



20)	The NFRDI has no Official Development Assistance (ODA) Funded Project for CY 2020.









Receipt and utilization of Disaster Related Fund



21)	The NFRDI did not receive Disaster Risk Reduction Management (DRRM) Fund and/or Quick Response Fund (QRF) for CY 2020.



Audit suspensions, disallowances and charges



22)	There were no audit disallowances, suspensions and charges issued during the year. Of the ₱3.976 million audit disallowances for prior years, only ₱0.859 million was settled with corresponding Notices of Settlement of Suspension, Disallowance and Charge (NSSDCs) issued during the year, leaving an unsettled disallowance amounting to ₱3.117 million as of the end of the year.



COA Circular No. 2009-006 or the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts dated September 15, 2009 provides, among others, that:

We recommended and Management agreed to ensure strict enforcement of settlement of disallowance through demand letters to the persons liable, and if proven to be futile, resort to all other legal modes for the extinguishment of obligations as provided in Section 1231 of the New Civil Code of the Philippines, otherwise legal action may be undertaken against those persons solidary liable, particularly the certifying/approving officers.





C)	Compliance with Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements of Funds Utilized for COVID Initiatives



	Payment of Hazard Pay



23)	Payments of hazard pay granted to the concerned personnel of NFRDI amounting to ₱1.803 million lacked the required supporting documents contrary to Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001, thus the validity, completeness and propriety of the disbursements were doubtful. 



Section 4(6) of PD 1445 states that “claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.”



Section 36(f), Chapter 2, Volume I of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) requires the submission of proper evidence to establish validity of the claim.



Item 5.8 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribes the guidelines and documentary requirements for hazard pay.



Section 2 of Administrative Order (AO) No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 provides for the conditions on the grant of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay:



“Xxx personnel have been authorized to physically report for work at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official working hours by the head of agency xxx” 



“Xxx rate of COVID-19 Hazard Pay shall be based on the number of days an employee physically reports for work xxx”



Paragraph 9.0 of DBM-DOST Joint Circular (JC) No. 1 dated June 25, 2013 provides that: 

“Hazard Allowance is an additional compensation for performing hazardous duties and for enduring physical hardships in the course of performance of duties.”



Also, Paragraph 9.2 of the same Circular prescribed the basis of computation of hazard allowance: 



“The Hazard Allowance for a month shall be based on the degree of risk to hazards, and the number of workdays of actual exposure over 22 workdays in a month, at rates not to exceed 30% of monthly basic salary.”



Section 5.4.2 of the IRR of RA 8439 also provides that: 



“Payment shall be based on actual presence in the hazardous work areas. The entitlement to the hazard allowance shall be co-terminus with the assignment of the personnel in the hazardous work areas.”



Likewise, NFRDI formulated Guidelines on Payment of Hazard Allowance adopted from Section 2.2 of DOST Administrative Order No. 10, s.2013 which enumerates the means of verification in the granting of hazard allowance as follows:



a)	NFRDI Hazard Allowance Form 3 signed by the immediate supervisor and HRMU and Material Safety Data Sheet of the hazardous chemicals, biological samples, equipment and other materials used during operations; and



b)	Copy of official travel with Appendix A, certificate of appearance from the municipality/barangay with contact number.



During the year, payment of hazard pay/hazard allowance to various NFRDI personnel were made amounting to ₱1.999 million, consisting of a) hazard pay relative to COVID-19 outbreak pursuant to AO No. 26 amounting to ₱1.013 million; and b) hazard pay pursuant to RA 8439 Magna Carta, as amended by RA 11312 amounting to ₱0.986 million.



Review of the documents attached to the Disbursement Vouchers for payment of hazard pay/hazard allowance amounting to ₱1.803 million revealed the lack of the necessary supporting documents as follows:



a)	Hazard Pay Relative to COVID-19 Outbreak:



--	Office Order/Authority to report for work/Certification as member of the designated Skeleton Work Force; and



--	Certified true copy of Approved Daily Time Record (DTR) or Proof of Attendance.



b)	Hazard Pay – RA 8439 Magna Carta, as amended by RA 11312:



--	NFRDI Hazard Allowance Form 3 signed by the immediate supervisor and HRMU attesting to the reported duration of actual exposure to hazardous environment by the concerned personnel and Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) of the hazardous chemicals, biological samples, equipment and other materials used during operations;



--	Copy of official travel with Appendix A, certificate of appearance from the municipality/barangay with contact number; 



--	Copy of special order from the agency head covering the assignment to hazardous/difficult areas; and



--	Certified true copy of Approved DTR.



The submitted document on hazard pay relative to COVID-19 outbreak as a proof of attendance is a mere list of personnel who reported on a certain date during the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ)/ Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine (MECQ) without the signature of the guard on duty and not certified by the Human Resource Management Section (HRMS). The Audit Team asked for the certified true copy of the DTR, however, Management explained that during the ECQ and MECQ they suspended the use of biometric machine in monitoring the attendance of the personnel as a precautionary measure in the spread of COVID-19 virus. The Audit Team though asked for the submission of other proof or evidence to support that personnel indeed reported for work such as manual record based on the logbook maintained by the guard on duty, however, submission was not yet received to-date. Management explained that preparation of manual DTR based on the guard’s logbook is still on-going.



On the other hand, supporting documents for hazard pay under RA 8439, Magna Carta for Scientists, Engineers, Researchers and Other S&T Personnel in the Government, as amended by RA 11312 were not submitted yet to the Audit Team.



Inquiry with the Accounting personnel on why the said claim was processed even without the proper documentation revealed that due to time constraint in the utilization of the available funds there was an agreement between the Accounting Section and the HRMS that the latter would provide the required documents before the disbursement vouchers be forwarded to the Office of the Auditor. However, review of the disbursement vouchers submitted disclosed that no supporting documents were attached to support the payment of the said claim.



The validity, completeness and propriety of the recorded disbursements were doubtful due to incomplete documentation as required under Section 4(6) of PD 1445, thus, failure to submit immediately the lacking documents, the said disbursements will be suspended in audit.



Further audit disclosed that payment under ADA No. 9920040633 dated April 16, 2020 amounting to ₱0.008 million for the period March 16-31, 2020 includes period not covered by ECQ and MECQ. AO No. 26 only authorizes hazard pay starting March 17, 2020 during the ECQ and MECQ, however, one personnel was granted hazard pay for March 16, thus, resulting in overpayment of ₱500.00. This represents only a sample of the hazard pay/hazard allowance audited since the lack of documentation prevented the audit team to further the audit.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	submit the required supporting documents –



a.1) 	For hazard pay on COVID-19 outbreak:

	

(i) 	Office Order/Authority to report for work/Certification as member of the designated Skeleton Work Force;

	

a.2)	For hazard pay on RA 8439, as amended by RA 11312:

	

 (ii)	NFRDI Hazard Allowance Form 3 signed by the immediate supervisor and HRMU attesting to the reported duration of actual exposure to hazardous environment by the concerned personnel and MSDS of the hazardous chemicals, biological samples, equipment and other materials used during operations; 



(iii) 	copy of official travel with Appendix A, certificate of appearance from the municipality/barangay with contact number;  

(iv) 	copy of special order from the agency head covering the assignment to hazardous/difficult areas;

	

a.3)	Certified true copy of approved Daily Time Record (DTR), or manual record duly signed by the employee and immediate supervisor as proof of attendance;



b)	require the Accounting Section to refrain from processing claims with incomplete documentation to avoid suspension in audit; and

	

c)	require the personnel concerned to refund the overpayment of hazard allowance amounting to ₱500.00, otherwise, the same shall be disallowed in audit.

		

		Grant of Economic Relief Assistance for COVID-19 Pandemic

		

24)	Payment of Economic Relief Assistance amounting to ₱0.585 million to permanent employees without legal basis contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, thus, irregular and illegal.



COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 prescribes the Updated Guidelines for the Prevention and Disallowance of Irregular, Unnecessary, Excessive, Extravagant and Unconscionable Expenditures. 



Section 3.0 of the said Circular defines irregular expenditures as those “incurred without adhering to established rules, regulations xxx.” 



Audit revealed that on May 29, 2020 the agency disbursed funds charged against Other Maintenance and Operating Expenses amounting to ₱0.585 million as Economic Relief Assistance for COVID-19 Pandemic to permanent employees at ₱15,000.00 each. No document was attached to the disbursement voucher as basis for granting the said benefits.



Furthermore, no reason was given by the agency personnel upon inquiry on why the benefits were given despite no legal basis. Instead, a copy of memorandum from the National President, BFAR Employees Union approved by the BFAR-National Director was submitted requesting to grant the release of Emergency Relief Assistance in the amount of ₱15,000.00 per employee as a form of Financial Assistance embodied in the 2019-2022 Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) between the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) and BFAR-Employees Union (BFAR-EU).



The CNA between BFAR and BFAR-EU is not a valid basis for the granting of Economic Relief Assistance of NFRDI, thus, payment of the said benefit is irregular and illegal.



Item 1.3(a) of DBM Circular No. 2020-5 dated November 4, 2020 provides for the guidelines on the grant of CNA Incentive for FY 2020:



‘There is a valid CNA executed between the agency and the recognized employee organization which includes a provision on cost-cutting measures to be undertaken collectively by the agency and its personnel.”

 

Also, Item 4.4.1 of the same Circular states that:



“The CNA Incentive for the year shall be a one-time benefit to be granted not earlier than December 15, 2020.”



Based on the foregoing guidelines, the NFRDI cannot grant this benefit since the agency is separate and distinct from that of BFAR. Further, payment of CNA should not be earlier than December 15, 2020.



We recommended Management to enforce the immediate refund of the Economic Relief Assistance of ₱15,000.00 each from all recipients concerned, or in the total amount of ₱0.585 million which was granted without legal basis, otherwise such payment shall be disallowed in audit.
