EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A.	Introduction



The National Fisheries Research and Development Institute (NFRDI) was established on February 1, 2001 as the primary research arm of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR). Both agencies are under the Department of Agriculture (DA).  



NFRDI is mandated to ensure the welfare of the Philippine fisheries sector. It was created by virtue of Section 82 of Republic Act (RA) No. 8550, otherwise known as the Philippine Fisheries Code of 1998, in recognition of the important role of fisheries research in the development, management, conservation and protection of the country’s fisheries and aquatic resources and was amended on July 28, 2014 under RA No. 10654, an act to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and under regulated fishing.



The NFRDI is headed by Dr. Lilian C. Garcia, CESO V, the Acting Executive Director. NFRDI has a Central Office (CO) and three (3) Centers headed by Center Chiefs. The manpower complement of NFRDI as of December 31, 2020, totaled 271 consisting of 67 permanent, 5 coterminous with the incumbent (CTI) and 199 Job Orders (JO) and Contracts of Service (COS).

Also, a negative General Allotment Release Order (GARO) representing RLIP amounting to ₱2.031 million was received from the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) pursuant to DBM Circular Letter No. 2020-6 dated March 20, 2020. Thus, an adjusted allotment received for CY 2020 amounting to ₱275.502 million.



C.	Scope and Objectives of Audit



Financial and Compliance audits were conducted on the transactions, accounts and operations of the NFRDI for CY 2020 to: (a) ascertain the level of assurance that maybe placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.



D. 	Independent Auditor’s Report



	An unqualified opinion was rendered on the CY 2020 financial statements since the reported misstatements in an aggregate amount of ₱2.718 million did not affect the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements, as discussed in detail in Part II of this report.



E.	Significant Observations and Recommendations



1)	Fund transfers to implementing agencies (IAs) and Non-Government Organizations/People’s Organizations (NGOs/POs) during the year for the implementation of agency’s projects amounting to ₱76.604 million, or 55.77 percent, of the funds transferred were not liquidated, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013 and COA Circular No. 2007-001. Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years amounting to ₱3.031 million or 30.33 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱9.994 million. (Observation No. 6)



We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations and Management agreed to:

 

a)	require the Accountant to coordinate with the IAs and NGO/PO concerned to immediately submit liquidation reports together with the supporting documents and return any unused balance for unimplemented/completed projects to fully settle the outstanding accounts with NFRDI; and



b)	refrain from granting additional fund transfers when the previous transfers were not yet liquidated to avoid accumulation of unliquidated balances.



2)	For CY 2020, no fund transfer was made to Procurement Service (PS-DBM), however, prior years’ fund transfers to PS-DBM for the agency’s procurement of office supplies amounting to ₱0.054 million, or 26.34 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱0.205 million were still undelivered as of year-end, thus, deprived the agency of the benefits of the items for its operations. (Observation No. 7)



We recommended and Management agreed to coordinate with the PS-DBM for the reconciliation and delivery of supplies equivalent to the unliquidated balance, and/or refund any excess balance, when necessary. 



3)	Unserviceable property with book value of ₱0.589 million remained not disposed of, contrary to section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, thus, exposing them to further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value. (Observation No. 10)



We recommended and Management agreed to submit the IIRUP together with the complete supporting documents and facilitate disposal of the unserviceable PPE without further delay, pursuant to Section 79 of P.D. No. 1445.



4)	The GSIS personal share and loan payments of employees during the year amounting to ₱1.647 million and ₱1.446 million, respectively, were deducted properly but not remitted intact and on time, with delay ranging from 51 to 325 days, contrary to RA No. 8291, the GSIS Act of 1997.  Moreover, prior years’ balance amounting to ₱0.026 million remained unremitted as of year-end. (Observation No. 13)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant and the OIC, Human Resource Section to: 



a)	expedite the reconciliation of data, updating of salaries and processing of files of employees;



b)	exert diligent effort in the reconciliation of prior years’ balance; and 



b)	henceforth, remit promptly the amounts withheld to GSIS pursuant to the provisions of RA 8291 to avoid penal sanctions under Section 5 thereof.



5)	The agency allocated ₱25.742 million for its GAD programs and activities representing nine percent of the total appropriations of ₱286.467 million, in compliance with Section 31 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020.  However, the GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) was not submitted to the audit team as required under PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 2021, hence, audit of the GAD funds and programs was not undertaken. (Observation No. 18)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the GAD Focal Person to expedite the preparation and submission to the Audit Team of the AR pursuant to PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 for evaluation of the fund utilization and implementation of the GAD program and activities together with the supporting documents of the expenditures incurred in relation to GAD programs and activities.



6)	Payments of hazard pay granted to the concerned personnel of NFRDI amounting to ₱1.803 million lacked the required supporting documents contrary to Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001, thus the validity, completeness and propriety of the disbursements were doubtful. (Observation No. 23)



We recommended and Management agreed to submit the required supporting documents and require the Accounting Section to refrain from processing claims with incomplete documentation to avoid suspension in audit.



7)	Payment of Economic Relief Assistance amounting to ₱0.585 million to permanent employees without legal basis contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, thus, irregular and illegal. (Observation No. 24)



We recommended Management to enforce the immediate refund of the Economic Relief Assistance of ₱15,000.00 each from all recipients concerned, or in the total amount of ₱0.585 million which was granted without legal basis, otherwise such payment shall be disallowed in audit.



	The observations and recommendations were communicated with the agency officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda (AOMs) and discussed in an Exit Conference conducted on March 26, 2021 with concerned Management officials and staff. Management comments were considered in the report, where appropriate.



F. 	Enforcement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges



	There were no audit disallowances, suspensions and charges issued during the year.  Of the ₱3.976 million audit disallowances for prior years, only ₱0.859 million was settled, leaving an unsettled amount of ₱3.117 million as of the end of the year.



G. 	Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations



Out of the 21 prior years’ audit recommendations, 14 were implemented and seven (7) were not implemented, four (4) of which were reiterated with modifications.
