PART II



DETAILED AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



Financial Audit



We commend the Management through the Accountant for their prompt action in effecting the necessary adjustments on the improper recording of prior year’s transactions as part of the current year’s expenses.  Journal Entry Vouchers were prepared under the General Fund and Special Trust Fund in the amount of ₱769,463.35 and ₱3,453,587.14, respectively, under JEV Nos. 2020-12-013(GF) and 2020-12-030 (STF).



Audit observations and recommendations which still require further actions by the Management are discussed in the succeeding paragraphs:



1)	The recorded balance of ₱24.686 million as at December 31, 2020 for the Trust Liabilities account cannot be relied upon because of the following:



1.1 	The agency erroneously recorded the collections intended for the fiduciary and other fiduciary funds totaling ₱14.230 million as trust liabilities, contrary to Section 4, Chapter 5 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I.  The incorrect recording of the collections overstated the Trust Liabilities and understated the Income account of the University as at year-end.  



Chapter 5 of the GAM, Volume I, provides the standards, policies, guidelines and procedures in accounting for revenue and other receipts. Section 4 thereof, states that:



“Sec. 4. Special, Fiduciary and Trust Funds. Receipts shall be recorded as revenue of Special, Fiduciary or Trust Funds (TF) or Funds other than the GF, only when authorized by law and following such rules and regulations as may be issued by the Permanent Committee consisting of the Secretary of Finance as Chairman, and the Secretary of the Budget and the Chairman, Commission on Audit, as members. xxx” (underscoring supplied)



The Chairperson of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) issued CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 20, series of 2011 dated August 4, 2011 in accordance with the pertinent provisions of RA No. 7722 otherwise known as “Higher Education Act of 1994” setting forth the policies for the use of income and special trust fund and programs of receipts and expenditures of the State Universities and Colleges (SUCs).  



The guidelines in the classification of funds are provided under Section 4, Article II of  the CMO , to wit:



I)	Special Trust Fund (Tuition Fees, Service Income, Other Income etc.)

II)	Fiduciary Fund

III)	Other Fiduciary Funds

	a)	Self-Liquidating Units

	b)	Income Generating Projects/Units

	c)	Regular Trust Funds 



Moreover, Section 3, Article I of the CMO defines the above funds as follows:



1)	Special Trust Fund – refers to income of the SUC arising from collection of tuition fees, miscellaneous fees, service and other income. 



2)	Fiduciary Fund - funds to which collection of fees shall accrue.  This fund shall be used solely for the purpose for which it was authorized to be collected.  This includes athletic fee, cultural fee, computer fee, laboratory fee, shop fee, development fee, library fee and the like.  



3)	Income Generating Projects (IGPs) – refer to activities which generate additional revenues for the specific purpose for which it was created.  Administrative costs contribution of said projects shall be made to the extent of twenty-five (25%), to be automatically remitted for the use of the Administration.  

4)	Self-liquidating Units – refers to a unit which offer auxiliary services, primarily to internal clients and, secondarily, to external clients of the SUC. Self-liquidating units are usually managed by the units whose functions are aligned with the program under their supervision (example: in some SUCs without Advanced Education budget from the GAA, the Graduate School is a self-liquidating unit under the management of the SUC)



5)	Regular Trust Funds – refers to a fund which is governed by law as NSTP (NSTP Law), ROTC (ROTC Law), Publication, SSG, Alumni Funds and the like provided under R.A. 8292.  However, the funds for NSTP and ROTC are integrated depository account of the Special Trust Fund.



Also, based on the information as culled from the comment of the OIC-SUC President stated in Finding No. 6 of the CY 2016 AAR, the Graduate School (masteral and doctoral programs), as the university’s mandated service under the Advanced Higher Education, is considered a major function. Hence, the more reason that it should be recorded as revenue and not as trust liability.



Analysis revealed that the account “Trust Liabilities” under the Special Trust Fund (STF) and the Miscellaneous Trust Fund (MTF) registered a total balance of ₱24,686,029.92 as of December 31, 2020, with details shown in Annex A.  



The funds classified under Fiduciary Funds and Other Fiduciary Funds (i.e. Self-Liquidating Units, Income Generating Projects and Regular Trust Funds) are clearly defined as such in the CMO No. 20, series 2011.  The fiduciary funds totaled ₱14,229,722.28 as of December 31, 2020. The details are shown on the next page:

Verification of the General Ledger for the account Trust Liabilities disclosed that in January 2020 a total of ₱496,203.00 was credited to the account.  The amount was traced back to the Detailed Collection Report (generated from the Student Information System), the Cash Receipts Journal (CRJ) and to the respective Subsidiary Ledgers, summarized as follows:

It was gathered that most of the recorded amounts are collections representing various fiduciary funds from the enrolled students in the different colleges/departments of the university. 



Some other fiduciary fund collections received in January 2020 representing payments of advisers’ fee (doctoral/masteral), affiliation fee, Ang Suga publication, cultural fee, ethics review fee, museum, NSTP and SSC were randomly verified from the ORs and found to have been recorded as trust liabilities.  The same were traced to the corresponding JEVs (for the day) and to the Detailed Collection Report, to wit:

It was further learned that the account “Trust Liabilities” is credited when the university bills the CHED with the tuition and other school fees of students under the government’s “free tuition fee” program.  The billing is supported with the List of Qualified Students and their corresponding amounts of tuition fee and other miscellaneous fees.  



On June 22, 2020, JEV No. 2020-06-008 was drawn to record a receivable from CHED totaling ₱17,825,764.50. Of the total amount billed, ₱899,080.00 was credited to Trust Liabilities representing medical, SSC and cultural fees. The journal entry to record the amount billed to CHED is shown on the next page:

On the other hand, several fiduciary funds totaling ₱5.291 million were erroneously recorded in the books of the Miscellaneous Trust Fund (MTF) despite the issuance of the CMO No. 20, which specifies that the identified income should be booked under the Special Trust Fund (STF).



The erroneous recognition of the fiduciary funds as trust liability is contrary to the stipulations under Section 4, Chapter 5 of the GAM Vol. I.  Thus, the reliability of the accounts involved namely; Trust Liabilities and Revenue (accumulated through the years) are materially affected.  It likewise forestalls the use of the funds, which could help improve agency operations, as it is not made available for appropriations or expenditure in accordance with law.  



Additionally, all expenses disbursed out of the trust liability account could not be considered legal as it basically contradicts the provision of the law that states -“No money shall be paid out of any public treasury or depository except in pursuance of an appropriation law or other specific statutory authority.”



For instance, the disbursement under Check No. 68679608 dated February 26, 2020 for MTF DV No. 2020-02-040 dated November 21, 2019 in the amount of P25,129.69 (net of tax), which was paid to Southpole Central Hotel, representing payment of one lot meal and accommodation for the turn-over ceremony and team building activity (on November 16-17, 2019) of Ang Suga editorial board and speakers was debited to the Trust Liability account. There was no BOR-approved appropriation or expenditure for the activity, as the collections for Ang Suga were previously lodged as Trust Liability account, thus the correct expense account could not be recorded.



	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to make detailed review (to include those recorded under the MTF) of the trust liability account, as most of these collections were made as early as October 2015, and prepare the journal entries to correct/adjust the affected accounts.  Henceforth, ensure that all collections for fiduciary funds are recorded as revenue pursuant to Section 4, Chapter 5 of the GAM Volume 1 on the Receipts of Special, Fiduciary and Trust Funds, and make it available for appropriation or expenditure in accordance with the law, rules and regulations.



Management commented that the audit recommendation has been considered as a welcome development not just on the part of the Finance Office but of the entire system in general as the matters involving collection and use of income was already clarified.



They further commented that the Chief Administrative Officer for Finance initiated a meeting with the Vice President for Academic Affairs, the Deans of the respective colleges and Integrated Laboratory School (ILS) Supervisor.  Among the topics discussed were the effects on budgeting and utilization of the funds in the ensuing year if the funds will be treated as income of the University. It was emphasized in the meeting that expenses pertinent to payment of honoraria, travelling and per diem for OJT preceptors, affiliation and users fee for base hospitals shall have a corresponding appropriation to support its disbursement. The Academic Heads were advised to include in their budget proposal expenses related to the course specific fees.



In partial compliance with the audit observation, adjusting entries of the Trust Liability accounts in the STF, IGP and MTF were reclassified to Accumulated Surplus, as follows:

	1)	Trust Liabilities account under the Miscellaneous Trust Fund (MTF) totaling ₱6.658 million remained inactive for several years and without valid contracts/agreements to establish mutual obligations, thus rendering the account unreliable and doubtful.



Liabilities, as defined under Section 2, Chapter I, GAM, Volume I, are firm obligations of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying economic benefits or service potential.



Trust Liabilities, on the other hand, is described under Chapter 3, GAM Vol. III as:



	Account Title 	Trust Liabilities

	Account Number	20401010

	Normal Balance 	Credit

	Description 	This account is used to recognize the receipt of amount held in trust for specific purpose. Debit this account for payment or settlement of the liability.



Examination of the Trust Liabilities account under the MTF revealed that several sub-accounts totaling ₱6,658,057.99 were not supported with valid authority or signed agreements to establish the obligations/requirements between the university and the other contracting party.  The same accounts were considered inactive as the balances were observed to be the same since CY 2015.  The details are as follows:

Verification of records disclosed that the accounts under the MTF Trust Liabilities were part of the adjusting entry under General Journal Entry No. 11 for the month of July 2017 amounting ₱15,387,815.58, which reclassified the fiduciary account balances as of December 31, 2015 originally entered as Other Payables account to the Trust Liability account, both under the MTF books.  The accounts were adjusted without the valid document to support its existence and legality. 



Aside from the incorrect entry in taking up as trust liabilities, these accounts should not be recorded under the MTF books.  Thus, rendering the trust liability account unreliable and doubtful.



We recommended and Management agreed to secure the necessary documents to support the legality and existence of the obligations/requirements of this account, and prepare the necessary adjusting journal entry to transfer the same from MTF books to STF books.



Management commented that the Accountant has instructed the concerned bookkeepers to use the appropriate account titles such as School Fees and Other Service Income in drawing the Journal Entry Vouchers.  The Accounting Office has also designed account codes for the sub-accounts and established Subsidiary Ledgers in compliance with the audit recommendation.



On the dormant Trust Liabilities aggregating P6.658 million, Management committed that they will secure certifications that the University have no existing obligations from all their identified partner agencies, like the hospitals, so that these inactive accounts can be reverted to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account.



2)	The reliability of  the account Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) with total balance of ₱3.028 million as at December 31, 2020 is doubtful due to: (a) the erroneous deposits made to the bank account of the Bureau of Treasury (BTr); (b) charging a portion of the retention fee released to the contractor without any written/valid agreement to recognize the account; and (c) the recording of transactions as inter-agency receivable is not in accordance with Item 03 (Inter-Agency Receivables), Chapter 3, Annex A of COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 on the Revised Chart of Accounts for NGAs.

 

Review of the “Due from NGAs-BTr” account in the MTF and STF books registered a total balance of ₱3,028,155.24 as of December 31, 2020.  It was noted that the recorded transactions were already dormant for two to three years as these were taken up in the books in CYs 2017 and 2018.   It is composed of the following:

Analysis and validation of entries affecting the account revealed that in CYs 2017 and 2018 several adjustments were made to record the erroneous deposits made to the bank account of the BTr.  These deposits represent return of unused account in the books does not have any transaction in CYs 2019 and CY 2020.

The error occurred in the deposit of the refund, which could have been attributed to the erroneous indication of the type of fund in the OR. For example, it is indicated in the OR as MDS when actually it is not. So, instead of depositing them to the bank account maintained in DBP for STF and for MTF, the said collections were erroneously deposited to the DBP BTr MDS Account of which corrections through fund transfer could not be made as CNU has no access to the latter’s account.  The transactions were recorded in the books as receivable by debiting the account Due from NGAs-BTr.  The collections of erroneous deposits are remote as these were never communicated with the said agency.



Further analysis and validation disclosed that another adjustment was made to the account in August 2018.  Journal Entry Voucher No. 006 dated August 29, 2018 was drawn as follows:

To recall, the construction of the 7-storey Teaching Arts Centrum (TAC) Building was sourced from three funds, e.g. General Appropriations Act of 2013 (General Fund), Special Trust Fund (STF), and the DAP Funds downloaded from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and taken up under the Miscellaneous Trust Fund (MTF). It was further verified that the 10 percent retention fee in the amount of ₱1,180,000.00 and ₱1,608,320.08 (totaled ₱2,788,320.08) was deducted from the 1st and 2nd billing, respectively, of building construction. These billings were paid out of the General Fund.  



Management explained that when Phase 1 of the construction was completed on June 18, 2015 with total cost of ₱93,419,847.10, the related cash allocations for the retention fee in the GF lapsed.  The corresponding cash under the GF was no longer available, thus, the actual release of the 10 percent retention fee was all charged against the MTF amounting ₱4,670,992.00.  It was paid under MTF DV No. 4201509 dated September 18, 2015 and MTF Check No. 47329093 of same date with summary as follows:

As the amount of ₱2,788,320.08 was retained under the General Fund (GF) when it was billed, the accountant realized that it should have been charged to that fund (GF) and not against the Miscellaneous Trust Fund.  To effect the correction, JEV No. 006 dated August 29, 2018 was drawn to record a receivable from the BTr (General Fund) in the MTF books of said amount.



The same amount, together with the erroneous deposits, is reported under Annex D on the Status of Other Receivables, a reportorial requirement under COA Memo 2017-010 dated May 15, 2017 on the Restatement with Amendment of All Issuances Governing Submission of Status Reports of Unliquidated Cash Advances, Fund Transfers and Other Receivables.



The Due from NGAs account, as an Inter-Agency Receivable, is described under Chapter 3, Annex A, Volume III of COA Circular 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 on the Description of Accounts, as follows:



Account Title 

Account Number 

Normal Balance 

Description 

Due from National Government Agencies 

10303010 

Debit 

This account is debited to recognize advances for purchase of goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers to the NGAs for implementation of projects and other receivables from NGAs. This account is credited upon receipt of goods/services, liquidation of fund transfers, receipt of payment, settlement, write-off, and/or adjustments.



In this situation, the recognition of the receivable in the books may not be proper as the other party (BTr) does not have knowledge on the adjustment.  The same was not communicated in order to arrange the possibility of re-funding.



The propriety and existence of the receivable is still doubtful until there is a mutual understanding on its nature and certainty of the transactions between the CNU and BTr.  Additionally, the account may not be reflective of the true situation as there was never a transfer of fund from the CNU for the BTr to liquidate. 



Also, the corresponding credit to the Guaranty/Security Payable  in the same amount is not proper because, as far as the contractor is concerned, the payable was already closed when the retention fee was fully released in 2015.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to coordinate or communicate with BTr for possible reconciliation, and to make a funding request especially on the returned retention fee to the contractor, which was charged to MTF, instead of the GF.  If collection is remote, make the necessary adjusting journal entry to correct the affected accounts (Due From NGAs-BTr and Guaranty/Security Payable).



 We further recommended that Management review the control processes in the collections and deposits and cautiously check the journal entries made including the attachments in order to avoid occurrence of same nature. 



	Management committed to communicate with the BTr on the erroneous deposits made by the University to the bank account of BTR.  Appropriate action will be done once the University will receive a reply from the said agency.  On the charging of the retention fee from an erroneous fund, the Accounting Office has started to make reconciliation on its funding and disbursements.  There are still data especially on the funding aspect that need further verification. Also, on the error in recording as inter-agency receivable, the audit observation was noted by Management.



Compliance Audit 



3)	The Cebu Normal University opened/maintained a current account in a private bank with deposit balance of ₱0.759 million as at December 31, 2020 without the written authority from the duly authorized official of the Bureau of Treasury (BTr)/Department of Finance (DOF) contrary to the stipulations provided in Section 2 (5.2.1) of DOF Department Circular No. 01-2017 dated May 1, 2017.    



DOF Department Circular No. 01-2017 dated May 1, 2017 was issued to amend the guidelines on Authorized Government Depository Banks set forth under Department Circular No. 001-2015 dated June 1, 2015.

	

Section 2 of said Circular No. 01-2017 provides as follows:



“Section 2. Section 5.2 of Department Circular No. 01-2015, as amended, is hereby amended to read as follows:



“5.2  NGAs, GOCCs and LGUs, specifically allowed by law, rules and regulations to retain income and/or for operations and/or working balances, shall deposit and maintain Government Funds with any of the following banks:



a)	Land Bank of the Philippines;

b)	Development Bank of the Philippines;

c)	Philippine Postal Savings Bank;

d)	Al Amanah Islamic Investment Bank of the Philippines

e)	United Coconut Planters Bank – authorized to accept…

f)	Philippine Veterans Bank- authorized to accept funds from…



5.2.1 NGAs and GOCCs shall secure written authority to open deposit accounts and/or deposit Government Funds from the duly authorized official of the BTr/DOF in all banks, including those listed in Section 5.2, in accordance with relevant laws, issuances and regulations of the BSP.  NGAs and GOCCs shall submit a notarized waiver: (i) allowing the BTr/DOF to examine, inquire or look into… (emphasis ours)



5.2.2 Subject to the existence of any circumstances…

Verification of the Cash in Bank account as of August 31, 2020 revealed that the University opened a current account with the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) on August 7, 2020.  The initial opening deposit of ₱10,000.00 was drawn from the Special Trust Fund (STF) Check No. 69530423 dated August 5, 2020 under DV No. 2020-08-0316 dated August 4, 2020.  The DV was not supported with a Budget Utilization Request and Status (BURS).



The opening of account in a private bank was endorsed by the Administrative Council through its Resolution No. 2020-51 dated June 29, 2020. The Board of Regents (BOR) issued and approved BOR Resolution No. 31, series of 2020 on July 15, 2020 authorizing the university to open and maintain current account denominated in Philippine Peso or any Foreign Currency with the Bank of the Philippine Islands.  The resolution also authorized the school to issue any and all checks, drafts, transfer orders, debit and credit advice, application for manager’s checks/certified checks and other types of payment orders and instructions drawn upon or payable out of said bank account.



	Inquiry with the Finance Management Division (FMD) disclosed that amidst the COVID19 pandemic, the University sees the need to open a current account with a private bank to facilitate the collection of Tuition and Other School Fees in the New Normal. They reasoned that it allows the clients to make payments through Instapay and other accredited payment centers which are not part of the services of the existing government banks.  



However, no certification from the LBP and DBP (Cebu Branches where the school maintains its bank account) was attached to confirm the non-availability of the said services.  It was also noticed that the initial deposit to said private bank was not supported with a written authority from the authorized official of the BTr/DOF. 



A written authority to open an account or deposit the government funds with private bank/s must be secured from the duly authorized official of the BTr/DOF pursuant to Section 2 (5.2.1) of DOF Circular No. 01-2017 dated May 1, 2017.



	We recommended and Management agreed to secure written authority from the duly authorized official of the BTr/DOF on whatever appropriate options/methods of collecting fees outside of the authorized government depository banks as required under Section 2 (5.2.1) of DOF Department Circular No. 01-2017 dated May 1, 2017.  



Management explained that the reason for their opening of account with BPI is for the students to deposit their school fees with the said bank.  The choice of the said bank was based on the service available which is, an access to their account online.  With the said facility, it is easy for them to validate payments since transactions are real time.  This facility is allegedly not available in DBP since they have no access to their account online.  Validation of the students’ payments would take time since the Cashier still needs to go to the bank to have their passbook updated. 



In compliance with the audit observation, Management has already requested an authority from the BTr to allow them to maintain an account with BPI.  However, the request was denied for the reason that there are government banks accessible in the vicinity of the University.  Another option which the BTr is allegedly open for consideration is for the University to engage the services of financial technology companies. The BTr has given clearance to them provided that a tripartite agreement between BTR, CNU and the financial technology company be linked in accordance with the pro-forma MOA of the BTr. However, the University is not so keen on the tripartite MOA since it appears that payments will be remitted to BTR.  They will have to communicate again with BTr to request that the MOA should be between the University and the biller company only.  This is because the University is a stand-alone agency and they are authorized to collect income from school fees which will form part of their Special Trust Fund.



4)	Honoraria for faculty members of the Graduate School were paid in excess of the computed Prime Hourly Teaching Rate (PHTR) prescribed under Sections 7.13.1.2.2 and 7.13.1.2.3, Chapter VII, Manual on Position Classification and Compensation issued by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), resulting in the overpayment totaling ₱573,138.51 for the period covering January 2020 to August 2020.



Section 7.13.1.2, Chapter VII of the Manual on Position Classification and Compensation issued by the DBM provides the computation of additional compensation for faculty in the graduate program.  The prescribed rates are as follows:



a)	For faculty members with Masters degrees: 



PHTR= 0.0014 AR----footnote1----



b)	For faculty members with Doctorate degrees:



PHTR- 0.0015 AR

			

The University, under its Advance Education Program, offered masteral and doctoral studies of specific interests in its different colleges i.e. College of Nursing (CN), College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) and College of Teacher Education (CTE). Instructions under these studies are conducted by qualified faculty members, deans and some university officials.  The qualified instructors are remunerated with honoraria because the related teaching loads are outside of their regular office hours.  The honoraria are charged against the General Fund (GF) and the Special Trust Fund (STF). The payment of same honoraria (as additional compensation) is based on the rate/computation set forth under the Manual on Position Classification and Compensation issued by the DBM as stated in the previous page.  



However, in the post-audit of disbursements for honoraria, we noticed that some instructors were paid in excess of the computed PHTR.  



For purposes of showing the excess payment of honoraria, we selected as samples the honoraria for the month of January 2020 of two graduate school professors occupying the position of Instructor I (SG 12) with masteral degree, while the other professor of the same position has a doctorate degree. Computation of excess payments is shown below:

The payments of the honoraria for the months of January 2020 to August 2020 were consistently paid in excess of the formula provided in the aforestated provisions of the DBM-issued manual with total overpayment of ₱573,138.51.  Please refer to Annex B for complete details. 



We were further informed that an amendment to the payment scheme of Graduate School honoraria was proposed during the meeting of the University’s Technical Working Group (TWG) and Academic Council on October 22, 2018 and December 11, 2018, respectively. The TWG and the Council recommended that the honoraria payment scheme for both resident and non-resident faculty will be based on PHTR of National Budget Circular (NBC) 461 Cycle 6 SSL4 3rd Tranche with a rate not below ₱600.00/hour and not more than P1,000/hour applicable for both doctorate and master’s degree holder.



The proposal was approved on February 7, 2019 under BOR Resolution No. 18  series of 2019, thus the payment of honoraria at PHTR of ₱600.00 (as the minimum) even if the computed PHTR per DBM’s manual is way lesser. 



Also, NBC 461 was issued to establish and prescribe rules and regulations governing the implementation of the Revised Compensation and Position Classification Plan for faculty positions in SUCs, HEIs and TEIs in accordance with the modified Common Criteria for Evaluation (CCE) of faculty positions.  The amendment to the computation of the PHTR was not mentioned in the same circular.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to abide with the computation of PHTR in accordance with Sections 7.13.1.2.2 and 7.13.1.2.3, Chapter VII of the Manual on Position Classification and Compensation issued by the DBM in order to avoid overpayments and disallowance in audit.  Other basis of computations should be aligned with established guidelines of the DBM and other competent authority. 



Management submitted to the Audit Team BOR Resolution No. 60, series of 2020 dated October 22, 2020 approving the honorarium scheme of the faculty members who are teaching in the Graduate School at PHTR following NBC No. 461 Cycle 7 SSL 5 (First Tranche) but not more than ₱1,000.00, effective SY 2020-2021.



Management further asserted that they have been using the PHTR rate prescribed by DBM.  However, they used the minimum and maximum rates provided in the board resolutions. With the issuance of AOM, Dr. Tradio said the claims for 1st Semester SY 2020-2021 were already corrected.



COVID-19 Audit



5)	The payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay to the security personnel engaged through Institutional Contract of Service (COS) is inconsistent with Item 3.6 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-01 dated March 24, 2020 and Item 6.1.4 of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2017, thus incurring irregular expenditures of ₱0.959 million.



Proclamation No. 922 (series of 2020) declared the whole country under a State of Public Health Emergency due to COVID-19 outbreak.  Relative thereto, Administrative Order (AO) No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 authorizes the grant of hazard pay in an amount not exceeding ₱500.00 per day per person to government employees and workers engaged through COS or job order (JO), whose services are urgently necessary and who physically report for work during the period of an Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) due to exposure to health risks and hazards.



In view thereof, supplemental guidelines were issued by DBM in the implementation on the grant of the COVID-19 hazard pay.  Accordingly, DBM and COA issued interim guidelines governing COS and JO workers in government for the duration of the State of Calamity and Community Quarantine due to the COVID-19.  The salient provisions relative to our audit observation are hereby quoted:



Circular

Provision

DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-01 dated  March 24, 2020 on the Guidelines on the Grant of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay

3.0 Coverage



The guidelines and conditions in this Circular shall cover the following:



3.1. . .

3.2. . .

3.3. . .

3.4. . .

3.5. . . 

3.6	Workers engaged through COS, JO, or other similar schemes.



COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2020 dated March 19, 2020 on the Interim Guidelines Governing Contract of Service and Job Order Workers in Government for the Duration of the State of Calamity and Community Quarantine Due to the Corona Virus Disease 

2.0   Scope and Coverage



This Joint Circular shall cover all COS and JO workers whose services are directly engaged by Departments, Bureaus, Offices, and Agencies of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices, SUCs, GOCCs, and LWDs for the duration of the State of Calamity and Community Quarantine due to the COVID-19.



xxx…



Institutional COS workers assigned in government agencies to provide services such as janitorial, security, consultancy and other support services are excluded from the coverage of the Joint Circular. (emphasis ours)





Verification of the disbursement vouchers and the related supporting documents revealed that the University granted COVID-19 hazard pay to outsourced personnel providing security services for the period March 28 to July 31, 2020 in the amount of ₱959,000.00. The payment was made through Café Security and Agency Inc. under DV No. 2020-08-0676 dated August 12, 2020. 

	

The DBM Circular clearly stipulate that the grant of COVID-19 hazard pay covers only to government employees and COS or JO workers whose services are directly engaged by government agencies.    It does not include Institutional COS workers assigned in government agencies to provide services such as janitorial, security, consultancy and other support services.  Hence, payment of COVID-19 hazard pay to the security personnel of Café Security and Agency Inc. amounting to ₱959,000.00 is considered irregular expenses. 



As a reminder, Item 6.1.4 of CSC-COA-DBM JC No. 1, s. 2017 on the subject: Rules and Regulations Governing Contract of Service and Job Order Workers in the Government, states:

	

	“6.1	Institutional Contract of Service

			

As a general rule, government agencies may avail of outsourced services through institutional contract of service, subject to the following conditions:



6.1.1. . .

6.1.2. . .

6.1.3. . .

6.1.4	The contractor or service provider shall be responsible for providing the workers with compensation and benefits compliant with existing labor law including the necessary social security and other benefits mandated by law in addition to the direct compensation as payment for their services.

	

We recommended and Management agreed to demand from the concerned security agency a refund for the payment of hazard pay to its security personnel totaling ₱959,000.00 for the period covered March 28 to July 31, 2020. Likewise, ensure that the COVID-19 hazard pay shall be granted only to those authorized to receive the said grant in accordance with the guidelines issued by DBM and COA.    



Management informed that Audit Team that they had already conducted a meeting with the contracted parties of Institutional Contract of Services informing them of the audit observation which necessitates refund of the hazard pay granted to them by the University.



6)	The grant of COVID-19 Hazard Pay to 18 employees of the University was not in accordance with the guidelines set in Items 4.3 and 4.4 of Budget Circular No. 2020-01 dated March 24, 2020.  



Verification of the financial transactions pertaining to the payment of COVID-19 hazard pay to the University personnel during the ECQ period revealed the following deficiencies:



a)	Fourteen personnel were granted with COVID-19 hazard pay even though these were not supported with authority from the head of the agency allowing them to physically report for work at their respective offices on particular dates.



Items 4.3 and 4.4 of Budget Circular No. 2020-01 provides that: 	



“4.3	The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribe official working hours by the head of agency/office during the period of implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine measures in the area of such office or work station.





4.4	The total rate of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay shall be based on the number of days an employee/worker physically reports for work during the Enhanced Community Quarantine period using the formula under Item 4.1 hereof.” 



 Post-audit of the disbursements revealed that there were claims for COVID-19 hazard pay totaling ₱21,000.00 which were not supported with necessary authority from the head of the agency allowing its personnel to physically render service at their respective offices or work stations. The computation of the said claim was based only on the number of days reflected in the Daily Time Record (DTR) of the concerned employees, as attached in the Disbursement Voucher (DV), multiplied by the allowed rate of ₱500.00 per day. The actual number of days authorized by the head of the agency for them to physically report in their work stations were not considered in its computation. Details of the noted deficiency are shown in the table below:

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accounting Office to submit to the Audit Team the required authority from the Head of Agency, for further audit/evaluation. Also, ensure that the grant of COVID-19 hazard pay shall be adequately supported with prior authority from the head of the agency as required under the DBM Budget Circular.



Management commented that they are in the process of retrieving the required authority to physically report to Office on the dates specified and will submit it to the Audit Team. If found that these personnel have no authority, then they would be required to refund.



b)	Four employees were granted COVID-19 hazard pay even though they did not physically report for work during the period of ECQ.



Verification of the supporting documents showed that three employees had reported physically to the office for lesser number of days compared to what was paid to them as hazard pay. In another instance, one employee who was on WFH arrangement was still granted hazard pay. This condition does not conform with Item 4.4 of Budget Circular No. 2020-1 which requires that the computation for hazard pay should be based on the actual number of days the employee is authorized to physically report for work multiplied by the allowed rate of not more than ₱500.00/day per person, hence, resulting in the overpayment of COVID-19 hazard pay by ₱2,500.00, with details as follows:

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned employees to refund the corresponding amount of overpayment of the hazard pay, and to ensure that only those University personnel who physically reported to their work stations during the ECQ period will be granted with COVID-19 hazard pay in accordance with the existing guidelines.



Management explained that they are still coordinating with the Human Resources and Management Office to determine whether the subject payees did not physically report to the workplace on the dates specified.  If found in order, then these personnel will be instructed to make the necessary refund. 



Gender and Development (GAD)



The GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for CY 2020 is still below the mandated GAD allocation of at least five percent of the total agency appropriations under the GAA.  The University appropriated only ₱13.333 million for the GAD programs and activities in CY 2020 or 4.30 percent of the total GAA appropriations of ₱310,088,000.00.



Moreover, copy of the GPB and Accomplishment Reports for CY 2019 and 2020 were submitted to the Audit Team through e-mail but said documents lacked the signatures of the OIC-GAD Coordinator, as the preparer and the University President, as the approving official. There was also no proof of endorsement of the GPB to the PCW.



Compliance with Tax Laws

	

The Cebu Normal University (CNU) has substantially complied with the tax laws on withholding of income tax from compensation and Value-Added Tax (VAT) and Percentage Tax (PT) on goods and services purchased. The taxes withheld in 2020 were remitted regularly to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).
