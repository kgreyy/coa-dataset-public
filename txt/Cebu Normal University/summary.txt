EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)	INTRODUCTION



The <a href="http://www.cnuedu.blogspot.com/">Cebu Normal University</a> (CNU) was established in 1902 as the Cebu Normal School, a provincial normal school and a branch of the Philippine Normal School. With the passage of RA 5128 in 1967, Cebu Normal School was renamed Cebu Normal College.  In 1976, it was converted into a state college by virtue of Presidential Decree 944. 



The school attained a university status on June 27, 1998 and was named Cebu Normal University pursuant to R.A. 8688. It has two (2) extension campuses located in the Municipalities of Balamban and Medellin, both in the Province of Cebu.  As mandated by law, the University shall perform the following functions:



--	Primarily provide higher professional and special instructions for special purposes and promote research and extension services, advanced studies, and progressive leadership in education and other fields as may be relevant.



--	Offer undergraduate, graduate and short-term courses within its area of specialization and according to its capabilities as the Board of Regents may deem necessary to carry out its objectives particularly in order to meet the needs of the province and the country.



--	Continue to operate a reasonably-sized laboratory school within the campus.



--	Adopt public elementary and secondary schools in the city and the province of Cebu to serve as pilot centers for teaching-learning strategies and approaches so operated and maintained under the appropriate memorandum of agreement between the university and the Department of Education.



The administration of the University and the exercise of its corporate powers are vested exclusively in the Board of Regents and the State University and College (SUC) President as authorized by the Board.  Dr. Filomena T. Dayagbil is the SUC President effective February 2, 2017 up to February 1, 2021 and remains as Officer-in-Charge until a new SUC President will be appointed.

E)	SCOPE OF AUDIT



The audit covered the financial transactions and operations of the CNU for Calendar Year 2020. The objectives of the audit were primarily to: (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on management assertions on the financial statements;  (b) review on a test basis, the propriety of disbursements and other financial transactions to determine whether or not the transactions were made in accordance with existing laws, rules and regulations and recommend agency improvement opportunities thereon; and  (c) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.  



The general audit instructions for the audit of the CY 2020 accounts and transactions of State Universities and Colleges were likewise considered, when applicable.



F)	AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



	The Auditor expressed a qualified opinion on the financial statements of the University due to the various audit exceptions, which are discussed in detail in Part II of the herein report, as follows: 



1)	The recorded balance of ₱24.686 million as at December 31, 2020 for the Trust Liabilities account cannot be relied upon because of the following:



	a)	The agency erroneously recorded the collections intended for the fiduciary and other fiduciary funds totaling ₱14.230 million as trust liabilities, contrary to Section 4, Chapter 5 of the Government Accounting Manual, Volume I.  The incorrect recording of the collections overstated the Trust Liabilities and understated the Income account of the University as at year-end.  



	b)	Trust Liabilities account under the Miscellaneous Trust Fund totaling ₱6.658 million remained inactive for several years and without valid contracts/agreements to establish mutual obligations, thus rendering the account unreliable and doubtful.



2)	The reliability of  the account Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) with total balance of ₱3.028 million as at December 31, 2020 is doubtful due to: (a) the erroneous deposits made to the bank account of the Bureau of Treasury (BTr); (b) charging a portion of the retention fee released to the contractor without any written/valid agreement to recognize the account; (c) the recording of transactions as inter-agency receivable is not in accordance with Item 03 (Inter-Agency Receivables), Chapter 3, Annex A of COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 on the Revised Chart of Accounts for NGAs.  













G)	SIGNIFICANT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



In addition, the following are the significant observations and recommendations in the audit and/or evaluation of the operations of CNU for CY 2020 . These and other audit observations are fully discussed in Part II of this Report:



1)	The Cebu Normal University opened/maintained a current account  in a private bank with  deposit balance of ₱0.759 million as at December 31, 2020 without the written authority from the duly authorized official of the Bureau of Treasury/Department of Finance (DOF) contrary to the stipulations provided in Section 2 (5.2.1) of DOF Department Circular No. 01-2017 dated May 1, 2017.    



		We recommended and   Management agreed to secure written authority from the duly authorized official of the BTr/DOF as required under Section 2 (5.2.1) of DOF Department Circular No. 01-2017.

	

2)	Honoraria for faculty members of the Graduate School were paid in excess of the computed Prime Hourly Teaching Rate (PHTR) prescribed under Sections 7.13.1.2.2 and 7.13.1.2.3, Chapter VII, Manual on Position Classification and Compensation issued by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), resulting in the overpayment totaling ₱573,138.51 for the period covering January 2020 to August 2020.

	  

We recommended and Management agreed to require the accountant to abide with the computation of PHTR in accordance with Sections 7.13.1.2.2 and 7.13.1.2.3, Chapter VII of the Manual on Position Classification and Compensation issued by the DBM in order to avoid overpayments and disallowance in audit.  Other basis of computations should be aligned with established guidelines of the DBM and other competent authority. 



3)	The payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay to the security personnel engaged through Institutional Contract of Service (COS) is inconsistent with Item 3.6 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-01 dated March 24, 2020 and Item 6.1.4 of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2017, thus incurring irregular expenditures of ₱0.959 million.



We recommended and Management agreed to demand from the concerned security agency a refund for the payment of hazard pay to its security personnel totaling ₱959,000.00 for the period covered March 28 to July 31, 2020. Likewise, ensure that the COVID-19 hazard pay shall be granted only to those authorized to receive the said grant in accordance with the guidelines issued by DBM and COA.    



4)	The grant of COVID-19 Hazard Pay to 18 employees of the University was not in accordance with the guidelines set in Items 4.3 and 4.4 of Budget Circular No. 2020-01 dated March 24, 2020.  

	

	

	

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accounting Office to submit to the Audit Team the required authority from the Head of Agency, for further audit/evaluation, and to ensure that the grant of COVID-19 hazard pay shall be adequately supported with prior authority from the head of the agency as required under the DBM Budget Circular.



We also recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned employees to refund the corresponding amount of overpayment of hazard pay, and to ensure that only those University personnel who physically reported to their work stations during the ECQ period will be granted with COVID-19 hazard pay in accordance with the existing guidelines.
