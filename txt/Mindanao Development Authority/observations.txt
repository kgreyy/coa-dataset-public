PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





Non-submission of RPCPPE



1.	Non-submission of the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) contravened Section 38, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), thus determining the PPE’s existence, serviceable conditions and accuracy of the balance of P18,245,842.86 as at December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained.

Pertinent provision of Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I provides that:



Section 38. Physical Count of PPE.  The entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 73) as at December 31 of each year.  This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year.  Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording.



The Agency’s Statement of Financial Position as at December 31, 2020 showed an aggregate balance of P18,245,842.86 for assets recorded under various Property, Plant and Equipment accounts, as follows:

During the Calendar Year (CY) 2019, the Agency conducted the physical count of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and submitted the partial Report of Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE). In CY 2020, the Management was able to submit an electronic copy of the RPCPPE as at December 31, 2019. Initial observations noted on the submitted RPCPPEs as at CY 2019 were already communicated to the Management via electronic mail on November 12, 2020; however, the revised RPCPPE was not submitted to the COA Auditor’s Office as of this writing. Further, the Management was not able to submit the RPCPPE as at December 31, 2020 within the prescribed period under Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I.



Our validation revealed that the Inventory Committee already initiated annual physical count of PPE; however, no request letter from the Inventory Committee was received by the COA Audit Team to witness the inventory-taking.

It must be noted that Section V of COA Circular No. 80-124 dated January 18, 1980 requires the witnessing of the Auditor on the inventory-taking:



V.	GUIDELINES FOR INVENTORY-TAKING:



1.	Creation of Inventory Committee



A committee shall be formed to take charge of the physical inventory-taking, consisting of two or more employees designated by the head of the agency including the property/administrative officer or custodian depending on the extent of his accountability. A representative of the Auditor shall witness the inventory-taking. (Emphasis provided)



The non-submission of the related RPCPPEs has precluded Management and the Audit Team from identifying whether reported PPE items in the books as adjusted were indeed existing, as well as monitoring their present conditions. 

It is emphasized that the physical inventory-taking which is required annually should be regarded with importance as it is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of proper custodianship.

The aforementioned conditions cast doubt as to the existence, serviceable conditions and accuracy of the PPE accounts which are not in compliance with Section 38, Chapter 10- Property, Plant and Equipment of the GAM, Volume I and Section V of COA Circular No. 80-124.





Recommendations:



We therefore recommended that management:



	a.	Direct Inventory Committee to prepare the RPCPPE as prescribed in Appendix 73, Volume II of the GAM and to submit the same to the COA Office;

	

	b.	Inform and/or invite a representative of the COA through a request letter to serve as witness in the conduct of annual physical count of PPE; and

	

		c.	Strictly observe the time frame for the conduct of annual physical count of PPE at the end of every year and the corresponding RPCPPE is submitted to the Auditor not later than January 31 of the following year.

	

			Management’s Comment:



		During the exit conference, the Management said that they already directed the Inventory Committee to conduct a physical count of PPE and to prepare the corresponding RPCPPE as at December 31, 2020. Further, they will send the letter to COA Office once the schedule of the said activity is set. However, the Management informed the Audit Team that the physical count on MinDA Davao City Office shall be limited to the PPE located in the temporary Office at the Ritz Garden Oases, Davao City and the PPEs used by the MINDA Officials and staffs who are working from home. This is because the Old Airport Building, which is adjacent to the MINDA Office where most of the MinDA Properties are being stored, still operates as the COVID 19 Quarantine Facility. The Management further informed the COA that the annual physical count was not done and hard to complete because of the unplanned Office Transfer of MinDA as well as the restrictions being observed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the physical count conducted recently by the Property Management Unit was to account all PPE, supplies and materials which was transferred from MinDA Office, Old Airport Building to the temporary Office and those items being used by Officials who are working from home; as well as to facilitate the record reconciliation and proper assignment of accountabilities over the transferred PPE and other items. Hence, it was not considered as a final physical count. The annual physical count involving Inventory Committee and COA representative shall be done within the first quarter of CY 2021. Nevertheless, the Management assured the Audit Team that they will strictly observe the conduct of annual physical count of PPE at the end of every year and to submit the corresponding report to the COA Office.

	

Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Audit Team also considered the risks and limitations on the conduct of physical count of PPE due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are no issuances and memorandum from the National Agencies providing the deferment of the said activity. The annual physical count could still be done while observing the health protocols and social distance amid COVID-19 crisis in order to ascertain the existence and completeness of the agency’s properties as well as the accuracy of the reported account balances of PPE. The Audit Team will monitor the actions taken by Management.

	

	

	Unsubmitted Disbursement Vouchers (DVs)



	2.	Management failed to submit the 472 paid disbursement vouchers and their supporting documents for the period covered January 2018 to December 2020 totaling P74,455,595.94 to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed period, contrary to Section 6.05 of COA Circular 95-006, thus rendering doubt on the regularity, validity, propriety and completeness of the agency’s financial transactions and reports.

	

Section 6.05 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 provides:

	

	The official involved in the daily recording of transactions in the books of accounts shall turn over the receipts and the disbursement records with all paid vouchers and documents evidencing the transactions to the Auditor within ten (10) days from the date of receipt of said documents. (Emphasis supplied)

	

		Further, Section 7.01 of the same Circular states:



Unjustified failure on the part of the official or employee concerned to submit the documents and reports mentioned herein shall be considered a ground for the automatic suspension of payment of his salary until he shall have complied with the aforesaid requirements, without prejudice to any disciplinary action that may be instituted against him (Section 122 of P.D. 1445).





Review of the agency’s financial transactions for the period covered CY 2018 to December 31, 2020 revealed that a total of 472 paid disbursement vouchers (DVs) and related supporting documents totaling P74,455,595.94 were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed period. Below is the schedule of unsubmitted disbursement vouchers as at December 31, 2020:

The Management disclosed on their transmittal letters that the lacking DVs will be submitted soonest to the COA Auditor. However, the significant numbers of aforementioned DVs were not yet submitted to the Office of the Auditor despite the commitment of the officials concerned, thus contravened COA Circular 95-006 and Section 4(6) of Presidential Decree No. 1445. 



The Audit Team has inquired verbally the Finance Division relative on the deficiencies and obtained the following reasons from the personnel concerned:

Delayed Submission of Paid Vouchers:



1)	ORs are still being reproduced for the cashier’s copy which usually takes time before forwarding the documents to COA; 



2)	Some supporting documents such as ORs are still being obtained from payees such as suppliers of goods and services specifically those who are paid through Automatic Debit Account (ADA); and



3)	The office is operating at a limited capacity of personnel as a means to mitigate COVID-19 transmission, hence hampering personnel concerned on the processing and collating of documents.



Management’s foregoing explanations on non-submission of the same are not acceptable considering that the transactions amounting to P372,849.33 involving 21 DVs were dated in CY 2018 or two years had already elapsed and this could raise questions as to whether the transactions are regular, valid and appropriate. The conditions obtained merit the issuance of a Notice of Suspension which would mature into a Notice of Disallowance should the 90-day period would elapse and still no submission of the same.



Non-submission of the financial reports and its supporting documents especially paid disbursement vouchers adversely affected the timely evaluation and determination of the regularity, validity, propriety and completeness of financial transactions as well as the audit of agency accounts. It also hindered the Audit Team from communicating possible deficiencies and observations, and suggesting corrective measures that are appropriate and warranted, if any, to the Management.





Recommendations:



As this audit observation has been recurring, we therefore reiterated our recommendations that Management:



	a)		Direct the Finance Division to submit immediately the 472 paid disbursement vouchers and the related supporting documents;  



	b)		Submit a written explanation on the reason/s for failure to comply with the provisions of COA Circular No. 95-006 and why the suspension of salaries of the officials concerned pursuant to Section 7.01 of the same Circular should not be imposed; and

		

	c.	Direct the Officials concerned to strictly observe the timely submission of disbursement vouchers and related supporting documents as prescribed by existing laws, rules and regulations.

	





Management’s Comment:



The Management stated in their letter reply dated February 1, 2021 that out of noted 536 unsubmitted paid DVs as at August 31, 2020 per Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) No. 2020-011-101 (2018-2020) dated September 31, 2020, a total of 339 paid Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) amounting to P20,043,546.74 covering CYs 2018-2020 transactions were partially submitted to the Office of the Auditor. It was further stated 	that delays were encountered during January 2020 and onwards due to the onset of COVID-19 pandemic which has tremendously impacted the operating capacity to scan, photocopy, sort, review and file the CY 2020 DVs. The alternative working arrangement were adopted by the Management and minimum office personnel required in the Office for Finance and Administrative Services (OFAS) because of strict compliance on Health Protocols to  mitigate COVID-19 disease and due to series of actual COVID -19 infections in the MinDA workplace, hence reduced the working capacity of Finance Division for the DVs task. These DVs being accountable and controlled financial documents must be kept and stored in the Office and cannot be brought by employees to their respective house as work from home assignments. 



During the exit conference, the Management also appealed for a humanitarian consideration from the Audit Team because the OFAS are operating at less than 100% working capacity due to the strict health protocol measures and per instruction of the Management to minimize the physical reporting to the Office. Nevertheless, the Chief Administrative Officer for Finance Division committed to submit the remaining DVs and their supporting documents for CYs 2018-2020 transactions to the COA Office by March 2021.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The partial submission of paid DVs for CYs 2018-2020 made by the Finance Division were duly acknowledged and received by the Audit Team as partial compliance with the aforementioned Audit Observation Memorandum. The Audit Team will evaluate and scrutinize the completeness of the supporting documents attached to the DVs. In addition, the Audit Team further reminded the Finance Division for the immediate submission of the DVs of CY 2018 transactions. This has been a recurring audit observation which the Audit Team keeps on reminding the Management to strictly observe the timely submission of disbursement vouchers and related supporting documents as prescribed by existing laws, rules and regulations.





Delayed submission of BRS, Monthly and Quarterly Financial Reports



3.	The Agency did not observe the timely submission of the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS), as well as the Monthly and Quarterly Financial Reports contrary to Chapters 19 and 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I, thus hindering the Auditor from performing timely review of the financial reports and recommending corrective measures if there were deficiencies noted.

	

	

Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of GAM provides:



Sec. 60 Deadlines on Submission of Reports.  All NGAs shall prepare and submit the following financial statements and schedules as follows, with the prescribed deadline:

Further, Sections 5 and 7, Chapter 21, Volume 1 of GAM state:



			Sec. 5. Preparation of the Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS).  The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the Government Servicing Bank (GSB), reconcile the BS with the General Ledger (GL) and prepare the BRS in four copies.

* Deadline for reports falling within ECQ- April 4- May 15, 2020 were moved to May 18, 2020 (1st day of GCQ)



As can be gleaned from the table above, there are significant number days delayed ranging from 1 to 168 days in the submission of the abovementioned financial documents except for the cashier’s report to which delays were infrequent and tolerable.



The Audit Team has inquired verbally from the Finance Division relative to the deficiencies noted and obtained the following reasons from the personnel concerned: 



Delayed Submission of Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) and Financial Statements



1)	Bank statements requested by the management from the bank take too long to reach the office for the preparation of the bank reconciliation statements;



2)	The office is operating at a limited capacity as a means to mitigate COVID- 19 transmission, hence data processing may reach bottleneck;



3)	With the physical transfer of the MinDA official station from the Old Airport Building to The Ritz Hotel, still in Davao City, MinDA servers responsible for running the e-NGAS program were only transferred to the permanent office in the third week of August 2020; and 



4)	The connection of the e-NGAS is dependent on a stable internet connection which is highly dependent on the agency’s service provider and as of the time of inquiry made by the auditor with the Information Technology (IT) Unit, such connections were not yet established despite the follow ups made. This has caused delays in the posting of financial transactions, thus affecting timely submission of the financial reports.



The delayed/non-submission of the Bank Reconciliation Statements, Financial Reports and their supporting schedules adversely affected the timely evaluation and prevented the Audit Team from conducting verification of the said reports in order to establish and ascertain the accuracy and completeness of cash transactions and books of accounts. It also hindered the Audit Team from communicating possible deficiencies and observations and suggesting corrective measures that are appropriate and warranted, if any, to the Management. 







Recommendations:



We therefore recommended that Management:



a)	Direct the Officials concerned to submit the already due financial reports and to strictly observe the timely submission of BRS, Financial Reports with supporting documents as prescribed by existing laws, rules and regulations; and 



b)	Direct the IT Unit of the agency to ensure that a steady stream of internet connection be provided to the personnel concerned that would maximize their access to e-NGAS in order to hasten the recording of transactions and generating the reports of the agency.



Management’s Comment:



Management informed during the exit conference and in its letter reply that the Finance Division already explained the causes of the delay in the submission of financial reports that was brought about by COVID-19 to which the Audit Team considered. They further inform the Audit Team that the Financial Statements and supporting schedules have already been electronically submitted to the Office of the Auditor on February 14, 2021. The BRS for December 2020 is yet to be prepared since the bank has not released its bank statement to the Agency. They also expressed that the preparation and submission of BRS is entirely dependent on the bank to provide prompt bank statement to the requesting Agency and the records would show that the Finance Division is persistent in formally requesting the bank for the issuance of bank statements on a monthly basis. However, the bank is also experiencing work challenges and delays in the delivery of other services to their clients. 



Furthermore, the Management commented that the IT Unit personnel has taken immediate coordination with PLDT and established internet connection to computers on every workstation of MinDA personnel. However, it was noted that the e-NGAS program has no available feature for the system to be accessed remotely by the Finance Division personnel who are working from home. But despite  experiencing work challenges as the office is operating at a limited workforce, the Finance Division was still able to come up with Financial Statements for the year end using the manual version and it was submitted to the COA on due date.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	The Audit Team also made a BRS per Audit but only up to November 2020. Although the delays from Bank on providing copy of Bank Statements of MinDA is beyond the control of the Agency which the Audit Team has also considered; however, the Audit of Cash in Bank accounts of the Agency is also dependent on Bank Statement submitted by the Agency. Nevertheless, the Audit Team duly noted the commitment of the Management to submit the BRS for December 2020 as soon as the bank statements are received from the bank to come up with more reliable balance of Cash in Bank account as at year end. The Trial Balances, Financial Statements and Supporting Schedules for the year ended December 31, 2020 were submitted on February 14, 2021 while the submission of paid DVs is still only up to September 2020 as at February 14, 2021. 

	

	

	Various inconsistencies on Fund Transfers made by the Source to the Implementing Agencies

	

	4.	Non-adherence with the provisions stipulated in the MOA by the Source to the Implementing Agencies has led to various inconsistencies on the Fund Transfers made which casted doubt on the fairness of the presented balance of the Due from LGUs account amounting to P8,740,375.00 as at December 31, 2020; contrary to Item 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 and MinDA Memorandum Order No.  2020-07-50 dated July 17, 2020.

	

Item 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) No. 1 provides: 

	

“Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful presentation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria of the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair presentation.”



	COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 prescribes the Rules and Regulations in the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of Funds Transferred to Implementing Agencies in which salient provisions regarding the Duties and Responsibilities of the Source Agency (SA) is provided under Section 5 of the circular, viz:



5. DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SOURCE AGENCY:



      The SA shall:



5.1 obligate the allotment for the project to be implemented based on the advise of allotment and/or memorandum of agreement or similar document;



5.2 issue a check in the name of the Implementing Agency (IA);



5.3 maintain a subsidiary ledger of the cash transferred pertaining to the project;



5.4 require the Implementing Agency (IA) to submit the reports and furnish the IA with a copy of the journal voucher taking up the expenditures. Upon receipt of the copy of the Certificate of Settlement and Balances (CSB) and the Credit Notice (CN) issued by the IA Auditor, the Accountant shall draw a journal voucher restoring back the amount previously credited for any disallowance.

Review of the fund transfers made by the Agency to various Local Government Units revealed the following deficiencies: 



I. Failure of the MinDA Program Holders/AMO Heads and the Finance Division to perform their task of monitoring as specified under MinDA Memorandum Order No. 2020-07-050 dated July 17, 2020.



The MinDA Chairman introduced a system of monitoring wherein Program Holders/MinDA Chairman thru the issuance of Memorandum Order No. 2020-07-050 dated July 17, 2020, requiring the project holders and/or AMO Personnel to submit a monthly Project Monitoring Report to the Office of the Chairman and the same report will be forwarded to the Finance Division for submission to COA.  This is to strengthen the monitoring process of the agency as indicated in the MOA as summarized and shown in Table No. 1.2.



However, inquiry made with the Management disclosed that only one (1) report was submitted to the Finance Division which was not submitted to COA as of to date. Had project monitoring been performed diligently, the following documents may have been prepared and/or obtained and lapses may have been timely noted and addressed by the Division Heads and/or personnel concerned:



For the Finance Division: 



1)	Demand Letter for the submission of the Report of Disbursement/ Liquidation Report from the Provincial Government of Davao Oriental related to transferred fund amounting to P500,000.00 which was released on December 26, 2019 wherein the MOA states that the Implementing Agency (IA) should submit the technical progress report to MinDA on or before December 31, 2019 to be followed by the liquidation report; 



2)	Duly approved Monthly Project Monitoring Report from the Office of the Chairman for submission to COA within the prescribed period in the MinDA Memo; and



3)	A more reliable financial report.



For the Program Holders/AMO Heads:



4)	An updated Monthly Project Monitoring Report as a result of monitoring the progress of the projects submitted to the Office of the Chairman for appropriate action;



For the Office of the Chairman



5)	Duly received and approved Monthly Project Monitoring Reports to address any problems/issues that may be identified and to direct the division heads for actions needed to be taken immediately. 



	Failure of the MinDA Program Holders/AMO Heads and the Finance Division to perform their task of monitoring these fund transfers has created doubts on MinDA’s capability to properly perform its roles and effectively manage the Agency funds. These may also have effects on the financial reports as there may be liquidations which may not have been reported in a timely manner thus, distorting the balances of the account in the financial statements at a certain period of time.



II. Confirmation Results showed a variance of P30,440.00, thereby overstating the Due from LGUs account.



In order to determine the existence and accuracy of the remaining balance of the Due from LGUs account as at June 30, 2020, the Audit Team sent confirmation letters to Implementing Agencies on October 30, 2020. Out of the three (3) confirmation letters sent, only one (1) agency was able to provide their outstanding balance as presented below:

	The confirmation reply of the Provincial Government of Davao de Oro (See Annex A) contained an explanation that they submitted their Fund Utilization Report to their COA- Implementing Agency on August 7, 2020 and later to MinDA.



	Inquiry made with the Accountant however revealed that they have not received Report of Disbursement/ Fund Utilization Report from any of the Implementing Agencies (IAs), therefore balances remained the same for the abovementioned IAs as at December 31, 2020. 



The failure of the Management to require the Implementing Agency (IA) to submit the reports and to furnish the IA with a copy of the journal entry voucher taking up the expenditures has resulted in a variance of P30,440.00 which remained unadjusted in the books of accounts of the Agency and thereby has casted doubt on the fairness of the Due from LGUs account.



III. Non-submission of Disbursement Vouchers



Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) of the fund transfers released as at December 31, 2020 which are summarized below remained unsubmitted despite of the issuance of AOM No. 2020-011-101 dated September 30, 2020, demanding the submission of the same.

Inquiry made with the Finance Division revealed that the Implementing Agencies (IAs) were still not able to issue Official Receipts (ORs) of the funds transferred which hampered the timely submission of these paid vouchers.



The Audit Team reiterates that the non-submission of the Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) mentioned has precluded the timely evaluation as to the regularity, validity and propriety of the transactions thereby hindering the Audit Team from communicating possible deficiencies and observations and suggesting corrective measures that are appropriate and warranted, if any, to the Management.



		The foregoing observations contravened COA Circular No. 94-013, Item 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) No. 1 and demonstrated non-adherence to stipulations on contracts entered into by and between Mindanao Development Authority (MinDA) and the Local Government Units (LGUs) concerned. 







Recommendations:



We therefore recommended that Management as the Source Agency (SA) to direct:



The Finance Division-



	a)	To demand for the Liquidation Reports from the Provincial Government of Davao Oriental for the procurement of ten (10) “pakura” or a small motorized boat using handline fishing gear as this should have been liquidated as at December 31, 2019 as indicated in the MOA. Submit a copy of the duly-received demand letter to COA as reference; 



	b)	To demand from the Implementing Agencies the submission of the Official Receipts (ORs), as proof of receipt of the funds transferred, in order for the Disbursement Vouchers to be submitted to the Office of the Audit Team Leader for post audit;



	c)	To monitor and coordinate with the Office of the Chairman on the submission of the Monthly Project Monitoring Reports from the Program Holders/AMO Heads that would guide the office of its next steps such as sending of reminders/demand letters in case the project has been completed or ask for justifications in case of incurrence of delays, inaction or any similar circumstances;



	d)	To require the Accountant to promptly record transactions and adjustments provided that documentary requirements are complete and proper as to present a more reliable balance of the account at a given period; 



The Program Holders/ AMO Heads-



	e)	To strictly submit the  Monthly Project Monitoring Reports as required by the Office of the Chairman as an embodiment of MinDA’s commitment to monitor the progress of the projects as stipulated in the MOA;



	f)	Communicate and secure from the IAs concerned the needed reports/documents stipulated in the MOA.  We encourage that all communications be made in writing for proper documentation;



	g)	In the event that the implementing agency still does not act on the matter, cause the office to issue a demand letter through existing channels of communication;



All of MinDA



	h)	To faithfully perform their duties and responsibilities to conform with the agreement conditions as well as to comply with the provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013 and other related issuances so as not to be faulted with negligence.





Management’s Comment:



Management informed during the exit conference and in its letter reply that an official letter was sent to the Provincial Government of Davao Oriental on January 18, 2021 demanding the submission of a Liquidation Report (LR) for P500,000.00 fund transferred as duly verified by the Resident Auditor. The said letter was duly acknowledged by the Local Government Unit (LGU) concerned but the full amount remained outstanding due to non-receipt of the original copy of the LR from the LGU. 



The Management further commented that the paid DVs for the fund transfer made by the MinDA to the LGUs were not yet submitted to COA Office because the Finance Division is still awaiting for the Official Receipts (ORs) from recipient LGUs. Official follow-up letters will be sent to the recipient LGUs who have not yet issued ORs to acknowledge receipt of the funds transferred by MinDA. While the Project Monitoring Reports as required by the Office of the Chairperson from the Program Holders and AMO Heads were appended to the letter reply and submitted to the COA Office.  



Furthermore, the Head of the Agency communicated the directive order to the MinDA Officials concerned to continue the coordination and follow-up the progress of the projects with the LGUs concerned as well as the monitoring of submission of Monthly Progress Report. The MinDA Chairperson expressed also during the exit conference and addressed this concern that before engaging or the financial assistance be turned over to the Implementing Agencies (IA), a confirmation from the IA that they are capable of utilizing the fund and implementing the projects right away must be sought. Protocols must be followed to abide with the COA rules and regulations on fund transfer. 



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



Validation of the Report on Status of Unliquidated Fund Transfers revealed that the total Due from LGUs account as at December 31, 2020 amounted to P8,740,375.00. However, variance between the balance per confirmation letter and the recorded receivable based on the books amounting to P30,440.00 was not yet included in the adjusting entries of the Accountant as the Finance Division has not received the original copies of the Report of Disbursements presenting the actual expenditures associated with the project implementation. One of the duties and responsibilities of the Source Agency is to require the Implementing Agency (IA) to submit reports and issue Official receipt, and furnish the IA with a copy of the journal voucher taking up the expenditures as provided under COA Circular No. 94-013. All necessary documents and other relevant reports for the fund transfer for the Audit Team to review, check and verify must be submitted to the COA Office and to ascertain the reliability and fairness of the balance presented on the Due from LGUs account.



Moreover, the Audit Team duly noted the appropriate actions need to be done by Management and all personnel concerned, as well as monitor the actions taken by Finance Division, Program Holders and AMO Heads.



Payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay without supporting documents



5.	The payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay to MinDA’s workforce totaling  P91,500.00 for the period covered March 17, 2020 to April 14, 2020 were not supported with duly approved Office Orders authorizing the physical reporting of personnel during the period of an Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) as well as their approved Daily Time Records (DTRs) contrary to DBM Circular 2020-1 and COA Circular 2012-001 respectively, hence casting doubt as to whether these personnel concerned are legally entitled to receive such benefit.

	

The grant of COVID-19 Hazard Pay was authorized under Section 1.1 of DBM Circular 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020, to wit:



	1)	Administrative Order (AO) No. 261 dated March 23, 2020 authorizes the grant of Hazard Pay, to be called as COVID-19 Hazard Pay, to government employees and workers engaged though contract of service (COS) or job order (JO) basis who physically report for work during the implementation of an Enhanced Community Quarantine in their respective work stations, in an amount not exceeding P500/day per person.



Said benefit shall be granted to the aforementioned government employees and workers since they are inevitable exposed to health risks and hazards if they physically report for work during the period of an Enhanced Community Quarantine.



1Authorizing the Grant of Hazard Pay to Government Personnel Who Physically Report for Work During the Period of Implementation of an Enhanced Community Quarantine Relative to the COVID-19 Outbreak.



In relation thereto, Section 4.0 of the same circular provides that the Head of Government Agencies may grant COVID-19 Hazard Pay to their personnel/workers without the need for further approval by the DBM, subject to the following conditions:



4.1 The COVID-19 Hazard Pay to be granted shall not exceed P500 /day per person, which shall be computed as follows:

COVID-19 Hazard Pay

=

P500

X

No. of Days Physically Reporting for Work During the Quarantine Period





 









4.2 The personnel are occupying regular, contractual or casual positions, or are workers engaged through COS, JO, or other similar schemes.



4.3 The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work at their respective officers or work stations on the prescribed official working hours by the head of agency/office during the period of implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine measures in the area of such office or work station. (Emphasis supplied)



In addition, COA Circular 2012-001 also provides for the documentary requirements with regards to the grant of hazard pay which are as follows:



1)	Xxx

2)	Duly accomplished time record of employees or travel report

3)	Copy of special order  from the agency/department head covering the assignment to hazardous or difficult areas 

4)	Approved DTR/Service Report



The MinDA Chairperson has issued an office memorandum with regard to the creation of a skeletal team [workforce] who will be tasked to man the office and ensure continued delivery of services to its clients and stakeholders. 



An excerpt from the Memorandum No. 2020-03-030 dated March 13, 2020 reads as follows: 



1. Following the directives issued by President Rodrigo R. Duterte on addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, I am ordering a suspension of work effective immediately. Xx



1)	We will adapt a work-at-home arrangement to be able to ensure continued delivery of public commitments and ensure the delivery of government services. Xx



2)	A skeletal team shall be organized to man the MinDA offices (Davao, Manila and Area Management Offices (AMOs) to immediately address queries and concerns of our partners and clients and ensure that government services would not be disrupted. Xx” (Emphasis supplied. List of the skeletal teams were appended to this memo.)



Further, the Chairperson issued Memorandum Order No. 2020-03-032 dated March 27, 2020 to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by ordering the following, “physical closure of the MinDA Davao Main Office and its AMOs beginning March 30, 2020 until further modified or extended. Hence, the rotational skeletal force reporting scheme is hereby suspended. A work from home arrangement shall be fully implemented by this office. Xxx 



The Office of the Finance and Administrative Services shall adopt a suitable arrangement to still continue to facilitate the processing of financial and administrative transactions.” (Emphasis supplied)



	Upon scrutiny of the said guidelines, the following conditions are needed to be met by the employees/COS and JOs of MinDA to be entitled with such benefit:



1)	Authority to physically report for work at their respective officers or work stations on the prescribed official working hours by the head of agency/office during the period of implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine measures in the area of such office or work station but only up to March 29, 2020 per Memorandum Order No. 2020-03-032 dated March 27, 2020 ordering the “ physical closure of the MinDA Davao Main Office and its AMOs beginning March 30, 2020 until further modified or extended; and 



2)	Submission of approved DTRs as proof of physical reporting to the office.



In line with the above guidelines, MinDA has paid the COVID-19 hazard pay to its workforce amounting to P91,500.00 for having rendered physical reporting during ECQ specifically the period of March 17 to April 14, 2020 which were covered by the following references:

d)	The abovementioned claims were also not supported with approved DTRs; hence the audit team is also unable to ascertain the correctness of the financial transactions.



It can be gleaned from the abovementioned conditions that Management contravened the cited provisions on the grant of COVID 19 hazard pay which has casted doubt on the entitlement of the MinDA personnel concerned. Furthermore, the transactions may be suspended or disallowed in audit if the Management will not rectify the aforementioned deficiencies in the payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay. 



Recommendations:



Hence, we recommended the following actions to the Head of the Agency to require or direct the division/personnel concerned of the following:



Accountant/Finance Division-



a)	The accountant to render a written explanation on why the payments of COVID-19 Hazard Pay were processed despite the following:



1)	Lacking Office Orders of some claimants and Supplemental Office Orders, if any,  for those who did not strictly follow their work schedules; 



2)	Suspension of rotational skeletal work scheme starting March 30, 2020 onwards; and 



3)	Non submission of the approved DTRs for the months March and April 2020;



b)	The Finance Division to check whether all subsequent claims of COVID-19 Hazard Pay are covered by an approved Office Order to support the legality and entitlement of the said benefit; and



c)	Henceforth, require the Finance Division to strictly follow the provisions of DBM Circular 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020 and COA Circular 2012-001 when paying COVID-19 Hazard Pay to qualified employees in order to avoid incurrence of “illegal”, “excessive” or “unsupported” expenditures which could result in audit disallowances or suspensions.



HR/ Administrative Division-



d)	Require the Head of the Human Resources Section to immediately submit additional office orders, supplemental/memorandum orders which served as the basis for the grant of COVID 19 hazard pay which may not have been made available to the audit team for consideration or a written justification for the lack thereof; and



e)	Submit Approved DTRs for the months March and April 2020 of the claimants.

Management’s Comment:

	

During the exit conference, the Management informed that they have justification/ explanation letter on the underlying circumstances on the grant of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay despite the lack of supporting documents. Subsequently, they submitted the approved Supplemental Office Orders to the Office of the Auditor on February 1, 2021 which covers the personnel who were actually present/voluntarily reported to the Office despite the threat of COVID-19 during the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) period. They also expressed their commitment to submit the duly approved DTRs of the personnel concerned through the Human Resource/Administrative Division in March 2021.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



Based on the validation of submitted documents, the Management was able to submit a written authority for those personnel (Plantilla and Contract of Service) who were on duty during the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) which were also paid with Hazard Pay. However, the related approved DTRs were still not submitted by the HRMDU to COA. 



Moreover, the Audit Team duly noted the appropriate actions need to be done by Management as well as monitor the submission of the DTRs of the personnel concerned to ascertain the propriety on the financial transactions relative to the payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay.





Non-compliance with RA 9184 on procurement of Highly Technical Consultant

		

1)		Procurement of Highly Technical Consultants was not in consonance with pertinent provisions of the RIRR of RA 9184 as evidenced by inconsistencies and lapses in the procurement process, thus determining the validity, legality and propriety of the disbursements totaling P5,531,710.20  made by the Agency for Consultancy Services could not be ascertained.



Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulation (RIRR) of Republic Act (RA) 9184 provide:



7.1 All procurement shall be within the approved budget of the Procuring Entity and should be meticulously and judiciously planned by the Procuring Entity. Consistent with government fiscal discipline measures, only those considered crucial to the efficient discharge of governmental functions shall be included in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP). For purposes of this IRR, a procurement project shall be considered crucial to the efficient discharge of governmental functions if it is required for the day-to-day operations or is in pursuit of the principal mandate of the Procuring Entity concerned. The APP shall include provisions for foreseeable emergencies based on historical records. - x x x-



      7.2 No procurement shall be undertaken unless it is in accordance with the approved APP, including approved changes thereto. The APP must be consistent with the duly approved yearly budget of the Procuring Entity and shall bear the approval of the HoPE or second-ranking official designated by the HoPE to act on his behalf.

	

Item 7(b), Section V(D) of ANNEX “H” of the RIRR of the same Republic Act provides the procedures on Negotiated Procurement for Highly Technical Consultants which states that:



         b) Procedure



i)	The End-User Unit shall justify to the BAC the engagement of the individual in accordance with the conditions set forth in this Section.



ii)	The BAC shall undertake the negotiation with the individual consultant based on the Terms of Reference prepared by the End-User. Considering the nature of the consultancy work, the negotiations need not be elaborate, it is enough that the BAC has validated that the individual is legally, technically and financially capable to undertake and fulfill the consultancy work based on the Terms of Reference.



iii)	The BAC shall recommend to the HOPE the award of contract to the individual consultant. Award of contract shall be made in accordance with Section (IV)(L) of this Guidelines.



During the CY 2020, the Agency hired twelve (12) Highly Technical Consultants (HTCs) through Negotiated Procurement, where trust and confidence are the primary consideration for the hiring. Out of the twelve (12) individual consultants, three (3) individual consultants were newly engaged and nine (9) individual consultants were subsequently renewed their contract upon expiration of their terms from prior year, viz:

Validation of the procurement activities made by the Agency revealed the following deficiencies:



A.  Failure of the end-user unit/ Office Responsible to prepare a justification to the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) for the engagement of Highly Technical Consultant through Negotiated Procurement.



 	Inquiry made with the BAC Secretariat revealed that no justification from the end-user unit/ Office Responsible was submitted to the BAC based on their records. However, the BAC of the Agency made recommendations to the Head of the Procuring Entity (HOPE) to award of contract to the individual consultant without considering the preliminary procedure of the Negotiated Procurement for Highly Technical Consultants as provided in the RIRR of RA 9184.

The failure of end-user units to justify to the BAC the engagement of the individual consultant has resulted in the inadequate procurement activities of the BAC which is contrary to procedures of the Negotiated Procurement for Highly Technical Consultants provided under Annex H of the RIRR of RA 9184.



B. Inconsistencies in the Terms of Reference for the procurement of Highly Technical Consultants in CY 2019 with the approved APP for CYs 2019-2020 



However, review of the approved APP for CYs 2019-2020 and the Terms of References (TOR) attached to the Contract per renewed and newly Individual Consultant revealed that there were inconsistencies on the specific description of the TORs of the Highly Technical Consultants as subsequently renewed their contract upon expiration of their terms from prior year to the Procurement Project of MinDA’s APP for CYs 2019-2020 (See Annex B for the images of Page 1 of APP 2019 and Page 29 of APP CY 2020). 



As a general rule, all procurement shall be within the approved budget of the Procuring Entity and in accordance with the approved APP, including approved changes thereto. However, the foregoing condition shows that inconsistencies in the Terms of Reference to procurement project under the APP contravened Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of the RIRR of RA 9184.	



Recommendations:



We therefore recommended henceforth that Management require/direct:



	a)	The End-user units/Responsible Office Head to submit their justifications to the BAC the engagement of the individual consultant in accordance with the procedures of Negotiated Procurement for Highly Technical Consultants provided under Annex H of the RIRR of RA 9184; and



	b)	The Bids and Award Committee (BAC) to strictly observe the pertinent provisions of the RIRR of RA 9184 and to ensure that all procurement shall be within the approved APP of MinDA.



Management’s Comment:



	During the exit conference, the Management commented that the justification of the end-user unit is already embedded in the Term of Reference of individual consultant. However, they further commented that a written justification was already complied to conform with the procedures on procurement of Highly Technical Consultant provided under Annex H of RIRR of the RA 9184. 



Moreover, the Management commented that the Annual Procurement Plan for CY 2019 particularly on the lumped sum amount of Approved Budget for Contract (ABC) for the procurement of Highly Technical Consultant were not yet specified/ provided with itemized Highly Technical Consultant (HTC) because the MinDA Chairperson has just assumed office during that time. Hence, the projects and programs that are needed for Highly Technical Consultant were not yet identified. Eventually, the MinDA Chairperson has gradually determined the need of consultancy upon meeting with various sector Heads.  



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	The Audit Team emphasized that one of the functions of the BAC Secretariat provided under the RIRR of RA 9184 is to take custody of procurement documents and other records and ensure that all procurements undertaken by the Procuring Entity are properly documented. Hence, the said justification from the end-user unit on engagement of the individual consultant must be expressed in writing, addressed to the BAC. There must be an acknowledgement receipt from the BAC on the justification letter from end-user unit. It was further provided under RIRR of RA 9184 that the BAC Secretariat shall monitor the procurement activities and milestones for proper reporting to relevant agencies when required. Thus, a separate justification letter from the end-user unit as appended to the prepared Terms of Reference must be provided to the COA Auditor whenever validation is undertaken by the Audit Team on the Agency’s procurement process.

	

	Non-compliance with GAD rules and regulations



	7.	Out of the P8,331,016.60 minimum GAD Budget or 5% of the total approved budget from the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of the agency for CY 2019, only P2,665,047.00 or 1.6% was attributed by the Agency as GAD Programs/ Projects/Activities per GAD Accomplishment Report, thus defeating the intent of the agency to pursue women empowerment and gender equality, contrary to the pertinent provisions of RA 9710.

	

Section 36 of RA 9710 partly states that:

Section 36. Gender Mainstreaming as a Strategy for Implementing the Magna Carta of Women. - 

All departments, including their attached agencies, offices, bureaus, state universities and colleges, government-owned and -controlled corporations, local government units, and other government instrumentalities shall adopt gender mainstreaming as a strategy to promote women's human rights and eliminate gender discrimination in their systems, structures, policies, programs, processes, and procedures which shall include, but not limited to, the following:

(a) Planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation for GAD. GAD programs addressing gender issues and concerns shall be designed and implemented based on the mandate of government agencies and local government units, Republic Act No. 7192, gender equality agenda of the government and other GAD-related legislation, policies, and commitments. The development of GAD programs shall proceed from the conduct of a gender audit of the agency or the local government unit and a gender analysis of its policies, programs, services and the situation of its clientele; the generation and review of sex-disaggregated data; and consultation with gender/women's rights advocates and agency/women clientele. The cost of implementing GAD programs shall be the agency's or the local government unit's GAD budget which shall be at least five percent (5%) of the agency's or the local government unit's total budget appropriations.  xxx

The Commission on Audit (COA) shall conduct an annual audit on the use of the GAD budget for the purpose of determining its judicious use and the efficiency, and effectiveness of interventions in addressing gender issues towards the realization of the objectives of the country's commitments, plans, and policies on women empowerment, gender equality, and GAD. xxx

To move towards a more sustainable, gender-responsive, and performance-based planning and budgeting, gender issues and concerns shall be integrated in, among others, the following plans: xxx

 (2) Annual plans of all departments, including their attached agencies, offices, bureaus, state universities and colleges, and government-owned and -controlled corporations; and xxx

(b) Creation and/or Strengthening of the GAD Focal Points (GFP). All departments, including their attached agencies, offices, bureaus, state universities and colleges, government- owned and -controlled corporations, local government units, and other government instrumentalities shall establish or strengthen their GAD Focal Point System or similar GAD mechanism to catalyze and accelerate gender mainstreaming within the agency or local government unit.

The GAD Focal Point System shall be composed of the agency head or local chief executive, an executive committee with an Undersecretary (or its equivalent), local government unit official, or office in a strategic decision-making position as Chair; and a technical working group or secretariat which is composed of representatives from various divisions or offices within the agency or local government unit.

The tasks and functions of the members of the GFP shall form part of their regular key result areas and shall be given due consideration in their performance evaluation.

(c) Generation and Maintenance of GAD Database. All departments, including their attached agencies, offices, bureaus, state universities and colleges, government-owned and - controlled corporations, local government units, and other government instrumentalities shall develop and maintain a GAD database containing gender statistics and sex disaggregated data that have been systematically gathered, regularly updated; and subjected to; gender analysis for planning, programming, and policy formulation. (underscoring supplied) 

	Review of the submitted Gender and Development (GAD) Accomplishment Report for CY 2019 revealed that the agency has set a GAD Budget of P25,714,583.00 or 15% of the CY 2019 Appropriations, which was planned to cover the different GAD Activities identified by the Management in order to address GAD issues.



 However, upon evaluation of the GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) of the PPAs implemented, the GFPS was only able to attribute P2,665,047.00 to GAD, thus, leaving a balance of unattributed budget amounting to P23,049,536.00, to wit:

As can be gleaned from the above table, the agency was not able to attribute budgeted funds as mentioned above due to the following reasons:

2)	Some GAD Activities has already covered various GAD outputs/outcomes, thus the intended budget for the planned activities were no longer utilized and has been identified to have amounted to P365,587.00;





3)	The Agency was not able to maximize the utilization of project funds attributed to GAD in their performance of the Project, Plans and Activities to address GAD issues and promote gender sensitivity. It is a manifestation that there is a large difference between the budgeted GAD Client- focused activities versus the actual disbursements wherein out of the budgeted amount of P22,812,635.00, only P2,043,993.00 was actually attributed to GAD; and





4)	The GAD Organization- Focused activities were mainly focused to improve the limited capacity of the GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) in mainstreaming GAD initiatives which suggests that the agency is still building its competency to properly conduct the different activities associated with GAD.



While it is commendable that the Agency has planned to attribute at least 5% of its appropriations to GAD when the law only requires at least 5% of the total Agency budget, monitoring of the accomplishments through attribution has however revealed that it has fallen short of the minimum requirement, to wit: 



GAA CY 2019 Approved Budget

Minimum required GAD Budget (at least 5% of the total agency budget)

Actual GAD attribution for the year

1.6%

166,620,332.00

   8,331,016.60 

     2,665,047.00 





Inquiry with the Chairperson of the Technical Working Group (TWG) of the MinDA GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) has revealed the following:



1)	The Agency at that time is still strengthening its capacity to conduct the different duties and responsibilities of the GFPS through attendance to workshops and seminars;



2)	That upon the evaluation of the projects undertaken, supporting documents such as concept papers, activity designs, accomplishment reports and attendance sheets among others, lack the necessary data to determine the gender responsiveness of the PPAs; and



3)	That during the planning phase of the agency PPAs, gender sensitivity of which were not discussed.





It should be noted by the Agency that in order to properly identify and address gender issues, the Management must emphasize the importance of gender mainstreaming as a strategy to design, implement, monitor and evaluate policies, programs and projects in all social, political, civil and economic spheres so that women and men benefit equally. The processes conducted in the gender mainstreaming aims to develop GAD programs based on the Agency mandate which could address gender issues and promote women empowerment.





GFPS evaluation of GAD PAPs also plays a huge role in identifying problems, bottlenecks and hindrances while using the prescribed tools such as the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) Project Implementation and Management, and Monitoring and Evaluation (PIMME) checklist in assessing the gender-responsiveness of the implementation of the program/project, so as to come up with strategies identified to be ideal and efficient for all parties.





			The abovementioned condition contravened Section 36 RA 9710 or Magna Carta of Women, thus defeating the intent of the agency to pursue women empowerment and gender equality.

	

	

	

	Recommendations:

	

We therefore recommended that Management:



a)	Maximize the utilization of the GAD Funds and require the Heads of Implementing Divisions/Offices to ensure the implementation of GAD–related programs and projects in order to attain the objective for which funds were provided; 

		

b)	Direct the GFPS Committee and members of the TWG to ascertain compliance with Section 36 of RA 9710; and



c)	Provide assistance to the MinDA GFPS so they may able to effectively conduct the crucial tasks associated with GAD.



Management’s Comment:



	During the exit conference, the Management duly noted the audit recommendations and commented that the MinDA GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) will strictly observe the RA 9710 to be able to address the Gender Issues in the Office.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



	The Audit Team duly noted the actions needed to be taken by the Management and shall monitor the Agency’s full compliance with pertinent rules and regulations and that the GAD Focal Point System will be responsive about their responsibilities to address the Gender Issues in the Agency as well as implement the GAD PPAs attributed to at least 5% of the total budget of the Agency.

Audit of Cash- MDS Regular:



Audit of Cancelled Modified Disbursement System (MDS) checks and stale checks



	The Audit Team issued Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) No. 2020-013-101 dated December 21, 2020 relative to Cancelled Modified Disbursement System (MDS) checks and stale checks amounting to P733,407.62 and P37,173.40, respectively, which remained unadjusted in the books of accounts of the Agency as at August 31, 2020 contrary to Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) No. 1 and pertinent provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, thus resulting in the understatement of the Cash- MDS, Regular account.



We therefore recommended the Head of the Agency to require/direct the personnel concerned of the following actions:



a)	The Accountant to recognize stale checks and promptly record the MDS check cancellations and the corresponding decrease or increase of the related accounts in the books of accounts of agency; 



b)	The Cashier to restore the stale/voided/spoiled checks to the  Checks and ADA Disbursements Record (CkADADRec) to reflect the correct balance of the cash account; and



c)	The Accountant and the Cashier to observe the prescribed guidelines in the cancellation of MDS checks to ensure that Cash-MDS, Regular account and its related accounts are reported fairly in the books of accounts of the agency as prescribed by Section 27 of PPSAS No. 1 and pertinent provision of the Government Accounting Manual.



		Based on submitted documents by the Management, the Accountant was able to adjust a total amount of P911,616.94 cancelled/stale checks up to December 31, 2020 (See Annex C). All cancelled and stale checks in the AOM were adjusted. The cashier however, was not able to add back the following cancelled/ stale checks amounting to P135,050.52 in the CheckADARec, to wit:
