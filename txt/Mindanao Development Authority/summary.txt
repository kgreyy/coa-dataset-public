EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A.    	Introduction



By virtue of Republic Act No. 9996 known as the “Mindanao Development Authority Act of 2010” dated February 17, 2010, Mindanao Development Authority (MinDA) was created. The former Mindanao Economic Development Council (MEDCo) created under Executive Order No. 512 (s. 1992) and as amended by the issuance of Executive Order No. 244 (s. 2000), Executive Order No. 354 (s. 2004), Executive Order No. 357 (s. 2004) and Executive Order No. 757 (s. 2008) was abolished.  



Its mandate is to promote, coordinate and facilitate the active and extensive participation of all sectors to effect the socioeconomic development in Mindanao through a holistic and integrated approach and to promote and strengthen interregional linkages to ensure the increased viability of Mindanao-wide and/or Mindanao- specific programs and projects.



It also acts as the Philippine Coordinating Office (PCOBE) for the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA), ensuring the active participation of Mindanao and Palawan in the sub-regional economic cooperation.



		MinDA also heads the Mindanao Power Monitoring Committee (MPMC) created through Executive Order No. 81 dated July 30, 2012, as well as serves as the Secretariat of the MPMC that provides the necessary administrative support. It shall also serve as the repository of all documents and records of the MPMC.



	B.   	Audit Methodology



	The Commission has been implementing the risk-based audit in the conduct of its audit services. However, to meet the evolving development in public governance and fund management, the results-based approach in audit was incorporated. The integration of these two approaches, called the Integrated Results and Risk-Based Audit (IRRBA) Methodology was applied in the audit of the accounts and operations of the Agency.



	C.  	Scope of Audit



The audit covered the review of accounts and operations of MinDA, Davao City for CY 2020. The audit consisted of review of operating procedures, evaluation of the Agency’s programs and projects, interview of concerned government officials and employees, verification, reconciliation, analysis of accounts and such other procedures considered necessary.

E.        Independent Auditor’s Report

	

		The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements of the Agency as at December 31, 2020 because (1) the existence, completeness and accuracy of the reported year-end balances of the PPE accounts totaling P18,245,842.86 could not be ascertained due to non-submission of the Report on Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) and non-conduct of the physical count of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE); and (2) Various inconsistencies due to non-adherence with the provisions stipulated in the MOA were noted in the audit of Fund Transfers made by the Source to the Implementing Agencies which casted doubt on the fairness of the presented balance of the Due from LGUs account amounting to P8,740,375.00 as at December 31, 2020. 

	

	F.	Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations  



	The following are the audit observations and corresponding recommendations, which were discussed with management officials concerned during an exit conference on February 22, 2021, details of which were discussed in Part II of this Report.  Management’s views and comments were incorporated in the report where appropriate.

	

1)		Non-submission of the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) contravened Section 38, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), thus determining the PPE’s existence, serviceable conditions and accuracy of the balance of P18,245,842.86 as at December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained.

	

We therefore recommended that management:



	a)		Direct Inventory Committee to prepare the RPCPPE as prescribed in Appendix 73, Volume II of the GAM and to submit the same to the COA Office;  

 

	b)		Inform and/or invite a representative of the COA through a request letter to serve as witness in the conduct of annual physical count of PPE; and

		

	c.	Strictly observe the time frame for the conduct of annual physical count of PPE at the end of every year and the corresponding RPCPPE is submitted to the Auditor not later than January 31 of the following year.

	

2)		Management failed to submit the 472 paid disbursement vouchers and their supporting documents for the period covered January 2018 to December 2020 totaling P74,455,595.94 to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed period, contrary to Section 6.05 of COA Circular 95-006, thus rendering doubt on the regularity, validity, propriety and completeness of the agency’s financial transactions and reports.

		

We therefore recommended that Management:



	a)	Direct the Finance Division to submit immediately the 472 paid disbursement vouchers and related supporting documents to the Office of the Auditor;



	b)	Submit a written explanation on the reason/s for failure to comply with the provisions of COA Circular No. 95-006 and why the suspension of salaries of the Officials concerned pursuant to Section 7.01 of the same Circular should not be imposed; and



	c)	Direct the Officials concerned to strictly observe the timely submission of disbursement vouchers and related supporting documents as prescribed by existing laws, rules and regulations.



3)	Non-adherence with the provisions stipulated in the MOA by the Source to the Implementing Agencies has led to various inconsistencies on the Fund Transfers made which casted doubt on the fairness of the presented balance of the Due from LGUs account amounting to P8,740,375.00 as at December 31, 2020; contrary to Item 27 of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS), COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 and MinDA Memorandum Order No.  2020-07-50 dated July 17, 2020.

	

We therefore recommended that Management direct:



The Finance Division-



a)	To demand for the Liquidation Reports from the Provincial Government of Davao Oriental for the procurement of ten (10) “pakura” or a small motorized boat using handline fishing gear as this should to have been liquidated as at December 31, 2019 as indicated in the MOA. Submit a copy of the duly-received demand letter to COA as reference;



b)	To demand from the Implementing Agencies the submission of the Official Receipts (ORs), as proof of receipt of the funds transferred, in order for the Disbursement Vouchers to be submitted to the Office of the Audit Team Leader for post audit; 



c)	To monitor and coordinate with the Office of the Chairman on the submission of the Monthly Project Monitoring Reports from the Program Holders/AMO Heads that would guide the office of its next steps such as sending of reminders/demand letters in case the project has been completed or ask for justifications in case of incurrence of delays, inaction or any similar circumstances;



d)	To require the Accountant to promptly record transactions and adjustments provided that documentary requirements are complete and proper as to present a more reliable balance of the account at a given period



The Program Holders/ AMO Heads-



e)	To strictly submit the  Monthly Project Monitoring Reports as required by the Office of the Chairman as an embodiment of MinDA’s commitment to monitor the progress of the projects as stipulated in the MOA;



f)	Communicate and secure from the IAs concerned the needed reports/documents stipulated in the MOA.  We encourage that all communications be made in writing for proper documentation;



g)	In the event that the implementing agency still does not act on the matter, cause the office to issue a demand letter through existing channels of communication; 



All of MinDA



h)	To faithfully perform their duties and responsibilities to conform to the agreement conditions as well as to comply with the provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013 and other related issuances so as not to be faulted with negligence.
