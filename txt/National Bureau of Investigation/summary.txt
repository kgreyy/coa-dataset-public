D)	independent Auditor’s Report



The auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of NBI as of December 31, 2020. 





E)	Summary of Observations and Recommendations

		

1)	The Cash-Collecting Officers account with a balance of ₱3,587,397.90 as of December 31, 2020 cannot be relied upon due to: a) presence of negative balance amounting to ₱1,097,575.44 and “Reclass” balance in the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) amounting to ₱13,751.70 which is not in pursuance to Section 4 (8) of PD 1445; and b) unrecorded deposit in the amount of ₱21,840.00.   Also, prior years’ collections amounting to ₱3,235,580.30 remained unremitted in violation of Section 32 of the Revised Cash Examination Manual (RCEM).  (Observation No. 1)



           We reiterated our recommendations that management require the Acting Chief Accountant to: a) speed up the analysis and identification of the accounts with the view of eliminating negative and “Reclass” account balances; b) direct the Collecting Officers/Special Collecting Officers to immediately deposit their unremitted collections, issue demand letters and a memorandum relative thereto; c) withhold the salary of accountable  officers corresponding to the unremitted collections, if warranted; and d)  prepare necessary journal entry for the unrecorded deposit in the amount of ₱21,840.00.



2)	The Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) account balance of ₱76,182,091.42 as of December 31, 2020 is misstated due to the unrecorded deliveries from Procurement Service-Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) and National Printing Office (NPO) amounting to ₱1,142,101.84 and ₱684,000.00, respectively, thus, adversely affecting the fair presentation of the  accounts in the financial statements. (Observation No. 2)



We recommended that Management: a) require the Accounting Division to prepare necessary adjusting entries on the deliveries made and coordinate with PS-DBM to reconcile balances; b) direct the Supply and Property Section  to coordinate with the end-users and submit to the Accounting Division the Inspection and Acceptance Report for  delivered items and Report of Supplies and Materials Issued   for issuances; and c) require the Forensic Chemistry Division to submit to Supply Property Section all  documents including the Delivery Receipts relating to deliveries made.



3)	The balance of Advances to Special Disbursing Officers account amounting to ₱32,802,541.03 as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to the presence of “reclass” balance amounting to ₱3,503,141.03 and inclusion of cash advances for petty operating expenses  amounting to  ₱828,000.00; thereby affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements. (Observation No. 3)



We recommended that Management: a) require the Accounting Division  to draw a JEV to properly classify the amount of ₱828,000.00; b) conduct reconciliation of the “reclass” balances of Advances to Special Disbursing Officer and Petty Cash accounts amounting to ₱3,503,141.03 and ₱270,369.11, respectively; c) review the operating needs of the Office/Division and adjust the amount of Petty Cash Fund to be granted, if needed; and d) strictly comply with the pertinent provisions  in the GAM.



4)	The balance of Property Plant and Equipment accounts aggregating ₱1,683,370,827.32 as of December 31, 2020 cannot be ascertained due to: a) unreconciled difference of ₱518,741,340.36 between the balance per books and the balance per Report of Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE); and b) the presence of “reclass” balances in various PPE accounts totaling ₱221,696,056.00 which adversely affected the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements. (Observation No. 4)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Division and the Supply and Property Section/Stockroom Unit to exert extra efforts in their on-going reconciliation of records to verify discrepancies in compliance with the provisions of the GAM and take up the necessary adjustments in the books, if any.



5)	The erroneous credit of Due from Officers and Employees account amounting to ₱926,506.35 instead of Due to Officers and Employees account in the payment of salaries and wages of project workers and casual employees resulted in the understatement of both accounts by ₱926,506.35 contrary to Section 2.c Chapter 3 of the GAM Volume III. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended that Management: a) require the Chief Accountant to prepare necessary adjusting entries to correct erroneous recording and reflect the correct balances of the accounts Due to Officers and Employees and Due from Officers and Employees; and b) use the proper accounts in recording transactions of the Agency.



6)	The Due to NGAs account with a book balance of ₱33,723,239.43 as at year-end is unreliable due to: a) presence of negative balance amounting to ₱482,520.00; and b) temporary account balance of ₱12,097,892.52. (Observation No. 6)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Division to: a)  exert more efforts in the conduct of reconciliation of accounts by working back on the accounting entries made; and b) prepare necessary adjustments with proper explanation and supporting documents, if any, and submit the same to the Audit Team.



7)	Out of the ₱103,705,779.00 fund transferred to Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) for the purchase of a state-of-the-art equipment vital to the Clearance Processing System (CPS) of NBI, only 7.54 percent or  ₱7,817,330.20 of the transferred amount was delivered; thereby, thereby causing undue delay in the modernization program of the Bureau. (Observation No. 8)



We recommended that Management: a) require the PITC to fast track the  delivery of the required Information and Communications Technology (ICT) machinery and equipment; and b) follow-up the remittance of the interest earned and refund of  savings from purchases made out of the transferred fund.



8)	Advances to Officers and Employees amounting to ₱109,211.38, remained unliquidated as of year-end contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001, Section 5.8 of COA Circular No. 97-002 and Section 89 of PD 1445, thus, corresponding expenditures were not yet recorded which affected the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements. (Observation No. 9)



We recommended and  Management agreed to: a) require accountable officers concerned to immediately submit liquidation reports and supporting documents to the Accounting Division to settle their accountability; and b) strictly comply with the provisions of COA Circular No. 2012-001, COA Circular No. 97-002 and Section 89 of the PD 1445 relating to liquidation of cash advances.



9)	The funds received by NBI from National Government Agencies (NGAs), Government Owned or Controlled Corporations (GOCCs), and Local Government Units (LGUs) totaling ₱61,836,938.54 remained outstanding as of year-end due to delayed or non-implementation of the intended programs, projects or activities and non-refund of unutilized funds to the Source Agencies (SAs). Liquidation/utilization of funds received for the current year was posted at  5.25 percent or ₱3,424,850.54, thus, the intended purpose of the fund was not fully achieved. (Observation No. 10)



We recommended that Management: a) closely monitor utilization of funds received and see to it that funds are utilized in accordance with its intended purpose; b) enforce the liquidation and refund of long outstanding unutilized fund received; and effect necessary adjusting entries to correct the balance of the accounts; and c) require the Acting Accountant to verify the funds from Other LGUs and liquidate the same, if necessary.



10)	Management was not able to fully utilize its budget and cash allocation for its operation due to the Covid-19 pandemic which affected procurement activities and consequently resulted in the delay and non-implementation of the projects, program and activities. Out of the total allotment received during the year, ₱1,686,042,390.55 or 80.83 percent was obligated; leaving an unexpended balance of ₱399,717,843.45 as of year-end. (Observation No. 11)



We reiterated our previous recommendations that management: a) require  officials/employees concerned to review their programs, projects or activities and fast track  implementation; b) direct  officials/employees concerned to check completeness of supporting documents attached to the contract, Purchase Order (PO) or any claim before funding to facilitate payment thereof; c) issue a memorandum to all concerned, who have valid claims for payment to immediately submit the same, supported with complete documentation to facilitate processing before the year ends; d) continue  monitoring of contracts and POs which require approval with the concerned DOJ officials and facilitate its approval through proper coordination; and e) review and revise  work arrangements of personnel without sacrificing  health protocols during the pandemic to facilitate the processing of documents and undertake early procurement activities.



11)	Copies of Contracts/Purchase Orders (POs) were not furnished/submitted to the Office of the Auditor within five days from the execution of a contract pursuant to  COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, thereby causing undue delay in the conduct of  review thereof. (Observation No. 12)



We recommended that Management require the head of Procurement Management Section to submit to COA all the perfected contracts/Purchase Orders complete with the required documents in compliance with COA Circular 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009.



12)	The agency failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of allocating at least five percent of its total appropriation for  Gender and Development programs during the year whereby  ₱69,403,234.70 or 3.82 percent of the total appropriations  were expended for the purpose contrary to Section 31 of the General Appropriations Act  of FY 2020. (Observation No. 13)



We recommended that Management: a) allocate at least five percent of the total annual budget for the implementation of GAD related activities to comply with the requirements under the general provisions of the GAA; and b) strictly monitor proper implementation of all GAD activities as planned in order to maximize utilization of the GAD funds and to attain its objectives.



13)	The NBI has formulated/identified plans, programs and projects for Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability for CY 2020 pursuant to Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA of FY 2020 or RA 11465. (Observation No. 14)
