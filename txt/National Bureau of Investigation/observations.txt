	AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)	FINANCIAL AUDIT 

		

Unreliable balance of Cash – Collecting Officers (CCO) Account



1)	The Cash-Collecting Officers account with a balance of ₱3,587,397.90 as of December 31, 2020 cannot be relied upon due to: a) presence of negative balance amounting to ₱1,097,575.44 and “Reclass” balance in the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) amounting to ₱13,751.70 which is not in pursuance to Section 4 (8) of PD 1445; and b) unrecorded deposit in the amount of ₱21,840.00.  Also, prior years’ collections amounting to ₱3,235,580.30 remained unremitted in violation of Section 32 of the Revised Cash Examination Manual (RCEM). 



	1)		Section 4 (8) of PD 1445 provides that, generally accepted principles and practices of accounting as well as of sound management and fiscal administration shall be observed. Also, sound management and fiscal administration is characterized by the timely compliance with the rules and regulations as well as recommendations of regulatory and oversight bodies.

	

	2)		Likewise, Section 32 of the RCEM required that: All COs shall deposit intact all their collections, as well as collections turned over to them by sub-collectors/tellers, with authorized government depository bank (AGDB) daily or not later than the next banking day. [47] Where collections are minimal and daily deposit thereof becomes costly and impractical, the COs shall deposit their collections at least once a week, or as soon as the collections reach ₱10,000.00. They shall record all deposits made in the CRR.



  Negative and Reclass balances in the SL 



	3)		Verification disclosed that the negative and the reclass balances noted last year still existed despite of the on-going reconciliations made by the Accounting Division. It was noted that the negative balance amounting to ₱1,097,575.44 increased by 63 percent or ₱423,201.05 compared with that of last year.  The details of which are shown in Annex B.  Likewise, the “Reclass” balance of ₱13,751.70 showed no movement. The “Reclass” balance is a balancing figure/amount set up at the time when the manual accounting system was converted to eNGAS to reconcile balances of the account in the General Ledger (GL).



	4)	Inquiry and analysis of balances disclosed that most of the errors were caused by wrong postings of collections and deposits to SLs of the Accountable Officers (AOs).  Samples of which were as follows:

Amount

Lilibeth Barretto

Error in recording deposit:

The deposit on January 2, 2020 amounting to ₱226,590.00 should be credited to the account of Ms. Escanilla instead of Ms. Barretto as follows:

Clearance fee - ₱172,557.00

BIR                -     52,290.00

Ups                -       1,743.00

Total                ₱226,590.00

₱  226,590.00



	5)		The error in the recording of the deposit to the account of Ms. Barretto in the amount of ₱226,590.00, although it has no effect in the financial statements, resulted in the understatement of her SL balance and overstatement of the SL balance of Ms. Escanilla by the same amount. 

	        

	 Unrecorded deposits

	

	6)		The unrecorded deposits pertained to the account of Ms. A. del Rosario.

Amount

Adelaida del Rosario

Unrecorded deposit made on January 2, 2020 for collections on December 27, 2019 amounting to ₱21,840.00:

Clearance fee -  P16,632.00

BIR                -       5,040.00

UPs                -          168.00

Total                  ₱21,840.00

21,840.00

	

	7)		This deficiency resulted in the overstatement of her SL balance and the Cash – Collecting Officers account by ₱21,840.00 and the related accounts.

	

	

Unremitted Collections of Prior Years

	

	8)		Analysis disclosed that a total of ₱3,235,580.30 prior years’ collections remained unremitted as of year-end in violation of Section 32 of the RCEM.  It was noted that the balance increased by 105 percent or ₱1,659,006.00 from the last year’s balance of ₱1,576,574.44. (Annex C). Inquiry revealed that there is an on-going reconciliation conducted by the Accounting Division of all the balances in the book of accounts.



	9)		In view of the increasing deficiencies noted, it appears that there was laxity in the monitoring and recording of collections and deposits of the Agency’s AOs. Had there been strict compliance with the existing rules and regulations, the deficiencies noted could have been minimized, if not eliminated. 

	10)		We reiterated our recommendations that Management require the Acting Chief Accountant  to:



a)		 speed up the analysis and identification of the accounts with the view of eliminating negative and “Reclass” account balances; 

	

b)		 direct the Collecting Officers/Special Collecting Officers to immediately deposit their unremitted collections, issue demand letters and a memorandum relative thereto;



c)		 withhold the salary of accountable officers corresponding to the unremitted collection, if warranted; and



d)		 prepare necessary journal entry for the unrecorded deposit in the amount of ₱21,840.00.

	

	         Management’s Comments

	

	11)		The Accountant commented that the presence of negative balances on the Cash –Collecting Officers account was due to errors in recording of the Report of Collection and Deposit submitted in prior years. To address the problem, Accountants of the Collection System were designated to reconcile and maintain the SL of Special Collecting Officers (SCOs) including those with negative balances to adjust their records to their correct balances. JEV of those adjustments have been prepared and will be submitted upon complete reconciliation of accounts with attached supporting documents.



	12)		Demand letters were also issued to SCOs for their outstanding balances as of January 31, 2021 with Ref. Nos. Acctg-M-2021-0015 to 0067 and prepared JEV Nos. 2021-03-000337 and 2021-03-000528 to adjust the errors in recording deposits in the amount of 226,590.00 and unrecorded deposit of ₱21,840.00.

	

Auditor’s Rejoinder



	13)			We appreciate the actions taken by the Accounting Division in issuing demand letters to AOs who have undeposited prior years’ collections, copies of which were received thru email on March 17, 2021; adjusting the SL balance of Ms. Adelaida del Rosario in the amount of ₱226,590.00; and taking up the unrecorded deposit amounting to ₱21,840.00 under  JEV Nos. 2021-03-000337 and 2021-03-000528, respectively. 











Misstatement of Due from NGAs account



2)	The Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) account balance of ₱76,182,091.42 as of December 31, 2020 is misstated due to the unrecorded deliveries from Procurement Service-Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) and National Printing Office (NPO) amounting to ₱1,142,101.84 and ₱684,000.00, respectively, thus, adversely affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements.

	1)	Inquiry with the Officer-in-Charge (OIC), Supply and Property Section disclosed that they have yet to receive the Delivery Receipts and its supporting documents as basis in the preparation of the Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR) and Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI); thus, resulting in the non-recording of items delivered in the books of accounts. 



	2)	Further, there was an unreconciled difference of ₱8,249,370.57 between the account balance per books amounting to ₱76,182,091.42 and the PS-DBM confirmed balance of ₱67,932,720.85, indicating lack of reconciliation between the Management and PS-DBM records.

	4)	Our interview with the OIC, Supply and Property Section, revealed that the Forensic Chemistry Division still did not submit the documents pertaining to the purchase of the aforementioned items as basis in the preparation of the IAR and RSMI; hence, this reiteration. Accordingly, the procured items were delivered directly to the Forensic Chemistry Division. 

	

	2.7 	We recommended that Management: 



a)		require the Accounting Division to prepare necessary adjusting entries on the deliveries made and coordinate with PS-DBM to reconcile balances;

	

b)		direct the Supply and Property Section to coordinate with the end-users and submit to the Accounting Division the Inspection and Acceptance Report for delivered items and Report of Supplies and Materials Issued for issuances; and

	

c)		require the Forensic Chemistry Division to submit to Supply and Property Section all documents including the Delivery Receipts relating to deliveries made.

	 

	         Management’s Comment



	1)	Supply and Property Section commented that they did not receive DR from PS DBM pertaining to the two (2) computer softwares amounting to ₱1,142,101.84. With regard to the delivery of accountable forms from NPO, they received the original copy of Delivery Receipt No. 01318 and was forwarded to Accounting Division on Jan. 11, 2021. 



	2)		Accordingly, the documents were already forwarded by the end user but the DR and Sales Invoice were from the Supplier of PS-DBM. As the transaction is with the PS – DBM, they cannot issue the IAR without the DRs from PS DBM. In compliance to the AOM, they requested copies of DR from PS DBM thru issuance of letter dated March 16, 2021. 



Auditor’s Rejoinder



	3)		We appreciate the action taken by Supply and Property Section, Supply Unit  in coordinating with the PS DBM for the issuance of DR for items delivered by the Supplier direct to the NBI end users. With regard to the unrecorded accountable forms from NPO, the Audit Team has not received yet the Accounting Division’s response.

	

	

	Misstated balance of Advances to Special Disbursing Officer (SDO) and Petty Cash (PC) accounts 

	

3)	The balance of Advances to Special Disbursing Officers account amounting to ₱32,802,541.03 as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to the presence of “reclass” balance amounting to ₱3,503,141.03 and inclusion of cash advances for petty operating expenses amounting to ₱828,000.00; thereby affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements.  



1)		

	1)		Chapter 3, Volume III of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) provides that, Advances to Special Disbursing Officers is used to recognize the amount granted to AOs and employees for special purpose/time-bound undertakings to be liquidated within a specified period. It also includes labor payroll for projects undertaken by administration. Credit this account upon liquidation.



	2)	The same manual provides that, Petty Cash account is used to recognize the amount granted to duly designated Petty Cash Custodian for payment of authorized petty or miscellaneous expenses which cannot be conveniently paid through checks. Credit this account every time there is a change of Petty Cash Custodian for refund and liquidation of cash advance.



	3)	Also, Section 35, Chapter 6, Volume II thereof prescribes that the Petty Cash Fund (PCF) to be set up shall be sufficient for the recurring petty operating expenses of the agency for one month. It shall be maintained using the Imprest System. All replenishments shall be directly charged to the expense account and at all times, the PCF shall be equal to the total cash on hand and the unreplenished expenses. The PCF shall be replenished as soon as disbursements reach at least 75 percent or as needed.



	4)	Verification from the accounting records and inquiry from the Acting Chief Accountant revealed that the amount of ₱828,000.00 was inadvertently classified as Advances to Special Disbursing Officers instead of Petty Cash. The cash advances granted to accountable officers are as follows:

	 The error in the classification of the account resulted in the understatement of the Petty Cash account and the overstatement of the Advances to Special Disbursing Officers account by ₱828,000.00, respectively.



	5)	Verification also disclosed that the balances of the Advances to Special Disbursing Officers and Petty Cash accounts include a “reclass” balance which has no supporting documentations amounting to ₱3,503,141.03 and ₱270,369.11, respectively.  The noted deficiencies cast doubts on the reliability of the accounts in the financial statements. 



	6)	Moreover, analysis of the PCF granted to AOs showed that the amount granted exceeded the recurring petty operating expenses for one month contrary to Section 35, Chapter 6, Volume II of the GAM. The details are shown in Annex D.



	7)		We recommended that Management: 



				a)		require the Accounting Division to draw a JEV to properly classify the amount of ₱828,000.00;



				b)		conduct reconciliation of the “reclass” balances of Advances to Special Disbursing Officer and Petty Cash accounts amounting to ₱3,503,141.03 and ₱270,369.11, respectively; 



				c)		      review the operating needs of the Office/Division and adjust the amount of Petty Cash Fund to be granted, if needed; and



				d)		strictly comply with the pertinent provisions in the GAM. 

Unreliable balances of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts



4)	The balance of Property, Plant and Equipment accounts aggregating ₱1,683,370,827.32 as of December 31, 2020 cannot be ascertained due to: a) unreconciled difference of ₱518,741,340.36 between the balance per books and the balance per Report of Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE); and b) the presence of “reclass” balances in various PPE accounts totaling ₱221,696,056.00 which adversely affected the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements. 



1)		

2)		

	1)	Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I, provides for the reconciliation of property and accounting records, the specific portion of which is quoted hereunder as follows:



xxx. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain Property Cards (PC) for PPE in their custody to account for receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPE Ledger Cards maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall be reconciled with other property records like Property Acknowledgement Receipt.



	2)	Comparison of the balance of RPCPPE and the balance of PPE per books in the Regular Fund as of December 31, 2020 showed the following variances:

	3)	Interview with the personnel in the Accounting Division revealed that the variance may be due to misclassification, errors in recording the transactions, unreported lost PPEs, and unreconciled balances during the conversion from manual accounting system to eNGAS. Further inquiry revealed that there is an on-going reconciliation of Accounting Division and Supply and Property Section records on the subject accounts, however, they encountered difficulties in the reconciliation thereof because of the non-availability of records.

	5)	Reclass balances were created at the time when the eNGAS was adopted to support balances in the General Ledger. These balances had no breakdown in the PPELC and should have been subjected to further verification. Personnel concerned in the Accounting Division, and the Supply and Property Section claimed that reconciliation on the “reclass” balances is on-going; however, the balances of these accounts still existed. Thus, casting doubts on the reliability of the balances of these accounts in the financial statements. Had there been periodic reconciliation between the Accounting Division and the Supply and Property Section, the above deficiencies could have been minimized, if not prevented.

	

	6)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Division and the Supply and Property Section/Stockroom Unit to exert extra efforts in their on-going reconciliation of records to verify discrepancies in compliance with the provisions of the GAM and take up the necessary adjustments in the books, if any.

	

	

	Misstated Due to Officers and Employees and Due from Officers and Employees accounts 

	

5)	The erroneous credit of Due from Officers and Employees account amounting to ₱926,506.35 instead of Due to Officers and Employees account in the payment of salaries/wages of project workers and casual employees resulted in the understatement of both accounts by ₱926,506.35contrary to Section 2.c Chapter 3 of the GAM Volume III.



1)	

2)	

3)	

	1)	Section 2.c Chapter 3 of the GAM Volume III, defines the following accounts, to wit:

	

	Due to Officers and Employees is the account used to recognize incurrence of liability to officers and employees for salaries, benefits and other emoluments including authorized expenses advanced by the officers and employees.

	 

	Due from Officers and Employees is the account used to recognize amount of claims from agency's officers and employees for overpayment (not covered by ND), cash shortage, loss of assets and other bills issued by the agency. This account is credited for collection of receivables.

	

	2)	Audit of the Due to Officers and Employees and Due from Officers and Employees accounts revealed that both accounts were understated by ₱926,506.35 due to error in recording payment of salaries/wages of project workers and casual employees. The entry made was debit to Salaries and Wages and credit to Due from Officers and Employees instead of Due to Officers and Employees. Details are as follows:

	3)		The erroneous recording affected the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements.

	

	4)	We recommended that Management:



a)	require the Chief Accountant to prepare necessary adjusting entries to correct erroneous recording and reflect the correct balances of the accounts Due to Officers and Employees and Due from Officers and Employees; and



b)	use the proper accounts in recording transactions of the Agency. 







Management’s Comments



	5)	The Acting Accountant commented that JEV No. 2021-02-000383 dated February 8, 2021 was already prepared. However, the adjustment made amounted to ₱926,956.35 instead of ₱926,506.35 or a difference of P450.00 which pertained to the difference between the amount of payroll per AOM of P91,278.99 and per e-NGAS of P91,728.99 under JEV No. 2020-11-002656. 



  Auditor’s Rejoinder



	6)	Despite the adjustment made, we noted that there is an error in recording adjustments because the Due to Officers and Employees account was debited instead of the Due from Officers and Employee account.





Unreliable balance of Due to NGA account



6)	The Due to NGAs account with a book balance of ₱33,723,239.43 as at year-end is unreliable due to: a) presence of negative balance amounting to ₱482,520.00; and b) temporary account balance of ₱12,097,892.52.



	1)	The Due to NGAs account is used to recognize receipt of funds for delivery of goods/services as authorized by law and fund transfers from NGAs for implementation of specific programs or projects and other inter-agency transactions.

	

	2)	The Due to NGAs account amounting to ₱33,723,239.43 as of year-end consisted of the following SL balances:

	3)		The table above showed that the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (IACAT) has a negative balance of ₱482,520.00 while the temporary account showed a balance of ₱12,097,892.52.  IACAT is a body mandated by law to coordinate and monitor the implementation of RA No. 9208, or the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003, with the Department of Justice (DOJ) as the lead agency. Inquiry revealed that this account had already been closed. The negative balance was just noted and is under reconciliation.

	

	4)	On the other hand, the temporary balance was a balancing figure/amount created during the conversion of the accounting system from manual to the eNGAS.  Verification of the account disclosed that the balance started from ₱94,630,487.64 in 2016, when the manual accounting system was converted to eNGAS, to ₱12,097,892.52 as of year-end. Inquiry revealed that the amount was not totally eliminated due to non-availability of records and the personnel concerned were already separated from the service and some had transferred to other agency. Also, we noted that some adjustments made were not properly explained/supported and submitted to COA for audit.

	

	1)	Due to the materiality of the amount involved and lack of details to support the amount, the accuracy of the account balance is doubtful. 



	2)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Division to:



	a)	exert more efforts in the conduct of reconciliation of accounts by working back on the accounting entries made; and 



	b)	prepare necessary adjustments with proper explanation and supporting documents, if any and submit the same to the Audit Team.

CASH

Ilocos Regional Office (IRO)

Discrepancies amounting to ₱27,380.00 were noted between the cash balance per cash receipts record (CRR) of the Special Collecting Officer (SCO) of the NBI - Laoag District Office (NBI-LaDO) and the Subsidiary Ledger of the Accounting Division of NBI-HO as of December 31, 2020, contrary to Section 74 of PD No. 1445 and other existing accounting rules and regulations, rendering the accuracy of the cash balance as presented in the records doubtful.

We recommended that Management: 



a)	 reconcile the CRR with the SLs of the AD of NBI-HO monthly/quarterly and make necessary adjustment/s, if warranted, to put the cash account balance in order;



b)	submit  the reconciliation report and adjustments made to the Audit Team for validation; and



c)	request from the AD of NBI-CH copy of the SL of the agency and immediately submit the same to the Audit Team.

The Monthly Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) did not include received, issued and unused NBI Clearance/Certificate; thus, the correctness of the reported accountability for  accountable forms by the accountable officer  could not be  determined contrary to Appendix 67, GAM, Vol. II.

	We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation that Management require the Collecting Officer to include the NBI Clearance/ Certificate in the RAAF to ensure that all accountable forms received and issued are properly accounted for. We also recommended that Management submit the same to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed period, for timely audit thereof.

No Management comment yet.



Region IV-A 

Lucena DO

Batangas DO

Monthly Report of Collections and Deposits and Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms were not submitted to the Audit Team within the prescribed period, contrary to Section 122 of P.D. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2009-006; thus timely review and verification thereof could not be  conducted.

	We recommended that the Agent-in-Charge require the concerned AO to submit to COA the Monthly RCD together with the supporting documents and RAAF  within ten days after the end of the month.

The AO was not able to submit their Monthly RCD together with supporting documents and RAAF due to COVID-19 pandemic but  assured the Audit Team on the  submission of succeeding reports on time.



Region VII

Detailed Job Order (JO) personnel from the Provincial Government of Cebu were still allowed/authorized by the Special Collecting Officer (SCO) of NBI CEVRO to collect and receive payments from clients; thus, exposing government funds to the risk of  loss. 





We recommended that Management: 



a)	stop the practice of allowing/ authorizing JO personnel to collect and receive payments from clients of NBI;



b)	assign another bonded personnel of NBI to do the functions of SCO in times when Mr. Villarin is not available or is assigned at another Satellite office; and



c)	require the SCO to perform his functions as CO and refrain from authorizing JO to perform the task in his behalf. 

	

Management commented that said deficiency was already corrected. Another organic employee of NBI was bonded and  assigned in CEVRO to act as an alternate CO in the absence of the present CO.

For validation of the Audit Team. Management did not submit a copy of the Office Order of the alternate CO.



Region VII

1)	The SCO of NBI, CEVRO did not submit the RCD and the Monthly Report of Accountability of Accountable Forms (MRAAF) for the period December 2019, January 2020 to November 2020, contrary to Section 39, Chapter 5, Volume I of GAM, Section 64 of P.D. 1445 



We recommended that the SCO submit the RCD and MRAAF for the period December 2019, January to December 2020.



 



The RCD was prepared and ready for submission the soonest possible time. It could have been made on time if not interrupted by the pandemic that greatly affected the mobility. As to the MRAAF, this has been incorporated in the submission of the Monthly Collection Reports.



Under the GAM Vol. 2, the submission of collection reports shall be done daily or as often as necessary. The Audit Team allowed Management to prepare the reports monthly, as practiced. 

It was noted that during the months of Dec 2019 to Feb 2020, where there was no declaration yet of state of emergency due to Covid-19, the reports have not been submitted at all. 

RO IX,

NBI WEMRO

	Reports of Collections and Deposits (RCDs) are not duly supported with duplicate copies of official receipts (ORs), while the dates and amounts of deposits are not reflected in detail on the RCD, contrary to Section 39(b), Chapter 5, Volume I and Appendix 26, Volume II of the GAM for NGAs.

	  



We recommended that Management:



	a)	ensure that the RCDs are duly supported with complete documents, particularly duplicate copies of ORs issued upon submission to the COA Audit Team; and



	b)	ensure that the RCD is properly accomplished such that dates and amounts of daily deposits are completely reflected.



Management stated that the format of the RCD, specifically as to the summary of deposits below the last entry in the RCD, has been approved by past auditors. They also stated that they have taken note of the recommendations and that they commit to comply accordingly.

The format of the summary to be prepared below the last entry of the RCD per Appendix 26, Vol. II of the GAM for NGAs calls for reporting of daily deposits and not merely the total amount deposited for the month as practiced currently by the Agency.



	Deposit slips for collections amounting to P1,162,740.00 were not machine validated, and all Bureau of Internal Revenue tax payment deposit slips  submitted are only photocopies, contrary to Sections 39b and 40, Chapter 5, Volume I, GAM for NGAs, thereby casting doubt on the validity of the transactions. 

	

We recommended that Management ensure that future submissions of RCDs to the Audit Team are duly supported with original duplicate copies of machine validated deposit slips.



Management stated that it is their practice to turn over collections to a personnel of their AGDB and that the CO returns immediately to her post due to the lack of personnel and that the validation of deposit slips was left unnoticed.



With regard to the submission of photocopy of deposit slip for deposit of BIR tax payments, Management explained that it has been their practice to only submit photocopies to the AT from the time they started receiving collections.



Lastly, Management stated that the deficiencies will be given due attention and that they will be strictly implementing the recommendations in their future reports.

Section 39b, Chapter 5, Volume I, GAM for NGAs requires submission of machine validated deposit slip  and the lack of validation  may indicate that the collections have not been deposited to the Agency’s account/s.



Moreover, the GAM for NGAs requires the COs to prepare three copies of deposit slip before actual deposit to AGDB and one of the original copies shall be attached to the RCD. Hence, attaching photocopy deposit slip to the RCD is contrary to the requirements of the GAM for NGAs.

Region XI – SEMRO

		The frequent cancellation of Official Receipts, totaling 105 ORs for the period CY 2019 to 2020 resulted in the wastage of government resources which is not in accordance with Section 2 of PD No. 1445.

We recommended that Management direct the Collecting Officer to exercise due care in the issuance and cancellation of Official Receipts (ORs) pursuant to Section 2 of PD No. 1445. 

Management accepted the audit observations and assured the Audit Team that they will adhere to the audit recommendation.

		



The Audit Team will validate the extent of the actions taken by Management on the implementation of the audit recommendations.

RO 16, RSAO

		One hundred sixty two thousand (162,000 sheets of obsolete NBI clearance forms with undetermined value remained undisposed as of audit date, contrary to Section 2 of PD No. 1445,

We recommended that Management make a representation with the NBI Head Office for immediate disposal of obsolete NBI Clearance Forms to prevent improper usage. 





PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Ilocos Regional Office (IRO)

The accuracy and completeness of the Agency’s Report on the Physical Count of Plant, Property and Equipment (RPCPPE) could not be ascertained due to  deficiencies in the handling and recording of PPE, contrary to the provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM).



We recommended that Management instruct the Property Custodian PC/ Inventory Committee (IC) to:



a.	revise the RPCPPE and fill up all the necessary data as provided under Appendix 73, Volume II of the GAM and resubmit the same to COA Office;



b.	prepare necessary IIRUP for all unserviceable properties and request NBI-HO for its proper disposal, and submit the same to COA Office; 



c.	submit to COA Office copies of PAR, PC and PPELC for all PPEs; and



d.	reconcile PPE records with the records of the Supply and Property Section and Accounting Division of NBI-HO and effect necessary adjustments, if warranted, to reflect the correct balances, and submit reconciliation report and adjustments made to  COA Office.

The management committed that it will send a request letter to the NBI-CO for copies of the PPELC of all its PPE items and for the reconciliation of its PPE records. It also committed that it will monitor the said request until its PPE records are fully reconciled. It also committed to submit to the COA Office the documents cited in the AOM.



RO II, Tuguegarao

The designated Property Custodian was still not bonded as of December 31, 2020, despite previous year’s recommendation to do so, contrary to Section 101 of PD 1445 thus, exposing government properties to possible risk in case of loss.

We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation that Management require the Property Officer - Designate to immediately file his application for bond with the Bureau of the Treasury in compliance to Section 101 of PD 1445. We also recommended that the Agency Head make a follow-up to expedite the process on the application in the Head Office, if warranted by the situation.

Management agreed to implement the audit recommendation.



RO II, Tuguegarao

DOs

The NBI-RO and its two DOs at Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya and Isabela, Ilagan City, Isabela failed to conduct physical inventory of  properties in CY 2020; thereby casting doubt on the existence of the reported balances of PPEs in the RO, contrary to Chapter 10, Section 38 of the GAM.

	We recommended that Management:

	

a)		create a separate Inventory Committee (IC) in the region to conduct physical inventory of all properties of the agency, in the absence of the IC from Head Office; and

	

b)		require the Inventory Committee to submit Inventory Report to Head Office for evaluation and consolidation and to the Audit Team not later than January 31, of each year pursuant to Chapter 10, Section 38 of the GAM.  





RO II, Tuguegarao

Unserviceable/obsolete properties stored in the Office of the NBI-CAVRO were not yet disposed of contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 1445. Likewise, said properties were not reported in the IIRUP despite previous year’s recommendation to do so contrary to paragraph D of Section 40 of Volume III of the GAM for NGAs.

	We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation that Management:

	

a)	report all unserviceable properties in the IIRUP as of December 31, 2020 pursuant to Section 40 under paragraph d of the GAM;



b)	create a Disposal Committee to attend the immediate disposal of the agency’s obsolete and unserviceable PPE pursuant to Sec. 79 of PD 1445; and



c)	direct the Appraisal Committee to appraise the cost of the assets/properties that could not be identified and submit the result to the Disposal Committee for reference.





Region IV-A Lucena DO

The RPCPPE for CY 2020 was not submitted to the Office of the Auditor, contrary to Section 38 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus, the accuracy and existence of the reported balances of PPEs in the RO could not be ascertained.











	We recommended that the Agent-in-Charge instruct the Supply Officer/Record Officer to prepare and submit the RPCPPE as at year-end within the prescribed period. 

Management will comply in the submission of RPCPPE for CY 2020. Accordingly, they already prepared the report and waiting its  approval.



The Supply/Record Officer submitted the RPCPPE for CY 2020 to the Audit Team on February 2, 2021

Validation was made on the submitted RPCPPE and disclosed that it includes semi-expendable items and unserviceable properties.

Batangas Regional Office

The completeness and valuation of PPEs in the RPCPPE of the NBI – CALABARZON as of December 31, 2020 could not be determined due to the absence of unit cost, total cost of properties, quantity per stock card, among others and inclusion of some tangible items considered as semi-expendable properties worth ₱404,725.51 contrary to Sections 38, 3(e) and 10, Chapters 10 and 8, respectively, of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, and Appendix 73 of Volume II.

	We recommended that the Regional Director instruct the Supply Officer or Records Officer to include in the RPCPPE the unit cost, total cost, no of items, etc. We also recommended that the Regional Director  require the Property Custodian to coordinate with the Supply Accountable Officer (SAO) of NBI – CALABARZON for reconciliation of records and adjustment of discrepancies noted to reflect the correct balances of PPE.

	

	 

Management  promised to include the required data/information in the RPCPPE and to make adjustments on discrepancies noted to reflect the correct PPE balance.



Region IV-B, Calapan

The valuation of the PPE of NBI IV-B, Calapan City in the RPCPPE as of December 31, 2020  could not be ascertained due to incomplete information/data of  properties in the report contrary to Section 42.g, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I

We recommended that the Acting Regional Director direct the Property Custodian to properly accomplish the RPCPPE and supply all the required information in accordance with the GAM.







Region IV-B , Calapan

Disposal of unserviceable properties amounting to P182,540.92 has not yet been undertaken by the Agency which is not in conformity with Section 79 of PD No. 1445. Thus,  may result to further deterioration and deprive the  NBI MIMAROPA of a higher recoverable amount had these properties been immediately disposed through sale or negotiation

	We recommended that the Acting Regional Director  instruct the Property Custodian to exert more efforts in facilitating the disposal of all obsolete and/or unserviceable properties and undertake necessary actions in accordance with Section 79 of PD 1445.







Region IV-B, PUERDO

The accuracy and existence of the PPE balance amounting to  P1,144,229.08 in RO IV-B could not be ascertained due to: (a) non-conduct of annual physical count; (b)  absence of property tags/markings on PPEs; (c) non-issuance of Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) to end –users;  (d) non-maintenance of Property Cards; and (e) non-inclusion of transferred PPEs amounting to P182,696.00 tin RO IVB in the accounting records of Head Office contrary to the pertinent provisions of the GAM, Volume I. 



 



We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation that the Chief, NBI PUERDO, through the Property Custodian (PC) cause/ facilitate the creation of Inventory Committee that will conduct the periodic physical count of all PPE of NBI PUERDO.



We also recommended that the Chief, NBI PUERDO:



a)	require the Property Custodian  to submit the RPCPPE to the Audit Team not 	later than January 31 of each year and the IIRUP pursuant to the provisions of Sections 38, 42 and 40(d) of GAM, Chapter 10, Volume I;

	We recommended  that Management:

	

	a. require the Administrative Officer to secure copy of property records from the Supply and Property Section and Accounting Division of NBI HO for valuation of properties included in the reports;

	 

	b. create an Inspection and Disposal Committee (IDC) that shall recommend the appropriate mode of disposal and appraisal of properties in case of  sale; and 

	

	c. require the IDC to  immediately  dispose  unserviceable properties.

Region VI-WEVRO

The RPCPPE lacks the necessary information to determine the unit cost/ value of some of the properties listed therein, contrary to the instructions contained in Appendix 73 of the GAM, Volume II, thus the total cost of properties of the RO cannot be established.

	We recommended that Management:   

	

	a. follow-up the request to secure copy of property records from the Supply and Property Section and Accounting Division – NBI HO for valuation of properties of the RO; and 

	

	b require the person in charge in the preparation of the RPCPPE to indicate complete information as to the cost/value of properties reported therein.

	1)		The failure of the aforementioned officers/employees to immediately settle their outstanding/unsettled balances was contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001, COA Circular No. 97-002 and Section 89 of the PD 1445 which resulted in non-recording of the corresponding expenditures incurred in a particular period thereby affecting the fair presentation of the account in the financial statements. 

	

	2)		We recommended and Management agreed to: 

	

	a)	require the accountable officers concerned to immediately submit liquidation reports and supporting documents to the Accounting Division to settle their accountability; and

	

	b)	strictly comply with the provisions of COA Circular No. 2012-001, COA Circular No. 97-002 and Section 89 of the PD 1445 relating to liquidation of cash advances.



	         Management’s Comment

	

9.7    During the exit conference, the Acting Accountant commented that they already issued a Memorandum to the concerned officers to submit their liquidation reports and supporting documents. Accordingly, some of the cash advances were already liquidated.

	

	        Auditor’s Rejoinder

	

 9.8      We appreciate the action taken by the Acting Accountant. We request the immediate submission of liquidation reports together with supporting documents and the corresponding JEV taking up the liquidation to the Audit Team.





Unutilized funds received from various agencies and non-liquidation thereof 



2)	The funds received by NBI from National Government Agencies (NGAs), Government Owned or Controlled Corporations (GOCCs), and Local Government Units (LGUs) totaling ₱61,836,938.54 remained outstanding as of year-end due to delayed or non-implementation of the intended programs, projects or activities and non-refund of unutilized funds to the Source Agencies (SAs). Liquidation/utilization of funds received for the current year was posted at 5.25 percent or ₱3,424,850.54; thus, the intended purpose of the fund was not fully achieved.

	6)		The table above showed that except for the fund received from DENR, the rest of the funds from various agencies were not utilized during the calendar year. Inquiry from the Acting Accountant revealed that funds amounting to ₱7,409,040.45 from various sources should have been refunded/liquidated to the SAs but held in abeyance pending submission of documents and result of verification of the status of the projects from the implementing offices of NBI. These are as follows:

	7)		The fund received from Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) also showed an unutilized balance of ₱50,524,850.09.  The amount represents the accumulated monthly share of NBI from Small Town Lottery (STL) for medical benefits of employees. However, we noted in the MOA that there was no timeline or deadline set in the implementation of the project. 

	

	8)		In view of the significance of the unutilized funds received, we are concerned that the purpose of the fund transfer was not fully achieved and there was failure to take immediate action on the unexpended/excess balances on projects, programs and activities undertaken.



	1)		We recommended that Management:

	

	a)		closely monitor utilization of funds received and see to it that funds are utilized in accordance with its intended purpose; 

	

	b)		enforce the liquidation and refund of long outstanding unutilized fund received; and effect necessary adjusting entries to correct the balance of the accounts; and

	

	c)			require the Acting Accountant to verify the funds from Other LGUs and liquidate the same, if necessary.

		



Unobligated allotment and unpaid obligations at year-end



3)	Management was not able to fully utilize its budget and cash allocation for its operation due to the Covid-19 pandemic which affected procurement activities and consequently resulted in the delay and non-implementation of the projects, program and activities.  Out of the total allotment received during the year, ₱1,686,042,390.55 or 80.83 percent was obligated; leaving an unexpended balance of ₱399,717,843.45 as of year-end.

	4)		Also, of the total cash allocation received amounting to ₱1,903,464,095.00, the amount of ₱242,366,762.43 was automatically reverted to the National Treasury. 



	5)		Inquiry revealed that the unobligated allotment and the unused cash allocation was caused by delayed procurement activities brought about by the Covid 19 pandemic which consequently resulted in the delay or non-implementation of the programs, projects and activities. Further inquiry revealed that some of the causes are delay in the approval of contracts because it has to be evaluated and approved by the DOJ; incomplete documentations; failure of bidding; and delayed turn-over by the lessor of the building with unobligated amount for the rental of ₱216,900,000.00. Thus, the intended benefits were not maximized.

a)		require officials/employees concerned to review their programs, projects or activities and fast track implementation;

	

b)		direct officials/employees concerned to check completeness of supporting documents attached to the contract, Purchase Order (PO) or any claim before funding to facilitate payment thereof;

	

c)		issue a memorandum to all concerned, who have valid claims for payment to immediately submit the same, supported with complete documentation to facilitate processing before the year ends; 

	

d)		continue monitoring of contracts and POs which require approval with the concerned DOJ officials and facilitate its approval through proper coordination; and

	

e)		review and revise work arrangements of personnel without sacrificing health protocols during the pandemic to facilitate the processing of documents and undertake early procurement activities.

	

	

Non-submission of Contracts/POs within the prescribed period



4)	Copies of Contracts/Purchase Orders were not furnished/submitted to the Office of the Auditor within five days from the execution of a contract pursuant to COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, thereby causing undue delay in the conduct of review thereof.

Gender and Development (GAD)



5)	The agency failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of allocating at least five percent of its total appropriations for Gender and Development programs during the year whereby ₱69,403,234.70 or 3.82 percent of the total appropriations were expended for the purpose contrary to Section 31 of the General Appropriations Act of FY 2020.



	1)		Section 31 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020 provides: Programs and Projects Related to Gender and Development. All agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022). The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. 



	2)		For CY 2020, the agency had a total appropriations of ₱1,814,348,000.00 in the GAA, five percent or ₱90,717,400.00 of which should have been allocated for GAD related projects/activities. Evaluation of the Annual GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) for FY 2020 revealed that the total expenses incurred amounted to ₱69,403,234.70 or 3.82 percent of the total appropriations in the GAA. It was also noted that nine out of 10 activities were implemented. Details are shown as follows:
