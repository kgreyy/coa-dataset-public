D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial and compliance audits of the accounts and 

operations of the Technology Application and Promotion Institute for the year ended 

December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to (a) ascertain the level of assurance 

that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements, (b) 

recommend agency’s improvement opportunities, (c) determine the propriety of 

transactions as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and 

regulations, and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit 

recommendations. 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report  
 

A qualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements as at December 

31, 2020, as the Agency’s Accounts Payable has misstatements totaling 

₱20,757,434.80 which represent 7.07 percent of its total liabilities while Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficits) and Other General Services have misstatements of P47,551,267.15 

or 7.69 percent of the Net Assets/Equity. In addition, the accuracy, existence, and 

reliability of Inter-Agency Receivables, Other Receivables, and Inter-Agency 

Payables are affected due to various accounting deficiencies of ₱172,909,979.64 or 

18.96% of its total assets.  

 

F. Summary of Other Significant Observations and Recommendations 
  

The other significant observations and recommendations, discussed in detail in 

Part II of the report are as follows: 

 

1. Funds Transfers (FTs) received by the TAPI from the Department of Science 

and Technology - Central Office (DOST-CO) for the implementation of the 

Technology Innovation for Commercialization (TECHNICOM) amounting to 

₱49,565,284.01, covering the project duration from January 1 to December 31, 

2019, and additional funding of ₱15,874,745.42, covering the project duration 

from January 1 to December 31, 2020, were re-transferred by the TAPI to 

various project proponents. 

 

We recommended and the Management agreed to: 

 

a. Ensure compliance with the provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013 
that funds for the implementation of the projects be released by the SAs 

directly to the IAs to avoid circuitous transfer of trust funds and to 

avoid discrepancies in the MOA executed for the implementation of the 

project; 

 

b. Stop the circuitous transfer of funds, instead, directly release the funds 
to the actual implementers of the project to avoid overlapping of 



iv 

 

functions and clearly delineate the duties of the DOST and its attached 

agencies;   

 

c. Ensure the timely release of funds to the IAs as it is a critical aspect of 
project implementation and make certain that project objectives are 

achieved and translated into measurable outputs within the set time 

periods; and 

 

d. Require the Project personnel to send demand letters to the 
IAs/proponents for the accumulated outstanding balance of receivables 

for transfers during 2018 and prior years, stating definite deadlines and 

the possible blacklisting/legal action that may be instigated against 

them in case of non-compliance to exhaust all possible remedies to 

compel the IAs/proponents to liquidate their long-outstanding 

balances. 

 

2. The granting and utilization of Cash Advance amounting to ₱1,300,000.00 for 
the reimbursement of Travel Expenses of provincial Finalists in the National 

Invention Contest conducted by TAPI are irregular due to the absence of 

guidelines in the reimbursement of travel expenditures using a rate of 

percentage, contrary to Republic Act No. 7459 and resulting in uncertainty on 

the propriety and validity of payments thereto. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to:  

 

a. Request the Screening Committee to comment/act on the issues 

raised regarding the reimbursement of travel expenses different 

from the allowed amount provided in RA 7459 and adjust them as 

may be necessary; and 

 

b. Observe appropriate control measures on the disbursements of 

government funds and ensure that all payments are in accordance 

with accounting and auditing rules and regulations. 

 

3. Inter-Agency Receivables, Other Receivables, and Inter-Agency Payables 
accounts with a total value of ₱172,909,979.64 as at December 31, 2020, 

remained unaccounted, unliquidated, and dormant due to: (a) insufficient 

supporting documents; (b) inadequate monitoring and reconciliation of prior 

years’ carry-over and negative account balances of the accounts Due from 

NGAs, Due from NGOs/CSO’s, Other Receivables, and Due to NGAs; and (c) 

non-submission of supporting schedules pertaining to the detailed transactions 

per project by the TAPI’s project personnel, thus, affecting Management’s 

assertions on the existence, accuracy, validity, and completeness of reported 

account balances.   

 



v 

 

 Unaccounted, unliquidated and dormant account balances of Due from 
NGAs/ Due from NGOs/CSOs/Other Receivables  

 

We recommended and the Management agreed to: 

 

a. Require the Accountant and the Project personnel who are responsible 
for the project implementation to conduct a document verification as 

well as site validation of the selected projects, especially those with FTs 

above ₱1 million; 

 

b. Reconcile TAPI's records with that of the IAs’ accounting records and  
make the necessary adjustments; 

 

c. Continue to exert effort to enforce the provisions of DOST AO No. 11, 
series of 2020 and COA Circular No. 2007-001 on the reporting 

requirements for the grants, i.e., both technical and financial reports; 

and 

 

d. Continue to send demand letters to Project leaders/grantees, stating the 
deadlines with stern warning of possible legal action that may be lodged 

against them for their complete disregard to comply. 

 

 Unreconciled account balance of Due from NGAs-PS-DBM 

 

We recommended and the Management agreed to: 

 

a. Require the Property Officer and the Accountant to coordinate with 

the PS-DBM representatives to settle the unreconciled difference of 

₱3,646,118.87 between the TAPI books and the PS-DBM books as at 

December 31, 2020; and  

 

b. Orient the newly hired Property Officer of the need to regularly 

conduct reconciliation of the property records and accounting records 

to resolve the differences or issues affecting their balances with that of 

the PS-DBM records at any given time/period. 

 

 Negative balance of Due to NGAs account 
 

We recommended and the Management agreed to: 

 

a. Assign/hire additional manpower for the maintenance of 
SLs/schedules; 

 

b. Maintain/update the SLs for individual projects and tally these with the 
GL; 



vi 

 

c. Reconcile the inter-agency accounting records and to make 
adjustments, as may be necessary; and 

 

d. Require the Project personnel to submit the financial reports and   
supporting schedules within the prescribed period.

Auditee through the issuance of the Summary of Observations and Recommendations 

(SAOR) and their comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate.
