PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
Financial Audit 
 

Accounting Errors 

1. The Technology Application and Promotion Institute’s (TAPI’s) Statement of 
Financial Position as at December 31, 2020 is not fairly presented due to 
misstatements in Accounts Payable amounting to P20,757,434.80, which represents 
7.07 percent of its total liabilities, while the Net Assets/Equity has misstatements of 
P47,551,267.15, which represents 7.69 percent of its total amount as at December 31, 
2020, resulting in over/understatements of the affected accounts. Due to the 
significant impact of such misstatements on the reported balances of the affected 
accounts, Management’s assertions as to the accuracy, existence, validity, rights and 
obligations, and valuation of the said accounts could not be relied upon. 
 
2. Paragraph 15 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 
and Section 3, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, states 
that “Financial statements are a structured representation of the financial position and 
financial performance of an entity. The objectives of general purpose financial statements 
are to provide information about the financial position, financial performance, and cash 
flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making and evaluating decisions 
about the allocation of resources.” The standards further states that specifically, the 
objectives of general purpose financial reporting in the public sector should be to provide 
information useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the accountability of the entity 
for the resources entrusted to it. 
 
3. Paragraph 27 of the IPSAS 1 provides that, “Financial statements shall present 
fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair 
presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, 
and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, 
liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, with 
additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that 
achieve a fair presentation.” 
  
4. In our audit of the accounts of Technology Application and Promotion Institute 
(TAPI), we noted some errors/omission resulting in misstatements of account balances 
reported in the financial statements of the Institute, as summarized in Table 1.

Details of accounting errors and omissions: 
 
Misstatements in Liability account of ₱20,757,434.80 
 
6. Section 15, Chapter 2 of the GAM, Volume I, states that “The Financial statements 
shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an 
entity.  Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, 
other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for 
assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSAS.” 
 
7. The Revised Chart of Accounts of GAM, Volume III, prescribes the use of 
Accounts Payable to recognize receipt of goods or services on account in the normal course 
of trade and business operation.  Debit this account for payment or settlement of liabilities.   
 
8. Moreover, item 4.6 of Commission on Audit and Department of Budget and 
Management (COA-DBM) Joint Circular (JC) No. 2013-1 dated January 3, 2013, on 
Revised Guidelines on the Submission of Quarterly Accountability Reports on 
Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations and Disbursements also states that, “Accounts 
Payable are obligations of government agencies, whether current year or prior years, for 
which services had been rendered, goods have been delivered or projects have been 
completed and accepted.” 
 
9. Verification of Due and Demandable obligations in the Aging Schedule in Financial 
Accountability Report (FAR) No. 3 as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that the unpaid 
obligations in the General Fund (GF) amounted to ₱14,524,660.34, while the Institute 
recognized the Trust Fund’s (TF) unpaid obligated payables amounting to ₱17,021,882.42 
for CY 2020. The total unpaid obligations of P31,546,542.76 at year-end did not tally with 
the reported ₱0.00 balance in the Accounts Payable account reflected in the Statement of 
Financial Position. 
 
10. The accounting entries made for the recognition of these Due and Demandable 
unpaid obligations in both funds were as follows: 

 
Account Title 

GF TF 

Debit Credit Debit Credit 

Various Expenses 14,524,660.34  17,021,882.42  

Accumulated Surplus/Deficits  14,524,660.34  17,021,882.42 

 
11. Analysis of the entries disclosed that the use of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficits) 
account to credit the amount did not appropriately define the transactions recorded as these 
were unpaid obligations of the agency which should be accounted as Accounts Payable 
(AP).  Verbal inquiry with the new Officer-in-Charge of the Accounting Section disclosed 
that she overlooked the entries since it was formatted from last year. Further consideration 
of the entries effected in the GF vis-à-vis the amount of FAR’s due and demandable 



33 
 

revealed that out of the P14,524,660.34, only P3,735,552.38 was found as Accounts 
Payable while the P10,789,107.96 recorded as Financial Assistance (FA) to 
NGAs/NGOs/CSOs should be considered as only a plain commitment of the agency for 
projects yet to be implemented and subject for disclosure in the Notes to FS only. 
 
12. While the P17,021,882.42 TF’s amounts pertain to transactions with funding from 
other NGAs for implementation of specific projects, verification showed that these were 
entries to recognize unpaid obligated payables for 2020 credited to Accumulated 
Surplus/(Deficit) instead of Accounts Payable in the Institute’s financial records; thus, the 
incorrect use of account.   

 
13. The newly assigned OIC of the Accounting Section explained that she overlooked 
the entries since it was formatted from last year. 
 
14. The erroneous entries resulted in the understatement of Accounts Payable by 
P20,757,434.80, and consequently, the overstatement of Accumulated Surplus/Deficits by 
the same amount.  

 
15. We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations, with modification, and  
Management agreed to: 
 

a. require the new Accountant to recognize Accounts Payable in the books 
for obligations of the agency, whether current year or prior years, for 
which services had been rendered, goods have been delivered or projects 
have been completed;  

 
b. henceforth, ensure prudent reporting of transactions to FAR’s obligated 

due and demandable which should reconcile with the Accounts Payable 
account of the agency, especially at year-end; and 

 
c. include in the Notes to FS the transactions pertaining to payables on 

transfer of funds which remained as the agency’s commitment at year-end. 
 
Erroneous recording of expenses under Contracts of Service 
 
16. The Revised Chart of Accounts under the GAM, Volume III prescribes the use of 
the Other Professional Services account for the cost of other professional services 
contracted by the agency not otherwise classified under any of the specific professional 
services accounts. The Other General Services account is used to recognize the cost of 
other general services contracted by the agency not otherwise classified under any of the 
specific general services account.  
 
17. Section 5.1 of the COA-DBM JC No. 02, s. 2020 dated October 20, 2020 states that 
COS refers to the engagement of the services of an individual, private firm, other 
government agency, non-governmental agency or international organization as consultant, 



34 
 

learning service provider or technical expert to undertake special project or job within a 
specific period. 
 
18. Moreover, Section 8.0 of the same Joint Circular provides that, “payment of 
services of individuals hired through COS shall be charged against the Maintenance and 
Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) in the approved agency budget.” 
 
19. Analysis of the Other Professional Services account as of December 31, 2020 
revealed inclusions of salaries/wages sourced from General Fund and Trust Fund 
amounting to P5,908,325.08 and P20,885,507.27, respectively, or totaling P26,793,832.35 
for 68 COS personnel. Management commented that the budget for the salary of the COS 
Personnel was approved by the DBM under the Other Professional Services account. 
 
20. The nature of the positions and the jobs performed by the individually hired COS 
personnel as defined in the aforementioned JC could not be appropriately recorded under 
the Other Professional Services account since their expertise were tapped as general 
services to support the agency’s programs and activities for a specific period of time; thus, 
the Other Professional Services is overstated by P26,793,832.35 and the Other General 
Services is correspondingly understated by the same amount.  
 
21. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Unit to 
observe the use of the Other General Services account to record the payment of 
services of individuals hired through Contract of Service transactions and to refrain 
from using the account Other Professional Services. 
 

Accounting/Reporting Deficiencies 

 
Outstanding account balances of assets and liabilities 
  
22. Inter-Agency Receivables, Other Receivables, and Inter-Agency Payables 
accounts with a total value of ₱172,909,979.64 as at December 31, 2020, remained 
unaccounted, unliquidated, and dormant due to: (a) insufficient supporting 
documents; (b) inadequate monitoring and reconciliation of prior years’ carry-over 
and negative account balances of the accounts Due from NGAs, Due from 
NGOs/CSO’s, Other Receivables, and Due to NGAs; and (c) non-submission of 
supporting schedules pertaining to detailed transactions per project by the TAPI’s 
project personnel, thus, affecting Management’s assertions on the existence, 
accuracy, validity, and completeness of reported account balances. 

 
23. Section 110 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 provides that government 
accounting shall aim to (1) produce information concerning past operations and present 
conditions; (2) provide a basis for guidance for future operations; (3) provide for control 
of the acts of public bodies and officers in the receipt, disposition and utilization of funds 
and property; and (4) report on the financial position and the results of operations of 
government agencies for the information of all persons concerned. 



35 
 

24. Section 111 thereof provides that (1) the accounts of an agency shall be kept in such 
detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to 
furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government, and (2) the 
highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping 
of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. 

 
25. As a strategic partner in advancing national socio-economic growth, the Institute’s 
primary role in providing grants and/or venture financing for new and/or emerging projects 
can be noted in two (2) major accounts reflected in the FS namely, the agency’s total 
Receivables and the Inter-Agency Payables accounts with balances of P555,593,102.85 
and P291,506,392.17, respectively, as at December 31, 2020. These accounts were subject 
of audit observations in the past years’ Annual Audit Reports (AARs) as inadequately 
monitored and with unreconciled account balances, hence, courses of action were 
recommended in which Management agreed to implement.  

 

26. However, similar to the previous observations, the following accounting 
deficiencies which affected the reliability and accuracy of reported balances in the FSs 
were still prevalent in CY 2020, as shown in Table 3:  
 

Table 3. Accounting Deficiencies

Out of the recorded amount in the accounts of Due from NGAs, Due from NGOs/CSOs, 

and Other Receivables, P1,927,564.63 or 72 percent; P920,623.48 or 57.19 percent; and 

P8,168,217.03 or 91.30 percent, respectively, were without any partial liquidation submitted 

by the implementing agencies (IAs) showing any activity for the projects being implemented 

or without reports by the project personnel assigned; 
 

 Confirmation of Due from NGAs accounts with fund transfers released during CY 2020 
revealed a P3,741,039.23 variance from ongoing and completed projects between the 

recorded amount in accounting records and confirmed amount from the IAs, hence, 

unrecorded liquidations in the books of the agency. 

 

Due from NGAs – 

PS DBM 
3,646,118.87 

The account balance of P4,922,100.42 as of December 31, 2020 far exceeded the Due to 

NGAs account maintained by the Procurement Service which exhibits the confirmed amount 

of P1,275,981.55 only or a difference of P3,646,118.87 due to non-reconciliation of their prior 

years’ balances. 

Due to NGAs 3,182,145.97 

The year-end account balance of P291,098,531.65, which is not supported with 

SLs/schedules/detailed breakdown or supporting schedules included P3,182,145.97 in

Unaccounted, unliquidated and dormant account balances of Due from NGAs/ Due from 
NGOs/CSOs/Other Receivables  
 
27. As can be observed, the unliquidated amounts consisted of those accounts with the 
ages of two (2) to more than 10 years, of which the account balances pertain to more than 
half of the fund transfers. Analysis revealed that those projects recorded under the Due 
from NGAs and Other Receivables with a more than one (1) million project cost or the total 
of P61,474,767.26 and P33,500,372.65, respectively, were undertaken by only 12 
Implementing Agencies (IAs) and 13 entities which could have been rigorously monitored 
and followed up, but records showed no efforts were exerted.  Interview with the 
Accountant disclosed that one of the main causes of the significant amounts was the 
absence of a turn-over by the previously responsible project personnel; thus, the difficulty 
in retrieving the supporting documents despite the accounting personnel’s efforts to comply 
with the recommended actions to strictly enforce the provisions of DOST Administrative 
Order (A.O.) No. 011, series of 2020, dated September 02, 2020,  COA Circular No. 2007-
001 dated October 25, 2007, and the Memoranda of Agreement on the repayment and 
reporting requirements.     
 
28. On the other hand, the Management informed us that their Legal Unit had already 
sent demand and follow-up letters to the IAs for projects that have remained with long 



37 
 

outstanding receivables. Unfortunately, however, with the nationwide effect of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, Management’s follow-up actions have been partially affected. 
Nevertheless, even with its slow-phased implementation of our prior year’s audit 
recommendations, Management did not rectify the noted condition of the unaccounted 
balances as the same condition still existed as at the end of CY 2020; thus, continuously 
affecting the reliability, accuracy and existence of the account balances. 
 
29. We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations, with modification, and 
Management agreed to: 

 
a. Require the Accountant and the Project personnel who are responsible for 

the project implementation to conduct a document verification as well as 
site validation of the selected projects, especially those with FTs above ₱1 
million; 

 
b. Reconcile TAPI's records with that of the IAs’ accounting records and  

make the necessary adjustments; 
 
c. Continue to exert effort to enforce the provisions of DOST AO No. 11, 

series of 2020 and COA Circular No. 2007-001 on the reporting 
requirements for the grants, i.e., both technical and financial reports; and 

 
d. Continue to send demand letters to Project leaders/grantees, stating the 

deadlines with stern warning of possible legal action that may be lodged 
against them for their complete disregard to comply. 

 
Unreconciled account balance of Due from NGAs-PS-DBM 
 
30. Review of the Institute’s accounting records from January 1 to December 31, 2020 
showed an ending balance of the account Due from NGAs-PS-DBM per books in the 
amount of P4,922,100.42. Confirmation made from the PS-DBM, however, revealed that 
the balance of the Institute’s account in their Statement of Account-Customers amounted 
only to P1,275,981.55, thus, reflecting a variance of P3,646,118.87. Balances of the 
account Due from NGAs-PS-DBM per books as against the balance of PS-DBM Statement 
of Account-Customers as at December 31, 2020, is shown in Table 4. 
 

Table 4. Summary of Variances between TAPI Books and PS-DBM Books as at December 31, 2020

38 
 

31. The Institute’s total advances to the PS-DBM from January 1 to December 31, 2020 
amounted to P858,830.46 as evidenced by duly approved Agency Procurement Request 
(APR) with no record of actual fare expenses/deliveries received from PS-DBM during the 
same period. The variances between TAPI books and PS-DBM books were identified as 
debits in the account during the year amounting to P520,691.24 and credits in the account 
during the year amounting to P233,220.99 which resulted in the total amount of 
P753,912.23 incurred during CY 2020 plus the beginning balance of variance from prior 
years of P2,892,206.64. The total of P3,646,118.87 unreconciled variances between the 
Agency books and the PS-DBM Statement of Account-Customers as at December 31, 2020 
pertains to the undelivered portion of the requisitioned plane tickets, and supplies and 
materials.  

 
32. Inquiry with Management revealed that the process of reconciliation of the inter-
agency accounts has not been fully established due to incomplete documentation. Hence, 
the validity of the balance of the Due from NGAs-PS-DBM account is doubtful. We also 
noted that reconciliation of the balance per books with that of the PS-DBM was not done 
due to the lack of accountable officers, i.e., to be primarily assigned in the reconciliation 
of variances. At present, the newly hired Property Officer, together with the Procurement 
Officer and the Accountant, will assume the responsibility in the reconciliation of accounts. 
 
33. We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations, with modification,  and  
Management agreed to: 
 

a. require the Property Officer and the Accountant to coordinate with the 
PS-DBM representatives to settle the unreconciled difference of 
P3,646,118.87 between the TAPI books and the PS-DBM books as at 
December 31, 2020; and  
 

b. orient the newly hired Property Officer of the need to regularly conduct  
reconciliation of the property records and accounting records to resolve 
the differences or issues affecting their balances with that of the PS-DBM 
records at any given time/period. 

 

Negative balance of Due to NGAs account 
 

34. The Due to NGAs account with the recorded amount of P291,098,531.65 as at 
December 31, 2020 included negative balances amounting to P3,182,145.97, which has 
been carried over from the previous years.  
 
35. Verification of the accounting records of  Due to NGAs showed that the Accounting 
Section maintains a General Ledger (GL) of the transactions during the period while the 
per project Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) were not regularly reconciled and remained 
unsubmitted during the year due to floating amounts and the prior years’ forwarded 
balances out of numerous unmonitored transactions. The supporting schedules for each 



39 
 

project were not also submitted by the Project personnel and this prevented us from 
verifying the reliability of submitted project financial reports.  
 
36. The Accounting Section disclosed that due to floating amounts and prior year 
negative balances, they had a hard time in the reconciliation of SLs per project. We made 
constant follow-ups of the submission of the GL and SL, but these still remained 
unsubmitted. 

 
37. Further, inquiry with the Accountant revealed that the reconciliation of the SLs of 
the Inter-Agency Payables account was not strictly monitored as the voluminous 
transactions deterred them from the timely preparation of the SLs for each project coupled 
with the lack of  manpower to effectively monitor and maintain the SLs.  Thus, the Notes 
to FS disclosed the questionnable negative balances as shown in Table 5:

38. The non-reconciliation of the GL balance with the SL balances on a periodic basis 
to promptly identify errors and effect the necessary adjustments resulted in the above 
unaccounted and questionable balances. Thus, the Institute failed to furnish us with the 
information needed for the fiscal control of fund transfers received from other government 
agencies, casting doubt on the accuracy and validity of the balances reported in the FS. 
 
39. We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations, with modification,  and 
Management agreed to: 
 

a. Assign/hire additional manpower for the maintenance of SLs/schedules; 
 

b. Maintain/update the SLs for individual projects and tally these with the 
GL; 

 



40 
 

c. Reconcile the inter-agency accounting records and to make adjustments, 
as may be necessary; and 

 
d. Require the Project personnel to submit the financial reports and

40. In summary, due to the significant impact on the financial statements of the total 
misstatements of P20,757,434.80 and P47,551,267.15 which represent 7.07% and 7.69% 
of its total liabilities and equity, respectively, and with total deficiencies of 
P172,909,979.64 or 18.96% of its total assets, we rendered a Qualified Opinion on the 
financial statements of the TAPI as at year-end. 

 
Compliance Audit 
 
Circuitous Fund Transfer 

 

41. Funds Transfers (FTs) received by the TAPI from the Department of Science 
and Technology - Central Office (DOST-CO) for the implementation of the 
Technology Innovation for Commercialization (TECHNICOM) amounting to 
₱49,565,284.01, covering the project duration from January 1 to December 31, 2019, 
and additional funding of ₱15,874,745.42, covering the project duration from 
January 1 to December 31, 2020, were re-transferred by the TAPI to various project 
proponents.  
 
42. COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 provides: 

  
“Section 3.4: Implementing Agency (IA) - The Agency to which the funds are 
transferred for the purpose of prosecuting/implementing the project; and 
 
Section 4.4: The check shall be issued in the name of the IA for deposit to its trust 
account in its authorized government depository bank.  The IA shall issue its official 
receipt in acknowledgment.” 
 

43. Section X, Item C.1.a of DOST AO No. 011, series of 2020 dated September 2, 
2020 also provides for the revised guidelines on the fund releases, among others, that: “The 
Funding Agency (FA) shall release the project funds to the Implementing/Monitoring 
Agencies in partial or full amounts, once DOST has received the signed MOA or conformed 
letter has been signed subject to availability of funds, accounting and auditing regulations, 
and bond requirements (if necessary).” 

 
44. The implementation of various significant projects of the DOST was given to its 
attached agencies by transferring the funds to them covered by a Memorandum of 
Agreement (MOA). These fund transfers were, however, again transferred by the attached 
agencies, as illustrated below: 



41 
 

 
Source Agency (SA) 1st Transfer 2nd Transfer 

Department of Science and 
Technology-Central Office 
(DOST-CO) 

Technology Application 
Promotion Institute (TAPI)  

Other Agencies of the 
Government, Non-
Government Organizations/ 
Civil Society Organizations 
(NGOs/CSOs), Public and 
Private Corporations 

 
45. The flow of funds above is made circuitous for whatever reason that these agencies 
have. The use of these funds could not easily be monitored. The transfers of funds create 
several levels of accountability and responsibility for the funds and projects; thus, making 
it difficult to determine the persons responsible in case of failure to implement the projects. 
Further, Receivable accounts are bloated since the SA and IA both record in their books 
the transfer of funds as Receivables when there is only one and the same amount 
transferred. Having two (2) IAs in the MOA means there are two (2) levels of liquidation 
needed to be accomplished, i.e., that of the Implementing Agency (IA) of the project to the 
Monitoring Agency (MA) of the project, and that of the MA of the project, thru TAPI, to 
the Funding Agency (FA). This practice of multi-layer transfers makes it difficult to 
monitor the use and management of funds, thus, creating confusion on the accountability 
for the amount transferred.  
 
46. A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was entered into between the DOST-CO as 
the FA, the TAPI as the IA, and the Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging 
Technology, Research and Development (PCIEERD) as the MA for the Program: 
“Technology Innovation for Commercialization (TECHNICOM)” with Engr. Edgar I. 
Garcia as the Project Leader. The duration of the project was for one (1) year covering the 
period January 1 to December 31, 2019, with funding of ₱50,000,000.00 chargeable against 
the following:

Total 49,812,936.00 187,064.00 50,000,000.00 

 
47. Subsequently, for CY 2020, TAPI was granted additional funding; and the 
unexpended budget during CY 2019 for the TECHNICOM project extension covering the 
project duration of January 1 to December 31, 2020, with a total funding of ₱16,436,042.96 
chargeable against the following:

48. The DOST-CO’s Project Line-Item Budget for CYs 2019 and 2020 of the 
TECHNICOM Program amounting to ₱44,660,000.00 and ₱9,205,503.29, respectively, 
were allotted for the Grant/Financial Assistance to be released to approved TECHNICOM 
projects. As indicated in the project proposal, TECHNICOM is a form of assistance which 
provides funds for Research and Development (R&D) Projects that are on the last phase of 
technology development and are geared towards market-readiness. Through financial and 
technical assistance, the program aims to fast track the development of R&D outputs into 
mature technologies ready for industry adoption and public utilization.  
 
49. Afterwards, TAPI entered into various MOAs with project proponents for the grant 
of financial assistance where TAPI was referred to as the Implementing Agency of the 
TECHNICOM Program and proponents were referred to as Implementing Agency of the 
Project. As further indicated in the Funding Assistance, the activities, operation of the book 
of accounts, and records of the project shall be subject to reasonable inspection by 
authorized representatives of the FA, thru TAPI, and/or MA. Moreover, the IA of the 
Project shall submit to the MA of the Project all technical and financial reports as mandated 
by the FA, pursuant to applicable rules and regulations. Then, the MA of the project shall 
submit said reports together with their appraisal report to the FA, thru TAPI, within one 
(1) month after the receipt thereof. 
 
50.  To illustrate, a MOA was signed with DOST-CO as the FA, PCIERRD as the MA 
for the Project, TAPI as the IA of the TECHNICOM Program, and Exora Technologies, 
Inc. as the IA of the Project for the implementation of Technology Enhancement and 
Commercialization of Exora Intellex as an Energy Analytics Machine Learning Platform 
for Industrial Energy Smart Management and Electricity Cost Reduction with Engr. Edgar 
I. Garcia as the Project Leader. The duration of the project was for a one-year period, from 
October 14, 2019 to October 13, 2020, with a project fund amounting to ₱4,394,800.00, of 
which P4,277,200.00 was transferred to Exora Intellex and P117,600.00 to PCIEERD. 

 

51. We noted that the above-mentioned functions of the TAPI overlaps with the 
function of the DOST-CO as the FA, and contradicts the MOA provision which states that 
TAPI is referred to as the IA or the primary organization involved in the execution of the 
program/project. Although TAPI was indicated as the IA, having the authority to select the 
projects and to release the fund under the above-mentioned program goes to show that 
TAPI also acts as FA, similar to the function of the DOST-CO. 

 
52. Verification of various fund transfers for implementation of projects under Due 
from NGAs and Other Receivables accounts revealed that TAPI circuitously transfers funds 
received from SAs to various IAs for the projects’ implementation, where TAPI acts as the 
IA of the Program. In this case, for instance, TAPI received from the DOST-CO the fund 
release of ₱49,565,284.01 with Official Receipt (OR) No. 6207369 on April 26, 2019, and 
the additional ₱15,874,745.42 with OR No. 6207453 on March 12, 2020. Subsequently, 
TAPI re-transferred the funds to various IAs of the Project under trust fund for the period

53. The practice of transferring funds from FA to IA then to another IA is not consistent 
with COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 that the amount shall be 
transferred to the IA for the purpose of prosecuting/implementing the project. The funds 
should have been released directly to the IAs of the project, instead of TAPI as IA for its 
implementation of the program and subsequently re-transferring the funds to the IAs for 
the implementation of the project.  

 
54. Ensuring the timely and accurate delivery of output by the IA of the project can be 
done by the SA even if the funds were not released to TAPI as IA of the program. 

 



46 
 

55. The unnecessary second-level transfer of funds may lead to confusion in the project 
implementation and delayed submission of financial/terminal reports to the SA as the fund 
was not transferred directly to the IAs. The Institute informed us that the DOST Office of 
the Undersecretary for Research and Development upholds the decision of Management’s 
release of the project funds to TAPI. Further, the Program Advisory Committee of 
TECHNICOM Program recommended downloading the funds directly to DOST-TAPI 
starting CY 2022 should the results of the Program’s impact assessment turns out 
favorable. 

 
56. Furthermore, the failure to establish a centralized database among the parties and 
the round-about submission of liquidation reports resulted in an accumulated outstanding 
balance of receivables. TAPI accounting records revealed that Due from NGAs, Due from 
NGOs, and Other Receivables accounts still have an aggregate outstanding balance of 
₱92,462,904.20 which represents the funds transferred to proponents sourced from various 
FAs during CY 2018 and prior years The substantial amount of unliquidated balance was 
already a perennial observation that needed to be addressed in accordance with the 
provisions of DOST AO No. 011, series of 2020, dated September 02, 2020, on the 
liquidation of fund transfers. 

 
57. We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 
a. ensure compliance with the provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013 that 

funds for the implementation of the projects be released by the SAs 
directly to the IAs to avoid circuitous transfer of trust funds and to avoid 
discrepancies in the MOA executed for the implementation of the project; 

 
b. stop the circuitous transfer of funds, instead, directly release the funds to 

the actual implementers of the project to avoid overlapping of functions 
and clearly delineate the duties of the DOST and its attached agencies;   

 
c. ensure the timely release of funds to the IAs as it is a critical aspect of 

project implementation and make certain that project objectives are 
achieved and translated into measurable outputs within the set time 
periods; and 

 

d. require the Project personnel to send demand letters to the 
IAs/proponents for the accumulated outstanding balance of receivables 
for transfers during 2018 and prior years, stating definite deadlines and 
the possible blacklisting/legal action that may be instigated against them 
in case of non-compliance to exhaust all possible remedies to compel the 
IAs/proponents to liquidate their long-outstanding balances. 

 
 
 
 



47 
 

Cash Advance Utilization for the National Invention Contest and Exhibits (NICE) 
 
58. The granting and utilization of Cash Advance amounting to ₱1,300,000.00 for 
the reimbursement of Travel Expenses of provincial Finalists in the National 
Invention Contest conducted by TAPI are irregular due to the absence of guidelines 
in the reimbursement of travel expenditures using a rate of percentage, contrary to 
Republic Act No. 7459 and resulting in uncertainty on the propriety and validity of 
payments thereto. 
 
59. The selection for the finalists of National Invention Contest is through a local 
contest at the regional or provincial level where first prize regional winners shall be 
automatically qualified to compete on the national level. The national contest which usually 
conducts its contest proper in the National Capital Region (NCR) could be a limiting factor 
for the participation in the invention contest of the regional winners. In response, TAPI 
provided assistance for the back-and-forth local transportation expenses to the provincial 
contestants. 

 
60. TAPI granted Cash Advance in the total amount of ₱1,300,000.00 and was 
disbursed into two (2) vouchers, particularly in DV No. 2020-02-0107 with Check No. 
843006 dated March 2, 2020 amounting to ₱600,000.00 and in DV No. 2020-02-0108 with 
Check No. 843007 dated March 2, 2020 amounting to ₱700,000.00. The utilization of Cash 
Advances include reimbursement of Travel Expenses to participants under the Outstanding 
Invention Category (Tuklas Award) and Outstanding Creative Research Category (Sibol 
Award for High School and College Levels). 
 
61. Article II titled Cash Rewards of RA 7459, also known as Inventors and Invention 
Incentives Act, states that:  

 
“A round-trip ticket fare in addition to necessary and reasonable expenses but not 
more than Three Hundred Pesos (₱300.00) a day shall be provided to all provincial 
awardees. Upon recommendation of the Screening Committee, all winners may be 
sent by the Philippine Government to other countries where their winning 
inventions or areas of interest are advanced.  
 
The Screening Committee may adjust the cash awards and the additional expenses 
aforecited subject to the approval of the Institute.” 
 

62. Audit of the transactions pertaining to the National Invention Contest and Exhibits 
(NICE) for CY 2020 disclosed that the Institute implemented the prescribed rules and 
regulations of Executive Order (EO) No. 77, series of 2019 dated March 15, 2019 on 
granting additional allowances to the provincial contestants. They applied the per diem rate 
of One Thousand and Five Hundred Pesos up to Two Thousand and Two Hundred Pesos 



48 
 

(₱1,500.00 - ₱2,200.00) a day for the 3-4 days stay of the provincial finalists in the NCR 
during the duration of event.  
 
63. On our inquiry of the EO, which only covers travels of government personnel as 
their basis of the above allowances, Management averred that in the absence of any 
amendment to RA 7459 pertaining to per diem allowance and applying the principle on 
inflation rates, the grant of the said per diem rate would be the most practical application 
for the payment of the travel expenses of the finalists as compared to the allowable rate of 
₱300.00 of RA 7459, which was issued almost three decades ago.   

 
64. The rate of allowance prescribed by the said Act is not without remedy as it stated 
the role of the Screening Committee (SC) to adjust the cash awards and additional expenses 
subject to the approval of the Institute. Hence, the inaction of the Institute’s SC to seek the 
approval of the Head of the agency on the granted per diem allowances different from the 
documented rulings, raised uncertainty on the propriety and validity of payments thereto. 
 
65. We recommended and Management agreed to:  
 

a. Request the Screening Committee to comment/act on the issues raised 
regarding the reimbursement of travel expenses different from the 
allowed amount provided in RA 7459 and adjust them as may be 
necessary; and 

 
b. Observe appropriate control measures on the disbursements of 

government funds and ensure that all payments are in accordance with 
accounting and auditing rules and regulations. 

 
NICE activities lacked supporting documents 
 
66. The payment of necessary expenses to provincial awardees in the 2020 
National Invention Contest amounting to P899,167.36 lacked sufficient supporting 
documents, thus, not in keeping with COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012.  
 
67. The Cash Advance amounting to ₱1,300,000.00 for the reimbursement of Travel 
Expenses of provincial Finalists in the National Invention Contest were liquidated in the 
amount of  ₱899,167.36  in JEV No. 2020-04-0304 dated April 30, 2020 and a refund of 
₱390,000.00 with OR No. 6207455 dated April 15, 2020 and ₱10,832.64 with OR No. 
6207462 dated June 01, 2020. 

 
68.   The payment to provincial awardees of the necessary expenses, such as round-trip 
tickets, allowances and other reasonable expenses, lacked the required documentary 
requirements. TAPI failed to provide the Office Order/Travel Order approved by the Head 
of the Agency in granting the 73 participants their travel expense reimbursements. Audit 



49 
 

of the submitted Liquidation Report on the P899,167.36 revealed that completeness of the 
attached documents was not complied with, in violation of Section 1.2.4.1 of COA Circular 
No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012.  

 
69. The said Office Order stating the approved list of participants and necessary 
information such as their permanent official station, mode of transportation and other 
additional expenses incurred in the reimbursement of travel expenses shall be used as basis 
to ascertain the details and complete submission of documents. 

 
70. The attachments in the Liquidation Report were accounted as Travel Order issued 
by their respective agency/organization/schools, Letter of Invitation, Itinerary of Travel 
approved by TAPI Director, Certificate of Travel Completed, Certificate of Appearance, 
Official Receipts and fare tickets, Justification for the Use of Taxi, OR for Taxi, Statement 
of Account, Boarding Pass, OR for Rental of Van, and Contract for Hiring of Van and other 
documents.  The lacking document varies with each participant and relevant documents 
can be determined accurately if there was an issued Office Order as a guide for the 
applicability of documentary requirements.  

 
71. Management shall ascertain the complete submission of travel documents in future 
transactions as the validity of claims against government funds could not be established 
with the lack of Office Orders/Travel Orders and other travel documentary requirements 
to support it. 
 
72. We recommended and Management agreed to submit the lacking documents 
as prescribed in COA Circular No. 2012-001, and henceforth, adhere to laws, rules 
and regulations on the financial transactions of the Institute. 
 
Honoraria charged to Other Professional Services appropriations 
 
73. Payment of Honoraria amounting to ₱261,773.51 was sourced from the Other 
Professional Services appropriations, contrary to the 2020 GAA provisions.  
Moreover, Honoraria amounting ₱276,773.51 were directly paid to concerned 
government personnel who acted as resource persons and the like, hence, the benefits 
paid may not be in accordance with the 25 percent annual salary threshold and 
taxation purposes. 
 
74. Section 70 of the General Provisions of General Appropriations Act (GAA) for 
Fiscal Year 2020, provides that: 
 

“As a general rule, departments, bureaus and offices of the National 
Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and 
SUCs shall spend what is programmed in their respective appropriations in 
this Act.  In exceptional circumstances, agencies may modify the allotment 



50 
 

issued within an activity or project subject to the approval of the following 
ensued by the timely submission of reports by all offices concerned: 

 
(a) The heads of agencies, for xxx (ii) change in the object of expenditure 

(Travelling Expenses, or Investment Outlays) within an allotment 
class (MOOE, or Capital Outlays);” 

(b) xxx 
(c) xxx 

      (underscoring ours)  
 

75. Verification of disbursement vouchers and obligation requests showed the payment 
of honoraria to Screening Committee, Lecturers, Resource Persons, Coordinators, 
Facilitators, and those who are assigned in Special Projects was taken from the 
appropriations of Other Professional Services without any supporting report of approval 
from the head of agency to modify or change the object of expenditure. Thus, charging of 
honoraria to Other Professional Services not only appeared to be an erroneous 
classification of account, but primarily an error in its source of appropriation.  
 
76. Relatively, government personnel who act as lecturers, resource persons, 
coordinators or facilitators in other government agencies which are outside of their mother 
agencies, may be paid honoraria at such rates as may be determined by the agency 
authorities concerned and shall be entitled to receive honoraria in accordance with the 
guidelines prescribed in DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 dated June 25, 2013 and 
DBM Budget Circular Nos. 2007-1 dated April 23, 2007 and 2007-2 dated October 01, 
2007.  

 
77. In addition, COA Circular No. 76-25-A dated June 30, 1976, Item 3 of the 
Statement of Policies also states that “The total amount of extra or additional compensation 
shall be remitted by the paying office to the collecting officer of the bureau or office of the 
recipient official or employee to be deposited with the National Treasury x x x. X x x.” 

76. Records disclosed that honoraria were directly paid to the concerned government 
personnel and not to their respective mother agencies; thus, the proper monitoring and 
recording of the amount of honoraria received for taxation purposes and the 25 percent 
annual salary threshold may not be undertaken by their mother agency. 
 
78. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Budget Officer to submit a written explanation to COA, with the 
approval of the Head of the agency, on the modification of the object of 
expenditure within the allotment, and henceforth, adhere to the provisions 
on Appropriation and Allotment per GAA; and 
 



51 
 

b. The Accountant and the Cashier to remit the honoraria to the respective 
mother agencies of the government personnel, and to issue the 
corresponding certificates for the taxes withheld and ensure that the 
amount remitted does not exceed the 25 percent annual salary threshold.  

 
Dishonored checks 
 
79. Checks with an aggregate amount of P325,501.60 issued by proponents for the 
repayment of Financial Assistance were dishonored by the drawee bank due to closed 
account or insufficient funds, contrary to Batas Pambansa (BP) Blg. 22. 
 
80. Section 1 of BP Blg. 22 - Checks without sufficient funds - states that, “Any person 
who makes or draws and issues any check to apply on account or for value, knowing at the 
time of issue that he does not have sufficient funds  in or credit with the  drawee  bank  for 
the payment of such check in full upon its presentment, which check is subsequently 
dishonored by the drawee bank for  insufficiency of funds or credit or would have been 
dishonored for the same reason, ordered the bank to stop payment, shall be punished by  
imprisonment  of  not less than thirty  days  but  not more than one (1) year or by a fine of 
not less than but not more than double the amount of the check which fine shall in no case 
exceed Two Hundred Thousand Pesos, or both such fine and imprisonment at the discretion 
of the court.  
 
81. The same penalty shall be imposed upon any person who, having sufficient funds 
in or credit with the drawee bank when he makes or draws and issues a check, shall fail to 
keep sufficient funds or to maintain a credit to cover the full amount of the check if 
presented within a period of ninety (90) days from the date appearing thereon, for which 
reason it is dishonored by the drawee bank. 
 
82. Where the check is drawn by a corporation, company or entity, the person or 
persons who actually signed the check in behalf of such drawer shall be liable under this 
act.” 
 
83. Verification of TAPI’s Other Receivables account as at December 31, 2020, 
includes dishonored checks amounting to P325,501.60 of proponents’ repayments, which 
were returned by the bank due to closed account and deposit against insufficient fund 
(DAIF).  
 
84. Further verification disclosed deficiencies noted in the handling of Dishonored 
Checks as follows: 
 

a. Case was not filed against drawer who failed to settle his/her account or 
deposit the amount sufficient to cover the dishonored check within five (5) days 
from receipt of the Notice of Dishonor. 



52 
 

b. The   registry receipt and the registry return receipt were not attached to the 
Notice of Dishonor kept on file by the Legal/Cashier’s Office. 
 
c.  File copy of the Official Receipt covering the dishonored checks was not 
stamped with the following notation: “Cancelled (date of Notice of Dishonor) per 
Bank Debit/Voucher No. ____ dated ______.” 
 

85. Further, the recurring issuance of post-dated checks by proponents with closed 
accounts or insufficient funds resulted in the incurrence of bank charges and penalties 
imposed by the bank. 
 
86. Management has no specific policy on the handling of Dishonored Checks.  
Nevertheless, the Institute will consider drafting a specific internal control policy on BP 22 
cases. 
 
87. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. File legal action against drawers of Dishonored Checks; 
 
b. Require the Cash/Legal Office to attach a copy of the Registry Receipt and 

the Registry Return Receipt to the Notice of Dishonor, as evidence that the 
drawer was duly notified thru mail;  

 
c. Require the Collecting Officer to stamp the File copy of the Official 

Receipt covering the dishonored checks with the following notation: 
“Cancelled (date of Notice of Dishonor) per Bank Debit/Voucher No. ____ 
dated ______”; and 

 
d. Prepare an internal control policy on the dishonored checks to include 

filing of appropriate charges for violation of B.P. Blg. 22; 
 

Delayed Submission of Financial Reports 
 
88. Delayed submission of DVs, accounting reports and FS with supporting 
schedules and Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) ranging from 1 to 291 days, was 
contrary to the pertinent provisions of Presidential Decree No. 1445, COA Circular 
No. 95-006 and the GAM, Volume I, precluded the timely review/audit of the 
transactions and the prompt communication to Management of the 
recommendations/corrective measures to the audit findings/deficiencies noted. 
 
89. Section 100 of PD 1445 requires the “disbursing officers to render monthly reports 
of their transactions, pursuant to the regulations of the Commission on Audit, to be 



53 
 

submitted not later than the fifth day of the ensuing month to the Auditor concerned who 
shall conduct the necessary examination and audit.” 
 
90. Section 6.05 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 states that the 
“official involved in the daily recording of transactions in the books of accounts shall turn 
over the receipts and the disbursement records with all paid vouchers and documents 
evidencing the transaction to the Auditor within 10 days from the date of receipt of said 
documents.” 

 
91. Section 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I, provides that the “Chief Accountant 
shall submit the Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) with all the supporting documents 
and Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) to the COA Auditor within 20 days after receipt of the 
monthly bank statement.” 
 
92. Section 60, Chapter 19 of the GAM, Volume I, states the submission to the Auditor 
of the monthly trial balances (TBs) and supporting schedules (SSs) shall be within ten (10) 
days after the end of each month while the quarterly TBs, financial statements (FSs) and 
SSs shall be submitted within ten (10) days after the end of each quarter. For year-end 
TBs, FS and SSs, submission to the Auditor is on or before February 14 of the following 
year. 

 
93. Records showed that the submission of Disbursement Vouchers (DVs), accounting 
reports and FS, together with the supporting documents/schedules and BRS for CY 2020, 
were delayed ranging from 1 day to 291 days based on the prescribed timelines, as shown 
in Table 8:

94. The failure of Management to submit these financial documents within the 
prescribed period hindered our timely review/audit of the financial transactions of the 
Agency, hence, the audit/validation of the documents could not be conducted on time and 



54 
 

the results thereof could not be promptly communicated to Management and the correction 
of deficiencies, if any, could not be immediately undertaken. It also precluded the Audit 
Team from timely evaluating the validity of the transactions. 
 
95. The Year-end Trial Balance/FS was submitted within the deadline. However, one 
of the components of the FS, the Notes to the FS, comprising a summary of significant 
accounting policies and other explanatory notes was submitted only on March 23, 2021, 
which hindered the auditorial verification of its financial position and results of its 
operation during the year, and further caused undue delay in the preparation and 
submission of the Annual Audit Report on the Institute. Financial reports are the facts upon 
which responsible fiscal management is based. The prompt submission of the FS, complete 
with their components and supporting schedules, optimizes the usefulness and relevance 
of the information they provide to users.  
 
96. To date, Management still undertakes the manual encoding of all its transactions 
through Excel format resulting in the late submission of required financial reports within 
the time prescribed. The Accounting Section informed us that updating of data is ongoing 
in parallel to the implementation of the electronic-New Government Accounting System 
(e-NGAS). 
 

97. We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations and Management agreed 
to require the Accountant and the Cashier/Disbursing Officer concerned to submit 
all unsubmitted DVs, financial reports and required supporting documents for audit 
and verification within the prescribed period as required under Section 100 of P.D. 
1445 and the pertinent COA regulations. 
 
Deficiencies in Handling of Cash and Cash Accounts 
 
a. Retired Accountable Officer 
 
98. The non-submission of the Final Report of Accountability to the Office of 
the Auditor by the Accountable Officer upon ceasing to act as Regular 
Collecting/Disbursing Officer (RCO/RDO), Special Disbursing Officer (SDO) and 
Petty Cash Fund (PCF) Custodian, was not in consonance with the provisions of 
Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, thus,  resulting in unsettled accountabilities 
hitherto and rendered uncertainty and unreliability of cash accounts of the 
Accountable Officer. 
 
99. Section 77 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 states that “Invoice and receipt 
upon transfer of funds or property. When government funds or property are transferred 
from one accountable officer to another, or from an outgoing officer to his successor, it 
shall be done upon properly itemized invoice and receipt which shall invariably support 



55 
 

the clearance to be issued to the relieved or out-going officer, subject to regulations 
of the Commission.” 
 
100. Section 80 of PD 1445 further states that in the final report of accountable officers: 
 

(1) An accountable officer, upon ceasing to act in his official capacity as such, 
shall submit to the auditor of the agency concerned a report of his 
accountability. 
(2) Any remaining balance of such accountability shall be deposited in the 
proper treasury without unnecessary delay. 

 
101. Upon retirement of the Head of the Cashier Section on July 19, 2020, all functions 
related to her position w a s  performed by the newly designated Officer-In-Charge on 
July 13, 2020, in relation to TAPI Special Order No. 103 Series of 2020 dated July 20, 
2020. However, cash examination showed that the retired Cashier had not complied with 
the proper itemization of invoice and receipt in transferring government funds or property 
to her successor and the corresponding final report of her accountabilities was not 
submitted to the Audit Team to certify the balances in the accounts settled by her. 
 
102. Moreover, the Agency Head failed to take precautionary measures, such as 
appointing a committee to count the cash and take an inventory of the property for which 
the retiring officer was accountable, in order to determine the responsibility for any 
shortage therein. The copy of the inventory and t h e  report of the Committee duly 
certified could have been filed with the Commission, the findings of which shall not be 
conclusive until approved by the Commission or its duly authorized representative. 

 
103. The Institute could have provided the Auditor the supporting documents as proof 
of proper clearance procedures undertaken by Management in relieving the Accountable 
Officer of her accountabilities; thus, the non-submission of the settlement of 
accountability reports or clearance issued to the outgoing officer to the COA Audit Team 
is in contravention of the aforementioned existing laws; and the failure of the agency 
to appoint a committee to conduct cash count and inventory of accounts of AO resulted 
in unaccounted cash balances and assumption of responsibility. The results of audit on 
the accounts of retired Cashier revealed deficiencies as stated in the succeeding paragraphs 
of this audit report. 

 
104. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Document in writing the course of action undertaken when 
accountability of government funds or property are transferred from an 
outgoing officer to his successor; and 
 

b. Adhere to the provisions of PD 1445 on the submission of the Final Report 
of Accountability to the Audit Team, and submit the itemized invoice and 



56 
 

receipt and other documents in support of the clearance issued to the 
relieved or outgoing officer. 

 
105. Sections 12 and 50, Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume I, provide the procedures for 
Disbursements by Checks and through List of Due and Demandable Accounts Payable - 
Advice to Debit Account (LDDAP-ADA). The procedures provided that RCI and RADAI 
shall be prepared daily. All checks issued during the day shall be recorded in the RCI while 
all approved LDDAP-ADA including those not yet delivered to the servicing bank shall be 
included in the RADAI. It will be forwarded to the Accounting Unit together with the 
supporting documents for the preparation of Journal Entry Voucher (JEV). 
 
106. The monthly Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and Report of Advice to Debit 
Account Issued (RADAI) were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor in violation 
of Section 100 of Presidential Decree No. 1445, thus, limiting the Audit Team from 
verifying the validity and accuracy of the cash balances and transactions of the 
Institute. 
 
107. Section 100 of the P.D. No. 1445 on the Reports of disbursing officers in a 
government agency provided that “Disbursing officers in any government agency shall 
render monthly reports of their transactions pursuant to regulations of the Commission 
to be submitted not later than the fifth day of the ensuing month to the auditor 
concerned who shall conduct the necessary examination and audit within thirty days from 
receipt thereof.” 
 
108. As part of the cash examination procedure, the internal control questionnaire was 
administered with the new designated Cashier and disclosed that the preparation of RCI and 
RADAI were prepared daily by the Cashier and forwarded to Accounting Section as the 
basis for the preparation of the Journal Entry Voucher (JEV). However, the submission of 
RCI and RADAI to the Auditor was not observed. The non-submission and non-preparation 
of monthly RCI and RADAI reflecting the total disbursements for the reporting period by 
the Cashier are contrary to Section 100 of PD 1445.  
 
109. The retired AO had not been preparing and submitting the monthly RCI and 
RADAI ever since thinking that the daily reports submitted to the Accounting Section was 
sufficient on the report of accountability. 
 
110. Failure of the retired AO to submit the RCI/RADAI prevented the Audit Team to 
confirm the validity and accuracy of paid disbursement vouchers recorded in the 
submitted accounting reports. The practice employed by the former Cashier resulted 
also in the delay of the submission of disbursements vouchers, thereby precluding the 
timely audit of the transactions.  
 



57 
 

111. Management assured us that the newly designated Cashier will comply with the 
submission of required reports to the Audit Team. Thus, the monthly RCI and RADAI shall 
be prepared to report the summary of all transactions covering all disbursements made 
through checks/ADA during the reporting period. One (1) report shall be prepared for each 
bank account which shall be in complement of the accounting records. 

 
112. We recommended and Management agreed to prepare the Report of Checks 
Issued (RCI) and Report of Advice to Debit Account Issued (RADAI) on a monthly 
basis and submit the daily RCI and RADAI covering the period of the Cash 
Examination conducted. 
 
113. In the Cash Examination, the Auditors shall determine if the AO is properly and 
correctly recording all the cash receipts, remittances/deposits, cash 
advances/disbursements and other entries in the Cashier's appropriate records and that all 
cash balances are reconciled with accounting and related records. 

 
114. Cashbook/cash receipts record (CRR)/check and advices to debit account 
disbursements record (CkADADR)/cash disbursements record (CDR) or their 
equivalent, such as cash receipts register (CRR) for salaries, wages, allowances, etc. 
and for petty operating expenses in accordance with Section 6.2 of COA Circular 
No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, were not maintained by the Accountable 
Officer; thus, the non-monitoring of her accountability and likewise, limiting the 
Audit Team to ascertain the accuracy of the cash balance reflected in the Ledgers 
and the propriety of the transactions. 

 
115. Section 6.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, provides that: 

 
“The AO shall maintain separate cashbooks for salaries, wages, allowances, etc. 
and for petty operating expenses. The AO shall record the transactions in the 
prescribed cashbook daily. He may record each invoice/ receipt/voucher 
individually or the total disbursements for the day depending on the volume of the 
transactions.” 

 
116. During the cash examination, we noted that only the petty cash fund records of the 
former AO/Cashier were presented. It was revealed that the former Cashier practiced 
manual recording of daily cash collections and deposits, and did not maintain the prescribed 
records. The determination of the cash transactions and records relied heavily on the 
submitted Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) of the Accounting Section, which contravened the 
objective of the cash examination to validate the accuracy of the cash balance reflected in 
the Cashier’s records with the ledgers; thus, the failure, therefore, of maintaining said reports 
was an indication that the AO did not monitor the account balances under her custody. 
 
117. Moreover, non-conformance with the prescribed procedures in recording the 
accountabilities hindered us from determining whether all monies received had been 



58 
 

correctly recorded and fully accounted for in accordance with laws, rules and regulations 
and to ascertain whether disbursements were valid, duly authorized, actually paid and 
properly recorded. 
 
118. We recommended and Management agreed to prepare and submit the 
separate cashbook/CRR/CDR/CkDR or their equivalent for each accountability 
covering the period of the Cash Examination. 
 
119. The Disbursing Officer is required to submit the Monthly Reports of Accountability 
for Accountable Forms where the beginning balance, receipt, issuance and ending balance 
of the accountable forms under her custody are indicated. 
 
120. The submitted Monthly Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms 
(RAAF) during the period from September 2018 to February 2020 failed to account 
for the three (3) issued checks under the agency’s LBP Current Account - Special 
Projects, contravening Section 111 (2) of Presidential Decree No. 1445, which cast 
doubt on the validity of the transactions and the reliability of the reports. 

 
121. Section 111 of Presidential Decree No. 1445, the keeping of accounts states: 

 
“xxx 
(2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be 
observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading 
information.” 
 

122. Validation of the submitted Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms 
(RAAF) disclosed that the reports on the agency’s LBP Current Account-Special Projects 
were not reliable due to omissions of the issued check numbers 523112 to 523114 in the 
reports for the period from September 2018 to February 2020. The details are presented in 
Tables 9 and 10:

123. The non-recording of the issued checks in the RAAF for a significant period of 
time resulted in the doubtful reliability of reports and contradicts the provision of Section 
111 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 in t h e  keeping of accounts. The inaccuracies in 
the reports imply that the Accountable Officer has insufficient measures of itemization of 
accountable forms that are unable to determine the deficiency in reports. 
 
124. Management commented that due to seldom usage of the checks in the LBP Current 
Account - Special Projects, the former Cashier inadvertently omitted the issued checks in 
the RAAF. The newly designated Cashier shall observe due diligence in reporting the 
accountabilities under her custody. 

 
125. We recommended and Management agreed to submit the modified RAAF on 
the LBP Current Account - Special Projects covering the period from September 2018 
to February 2020, and substantiate the validity of the transactions and observe 
diligence in the preparation of reports. 
 
126. TAPI, in cooperation with the DOST Regional Offices, conducted the Regional 
Invention Contest and Exhibits (RICE) from different regions of the country. The biennial 
invention contest was held for the pre-screening phase and selection of winners that will 
be competing in a higher level during the NICE event. In view of this, the first prize 
regional winner on each category shall automatically be a national qualifier for the national 
contest. TAPI officers are, therefore, assigned to facilitate the implementation of the 2019 
RICE. 
 
127. The Accountable Officer exceeded her authority in the use of cash advance 
(CA) by P363,000.00 or 129 percent above the authorized amount of her CA of 
P282,000.00 to defray the cash awards for the 2019 Regional Invention Contest and 
Exhibits, pursuant to TAPI Special Order No. 361 series of 2019, sans new special 
orders for  the  additional  advances,  which  are  in  violation  o f   Section  89  of  
Presidential Decree No. 1445 and considered as irregular  expenditures under COA 
Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012. 
 
128. Section 89 of PD 1445 on limitations on cash advance provides that: 
 

“No cash advance shall be given unless for a legally authorized specific purpose. 
A cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for 
which it was given has been served. No additional cash advance shall be allowed 
to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first 
settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.” 
 

129. Pursuant to TAPI Special Order No. 361 Series of 2019 dated September 26, 
2019, the Accountable Officer was authorized to hold cash advance amounting to 
P282,000.00 to defray t h e  Cash Awards in 2019 RICE at NCR, CALABARZON and 



60 
 

Region III. The disbursement of CA was made through DV No. 2019-09-0811, with check 
number 839884, dated September 26, 2019.

131. Following the above computation vis-à-vis the authorized CA for the AO/SDO, 
there was an unauthorized disbursement of P363,000.00 or 129 percent 
(P363,000.00/282,000.00) above the authorized amount, i.e., without covering special 
orders, contrary to the above-cited Section 89 of PD 1445 and seemed to be an  
irregular expenditure  under COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012  on the 
Updated Guidelines for the Prevention and Disallowance of Irregular, Unnecessary, 
Excessive, Extravagant and Unconscionable (IUEEU) Expenditures, which is defined as 
follows: 

 
“The term "irregular expenditure" signifies an expenditure incurred without 
adhering to established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, 
principles or practices that have gained recognition in laws. Irregular 
expenditures are incurred if funds are disbursed without conforming with 
prescribed usages and rules of discipline. There is no observance of an 
established pattern, course, mode of action, behavior, or conduct in the 
incurrence of an irregular expenditure. A transaction conducted in a manner that 
deviates or departs from, or which does not comply with standards set is deemed 
irregular. A transaction which fails to follow or violates appropriate rules of 
procedure is, likewise, irregular.” 

 



61 
 

132. The replenishment of cash advance made by the SDO is considered to be an 
irregular expenditure as it was disbursed without conforming to prescribed guidelines in 
the grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances and in the absence of special orders 
or authority to disburse. 
 
133. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Submit i t s  justification and t h e  supporting documents on the use of 
Cash Advance (CA) in contravention of the grant and utilization of CA 
as stated in Section 89 of Presidential Decree No. 1445, and why it should 
not be disallowed in audit; and 

 
b. Observe appropriate control measures in the disbursement of 

government funds. 
 

b. New Designated Cashier 
 
134. The newly designated Head of the Cashier Section, who is both the Regular 
Disbursing Officer and Collecting Officer: (a) was not bonded, contrary to Section 
101 of PD 1445, Sections 4.1and 4.3 of the Bureau of the Treasury Circular No. 02-
2009 dated August 06, 2009, and Section 7.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated 
February 10, 1997; and (b) does not maintain a cashbook, in violation of the 
provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. 
 
135. On the accountability and responsibility for government funds and property, 
Section 101 of PD 1445, otherwise known as the State Audit Code of the Philippines, 
provides that: 
 

"(1) Every officer of any government agency whose duties permit or require the 
possession or custody of government funds or property shall be accountable 
therefor and for the safekeeping thereof in conformity with law. (2) Every 
accountable officer shall be properly bonded in accordance with law.” 

 
136. While Sections 4.1 and 4.3 of the Bureau of the Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 
dated August 06, 2009, also known as the Revised Omnibus Regulations Governing the 
Fidelity Bonding of Accountable Public Officers states: 
 

“4.1 Public Officers Covered - Every officer, agent, and employee of the 
Government of the Philippines or of the companies or corporations of which the 
majority of the stock is held by the National Government (NG), regardless of the 
status of their appointment shall, whenever the nature of the duties performed by 
such officer, agent or employee permits or requires the possession , custody or 
control of funds or properties for which he is accountable , be deemed a bondable 



62 
 

officer and shall be bonded or bondable and his fidelity insured (Sections 314 & 
318, PBL). 
 
4.3 Others Covered: 
 

4.3.1 Accountable public officers discharging their duties in a foreign 
country. 
4.3.2 Public officers accountable to others who are primarily accountable 
4.3.3 Public officers designated as authorized signatories and counter 
signatories in the issuance of checks and approval of disbursement 
vouchers. 
4.3.4 Heads of departments, bureaus, agencies and instrumentalities of 
the Government” 

 
137. Relatedly, Section 7. 1 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, as 
amended by COA Circular No. 2006-005 dated July 13, 2006, requires that "Each 
accountable officer whose total cash accountability is not less than P5,000 shall be 
bonded." 
 
138. On July 20, 2020, under TAPI Special Order No. 103, series of 2020 dated July 9, 
2020, a new AO was designated as the Officer-In-Charge (OIC) of the Cash Section in 
view of the retirement of the former Cashier Head on July 19, 2020. As an Officer-in-
Charge, she will perform all functions related to the position of the Administrative Officer 
V - Cashier Section and she is authorized to sign the following: 
 

1. LDDAP-ADA 
2. Checks Issued 
3. PACSVAL/Financial Data Entry System 
4. Advice of Checks Issued and Cancelled 
5. Official Receipts Issued 
6. Monthly Reports 

  
139. With the promotion of this new AO on September 09, 2020, she formally assumed 
as the Head of the Cash Section. During the cash examination conducted on November 10, 
2020, however, it was disclosed that she was not yet bonded. As such, the above-mentioned 
functions 1-4 were being performed by the Chief of Finance and Administrative Division. 
Although verification revealed that she has properly filled out General Form 57 (A) 
(Revised March 24, 1976) or the Request for Bonding and/or Cancellation of Bond of 
Accountable Officials and Employees of the Republic of the Philippines, nonetheless, she 
failed to file them with the Bureau of the Treasury. 
 
140. Hence, as she had no bond, she could not properly and fully discharge the duties 
and functions required of her as a Cashier. 



63 
 

141. Furthermore, Cashbooks were not maintained by the AOs, contrary to the 
provisions of Section 6 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 on the 
handling, custody and disposition of the cashbook which states that: 
 

6.1 "A newly-appointed or designated AO shall start with a new cashbook. 
Before discharging his duties, the new AO shall be briefed by the Accountant and 
the Auditor on the proper recording of the transactions and other matters related 
to his work; 
 
6.2 The AO shall maintain separate cashbooks for salaries, wages, allowances, 
etc. and for petty operating expenses. The AO shall record the transactions in the 
prescribed cashbook daily. He may record each invoice/receipt/voucher 
individually or the total disbursements for the day depending on the volume of the 
transactions; and 
 
6.3 When the AO ceases to be one, the cashbook shall be submitted to the 
Accountant or the Treasurer (for local government units) and shall form part of the 
accounting records. No clearance shall be issued to an AO if he fails to submit the 
cashbook as required." 

 
142. During cash examination, it was revealed that the Cashier failed to maintain the 
Cashbook as Regular Disbursing Officer and Regular Collecting Officer, to record the daily 
transactions as required under COA Circular No. 97-002. 
 
143. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Cashier to: (a) post 
the required bond, pursuant to Section 101(2) of PD 1445 and Treasury Circular No. 
02-2009 dated August 6, 2009, and (b) maintain a cashbook, pursuant to Section 6 of 
COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. 
 
Other Mandatory Compliance Audit 
 
Gender and Development (GAD) 
 
144. The extent of accomplishments in relation to planned FY 2020 GAD activities 
and targets cannot be assessed due to non-submission of the approved GAD Plan and 
Budget from the   Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) and delayed submission 
of Management of its GAD Accomplishment Report to the Audit Team contrary to 
Guideline V of COA Circular No. 2014-001, which hindered the prompt discharge of 
audit function. The 2020 GAD Plan and Budget and GAD Accomplishment Report is 
still under review by the PCW. 
 
145. Guideline V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014, provides that 
the Audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the 
COA Audit Team (AT) assigned to the agency within five (5) working days from the 



64 
 

receipt of the approved plan from the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) while a 
copy of the corresponding Accomplishment Report (AR) shall be furnished the AT within 
five (5) working days from the end of January of the preceding year. 
 
146. PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 2021, on the 
submission of FY 2020 GAD AR, sets the deadline for agencies under the executive 
department for encoding and submission to PCW of FY 2020 GAD AR on or before March 
12, 2021. 

 
147. Section 31 of the General Provisions of 2020 General Appropriations Act (GAA) 
or RA 11465 mandates that the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 
agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets.  
 
148. The GAD Plan is required to be integrated in the regular activities of the concerned 
government agency, which shall be at least 5 percent of the total budget allocation. 
 
149. Based on a copy of the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) furnished to us by 
Management, a total of P31,418,500.00 or 23.34 percent of its total appropriations of 
P134,585,000.00 for CY 2020 was allotted for the implementation of GAD 
activities/program in compliance with Section 31 of RA 11465.  
  
150. However, inquiry on the status of approved FY 2020 Annual GPB submitted to the 
PCW disclosed that TAPI’s 2020 GPB is still being reviewed by PCW. Moreover,  
Management commented that the submitted FY 2020 GAD AR to the AT on April 13, 
2020 was submitted through Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) and is 
still under review and evaluation of the PCW. Thus, the extent of accomplishments in 
relation to planned GAD activities and targets cannot be assessed.  
 
151. Management’s lapses for non-submission of the required GAD AR does not 
facilitate the audit of the utilization of the GAD budget which is to be evaluated based on 
the GAD performance indicators identified in the said PCW-endorsed GPB and GAD AR. 

 
152. We recommended and Management agreed to follow up the approved FY 2020 
GAD Plan and Budget and the GAD Accomplishment Report to PCW. Henceforth, 
ensure the timely submission of all GAD required reports. 
 
Senior Citizens and the Differently-Abled Persons 
 
153. The Institute has implemented projects and activities formulated for CY 2020 
that addressed the needs of senior citizens and differently-abled persons, consistent 
with Section 32 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) 
for FY 2020 or RA 11465. 
 



65 
 

154. Section 32 of Republic Act 11465 or the GAA of 2020 provides that “All agencies 
of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the 
concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it related to their 
mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities. Moreover, all 
government facilities, including infrastructure, non-infrastructure and civil works projects 
of the government, as well as office buildings, streets and highways shall provide 
architectural facilities or structural features, designs, or facilities that will reasonably 
enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability, pursuant to Batas 
Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA No.  7277, as amended.” 
 
155. The Institute attributed Programs wherein four (4) senior citizens were given 
assistance in the filing of Intellectual Property Rights, and one (1) senior citizen in the 
National Invention Contest. 
 
156. We recommended and Management agreed to continue its efforts in adhering 
to the General Provisions of the GAA by formulating and implementing plans and 
programs intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and differently-abled 
Persons.  
 
Youth Development 

 
157. In CY 2020, the Institute conducted DOST-Academe Program Technology-Base 
Enterprise Development (DATBED) Program orientations/meetings in selected academic 
institutions and DOST Regional Offices using online platforms to conform to the new 
normal.  
 
158. The Program developed entrepreneurial competencies among students and 
supported five (5) income generating projects with technological innovation benefitting 23 
students from the Cagayan State University (CSU) – Gonzaga with funding assistance 
amounting to P640,100.00. 
 
159. The Invent School Program (ISP) was able to conduct its very first "Invent School 
Webinar Edition" conforming to the new normal. The Institute was able to successfully 
conduct online trainings and workshops to 450 high school and college students from 
various schools and colleges/universities in different regions. 
 
160. We recommended and Management agreed to continuously conduct 
programs/activities related to youth development. 

 

Compliance with Property Insurance Law    
     
161. The Institute has insured all their insurable property, assets, and interest with the 
General Insurance Fund (GIF) administered by the Government Service Insurance System 
(GSIS) amounting to ₱111,844.72 under various Official Receipts, having an insurance 



66 
 

period of one (1) year. The effectivity dates covering May 1, 2020 to November 1, 2020 
are expiring by May 1, 2021 to November 1, 2021, under various insurance policies. 
 
Hiring of Contract of Service/Job Orders (COS/JOs) 
 
162. In CY 2020, the Technology Application and Promotion Institute had 69 Contract 
of Service/Job Orders (COS/JOs) personnel to augment its regular workforce consisting of 
65 plantilla employees. These COS/JOs were assigned to different divisions of TAPI: 
nineteen (19) were assigned at Technical Information and Promotion Division (TIPD),

amount of ₱5,908,325.08 was sourced from the General Fund and ₱21,845,507.27 from 
Trust Fund, and recorded in the Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) as 
Other Professional Services.

163. The Institute’s compliance with laws, rules and regulations on the deduction and 
remittance of taxes, GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth premiums, as well as the deficiencies 
noted in the analysis of affected accounts, are shown in Table 12:

167. Follow-up collection or demand letters may be sent or other strategies may be 
considered on how Management can collect from the said persons liable. Management 
should be mindful of the solidary nature of the disallowance and that the liability of those 
retired/separated employees who fail/refuse to settle their liability as well as those already 
deceased, may be charged against other persons held solidarily liable, specifically the 
approving/certifying officials. 
 
168. We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 
a. enforce the settlement of the audit suspensions and disallowances in 

accordance with Section 7 of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on Settlement 
of Accounts (RRSA); and 

 
b. exert all efforts to collect from the persons liable who are no longer
