A)	Scope of Audit



The audit covered the accounts and operations of the HRep for CY 2020. The audit was conducted to: a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements; b) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; c) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations; and d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.



B)	Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements

	

	The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the HRep’s financial statements.



C)	Audit Observations and Recommendations



         The following are the significant observations and recommendations which are discussed in detail in Part II of this report:



1)	Thirty pieces of works of art of national artists of undetermined value and a 3-panel mural painting amounting to P600,000.00 remain unrecorded in the books of accounts, resulting in the understatement of the Works of Arts and Archeological Specimens and Accumulated Surplus accounts, respectively. (Paragraph No. 1)

     

We recommended that Management:



a)	Require the Property officer to exert efforts to locate all pertinent documents such as proof of acquisition or deed of donations to support ownership and basis to take up initial cost in the books pursuant to Section 30(b), Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I; 



b)	Require the Accountant to create a Registry of Heritage Assets (RHA) for assets not yet recognized in the books and for the Property Officer to issue the appropriate Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) to end-users, pursuant to Section 30(d), Chapter 10 of GAM, Volume I;



c)	Expedite the signing/acceptance of the Deed of Donation from NCCA; and



d)	Require the Accountant to adjust the Works of Arts and Archeological Specimens and Accumulated Surplus accounts by ₱600,000.00, upon signing of the Deed of Donation to reflect the accurate cost of the mural paintings.



1)	Financial and other related documents/reports including their supporting documents and Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs) were not submitted to the COA Auditor’s Office within the deadlines set by applicable existing auditing rules and regulations which precluded the timely audit and analysis of the accounts and transactions of HRep for CY 2020. (Paragraph No. 2)



We reiterated our previous year’s audit recommendation that the Accountant and Budget Officer promptly comply with the prescribed deadlines for the timely submission of various financial and budgetary accountability reports, respectively, pursuant to applicable rules and regulations thereon.



2)	The establishment of a GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) as required by Section 36 (b) of RA 9710, otherwise known as the Magna Carta for Women, was not implemented by the House, thereby the intent and purpose of the legislation to catalyse and accelerate gender mainstreaming within the agency was not attained and depriving the intended beneficiaries of the programs that will address gender issues within their concerned sectors. (Paragraph No. 3)



We reiterated our previous year’s recommendation for Management to comply with the pertinent provisions of RA 9710 on the creation of the GFPS and formulation of the agency-wide GPB with a budget of at least five percent of the HREP’s total appropriation as provided for in the GAA, as well as the preparation and submission of the corresponding accomplishment report as set forth in the policy guidelines of Joint Circular No. 2012-01 of the Department of Budget and Management, National Economic Development Authority, and Philippine Commission on Women.



The above observations and recommendations contained in the report were discussed with the concerned officials of the HRep during the exit conference held on May 31, 2021.   Management comments were considered in the report, where appropriate.     



D)	Status of E Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges



For CY 2020, no Notice of Suspension, Notice of Disallowance, and Notice of Charge was issued. 



E)	Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations



	Of the five prior years’ audit recommendations, two were implemented while three were not implemented.
