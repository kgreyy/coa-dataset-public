FINANCIAL ISSUES



Unrecorded Works of Arts and Archeological Specimens



1)	Thirty pieces of works of art of national artists of undetermined value and a 3-panel mural painting amounting to P600,000.00 remain unrecorded in the books of accounts, resulting in the understatement of the Works of Arts and Archeological Specimens and Accumulated Surplus accounts, respectively.



	1)	Section 30, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I, for the National Government Agencies (NGAs), provides:



“Sec. 30. Heritage Assets. Heritage assets are those assets which have historical, cultural and environmental significance, and are intended to be preserved in trust for future generations. Examples of heritage assets include historical buildings and monuments, statues, museum and gallery collections, archaeological sites, national archives, ruins, conservation areas, nature reserves, and works of art. 



x x x



a)	Heritage assets shall be measured at cost. If acquired through non-exchange transaction, its cost is its fair value at the date of acquisition. Depreciation shall not be recognized but these shall be subject to impairment. Fair value, if measurable, shall be disclosed. 



x x x



a)	For accountability purposes, a Registry of Heritage Assets (RHA) (Appendix 72) shall be maintained for heritage assets not recognized in the books of accounts, by the Accounting Division/Unit and appropriate PAR shall be issued to enduser/accountable officer. At the end of each month, the total amount shall be posted in the Registry of Heritage Asset-Summary (RHAS) (Appendix 72A).” (emphasis supplied)



	2)	While, Section 21, Chapter 5 of GAM, Volume I for NGAs, states,



“Sec. 21. Recognition of Asset through Transfers. An entity shall recognize an asset in respect of transfers when the transferred resources meet the definition of an asset and satisfy the criteria for recognition as an asset. (Par. 76, IPSAS 23)

a)	Transfers meet the definition of an asset when the entity controls the resources as a result of a past event (the transfer) and expects to receive future economic benefits or service potential from those resources. Transfers satisfy the criteria for recognition as an asset when it is probable that the inflow of resources will occur, and their fair value can be reliably measured. xxx” (emphasis supplied)



	3)	As at December 31, 2020, the Work of Arts and Archeological Specimens account has a balance of P1,200,000.00. Our analysis of said account revealed the following:



a)	Thirty pieces of works of art of national artists of undetermined value are currently displayed at the Speaker’s Hallway Gallery of National Artists in the House of Representatives.



	4)	Inquiry with accounting and property personnel disclosed that these works of art were recently discovered to be in HRep’s safekeeping but were not included in the December 31, 2020 Inventory Report. Several pieces were initially determined as donated to HRep long ago, with no clear provenance or copy of deeds of donation. The details of these works of art are shown below:

	5)	It bears emphasis that these items are of significant heritage value since all were done by national artists such that its ultimate value may not be reflected in any financial valuation or estimate if it only considers market prices to date. This notwithstanding, the cost for which it was bought or value when received as donation should be determined to serve as basis for taking it up in the books. The continued non-recognition of the cost of these works of art has clearly understated the Works of Arts and Archaeological Specimens and Accumulated Surplus accounts for CY 2020. While their cost is being determined, these assets should be properly safeguarded and fully accounted for by property and accounting personnel.









	6)	We recommended that Management require the –



a)		Property officer to exert efforts to locate all pertinent documents such as proof of acquisition or deed of donations to support ownership and basis to take up initial cost in the books pursuant to Section 30(b), Chapter 10 of GAM, Vol. I; and



b)		Accountant to create a Registry of Heritage Assets (RHA) for assets not yet recognized in the books and for the Property Officer to issue the appropriate Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) to end-users, pursuant to Section 30(d), Chapter 10 of GAM, Vol. I.

 

	7)	Management explained that it recognizes the necessity to have these assets properly monitored, maintained and recorded in the books. Thus, Management has coordinated and issued the appropriate instructions to the concerned property officers/s and other personnel possessing knowledge relevant to the determination of the asset valuation. Management committed to update COA on its progress on the matter soonest.



	8)	Management also informed that the Chief Accountant will be preparing the required RHA in compliance with the COA recommendation.



	9)	Lastly, Management mentioned that should diligent efforts fail to yield the sought records and documents that are sufficient to substantiate and arrive at a proper valuation of the works of arts, the current House leadership will seek the assistance of the National Museum to appraise or determine the current market value of the assets, which will be used as the basis for recognition in the books.



b)	Unrecorded cost of a 3-panel mural painting amounting to ₱600,000.00 representing financial assistance from the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) to HRep as part of the Arts in Public Spaces project.



	10)	A collaborative project between NCCA and HREP entitled, “Arts in Public Spaces – Batasang Pambansa” as evidenced by a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) dated May 24, 2016, specifies under Part II thereof the following:



“A. The NCCA shall:



1)	Appropriate the sum of SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (Php600,000.00) as financial assistance to the HREP;



x x x 



B.   For its part, the HREP shall:



1)	Appropriate the sum of TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (Php200,000.00) as counterpart funding in the implementation of the project.  x x x;” (emphasis supplied)



	11)	The mural paintings depicting the history of the House of Representatives and created by Filipino artists commissioned by the NCCA was completed in CY 2017 and is presently located at the main lobby of the HRep Legislative Library, Archives and Museum Building.



	12)	Review of the supporting documents revealed that only the counterpart fund transferred to NCCA in the amount of P200,000.00 was entered in the books in CY 2017, while the P600,000.00 financial assistance from NCCA remained unrecognized/unrecorded. Management explained that the reason for the non-recognition of the P600,000.00 financial assistance is because HRep has yet to sign/accept the Deed of Donation from the NCCA.



	13)	Simply, the continued non-recognition of the financial assistance from NCCA as part of its collaboration with HRep to finish the mural paintings project again understated the Works of Arts and Archaeological Specimens and Accumulated Surplus accounts by P600,000.00 for CY 2020.



	14)	We recommended that Management:



a)	Expedite the signing/acceptance of the Deed of Donation from NCCA; and



b)	Require the Accountant to adjust the Works of Arts and Archeological Specimens and Accumulated Surplus accounts by ₱600,000.00, upon signing of the Deed of Donation to reflect the accurate cost of the mural paintings.



	15)	Management informed that follow-ups will be made with the Office of the Speaker for the immediate accomplishment of the Deed of Donation to serve as basis for the required adjusting entries in the books to reflect the correct balances of the affected accounts.





Submission of Financial and Budgetary Reports and Documents



2)	Financial and other related documents/reports including their supporting documents and Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs) were not submitted to the COA Auditor’s Office within the deadlines set by applicable existing auditing rules and regulations which precluded the timely audit and analysis of the accounts and transactions of HRep for CY 2020.

	a)	Delayed submission of financial and other related documents/reports including their supporting documents



	1)	Section 7.2.1 (a) of COA Circular No. 2009-06 dated September 15, 2009 provides that the Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions shall ensure that the reports and supporting documents submitted by the Accountable Officers (AOs) are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month.



	2)	While, Section 60, Chapter 19 of the GAM, Volume 1, provides that all National Government Agencies shall prepare and submit the following financial statements and supporting schedules within the prescribed deadlines as follows:

	3)	Section 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM Volume 1, states that the Chief Accountant shall submit the Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) within twenty (20) days after receipt of the Bank Statement to the COA Auditor.



	4)	Section 122 of PD 1445 provides, among others, that whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the Commission may, under regulations issued by it, require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory report, current plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions.



	5)	In CY 2020, our review of Management’s compliance with the prescribed period for the submission of financial reports and other related documents/records such as bank reconciliation statements, official receipts, journal entry vouchers, disbursement vouchers and other reports disclosed delays as follows:



Report

Number of Days Delayed

Bank Reconciliation Statements 

1-147

Trial Balance

63-225

Journal Entry Vouchers

63-232

Disbursement Vouchers (DVs)

26-274



	6)	The submission of reports beyond deadlines set by regulations hindered access to vital information that are necessary for Management and other stakeholders to make timely decisions pertaining to, among others, the administration of their affairs and performance of their mandates.  It also had impacts on the ability of oversight agencies to effectively discharge their duties and functions and in the case of COA, the delays limited the application of appropriate audit procedures on the analysis of relevant accounts and transaction for the year.



	b)	Delayed submission of Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs)



	7)	Section 91 of the General Provisions (Financial and Physical Reports) of RA 11465 or the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020 requires that government agencies regularly submit accountability reports to among others, the COA and DBM, to enable them as oversight agencies to effectively report, monitor and/or evaluate agency performance as basis for sound policy decisions in a timely manner.



	8)	While, COA-DBM Joint Circular (JC) No. 2019-1 dated January 1, 2019 revised the submission deadlines and modified report formats earlier set by COA-DBM JC No. 2014-1 dated July 2, 2014 to fine-tune the presentation of data with the cash-based appropriations starting FY 2019.



2.9	Section 4.3 of JC No. 2019-1 requires that within 30 days after the end of each quarter, the following should be submitted to both COA and the DBM, to wit:



--	Budget Accountability Report No. 1

--	Financial Accountability Report (FAR) No. 1

--	FAR No. 1-A

--	FAR No. 1-B

--	FAR No. 2

--	FAR No. 2-A

--	FAR No. 5



2.10 	Further, submission of FAR No. 3 and FAR No. 4 should be made on or before the 30th day following the end of the year and 10th day of the month following the last month of the covered reporting period, respectively.



2.11	Our verification of compliance with report submissions for FY 2020 disclosed that no BFAR reports were submitted to the COA Auditor’s Office neither at the House nor at the Government Accountancy Sector for the 1st to 3rd Quarter of FY 2020.  We inquired from Management as to the reason for non-preparation/submission of the BFARs in accordance with DBM and COA requirements and were informed that the current pandemic situation has greatly affected their capacity to comply.  However, Management was able to submit the BFAR for CY 2020 with the noted understandable delay.



2.12	We recognize the limitations brought about by the current pandemic causing inevitable delays in the compliance with existing rules and regulations. However, we emphasize that the timely submission of the above-mentioned reports or the non-submission thereof impacts making informed policy decisions which aims to benefit the bureaucracy moving forward. Thus, we continue to remind  Management to exert extra effort to comply, as mandated by existing regulations.



2.13	In view of the foregoing, we reiterate our previous year’s audit recommendation that the Accountant and Budget Officer promptly comply with the prescribed deadlines for the timely submission of various financial and budgetary accountability reports, respectively, pursuant to applicable rules and regulations thereon.



2.14	Management explained that the unprecedented and reeling effects of the COVID pandemic have hit HRep hard most especially the Finance Department which caused a number of work disruptions during CY 2020. The effects of the lockdown, key personnel contracting COVID-19 and other health-related problems impeded and constrained the office to promptly meet the prescribed deadlines of the required reports. Despite this, Management committed to strive to comply with its reportorial responsibilities by taking apt measures with concerned personnel to shorten the delays and improving on meeting the deadlines due this current year.   





OTHER COMPLIANCE ISSUES



Gender and Development (GAD)



3)	The establishment of a GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) as required by Section 36 (b) of RA 9710, otherwise known as the Magna Carta for Women, was not implemented by the House, thereby the intent and purpose of the legislation to catalyse and accelerate gender mainstreaming within the agency was not attained and depriving the intended beneficiaries of the programs that will address gender issues within their concerned sectors.



	1)	Section 36 (b) of RA 9710 mandates the creation/strengthening of the GFPS in all departments, including their attached agencies, offices, bureaus, state universities and colleges, government-owned and controlled corporations, local government units, and other government instrumentalities to catalyze and accelerate gender mainstreaming within the agency or local government unit.



	2)	Further, Section 31 of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020 provides that “All agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta for Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).”



	3)	These provisions require the establishment of a GFPS which shall be responsible for the planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluation of gender-related activities within the core mandate and operations of the agency.  Since no GFPS was established, no GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) was formulated and no gender-related programs were implemented during the year.  Thus, the purpose and intent of RA 9710 were not fulfilled by the agency.



	4)	While we acknowledge the limitations caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts made by Management in trying to formulate GAD programs and projects for CY 2020, the same will have to be revisited to allow compliance with pertinent provisions of prevailing laws and regulations that will eventually lead to the full utilization of available funds for the implementation of GAD programs and projects.



	5)	We reiterate our previous year’s recommendation for Management to comply with the pertinent provisions of RA 9710 on the creation of the GFPS and formulation of the agency-wide GPB with a budget of at least five percent of the HREP’s total appropriation as provided for in the GAA, as well as the preparation and submission of the corresponding accomplishment report as set forth in the policy guidelines of Joint Circular No. 2012-01 of the Department of Budget and Management, National Economic Development Authority, and Philippine Commission on Women.



	6)	Management informed that it recognizes its responsibility under existing GAD laws and regulations. Over the years, earnest efforts were made for the creation of a GFPS and to formulate GAD programs and projects since funding is available for said activities. However, with the constant change in the House leadership exacerbated by the pandemic, personnel who should focus on GAD-related activities also found themselves occupied with other responsibilities equally important. That said, HRep undertakes, hereinafter, to take initial positive acts geared towards compliance with its legal obligation. 





Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability



4)	Section 31 of the RA 11465 or the General Appropriations Act for FY 2020 requires, among others, that all agencies of the government formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens (SCs) and persons with disability (PWDs), insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.



	1)	Structures focused towards the improvement and/or enhancement of the mobility, safety and welfare of both SCs and PWDs are provided and maintained within the House complex.  The completed ramps at the entrances of all buildings, i.e. North Wing, South Wing, South Wing Annex, Ramon V. Mitra Building, among others, are continuously maintained to ensure easy access for persons using wheelchairs.  At the second floor, there are several ramps, one of which is located on the way to the Office of the Speaker.  Even paths going to automated teller machines are equipped with ramps.   Moreover, elevators and reserved parking spaces within the buildings are marked as reserved for vehicles of SCs and PWDs.



	2)	A non-profit organization of PWDs called Empowering People with Disabilities, Inc., exists in the House.  It is composed of officials and employees who are differently-abled.  Among its objectives are:



a)	to promote the creation of a barrier-free environment through legislation and advocacy;

b)	to promote inclusive development and a society for all through building a network of legislative employees with disabilities nationwide; and

c)	to conduct information dissemination, and educate and campaign to empower personnel with disabilities about their rights as the pillars of the society by which they can level off the playing field.



	3)	For CY 2020, the programs of the House of Representatives focused more on the proper maintenance of existing structures for senior citizens and PWDs since no new major structure or ground work was scheduled for the year.  We were able to validate that elevators were kept in good operational condition through periodic maintenance checks, and markings for areas reserved for the use of PWDs were kept tidy and clearly visible.





GSIS Property Insurance Law (RA 656)



5)	The House has insured its properties with the Property Insurance Fund of the GSIS as required under RA No. 656, details of which are as follows:
