	OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)	FINANCIAL AND COMPLIANCE AUDIT



Understatement in Accounts Receivable, Income and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts



1)	In DHSUD-NLR, a total of uncollected fines and penalties of ₱24,998,661.00 for violation of laws and agency’s rules and regulations by the project owners/developers covering the period CYs 2011 to 2020 were not recognized in the agency’s books of accounts, thus, understating the Accounts Receivable, Income and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit).



Section 7, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I provides that “Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). The application of IPSAS, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair presentation.”



Likewise, Section 24, Chapter 5 of the same Manual provides that “Fines are recognized as revenue when the receivable meets the definition of an asset and satisfies the criteria for recognition as an asset.”



Item n, Article IV of Executive Order (EO) No. 648 authorized DHSUD to charge and collect fees in the performance of its functions. In line with this, issued Board of Commissioners Resolution (BCR) No. 760 approving the 2004 Revised Schedule 3 of Fees and Schedule of Fines and Guidelines for its Imposition as basis of computation of fines, penalties and other fees to be imposed.



For the years 2011 to 2020, DHSUD–NLR issued 64 agency orders due to violation of laws and agency’s rules and regulations defined under BCR No. 760, with the corresponding fines and penalties imposed to project owners/developers amounting to ₱24,998,661.00 as of December 31, 2020, as shown in the Table below:

Verification of the financial statements of the agency as of December 31, 2020 and inquiry with the Regional Accountant disclosed that the agency has not recorded the aforementioned transactions because they were waiting for the directive coming from their Central Office. The present practice of the agency was to record income only upon actual collection of the administrative sanction/fine regardless of when it was incurred. This understates the Accounts Receivable, Income and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit).



The non-recording of the above transactions is contrary to the afore-cited provisions of the GAM for NGAs and IPSAS.



Also, collection efforts by the agency were not monitored by the Administration and Finance Division contributing to further non-collection of the above receivables and the government’s opportunity to earn.



The collection efficiency of the agency is shown in the table below:

We recommended and Management agreed to require:



1)	The Accounting Section to record in the appropriate account Service Fees all uncollected fines and penalties from developers from final and executory orders and to disclose in the notes to financial statement; and



2)	The Chief Administrative Officer and the Monitoring and Adjudication Division to strictly monitor the service of writs of execution and appropriate collection of agency’s income.



In the exit conference, the Regional Director mentioned that our recommendations were already discussed during the Executive meeting. We were informed that at present there is no plantilla position for Sheriff in the department, the CO has still to issue a directive transferring the Accounts Receivable account, including the monitoring thereof to HSAC.



Meanwhile, pending the proposed transfer of responsibility, she will instruct her staff to set up a monitoring system to oversee the status of the writs of execution for CAR and to transfer writs of execution within the jurisdiction of DHSUD Regions I and II.









Unliquidated Fund Transfers (FT) to NGAs, LGUs, and GOCCs



2)	In DHSUD-CO, prior years’ FTs to NGAs, LGUs and GOCCs amounting to P8,500,055.04, P11,837,827.00 and P1,871,624.13, respectively, or an aggregate amount of P22,209,506.17 remained unmonitored and unliquidated, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994. Also, P2,636,389.22 or 11.87 percent of prior year’s balance unsettled and outstanding for 10 years or more and no request for write-off were filed pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005.



This finding is a reiteration of prior year’s audit observations wherein it was recommended: (a) to reconcile the discrepancies between the books of DHSUD and IAs based on the confirmation replies as well as to require the submission of the corresponding Report of Disbursements (RD) and Report of Checks Issued (RCI); and (b) to continuously send demand letters particularly those accounts that are outstanding for over two years already.



	COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 provides guidelines on government agencies in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to IAs as follows:

	

	Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit the RCI and the RD to report the utilization of the funds.  Only actual project expenses shall be reported.  The reports shall be approved by the Head of the IA. 

	

	Section 5.4 of the same circular states that “Source Agency (SA) shall require the IA to submit the required reports and furnish the IA with a copy of the journal voucher taking up the expenditures.”

	

Moreover, COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 prescribed the guidelines and procedures in reconciling and cleaning the books of accounts of NGAs, LGUs and GOCCs of dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated CAs and fund transfer for fair presentation of accounts in the FS. Paragraph 6.1 of the said circular states that:



	All government entities shall conduct regular meeting and analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due and demandable.



Under Memorandum Order No. 74, s.2002 issued by the Office of the President, directing the HUDCC to formulate and adopt certain guidelines and implement post-proclamation activities in areas proclaimed as socialized housing sites for deserving landless and homeless Filipinos. Now reiterated under Item 4.2, Sec. 4, Rule II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 11201 of the DHSUD dated July 19, 2019, as mandated to be as sole and main planning and policy making, regulatory, program, coordination, and performance monitoring entity for all housing, human settlement and urban development concerns primarily focusing on the access to and the affordability of basic human needs.



The then HUDCC and now DHSUD has been designated as the SA to fast track mobilization of projects pertinent to the implementation of the aforementioned directive, thus, transfer funds to concerned IAs in the NGAs, LGUs, and GOCCs for the post-proclamation activities.



	For CY 2020, the updated balance of various receivables from NGAs, LGUs and GOCCs based on the subsidiary ledgers of DHSUD as well as confirmation replies received from all IAs to confirm the balance of the accounts are summarized as follows:

	As of reporting date, out of the 20 confirmation letters sent to recipient IAs, only 11 replies were received by this office. It was observed on the foregoing table that there is P2,362,255.80 difference between the amount of confirmation replies received and the amount of FTs as per book. Inquiry from the Accounting Division disclosed that the failure to enforce liquidation and collection of any unexpended balance from such differences were manifested by leniency in their monitoring as well as failure of IAs to forward the necessary supporting documents for recording in the books.

	

	Analysis from the above schedule it can be gleaned that the FTs status were:



a)	it remained intact and were never used by some IAs;

b)	some were partly used and with huge balance still in the hands of IAs;

c)	others no reply were received by this office from the confirmation letters sent, thus, the agency has no information on the current balances or whereabouts of the FTs; and

d)	still a huge fund balance remained unspent for years with the IAs sufficient to support other important government projects.

	

	If this scenario continues, not given appropriate action and attention, we then can conclude that the implementation of the programmed government projects appears ineffective and the scarce government funds are left wasted. Moreover, on the financial issue, the receivable accounts cannot be relied upon due to the noted discrepancy.

	

	In addition, the Audit Team prepared a schedule of aging of the unliquidated fund transfers and showed that 72.98 percent or P16,209,451.13 of the total Due from NGAs/ LGUs/GOCCs were over five years or more already, as shown in the Table below.

	Likewise, out of the P22,209,506.17 total receivable balance, 11.87 percent or P2,636,389.22 represents receivables from LGUs and GOCCs were non-moving or dormant for over 10 years and no action was undertaken by the Management on these accounts of the IAs. These funds have been idle for several years in the possession of the IAs defeating the purpose of the FTs. Also, the following factors contributed to the accumulation of the outstanding balance: (1) the absence of monitoring body to check the progress, address arising problem on the agency’s project implementation; and (2) the lack of data or feedback mechanism for proper evaluation on the propriety of transferring funds to IAs.

	

	The problem of non-liquidation on FTs to concerned IAs is a recurring incident in the agency way back 10 years ago and more and if ever liquidated, there is no available data to serve for agency’s evaluation of its projects so to determine the success and failure and for strategies to improve future dealings, thus, to deter recurrence of the same issue, solutions must be established by the agency.



We recommended and Management agreed to require:



1)	The Department Secretary to create a committee to monitor the IAs’ implementation of the projects sourced from fund transfers;



2)		The Undersecretary and Assistant Secretary for operations and project implementation to establish a data bank containing information on all projects being implemented by the Department, so monitoring, evaluation, and address problems encountered so to improve its implementation, and most of all, to deter non-liquidation of FTs in the future; and



3)	The Accountant to exert extra effort to demand immediate liquidation of FTs to IAs with existing balances and to expedite the evaluation and reconciliation of all overdue accounts which are more than 10 years, if warranted, request for write off.



	The management commented that they have already directed their concerned officials and operating units to review their processes and systems, identify gaps and recommend appropriate measures to address them. 

	

	Relative to the lack of monitoring scheme, while there was a separate Accounting Division created, the priority then was to set-up the e-NGAs records and to provide technical assistance to their ROs especially to those designated accountants who do not have the expertise. Because of these priorities and partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they were not able to continue enforcing liquidations or refunds of transferred funds to IAs.

	

	Nonetheless, the agency will undertake the following Action Plans: (a) shall set-up and maintain system including ledgers for each account to ensure proper accounting of accounts; (b) conduct quarterly reconciliation of records with concerned services to ensure that the records are tallied and have been reconciled with the IAs; (c) the Chief Accountant will organize virtual meetings with his counterpart Accountants and/or Administrative Staff to determine the status of the transferred funds and demand liquidation/refund; (d) prioritize the recruitment of the personnel under the Bookkeeping Section of the Accounting Division to improve delivery of its functions; (e) shall issue demand letters to effect collection of unused funds, when necessary; and (f) to strictly enforce the policy that no new cash advance shall be transferred to concerned IAs until the previous funds have been fully liquidated.

	

	The management agreed to the recommendations proposed by the Audit Team, to wit: (a) shall create a Committee that will monitor the implementation of projects; (b) the Knowledge Management and Information Systems Service, shall setup project implementation data banks for the purpose of evaluation, monitoring, and addressing the problem to improve its implementation, as well as to deter non-liquidation of FTs in the future; and (c) the Chief Accountant shall send demand letters to the concerned LGUs, asserting, among others, the right to rescind contracts that have not been implemented, and request from COA the write-off of receivables which have remained dormant for the last 10 years.

	

	

	Unliquidated Cash Advance (CA) not properly recorded and supported with complete documentation

	

3)	In DHSUD-NMR, cash advances in the aggregate amount of ₱56,560.15 remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020 and was not properly recorded in the books of accounts and supported with complete documentations, contrary to the provisions of Section 12, Chapter 2 of the GAM, Volume II for NGAs and COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and resulting in the misstatements in the related expenses accounts. 

	

	COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides the following:

	

4.1.2 No additional CA shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous CA given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.

	

	5.3 Within ten (10) days after receipt of the report and supporting documents from the Accountable Officer (AO), the Accountant shall verify the report, record it in the books and submit the same with all the vouchers/payrolls and supporting documents to the Auditor. The CA shall be considered liquidated upon the recording thereof by the Accountant in the books of accounts although not yet audited by the COA auditor. (Emphasis supplied)

	

		5.8 All CAs shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year. Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipt. (Emphasis supplied)



Section 1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 requires that the AO shall liquidate CA within the following period:

	

--		Salaries, Wages, Allowances, Honoraria and Other Similar Payments - within five days after the end of the pay period.

	

--		Field Operating Expenses – within 20 calendar days after the end of the year subject to replenishment as frequently as necessary during the year.

	

--		Petty Cash Fund (PCF) – as soon as the disbursement reaches 75% or as needed, the PCF shall be replenished which shall be equal to the total amount of expenditures made therefrom.  In case of termination, resignation, retirement or dismissal of the PCF custodian, immediately thereafter. 

	

--		Traveling Expenses – within 30 days after the return of the official/employee concerned to his official station for local travel and within 60 days after the return of the official/employee concerned to the Philippines in the case of foreign travel.

	

--		Special purpose – as soon as the purpose of the cash advance has been served.

	

	Further, it provides the following documentary requirements common to all cash advances except for travels:

	

--		Authority of the accountable officer issued by Head of the Agency or his duly authorized representative indicating the maximum accountability and purpose of cash advance (for initial cash advance)

	

--		Certification from the Accountant that previous cash advances have been liquidated and accounted for in the books. Emphasis supplied

	

--		Approved application for bond and/or Fidelity Bond for the year for cash accountability of P5,001 or more (revised amount of CA requiring fidelity bond per COA Circular 2013-001) 



	Chapter 3, of the GAM, Volume III for NGAs provides the descriptions of all the accounts presented in Chapter 2 which include, among others, the account Advances to Officers and Employees as shown below:

This account is used to recognize amount advanced to officers and employees for official travel. Credit this account for liquidation of advances.

	

	Section 5.0 of COA Circular No. 2012-004 dated November 28, 2012, on the legal presumption against non-liquidation of CA under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code states in unequivocal terms that “The failure of a public officer to have duly forthcoming any public funds or property with which he is chargeable, upon demand by any duly authorized officer, shall be prima facie evidence that he has put such missing funds or property to personal use.”

	

	Verification of the year-end report of the agency for CY 2020 disclosed that as of December 31, 2020, the unliquidated CA of DHSUD Region X aggregated to ₱56,560.15 consisting of Advances to Officers and Employees.

	

	Inquiry was made with the accounting personnel since there was no further information provided in the Notes to Financial Statement on the subject account and it was disclosed that the reported account Advances to Officers and Employees was for training expenses which, as per GAM, does not conform with the description of the account because the said account is used to recognize amount advanced to officers and employees for official travel.

	

	Analysis of the details of the account Advances to Officers and Employees as of December 31, 2020 shows information summarized below:

	As can be gleaned from the above data, cash advances were granted despite non-liquidation of previous one, thus the accumulation of unliquidated CAs.

	

	The following are the shortcomings of the agency in handling its CAs: 

	

	a)		CAs remain outstanding or were not fully liquidated at the end of the year;

	

	b)		There were CAs, the purposes of which had already been served which were either unliquidated or partially liquidated but additional cash advances were still granted; and

	

	c)		The agency erroneously used the account Advances to Officers and Employees instead of Advances to Special Disbursing Officer;

	

	Further verification disclosed that the agency’s General Ledger (GL), Subsidiary Ledger, and status of unliquidated CAs were not readily available for audit verification, thus, it is difficult to properly examine and confirm the details and balance of CAs.

	

	Meanwhile, post-audit of Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) disclosed that the CAs were not supported with Certification from the Accountant that previous cash advances have been liquidated and accounted for in the books which is one of the documentary requirements in granting cash advances.

	

	Management has not been adhering strictly on the rendering of full accounting/liquidation of the AO’s CAs in pursuant to existing rules and regulations before granting additional cash advances.

	

	It should be noted that failure of the AOs to liquidate their cash advances within the prescribed period shall constitute a valid cause for the withholding of their salaries and the institution of other sanctions as provided for under Section 128 of PD No. 1445.

	

	As a result, the granting of additional CA to Officers and Employees/AOs without first requiring them to completely liquidate their previous CAs resulted in the accumulated CAs of the concerned individuals/AOs and exposed government funds to the risk of possible losses thru misapplication/misuse.

	

	We recommended that Management: 

	

1)		Ensure that CAs are fully liquidated on or before December 31 of the year to avoid accumulation of large amount of unliquidated CAs at the end of the year;

	

2)		Require the AOs to settle their previous cash advances prior to granting of another cash advance; and

	

3)		Require the AOs to immediately liquidate their CAs which remained unsettled after the prescribed period and refund the unused balances.

	

	Management explained that the CAs worth ₱56,560.15 were already liquidated right after it was utilized for its purpose but the Acting Accountant failed to submit the liquidation report to the Audit Team due to an honest mistake that the Acting Accountant, who is a licensed Engineer, lacks sufficient knowledge on the process of liquidating the CAs.

	

	Auditor’s Rejoinder

	

	The Audit Team emphasized that CAs can only be considered as liquidated upon the recording thereof by the Accountant in the books of accounts although not yet audited by the COA auditor.

	

	Further, Management should also consider proper orientation of the AOs responsible for CAs through conducting at least one-day tutorial or seminar, on the laws, rules, and regulations on cash advances such as the handling, custody and disposition of the cashbook, the utilization of cash advances, and their financial accountability.

	

	It is worth to mention that the Management agreed and committed to comply with our audit recommendations.

	

	

	Inefficient Collection of Receivables

	

4)		DHSUD-BR’s collection efficiency on receivables slacked off for CY 2020 resulting in the prolong recovery period and increase likelihood of non-collection thereof. 

	

	Item 6.1 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 December 19, 2016 provides that “All government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due and demandable x x x.”

	

	The reported agency receivables ensued from the transfer of account from the former HLURB, now reconstituted and known as the HSAC effective on March 01, 2019 under RA 11201. The Commission has exclusive jurisdiction over cases involving real estate developments, as well as cases involving Homeowners Associations.  Hence, all applications for permits and licenses, as well as cases pending with the HLURB and filed during the transition period were transferred including the related receivables account.   

	DHSUD now has a legally enforceable claim against delinquent clients, individuals or entities, whom the agency imposed fines or penalties for violation of certain provision of EO No. 648, in the previous years.  

	 

	The receivable account amounting to P313,000.00 remained uncollected and outstanding in the books, broken down as follows:

	During the year, no collection was ever made by the agency despite demand letters were sent to concerned persons/entities.  If this continues, this might result in the accumulation of overdue accounts and eventual loss of government funds.

	

	Collection of receivables from debtor is an absolute right of the creditor rather than a rule; hence, the agency should intensify its collection efforts to generate collection on its receivables.

	

	We recommended that Management establish debtors’ locations or addresses and resend demand letters to request for payment and to strengthen the agency’s collection efficiency.

	

	It was discussed in its letter reply that there was an error in recording the receivables in the previous years because some of which were not final and executory but only fines imposed.  Further, the accountant made it clear that only fines with a writ of execution should be booked up. Hence, further verification, analysis and validation of each account shall be made before a request for write-off will be made.

	

	

Unrecorded Guaranty Deposits



5)	Failure of the Accountant in DHSUD-SMR to account in the agency books the guaranty deposits made to SSS for the lease of its building resulted to the understatement of the account balance by P349,769.17 in violation of Section 111 of PD No. 1445 thus, may provide inaccurate information to the management for its decision making. 

PD No. 1445, particularly Section 111 thereof provides that:



(1) The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.



(2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.



For CY 2020, the DHSUD executed Contract of Lease with the SSS for its two owned units and four Parking slots at Pryce Tower Condominium, Pryce Business Park, JP Laurel Avenue, Davao City.



As part of the Lease Agreement was the provision of the Security/Guaranty Deposit required by the lessor (SSS) to the lessee (DHSUD) to guaranty compliance with the terms of the Lease Agreement in the amount of P349,769.17.



In the process of implementing RA No. 11201 wherein the DHSUD was created through the consolidation of the HUDCC and the HLURB and simultaneously with the reconstitution of HLURB into HSAC, all balances as of December 31, 2019 of the HLURB accounts were transferred to HSAC. One of the accounts being transferred was the Guaranty Deposits mentioned in the preceding paragraph. 



As justified by the former Acting Accountant, she revealed that she got a verbal instruction from their Central Office to record all balances of the former HLURB to the HSAC.



Let it be noted that the Lessee and occupants of the subject units and parking slots is the DHSUD.  Hence, it is reasonable to record the Guaranty Deposits account in the DHSUD books of accounts.



Thus, failure of the Accountant to account in the agency books the guaranty deposits made to SSS for the lease of its building resulted to the understatement of the account balance by P349,769.17 in violation of Section 111 of PD No. 1445, may provide inaccurate information to the management for its decision making.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



1)	Instruct the Accountant to transfer the Guaranty Deposits Account from HSAC to DHSUD Region XI to provide accurate information to management that there is still such amount readily available to satisfy the last month’s rental and for whatever the lessee may be answerable to the Lessor as stipulated in the Contract; and



2)	Prepare the necessary adjusting accounting entries to record the transferred account.



During the exit conference, it was learned that as compliance to the aforesaid recommendations, the Accountant who is assign to both the Department and the Commission was already instructed/ordered to transfer the guaranty deposits from HSAC to DHSUD.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Audit Team will however monitor the implementation of such transfers.





	Understatement of Inventories and Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts

	

6)	In DHSUD-SMR, transferred properties were not booked-up in compliance with the law creating the DHSUD and the HSAC thus, resulted in the understatement of Inventories and PPE accounts by P8,345,650.00 of the former as required under Sec. 43 of the IRR and its related provisions.



Section 4, Rule II of the IRR of RA No. 11201, otherwise known as the “DHSUD Act” states that:



The Department is created by the Act through the consolidation of the HUDCC and the HLURB, simultaneously with the reconstitution of HLURB into HSAC pursuant to Section 12 of the same Act.



Relative thereto, Section 43 of the IRR provides that:



Transfer of functions, assets and obligations. – All transfer of functions, assets, funds, personnel, equipment, properties, transactions and personnel in the affected national government agencies and the formulation and implementation of the internal organic structures, among others shall be completed within six (6) months from the effectivity of the Act . . . 



It is also clearly stated in Section 43.2 thereof that the allocation of existing equipment, funds and other assets of the HUDCC and HLURB shall be subject to the distribution of personnel to the Department and the Commission.



In compliance to the aforementioned provision of law and since the transition period in implementing it ended last December 31, 2019, starting January 2020, existing personnel from both HLURB & HUDCC were allocated to DHSUD Regions XI and XII and the HSAC including the distribution of PPE.



Verification as to distribution of the Inventories and PPE disclosed the following observations: 



a)	All inventories and properties previously recorded under DHSUD were transferred to HSAC books of accounts;



b)	Available records disclosed that only inventories and properties amounting to P1,105,269.33 were actually transferred to HSAC;



c)	The balances of inventories and PPE in the books of DHSUD was understated by P8,345,650.00 as of August 31, 2020 trial balance. Details are provided below:

In an inquiry with the former Acting Accountant, she revealed that she got a verbal instruction from their Central Office to record all balances of the former HLURB to the HSAC.  She did not consider that even if it was the instruction, she should have recorded the transfers within the period where there was actual transfer of assets to the Department and the Commission wherever appropriate. 



As a result, the cost of transferred inventories and property, plant and equipment amounting to P8,345,650.00 were not booked-up in the agency books as required under Sec. 43 of the IRR and its related provisions.



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant to:



1)	Properly coordinate with the Supply/Property Officer of DHSUD Region XI and secure the inventory of properties and its corresponding PAR issued to DHSUD Region XII and HSAC to determine the actual number and cost of transferred properties to DHSUD and HSAC; and  



2)	Prepare the adjusting accounting entries to record the transferred properties to fairly present the agency’s financial condition as of a given date.



During the exit conference, the management committed to conduct a joint inspection with the HSAC and to reconcile between the records per result of the actual physical inventory and the accounting records.  Then to proceed with the compliance of supporting documents to be attached to the Journal Entry Voucher for the recording of transfer of PPE.



Auditor’s Rejoinder



The Audit Team will be monitoring the status of its implementation.

	

	

Accuracy and existence of PPE cannot be ascertained



7)	The accuracy and existence of PPE accounts of DHSUD-CO cannot be ascertained due to: (a) failure of the management to submit a complete Report on Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) and discrepancy of P3,367,412.96 between the balance per books and per RPCPPE; and (b) disposal of unserviceable/obsolete properties amounting to P3,244,104.62 has not yet been undertaken by the Agency.



a)	Unreliable balances of PPE Accounts



PPE accounts with an aggregate balance of P57,347,730.81 cannot be relied upon due to: (a) failure of the management to submit a complete RPCPPE; and (b) discrepancy of P3,367,412.96 between the balance per books and per RPCPPE on six accounts which is contrary to Appendix 73 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II.



	Letter A of the Instructions in Appendix 73 of the GAM, Volume II, provides that “The RPCPPE is the form used to report on the physical count of PPE by type such as land, land improvements, infrastructure, building and other structures, machinery and equipment, transportation equipment, furniture, fixtures and books, etc. which are owned by the agency. It shall be prepared yearly by fund cluster.”



		Also, Letter E of the instructions of the same Appendix requires that “The RPCPPE shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned and Accounting Division/Unit not later than January 31 of each year.” 



Comparison of PPE balances per books and per RPCPPE disclosed a difference of P3,367,412.96 (consisting of eight PPE accounts with RPCPPE and four accounts with no RPCPPE submitted), details as follows:

		As can be gleaned from the table above, the balance of PPE accounts amounting to P57,347,730.81 could not be ascertained because of the following grounds:

		

	a)			there is a difference of P682,340.00 between the amount per books and per RPCPPE of Regular Fund. This discrepancy could be traced due to lack of periodic reconciliation between the records of the Accounting and Property Division, thus, casts doubt as to the details given which serve as basis to check the accuracy of recorded balance in the GL; and 

		

	b)		Property Officers and the Accountants of Trust Funds of TFBM and DOTR Resettlement Coordinator failed to conduct physical count of PPE. The physical count of all PPEs is a proof of its existence thereof and the RPCPPE establishes the correctness of their balances as presented in the financial statement.



We recommended that Management require:



		1)	The Property Officer concerned to conduct a complete physical inventory of PPEs pertinent to each fund and submit thereon so to validate existence, condition and accuracy of the reported balances in the financial statements; and     



		2)	The Head of the Accounting and Property Division to analyze and reconcile discrepancies noted between the GL and RPCPPE on the six accounts to appropriately effect the necessary adjustments to come up with the correct balance.  



The management commented that the personnel in-charge for both trust funds have already been directed to submit the required report and will ensure that their reports will tally vis-à-vis their accounting records.

 

For the discrepancy between the books and RPCPPE, the General Services Division (GSD) has already identified the cause of the discrepancy and will submit a revised RPCPPE. Moreover, the GSD and Accounting Division, on a quarterly basis will conduct reconciliation of accounts to ensure that succeeding reports are tallied between their respective records.



b)		Non-Disposal of Unserviceable/Obsolete Properties

	

	Disposal of unserviceable/obsolete properties amounting to P3,244,104.62 has not yet been undertaken by the Agency, contrary to the provisions COA Circular No. 89-296; Sections 40(d) and 42(h) of Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs; and Section 79 of PD 1445, hence, may result to its further deterioration and deprived the DHSUD of a higher return if these properties have been immediately disposed through sale or negotiation.  

	

	COA Circular No. 89-296 provides that “The authority and responsibility for divestment or disposal of property and other assets is lodged in the agency head or governing bodies.”

		

	Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides that “When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee an award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the Commission. In the event that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned and approved by Commission.”

	

	Furthermore, Section 40(d), Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides the policies on idle, unserviceable and fully depreciated PPE and prescribes that all unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74). PPE Reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE Less Accumulated Depreciation.)

		

	Section 42 (h) also states that IIRUP shall be used to account for all unserviceable property of an entity which is subject to disposal. It also serves as the basis in derecognizing the unserviceable properties carried in the PPE Accounts.

	

	Based on the submitted IIRUP and RPCPPE for CY 2020, the following unserviceable/obsolete properties were not yet disposed, to wit (Annex D):

Analysis from the above-mentioned table revealed that unserviceable/obsolete properties amounting to P3,244,104.62 remained in the books and still dumped inside the office premises awaiting proper disposal, of which P2,345,383.62 represents properties recognized in the IIRUP while P898,721.00 did not have IIRUP. Upon preparation of IIRUP, the Accountant should drop the unserviceable properties from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (Cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation.) However, the unserviceable properties remained in the books at the end of the calendar year 2020.



A PPE is unserviceable when the asset can no longer be repaired or reconditioned; maintenance or repair costs outweigh the benefits and services; has become obsolete or outdated; has been rendered unnecessary due to change in the entities functions/mandate; and has become dangerous or hazardous to health.



At present, these unserviceable properties remained undisposed. The agency must exert effort for the immediate disposal of its unserviceable properties to avoid reduction of the properties’ salvage value; prevent continuous exposure to elements, weather, wear and tear and other risks causing further deterioration thereby obtaining fair return in case of sale; to relieve accountability; and make available space for use of the agency.



We recommended that Management:



1)	Instruct the Property Officer to: (a) consolidate all unserviceable PPEs in the IIRUP; (b) submit complete disposal documents with appraised value to facilitate the inspection and evaluation; and (c) immediately dispose all unserviceable properties pursuant to Section 79 of PD 1445 and COA Circular 89-296; and



2)	Direct the Accountant to drop from the books all PPEs classified as unserviceable and listed in the IIRUP by debiting Impairment Loss-PPE (cost of PPE less Accumulated Depreciation.)



The management commented that a Disposal Committee will be constituted to recommend the disposition of the said unserviceable/obsolete PPE. Upon successful disposal, the corresponding PPE items will be dropped from the books. 



By June 2021 and November 2021, the GSD will ascertain the conditions of the PPE items at hand and if found unserviceable/obsolete, will recommend its disposition.





Non-inclusion of PPE items in RPCPPE



8)	The RPCPPE of DHSUD-BR as of December 31, 2020 is incomplete due to non-inclusion of PPE items still in the physical custody of the Agency and omission to disclose this information in the Notes to Financial Statements. 



COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 paragraph 5.1 states that “Each government agency shall conduct physical count of all its PPE, whether acquired through purchase or donation, including those constructed by administration and found at station.”



Section 42 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I defines RPCPPE as a form that shall be used to report the physical count and condition of PPE by type as at given date, including those which are unrecorded and those which could not be accounted for. It shows the balance of PPE per property card and per count and the shortage/overage, if any. It shall be rendered by the Inventory Committee, on its yearly physical count of properties owned by the entity.

DHSUD V as the newly created department took over the office previously occupied by the HLURB (now HSAC) where all the assets of the latter are situated.  DHSUD has no option but to assume responsibilities over the assets in their custody and utilized them in their regular operation although its records were already transferred to the books of HSAC.



The PPE accounts carried in the books of DHSUD included only one unit of motor vehicle, which was transferred from HSAC, with a book value of P47,950.00 and reported cost of P959,000.00 in the RPCPPE as of December 31, 2020.  However, those assets found at station were not included in the inventory report contrary to the general rule that PPE found at station at the time of physical count should form part of the inventoried items. 



DHSUD, being in possession of the said properties, should have included them in their physical count since these were found at their office during the period and report them accordingly in the RPCPPE noted as “found at station” while physical transfer of assets to HSAC were not yet completed. 



The Accountant explained that the transfer of these assets were not yet booked as advised by the Central Office Asset Management Division.  However, it is essential that PPE physically located in the Agency’s office be disclosed in the notes to financial statements, considering the significance of this information.



We recommended that Management instruct the:

1)	Supply/Property Officer to conduct complete physical count on all properties physically located in the office and prepare RPCPPE; 



2)	Accountant to disclose in the notes to financial statements those PPE found at the station; and   



3)	Supply/Property Officer and Accountant to expedite the transfer of records of these PPEs and its physical location to convey accurate information contained in the reports.



The Management commented that the PPE in question remained in the books of HSAC pending the final order to be issued by the Asset Management Committee regarding the distribution of assets.  In the meantime, the Accountant recorded only the transferred asset with supporting documents and those included in the RCPPE.



Moreover, those assets found at station or in the custody of the agency were adequately disclosed in the notes to financial statements while physical count of PPE shall be suspended until the final order from the Committee is received.  





Reliability of Other Professional Services Account cannot be ascertained

	

9)	The reliability of the Other Professional Services account of DHSUD-CO cannot be ascertained due to: a) the hiring of Contract of Service (COS) personnel to perform functions which are part of the agency’s existing regular employees’ job description; and b) non-submission of documentary requirements for the payment of wages to COS personnel.



a)	Hiring of COS personnel



Due to slow filling  of vacant plantilla positions, the agency resorted to the hiring of COS personnel to perform functions which are part of the agency’s existing regular employees’ job description not in accord with CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2017 dated June 15, 2017, as amended by COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2 s. 2020 dated October 20, 2020 on the Rules and Regulations Governing COS and Job Order (JO) Workers in the Government.



	Item 7.1 of the CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1 series of 2017 provides that “Hiring under COS shall be limited to consultants, learning service providers and/or other technical experts to undertake special project or job within a specific period. The project or job is not part of the regular functions of the agency, or the expertise is not available in the agency to directly undertake the service provided by the individual or institutional contractor.”

			

Item 7.2 of the foregoing further states that “Contract of service and job order workers should not, in any case, be made to perform functions which are part of the job description of the agency’s existing regular employees.”



Likewise, Section 7.3 states that “Contract of service and job order workers should not be designated to positions exercising control or supervision over regular and career employees.”



In CY 2020, the DHSUD hired 69 COS personnel charged to the Regular Fund of CO representing 57.98 percent of the total 119 regular employees of DHSUD-CO or filled out plantilla positions of the agency as of December 31, 2020. Details of the Service/Division assignment of the COS personnel were as follows:

It was noted from the COS that most of the hired COS personnel rendered the functions, duties and responsibilities of a regular employee. Review of the accomplishment reports revealed that the duties performed were administrative, clerical and technical functions which were similar to those being performed by the regular employees, hence, not complying with the aforementioned provisions under CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, series of 2017.



It was further observed that some of the COS personnel were entrusted of the custody of current and permanent files of the agency. Management failed to realize that government documents, funds and property should be given the highest level of fidelity and the person in possession thereof is accountable and responsible in its safekeeping, hence, should only be entrusted to regular employees.



Moreover, verification revealed that among the COS personnel, two were enjoying a salary designated to a managerial/top positions. Details provided in the Table below.

Senior Adviser for Public Assistance Office

Mar. 2 – Dec. 31, 2020

139,939.00



We noted that DHSUD hired the services of a Senior Technical Assistant for the period January 01, 2020 to March 31, 2020, but he was subsequently hired through coterminous status as Head Executive Assistant on February 3, 2020. The agency also hired a Senior Adviser for Public Assistance Office for the period March 2, 2020 to December 31, 2020. Subsequently, he was designated as OIC-Director for Public Assistance Service as indicated in the website of DHSUD.



In view of the foregoing, it is clearly not in conformity with the provisions under COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, series of 2017 which provides that COS/JO workers should not be designated to positions exercising control or supervision over regular and career employees. The agency should observe to maintain a reasonable pay gap between the regular employees to its COS personnel which were hired only to assist or augment the workforce of the agency. Likewise, the rate given to COS personnel higher than those performing direct supervision over him may affect the performance and/or moral ascendency of the regular employees.



Verifications disclosed that the authorized plantilla positions of the DHSUD for CO totaled 334, out of which 119 were filled out, hence, leaving a balance of 215 vacant positions. Had the management opted to fast track the hiring of vacant plantilla positions, the number of COS personnel could have been lessened and solved the issue regarding insufficiency of regular employees.



We recommended that Management require the Human Resource Development Division to:



1)	Fast-track the hiring of the vacant plantilla positions particularly in the Administrative and Finance Services to facilitate the processing of appointment/promotions and department financial transactions, respectively, both in the Central and Regional Offices; and

	

2)	Strictly monitor the hiring of COS personnel to ensure compliance with COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2017.  



The Management commented that they have been working double time to fill existing vacancies and beef up its workforce. While the recruitment process is being undertaken, the need to hire COS personnel became imperative given high volume of work and expanded services that the Department has to deliver.



Also, the agency’s Notice of Organization, Staffing and Compensation Action (NOSCA) from the DBM was only approved on December 19, 2019 and after several meetings/dialogues with the DBM, the adjusted/modified NOSCA was then issued on May 27, 2020.



Following the issuance of appointments to all placed personnel, all remaining vacant positions were published on July 20, 2020 to encourage more qualified individuals to apply. But the lack of enough personnel assigned in the HRDD, exacerbated by the restrictions brought about by the pandemic, proved to be the major challenges the Department confronted with.



Despite those constraints, the agency has already issued 364 out of 1,138 plantilla positions as of March 18, 2021. 



Meanwhile, the necessary endorsement and other supporting documents for the appointment to Director IV position of the current Senior Adviser for Public Assistance Office, a COS personnel, were submitted to the OP and are now in process.







b)	Non-submission of documentary requirements



The validity and accuracy of the payments amounting to P15,037,978.67 for the wages of the COS personnel for CY 2020 could not be ascertained due to the non-submission of documentary requirements such as approved Daily Time Records (DTR) and Accomplishment Reports, as required under Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 and Item 4.1.3 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012.



Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 requires that financial transactions and operations of any government agency shall be supported with complete documentation.



Likewise, Paragraph 3, Item 4.1.3 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, on the documentation of payments for the salary of personnel under Casual/Contract of Service, provides that the documentary requirements shall include: (a) Copy of the Service Contract; (b) Certification by the Personnel Officer that the activities/services cannot be provided by regular or permanent personnel of the agency; (c) Accomplishment Report; and (d) Approved DTRs.



Post-audit of the payrolls of COS personnel for the period January 2020 to December 2020 showed that some documents required under Item 4.1.3 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 were not attached to the payrolls nor submitted to the Audit Team.



Moreover, scrutiny of the payrolls revealed that only a summary of DTRs prepared by HRDD were attached to the claims. The exact time ins and outs of the personnel were not indicated in the said summary, hence, the amount to be paid cannot be validated during the processing of the payrolls in the Accounting Division.



As stated in the contract, the COS personnel have no employer-employee relationship and they will provide a full-time service at a monthly rate specified therein. Hence, submission of the above documents is necessary to ascertain the validity and accuracy of the payments of the salaries of COS personnel.



The practice of not submitting the required supporting documents for the payments of wages of COS personnel is not only contrary to the above stated regulations, but will result in the issuance of Notice of Suspension (NS) and subsequently a Notice of Disallowance (ND) if the NS is not complied within 90 days from receipt thereof.



We recommended that Management require the Chief Accountant and Chief Administrative Officer the submission of complete documentary requirements to support the payment of salaries/wages of COS personnel; and strict compliance to Sec. 4(6) of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012.



The management commented that they will issue a Memorandum to ensure compliance by all personnel in the submission of documentary requirements to support the payment of salaries, as provided in the COA Circular No. 2012-001.





Unreliable Income Account Balance



10)	In DHSUD-STR, correctness and reliability of Income account balance as of December 31, 2020 amounting to P49,396,699.70 could not be ascertain due to the absence of pertinent documents to support the Order of Payment (OP) issued by the Regional Accountant in the collection of fees and fines of the agency. 



	Item 5.1 of COA Circular No. 95-007 dated May 30, 1997 states that “The audit of revenues and receipts is conducted to provide an examination of the procedures followed by the assessing and collecting officers, to ensure that the government is receiving the correct amount of revenues and other receipts due it.”



	During the post-audit of the agency’s revenue, specifically the processing fees, it was observed that the only attached document in the Official Receipt (OR) is the OP prepared by the Regional Accountant, showing the amount to be collected. The detailed computation with signature of the preparer and reviewer is not attached. 



Also, the revenues of DHSUD IV-A from fines and penalties imposed by the agency to the erring developers is not supported with the Notice of Reported Alleged Violation (NORAV), Order of Imposition of Fines (OIF) and writ of execution, hence, the audit team could not determine the project and location since it is presented under the name of the developer, and could not also determine if payment is correct and complete or if payment was made in the period prescribed.



Interview with the Collecting Officer and the Regional Accountant disclosed that it has been their practice to just attach in the OR the OP and if source documents are needed in audit, they stated that it is available at the respective docket in the Records Section (RS).  It can be mentioned that the RS of DHSUD is not within the premises of building but is located on the adjacent building and will take hours before one docket can be located. With the volume of daily transactions, it is impossible to immediately validate the correctness of the amount in the OR, if it will still have to be referred one by one to the docket.



With this practice of the agency on not providing to COA the detailed computation sheet and related supporting documents to be attached in the OR for easy validation of payments, the correctness of the income account balance of P49,396,699.70 cannot be ascertained. 







We recommended that the Regional Director to:



1)	Provide sound internal control system on revenue administration system in order to ascertain that proper safeguards are in place; and

 

2)	Instruct the officer/s who is in-charge in the computation/assessment to prepare at least three copies of computation/assessment sheets, (one copy for COA, one copy for RS and one file copy at the Accounting Section) with attach names and signature of preparer and reviewer, and showing details of the project name and location, as well as the computation, and to attach the source documents of the basis of their computation, otherwise, all official receipts without computation sheets and documentary requirements will be suspended in audit.



Management commented that computation of corresponding fees were prepared at the Enforcement Monitoring and Evaluation Section (EMES) on a separate sheet of paper or directly on OP itself with the signature or initials of the preparer as they are the ones directly responsible on the variables being considered that pertains to corresponding documents clients are applying for.  Mathematical computations were then being checked and double checked by the Regional Accountant before affixing her signature on the said OP, giving assurance of correctness and reliability to the Collecting Officer as she issue OR reflecting details of such payment while correspondingly enumerated in her Monthly Report of Collections, thus, leaving those Computation papers, Notices of Admin Fines, Notices of Violations, Imposition of Fines unattached to the COA submitted reports while instead filed at their respective docket files or on other separate files.



Management assures to comply with the recommendations given by the auditor.





Failure to inspect and monitor development projects with issued License to Sell



11)	DHSUD-CVR and DHSUD-NCR failed to inspect and monitor 145 out of 261 and 20 out of 71 development projects with issued License to Sell (LS), respectively, for CY 2018-2020 within the prescribed period indicated under Section 11,  of the HLURB Board of Commissioners  Resolution No. 985 series of 2019, thus, any violations/deficiencies with corresponding imposition of fines/penalties defined under the HLURB Board of Commissioners Resolution No. 760 series of 2004 could not be charged immediately against erring developers, and the needed information or data on the status of the  existing projects of the developers are not readily made available to protect the buying public. 



	Section 11 of the HLURB Board of Commissioners Resolution No. 985, S. 2019 provides the regular or mandatory monitoring of new real estate development projects and it states that:

	

	The Regional Office shall conduct inspections or investigations of real estate developments regulated by the HLURB after six months from the date of the issuance certificates of registration and licenses to sell for the purpose of verifying whether the development or construction of the project is in accordance with the approved plans, work schedule and other requirements: Provided, That even prior to lapse of the said 6-month period, the Regional Office is not precluded from conducting an inspection or investigation upon information of any alleged violation of the laws, rules, regulations and standards of HLURB.

	

	The RS receives and checks the completeness of documents for the application of Development Permit (DP), LS, and other clearances relevant to real estate transactions. Likewise, its function includes registration of real estate brokers and salesmen engaged in selling condominiums, farm lots, memorial parks and subdivision projects. It is also in-charge of maintaining a list of projects with issued LS that serves as a monitoring tool in determining whether a contractor/developer has properly complied with existing laws, rules and regulations pertaining to real estate transactions. 

	

	The Housing and Real Estate Development Regulation Division (HREDRD) on the other hand, is in-charge of conducting site inspection, evaluates contractor’s/developers’ compliance with sound real estate management, issues NORAV and OIF for violations committed by developers, and determine project’s progress development.

	

	Review and verification of the list of projects obtained from the HREDRD revealed that 332 projects were issued LS for CYs 2018-2020, details were provided below:

	As shown from the table above, for DHSUD-CVR only 67 out of 261 projects were actually inspected, 23 of which were within the six-month period while the remaining 44 were inspected after six months from the issuance of the LS. Of the remaining 194 projects, 145 of which are already due for inspection.

	

	On the other hand, in DHSUD-NCR, only six out of 71 projects were actually inspected in CY 2020, three of which were within the six-month period while the remaining three were inspected after six months from the issuance of the LS. Of the 45 projects that are not yet inspected but are still within the prescribed period, five of which were already inspected in the first quarter of CY 2021. And out of the 20 projects that were not yet inspected as of December 31, 2020, five of which were also inspected in the first quarter of CY 2021.

	

	Interview with the official of HREDRD revealed that they were not able to conduct inspection/monitoring of all projects within the time frame due to lack of manpower. It was noted that the recruitment/hiring of additional personnel to complement and support the expected output is snail-paced. It was further disclosed that in order for the personnel to cope with the handling of various projects in several locations, they opted to strategize inspection and monitoring by prioritizing inspection of projects with more complaints and the contiguity of distance from one another so as to maximize time and output.

	

	Another factor that affects the monitoring was the declaration of lockdown of the national government due to COVID-19 from March 16-May 31, 2020 and August 4-18, 2020, implementation of Alternative Work Arrangement (AWA) from June 1, 2020 up to present and prioritization of backlogs in the previous years.

	

	The non-monitoring of the projects by the HREDRD within the prescribed period from the issuance of the LS resulted in the failure of the management to verify if the contactors/developers was really compliant with the approved plans of the projects and the conditions set forth in Section 11 of the HLURB Board of Commissioners Resolution No. 985, S. 2019. In addition, violations/deficiencies with corresponding sanctions like payment of fines and penalties defined under HLURB Board of Commissioners Resolution No. 760 S. 2004 are not immediately imposed and collected against erring developers. Moreover, information/data on status of developers’ progress on existing projects are not readily made available to guide the buying public.

	

	The poor compliance with the mandatory monitoring of projects after the six-month period could affect the collection of income considering that the Inspection Report is a requirement before the agency can issue a NORAV which is the basis of payment of fines and penalties by developers.

	

	

	

	

	We recommended that Management require the:

	

1)	Regional Director to strictly enforce compliance with the guidelines set forth under the HLURB Board Resolution No. 985, S. 2019 specifically in the monitoring of projects within the prescribed period; 



2)	Regional Director to evaluate/assess factors affecting performance of its personnel and make the proper recommendation for improvement, so the enforcement of the regulatory function of the agency is properly addressed; and



3)	OIC, Human Resources to expedite the filling of vacant plantilla positions to add complement to HREDRD so that the expected performance of the agency can be achieved.



The management commented that they are currently finding ways to maximize the limited number of resources available at the moment (i.e. limited utilization of service vehicles, limited time, and manpower) to be able to respond to the demands of the organization and its clientele.



It is also worth mentioning that with the implementation of nationwide quarantine last year and even up to now, many industries have closed down resulting to loss of jobs, many of whom are home/condominium unit buyers. As a result, complaints and requests for assistance have piled up, obligating the HREDRD to redirect its efforts to address these complaints by conducting conciliation conference.



Case in this point is the current work status of their Project Inspectors. Three of the said inspectors also act as conciliators. Thus, they are constrained to juggle their time conducting ocular inspections/investigations, preparing Inspection Reports and conducting conciliation conference at the same time.



Consequently, plan of actions and strategies are being established to improve the performance output, such as provision of additional service vehicle and subscription of video/virtual conferencing tools. And with the upcoming hiring of additional personnel, the Agency assures that the recorded backlogs and current projects shall be given top priority. Thus, improving HREDRD’s poor compliance with the mandatory monitoring of projects within the prescribed period.

	

	

	Absence of controls on Issued Notice of Reported Violation (NORAV)

	

12)		In DHSUD-STR, the absence of an established system and agency reports on the number and details of NORAV issuance to developers affects the   determination on the correctness and certainty of the imposed fines and penalties collection. The absence of monitoring system on issued NORAV can also create a great risk of possibility of non-collection of these revenues.

	Item 6.1 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 provides that “All government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected, when these becomes due and demandable xxx.”

	

	Under EO No. 648 series of 1981 and Section 38 of PD No. 957, the HLURB is empowered to impose administrative fines as the sole regulatory body for housing and land use development. It is tasked to develop standards and regulations for sound real estate practices.

	

	In order to protect condominium/subdivision buyers against erring developers, it is imperative that these projects be closely supervised, monitored and regulated. Monitoring techniques are employed by means of site inspection where it can be determined if there are violations committed. If violations were found, administrative fines/penalties are imposed for non-compliance of rules and regulations.

	

	As mentioned during interview with one of the employees of the HREDRD, it was disclosed that upon inspection of a project, if an assigned agency employee noticed any violation, a Site Inspection Report (SIR) will be prepared and signed by the inspector, stating the findings and recommendations for the imposition of fines. The SIR will be forwarded to the evaluator for further evaluation. A NORAV will be prepared which will state the violation/s found during inspection. The NORAV shows the violations and its corresponding computation of the fines/penalties. This will then be sent to the developer thru registered mail at the Philippine Postal Office. If there were no compliance on the part of the developer after the prescribed period, an Order of Imposition of Sanction (OIAS)/ OIF will then be served to them, and which has to be complied by the developer on or before the ordered time. If violations are acceptable, payment for the imposed fines/penalties will then be made by the developer to DHSUD. However, if they are not amenable, the developer submits a motion for reconsideration, to be evaluated again by the said division and approved by the Regional Director. Finally, a writ of execution will be issued by the agency. However, there were also instances that developers will ignore the OIAS/OIF and just let it sit with them.

	

	It was also disclosed during interview, that the agency will still have to wait for the receipt of the received copy of the registered mail of the NORAV from the Postal Office before OIAS/OIF be prepared and be issued to the erring developer. Since there was no status report being prepared by the department on a monthly basis, updates on the status could not be determined.

	

	This was verified upon the Audit Team’s request for a copy of status report on the issued NORAV as of year-end. The agency could not provide any report.  A format of the Monthly Action on Violations Found was submitted to the team, but when the team requested for copy of report which they allegedly been submitting monthly to the Head Office, they could not provide any.

	

	In view hereof, it is revealed that the agency does not have an internal control system over the NORAV issued, hence, there is a great probability of lost revenues due to non-maintenance of Status Report on all issued NORAV.

	

	We recommended that the Regional Director to:

	

1)		Set-up a system that could easily monitor the updates of all issued NORAV, which can immediately check whether prescribed period was abided or not by the developers;

	

2)		Consider sending in the official email address of the developer a copy of the NORAV, aside from sending it thru the Philippine Postal Office; 

	

3)		Instruct the Regional Accountant that documentary requirements must be present before issuance of Order of Payment;

	

4)		Instruct the Collecting Officer to review the correctness of the computation using the attached documents for each type of fee on the collection of revenues and submit to COA within the reglementary period the Monthly Report of Collections and Deposits with the ORs and deposit slips; and

	

5)		Provide/submit a copy to COA, on a monthly basis, all SIR, NORAV, OIAS/OIF and Writ of Execution as well as the Updated Status Report on Issued NORAV.



		The EMES being responsible in the updating of reports and keeping/monitoring of records of the issued NORAV commented that their section is only composed of five employees. They monitor/inspect/evaluate the existing four to five thousand projects, thus, it is already a struggle for them to monitor social media platforms for colorum projects and sales agent/s, together with an average of 40 incoming letters/inquiries a day, hence, the reason why they could not maintain and provide an updated status record/report of the issued NORAV.  Likewise, they also commented that they cannot provide such report because they are not being demanded to prepare and submit to COA ever since, nor their Head Office. They have promised to provide COA the SIR, NORAV, OIAS, Writ of Execution and to submit Monthly updated Status Report on Issued NORAV.

	

	

Inefficient record keeping and monitoring of the real estate brokers/salespersons



13)	The reliability of the long outstanding balance of Trust Liability account of DHSUD-NCR amounting to P25,562,740.12 could not be ascertained due to the inefficient record keeping and monitoring of the real estate brokers/salespersons. 



Item 1, Section 111 of PD No. 1445 clearly states that “The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.”



The agency is receiving consignation in the form of cash/surety bonds from broker/salesperson as part of the requirements under PD No. 957. This serves as a security deposit upon registration and it shall remain in full force and effect unless it is ordered, cancelled or released by the Board. These consigned monies are recorded under Trust Liabilities account.



As of December 31, 2020, the GL balance of Trust Liabilities account was P25,562,740.12 representing cash bonds from brokers/salespersons. 



Examination of the account showed that P15,237,740.12 or 59.61% of the total amount of P25,562,740.12 recorded as trust liabilities represents outstanding liabilities from two to more than ten years. Aging is presented as follows:

25,562,740.12



Based on the table above, the Trust Liability account amounting to P25,562,740.12 cannot be ascertained due to the non-reconciliation of records with the HREDRD.



Interview from management disclosed that the RS receives and checks the completeness of documents for the registration of real estate brokers and salespersons engaged in selling condominium, farm lots, memorial parks and subdivision projects. While the HREDRD is in-charge of maintaining a list of brokers/salespersons with issued Certificate of Registration that serves as a monitoring tool in determining the status of the said broker/salesperson. 



The HREDRD only provided the Audit Team with the list of newly registered and renewed brokers/salespersons for CY 2020. Status of brokers/salespersons that still have a cash bond but not renewed their registration for CY 2020 was not submitted. Furthermore, there was no monitoring as to whether these brokers/salespersons are still active sellers, deceased, or ceased from engaging real estate business. Thus, possible refund or reversion of payable account outstanding for two or more years and against no actual claim, administrative or judicial has been made, could not be done immediately.



The non-reconciliation of the Trust Liability account with the report from the HREDRD casts doubt as to the validity and existence of the transactions. 

We recommended that Management require:



1)	The HREDRD to update its record regarding the status of the registered broker/salesperson; and



2)	The Accounting Section to undertake a thorough review and analysis of the details of the Trust Liabilities account.



The management commented that the Regional Accountant initiated consultation with the staff assigned in processing the transactions involved in the audit  together with the head of the Records Unit to gather issues and information that could possibly affect the analysis and review of the details of the trust liabilities; and a team was created composed of representatives  from HREDRD, Records Unit, CAO, and the Regional Accountant to clarify issues gathered, prepare and document  guidelines and set parameters in updating and monitoring the required list. Consultation meeting shall be set.





Lack of control on the use of government vehicles



14)	In DHSUD-SMR, laxity in the accomplishment of approve driver’s trip tickets before any trip is undertaken was contrary to the certain provisions of COA Circular No. 77-61 thus, casts doubt as to the necessity of travel, reasonableness of fuel consumed and propriety of the reported expenses.



Among the specific rules and regulations provided under COA Circular No. 77-61 dated September 26, 1977, otherwise known as the “Manual on Audit for Fuel Consumption of Government Motor Vehicles”, are as follows:



	a)	The use of government vehicles should be properly controlled through properly accomplished and duly approved Driver’s Trip Tickets which should be serially numbered, a summary of which shall be made at the end of the month in a Monthly Report of Official Travels.



	b)	Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption of government motor transportation shall be submitted to the Auditor for verification purposes to determine the reasonableness of fuel consumed during the period.



Verification of the account – Fuel, Oil and Lubricants Expenses revealed the following observations, to wit:







The agency had maintained six vehicles and incurred a total amount of P165,427.65 for fuel, oil and lubricants as of August 31, 2020, details shown below:

During every vehicle’s need for fuel, oil and lubricants, the OIC – Administrative and Finance Division signed as noted by and duly approved by the OIC, Regional Director some sort of Unnumbered Purchase Order (PO) to serve as authority for the driver to withdraw for fuel from the gasoline station.



We likewise noted in that same document that the quantity to be fueled was not indicated.  The purpose of travel was also in the form but in most cases, the particular destination is not specified.  Considering the purpose of the travel stated in the PO, the fuel consumed cannot be justified.



We also observed that there was no document showing the name/s and signature of passengers, if there is any.



At a certain date, the gasoline station issued statement of account stating in particulars the date, Invoice No., plate no. of vehicle, unit price, no. of liters and amount.  



The preceding two documents which are the Unnumbered PO and the Statement of Account were the only documents found in the Disbursement Voucher (DV) supporting the transactions.



The driver’s trip tickets were not attached to the DV because these were not yet available and may not be strictly required before any trip is undertaken. More so, there were no Monthly Report of Official Travel and the Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption submitted to the Audit Team during the year.



When required to submit the lacking documents, we learned from the OIC – Accountant that the subject documents have still to be complied by the concerned drivers.  He also explained that one of the reasons why they find it difficult to comply the three mandatory reports was due to work from home status and implementation of skeleton workforce of the office.  Furthermore, there was no permanent driver assigned for every vehicle.  



Thus, laxity in the accomplishment of approved driver’s trip tickets for any trip undertaken, casts doubt as to the necessity of travel, reasonableness of fuel consumed and propriety of the reported expenses in contrary to the certain provisions of COA Circular No. 77-61. 



We recommended that Management:



1)	Instruct the OIC – Administrative and Finance Division to require all concerned drivers to secure authority from the Head of the Agency or duly authorized representative approved Driver’s Trip Tickets before any trip.

  

2)	Require the drivers to prepare the Monthly Report of Official Travels summarized monthly, and furnish COA a copy of this Report.  



3)	Submit to COA a copy of the Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption with complete details and Drivers’ Trip Tickets as attachments’ to DVs covering the payments of Fuel, oil and lubricants expenses from January to September 2020, and



4)	Instruct the Budget and Accounting Office to comply requirements on complete documentation in the processing of FOL expenses.  

		

During the conduct of the exit conference, the management informed the team that as of December 31, 2020, out of the six vehicles previously mentioned, only four were being maintained by DHSUD Region XI, two of which were already transferred to HSAC (SKY-681) and DHSUD Region XII (SKY-682).



The Toyota Innova (SKY-682) was only transferred to DHSUD Region XII last June 30, 2020 while Toyota Innova (SKY-681) was transferred to HSAC last September 30, 2020.  And there were no trip tickets of these two vehicles before the transfers took place submitted to the team as of to date.



Moreover, the management claimed that drivers were actually instructed to prepare their driver’s trip ticket before any trip is undertaken.  However, there were some trip tickets with incomplete data/information since there were other drivers who were not used to prepare the same.



As at audit date, the management was able to submit the trip tickets, Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption and Report of Official Travels of the two vehicles with Plate Nos. SAA 4405 and SAA 4398. 



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Audit Team acknowledged the partial compliance of the management by submitting the trip tickets and monthly reports of two vehicles.  The team expected for the full compliance of the above-mentioned documents required to support the payment of fuel, oil and lubricants. 



Likewise, the Team will continue to monitor the status of implementation of the above-stated audit recommendations.





Payment of goods through reimbursement basis



15)	In DHSUD-CVR, various procurement of goods totaling P79,624.25 were paid through reimbursement basis contrary to generally wide accepted practice of mode of disbursement. Hence, applicable withholding taxes were not imposed contrary to BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 2-98 dated April 17, 1998 as amended by Revenue Memorandum Order No. 23-2014 dated June 20, 2014.



Section 93 of PD 1445 provides that “The checks drawn against Treasury Checking Account of the agencies maintained with any government depository shall be made payable either directly to the creditor to whom the money is due or to a Disbursing Officer for official reimbursement.”



Reimbursement means repayment for the expenses incurred by an employee in discharging his official functions and while performing such duties incurs an immediate necessity to purchase using his personal funds in favor of the government in order to fulfil his job. Only under exceptional circumstances under existing rules and regulations that reimbursement may be resorted to as an alternative mode of disbursement like during emergencies or for immediate purchases. Another example is when the payment is minimal and the disbursement through check is impractical, hence petty cash can be used.



Under existing rules and regulations, payment by check/ADA is the generally accepted mode of disbursement. Where cash payment is allowed, it should be charged against cash advances or against Petty Cash Fund.



Section 10, Rule IV of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184 provides that all procurement shall be done through competitive bidding except as provided in Rule XVI of this IRR.



Also, it is the policy of the government to withhold certain percentage of taxed, among others, to be imposed to suppliers of the government or any of its political subdivisions. Thus, the amount to be withheld is prescribed under Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 2-98 dated April 17, 1998 as amended by Revenue Memorandum Order No. 23-2014 dated June 20, 2014 issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).



Verification and evaluation of the various payments for reimbursements totaling P96,532.14 as listed below, were paid mostly to Ms. Linella G. Cuevas, Chief Admin Officer. While basic procurement procedures were undertaken such as securing price quotations from at least three suppliers, the necessary withholding of taxes were not imposed, to the detriment of the government.

Had the agency withhold the applicable taxes, they would have helped the national government in contributing additional income needed for the country’s development programs.



We recommended that Management stop the practice of procuring goods through reimbursement basis in order that applicable withholding of taxes can be imposed.



Management commented that mostly of the reimbursements stated were bought during the first months after the lifting of the nationwide lockdown, which was in June and July 2020. During those times, only few of our suppliers were opened for business, thus, we bought from supermarkets or establishments that we usually do not transact with. These establishments dealt with cash basis only.



Furthermore, the various reimbursements were in the name of our employees, as we have not set up any petty cash fund during that month. In order to protect our employees and the public, expenses, like alcohol, thermal scanner, UV disinfection, plastic divisions, masks, etc., were bought with urgency in response to the new normal. Attempts were made to purchase alcohol and masks from the Procurement Service but they always ran out of stocks because of high demand. In addition, opening a credit line with gasoline companies is not feasible. They require an average of 10 to 20 thousand pesos per month, which was twice our actual consumption.

Management could have properly planned the procurement of supplies in response to the needs of employees during the time of pandemic. Hence, the condition of payment through reimbursement had been avoided.





Insufficient supporting documents for the payment of salary differentials and RATA



16)	The validity and propriety of the transactions cannot be ascertained due to insufficient supporting documents for the payment of salary differentials and Representation and Transportation Allowances (RATA) in DHSUD WVR and NLR, respectively, contrary to Section 5, Chapter 2 and Section 9, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I and item 5.2 of COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012.



a)	Payment of salary differentials in DHSUD-WVR for the months of January to April 2020 amounting to P69,073.63.



Section 5, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides, among others that “Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.”



Corollary thereto, Section 9, Chapter 6 of the same manual states that documentary requirements for common government transactions depending on the nature of expenses to be paid shall be complied with pursuant to COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, which prescribes the Revised Guidelines and Documentary Requirements for Common Government Transactions.



Post-audit of the disbursements of the agency from April to June 2020 revealed that the following documentary requirements were not submitted to substantiate the claim for salary increase for the months of January to February 2020: (a) Certified true copies of approved appointments in case of promotion or Notice of Salary Adjustment (NOSA) in case of step increment/salary increase and (b) Approved DTRs or certifications that the employee has not incurred leave without pay. The details of the disbursements with documentary deficiencies totaling P69,073.63 are shown below:

Inquiry with the Designated Accountant revealed that she requested from DHSUD Central Office the copies of NOSA for the RO VI employees but the said documents were still not received as at audit date. Certifications that the employee has not incurred leave without pay, on the other hand, were not prepared and overlooked by the CAO due to the volume of work as she performs various functions due to the lack of man power. It was also noted that DVs for the months of July to November 2020 were not submitted.



Processing claims despite the absence of necessary supporting documents, cast doubts on the validity and propriety of disbursements, and may result to the issuance of NS and/or ND.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Designated Chief Administrative Officer to prepare certifications that the employees who were paid salary differentials have not incurred leave without pay.



During the exit conference, Management was amenable to the recommendations and will prepare the required certifications. Moreover, copies of the NOSAs of Region VI personnel have already been submitted to the audit team.



b)	Payment of RATA in DHSUD-NLR to 15 personnel designated as Officers-in-Charge totaling ₱1,077,495.84.



Section 5, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides, among others that “Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.”



Section 5.2 of COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 provides, among others, the following documentary requirements to support the payment of RATA:



For Individual Claims 



-  Copy of Office Order/Appointment (1st payment) 

-  Certificate of Assumption (1st payment) 

-  Certification that the official/employee did not use government vehicle and is not assigned any government vehicle. 

-  Certificate or evidence of service rendered or approved DTR.



Item 8.1.1 of the NBC No. 548 dated May 25, 2013 states, among others, that “An OIC of a position, authorized in an agency staffing pattern and entitled to RATA, may be allowed to collect the RATA for the position on reimbursable basis, if stipulated in the office order designating him/her as such.”



Post-audit of DVs revealed that the agency processed the payments of RATA for the period January to December 2020 despite the absence of complete supporting documents contrary to the above mentioned guidelines.

It was also observed that aforementioned payments of RATA to OICs were made on a commutable basis instead of reimbursable, in violation of item 8.1.1 of the National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 548.



Reimbursable RATA should be supported by receipts or by a certificate to the effect that the expenses had been incurred in accordance with the purpose for which the allowance was granted.



The non-submission of complete supporting documents precluded the Audit Team to establish the regularity and propriety of the payment of said the allowances.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Administrative Officer to:



1)	Submit the following documents: (a) Certificate of Assumption; (b) Certificate or service rendered or approved DTR; and (c) Receipts or a certificate to the effect that the expenses had been incurred in accordance with the purpose for which the allowance is granted (For reimbursable RATA); and

 

2)	Strictly observe the provisions of NBC No. 548 in the payment of reimbursable RATA.



During the exit conference, the audit team informed that OIC- Division Heads are entitled to reimbursable RATA based on the actual days when the OIC reported for work or while on Skeleton Work Arrangement. The purpose of which is to defray expenses while in the actual performance of the duties and responsibilities of their positions. What was paid to OIC-Division Heads for CY 2020 are commutable RATA. The accountant informed that payment was charged to savings.



RATA is commutable if the grant is specifically authorized by law and if the funds for its payment are provided for in the agency budget. The authorized agency budget for RATA is ₱564,000.00 based on RA 11465 or the 2020 General Appropriations Act. It is intended for the RATA of the OIC-Regional Directors and the OIC-Assistant Regional Directors for CAR, Region I and II.



Management informed that the grant of RATA to OIC-Division Heads is explicitly authorized by the Department Secretary. Payment, however, is subject to DBM, CSC and COA Rules and Regulations.



Management admitted that the allotment for RATA was insufficient, however, they will seek clarification from their Central Office on this issue.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The agency’s submission of the required documentary requirements will be subject to our further evaluation and validation since the requirements were submitted only on March 5, 2021.





Unreliable Leave Credit Balances of Personnel



17)	DHSUD-WVR’s practices in the accrual and use of Compensatory Overtime Credits (COCs) were not in accordance with the provisions of CSC-DBM Joint Circular No. 2, series of 2004 dated October 4, 2004, thereby casting doubts on the accuracy and reliability of the leave credit balances of its personnel.



CSC-DBM Joint Circular No. 2, series of 2004 dated October 4, 2004 entitled “Non-monetary Remuneration for Overtime Services Rendered” prescribes the guidelines on the availment of compensatory time-off in lieu of overtime pay. It provides the following definition of relevant terms:



Compensatory Overtime Credit (COC) refers to the accrued number of hours an employee earns as a result of services rendered beyond regular working hours, and/or those rendered on Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays or scheduled days off without the benefit of overtime pay.



Compensatory Time-Off (CTO) refers to the number of hours or days an employee is excused from reporting for work with full pay and benefits. It is a non-monetary benefit provided to an employee in lieu of overtime pay.



Section 5.2 of the Joint Circular states that the Head of Office shall determine the need for overtime services. In this regard, the Office concerned shall issue an office order specifying the date and time for rendition of overtime, and its purpose.



Moreover, Section 5.5 provides the following pertinent rules on the accrual and use of COCs:



5.5.1 Each employee may accrue not more than 40 hours of COCs in a month. In no instance, however, shall the unexpended balance 120 hours; and



5.5.2 The COCs shall be used as time-off within the year these are earned until the immediately succeeding year. Thereafter, any unutilized COCs are deemed forfeited.



On the other hand, Section 5.6.1 provides as a limitation, that COCs cannot be used to offset undertime/s or tardiness incurred by the employee during regular working days.



With regard to the relevant forms involved, Section 5.8 provides that an employee who has earned COC shall be granted a Certificate of COC Earned, duly approved and signed by the Head of Office. The certificate indicates the number of hours of earned COC by the employee in a month. The certificate would be issued at the end of the month.



Section 6 thereby prescribes the following procedures to be observed in the rendition of overtime services and availment of compensatory time-off:



6.1 The Head of Office/authorized official issues an Office Order authorizing the rendition of overtime services and indicating the tasks to be completed and expected time of completion;



6.2 The employee renders overtime services as stipulated in the Office Order;



6.3 The Human Resource Management Office prepares a summary of overtime services rendered in a month, and computes the equivalent COCs, for the purpose of the issuance of the COC Certificate;



6.4 The Head of Office issues the Certificate of COCs Earned, specifying the number of COCs earned in a month;



6.5 The employee requests approval from the Head of Office on the schedule of CTO; and



6.6 The employee avails of the CTO.



Verification of sample leave cards (LCs) of six (6) personnel of the agency disclosed the following deficiencies (See Annex E):



				a)	COCs were used to offset undertime(s)/tardiness incurred by employees during regular days;

				b)	Absences charged to COCs were not supported with the required Certificates of COCs Earned and Leave Forms; and



				c)	Mathematical errors were noted in the computation of leave balances.



Perusal of the agency’s existing records revealed that the rendition of overtime services, as well as the accrual of COCs were authorized by the Agency Head(s) by issuing Special Office Orders at the start of every calendar year. These documents stated that services rendered by personnel on weekends and holidays, when covered by travel orders/authorities, shall be treated as overtime and shall therefore accrue COCs. The corresponding CTOs may then be availed by personnel as half or full day leave from work or used to offset their undertimes and tardiness.



In addition, the COCs did not expire and were continuously accrued and made available for use over several years, starting in CY 2012 all the way to CY 2020. This practice was also authorized thru issuance of Special Office Orders citing the extension of validity as fair treatment to workers who could not avail of CTOs due to exigency of the service. It was also discovered that no Certificates of COCs Earned were issued to personnel who rendered overtime services and no Leave Forms for availment of CTOs were attached to DTRs. COC balances were maintained and updated by the former Chief Administrative Officer/concurrent HRMO, who was in charge of recording changes in the balances.



Inquiry with the former CAO/HRMO revealed that these practices were done with the best of intentions, as a means to give the regional personnel some non-monetary motivation for working beyond the regular office hours/days required by law. Her heavy workload and concurrent functions also prompted the lapses in procedure and inability to make use of the required forms. While the Special Office Orders issued were meant to authorize remuneration for personnel working overtime, this does not exempt management from ensuring proper implementation of existing guidelines and to act accordingly should violations or irregularities be committed.



The deficiencies observed in five of the six sample leave cards suggests that there is a high probability that the rest of the LCs have inaccurate balances as well. The violations to the provisions, procedures and forms prescribed by CSC-DBM JC No. 2, series of 2004, intentions notwithstanding, have rendered unreliable, the leave credit balances of the agency’s personnel.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the:



1)	Designated Chief Administrative Officer to:



							a)	backtrack and review postings and computation of the leave balances as reflected in the Leave Cards and ensure that: (1) COCs are not used to offset undertimes/tardiness of employees, and (2) absences charged to COCs are duly supported with Certificates of COCs Earned and Leave Forms;



							b)	ensure that unutilized COCs are forfeited upon expiration of their validity;



							c)	maintain and submit a monthly report on summary of overtime services rendered and the equivalent COCs to the Head of Office; and



d)	regularly review the DTRs, Applications for Leave and supporting documents, and the postings made to the Leave Cards.



2)	Head of Office to:



							a)	appropriately authorize employees to render overtime services by issuing office orders specifying the date and time for rendition and its purpose;

							b)	grant Certificates of COCs Earned, concurrently setting safeguarding measures to prevent any form of fraud and/or duplicity;



							c)	approve/disapprove applications for CTO (Leave Forms) based on duly approved and unexpired Certificates of COCs Earned, without compromising the delivery of services to clientele; and



							d)	ensure proper implementation of all the guidelines set forth in CSC-DBM Joint Circular No. 2 series of 2004, dated October 4, 2004.



During the exit conference, Management disclosed that the Designated Chief Administrative Officer is already in the process of back tracking the computation of leave balances. They have also pledged to abide with all the provisions, procedures and forms prescribed in CSC-DBM JC No. 2 series of 2004.





Manually-Prepared Daily Time Records (DTRs)



18. 	Entries in the DTRs of DHSUD-WVR personnel for the months of April to November 2020 were recorded manually, despite the availability of time sheet reports generated by a biometric machine for timekeeping, contrary to CSC Memorandum Circular No. 21, series of 1991 dated June 4, 1991, rendering these records susceptible to the risk of possible manipulation which may result in unreliable attendance information.



Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular No. 21, series of 1991 dated June 4, 1991 provides that all officers and employees shall record their daily attendance on the proper form or, whenever possible, have them register on the bundy clock. Any other means of recording attendance may be allowed provided their respective names and signatures as well as their time of arrival to and departure from their respective office are indicated, subject to verification. All other officials including presidential appointees who are not required to use bundy clock shall hereinafter record their attendance in the manner prescribed by the Office and their absences shall be covered with requisite leaves of absence.



In line with Malacañang’s reminder to government employees to follow regulations on work hours, the CSC has also urged all government agencies to adopt appropriate mechanisms to strictly monitor and record attendance of employees such as the use of biometric time clocks and other forms of attendance systems. Biometric verification of an individual’s unique biological characteristic, like a fingerprint, prevents fraudulent attendance entries and encourages employees to report on time, thus, increasing productivity.



Review of the DTRs submitted for the months of January to November 2020 revealed that for the months of April and November 2020, entries to the DTRs were recorded manually, despite the availability of time sheet reports generated by the biometric machine to record timekeeping. It was also observed that Certificates of Appearance (CAs) of personnel on official business (OB) were not attached to support the DTRs.



Inquiry with various personnel revealed that they were instructed not to use the biometrics machine as a health protocol due to the current pandemic. While a logbook was indeed maintained to record attendance, no specific personnel was designated to verify and review the entries made therein. Moreover, the logbook or copies of its pages, were not attached to support the submitted DTRs.



The practice of manually recording entries to the DTRs renders these records susceptible to the risk of possible manipulation which may result to unreliable attendance information.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the:



1)	Agency employees to register their daily attendance on the biometric machine and logbook; and



2)	Designated Chief Administrative Officer to: (a) utilize and submit Daily Time Records (DTRs) generated by the biometric machine together with complete supporting documents; and (b) regularly verify and review the attendance entries made in the logbook.



During the exit conference, Management informed that all personnel are currently using the bundy clock for their daily attendance and simultaneously records the time entries in a logbook. They also disclosed that the guard on duty maintains a separate record of attendance as an added internal control measure. The Designated CAO has taken note of the recommendations and has already attached all the required supporting documents to their monthly DTRs. She also committed to regularly verify and review the attendance entries made in the logbook.





Non-segregation of duties



19. 	The DHSUD-NMR’s Collecting Officer acts simultaneously as the agency’s Petty Cash Custodian and Special Disbursing Officer (SDO) contrary to sound internal control system, thus, exposes government funds to greater risk of use or misappropriation and difficulty in tracing or detection of possible errors or concealment.

Section 2 of PD No. 1445 states that “All resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.”



Section 50 of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM), Volume I provides the following provisions on the segregation of duties:



a.   To ensure that effective check and balance exists and to prevent any one employee from perpetrating or concealing irregularities or illegal acts alone, no one person or department should be in complete control over a transaction. (emphasis supplied) 



The person responsible for an error cannot be expected to report its occurrence. Consequently, significant phases of transactions should be identified and each phase assigned to a different person. In this way, the work of one provides an automatic check on the work of another. (emphasis supplied) 



				a)	To reduce the tendency of custodians to conceal the misuse of assets entrusted to them through the manipulation of records and the use of improper entries, access to records must be restricted to persons not involved with custody.



				b)	To reduce the opportunity for establishing complete control over functions and resources over which authority is exercised in the course of a regular job, employees occupying sensitive positions must be regularly rotated or required to take forced leave. The assignment of their tasks to other employees provides an automatic check over their functions.



Strong internal control system safeguards government assets; checks accuracy and reliability of accounting data; ensure economical, efficient, effective and ethical operations; comply with laws and regulations; and adhere to managerial policies. Segregation of incompatible duties such as the collecting and disbursing functions is one of the control methods and measures of a sound and strong internal control system.



Scrutiny of the functions and designations of the agency’s personnel revealed incompatible duties were performed by one and the same person. The Accountable Officer (AO) who collects income receipts was also designated as the Petty Cash Fund Custodian and at the same time tasked to perform the functions of an SDO due to the transfer to other station of the former SDO. There was no proper segregation of duties, hence, there was high risk of occurrence of errors or fraud.



Segregation of duties is a key internal control intended to minimize the occurrence of errors or fraud by ensuring that no employee has the ability to both perpetrate and conceal errors or fraud in the normal course of their duties. It must be given emphasis that proper segregation of duties in every government agency shall be placed to avoid the possibility of risk of misappropriation of funds such as “lapping” or the use of one fund to cover the shortage of another fund.

Inquiry with Management disclosed that while they are still on the process of hiring and designating permanent and separate AOs for collections and disbursements, Ms. Estera was temporarily designated to assume the functions of both. Further, Management emphasized that they are still adjusting with the new structure and relocation of their agency, DHSUD, which is a result of merger of the HUDCC and the HLURB, with the former becoming defunct and the latter reorganized as the HSAC.



Review of the agency’s collections for CY 2020 revealed that the agency’s monthly collections ranges from ₱26,000.00 to ₱2,700,000.00 while the monthly petty cash fund and special cash advances ranges from ₱9,000.00 to ₱13,000.00. Thus, it is urgent that there should be at least three different individuals who will perform the functions of collecting and disbursement of government fund.



It is worth to note that Management committed to designate separate AOs for collections, disbursements, and petty cash fund.



We recommended that Management make proper designation of AOs holding permanent positions for the collections, Petty Cash Fund, and Special Cash Advances, must be properly bonded and to furnish COA with all Office Orders. 



Management commented that:



							a)	There is only one staff for the Admin and Finance Division, the Acting Cashier, who is in-charge of the collections, petty cash fund, and special cash advances. The Management acknowledged that this caused a lot of risks and explained that they are still in the process of hiring and filling-up the available positions in the division in order to unload the Acting Cashier of some of her responsibilities; and 



							b)	The management also designated a new SDO and plans on designating an officer who is going to be in-charge of the Petty Cash Fund, provided that he/she is holding a permanent position and is properly bonded.





Transfer of accountability not properly documented



20. In DHSUD-NMR, there was absence of proper turn-over of accountabilities between the incoming and outgoing AOs not in accord with Section 77 of PD No. 1445. 



Section 77 of PD No. 1445 provides that “When government funds or property are transferred from one accountable officer to another, or from an outgoing officer to his successor, it shall be done upon properly itemized invoice and receipt which shall invariably support the clearance to be issued to the relieved or out-going officer, subject to regulations of the Commission.”



Chapter III of the Revised Cash Examination Manual requires the conduct of mandatory cash examination under the following circumstances: 



a)	Before the AO retires or is separated from the service;



b)	Before he is transferred to another station or office;



c)	When he goes on extended leave of absence and another AO is designated in his place; and



d)	When loss of government fund by an AO is reported.



It was observed that there was no proper turnover of accountability from the previous SDO, Mr. Rodrigo B. Tubog, to Ms. Emy Lou Estera as the new SDO of DHSUD Region 10. There was no itemized invoice and receipt presented or a copy thereof, if there was, the Office of the Auditor was not furnished. This receipt will not only officially inform the Audit Team of the new designated AO but will also determine the amount of accountability of the outgoing AO transferred or turned-over to the incoming AO. Thus, due to lack of information and receipt of turnover documents, no cash examination was conducted on the account of the former AO by the previous Auditor.



The absence of proper turnover was only discovered by the current Audit Team during farewell or “despedida” celebration of the outgoing SDO sometime in December 2020.



As a result, without the proper turnover between incoming and outgoing SDOs and non-conduct of cash examination on the accounts of the latter, we could not determine whether the outgoing SDO was cleared of his accountability and no incurrence of loss of government fund.



	We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief Administrative Officer to require the outgoing SDO to prepare a properly itemized turnover report to be received by the new or incoming SDO, as supporting document of his clearance, and copy furnish the Audit Team; and to strictly observe the provisions of Section 77 of PD No. 1445 whenever changes or transfer of accountabilities are made, copy furnished the Office of the Auditor.



In response to the aforementioned observation and recommendations, Management submitted an explanation for the improper or lack of turnover report from the old SDO. Further, the Management committed to follow the guidelines provided whenever there are changes or transfers of accountabilities among its accountable officers.

Non-submission of Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) within the prescribed period



21. DHSUD-CO and STR failed to submit the monthly BRS within the prescribed period under Sections 4 and 5 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus, precluding the Audit Team from conducting the timely analysis and audit of the accounts/transactions. 



Section 74 of PD No. 1445 states that “At the close of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition of the agency account standing on their books. The head of the agency shall see to it that a reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the reports and the balance found in the books of the agency.” (Emphasis supplied)



On the other hand, Section 122 of PD No. 1445 states that “Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the COA may under regulations issued by it require the agency head, chief accountant, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers and other responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its function. X x x x.”



	In addition, Sections 4 and 5, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I states that “The monthly BRS shall be prepared by the Chief Accountant/designated staff for each of the bank accounts maintained by the agency/entity using the Adjusted Balance Method.  The Chief Accountant/Designated staff shall within 10 days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statements (BS) together with paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memo (CM) from the Government Servicing Bank (GSB), reconcile the BS with the General Ledger and prepare the BRS in four copies.”

The failure of the Management to submit within the prescribed period the above documents/reports affected the review and analysis of the accounts as well as the verification of the validity and regularity of the cash transactions, thus, precluding the timely communication of the results of audit.

	

	We recommended that Management requires the Accountant the timely submission of the monthly BRS to facilitate the review and analysis of the cash accounts and to affirm the reliability of the management’s assertion on the validity of transactions.  

	

The Management informed the Audit Team that the delay was due to the delay of receipt of Bank Statements from the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP). Nonetheless, the BRS were already being prepared and will be submitted to the Audit Team.



The Management is still waiting for the LBP’s approval on their iAccess for the Modified Disbursement System (MDS) account. Nonetheless, the agency has instituted measures to ensure timely submission of the monthly BRS.





Delayed submission of DVs



22.  The DHSUD-CO, NLR, WVR and NMR failed to submit the DVs together with the corresponding supporting documents within the prescribed period, thus, precluding the Audit Team from conducting the timely analysis and audit of the accounts/transactions.



Section 122 of PD No. 1445 states that “Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers and other responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, x xx, such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its function.  (2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have complied with the requirements of the Commission. (3) No appropriation in the General Appropriations Act Shall be available to pay the salary of any official or employee who violates the provisions of this section, without prejudice to any disciplinary action that may be instituted against such official or employee.”



Section 7.1.1 of the 2009 RRSA as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 states that “The head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: (a) the required financial and other reports and statements are submitted by the concerned agency officials in such form and within the period prescribed by the Commission; (b) xxx.”

	

	Section 7.2.1 of the same RRSA, also provides that “The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that: (a) the reports and supporting documents submitted by the accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first 10 days of the ensuing month; (b) xxx.”

		*Submission of reports was adjusted due to ECQ

		

Management’s failure to submit promptly the above documents/reports caused delay in the review and analysis of the accounts as well as the verification of the validity and regularity of the transactions, thus, precluding the timely communication of the results of audit.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountants to ensure the prompt submission of the DVs with complete supporting documents to facilitate the timely review and analysis of the accounts.



Management has already submitted the following DVs with the corresponding supporting documents to the Audit Team. Details provided in the table below:

Non-submission of Contracts and Purchase Orders (POs) within five days after perfection

23.  In DHSUD-NTR, STR and NMR, delay in the submission of approved copies of contracts and POs, together with the supporting documents to the Audit Team within five working days from the issuance of such purchase orders and perfection of contracts precluded the prompt review of the procurement transactions and detection/correction of possible deficiencies in violation of the provisions of COA Circular No. 2009-001. 

Item 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 requires that: “within five working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.” 

Further, Item 3.2.1 of the same Circular provides that “A copy of any PO irrespective of amount, and each and every supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned. Within the same period, the Auditor shall review and point out to management defects and/or deficiencies, if any, xxx.”



Likewise, Item 4.1 of the said Circular further provides for the penalty that may have been forced for failure to comply and it states that “Any unjustified failure of the officials and employees concerned to comply with the requirements herein imposed shall be subject to the administrative disciplinary action provided in (a) Section 127 of PD No. 1445; (b) Section 55, Title I- B, Book V of the Revised Administrative Code of 1987; and (c) Section 11 of Republic Act No. 6713.”



Review of the payments of various expenses covered by contracts and POs as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that contrary to the above regulations and provisions, the agency’s contracted services and POs for various purchases were not furnished/submitted to the Audit Team within five working days from execution in case of contracts or within five working days from their issuance to supplier/service provider for POs. Summary of the payments made was provided in the table below:

Post-audit of the transactions also revealed that copies of contracts and purchase orders were attached to the DVs and were submitted at the same time that they submit their monthly reports. 



Non-submission of said contracts, POs and their supporting documents within the prescribed period resulted in the delay in the review of consummated transactions as to compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations and reasonableness of prices of the items procured/contracted.



We recommended and Management agreed to submit to the Audit Team the approved contracts and POs within five days from the execution together with supporting documents as required under COA Circular No. 2009-001.





Compliance with Oversight and Monitoring Functions of DHSUD



24.  DHSUD properly monitored the report of the attached agencies relative to the implementation of program and projects in compliance with Section 8 of the IRR of RA No. 11201.



Section 8 of the IRR of RA No. 11201, entitled Oversight and Monitoring Functions of the Department, mandates that:



		8.1 Monitor and evaluate the performance and accomplishment of the attached agencies with respect to their housing and urban development policies, programs and projects, and ensure the coordination thereof with the Department and the national government; 



	8.2	Develop and establish a sector performance monitoring and assessment mechanism to accurately and independently report on the performance of national government agencies (NGAs) and LGUs involved in housing and urban development or with infrastructure projects affecting informal settlers, including a framework for regular review, evaluation and assessment of their programs and projects to ensure the continuing improvements in housing sector policy and strategy formulation;

 

8.3 	Require NGAs and LGUs to report and regularly submit relevant and necessary data and information; and 



8.4 	Generate data analyses and recommend policy measures to address perceived and potential issues.

The DHSUD is the central housing authority in the Philippines. In this regard, it shall exercise administrative supervision over the following housing agencies, which shall remain to be attached for purposes of policy and program coordination, monitoring and evaluation:



1)		National Housing Authority (NHA) 

2)		National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation (NHMFC)

3)		Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF)

4)		Socialized Housing Finance Corporation (SHFC)

	

	In compliance with its oversight and monitoring functions as defined by Section 8 of the IRR of RA No. 11201, the DHSUD created a template to monitor and evaluate the performance and accomplishment of the attached agencies with respect to their housing and urban development policies, program and projects. The attached agencies shall submit the accomplished template on a quarterly basis.

	

Verification revealed that DHSUD properly monitored the reports of the attached agencies relative to the implementation of program and projects. The actual accomplishments were compared to their targets, and the reports were submitted on a quarterly basis and were aligned within the prescribed time set by the Department to its attached agencies.



Based on the audit work performed, the DHSUD is in compliance, in all material respects, with Section 8 of the IRR of RA 11201 entitled Oversight and Monitoring Functions of the Department.





B)	OTHER AREAS





Dormant Accounts



25.  Of the total amount of P316,451.10 in the Other Receivables account, P299,895.10 of which have been inactive for more than 10 years. These pertain to the unsettled cash advances, and refund of salaries and bonuses, traveling expenses and personal calls of former HUDCC officials, employees and detailed personnel. DHSUD already requested for write-off but were denied due to lacking documents.





Gender and Development (GAD) 

		

26.  DHSUD-CO, NLR, STR and SMR were not able to formulate and submit GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for CY 2020 for evaluation. Consequently: a) the required five percent of the Agency Budget was not allocated for GAD programs and projects; b) there were no GAD related activities conducted for CY 2020; and c) no GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) was submitted. As a result, Management was not able to realize the objectives and benefits for which the GAD has envisioned.

This is a reiteration of prior year’s audit findings of DHSUD-CO wherein we recommended to: (a) Strictly adhere to the provisions of the GP of the GAA and ensure that at least five percent of its budget is allocated to provide more comprehensive and responsive GAD plans and programs; and (b) Formulate a feasible GAD plan and programs that could be implemented for a given period.



Section 31 of the GP of RA No. 11465 states that “All agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women. The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agency, which shall be at least five percent of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relates to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by such agencies. The preparation and submission of annual GAD Plan and annual GAD Accomplishment Report shall be subject to the guidelines issued by the agencies concerned.”



Likewise, Item 4.1 of the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) Memorandum Circular No. 2020-03 states that “All national government agencies and instrumentalities are enjoined to review and revise, as necessary their FY 2020 GPB to implement measures to address gender issues and concerns arising from the unequal status of their women and men stakeholders due to the COVID-19 situation. Such measures should be in line with their respective agency mandates, Republic Act No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women and the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.”



The management was not able to implement GAD programs, projects and activities during the current year. The reason given was due to the transition being undertaken by the management from HUDCC to DHSUD, a merger with HLURB per RA 11201. The agency was also pre-occupied with the on-going placement/recruitment processes of new personnel, along with the unusual circumstances related to COVID-19 pandemic.



The submission of the GPB is an annual recurring task and the responsibility for its preparation/monitoring should have been addressed even before the transition from HUDCC to DHSUD. Moreover, as indicated in Item 4.1 of the PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2020-03, GAD related activities could be adjusted to address gender issues and concerns arising from the unequal status of their women and men stakeholders due to the COVID-19 situation.



The non-submission of the GPB and GAD AR precluded the Audit Team from conducting timely evaluation and audit of GAD funds.

As a result, the Agency is non-compliant with the provisions or rules related to GAD planning, implementation, and reporting.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned GAD Focal Point System to:



1)	Strictly adhere with the GP of GAA and allocate at least five percent of the agency’s budget for the implementation of GAD programs and projects;



2)	Formulate a feasible GAD plan and maximize utilization of GAD budget to be more responsive in addressing gender issues; and



3)	Regularly evaluate and monitor accomplishments using the identified performance indicators to ascertain that all activities/projects are accomplished per plan, and to revise the plan as warranted by prevailing circumstances, with a clear objective of addressing gender issues and concerns for a more responsive and efficient government operations.





Senior Citizens and Differently-Abled Person



	27.  DHSUD-CO and all Regional Offices except NCR, STR and NMR failed to prepare and formulate specific plans, program and activities that would address the concerns of Senior Citizens (SCs) and Differently-Abled Persons (DAPs) contrary to Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020.  



Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 provides that “All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of SCs and DAPs, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same to their regular activities.”



Section 4.2 of the Joint DBM and DSWD Circular No. 2003-01 dated April 28, 2003 provides that “All government agencies, departments, bureaus, offices, commissions and state universities and colleges shall allocate at least one percent of their respective budget for the implementation of plans, programs, projects, activities and services for older persons and persons with disabilities.”



Verification disclosed that Management failed to prepare and formulate any specific plan, program or project that would address the concerns SCs and DAPs due to the national pandemic and transition period of the Agency. 



However, the management informed that it ensures safety of its employees especially SCs and DAPs by providing transport service during the pandemic period, the building has ramps and elevators for their convenience, stand-by wheelchair and free basic medicines in emergency cases.



SCs and DAPs need government protection that they may be provided with opportunities so as not to hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.  Every agency in the government should continue to set aside resources that will address their needs which include areas such as accessibility, personal mobility, health, education, employment, rehabilitation, participation in political life, equality and non-discrimination.



Failure of the Agency to allocate funds and implement programs and projects intended to address the concerns of SCs and DAPs is contrary to Section 32 of the GAA for FY 2020 and Joint DBM and DSWD Circular No. 2003-01 dated April 4, 2003, thus, depriving the intended beneficiaries of the rights and privileges arising therefrom.

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct all the concerned officials to prepare and formulate plans, programs and projects intended for SCs and DAPs in order to address their concerns and integrate the same in their regular activities as required in the abovementioned rules and regulation.
