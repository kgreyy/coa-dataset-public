EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)	Introduction



Republic Act (RA) No. 11201, otherwise known as “An Act Creating the Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development (DHSUD). Defining its Mandate, Powers and Functions, and Appropriating Funds Therefor” was signed on February 14, 2019 by President Rodrigo Roa Duterte..  By virtue of this law, through the consolidation of Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) and the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), the DHSUD was created.

	

The Department shall act as the primary national government entity responsible for the management of housing, human settlement and urban development. It shall be the sole and main planning and policy-making, regulatory, program coordination, and performance monitoring entity for all housing, human settlement and urban development concerns, primarily focusing on the access to and the affordability of basic human needs. It shall develop and adopt a national strategy to immediately address the provision of adequate and affordable housing to all Filipinos, and shall ensure the alignment of the policies, programs, and projects of all its attached agencies to facilitate the achievement of this objective.



The Department shall be composed of the Office of the Secretary (OSEC), and the various bureaus, services and regional offices (ROs). The OSEC shall house the Office of the Department Secretary, the Offices of the Undersecretaries, the Offices of the Assistant Secretaries, and their immediate support staff. The Secretary shall also serve as a voting member of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Board, the governing Boards of the Climate Change Commission (CCC), the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), and the National Land Use Committee (NLUC).



The Department has three main bureaus, namely: the Environmental, Land Use and Urban Planning and Development; Housing and Real Estate Development Regulation; and Homeowners Association and Community Development. The bureaus are complemented by eight supporting services — the Internal Audit, Public Assistance, Public Housing and Settlements, Legal, Planning, Administrative, Finance, and Knowledge Management and Information Systems.



The DHSUD also exercises oversight functions over its attached agencies called key shelter agencies (KSAs), namely: the National Housing Authority (NHA), Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) or Pag-IBIG Fund, Social Housing Finance Corporation (SHFC) and National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation (NHMFC) in terms of policy and program coordination, monitoring and evaluation. The Human Settlements Adjudication Commission (HSAC) assumes the adjudication functions of HLURB.

--	Understatement in the Guaranty Deposit account amounting to P349,769.17 due to non-recording of the deposit made by the Agency under Lease Agreement.

F)	Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations



The following are the significant audit observations and recommendations, which were discussed with Management officials concerned during the exit conference on June 10, 2021, details of which are discussed in Part II of this report. Management views and comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate:



1)		In DHSUD-NLR, a total of uncollected fines and penalties of ₱24,998,661.00 for violation of laws and agency’s rules and regulations by the project owners/developers covering the period CYs 2011 to 2020 were not recognized in the agency’s books of accounts, thus, understating the Accounts Receivable, Income and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit).

	

	We recommended and Management agreed to require: (a) the Accounting Section to record in the appropriate account Service fees all uncollected fines and penalties from developers from final and executory orders and to disclose in the notes to financial statement; and (b) the Chief Administrative Officer and the Monitoring and Adjudication Division to strictly monitor the service of writs of execution and appropriate collection of agency’s income.



2)		In DHSUD-CO, prior years’ Fund Transfers (FT) to National Government Agencies (NGAs), Local Government Units (LGUs) and Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) under the Regular Agency (RA) Fund amounting to P8,500,055.04, P11,837,827.00 and P1,871,624.13, respectively, or an aggregate amount of P22,209,506.17 remained unmonitored and unliquidated, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994. Also, P2,636,389.22 or 11.87 percent of prior year’s balance unsettled and outstanding for 10 years or more and no request for write-off pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005.



	We recommended and Management agreed to require: (a) the Department Secretary to create a committee to monitor the Implementing Agency (IAs’) implementation of the projects sourced from fund transfers; (b) the Undersecretary and Assistant Secretary for operations and project implementation to establish a data bank containing information on all projects being implemented by the Department, so monitoring, evaluation, and address problems encountered to improve its implementation, and most of all, to deter non-liquidation of FTs in the future; and (c) the  Accountant to exert extra effort to demand immediate liquidation of FTs to IAs with existing balances and to expedite the evaluation and reconciliation of all overdue accounts which are more than 10 years, if warranted, request for write off.



3)		Failure of the Accountant of DHSUD-SMR to account in the agency books the guaranty deposits made to SSS for the lease of its building resulted to the understatement of the account balance by P349,769.17 in violation of Section 111 of PD No. 1445 thus, may provide inaccurate information to the management for its decision making.



	We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) instruct the Accountant to transfer the Guaranty Deposits account from HSAC to DHSUD Region XI to provide accurate information to management that there is still such amount readily available to satisfy the last month’s rental and for whatever the lessee may be answerable to the Lessor as stipulated in the Contract; and (b) prepare the necessary adjusting accounting entries to record the transferred account.



4)		In DHSUD-SMR, transferred properties were not booked-up in compliance with the law creating the DHSUD and the HSAC thus, resulted in the understatement of Inventories and PPE accounts by P8,345,650.00 of the former as required under Sec. 43 of the IRR and its related provisions.



	We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant to: (a) properly coordinate with the Supply/Property Officer of DHSUD Region XI and secure the inventory of properties and its corresponding Property Acknowlegement Receipt (PAR) issued to DHSUD Region XII and HSAC to determine the actual number and cost of transferred properties to DHSUD and HSAC; and  (b) prepare the adjusting accounting entries to record the transferred properties to fairly present the agency’s financial condition as of a given date.



	

	G.	Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations



		Of the seven audit recommendations contained in the 2019 Annual Audit Report of HUDCC, four were implemented and three were not implemented.  The details are presented in Part III of this report.
