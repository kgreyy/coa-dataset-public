 MACARIO B. OCLARIT,Ph.D.

College President



(All of) Camiguin Polytechnic State College

Balbagon, Mambajao, Camiguin



Dear Chairman Alibin and Dr. Oclarit:



We are pleased to transmit the Annual Audit Report on the audit of the Camiguin Polytechnic State College (CPSC), Balbagon, Mambajao, Camiguin, for Calendar Year 2020 in compliance with Section 2, Article IX-D of the Philippine Constitution and Section 43 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 otherwise known as the “Government Auditing Code of the Philippines”.



The audit was conducted to (a) ascertain the degree of reliance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.



The attached report consists of Part I- Audited Financial Statements, Part II-Observations and Recommendations, Part III- Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations and Part IV-Appendix, which were discussed with the concerned management officials and staff.

						

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions and we believed that it provided a reasonable basis for the audit results.



	The Auditor rendered a modified-qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements due to the following:

	

1)	----media/image4.png----The accuracy and validity of Other Machinery and Equipment,  Other Property, Plant and Equipment, and Other Assets amounting to  ₱6,878,223.08, ₱1,899,360.87, and ₱3,165,905.76, respectively, under Funds 01, 05 and 06 were not reasonably substantiated due to lack of proper classification and distinction of the said accounts contrary to Chapter 3, Government Accounting Manual (GAM)  Vol. III and Sec. 15, Chapter 2, GAM Volume I, thereby resulting to doubtful existence and reliability of the PPE account and affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements.

 

2)	Accounts Payable balance of P 994,835.32 as of November 30, 2020 for Fund 01 was unreliable due to: (a) inclusion of payables that have been long outstanding for more than two (2) years amounting to P 359,517.19 which were not reverted to the Accumulated Surplus/ Deficit, contrary to Sec. 98 of Presidential Decree 1445; (b) inclusion of payables to GSIS amounting to P 103,243.32 which should have been recorded as “Due to GSIS”; and (c) inclusion of payables to the contractor amounting to P 532,074.81 where the project has already been 100% completed as of November 10, 2020, contrary to Sec. 15, Chapter 2, Vol. I of Government Accounting Manual, thus, understating/overstating the affected accounts and the fair presentation of the financial statements. 



3)	Disbursements amounting to P 8,959,106.66 were not supported with complete documentation contrary to Section 4 (6) of Presidential Decree No. 1445, thus, casting doubt on their validity, legality and propriety. 



(Prior Years)



1)	Non-recognition of Depreciation Expense for all PPE accounts under Fund 101 as of November 30, 2018, contrary to Section 27, Chapter 10, Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Vol. I, thus, affecting the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements.



2)	The validity and accuracy of the year-end balance of the PPE accounts amounting to P115.296 million could not be ascertained due to an unreconciled discrepancy of general ledger and the results of the physical inventory of P88.001 million as of year-end. Likewise, the annual inventory report does not conform to Annex 63 of NGAS Volume 2.



The details of the above and other observations and recommendations which were discussed by the audit team with you and other officials in an exit conference on February 18, 2021 are discussed in detail on Part II of the report. 



We request that the recommended measures be implemented and we would appreciate being informed on the actions taken thereon by accomplishing the attached Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation (AAPSI) form, to be submitted to the Audit Team pursuant to Section 89 of RA 11465, the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020.



We appreciate the invaluable support and cooperation extended by the officials and staff of that Agency to the Audit Team during the audit engagement.

D. INDEPENDENTS AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



The Auditor rendered a modified-qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements of Camiguin Polytechnic State College for calendar year ended December 31, 2020, in view of the effects of the exceptions observed in the course of the audit which is discussed in detail on Part II and Part III of this report, as follows:



1.   The accuracy and validity of Other Machinery and Equipment,  Other Property, Plant and Equipment, and Other Assets amounting to  ₱6,878,223.08, ₱1,899,360.87, and ₱3,165,905.76, respectively, under Funds 01, 05 and 06 were not reasonably substantiated due to lack of proper classification and distinction of the said accounts contrary to Chapter 3, Government Accounting Manual (GAM)  Vol. III and Sec. 15, Chapter 2, GAM Volume I, thereby resulting to doubtful existence and reliability of the PPE account and affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements.

(Prior Years)



1)	Non-recognition of Depreciation Expense for all PPE accounts under Fund 101 as of November 30, 2018, contrary to Section 27, Chapter 10, Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Vol. I, thus, affecting the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements.



2)	The validity and accuracy of the year-end balance of the PPE accounts amounting to P115.296 million could not be ascertained due to an unreconciled discrepancy of general ledger and the results of the physical inventory of P88.001 million as of year-end. Likewise, the annual inventory report does not conform to Annex 63 of NGAS Volume 2.



E.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT AUDIT OBSERVATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS



In addition to the aforecited reasons for a qualified opinion, the following were noted:



1)	Accounts Payable balance of P 994,835.32 as of November 30, 2020 for Fund 01 was unreliable due to: (a) inclusion of payables that have been long outstanding for more than two (2) years amounting to P 359,517.19 which were not reverted to the Accumulated Surplus/ Deficit, contrary to Sec. 98 of Presidential Decree 1445; (b) inclusion of payables to GSIS amounting to P 103,243.32 which should have been recorded as “Due to GSIS”; and (c) inclusion of payables to the contractor amounting to P 532,074.81 where the project has already been 100% completed as of November 10, 2020, contrary to Sec. 15, Chapter 2, Vol. I of Government Accounting Manual, thus, understating/overstating the affected accounts and the fair presentation of the financial statements. 



2)	Disbursements amounting to P 8,959,106.66 were not supported with complete documentation contrary to Section 4 (6) of Presidential Decree No. 1445, thus, casting doubt on their validity, legality and propriety.



F.  STATUS OF SETTLEMENT OF TOTAL SUSPENSIONS, DISALLOWANCES AND CHARGES



As of December 31, 2020, the Statement of Audit Suspensions Disallowances and Charges (SASDC) reflected total suspension of P 5,273,954.77 and total disallowances of P4,030,459.91 as shown below:

Attention:  DR. MACARIO B. OCLARIT

	     SUC President II		



Modified-Qualified Opinion



We have audited the financial statements of Camiguin Polytechnic State College (CPSC), which comprise the statement of financial position as at December 31, 2020, and the statement of financial performance, statement of changes in net assets/equity, statement of cash flows and statement of comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.



In our opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the Basis of Modified-Qualified Opinion section of our report, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Camiguin Polytechnic State College (CPSC) as at December 31, 2020, and its financial performance, its cash flows, and its comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs).



Basis for Modified-Qualified Opinion



As discussed in Part II, the following is the significant deficiency:



The accuracy and validity of Other Machinery and Equipment,  Other Property, Plant and Equipment, and Other Assets amounting to  ₱6,878,223.08, ₱1,899,360.87, and ₱3,165,905.76, respectively, under Funds 01, 05 and 06 were not reasonably substantiated due to lack of proper classification and distinction of the said accounts contrary to Chapter 3, Government Accounting Manual (GAM)  Vol. III and Sec. 15, Chapter 2, GAM Volume I, thereby resulting to doubtful existence and reliability of the PPE account and affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements.



We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs).  Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.  We are independent of the agency in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our modified-qualified opinion.



Key Audit Matters



Except for the matter described in the Basis for Modified-Qualified Opinion section, we have determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report.



Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements



Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with IPSASs, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.



Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the College’s financial reporting process.

			

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements



Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

1)	Statement of Compliance and Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements 



The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and comply with the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) issued by the Commission on Audit per COA Resolution No. 2014-003 dated January 24, 2014.



The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, unless stated otherwise. The Statement of Cash Flows is prepared using the direct method.

2)	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



2.1 Basis of accounting



The consolidated financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS). All expenses are recognized when incurred and reported in the financial statements in the period in which it relates. Income is on accrual basis except for transactions where accrual basis is impractical or when other methods are required by law.



2.2 Notice of Cash Allocation is recorded in the Regular Agency books as well as that income/ receipts which the agency is authorized to use.



2.3 Property, Plant and Equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and obsolescence. For assets under construction, the construction period theory was applied for costing purposes. Related expenses incurred during the construction of the project were capitalized and those incurred after the construction formed part of the operating cost. Bonus paid to contractors for early completing the work was added to the total cost of the project and those projects where liquidated damages charged and paid for by the contractor was deducted from the project cost.



2.4 The straight Line Method of depreciation is used in depreciating the property, Plant and   Equipment with estimated useful lives ranging from five to twenty-five years. A residual value computed at 10 percent of the cost of asset is set and depreciation starts on the second month after purchase.



	1)	Payable accounts are recognized and recorded in the books of accounts only upon delivery of the goods/inventory/ other assets and rendition of services to the agency.



	2)	The Modified Obligation System is used to record allotments recognized and obligation incurred. Separate registries are maintained to control allotments and obligations for each class of allotment.



	3)	Petty cash fund account is maintained under the Imprest system. All replenishments are directly charged to the expense account. The PCF is not used to purchase regular inventory items for stock.



	4)	Payable accounts are recognized and recorded in the books of accounts only upon acceptance of the goods/ inventory/ other assets and rendition of services to the agency.



	5)	Accounts were reclassified to conform with new Revised Chart of Accounts for National Government Agencies as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2013-002 dated January 30, 2013; otherwise known as the Adoption of the Revised Chart of Accounts for Nation Government Agencies which takes effect on January 1, 2014.

4)	Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE)

This account includes the tangible assets utilized by the College in providing services to its stakeholders and in realizing its academe mandate expected be used during more than reporting period.



There was an increase in School Building account due to the physical count conducted by the inventory committee. Also, a reclassification was being made on the Office Equipment account-Firefighting Equipment, Technical and Scientific Equipment and Other Property, Plant and Equipment account was debited and Office Equipment was credited.



	1)	Recognition

The College recognizes a PPE when an item has the following characteristics such as: tangible items; are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes; and are expected to be used during more than one reporting period



Furthermore, when an item depicts that a probable future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to the entity, and the cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably; then, the College identifies that item as a PPE account.



The management measures an item of PPE initially at cost and depreciates separately each item included therein. The cost of the PPE is the cash price equivalent or, for PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction its cost is its fair value as at recognition date. The cost includes the following:



--	Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates;

--	expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items; and

--	initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired, or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that period.



                       6.1.1 Measurement after Recognition



The PPE of the College are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. When significant parts of the PPE are required to be replaced at intervals, the College recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major repair/replacement is done, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense in surplus or deficit as incurred. 



		1)	Depreciation

Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. It is computed using the Straight Line Method over its useful life unless another method is more appropriate for agency operation. The College uses the Schedule on the Estimated Life of PPE by classification taken from the COA manual on the NGAS for NGAs and a residual value equivalent to equivalent to at least five percent (5%) but not more than ten percent (10%) of the cost of the PPE.



		2)	Breakdown on the PPE

The PPE of the College strictly adhere to the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) in the accounting treatment, recognition, measurement, derecognition ensuring the proper valuation and recording.  Table 6.2 bares the summary of the College’s PPE.

2)	Non-Cash Expenses

	These expenses include the systematic allocation of the College’s depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life, otherwise known as depreciation. The College determines the depreciable amount of an asset after deducting its residual value equaled to at least five percent (5%) but not greater than ten percent (10%) of the total cost of an asset. Depreciation begins when an asset is available for use and shall be for one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month. However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, depreciation shall be for the succeeding month.

The accuracy and validity of Other Machinery and Equipment,  Other Property, Plant and Equipment, and Other Assets amounting to  ₱6,878,223.08, ₱1,899,360.87, and ₱3,165,905.76, respectively, under Funds 01, 05 and 06 were not reasonably substantiated due to lack of proper classification and distinction of the said accounts contrary to Chapter 3, Government Accounting Manual (GAM)  Vol. III and Sec. 15, Chapter 2, GAM Volume I, thereby resulting to doubtful existence and reliability of the PPE account and affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements.



Chapter 3, GAM Vol. III, provides the description of the Revised Chart of Accounts. Specifically, accounts “Other Machinery and Equipment”, “Other Property, Plant and Equipment” and “Other Assets” are defined as follows:  



“Other Machinery and Equipment - This account is used to recognize the cost incurred in the purchase or assembly or fair value, if acquired through donation or transfers without cost, of other equipment, not otherwise classified under the specific equipment accounts. Credit this account for derecognition of the carrying amount of the replaced parts in major repairs, or disposal.”



“Other Property, Plant and Equipment - This account is used to recognized the cost of acquisition or fair value, if acquired through donation or transfers without cost, of other property, plant and equipment not falling under any of the specific Property, Plant and Equipment account. Credit this account for derecognition of the carrying amount of the replaced parts in major repairs, or disposal.”



“Other Assets - This account is used to recognize assets not falling under any of the specific asset account. Credit this account for disposal or reclassification to specific asset accounts.”



On the other hand, Sec 15, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM):



“Sec. 15 Fair Presentation. The FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful presentation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSAS. The application of PPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.” 



Our review of the Property Plant and Equipment Account disclosed that both the Accounting and Supply Offices failed to systematically identify the assets to be appropriately categorized under Other Machinery and Equipment, Other Property Plant and Equipment and Other Assets accounts. Moreover, they were unable to draw proper distinction of when to recognize the respective assets. Details are shown below:

Interview with the former accountant, now designated as the Chief Administrative Officer, disclosed that the Accounting Unit simply relied on the account titles and account codes used by the Budget Officer as stated in the Obligation Request Form.  Despite the creation of an inventory committee, the College did not conduct an annual physical inventory of all equipments.  Thus, no lapsing schedule was accordingly prepared.



As a result, the reliability, existence and proper valuation of these PPE accounts are doubtful, and thereby affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements.



We recommended that management shall undertake the following measures:



a)	Conduct annual physical count of property, plant and equipment (PPE) owned by the State College for proper identification and recording, and to ascertain its existence and appropriate valuation;

 

b)	Prepare lapsing schedule of PPE; 



c)	Prepare adjusting Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs); and



d)	Strictly adhere to the provisions of Chapter 3, GAM Vol. III and Sec. 15, Chapter 2, GAM Vol. I.	

	

Management Comment:



		The College President instructed the members of the Inventory Committee to conduct annual physical count of property, plant and equipment owned by the College for proper identification and recording, and to ascertain its existence and appropriate valuation.  As soon as the physical count is conducted, the concerned offices will be required to prepare a lapsing schedule of PPE and accordingly, prepare the necessary adjusting journal entries as well as to strictly adhere to the provisions of Chapter 3, GAM Vol. III and Sec. 15, Chapter 2, GAM Vol. I. 

	

	Audit Rejoinder:

	

	During the virtual exit conference, the Supervising Auditor informed the management of the One-Time Cleansing of PPE Account Balances as covered by COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020.  For this purpose, an Inventory Committee shall include a representative from the Commission on Audit (COA).  This being so, the previously approved office order of the College on the creation of an Inventory Committee will have to be amended.  The schedule for the conduct of physical inventory-taking is already proposed for approval by the College President.



2.    Accounts Payable balance of P 994,835.32 as of November 30, 2020 for Fund 01 was unreliable due to: (a) inclusion of payables that have been long outstanding for more than two (2) years amounting to P 359,517.19 which were not reverted to the Accumulated Surplus/ Deficit, contrary to Sec. 98 of Presidential Decree 1445; (b) inclusion of payables to GSIS amounting to P 103,243.32 which should have been recorded as “Due to GSIS”; and (c) inclusion of payables to the contractor amounting to P 532,074.81 where the project has already been 100% completed as of November 10, 2020, contrary to Sec. 15, Chapter 2, Vol. I of Government Accounting Manual, thus, understating/ overstating the affected accounts and the fair presentation of the financial statements. 



Sec. 98 of PD 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines states that: 

 

“Reversion of Unliquidated balances of Accounts Payable.  – The Commission, upon notice to the head of the agency concerned, may revert to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund of the national government, any unliquidated balance of accounts payable in the books of the national government, which has been outstanding for two years or more and against which no actual claim, administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by perfected contracts on record.  xxx”



Section 15, Chapter 2, Volume I of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) states that:



“Sec. 15. Fair Presentation. The FS shall present fairly the financial position,              financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSAS. The application of PPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.”

	 

Review of the agency’s Aging of Accounts Payable account as of November 30, 2020 for Fund 01 disclosed the following details: 













Name of Creditor



Age of the Account

Amount

Woodland

      > 2 years

P       359,517.19

GSIS

≤ 1 year

   103,243.32

Japuz-Jansol Enterprises

≤ 1 year

   532,074.81

TOTAL

P       994,835.32



The non-reversion by the College Accountant of the amounts payable to Woodland, which has existed in the books for more than two (2) years already, to the Accumulated Surplus/ Deficit account is inconsistent with the guidelines set forth in Sec. 98 of PD 1445.



	On the other hand, the accountant should have adopted the use of the account “Due to GSIS” to recognize amounts due for remittance to GSIS instead of Accounts Payable.  Consistent with the GSIS Act of 1997 on deductions and remittances of contributions & GSIS loans amortization, these amounts should have long been remitted to the said institution to avoid penalties.



	Further, the final payment for the 100% completion of the newly-constructed multi-purpose building at CPSC Catarman campus on November 10, 2020 derecognizes the payables to the contractor (Japuz-Jansol Enterprises).  Verification of disbursement vouchers disclosed that all progress billings were debited to the account “Construction in Progress”.

	

	As a result, the balances of the affected accounts were under/overstated, hence, the financial statements do not give a true and fair view of the agency’s results.    



We recommended that management undertake the following:



1)	Comply with the guidelines set forth in Sec. 98 of PD 1445 and GSIS Act of 1997 as follows:



a)	Conduct extensive review and analyze the recorded payable accounts that remained outstanding for two (2) years or more, as well as the amounts payable for GSIS;



b)	Prepare the necessary adjusting Journal Entry Vouchers (JEV); and



2)	Direct the Accountant to prepare adjusting JEVs, derecognizing the Accounts Payable to the contractor of the newly-completed project at CPSC Catarman Campus.





Management Comment:

	

	Adjusting entries were prepared to revert the unliquidated balance of accounts payable which has been outstanding for more than two (2) years and derecognize the accounts payable pertaining to GSIS and to the completed project at the Catarman campus.  

	

	

	 

	Audit Rejoinder:

	

More than the preparation of the adjusting entries, the team queried on the nature of the GSIS payable amounts as well as the amount payable to Woodland.  The former accountant (now designated as the College Chief Administrative Officer) stated that the GSIS payables pertain to the payment of salary differentials of various College officials and employees.  She further informed the team that the amounts were already remitted in December, 2020.  On the other hand, the College has yet to determine the nature of the payables to Woodland and if the same was recorded as receivable by the latter.  The College committed to apprise the team of this matter on February 22, 2021.  



3.    Disbursements amounting to P 8,959,106.66 were not supported with complete documentation contrary to Section 4 (6) of Presidential Decree No. 1445, thus, casting doubt on their validity, legality and propriety.



Section 4 (6) of Presidential Decree No. 1445 or the State Audit Code of the Philippines provides that claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.



Review of the disbursement vouchers, disclosed that the College disbursed funds for the payment of goods, meals, wages, fuel, petty cash replenishment and  infrastructure project totaling P 8,959,106.66, despite incomplete documentation as shown in     Appendix A. The transactions listed therein were just some of the disbursements that had insufficient documents. The deficiencies noted were the basic requirements in disbursements that establish the validity and compliance to laws, rules and regulations of the claim for payment.



Failure to properly review and scrutinize the completeness of the required supporting documents has led to the deficiencies noted. Even the most basic documents that should have accompanied the disbursement vouchers were not attached thereto.



The absence of complete documentation affects the validity, legality and propriety of the transactions.  



We recommended that Management:



a)	Direct the Accountant to submit to the Office of the Auditor the required supporting documents as listed in Annex A for evaluation; and



b)	Adhere strictly to Section 4 (6) of Presidential Decree No. 1445, otherwise known as the State Auditing Code of the Philippines. 



Management Comment:



In a letter dated February 1, 2021, the management rendered partial compliance on the disbursement vouchers (DVs) with incomplete documentation.  The College further committed to follow the submission of other DVs with lacking signatures of the concerned officials and/ or employees. 





Audit Rejoinder:



During the virtual exit conference, the team reminded the College to expedite the submission and compliance of the lacking documents to prevent the issuance of suspensions.

CPSC allocated P 5,918,200.00 representing 5% of the CY 2020 Annual Budget of                 P 85,232,593.00 for GAD related activities.

    PART III – STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION

    OF PRIORYEARS’ AUDIT

		    RECOMMENDATIONS

STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF PRIOR YEARS’ AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS



As of December 31, 2020, of the twenty-five (25) audit recommendations in CY 2019, 2018 and 2017 Annual Audit Reports, only one (1) was fully implemented and twenty-four (24) are not implemented.



Audit Observations

Recommendations

Auditor’s Validation Result

1)	OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



1)	The reported carrying amount of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) of    P 154,066,205 was doubtful due to (a) material variances of recorded amount of Accumulated Depreciation and Depreciation Expense accounts totaling P6,817,525.00, (b) unreconciled costs of various PPE accounts as reported by the Accounting and Supply Units totaling P154,967,363.89, and (c) inclusion of semi-expendable properties amounting to P6,929,539.46, contrary to Sec. 6, Chapter 19; Sec. 42, Chapter 10; and Sec. 10, Chapter 8, all of Volume I of Government Accounting Manual, rendering the account balances unreliable.



1.Require the Accountant to trace the transactions that caused the variances of Depreciation Expenses and Accumulated Depreciation accounts and prepare journal entry voucher for the necessary adjustments; and















2)	Enjoin the Accountant and the Head of the Supply Unit to reconcile their respective records/reports on PPE and to reclassify all semi-expendable properties which were included/recognized as PPE.



NOT IMPLEMENTED



While the College has submitted the Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) for the adjustments, the amounts in the JEVs were not duly supported with computations, hence the team could not validate further.  The new accountant also has to trace back on the computation of amounts indicated in the JEVs prepared by the former bookkeeper.  





NOT IMPLEMENTED



For CY 2020, no Report of Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) was submitted due to absence of physical inventory-taking.  The CY 2019 RPCPPE only showed the PPE by type (e.g. office equipment) without indicating the detailed technical specifications of the equipments.  Hence, the proper recognition and identification of the equipments cannot be conducted.  For semi-expendable equipments, the team can only rely so much on the unit cost of the item (to not exceed      P 15,000) inorder to be classified in this category without knowing the specific identification and other details of the items.

   



2. Dr.Cerenia B. Galagar still performs as Acting Collecting Officer and Petty Cash Fund Custodian despite the designation of Ms. Marilou E. Palmere as the new Finance Officer due to the absence of Fidelity Bond of the latter, thus, affecting internal control system of the campus caused by non-segregation of duties and functions.





3)	Direct the responsible officer to immediately process the fidelity bond of Ms. Marilou E. Palmere for the latter to discharge fully her duties and responsibilities as designated Finance Officer; and

















4)	Designate a permanent employee who will perform as Finance Officer on a full-time basis to properly safeguard cash and 

accountable forms.





FULLY IMPLEMENTED



In lieu of Ms. Marilou E. Palmere, the College designated Dr. Nena V. Siaboc, as the Finance Officer and Petty Cash Custodian of CPSC Catarman per Office Order No. 07-2020 dated June 17, 2020.  The accountable officer is also duly bonded, the coverage of her approved bond is from October 9, 2020 to October 8, 2021. 





NOT IMPLEMENTED



The same Office Order also designated Dr. Siaboc as the Dean of Institute of Agriculture, hence, her designation as the Finance Officer is not on a full-time basis. 

2018 OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



3)	Non-recognition of Depreciation Expense for all PPE accounts under Fund 101 as of November 30, 2018, contrary to Section 27, Chapter 10, Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Vol. I, thus, affecting the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements.



1)		Prepare and submit a schedule of all PPE acquired from Fund 101, providing information on the acquisition date of the asset, estimated useful life, acquisition/ contract cost and other relevant data; 



2)	Compute the understatement in depreciation expense and prepare adjusting entries to record the proper valuation of the depreciation, accumulated depreciation and accumulated surplus/deficit accounts; and



3)		Continuously reconcile the result of the physical count with the property and accounting records. 

	

	NOT IMPLEMENTED

	

	Since CY 2018, No PPE lapsing schedule was submitted containing the details of all PPEs. 

	

	

	

	

	

	NOT IMPLEMENTED

	

	No reconciliation of PPE records between the Supply Unit and Accounting Units was conducted, thus, the adjustments could not be made.

	

	

	

	

	NOT IMPLEMENTED

	

	The College did not also conduct the annual physical inventory-taking of all PPEs

	

	2. a. Cash Advances amounting to                    P 696,074.50 remain unliquidated as of December 31, 2018 contrary to Paragraph 5.1 of COA Circular 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, thus exposing the government funds to risk of loss and misappropriation; and 















a)		Cash Advances were granted to officials and employees with pending unliquidated cash advances contrary to Section 89 of PD 1445, resulting to accumulation of huge unliquidated cash advances as of December 31, 2018. 





1)	Enforce liquidation of cash advances in accordance with the provisions of COA Circular 97-002 dated February 10, 1997.  The concerned officials and employees with unliquidated cash advances shall effect immediate settlement of the same otherwise the necessary sanctions for its settlement such as the withholding of the salary be applied to the unliquidated cash advances; and 





2)	Enforce strictly the provision of Section 89 of PD 1445 and require the concerned officials and employees with unliquidated cash advances to immediately settle the same, otherwise, effect the withholding of their salaries to apply to their unsettled accountabilities.



	NOT IMPLEMENTED

	

	The report on Unliquidated Cash Advances as of November 30, 2020, which amounted to            P 818,974.86                   (P 391,737.28 for CY 2018 and prior years and P 427,237.58 for CY 2019 and CY 2020), still showed the names of officials and employees and their respective unliquidated cash advance balances for over 1 year.  

	

	

	NOT IMPLEMENTED

	

	We have issued Notice of Suspensions (NS) for unliquidated cash advances in CY 2018 due to inaction of the management to strictly enforce the liquidations.  As of December 31, 2020, no settlement has been made by the accountable officials and employees of the College.  

	For CY 2019 and CY 2020, retrieval of vouchers supporting the unliquidated cash advances is underway.  The issuance of NS shall follow. 

	

3)	Payment of salaries and wages of the regular employees and contact of services (COS) were still made through Cash Advances despite the implementation of Expanded Modified Direct Payment Scheme of the College, contrary to DBM Circular Letter No. 2013-16, thus, exposing the agency to risks of defalcation and misapplication of funds.



1)	Require all service providers to open a land bank account;









2)	Require the Cashier to direct payments of salaries and wages and employee benefits thru ADA; and











	

3)		Strictly observe the provisions of DBM CL 2013-16, including its addendum.

	NOT IMPLEMENTED

	

	A number of service providers were still paid thru check.

	

	

	NOT IMPLEMENTED

	

	While the regular employees were already paid thru ATM, the wages of JOs and part time lecturers were still paid thru cash advance drawn against the name of cashier.

	

	

	NOT IMPLEMENTED

2017 OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



1)	Members of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC), Technical Working Group (TWG) and BAC Secretariat were paid honoraria amounting to P164,500.00 in excess of the rates provided in DBM Budget Circular No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005.

a)	Require the personnel involved to refund the excess payment made to them; and





b)	Strictly adhere to the guidelines on the payment of Honoraria to personnel involved in the procurement as set forth in DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-3 dated November 29, 2007, Especially the maximum allowable rate.

NOT IMPLEMENTED



As of December 31, 2020, no refunds or settlements were made.  



NOT IMPLEMENTED

Management previously committed that full restitution shall be implemented in March, 2019, however, no refunds or settlements were made as of December 31, 2020.



2)	The validity and accuracy of the year-end balance of the PPE accounts amounting to P115.296 million could not be ascertained due to an unreconciled discrepancy of general ledger and the results of the physical inventory of P88.001 million as of year-end. Likewise, the annual inventory report does not conform to Annex 63 of NGAS Volume 2.



We recommended to the College President through its Vice President for Administration to reconstitute an Inventory Committee responsible for the Physical count of the PPE on a yearly basis, after which the Accounting and Supply Units will reconcile their maintained records.



NOT IMPLEMENTED

	

	For CY 2020, the team was not provided with a copy of the reconstitution/ composition of the Inventory Committee.  Further, the College did not also conduct the annual physical inventory-taking of all PPEs, hence, reconciliation of PPE records between the Supply Unit and Accounting Units was not conducted.
