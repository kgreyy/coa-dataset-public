PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

Financial Audit 

 

Accounting Errors and Omissions 

 

1. Various accounts of the Industrial Technology Development Institute (ITDI) 
have misstatements overstating its total Assets, Liabilities and Equity accounts by 

P1,816,159.97, P1,073,937.27 and P6,377,808.77, respectively, which represents 0.09 

percent of total assets, 0.12 percent of total liabilities and 0.61 percent of the net 

assets/equity of the Institute.  

 

2. Paragraph 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 
1states that financial statements shall present fairly, among others, the financial position 

and performance of an entity.  Fair presentation requires the faithful presentation of the 

effects of the transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions 

and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs. 

 

3. Section 111 of PD 1445 requires that the accounts of an agency shall be kept in 
such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate 

to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. It further 

states that the highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed 

in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. 

 

4. In our audit of the Agency’s accounts, we noted the following misstatements which 
were not adjusted by Management as at year-end:

under Reporting Phase - Item 4.3, COA Resolution No. 2019-016 dated 25 June 2019, re: "Determining and Using Materiality 
Thresholds in Financial Audit" 

 

a) The accuracy of accounts Cash in Bank-LCCA and Cash-Modified 
Disbursement System (MDS), Trust maintained by ITDI were doubtful since 

reconciling items were not adjusted, contrary to Sections 3 and 6, Chapter 21 

of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government 

Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, thus affecting the fair presentation of the cash and 

liability accounts in the financial statements. 

 

5. Section 3, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I states that “The Bank 
Reconciliation Statement (BRS) shall be prepared in order to:  

 

a. check correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s/entity’s records,  
b. serve as a deterrent to fraud, and  
c. enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or credits recognized 

by the bank or agency/entity but not yet known to the agency/entity or bank. 

 

This shall be used in the reconciliation of bank and treasury accounts maintained 

with Government Servicing Bank (GSB). 

 

6. Furthermore, Section 6 of the same Chapter states that “The Chief 
Accountant/Designated Staff shall prepare a JEV to recognize all reconciling items that 

require adjustment and correction in the books of accounts.” 

 

7. Verification of Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) for Cash-in Bank-LCCA, a 
Trust account maintained at Land Bank of the Philippines intended for ITDI-Training and 

Cash-MDS, Trust, revealed that there were reconciling items as at December 31, 2020, 

which were not adjusted in the books of ITDI as follows:

8. The unrecorded stale checks were checks issued on October 2, 2020, and already 
staled on December 02, 2020, as prescribed by Treasury Circular 03-2017 dated October 

20, 2017, “Reduction in the expiry period of MDS Check from six (6) months to three (3) 

months from date of issue.” 
 

9. Direct Deposits are payments made by clientele of ITDI through bank for the 
services provided such as testing and calibration, test analysis and Research and 

Development (R&D) analysis. 

 

10. Debit Memos represent charges of duties and taxes by the Bureau of Customs 
(BOC) through electronic mobile system debited by the banks. However, the Accounting 

Office could not prepare the Journal Entry Vouchers (JEV) unless billing statements, 

assessments forms and other documents supporting the transaction will be submitted to 

them.  

 

11. The Property Officer had already requested the BOC but was informed that said 
documents were submitted to the Bank. When the Property Officer inquired from the Bank 

personnel, she was informed that the documents were already sent to the ITDI Accounting 

Office; hence, up to now the Debit Memos remained questionable and unrecorded because 

of the absence of documents.  

 

12. Prior to these, ITDI had also experienced BOC charges paid by the Bank, but it did 
not actually belong to the agency but to other clients. 

 

13. The failure to record the adjustments for the reconciling items understated the 
presentation of the cash, liabilities and income accounts in the amount of P214,676.81, 

P188,192.01 and P26,484.80, respectively, in the year-end financial statements and 

contrary to the aforementioned provisions. 

 

 

 



45 
 

14. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Request the Bank to provide documents or any evidence as their basis 
in issuing the Debit Memos amounting to P58,518.88; 

 

b. Request the Bank Manager to, hence forth, confirm first with the ITDI 
Property Officer before paying any BOC charges to the forwarders, in 

order to validate the transaction; 

 
c. Require the Property Officer to exert effort to analyze possible 

transactions requiring payments to forwarders; and 

 

d. Require the Chief Accountant to: (i) validate the supporting documents 
representing Debit Memos when these are submitted to them by the 

bank; and (ii) prepare the necessary adjustments for the unrecorded 

reconciling items in the books of accounts.  

 

15. Management informed the Audit Team, that they already emailed their request to 
the Bank Manager for the confirmation of BOC charges before paying the forwarders and 

submitted all the documents such as Debit Memos, JEVs and other supporting documents 

subject for audit validation. 

 

b) The non-recording of loss of equipment overstated the PPE account of the agency 
in the amount of P1,089,000.00 due to failure of the Accountable Officer to file 

request for relief from property accountability, contrary to Section 41, Chapter 

10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I 

 

16. Section 41, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides the accounting 
policies on loss of property as follows:  

 

a. When a loss of government funds or property occurs while they are in 
transit or the loss is caused by fire, theft, or other casualty or force 

majeure, the officer accountable therefor or having custody thereof shall 

immediately notify the Commission or the auditor concerned and, within 

thirty days or such longer period as the Commission or auditor may in the 

particular case allow, shall present his application for relief, with the 

available supporting evidence. Whenever warranted by the evidence credit 

for the loss shall be allowed. An officer who fails to comply with this 

requirement shall not be relieved of liability or allowed credit for any loss 

in the settlement of his accounts. (Sec. 73, P.D. No. 1445)  

 

b. Lost property and the related accumulated depreciation and impairment 
loss shall be derecognized in the books upon receipt of the Report of Lost, 

Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) (Appendix 75) 

supported by a Notice of Loss prepared and submitted by the Accountable 

Officer. The loss shall be charged to account “Loss of Assets” at an 

amount equal to its carrying amount. 



46 
 

 

c. The accountability of the accountable officer over the loss of depreciable 
asset shall be based on depreciated replacement cost (DRC) PPSAS 21 

par. 45. DRC is replacement cost less accumulated depreciation 

calculated on the basis of replacement cost 

 

17. Early in March 2020, the ITDI shipped the items enumerated in Table 3 to the National 
Metrology Institute of Malaysia for calibration. However, Mr. Jessie G. Yap, the 

Accountable Officer (AO) was notified through email from the freight forwarder 

Schenker Philippines, Inc. that the cargo was declared missing after 120 days of 

investigation and searching.

 Total 1,089,000.00 

 

18. Verification of the general ledger revealed that the loss of equipment and 
accountability of the AO was not recorded due to non-submission of the AO’s request for 

relief from property accountability; hence, overstating the PPE account, and understating 

the Due from Officers and Employees and Other Deferred Credit accounts of the agency 

by P768,707.50 (i.e., total cost of the PPE of P1,089,000.00 less the accumulated 

depreciation of P320,292.50). 
 

19. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Accountable Officer concerned to immediately file his application for 
relief from property accountability and submit all the supporting 

documents; and 

 

b. The Chief Accountant to record the loss of equipment and recognize the 
accountability of the Accountable Officer once the result of the filed relief 

from accountability is issued. 

 

20. The Accountable Officer already submitted his letter-request for relief from 
property accountability, together with the supporting documents, subject for evaluation in 

audit. 



47 
 

 

c) Erroneous charging of expenses not classified under Other Professional 
Service Expense for CY 2020 amounting to P5,524,416.47 misstated the 

account and other affected expense accounts, contrary to Volume III of the 

GAM for NGAs. 

 

21. Volume III of the GAM for NGAs, on the Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 
2019), provides the description of accounts, as follows:

22. Verification and analysis of the account Other Professional Service Expenses 
showed the following transactions which were not in consonance with Volume III of the 

GAM for NGAs.

23. The improper or erroneous recording of the above transactions misstated the Other 
Professional Service Expense account in the aggregate amount of P5,524,416.47 on a 

monthly reporting. Although the above-mentioned transactions were already reclassified 

to Due to NGAs account since these were Grants-in-Aid (GIA) Fund, proper classification 

in recording the transactions should be observed. 

 

24. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
record the transactions in accordance with the account definitions prescribed in 

Volume III of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government 

Agencies.   

 

25. Management commented that they will strictly implement our recommendation in 
recording all transactions in accordance with the definitions prescribed in Volume III of 

the GAM for NGAs. Likewise, the Chart of Accounts for Object Code in the United 

Accounts Code Structure (UACS) will be followed. 

 

26. The non-recording of cash reconciling items and the loss of equipment as well as 
the misclassification of expense accounts resulted in the understatement of Cash, 

overstatement of PPE, and under/overstatement of Expense accounts at year-end in the FS 

of the Agency. 
 

27. In summary, the total misstatements which were not adjusted during the audit 
period amounting to P1,816,159.97, P1,073,937.27 and P6,377,808.77, represent only 0.09 

percent of the total assets, 0.12 percent of the total liabilities, and 0.61 percent of the net 



50 
 

assets/equity, respectively, of the Institute. Hence, due to the insignificant impact of the 

misstatements on the financial statements, we rendered an Unqualified Opinion on the 

financial statements of the ITDI as at year-end. 

 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

28. Deficiencies totaling P38,766,425.86 were noted in the recording and reporting of 
financial transactions which affected the reliability and accuracy of the reported balances 

of the FSs of the Institute. The details are shown in Table 5:

Deficiencies on Accounts Payable 

 

a) The reported Accounts Payable shown in the Statement of Financial Position and 
Aging Schedule of Accounts Payable as at December 31, 2020, amounting to 

P90,485,679.52 did not reconcile with the Budget report on the Due and 

Demandable obligations of P81,654,081.13 in the Aging Schedule of Unpaid 

Obligation of FAR No. 3 and FAR No.1 with reported difference of P8,831,598.39 

or a variance of P38,451,434.29; thus, casting doubt as to correct balances of 

unpaid obligations as at year-end.        

 

29. Accounts payable is defined as valid and legal obligations of the National 
Government Agencies (NGAs) Operating Units (OUs), for which goods/ services/projects 

have been delivered/rendered/completed and accepted, regardless of the year these 

obligations were incurred. 

 

30. Section 6.a, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states that: “Each entity 
shall recognize and present its financial transactions and operations conformably to the 



51 
 

following: a. generally accepted government accounting principles in accordance with 

PPSAS and pertinent laws, rules and regulations; xxx.” 

 

31. Verification of the Statement of Financial Position as at December 31, 2020 
revealed total Accounts Payable comprised of current and non-current liabilities in the total 

amount of P90,485,679.52. This was supported by the Schedule of Aging of Accounts 

Payables by the same amount.  Both records are prepared and reported by the Accounting 

Office. 

 

32. In parallel review, the submitted Aging Schedule of Due and Demandable 
Obligations-Financial Accountability Report No. 3 (FAR No. 3) as at December 31, 2020, 

by Budget Office, showed unpaid obligations totaling P81,654,051.13, resulting in 

difference of P8,831,628.39 or a variance/deficiency of P38,451,434.29. (See Tables 6 and 

7.)

33. The reported material discrepancies between the Accounting and Budget Offices 
cast doubts on the accuracy of unpaid obligations as at year-end.  

 

34. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant 
and the Budget Officer to reconcile their respective records, submit 

justification/explanation for the cause of variance, if any, and effect the corrections, 

if necessary. 

 



52 
 

35. Management commented that due to voluminous unpaid obligations as at 
December 31, 2020, some were overlooked and were not included in the Financial 

Accountability Reports (FARs 1 and 3). They likewise, informed the Team that the 

Account and Budget Sections are now in the process of checking these reports to validate 

the reported difference of P8,831,598.39 or variance of P38,451,434.29. As soon as the 

reconciliation process is done, these reports will be revised and submitted immediately to 

the DBM, COA and other oversight agencies. 

 

Deficiencies on Due to BIR  

 

b) The year-end balance of Due to BIR amounting to P4,634,216.17 is doubtful due 
to: (i) items for adjustment, and (ii) items for validation of BIR Audit amounting 

to P266,444.85 and P48,546.72, respectively, thus, affecting the fair presentation 

of the account in the FS. 

 

36. Analysis of the account Due to BIR for CY 2020 showed that the total amount of  
P56,141,905.75 was collected/withheld taxes from salaries and wages, and from 

contractors and suppliers, including prior years’ balance of P10,444,959.30 and remitted 

the amount of P51,507,689.58, leaving an unremitted balance of P4,634,216.17 as at 

December 31, 2020. 

 

37. Aging of balances disclosed that P4,401,657.46 or 94.98% is current and 
P232,558.71 or 5.02% is non-current.

39. The existence of items for adjustment and for validation of BIR Audit amounting 
to P266,444.85 and P48,546.72, respectively, had affected the accuracy of the account Due 

to BIR. 

 

 

 

40. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 
 

a. Trace the nature of the transactions and breakdown of balances or those 
items for adjustment under Due to BIR account to facilitate appropriate 

action; and  

 

b. Expedite remittance of past due balances to BIR. 
 

41. Management commented that P103,606.56 and P128,604.34 were already remitted 
on January 26, 2021 and February 11, 2021, respectively. The remaining P82,780.67 is still 

for adjustment and further verification. They likewise informed the Team that they will 

facilitate the checking and verification of the amount for adjustment and when completed, 

remittance to BIR and/or adjustment in the books shall be done, if necessary. 

 

Compliance Audit 

 

42. Lack of supporting documents on payment of Traveling Expense violated Section 
4, sub-paragraph 6 of Presidential Decree (PD) 1445. 

 

43. Section 4, sub-paragraph 6 of PD 1445, otherwise known as the Government 
Auditing Code of the Philippines, provides that claims against government funds shall be 

supported with complete documentation. 

 

44. COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 specifies, among others, the 
general requirements for all types of disbursements such as legality of transaction and 

conformity with laws, rules or regulations, approval of expenditure by Head of Office or 

his authorized representative and sufficient and relevant documents to establish validity of 

claim. 

 

45. Section 3.a  of Executive Order No. 77 dated March 15, 2019- Authorized Official 
Travel-Official local or foreign travels and assignments under this Order cover only those 

which meet the following criteria: (a) it is essential to the effective performance of an 

official or employee’s mandates or functions; (b) it is required to meet the needs of the 

department, agency bureau or office, or there is substantial benefit to be derived by the 

State;(c) the presence of the official or employee is critical to the outcome of the meeting, 

conference, seminar, consultation or any official activity to be attended; and (d) the 

projected expenses are not excessive or involve minimum expenditure. 

 

46. Section 3.c of the same EO states that the official local travels of government 
personnel for thirty (30) days or more and payment of their corresponding travel expenses 



54 
 

in NGAS shall be approved by Department Secretaries, those of equivalent rank or their 

authorize representative- for personnel in their respective agencies 

 

47. Verification of documents on payment of traveling expense revealed the following 
observations: 

 

        a.1) Non-attachment of Travel Authority from the Department Secretary or his 

representative for travel exceeding 30 days violated Section 3.c of EO No. 

77 

 

48. The Director of the Industrial Technology Development Institute (ITDI) issued a 
travel order (TO) dated February 26, 2020 to five (5) employees to Antique Province in 

order to resume assembly, installation and functional performance testing of prototype kiln 

under the Project: Brick-making Facility for the period covered March 3 to April 3, 2020. 

But due to the declaration of State of Calamity on the entire country, various local 

government units (LGUs) have implemented Community Quarantine in their respective 

area.  The five (5) employees extended their stay in the province and continued their work 

projects, consequently resulting in the issuance of another travel order. See table below for 

details:

49. The total number of days of per diems paid by the agency to its personnel 
accumulated to 101 days including Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays. Several TOs were 

issued by the Director in order not to exceed their one-month authority. 

 

a.2) Non-Attachment of Official Receipt (OR) for payment of reloading 

Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) 

 



55 
 

50. Payment to Citra Metro Manila Tollways Corporation for the reloading of RFID of 
ITDI vehicles amounting to P35,000.00 was not supported with an official receipt, thus 

casting doubt to the validity of transaction. 

 

 

 

51. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Require the five (5) ITDI personnel to secure travel authority from the 
Office of the DOST Secretary in compliance with Section 3.c of EO No. 77; 

and 

 

b. Submit original Official Receipt representing payment of reloading of 
RFID. 

 

52. Management submitted to the Audit Team, DOST Secretary’s affirmation of the 
Travel Orders previously issued by the ITDI Director 
 

53. Propriety of Fuel, Oil and Lubricants Expense for CY 2020 totaling 
P269,648.36 could not be ascertained due to: (a) non-preparation and submission of 

required Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption and Monthly Report of Official 

Travel to the Auditor, (b) improperly accomplished driver’s trip ticket, (c) failure to 

use Requisition and Issue Voucher or equivalent, and (d) irregularities noted in the 

reimbursements for fuel paid through petty cash fund, contrary to the provisions of 

COA Circular No. 77-61 dated September 26, 1977 and COA Circular No. 96-004 

dated April 19, 1996, thus, rendering the accuracy and validity of the expended 

amount doubtful. 

 

54. COA Circular No. 77-61 dated September 26,1977– “Prescribing the use of the 
Manual of Audit for Fuel Consumption of Government Motor Vehicles” cited the 

following: 

 

• Use of government vehicle shall be properly controlled and 
regulated- The use of government motor vehicles should be 

controlled through properly accomplished and duly approved 

Driver’s Trip Ticket. (Appendix A) which should be serially 

numbered, a summary of which shall be made at the end of the 

month in a Monthly Report of Official Travels (Appendix F), for 

audit purposes. 

 

• Fuel consumption of government motor transportation shall be 
properly controlled and accounted for through Requisition and 

Issue Voucher or equivalent (Appendix B) 

 

• Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption of government motor 
transportation (Appendix G) shall be submitted to the Auditor for 

verification purposes to determine the reasonableness of fuel 



56 
 

consumed during the period 

 

• Where cash advances are granted for the purchase of gasoline and 
oil for use of government vehicles, the replenishment must be duly 

supported by properly accomplished driver’s trip ticket. This 

should be duly accomplished by the Chief of the Agency or his/her 

duly authorized representative. The passengers using the vehicle 

should affix their signatures on the trip ticket and indicate the 

purpose of the trip. The duly accomplished requisition and issue 

voucher bearing the plate number of the vehicle utilized with the 

signature of the driver showing that he received the gasoline and oil 

issued. 

 

55. In the course of the audit of Fuel Oil and Lubricant Expense, we noted the 
following: 

 

b.1) Monthly Report of Official Travel and Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption 

were not prepared and submitted to the Auditor 

 

56. Monthly Report of Official Travel and Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption were 
not prepared and submitted to the Auditor, contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 

77-61 dated September 26, 1977, since there was no assigned personnel to prepare the said 

report. Thus, the reasonableness of fuel consumption for the month could not be 

established.  

 

Table 11- Required Forms  

Forms Purpose Distribution of Docs.

report shall be prepared by the

Original – Auditor 
 
Duplicate -File 
 
 

 

 



57 
 

b.2) Driver’s trip tickets were not properly accomplished 

 

57. We further noted that not all the driver’s trip tickets were properly accomplished. 
Only the driver’s trip tickets attached to the disbursement vouchers were properly filled 

up. A check of the file of other trip tickets disclosed that the fuel consumption portion was 

not properly filled up, thus, monitoring of fuel consumption to minimize wasteful, 

excessive and unnecessary expenditure for government vehicles could not be facilitated. 

 

58. Provisions of COA Circular No. 77-61 states that “For the purpose of controlling 
the use of government vehicles, before any trip is undertaken, authority shall first be 

secured from the Head of the Agency or duly authorized representative, authorized to 

approve Driver’s Trip Ticket. The tickets which should be serially numbered shall be 

prepared in two copies to be distributed as follows: 

 

Original - Auditor (through Chief Accountant) for audit purposes 

 Duplicate – File” 

 

b.3) Failure to use Requisition and Issue Voucher (RIV) or equivalent 

 

59. The ITDI uses the Fuel Request Form instead of the Requisition and Issue Voucher, 
however, the necessary information are not indicated in the Fuel Request Form. Provisions 

of COA Circular No. 77-61 states that “Fuel consumption of government motor 

transportation shall be controlled and accounted for through approved Requisition and 

Issue Voucher or equivalent.” 

 

60. The said Circular further states that “When properly accomplished and duly 
approved, the RIV or equivalent shall be the basis of procuring gasoline and oil from the 

gasoline station normally supplying the agency with its fuel needs. The RIV shall be 

accomplished in three copies to be distributed as follows: 

 

Original - Auditor (through Chief Accountant) for audit 

purposes 

Duplicate - Control Officer/ Clerk (Transportation/Motor Pool) 

Triplicate - File of Requisitioning Official” 

 

b.4) Irregularities noted in the reimbursements for fuel paid through petty cash 

fund 

 

61. Section 3.1.1.8 of COA Circular No. 96-004 dated April 19, 1996 states that, “To 
ensure that government funds and property are used only for officials’ purposes, no 

reimbursement of the cost of gasoline and oil shall be allowed a private vehicle is used. 

However, the officials and employees concerned shall be entitled to the reimbursement of 

the equivalent cost of the customary mode of transportation. Under no circumstances 

should fuel be issued to privately owned motor vehicles.” 

 



58 
 

62. Per checking of reimbursements for fuel paid through petty cash fund, we have 
noted the following: 

 

a) There were no trip tickets attached to reimbursements to identify 
the vehicle used. These instances pose the possibility that a private 

vehicle is loaded with fuel at the expense of the agency.

Vehicles noted above with plate nos. AAP 8050 and SHP 204 were not 

included in the list of agency vehicles, thus, violating COA Circular No. 96-

59 
 

Furthermore, RFID E-Load were reimbursed on 1/14,2020 (JEV-2020-02-

000353 CK#994-02-208-20) and 3/30/2020 (JEV-2020-09-001444 CK#994-

09-580-20) amounting to P3,000.00 each but the plate no. of vehicle loaded 

with was not indicated in the Petty Cash Voucher. 

 

c) Incorrect charging of expenses to Fuel, Oil and Lubricants Expenses 
amounting to P827.25 was noted in JEV No. 2020-03-000738 dated March 4, 

2020. This amount should have been charged to Other Supplies and Materials 

Expenses since these were used for the purchase of hand sanitizers and alcohol. 

 

63. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Administrative Division to: 
 

i. Enforce complete and proper accomplishment of driver’s trip 
tickets. To facilitate this, require the officer in-charge to 

orient/teach all drivers in the filling out of entries in the trip tickets 

and in preparing the Monthly Report of Official Travel; 

 

ii. Assign personnel to be in-charge of the preparation of the Monthly 
Report of Official Travel and Monthly Report of Fuel 

Consumption and ensure submission thereof to the Office of the 

Auditor; 

 

iii. Use the RIV instead of the Fuel Request form to properly control 
and account fuel consumption; and 

 

iv. Submit justification with supporting documents for the use of 
vehicles not included in the agency vehicles; and 

 

b. The Accounting/Finance Management Division to: 
 

i. Instruct Petty Cash Custodians to check complete supporting 
documents for the reimbursement of fuel expenses to ensure that 

the fuel is loaded only into the authorized agency vehicles; and 

 

ii. Prepare necessary adjustment for the incorrect charging to Fuel, 
Oil and Lubricant Expenses. 

 

64. Management commented as follows: 

 

Administrative Division 

 

a. The Monthly Report of Official Travel and Monthly Report of Fuel 

Consumption will be submitted to the Office of the Auditor every end of the 



60 
 

month effective immediately. Administrative Officers were assigned in the 

preparation of the said reports; 

 

b. They will ensure that trip tickets are properly accomplished everyday by the 

respective drivers; 

  

c. They are using Purchase Request in lieu of the RIV to support the request for 

fuel/gasoline. The PR is attached to the Disbursement Voucher as one of the 

supporting documents for payment of gasoline/fuel consumption of the 

Institute. The Fuel Request Form is used as an authorization of the driver to 

be presented to the gasoline station before filling up of gasoline to the official 

vehicle. This is part of the credit line agreement between ITDI and Caltex, 

represented by Villarta-Maglaya Trading Inc.; and 

 

d. Justification for the use of vehicles not included in the list of agency vehicles 

will be submitted. The vehicles are exclusively used in the implementation of 

DOST-GIA Projects and expenses related to the vehicle maintenance were 

charged to the DOST-GIA projects; 

 

Accounting /Finance Management Division 

 

e. Replenishment of PCF will be strictly monitored and reviewed to ensure that 

fuel expense is not included. Charging of fuel expense will not also be 

included in the purpose of PCF; and 

 

f. Correct charging of expenses shall be followed. 

 

Other Compliance Issues 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

65. The ITDI allocated P26,657,500.00 or 5.1 percent of the Agency’s total 
appropriations of P524,198,000.00 for CY 2020 Gender and Development planned 

programs and projects and incurred actual expenditures of P25,952,810.11 or 5 

percent, which is still within the minimum requirement as mandated under Section 

31 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of FY 2020. 

 

66. Section 31 of the General Provisions of RA 11465 or the General Appropriations 
Act for FY 2020 provides that, “All agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender 

and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned 

sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under RA 9710 or the Magna 

Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against 

Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive 

Development (1995-2025) and Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).” 



61 
 

 

67. The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which 
shall be at least five (5) percent of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being 

undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, 

economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and 

fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are 

considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget 

shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies. 

 

68. For CY 2020, the ITDI formulated a GAD Plan and Budget where it allocated 
P26,657,500.00 for the five (5) identified gender mandates equivalent to 5.1 percent of its 

total appropriations of P524,198,000.00.

mainstreaming of GAD projects and activities in its operation with a budget of at least

plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and 

persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the 

same in their regular activities.  Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities 

shall provide architectural or structural features, designs, or facilities that will reasonably 

enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability pursuant to Batas 

Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA 7277, as amended.

74. The vaccination programs noted above were initiated by the ITDI and not in 
coordination with DOH. These programs are done annually for the health and welfare of 

the senior citizen employees of the ITDI. 

 

75. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Continuously allocate funds and implement its programs intended to 
address the concerns and welfare of senior citizens and persons with 

disability, insofar as it relates to the agency’s mandated functions; and 

 



66 
 

b. Submit justification/explanation, reasons why said vaccination program 

was done annually with the ITDI personnel considering that this is not the 

mandate of the agency. 

 

Youth Development 

 

76. There was no program executed by ITDI on youth development because of the community 
quarantine implemented by the government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, 

some offices/divisions were on lockdowns due to multiple positive cases. The perceived health 

risk discouraged Management from conducting training for the youth. 

 

Compliance with other mandatory accounts 

 

77. For CY 2020, the Agency has faithfully deducted from the salaries of its personnel, 
contractors and suppliers the required taxes, premiums and loan installments from its 

personnel, and remitted the same as well as the government share, within the prescribed 

period to the concerned institutions or agencies. Details are shown below:
