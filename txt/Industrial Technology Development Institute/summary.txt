Development Institute for the year ended December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: 

(a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed in Management’s assertions on the 

financial statements; (b) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; (c) determine 

the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules 

and regulations; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit 

recommendations. 

 

D. Independent Auditor’s Report 

 
An Unqualified Opinion was rendered on the financial statements of the ITDI as at 

December 31, 2020 for the immaterial misstatements amounting to P1,816,159.97, 

P1,073,937.27 and P6,377,808.77, which represent only 0.09 percent of the total assets, 

0.12 percent of the total liabilities, and 0.61 percent of the net assets/equity, respectively, 

of the Institute.  

 

E. Summary of Other Significant Observations and Recommendations 

 
The observations and recommendations are discussed in detail in Part II of the 

report, the most significant of which are as follows: 

 

Financial Audit 
 

1. The reported Accounts Payable shown in the Statement of Financial Position and Aging 
Schedule of Accounts Payable as at December 31, 2020, amounting to P90,485,679.52 

did not reconcile with the Budget report on the Due and Demandable obligations of 

P81,654,081.13 in the Aging Schedule of Unpaid Obligation of FAR No. 3 and FAR No.1 

with reported difference of P8,831,598.39 or a variance of P38,451,434.29; thus, casting 

doubt as to correct balances of unpaid obligations as at year-end.        

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant and the 

Budget Officer to reconcile their respective records, submit justification/explanation 

for the cause of variance, if any, and effect the corrections, if necessary. 

 

2. The year-end balance of Due to BIR amounting to P4,634,216.17 is doubtful due to: (i) 
items for adjustment and (ii) items for validation of BIR Audit amounting to P266,444.85 

and P48,546.72, respectively, thus, affecting the fair presentation of the account in the FS. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant to: 

 

a. Trace the nature of the transactions and breakdown of balances or those items 
for adjustment under Due to BIR account to facilitate appropriate action; and 

 

b. Expedite remittance of past due balances to BIR. 
 



iii  

 

 

 

 

Compliance Audit 

 

3. Lack of supporting documents on payment of Traveling Expense violated Section 4 sub-
paragraph 6 of Presidential Decree 1445. 

 

a) Non-attachment of Travel Authority from the Department Secretary or his 
representative for travel exceeding 30 days violated Section 3.c of EO No. 77 

b) Non-Attachment of Official Receipt (OR) for payment of reloading Radiofrequency 
Identification (RFID) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. Require the five (5) ITDI personnel to secure travel authority from the Office of 
the DOST Secretary in compliance with Section 3.c of EO No. 77; and 
 

b. Submit original Official Receipt representing payment of reloading of RFID. 
 

4. Propriety of Fuel, Oil and Lubricants Expense for CY 2020 totaling P269,648.36 could 
not be ascertained due to: (a) non-preparation and submission of required Monthly Report 

of Fuel Consumption and Monthly Report of Official Travel to the Auditor, (b) improperly 

accomplished driver’s trip ticket, (c) failure to use Requisition and Issue Voucher or 

equivalent, and (d) irregularities noted in the reimbursements for fuel paid through petty 

cash fund, contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 77-61 dated September 26, 

1977 and COA Circular No. 96-004 dated April 19, 1996, thus, rendering the accuracy 

and validity of the expended amount doubtful. 

 

    We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

       

a. The Administrative Division to: 
 

i. Enforce complete and proper accomplishment of driver’s trip tickets. To 
facilitate this, require the officer in-charge to orient/teach all drivers in the 

filling out of entries in the trip tickets and in preparing the Monthly 

Report of Official Travel; 

 

ii. Assign personnel to be in-charge of the preparation of the Monthly Report 
of Official Travel and Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption and ensure 

submission thereof to the Office of the Auditor; 

 

iii. Use the RIV instead of the Fuel Request form to properly control and 
account fuel consumption; and 

 

iv. Submit justification with supporting documents for the use of vehicles not 
included in the agency vehicles; and 

 



iv  

b. The Accounting/Finance Management Division to: 
 

i. Instruct Petty Cash Custodians to check complete supporting documents 
for the reimbursement of fuel expenses to ensure that the fuel is loaded 

only into the authorized agency vehicles; and 

 

ii. Prepare necessary adjustment for the incorrect charging to Fuel, Oil and 
Lubricant Expenses. 

 

 The audit observation and recommendation were communicated with the 

Auditee through the issuance of Summary of Observations and Recommendations (SAOR) 

on May 13, 2021 in lieu of exit conference due to the restrictions brought about by the 

COVID 19 pandemic. Management’s views and their comments were incorporated in the
