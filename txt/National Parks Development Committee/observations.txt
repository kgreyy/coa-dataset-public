OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
    

 

A. FINANCIAL AUDIT 
 

There were no material misstatements in the financial statements of the NPDC. 

Accounting errors and improper accounting treatment of transactions that are 

considered departure from the International Public Sector Accounting Standards 

(IPSASs) totaling P13,985,399.61 as summarized in Annex A were adjusted in 

the NPDC books of accounts as at year-end.  

  

 

Deficiencies in Accounting and Property Controls  

 

The agency’s accounting and property controls were evaluated based on 

prescribed accounting standards and other applicable government rules and 

regulations, and the following deficiencies were noted: 

 

1. Weaknesses on property management of NPDC were noted such as,             
(a) inability to establish the fair value measurement of buildings insured by 

NPDC for P715,400.49 with the Government Service Insurance System 

(GSIS) causing the non-recognition of the properties under the Property, 

Plant and Equipment (PPE) account; (b) non-submission of properly 

accomplished Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property 

(IIRUP) as basis for the provision of impairment loss of identified 

unserviceable properties; and (c) failure to provide required information in 

the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) and in the Property 

Cards (PCs) and PPE Ledger Cards (PPELCs) hindered the ease in 

verification/reconciliation of the PPE items. 

 

a) Absence of cost measurement for unrecorded buildings insured for P715,400.49 
with the GSIS  

 

1.1 Chapter 3, Volume III of the Government Accounting Manual for National 
Government Agencies (GAM for NGAs) provides that the Buildings account is 

used to recognize the cost incurred in the purchase or construction or fair value, if 

acquired through donation or transfers without cost of buildings, such as: office 

buildings, research/convention/training centers, agricultural laboratories, 

warehouses, cold storages and the like, for use in government operations. Credit 

this account for disposal, derecognition of the carrying amount of the replaced 

portion in major repair, or reclassification to Investment Property account. 

 

1.2 Section 17 of Republic Act (RA) No. 10607 otherwise known as “The Insurance 
Code” provides that the measure of an insurable interest in property is the extent 

to which the insured might be indemnified by loss or injury thereof. 

 



40 

 

1.3 Section 19 of the same law further states that an interest in property insured must 
exist when the insurance takes effect, and when the loss occurs. 

 

1.4 Our review and evaluation of the accounting and property records disclosed that 
for CY 2020, the NPDC paid insurance premiums totaling P715,400.49 for 

insurable assets including various buildings with an appraised insurable amount 

totaling P34,253,448.12. Inquiry with the Property Officer disclosed that the 

appraisal was done by the Planning Division in 2019 for insurance purposes. The 

breakdown is as follows:

Operation Building 675,000.00 

Electrical building 1,338,750.00 

 Total 34,253,448.12  

 

1.5 Further verification of the accounting records showed that these buildings were 
still not recorded/reflected in the books of the NPDC.  

 

1.6 In the previous year’s audit report, the Accountant averred that he did not record 
the nine buildings in the agency books for having no information or knowledge as 

to who were the real owners of said buildings or whether these were already 

recorded in another government agency’s books, such as the National Museum of 

the Philippines (NMP), being located adjacent to NPDC. 

 

1.7 Records showed that the NPDC sent a letter of inquiry with the NMP on 
September 21, 2020 requesting verification if buildings and structures located in 

Rizal Park which are within the vicinity jurisdiction of NPDC have been recorded 

in the books of accounts of the NMP. In their letter reply dated October 12, 2020, 

NMP provided the list of properties accounted in their books as reported in their 

RPCPPE as of June 30, 2020. As verified by the NPDC, the subject nine buildings 

were not among those listed in the NMP RPCPPE.  

 

1.8 The Accountant however claimed that he did not yet record the nine (9) buildings 
in CY 2020 for lack of sufficient basis such as certificate of title or deed of 

donation to establish their acquisition cost. He also disclosed that NPDC insured 

the buildings because they are currently possessing and occupying the said 

buildings. 

 



41 

 

1.9 Rights is a basic assertion that NPDC has the ownership rights or usage rights to 
all recognized agency assets. The acquisition of PPE, absent any document to 

establish its original cost, can be measured at its fair market value. 

 

1.10 In addition, it is worth emphasizing that under Sections 17 and 19 of the Insurance 
Code, an insurer may insure a property only if there is an existing interest over 

such property at the time of procuring the insurance contract. Hence, without 

existing interest in the property, one cannot claim for insurance benefits or be 

indemnified for any loss.  

 

1.11 This is a reiteration of the observation noted in the CY 2019 AAR. 
 

1.12 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. establish the fair market value of the insured buildings and record the 
same under the Building account in the books of NPDC; and 

 

b. submit to the Audit Team the necessary documents to support the 
recording/adjustment to be made. 

 

b) No approved Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property for provision of 
impairment loss on unserviceable properties 

 

1.13 Section No. 40(d), Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM for NGAs provides that all 
unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of 

Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74). PPE reported in the IIRUP shall 

be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and 

Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation). 

 

1.14 Chapter 3, Volume III of the same GAM describes that the Accumulated 
Impairment Losses - Motor Vehicles is credited for the amount recognized to 

reduce motor vehicles to its recoverable amount due to impairment. This account 

is debited upon disposal, derecognition of the asset, or reversal of impairment. 

 

1.15 For CY 2020, the NPDC reported in the IIRUP various unserviceable/obsolete 
properties, amounting to P7,804,095.95: 

 

PPE No. of Items 
Gross Amount 

(In PhP) 
Remarks 

Motor Vehicles 6 3,109,000.00 Unserviceable 

Office Equipment 33   2,665,123.95  Unserviceable 

ICT Equipment 6 232,350.00 Unserviceable 

Machinery 31 1,797,622.00 Unserviceable 

Total 76 7,804,095.95  

 

 



42 

 

 

1.16 A copy of the IIRUP was submitted to the Audit Team on March 9, 2021. 
However, review and verification of the report disclosed the following 

deficiencies: 

 

a. The IIRUP was still unsigned by the responsible officials. 
b. No copy of the duly signed IIRUP was submitted to the Accounting Section. 
c. The IIRUP was not properly accomplished as necessary information such as 

accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses and carrying 

amount were not provided; hence, the accurate amount of the unserviceable 

PPEs cannot be validated and verified. 

d. There were PPEs in the IIRUP that were not reflected in the RPCPPE and 
vice-versa such that there were PPEs in the RPCPPE tagged/labeled as for 

disposal but were not reflected in the submitted IIRUP. 

 

1.17 The PPEs that are supposed to be due for disposal and reflected in the IIRUP are 
PPEs with no future economic benefits and their service potential are no longer 

expected to flow to the agency. Hence, the non-provision of impairment losses on 

the unserviceable PPEs affects the proper valuation of the PPE account balances.  

 

1.18 We recommended that Management require the Property Unit to: 
 

a. submit to the Accounting Section a duly signed IIRUP containing all the 
necessary data/information as reflected in Appendix 74, Volume II of the 

GAM for NGAs; and 

 

b. require the Accountant to provide/ record Impairment Loss for the 
identified unserviceable PPEs. 

 
c) Lacking information in the RPCPPE, PCs and PPELCs and deficiencies on non-

renewal of Property Acknowledgement Receipt and bonding of Property Officer 

 

1.19 Section 38, Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM for NGAs requires that the agency 
shall have a periodic physical count of PPE which shall be done annually and 

presented in the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment 

(Appendix 73) as at December 31 of each year. Appendix 73 prescribes the form 

with columns to be accomplished with necessary information. 

 

1.20 Section 42 of the same chapter of GAM for NGAs requires that the Chief 
Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE. The PPELC shall 

be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful 

life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. 

For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise 

maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of 

the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with the PPELC maintained by 



43 

 

the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property 

records like the Property Acknowledgment Receipt (PAR). 

 

1.21 Further, Section 21 thereof requires the Supply and/or Property Custodian to 
prepare the PAR (Appendix 71) to support the issue of property to end-user. The 

PAR shall be renewed at least every three years or every time there is a change in 

accountability or custodianship of the property. 

 

1.22 The following deficiencies were observed in the PPE inventory report and 
property/accounting records of the NPDC: 

 

a. The RPCPPE lacks the necessary data/ information such that columns for 
“property number”, “remarks”, “quantity per property card” and “quantity per 

physical count” columns were not filled up. The Property Number is the key 

identity of the PPE item. The Remarks on the RPCPPE is important in order 

to ascertain the whereabouts, conditions and other relevant information 

relative to PPE. The Quantity per Property Card and Quantity per Physical 

Count somehow will attest to the existence of the property items, subject to 

actual inspection/validation. 

 

b. The PCs and the PPELCs were not updated and the relevant information for 
each column were not completely filled up which resulted in difficulty in the 

verification and reconciliation of PPEs. 

 

c. There were PARs for properties issued in CY 2017 and prior years that were 
not renewed; while PARs issued in CYs 2018, 2019 and 2020 were not 

complete as there were PPEs in the RPCPPE with no corresponding PAR. 

Renewal of PARs and updating of the same is important in order not to put 

the NPDC at risk of not being fully indemnified in cases of defalcations, 

shortages, unrelieved losses in the accounts of public officers/employees 

concerned. 

 

1.23 Furthermore, the Head of the Property Unit of NPDC is not duly bonded contrary 
to the requirements under Section 101.2 of PD No. 1445 that every accountable 

officer shall be properly bonded in accordance with law, thereby exposing the 

government to risk of not being fully indemnified in case of defalcation, shortage 

or loss. 

 

1.24 We recommended and Management agreed to require the – 
 

a. PPE Inventory Committee to complete all the necessary data/ information 
in the RPCPPE as required in Appendix 73, Volume II of the GAM for 

NGAs for proper identification and valuation; 

 



44 

 

b. Accountant and the Property Officer to update and complete their 
records with all the relevant information in the PPELC and PC to 

facilitate verification and reconciliation of their respective records;  

  

c. Property Unit to renew the issuance of PPE to the end-user every three 
(3) years or as necessary using the PAR; and 

 

d. Head, Property Unit to apply for bond in accordance with Section 101 of 
PD No. 1445. 

 

 

B. COMPLIANCE AUDIT 
 

Utilization of the authorized budget and cash allocations 

 

2. For CY 2020, NPDC received total allotments of P250,067,647.94 consisting 
of current year’s release of P237,600,927.00 and extended allotments of 

P12,466,720.94. Of the total allotments received, P245,421,712.55 or 98.14 

percent was obligated, leaving a total unobligated balance of P4,645,935.39, 

of which, P133,294.03 had lapsed as of December 31, 2020 and P4,512,641.36 

was extended until CY 2021 thus, utilization of the agency’s authorized 

budget was not fully maximized.  Further, the rate of disbursement over the 

obligations incurred of 82.35 percent, which is equivalent to P202,101,567.95 

indicates a low spending capacity for the current year’s budget. Accordingly, 

of the total cash allocations of P263,778,899.00, only P22,558,351.25 or 8.55 

percent was not utilized which was reverted to the Bureau of the Treasury 

(BTr). 

 

a. Unutilized Allotment - P4,645,935.39 
 

2.1 Section 60 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, or the General 
Appropriations Act (GAA) of FY 2020, and Section 3.4 of the National Budget 

Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated January 6, 2020 under the Cash Budgeting System 

provide that all appropriations authorized under the FY 2020 GAA, including 

budgetary support to Government-Owned or -Controlled Corporation (GOCCs) 

and Special Account in the General Fund (SAGF), shall be available for release 

and disbursement for the purpose specified, and under the same General and 

Special Provisions of said GAA applicable thereto until December 31, 2020.  

 

2.2 However, RA No. 11520 as approved by the President on December 29, 2020 
extended the availability of the FY 2020 appropriations to December 31, 2021, 

amending the purpose of Section 60 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 

or the General Appropriations Act of FY 2020. 

 

2.3 Further, Section 4.1 of NBC No. 580 dated April 22, 2020 provides that to 
implement the national policy to address the Corona Virus Disease 2019 



45 

 

(COVID-19) situation and to partially generate the required amounts for the 

pandemic, while observing the overall expenditure program for FY 2020, 

government instrumentalities concerned are advised that thirty-five percent (35%) 

of programmed appropriations under the FY 2020 GAA shall no longer be made 

available for release effective April 1, 2020.  Likewise, at least ten percent (10%) 

of the total released allotments to covered entities under Section 2 thereof for 

Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOEs) and Capital Outlays 

(COs), shall no longer be available for obligation.  

 

2.4 In addition, the same circular provides that no allotment shall be released for new 
programs, projects, activities including Congress-Introduced Increases which are 

not likely to be implemented within the current calendar year, FY 2020. 

 

2.5 Review of the NPDC’s appropriations, allotments and obligations as of December 
31, 2020 showed that out of the total allotment received that was available for 

spending for CY 2020 in the aggregate amount of P250,067,647.94, 

P245,421,712.55 or 98.14 percent was obligated, leaving an 

unobligated/unutilized balance of P4,645,935.39, of which, P133,294.03 had 

lapsed as of December 31, 2020 and P4,512,641.36 was extended until CY 2021. 

The rate of disbursement over obligations incurred of 82.35 percent which is 

equivalent to P202,101,567.95 indicates a low spending capacity for the year’s 

budget. The summary of the budgetary allocations and balances including the 

percentage of utilization is presented in the table below:

Percentage of Disbursement over Obligations Incurred

2.6 As shown in the above table, the NPDC has a high obligation rate of 98.14 
percent. However, the disbursement rate for the year was only 82.35 percent 

which indicates low physical delivery of target projects and activities. The 

undisbursed obligations in CY 2020 aggregating P43,320,144.60 is broken down 

as follows:  

 

a. Unpaid overtime payment of regular employees from June to December 2020; 
unpaid tax withheld from salaries and allowances of NPDC employees; and 

monetization of terminal leave benefits of retired employees, in the total 

amount of P2,591,319.55. 

 

b. Delayed billing/claims for service providers for security and janitorial 
services, various repairs and maintenance of parks, buildings and structures, 

information and communication, office machinery and equipment and motor 

vehicles; delayed billing of consultants, professional services for operations of 

musical dancing fountains, professional services for annual physical/medical 

examination and laboratory services of NPDC employees which were done in 

December 2020; and delayed procurement of supplies and materials, in the 

total amount of P21,408,852.29. 

 

c. Delayed billing of the contractor for progress billing and retention fees for the 
projects: (a) Landscaping and Park Development of Light and Sound 

Complex; (b) Rehabilitation of Sprinkler Water System; (c) Dredging and 

Water proofing of lagoon and Security Platform in Roxas Boulevard; and 

delayed procurement of directory and window server and water pump, in the 

total amount of P19,319,972.76. 

 

2.7 The above delays and non-payment of personal services were due to the pandemic 
in CY 2020 which resulted in almost 20 percent non-utilization of fund releases; 

hence, NPDC was not able to fully maximize the utilization of’ the allocated 

budget for the year which somehow affected the ability to serve the immediate 

needs of its personnel and other parties and provide the public the full services it 

intended to deliver during the year. 

 

2.8 The Management commented that they are committed to fully utilize the budget 
that was approved for the agency by timely implementation of projects/programs/ 

activities.  The balance of P4,645,935.39 or 1.86 percent of the approved budget 

was not obligated because of the Community Quarantine imposed by the 



47 

 

government last year which limited the mobility of the agency to implement the 

various projects/ programs/ activities in CY 2020. Further for CY 2021, total 

obligation from the continuing appropriation is P3,259,708.44 or 73.50 percent 

from which the balance of P1,175,503.49 or 26.50 percent will be fully obligated 

until December 31, 2021. 

 

2.9 We recommended that Management maximize the use of allotments received 
for the year through timely implementation of projects/programs/activities 

and to fully utilize its fund releases to efficiently and effectively provide the 

needs of its personnel, stakeholders and other clienteles.   

 

b. Unutilized/Reverted Cash Allocations - P22,558,351.25 
 

2.10 DBM Circular Letter No. 2016-9 dated October 27, 2016 requires agencies to 
prepare a realistic monthly disbursement program (MDP) for the implementation 

of their programs and projects, taking into consideration the seasonality of 

activities, scheduled work targets of capital outlays, and timing of the grant of 

benefits, allowances and other similar items of expenditures. 

 

2.11 Moreover, NBC No. 577 dated May 2, 2019 issued the Guidelines on the Release 
of Funds for FY 2019.  Under Section 4.6.2.2, Crediting and Validity Periods for 

Notice of Cash Allocations (NCAs) for Budgetary Accounts of the said Circular, 

provides that to optimize the use of the available NCAs under the Regular 

Modified Disbursement System (MDS) Sub-Account, NCAs released to agencies 

under said account can be used to cover payment of both Current Year and Prior 

Years’ Accounts Payables to all creditors (external and internal).  It is understood 

that payment of mandatories, i.e., PS, MOOE and CO requirements shall take 

precedence over Accounts Payables in the utilization of the NCAs received. Only 

when the mandatory requirements are satisfied can the payment of Accounts 

Payables be charged against the available NCAs. 

 

2.12 Review of the actual utilization of the available budget disclosed that NCAs 
aggregating P263,778,899.00 were received and allocated for CY 2020 for the 

implementation of projects/programs/activities, payment of salaries and wages, 

personnel benefits and operating expenses of the NPDC. The total amount of 

P241,220,547.75 was disbursed or 91.45 percent was utilized to pay current and 

prior year’s obligations, while P22,558,351.25 or 8.55 percent had lapsed and 

reverted to the BTr. Details are as follow:

2.13 Of the total received cash allocations of P263,778,899.00 for CY 2020, the 
amount of P46,406,812.06 was used for the payment of prior years’ obligations 

which was authorized under National Budget Circular No. 578 dated January 6, 

2020. 

 

2.14 The significant amount of P20,918,389.49, out of the P22,558,351.25 reverted 
cash allocations to the BTr, was automatically lapsed in the second quarter of CY 

2020 due to lockdowns in NCR because of the COVID-19 pandemic which 

hampered procurement of supplies and materials and the implementation of 

projects.  

 

2.15 Verification showed that the NPDC was however granted an additional release of 
NCA as per NCA-BMB-A-19-0026455 on December 17, 2020 to pay various 

obligations that accumulated in the last quarter of the year. 

 

2.16 Although the COVID-19 pandemic has caused the delay of implementation of 
various programs, projects and activities particularly in the second quarter of the 

year and the unexpected GSIS moratorium on loan payments, the NPDC was able 

to utilize P241,220,547.75 or 91.45 percent of the received cash allocation of 

P263,778,899.00 during the year. This indicates that Management was able to 

effectively manage the amount of funds entrusted to the agency. 



49 

 

2.17 We commended Management for the efficient cash management as 91.45 
percent of the available cash allocations was immediately utilized to settle 

due and demandable obligations. 
 

 

Targets vs Accomplishments 

 

3. Only three (3) of NPDC’s nine (9) targeted activities under the two (2) 
Organizational Outcomes had been 100 percent accomplished while 

accomplishments in six (6) activities have significantly decreased due to the 

closure of the parks and the cancellation of regular shows of the park    

brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.    

 

3.1 DBM issued National Budget Circular No. 552 dated February 19, 2014 that 
defines Organizational Outcome (OOs) as an outcome or result produced by the 

Agency that contributes to the achievement of the legislated mandate of that 

department or agency and is achieved through the production of goods or services 

to external clients (MFOs), delivered through its projects, activities and programs. 

 

3.2 The Circular further discussed the Performance Indicator that the Agency must 
include in their targets with their timeframe and the methods for collecting and 

measuring the performance data that is to be monitored. Performance Target is 

also defined as a quantitative goal with a time line (usually explicit, but 

sometimes implicit) for the achievement of that goal. The DBM requires the 

government agencies to submit reports to monitor their accomplishments/outputs 

vis-à-vis the allotment/budget released to them.  

 

3.3 Pursuant to Proclamation No. 929 (s. 2020), the President of the Philippines 
declared a State of Calamity in the entire country for a period of six (6) months, 

imposed an Enhanced Community Quarantine over the entire Luzon effective 

March 17, 2020 until April 13, 2020. Thereafter, several proclamations were 

made by the President declaring the Metro Manila Area under the General 

Community Quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

3.4 Due to the pandemic, the accomplishments of the NPDC as reported in the 
Physical and Financial Accomplishments for CY 2020 vis-à-vis the target of the

3.5 The said accomplishments disclosed that Management was able to accomplish 
100 percent to only three (3) of the nine (9) targeted activities under the two (2) 

OOs while accomplishment in six (6) activities have significantly  decreased due 

to closure of the parks from March 12, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and cancellation of 

regular shows of the park from March 12, 2020 to December 31, 2020 brought 

about by the COVID-19 emergency situation wherein the NCR was placed under 

the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) and GCQ classifications.  

 

3.6 Nevertheless, the NPDC had conducted 48 online events and 25 hybrid of online 
and physical activities with average satisfactory rating of 98.75 percent from 200 

respondents and 255,245 online viewers. The result of the survey was for the   

continued effort and support to bring entertainment to the park goers and the 

general public. 

 

3.7 We recommended that Management continuously monitor the 
accomplishment of planned activities taking into consideration the provision 

of appropriate strategies to attain delivery of targeted outputs for the benefit 

of its clienteles despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 

 

Dormant/Unauthorized Cash Balances –  P6,438,915.68 

 

4. The Cash in Bank-LCCA account balance of P8,727,690.26 as of December 
31, 2020 includes cash balances considered as dormant, unauthorized 

accounts, unnecessary trust funds and related accounts without valid 

claimants amounting to at least P6,438,915.68 which remained unremitted to 

the Bureau of the Treasury contrary to DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 

4-2012. Moreover, the NPDC has no MDS Trust Account maintained for 

project funds from other government agencies; and it is still not adopting the 

Land Bank of the Philippines Financial Data Entry System (FinDES) 

pursuant to Executive Order No. 55 Series of 2011. 

 

4.1 DOF, DBM, COA (Permanent Committee) Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated 
September 11, 2012 provides the rules and regulations implementing Executive 

Order (EO) No. 431 dated May 30, 2005 directing the reversion of all dormant 

accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds to the General Fund and for other 

purposes. 

 

4.2 Relatively, COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015 prescribes the 
guidelines and procedures in the reversion to the General Fund of all dormant 

cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds and related 

accounts without valid claimants in conformity with the Permanent Committee 

Joint Circular No. 4-2012. 

 

4.3 The procedural guidelines require the preparation of the disbursement voucher 
and check for the withdrawal of the dormant/unauthorized cash balances, and their 

deposit to the National Treasury.  



52 

 

4.4 Verification of the Cash in Bank–LCCA account showed that the NPDC 
maintains two (2) depository bank accounts with the Land Bank of the Philippines 

(LBP), as follows:

Sub-Total 1,658,708.25 

Total 8,097,623.93 

 

4.6 Further verification and analysis of the account Cash in Bank–LCCA disclosed 
that: 

 

a. The cash from undocumented Other Payables and Customers’ Deposits 
Payable in the total amount of P4,574,352.76 remained deposited with the 

LBP – LCCA account.  Inquiry with the Accountant revealed that these 

deposits were already existing in the bank account a long time ago and their 

nature, and details can no longer be identified and accounted due to lack of 

supporting documents as well as absence of transaction reference provided in 

the ledger. Also, in compliance to EO No. 87 s. 20191, the corresponding 

Other Payables and Customers’ Deposits Payable accounts were already 

                                                 
1 Section 2 of Executive Order No. 87 dated August 13, 2019 directs that all accounts payable which are undocumented or not covered 

by perfected contracts on record, regardless of the year in which they were incurred, shall automatically be reverted to the 
Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund. 



53 

 

closed to the account Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund in 

CY 2019 but the equivalent cash balances were retained in the LBP current 

account. 

 

b. The amount of P1,864,562.92 represents cash balance reported as book 
reconciling item which was established as the difference between the book 

and bank balances in prior years. This has been the subject of audit 

observations in previous years’ Annual Audit Reports (AARs) in CYs 2016, 

2017 and 2018 since there were no documents or authority to support in 

maintaining the cash balance to be accounted under the Cash in Bank–LCCA.  

 

c. Collections/Receipts from cash bonds and sales of bid documents in the total 
amount of P1,158,708.25 were deposited to the LBP – LCCA account. 

According to the Accountant, the NPDC will remit the excess of collections to 

the BTr after payment of honoraria and overtime claims of BAC Secretariat 

and BAC Technical Working Group (TWG). 

 

4.7 In the absence of documents or legal authority to prove their valid purpose and 
necessity to be retained as active trust accounts, the cash balances pertaining to 

undocumented prior year’s Other Payables and Customers’ Deposits Payable, 

undocumented book reconciling item and collections from cash bonds and sales of 

bid documents after payment of valid claims should be remitted to the National 

Treasury to accrue to the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund of the 

Government in compliance with DOF, DBM, COA Joint Circular 4-2012. 

 

4.8 Moreover, the following deficiencies on maintaining the required bank accounts 
for NPDC were noted: 

 

a. It has no MDS Trust Account wherein to download funds received from other 
government agencies and for the disbursements of NPDC funds to settle 

payments incurred for the projects; hence, financial assistance from other 

government agency in the amount of P500,000.00 is deposited to the LBP – 

LCCA of the agency. 

 

b. It still maintains a payroll account with the LBP instead of using the LBP 
Financial Data Entry System (FinDES) pursuant to Executive Order No. 55 

series of 2011 that allows the direct crediting of payroll funds from the 

agency’s MDS account through List of Due and Demandable Accounts 

Payable with Advice to Debit Account (LDDAP-ADA) to the automated teller 

machine (ATM) accounts of their employees. As an alternative, the agency 

may open a pass-through account for the uploading of payroll via the LBP’s 

We Access facility. The said pass-through account is non-interest bearing and 

will have zero-balance and is exempt from initial deposit and maintaining 

balance requirement. The account will facilitate online-crediting and NGA 

initiated uploading of payroll and will serve as source account in the We 

Access facility. 



54 

 

4.9 We recommended that Management:  
 

a. immediately remit to the BTr the cash balances arising from 
undocumented Customers’ Deposits Payable, Other Payables, the cash 

equivalent of the unreconciled amount between the book and bank 

balances in prior years and collections from cash bonds and sales of bid 

documents after payment of valid claims in compliance with COA, DBM 

and DOF Joint Circular No. 4-2012 and following the procedures 

prescribed under COA Circular No. 2015-001;  

 

b. file a request with the BTr to open an MDS Trust Account for the receipt 
and disbursement of funds pertaining to other government agencies; and 

 

c. close the payroll account with the LBP and use the LBP Financial Data 
Entry System pursuant to EO No. 55 series of 2011 or open a pass-

through account with LBP for the uploading of payroll via the LBP We 

Access facility. 
 

 

Non-enforcement of the full settlement of Long Outstanding Receivables – 

P24,269,572.29 

 

5. Long outstanding/inactive receivables in the aggregate amount of 
P24,269,572.29 or 83.61 percent of the total Operating Lease Receivables 

balance of P29,026,927.00 were doubtful of collection due to: (a) slow 

movement of on-going court litigations and inability of NPDC to enforce the 

full settlement of long outstanding receivables amounting to P7,733,058.58; 

and (b) failure to file appropriate collection charges for the erring 

concessionaires with unsettled balance of P16,536,513.71. 

 

5.1 As of December 31, 2020, the Operating Lease Receivable account of the NPDC 
amounted to P29,026,927.20, aged under the following categories of tenants:

5.2 The long outstanding operating lease receivables pertain to 22 inactive accounts 
of former tenants/ lessees/ concessionaires, with aggregate amount of 

P24,269,572.29, which remained unsettled for over five (5) years. 

 



55 

 

5.3 Five (5) accounts in the aggregate amount of P7,733,058.58 were filed with civil 
cases of which four (4) accounts already have court decisions while one (1) is 

submitted back to court for decision. 

 

5.4 Management, however, was not able to enforce the four (4) court decisions in 
favor of NPDC due to its failure to send demand letters and/or inability to locate 

the concessionaires’ whereabouts; hence, the receivables remained uncollected as 

of year-end. Hereunder is the status of the cases as at December 31, 2020:

No further action was reported

Total 7,733,058.58    

 

5.5 As can be gleaned from the above table, four (4) cases were already decided in 
favor of the NPDC; however, the same were not yet enforced. The Audit Team 

has requested for the updates/actions taken for these receivables with court cases 

but Management could not provide anything. Further inquiry from Management 

disclosed that for CY 2020, no action was taken by the Management to enforce 

these receivables because Management could not locate the whereabouts of the 

above concessionaires. 



57 

 

5.6 Furthermore, NPDC’s 17 accounts with aggregate amount of P16,536,513.71 
remained unenforced/unsettled due to Management’s failure to send demand 

letters and/or inability to locate the concessionaires’ whereabouts. These 

businesses were already closed or no longer operating within the Rizal Park area.

Foundation (LUSWELF) 

June 2018 1,304,380.00 

Total 16,536,513.71 

 

5.7 It was noted that the above 17 inactive cases of former lessees/concessionaires, 
with receivables in the aggregate amount of P16,536,513.71 comprise 56.97 

percent of the total Operating Lease Receivables which remained unsettled. The 

non-collection of these long outstanding receivables deprived the government of 

additional income to finance its major projects. 

 

5.8 Moreover, Management had no reported actions or efforts in locating the 
whereabouts of these inactive concessionaires and/or their current addresses thru 

other government agencies.  

 

5.9 The Management may consider and/or initiate request for authority to write-off 
dormant Accounts Receivables but proper compliance/documentation shall first 

be complied with in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated 

December 19, 2016, which prescribes the guidelines and procedures on the write-

off of dormant receivable accounts. 

 

 

 



58 

 

5.10 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. take appropriate measures to enforce the collection of the receivables 
pertaining to accounts with decided cases and submit to the Office of the 

Auditor the updated status of the five (5) accounts with Court cases; 
 

b. enforce collection of the long outstanding receivables by sending demand 
letters and/or request assistance from other government agencies to 

locate the whereabouts of the inactive lessees/concessionaires with closed 

businesses; and/or 
 

c. request for the authority to write-off dormant Accounts Receivables in 
accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 

subject to compliance with the prescribed guidelines and procedures on 

the write-off of dormant Receivable accounts. 

 

5.11 Management commentated that through their Legal Office, they have been in 
coordination with the Office of the Solicitor General to determine the appropriate 

legal actions to be taken regarding the four cases with judgement.  A demand 

letter for the full settlement of P66,127.43 will be sent to /Colunik Enterprise for 

compliance to the compromise agreement entered into with NPDC. A letter for 

the other government agencies i.e. National Bureau of Investigation, Philippine 

Statistics Authority, Commission on Election, Manila City Hall, Social Security 

System will be sent to request assistance for the last known addresses of the 

named inactive lessees/ concessionaires.  If and when the whereabouts/addresses 

of inactive lessees are not known, a request for the authority to write-off their 

accounts will be requested in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated 

December 19, 2016 which prescribes the guidelines and procedures on the write-

off of dormant receivable accounts. 

 

 

Disbursements not supported with official receipts and/or unsigned to acknowledge 

payment – P23,996,871.60 

 

6. Paid disbursement vouchers (DVs) amounting to P23,996,871.60 were not 
supported with Official Receipts (ORs) acknowledging the receipt of 

payment and/or the “received by” portion of the payroll/disbursement 

voucher were not signed by the payees signifying acknowledgement of the 

payment contrary to Section 3 of COA Circular No. 2004-006 and applicable 

provisions of DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14. Further, Management failed 

to post in its website the notice or status of the creditor/ payees’ claims. 

 

6.1 Section 3 of COA Circular No. 2004-006 provides the guidelines and principles 
on the acceptability of the evidence of receipt of payment for disbursement. 

 



59 

 

6.2 DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14 dated December 28, 2018 prescribing the 
updated guidelines in the implementation of the Modified Direct Payment Scheme 

(MDPS) due creditors/payees of all NGAs provide, among others, the following: 

 

a. Consistent with accounting and auditing rules and regulations, the NGAs are 
reminded to require their creditors to issue OR or Sales Invoice as evidence of 

receipt of payment through LLDAP-ADA and Summary of LDDAP-ADAs 

Issued and Invalidated ADA Entries (SLIIE) or MDS check.   However, in 

instances where supply of goods is ON CREDIT and the required Sales 

Invoice are issued upon delivery of goods, supplemental/secondary receipts 

such as Acknowledgement Receipt or Collection Receipt are issued upon 

collection of account following Revenue Regulations No. 18-2012. 

 

b. In the case of supplier/contractor who failed to submit Official Receipt or 
sales invoice, the list of bank-validated ADA shall be attached to the DV as 

proof of payment. Non-issuance of Official Receipt or Sales Invoice by the 

contractor/supplier shall be reported to the BIR as violation of regulations.  

 

c. The agency shall furnish the creditor/payees the LDDAP-ADA number for 
purposes of inquiries on the status of their claim and shall be responsible to 

post on its website the LDDAP-ADA numbers endorsed for direct payment to 

the MDS-GSB. This will serve as notice to the creditors/payees concerned on 

the status of their claims. 

 

6.3 Audit of transactions covering the period January 2020 to December 2020 
revealed that pertinent documents for the payments made to consultants, 

contractors/suppliers, performing artists and resigned/ retired NPDC employees 

amounting to P23,996,871.50 were not signed by the payees signifying 

acknowledgement of receipt of payment or were not supported by any acceptable 

evidence of receipt of payment contrary to the above provisions, thus cast doubts 

in the validity, correctness and accuracy of the claim. These payments are 

summarized below: 

 

Payees 
Amount 

(In PhP) 
Remarks 

Consultants/ Specialists 357,000.00 DVs not signed by Payees 

Performing Artists 899,541.44 DVs not signed by Payees and No 

ORs 

Contractor’s/ Suppliers 22,194,380.27 DVs not signed by Payees and No 

ORs 

NPDC Resigned/ Retired 

Employees 

545,949.78 DVs not signed by Payees  

Total 23,996,871.50  

 

6.4 Our evaluation of the processing of payment of Accounts Payable under the 
Expanded Modified Direct Payment Scheme (ExMDPS) in NPDC disclosed that 

the Accountant, after verification on the completeness of supporting documents, 



60 

 

prepares the LDDAP-ADA. This report is signed by the Chief, Administrative 

Officer of the Administrative Division assuming full responsibility for the 

veracity and accuracy of the listed claims and the authenticity of the supporting 

documents submitted by claimants while the Accountant warrants that the 

LDDAP was prepared in accordance with existing budgeting, accounting and 

auditing rules and regulations. 

 

6.5 Upon receipt of the Government Servicing Bank of the LDDAP-ADA, the bank 
immediately credits the amount to the respective accounts of the 

contractors/suppliers/ artists. With this process, payment is no longer handed over 

personally to the payees. As a result, the agency experienced difficulty is securing 

Official Receipts.   

 

6.6 The Audit Team observed that the contractors/suppliers and performing artists 
could not easily ascertain the payment made by the agency because the LDDAP-

ADA number was not posted in the agency’s website or furnished to 

creditors/payees for purposes of inquiry on the status of their claims resulting in 

the delay or non-issuance of Official Receipts.   

 

6.7 In addition, inquiry with the Disbursing Officer (DO) revealed that the OR is no 
longer required and insisted that the list of bank-validated ADA is sufficient proof 

of payment to be attached to the DV as what she read in DBM Circular Letter No. 

2018-14; hence there were no effort from Management to demand from the 

contractors or suppliers the issuance of ORs. 

 

6.8 Further, Consultants/ Specialists, retired or resigned employees and artists which 
do not have accreditations were not required to sign the received portion of the 

DVs or issue other forms of acknowledgment receipt as evidence of receipt of 

payments for disbursement.   

 

6.9 The DO could have misunderstood the provision of the said DBM Circular 
because it clearly stated that consistent with accounting and auditing rules and 

regulations, the Management is reminded to require their creditors to issue OR or 

Sales Invoice as evidence of receipt of payment through LLDAP-ADA and SLIIE 

or MDS check.  It is only in the event when the supplier/contractor failed to 

submit OR or sales invoice despite several demands by Management that the list 

of bank-validated ADA shall be attached to the DV as proof of payment. 

Moreover, the Management has the responsibility to report to the BIR these erring 

contractors/suppliers for violation of regulations. 

 

6.10 Moreover, for those payees who could not issue ORs such as consultants, 
employees, artists who were not accredited, the NPDC should demand the written 

signature on the received portion of the DV or they may require the payees to 

issue any form of evidence of receipt of payment. 

 



61 

 

6.11 Due to Management’s failure to secure evidence of receipt of payment for 
disbursement from the consultants/ specialists, contractors, suppliers, artists and 

NPDC retired or resigned employees, disbursement of funds could not be properly 

accounted. This practice runs counter to the provisions of DBM Circular Letter 

2013-16.   

 

6.12 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. furnish the creditors/payees with the LDDAP-ADA numbers for their 
information and require the contractors, suppliers and accredited artists 

to acknowledge payment made by the agency with the issuance of Official 

Receipts so that disbursements will be properly accounted; and require 

them to comply with BIR regulations;  

 

b. require those payees who are not required to issue ORs to sign on the 
“Received by” portion of the DVs or issue other form of evidence of 

receipt of payment mentioned in COA Circular No. 2004-006; and 

 

c. post in the NPDC website the notice or status of the creditor/payee’s 
claim. 

 

 

Compliance to RA No. 9184 and its Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations 

 

7. The NPDC did not faithfully adhere to the provisions of RA No. 9184 and its 
Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) on the: (a) period of 

action on procurement activities of four (4) infrastructure projects that were 

awarded beyond the allowable time; and (b) completion date of two (2) 

infrastructure projects with work extension and one (1) project with changes 

in the scope of work and Bill of Quantities which were not adequately 

supported with documents, hence, casting doubts on the integrity of the 

procurement process and reasonableness of the awarded contracts 

amounting to P46,518,266.95. In addition, the Bid Evaluation Sheets and the 

Post-Qualification Reports, though signed by the Technical Working Group 

members, were undated. Hence, the timing and length of time when the said 

activities were performed is not determined. 

 

a. Exceeded the procurement activities timelines   

 

7.1 Annex C of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA No. 9184 
provides the period of action of the procurement activities. 

 

7.2 The NPDC has bidded out four (4) projects with contract costs ranging from 
P5,394,500.00 to P25,177,128.51 that were awarded beyond the allowable time. 

These projects are as follows:

* Period of action in terms of calendar days of the procurement activities 

 

7.3 The project Landscape and Park Redevelopment of Light and Sound Complex 
had the longest period of 56 days, counted from November 16, 2019 to January 

31, 2020.  The Team noted that the delay in the procurement activity happened 

during the Post-Qualification stage, Approval of Resolution and Issuance of 

Notice of Award stage, with the longest delay of 56 calendar days. 

 

7.4 We also noted that there was no date indicated when the TWG members signed 
the Bid Evaluation Sheets and the Post-Qualifications Reports.  Hence, the timing 

and the length of time when the said activities were performed is not determined. 

 

7.5 Infrastructure projects should be implemented and completed within the 
scheduled time frame so that the intended social and economic benefits may be 

enjoyed by the intended beneficiaries on time. 

 

b. Absence of Documents on Work Suspensions/Extensions and Variations/ 
Change Order 

 

7.6 Annex E of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 provides contract implementation 
guidelines for the procurement of infrastructure projects. Items 9 and 10 of the 

Annex states that:  

 

9.  SUSPENSION OF WORK 

 

9.1. The procuring entity shall have the authority to suspend the work wholly 

or partly by written order for such period as may be deemed necessary, 

due to force majeure or any fortuitous events or for failure on the part of 

the contractor to correct bad conditions which are unsafe for workers or 

for the general public, to carry out valid orders given by the procuring 



63 

 

entity or to perform any provisions of the contract, or due to adjustment 

of plans to suit field conditions as found necessary during construction. 

The contractor shall immediately comply with such order to suspend the 

work wholly or partly. 

 

9.2. The contractor or its duly authorized representative shall have the right 

to suspend work operation on any or all projects/activities along the 

critical path of activities after fifteen (15) calendar days from date of 

receipt of written notice from the contractor to the district 

engineer/regional director/consultant or equivalent official, as the case 

may be, due to the following: 

 

i. There exist right-of-way problems which prohibit the contractor from 
performing work in accordance with the approved construction 

schedule. 

 

ii. Requisite construction plans which must be owner-furnished are not 
issued to the contractor precluding any work called for by such plans. 

 

iii. Peace and order conditions make it extremely dangerous, if not 
possible, to work. However, this condition must be certified in writing 

by the Philippine National Police (PNP) station which has 

responsibility over the affected area and confirmed by the Department 

of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Regional Director. 

 

iv. There is failure on the part of the procuring entity to deliver 
government furnished materials and equipment as stipulated in the 

contract. 

 

v. Delay in the payment of contractor's claim for progress billing beyond 
forty-five (45) calendar days from the time the contractor's claim has 

been certified to by the procuring entity’s authorized representative 

that the documents are complete unless there are justifiable reasons 

thereof which shall be communicated in writing to the contractor. 

 

10.    EXTENSION OF CONTRACT TIME  

 

10.2. No extension of contract time shall be granted the contractor due to (a) 

ordinary unfavorable weather conditions and (b) inexcusable failure or 

negligence of contractor to provide the required equipment, supplies or 

materials. 

 

10.3. Extension of contract time may be granted only when the affected 

activities fall within the critical path of the PERT/CPM network. 

          

         Xxx 



64 

 

10.5. Extension of contract time shall be granted for rainy/unworkable days 

considered unfavorable for the prosecution of the works at the site, 

based on the actual conditions obtained at the site, in excess of the 

number of rainy/unworkable days pre-determined by the government in 

relation to the original contract time during the conduct of detailed 

engineering and in the preparation of the contract documents as agreed 

upon by the parties before contract perfection, and/or for equivalent 

period of delay due to major calamities such as exceptionally 

destructive typhoons, floods and earthquakes, and epidemics, and for 

causes such as non-delivery on time of materials, working drawings, or 

written information to be furnished by the procuring entity, non-

acquisition of permit to enter private properties within the right-of-way 

resulting in complete paralysis of construction activities, and other 

meritorious causes as determined by the Government's authorized 

Engineer and approved by the procuring entity. Shortage of 

construction materials, general labor strikes, and peace and order 

problems that disrupt construction operations through no fault of the 

contractor may be considered as additional grounds for extension of 

contract time provided they are publicly felt and certified by 

appropriate government agencies such as DTI, DOLE, DILG, and 

DND, among others. The written consent of bondsmen must be attached 

to any request of the contractor for extension of contract time and 

submitted to the procuring entity for consideration and the validity of 

the performance security shall be correspondingly extended. 

 

7.7 Verification of documents supporting the payments of two (2) infrastructure 
projects disclosed that completion dates were revised/extended without the proper 

documents showing the contractor’s request for suspension of work and extension 

of completion date  and the NPDC’s approval of the suspension of work and 

extension of completion date as required under items 9 and 10 of the RIRR of RA 

No. 9184.  Details are as follows:

7.8 Allegedly, suspension of work was due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Enhanced 
Community Quarantine which resulted to closure of parks but the Management 

did not attach/provide the necessary documents for the suspension of work and 

extension of completion date of the projects nor any communication from the 

contractor requesting the extension of work thereof. 

 

7.9 It was also noted that the project Improvement of Open Air Auditorium – Lot 2 in 
the amount of P8,358,312.06 lack the documentary requirements for the variation 

orders/changes in the scope of work and Bill of Quantities as required in Section 

9.1.1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. 

 

7.10 Section 1.1.1, Annex of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 provides that Variation Orders 
may be issued by the procuring entity to cover any increase/decrease in quantities, 

including the introduction of new work items that are not included in the original 

contract or reclassification of work items that are either due to change of plans, 

design or alignment to suit actual field conditions resulting in disparity between 

the preconstruction plans used for purposes of bidding and the "as staked plans" 

or construction drawings prepared after a joint survey by the contractor and the 

Government after award of the contract, provided that the cumulative amount of 

the positive or additive Variation Order does not exceed ten percent (10%) of the 

original contract price. 

 

7.11 Section 9.1.1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 provides the 
additional documentary requirements for Variation Order/ Change Order/ Extra 

Work Order.  

 

7.12 Verification of documents submitted for the payment of the project Improvement 
of Open Air Auditorium–Lot 2 under Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) No. 01-2020-

12-0763 dated December 1, 2020 revealed that variation orders/changes in the 

scope of work and Bill of Quantities for the project were not attached to the 

disbursement vouchers amounting P1,332,167.95, as required in Annex E of the 

same RIRR of RA No. 9184 and Section 9.1.1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 

dated June 14, 2012. 

 

7.13 Absence of documentary evidence in the payment of expenditures creates doubts 
on its propriety and may be a ground for issuance of Notice of Suspension/Notice 

of Disallowance. 

 

7.14 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. comply with the period of action of the procurement activities as 
provided in Annex C of RA No. 9184 and its RIRR;  

 

b. submit the required supporting documents for the grant of contract time 
extensions for the projects “Rehabilitation of Water & Sprinkler System, 

Dredging and Waterproofing of Lagoon” and “Landscape & Park 



66 

 

Redevelopment of Light and Sound Complex”, and for the variation/ 

change orders in the scope of work and Bill of Quantities for the project 

“Improvement of Open Air Auditorium – Lot 2” to support the claim in 

compliance with Section 9.1.1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 and the 

RIRR of RA No. 9184; and 

 

c. indicate the dates in the Bid Evaluation Sheet and Post-Qualification 
Reports when the TWG members signed the reports.  

 

Management Comments 

 

7.15 The Management emailed and submitted the scanned copies of Suspension Orders 
and Resumption Orders on April 22, 2021 for the projects Rehabilitation of Water 

& Sprinkler System, Dredging and Waterproofing of Lagoon and Landscape & 

Park Redevelopment of Light and Sound Complex. Likewise, the scanned copies 

of required variation/change orders in the scope of work and bill of quantities for 

the project Improvement of Open Air Auditorium–Lot 2 was also emailed. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

7.16 The submitted documents are subject to further verification of the auditor and 
technical review of the COA Technical Services Office. 

 

 

Compliance with Other Government Rules and Regulations  

 

8. The status of NPDC’s compliance with other laws, rules and regulations (LRRs) 
is shown in the next table: 

 

LRRs  
Audit Observations and 

Recommendations 

Compliance with Property Insurance Law (RA No. 656) 

COA Circular No. 92-390 dated November 17, 

1992 and RA No. 656, otherwise known as 

Property Insurance Law, as amended by PD No. 

245, require all government agencies for the 

inventory of physical assets and to insure with 

General Insurance Fund of GSIS all its insurable 

property against any insurable risk and pay the 

corresponding premiums thereon. 

 

The NPDC had adequately covered/insured all 

of its insurable assets and properties with the 

General Insurance Fund of the GSIS in CY 

2020.  

 

As per verification, all of the insurable 

properties of NPDC were insured with the 

General Insurance Fund of the GSIS. As of 

December 31, 2020, NPDC paid insurance 

premiums totaling P824,815.23 for its insurable 

assets with a value of P204,031,481.79.  

 

We commended Management for 

substantially insuring its properties with the 

General Insurance Fund of GSIS in 

compliance with RA No. 656.

LRRs  
Audit Observations and 

Recommendations 

Compliance on Gender and Development (GAD) Program 

Section 31 of RA No. 11465 or otherwise 

known as the GAA of FY 2020 requires, among 

others, all agencies of the government to 

integrate GAD Plan in the regular activities of 

the agencies and allocate at least five percent 

(5%) of their budgets.  

 

PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 

which prescribes the guidelines for the 

preparation of Annual GAD Plan and Budget 

(GPB), requires the submission of the GPB duly 

reviewed by GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) 

to the PCW for review prior to the submission 

of the agency budget proposal to the 

Department of Budget and Management 

(DBM), which served as the basis for 

implementing the GPB as well as monitoring 

and reporting.  

The NPDC Management spent a total of 

P19,874,149.21 or 8.36 percent out of the total 

P237,600,927.00 CY 2020 agency budget to 

fund its GAD programs/projects.  

 

Seventeen of the 19 GAD-related programs, 

projects and activities for CY 2020 were 

implemented while two (2) were not 

implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic 

and in compliance to the Inter-Agency Task 

Force (IATF) guidelines which did not allow 

below 15 years old and above 65 years old in 

establishments and public spaces, which is 

beyond the control of the Agency.  

 

We commended Management for their 

efforts on the following: 

 

a. allocating more than five percent (5%) of 

the Agency’s budget for implementation 

of GAD programs and activities; 

 

b. continues monitoring of the 

implementation of GAD programs and 

activities in accordance with the GAD 

Plan and Budget; and 

 

c. the new Chairperson of the GAD FPS, for 

complying with the timely submission of 

the GAD Plan and Budget for CY 2021 as 

well as the GAD Accomplishment Report 

for CY 2020 through the Gender 

Mainstreaming Monitoring System 

(GMMS) to be approved/ endorsed by the 

PCW. 

 

Compliance on Programs and Projects for Senior Citizens (SCs) and Differently-Abled Persons 

Section 32 of the General Provisions of the 

GAA of FY 2020 or RA No. 11465 states - “all 

agencies of the government shall formulate 

plans, programs and projects intended to address 

the concerns of senior citizens and persons with 

disability, insofar as related to their mandated 

functions, and integrate the same in their regular 

activities.” 

 

The agency complied with the implementation 

of programs, projects and activities for senior 

citizens and differently-abled persons.  

 

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic which 

prompted the closure of the park during the 

ECQ, NPDC has formulated two (2) activities 

through webinar sessions, two (2) activities on 

their online Facebook page, and video 

presentation about the Senior and Person with 

Disability (PWD) friendly places in Luneta 

posted on the NPDC website.  Further, prior to 

the COVID-19 pandemic, NPDC was able to 

hire two (2) PWDs, provide senior citizens and 

PWDs with access/ ramps at the Light and 

Sound Complex and provide transportation

for the months of November and December 

2020. 

 

We commended Management for its support 

and implementation of programs, projects 

and activities benefiting the senior citizens 

and differently-abled persons. 

 

Compliance with BIR Revenue Regulation No. 1-2013  

BIR Revenue Regulation No. 1-2013 dated 

January 23, 2013 provides that – “in the case of 

NGAs, all returns must be electronically filed 

(e-filed) and payment of the tax due must also 

be made on the same day the return is e-filed 

which shall be on or before the 10th day 

following the month in which withholding was 

made, except for taxes withheld for the month 

of December of each year, which shall be filed 

on or before January 15 of the succeeding year.” 

 

NPDC strictly complied with the 

withholding/remittance of taxes within the 

prescribed period as provided under BIR 

Revenue Regulation No. 1-2013 dated January 

23, 2013.   

 

During the year, total taxes withheld amounted 

to P12,702,376.37 and the amount of 

P9,616,605.83 were remitted within the 

prescribed period while the balance of

Enforcement of COA Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 

 

9. Management continuously failed to take appropriate action for the proper 

disposition of final and executory audit disallowances of P4,563,127.62 which 

remained unsettled for more than 15 years.  

 

9.1 Section 7.1 of the COA 2009 Revised Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of 
Account (RRSA), prescribed under Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 

2009, provides among others, that the head of the agency, who is primarily 

responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall 

ensure that the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within the 

prescribed period and all employees who are retiring or transferring to other 

agencies shall first settle the disallowances and charges for which they are liable.  

 

9.2 Also, Section 7.2 of the said COA 2009 Revised RRSA provides that the Chief 
Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting 

and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that the audit 

suspensions, disallowances and charges including their settlements are properly 

monitored. 

 

9.3 As such, the prior years’ balance of Receivables-Disallowances and Charges 
account amounting to P4,563,127.62 remained outstanding as at December 31, 

2020. Details are shown below:

Total 4,563,127.62 - 4,563,127.62 

 

9.4 In the absence of documents to support the long outstanding audit disallowances 
that are already final and executory, the same had remained outstanding for more 

than 15 years. However, despite of our previous years’ recommendation, 

Management again was not able to make representations with the COA General 

Counsel for the proper disposition of the said disallowances. Management 

reasoned out that they have no documents to support the said disallowance; hence 

they could not make representation with the COA General Counsel. Although 

they have been digging from their records, still no records of the disallowance 

were found. Further, the balance of disallowances has been carried in the books of 

accounts since 2002.
