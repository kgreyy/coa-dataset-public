C)	Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the University for CY 2020 due to exceptions stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report as follows: a) the year-end balances of the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account, Accounts Receivable, Inventory accounts, Property, Plant and Equipment, Biological Assets, Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds and several General and Subsidiary Ledger accounts with abnormal/negative balances  were unreliable which affected the fair presentation of the financial statements.





D)	Significant Observations and Recommendations



		The following are the significant observations and recommendations which are discussed in detail in Part II of this Report:



1)		The year-end balance of the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account of P154,437,468.72 is not accurately presented in the financial statements because of (a) the discrepancy of P154,946,043.45 between the General Ledger (GL) balance and the bank confirmation due to reconciling items which have not been taken up; (b) the non-preparation of Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) of San Juan Campus covering the Calendar Years (CYs) 2009 to 2015; and (c) stale checks totaling P516,264.09 of Main, Bontoc and Tomas Oppus Campuses which are still reported as outstanding checks, thus affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements.



    We recommended that the University President require the:



a)	Accountants of all campuses to review and reconcile their records and make the necessary adjustments at the time the errors are detected to come up with correct and reliable balances of their Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account;

	

b)		Accountants of all campuses to account for the P154,946,043.45 unreconciled balance;

	

c)	Accountant of San Juan Campus to: 



1)	review and trace the entries appearing in the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) under the Regular Agency Fund, Internally Generated Fund and Inter-Agency Transferred Fund accounts and make the necessary adjustments; and 



2)	prepare and submit the BRS for CYs 2009 to 2015 and make the necessary adjustments in the books for errors/reconciling items detected to come up with correct and reliable balance of their Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account; and



d)		Accountants of Main, Bontoc and Tomas Oppus Campuses to make the necessary adjustments to take up the stale checks and all other reconciling items affecting the cash balance per books and consequently, record them in the General Journal. 



2)	The balance of the Accounts Receivable account reported at P18,725,831.48 as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to:  (a) the existence of negative balances totaling P6,651,684.74 from unrecorded transactions; and (b) unreconciled discrepancies in the balances between the GL of the Main Campus and the SLs of External Campuses amounting to P225,363.00, thus affecting the fair presentation of the account in the financial statements.



We recommended that the President require the Accountants to reconcile records of the SLSU-Main Campus with those of the External Campuses to detect reconciling items early and thereafter, effect the necessary adjustments; and to conduct periodic reconciliation to ensure correctness of the reported receivables as of a given date. 



3)	The year-end balance of the Inventory accounts amounting to P13,678,114.88 cannot be relied upon because of the following deficiencies:  (a)  absence of reconciliation between the Accounting and the Supply Offices records for all campuses resulting in a discrepancy of P9,872,995.96 between the records;  (b) the non-moving accounts totaling P2,582,252.23; and (c) the existence of negative balances of P190,935.47, thus affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements.



    We recommended that the President require the:



a)	Supply Officers of the different campuses to conduct a complete physical inventory of all their inventory items,  and to submit the Report of Physical Count of Inventories immediately to the Accounting Office for reconciliation; and



b)	Accountants  in the various campuses to make the necessary adjustments where necessary, so that more accurate account balances are  reported.



4)	The University’s assertions of existence, ownership and accuracy of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account reported at a net value of P555,898,789.43 as of year end cannot be relied upon due to: a) the discrepancies  in PPE balances carried in the CY 2020 financial statements and in the Report of Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE)of several campuses totaling P81,784,932.34; b) the failure to conduct an inventory of all PPE items by Main and Bontoc Campuses; c) the existence of unreconciled balances between the accounting records of Main Campus and those of the External Campuses totaling P40,921,910.13; and d) unserviceable properties totaling P3,928,804.14 which are still carried in the books.





     We recommended that the President require:



a)	the Supply Officers and the Inventory Committees of the various campuses to conduct an inventory of all PPEs and render a report thereon using the correct format and within the prescribed period in conformity with the pertinent provisions in the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I;



b)	the Inventory Committees of  the Main and Bontoc Campuses to prepare and to submit the RPCPPEs within the reglementary period pursuant to Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I;



c)	the Supply Officers and the Accountants of the various campuses to update their Property Ledger Cards and records, and to investigate the discrepancies in balances of their PPE items and make the necessary reconciliation of their records to come up with correct and reconciled balances; and



d)	the Inventory Committees of all the campuses to undertake disposal proceedings and subsequently, to submit duly accomplished Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property to the Accounting Office for the latter to drop the unserviceable items from the SLSU books, in compliance with Section 40, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.  



5)		The valuation and correctness of the Biological Assets account totaling P606,773.50 could not be ascertained due to the following deficiencies: (a) non-recording of any transaction in the account since CY 2014; (b) failure to update property cards; (c) absence of inventory records at the Bontoc Campus; and (d) the non-submission of Quarterly Report of Biological Assets (QRBA) from all campuses, thereby affecting the fair presentation of the account in the financial statements.

		

	     We recommended that the President require:



a)	the respective caretakers of the campuses to prepare and submit  the QRBA to the Accounting Unit;



b)	the Supply Officers of the Hinunangan and Bontoc Campuses to conduct a physical inventory of the biological assets, and to maintain updated property cards for each of the assets; and



c)	the Accounting Unit to prepare journal entry vouchers to recognize the gain or loss of the biological assets due to physical changes.



6)	The reported year-end balances of the reciprocal accounts, Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds amounting to P25,081,708.17 and P4,170,488.38, respectively, have remained unreconciled.

 

    We recommended that the President require the Accountants concerned to reconcile the reciprocal accounts of Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds by tracing the discrepancies and effecting their immediate adjustments in the books.  Thereafter,  the Accountants should closely monitor the recording of all transactions,  and effect the periodic reconciliation of the accounts to ensure the accuracy of the account balances in the financial statements.



7)	Several GL and SL balances totaling P17,403,176.87, reported abnormal negative balances as of year end.



     We recommended that the President require the Accountants of all campuses to:



1)	review the recording of transactions in their individual records with reference to the pertinent source documents and trace the cause of the errors and record the corrections immediately so that these accounts are accurately presented; and



2)	conduct periodic reconciliation of  their records so that errors are immediately corrected and accounts are fairly presented in the financial statements in  accordance with Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and pertinent provisions of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1.

         

8)	Payments of financial assistance for the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Tertiary Education Subsidy and for the CHED Tulong Dunong scholars totaling ₱3,490,000.00 were made through cash advances granted to the Cashiers of Bontoc, Hinunangan and San Juan Campuses,  resulting in the late receipt of the financial assistance by the scholars and in the delayed liquidation of the cash advances.



                We recommended that the President direct the Cashiers of Bontoc, Hinunangan and San Juan Campuses to implement fully the Expanded Modified Direct Payment Scheme for Accounts Payable due its creditors/payees, particularly its government scholars, in compliance with Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Circular Letter No. 2013-16 to expedite timely release of financial assistance to the grantee-scholars.



9)	Purchase Orders (POs) for goods totaling P3,066,031.97 did not indicate the dates of receipt by the suppliers, hence, the Audit Team could not determine whether these goods were delivered according to the contract.



     We recommended that the President require the Supply Officers of San Juan and Hinunangan Campuses to ensure that all POs issued to the suppliers are acknowledged by them by indicating therein the date of actual receipt; likewise, to ensure that these forms are filled out with the necessary/data in accordance with Appendix 61 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II.   



10)	Only 36.72% of the allocation for Gender and Development (GAD) Programs, Activities and Projects identified in the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) amounting to P20,111,284.32 was utilized.  The University’s GPB was not endorsed by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW); further, the University failed to use the HGDG Tool in attributing costs of major programs. 



  We recommended that the President require the GAD Focal Point System and other personnel concerned to strictly follow the provisions of PCW-National Economic Development Authority-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 in the determination of actual expenditures that can be attributed to the GAD budget, and that which can be reported in the GAD Accomplishment Report with the use of the HGDG Tool.



	  We also recommended that the President require the GAD Focal Person to ensure that the GPB is reviewed and endorsed by PCW before its implementation, and a copy of the approved plan be submitted to the Audit Team within the prescribed period. 

	

11)	Disbursement vouchers and their supporting documents, and accounting reports were not submitted within the reglementary period, precluding the prompt audit of accounts and financial transactions, early detection and correction of errors/deficiencies and timely reporting of the audit results to management.

          

    We recommended that the President require the Accountant of Tomas Oppus Campus to:



1)	Submit immediately the CY 2020 financial reports, and the related transaction documents to COA within the schedules enumerated under Section 122 of PD No. 1445; Section 7.2.1 (a) of COA Circular No. 2009-006; and Section 7 of Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1; and



2)	Undertake the appropriate action against the accountable officers concerned for their failure to comply with the provisions of the aforementioned law, rules and regulations.



		The above audit observations and recommendations were communicated to management through Audit Observation Memoranda which the agency officials answered and their comments were considered in the report, where appropriate.
