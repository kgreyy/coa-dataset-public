AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



FINANCIAL AUDIT



1)	Various accounts of the Jose Rizal Memorial State University (JRMSU) System  have misstatements amounting to P546.943 million, understating total Assets and Equity by P207.643 million  and P402.757 million, respectively,  and overstating total Liabilities by  P195.114 million, and accounting deficiencies affecting accounts amounting to P1,098.062 million have significant impact on Management’s assertions on  accuracy, completeness and existence of the reported account balances thus, adversely affecting  the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements (FS).  



	1)	Paragraph 27, International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1. Presentation of FS provides that the “FS shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out in the IPSAS.  The application of IPSASs, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in FS that achieve a fair presentation.”



	2)	Moreover, Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provide that the accounts of the agency shall be kept in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the Agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by the fiscal or control Agencies of the government; and that   highest standard of honesty objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate and misleading information. Each Agency shall record its financial transactions and conformably with IPSAS and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations.



	3)	Full disclosure principle is one of the generally accepted accounting principles that require organizations to disclose all the information that would affect a reader’s understanding of the FS.



	4)	The audit of accounts and transactions of the University disclosed various errors and omissions amounting  to P546.943 million (Annex A)  which were not adjusted by Management,  and accounting deficiencies amounting to  P1,098.062 million (Annex B) which have significant impact on management’s assertions on accuracy, completeness and existence of the reported account balances in the FS.  These are summarized in the following tables :

	5)	The above errors and deficiencies affected Management’s assertions on the FS that all transactions and events have been fully reported (completeness), were recorded without error (accuracy), within the correct reporting period (cut-off), in the proper accounts (classification), and actually took place (occurrence) and that all account balances exist (existence), and have significantly and adversely affected   the fair presentation of the year end FS. 





Cash in Bank – Local Currency Current Account (CIB-LCCA)



Unreliable balance of CIB-LCCA



2)	The CIB-LCCA has a total deficiency amounting to P286.094 million due to unrecorded reconciling items as addition to the said account in the amount of P276.524 million covering various funds, unaccounted variance of P1.071 million, unadjusted stale checks in the amount of P7.750 million and negative balance of P0.679 million.



	1)	The IPSAS set out the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements for financial reporting in the Philippine Government.



	2)	Paragraph 27 of IPSAS 1 – Presentation of FS provides that, “FS shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flow of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out in IPSASs.”



Understated CIB-LCCA – P276.524 million



	3)		Verification of accounts based on the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) and accounting records disclosed that the CIB-LCCA account is understated by P276.524 million which affects the reliability of CIB balance as presented in the Statement of Financial Position (SFP) as of December 31, 2020, summarized in the table below:

	6)	Management was not able to make the necessary adjustment in the CIB-LCCA account of JRMSU Main Campus. Considering the materiality of the unrecorded reconciling items, it renders the CIB balance unreliable.



	7)	In our query, the Accountant of the Main Campus confirmed the presence of reconciling items as well as the understatement and informed that they will adjust their books of account in Calendar Year (CY) 2021.



Unadjusted book reconciling items in the amount of P43,507.83 – Tampilisan Campus

Unaccounted variance between recorded book balance and balance per audit of P1.071 million – Siocon Campus



	10)	The CIB-LCCA account of the Siocon Campus had a balance of P14.874 million in the Consolidated SFP as of December 31, 2020. Review and verification of records revealed that the book balance of CIB – LCCA should have been P15.945 million with a difference of P1.071 million as detailed in the table below:

Unadjusted stale checks in the amount of P7.750 million



	11)	Section 44, Chapter 6, Volume 1 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) provides that checks may be cancelled when they become stale. The depository bank considers a check stale, if it has been outstanding for over six months from date of issue or as prescribed.



	12)	Review of the list of outstanding checks as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that stale checks totaling P7.75 million had not been cancelled and adjusted in the books of accounts, as presented in the table below:

	13)	In our query, Management informed that communication will be sent to various payees to know the status of the outstanding checks and will make the necessary adjustment.



	14)	Outstanding checks of more than six months, if not adjusted will continue to appear as reconciling items. Thus, until the reconciling items are translated into proper accounting adjustments, the CIB balance remains inaccurate. 



Negative balance of P0.679 million



	15)	Review of SL balances as of December 31, 2020 disclosed negative balances totaling P0.679 million as presented in the table below:

	16)	In our query, the Accountant informed that the negative balances were due to errors in accounting entries, and that reconciliation is on-going. Management also informed that the negative balance for Siocon Campus was due to the transaction that happened in December 7, 2017 when the GF-LBP-Zamboanga City account was closed, and an improper accounting entry was made.



	17)	We noted the explanation of Management, but we emphasized that bank and book balance in normal situation will not be in the same amount due to existing reconciling items that need to be addressed through reconciliation and timely adjusting/correcting entries.



Dormant bank accounts



	18)	Commission on  Audit  (COA)  Circular No. 2015–001 dated  January 29, 2015,  “…  prescribes the accounting guidelines and procedures in the reversion to the GF of all dormant cash balances, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary special and TFs maintained by national government agencies (NGAs) with depository banks.”



	19)	We noted that there are dormant bank accounts of the JRMSU System as presented in the table below:

	20)	In our query, Management informed that the dormant account was formerly used by the Main Campus as depositary for terminal benefit payments to its officials and employees but with the implementation of “List of Due and Demandable Accounts Payable – Advice to Debit Account” (LDDAP – ADA) disbursement system, this bank account  became dormant.



	21)	In Katipunan Campus, Management informed that the GF used to be the MDS account of the school, but since it was converted as one of the campuses of the JRMSU System, only the Main Campus was required to maintain an MDS account.  Another dormant account is the STUFAP for loans granted to poor but deserving students of the University. Management further informed that the GF is to be returned to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr), and the STUPAF funds shall be returned to the source agency which is the Commission on Higher Education (CHED).



	22)	For the Siocon Campus, Management communicated with DBP Zamboanga City regarding its dormant account, with an urgent request for Statement of Account (SOA). Management stated that the DBP account remained dormant because there were no available bank book or bank statement that could be found. As was instructed previously, these accounts should be left untouched since this will be returned back to the BTr, and available passbooks of these DBP accounts already have punched holes.



	23)	Considering the nature of the CIB account, Management should have considered the audit issues as priority since these were included in audit reports of prior years’. These issues related to the CIB account were already brought to the attention of Management but appropriate action has not been undertaken.



Recommendations



	24)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	Record in the books reconciling items such as unrecorded deposits, collections and credit memos for the CIB account to be fairly presentated in the FS;



b)	Adjust the books of accounts for stale checks  and other reconciling items to reflect  accurate  cash balance at year-end;



c)	Analyze and verify the details of accounts with negative balances and make appropriate adjustments thereon; and



d)	Determine the nature of the transactions comprising the cash balances of dormant accounts and revert the amounts to the National Treasury or to the source agency based on the guidelines and procedures on reversion   in COA Circular No. 2015-001.





Unreliable balance of Receivables Account  



3)	The accuracy of the Receivables account in the amount of P152.205 million presented in the SFP as of December 31, 2020 is doubtful due to unsubstantiated or undocumented amount of P7.013 million, unreconciled amount of P0.259 million, misclassified amount of P29.873 million, non-moving/dormant accounts of P47.191 million, non-provision for impairment loss for long dormant uncollected receivables of P18.960 million, over–provision of impairment loss – P64,259.67, presence of negative balances totaling P27,146.15 in its various accounts, and understated receivables for Audit Disallowances/ Charges account by P1.271 million.



	1)	As of December 31, 2020, JRMSU System reported a balance of P152.205 million of its Receivable Accounts. Details are shown in the table below:

Unsubstantiated or undocumented receivable of P7.013 million



	2)	Upon verification of the reported year-end balance of the receivables amounting to P152.185 million, we noted that P7.013 million is not supported with details like the name of the debtors comprising the amount. The breakdown is as follows:

	3)	The amount of P1.935 million of the Main Campus cannot be substantiated due to the absence of SLs in the Accounting Unit. The Accounting Unit maintained schedules or lists of individual accounts but no SLs were being maintained wherein individual accounts can be monitored and updated.  This condition has already been existing before the Accountant of the Main Campus assumed office and no schedule or record was turned-over to him by the former Accountant.



	4)	Likewise, no SLs/schedule of AR or any documents to support the recorded amount of P5.078 million for the Katipunan Campus. This condition affects the verifiability of the accounts and monitoring of each receivable account.



Non-reconciliation of AR account – P0.259 million



	5)	Further verification revealed that the year-end balance of AR amounting to P1.930 million differed from the submitted schedule by P0.259 million, details are shown in the table below:

	6)	The campuses committed to reconcile the accounts and records and to make the necessary adjustments of the difference. In view of this condition, it will have an impact on the reported account balances as to accuracy, completeness and existence.



	Misclassification of accounts in the amount of P29.873 million

	

	7)		Republic Act No. (RA) 10931, otherwise known as Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act exempts all Filipino students who are enrolled in courses in pursuance of a bachelor’s degree, certificate degree, or any comparable undergraduate degree in any state universities and colleges (SUCs) and local universities and colleges (LUCs) from paying tuition and other school fees, provided that they pass the entrance examination and other admission and retention requirements of the SUCs and LUCs. Under this Act the government, thru the CHED shall pay the SUCs the tuition and other school fees of actual qualified enrollees.  Under this scheme, the JRMSU submits its billing to the CHED as a basis of the latter to pay the former and it is now the CHED, a NGA, which is responsible for the payment of accounts to the JRMSU. 

	

	8)		Meanwhile, Senior High School (SHS) Voucher Program (VP) is a program of financial assistance wherein subsidies in the form of vouchers are provided to qualified SHS learners in participating private or non-Department of Education (DepEd) public SHSs.

	

	9)		A subsidy is given by the State to qualified Grade 10 completers to enable them to enroll in a non-DepEd SHS of their choice. The assistance helps to defray the cost of tuition and all other published fees charged by a non-DepEd SHS. The subsidy is not given to the learner as cash; DepEd instead pays directly to the non-DepEd SHS where the learner enrolls.

	

	10)		The Audit Team verified transactions recorded in the GL of the AR account in Special TF of the Main Campus and noted that a debit to the account was made in the amount of P29.873 million which pertains to the Free Higher Education and SHS VP. Details are as follows:

	11)	The amount billed to CHED and DepEd for the free tuition fees of enrolled students of JRMSU - Dapitan Campus was recorded as AR instead of Due from NGAs  which is not in consonance with  Chapter 3, Volume III of GAM for NGAs.



Non-moving/Dormant accounts – P47.191 million



	12)	Further verification and analysis of Receivables account disclosed that a total of P47.191 million had been outstanding for more than 3 years. Details are shown in the table below:

	13)	The submitted schedule by the Main Campus disclosed that the accounts are mostly receivables from tuition fees before the Free Higher Education Program was implemented and students were classified as paying.



	14)	Also, review of the schedule submitted and confirmed by Tampilisan Campus revealed that GF amounting P12,600.00 is a collectible from the Teachers and Employees of JRMSU-Tampilisan Campus. However, the former failed to provide the complete list of the persons liable. The Accountant commented that she will verify this account as well as the schedule maintained to reconcile records.



	15)	Meanwhile, the P211,000.00 pertains to Safe Loans, wherein a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was entered into by each student with JRMSU-Tampilisan Campus to borrow/loan as much as P8,000.00, depending on the individual circumstances, to defray the minimal educational expenses of the students. As per guidelines of CHED, a notarized promissory note will be signed by the student for repayment within two to five years after graduation. However, the submitted sample MOA was not notarized and it stated that the amount due will be payable within a period before the final examination of the School Year when it was borrowed which not in accordance with the CHED Memorandum.



	16)	Tampilisan Campus informed that they already sent communications to some of the borrowers, and for CY 2020 a collection was made amounting to P20,000.00. Meanwhile, Siocon Campus disclosed that there was no available document that can substantiate the existence of the Other Receivables account amounting to P293,412.20.



Non-provision for impairment loss on dormant and long outstanding receivables –     P18.960 million



	17)	Verification of the submitted schedule of receivables disclosed that receivables amounting to P18.960 million were outstanding for more than three years. Details are presented in the table below:

	18)	Section 10, Chapter 7, Volume I of GAM for NGAs provides that “an entity shall assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. If any such evidence exists, the entity shall measure the amount of loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset shall be reduced either directly or through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss shall be recognized in surplus or deficit. In case of Accounts Receivable, the Allowance for Impairment shall be provided in an amount based on collectability of receivable balances and evaluation of such factors as aging of accounts, collection experiences of the agency, expected loss experiences and identified doubtful accounts.”



	19)	As the standards require, the agency is responsible for assessing or identifying at the end of the year the uncertainty of the collectability of accounts.  We observed, however, that no provision has been recognized by the agency to provide for possible loss on uncollected long outstanding AR.



	20)	The Audit Team also noted that there is no approved documented policy in setting up Allowance for Impairments for accounts that may not be collected in the future. 



	21)	In our query, the bookkeeper of Dipolog Campus who assumed office on September 2018, disclosed that upon assumption there was no Schedule of AR being prepared, nor was there a turn-over of the details of the recorded AR.



Over-provision of impairment loss – P64,259.67



	22)	On the other hand, the Audit Team noted that the impairment loss recognized by Siocon Campus exceeded the ending balance of AR by P64,259.67. Details are shown below:

	23)	This resulted to a negative net value of AR, thus affecting the fair presentation of the account in the FS. The Campus Bookkeeper commented that reconciliation and necessary adjusting entries will be made.



Negative balance of Receivable Accounts of P27,146.15



	24)	The Audit Team also noted a total of P27,146.15 negative credit balance in the Receivable Accounts as of December 31, 2020. Details are shown in the table below:

	25)	The bookkeeper of the Dipolog Campus commented that this balance has been outstanding since 2015 when she assumed office, and that further reconciliation of records will be undertaken and the corresponding adjusting/correcting entries to address the negative balance will be made.



	26)	Although actions were partially taken by Management, further verification, review, analysis and reconciliation of the composition of the Receivable accounts are necessary, particularly on the unaccounted, abnormal account balances and dormant/long outstanding accounts. 



	27)	The foregoing deficiencies affect Management’s assertions on accuracy, existence, valuation and completeness thereby rendering the Receivables account as of December 31, 2020, unreliable.



Understated Receivables for Audit Disallowances/Charges by P1.271 million



	28)	COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 states that “the Chief Accountant, on the basis of the NFD, record in the books of accounts, the disallowance and/or charges as a receivable”.



	29)	Verification of the year-end FS of Dipolog Campus showed that the Receivables-Disallowances/Charges account has an ending balance of P280,544.27 as of December 31, 2020. However, based on the Report on Enforcement of Final and Executory Decisions (REMFED) as of December 31, 2020, the unsettled balance of disallowances with Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) is P1.552 million. Details are presented in the table below:

	30)	Further verification disclosed that an adjusting entry was made by the Accounting Unit on December 31, 2020 amounting to P280,544.27 to record the disallowances previously recorded in Other Receivables account. As can be gleaned from the table above, the Receivables-Disallowances/Charges account is understated by P1.271 million.



	31)	In our query, the bookkeeper informed that the above understatement was not yet recoded because they are still collating the necessary documents for the reconciliation of the account.	



Recommendations



	32)	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accounting Unit to:



a)	Exert effort to identify the person/s with unpaid balance to substantiate the AR account and maintain and prepare regularly an updated Schedule of AR;



b)	Make the necessary adjusting entries to reclassify AR to Due from NGAs and maintain and update the SLs or other equivalent accounting records;



c)	Obtain relevant documents validating the existence of the conditions that would warrant the write – off under Section 8.3 of COA Circular No. 2006-005 and thereafter, file the necessary request for authority to write-off upon compliance with all documentary requirements; and



d)	Analyze all receivables that are dormant, long outstanding and unsubstantiated for proper disposition and derecognition as well as the negative/abnormal balances and effect the necessary adjusting/correcting entries. 



Management Comments



	33)	The Katipunan Campus commented that the Accounting Unit will coordinate with the Registrar and the Cashier to determine which of the accounts are paying and which are subsidized, and to reclassify the accounts of subsidized students to the Due from NGAs account.  Management will also send demand letters to debtors for receivables from prior years to assess its collectability and to verify the accuracy of the receivables account.



	34)	The Tampilisan Campus admitted that there is a need to thoroughly review and trace pertinent records and documents to support these balances. If collection is possible, demand letters will be issued to the concerned Teachers and Employees.



	35)	The Main Campus commented that they already instructed the Accounting Unit to address the concerns and comply with the recommendations issued by COA.





Unreliable balance of Advances Accounts – P44.315 million



4)	The accuracy and existence of the Advances accounts amounting to P44.315 million presented in the SFP is doubtful due to a) unreconciled amount of P17.377 million; b) presence of negative balance in the amount of P0.583 million; c) error in recording of P0.797 million; d) absence of details supporting the balance of P0.779 million; and e) non-moving account of P38,439.82.



	1)	As of December 31, 2020, the SFP showed that the unliquidated cash advances (CAs) of the JRMSU System has a balance of P44.315 million as detailed in the following table:

Management informed they will conduct further reconciliation to determine the difference and make the necessary adjusting/ correcting entries.



Abnormal negative balance of P0.583 million – Main Campus



	4)	The Audit Team also noted that a negative credit balance of Advances to Officers and Employees in the Special TF of the Main Campus increased by P469,301.98 as of December 31, 2020, as shown in the table below:

Error in Recording – P0.797 million 



	6)	Advances to Contractors account of the Dipolog Campus was also verified and we noted an understatement of P299,630.81. This amount was recorded as a debit to the PPE, specifically the Power Supply System account instead to the Advances to Contractors account, as  detailed in the table below:

Undocumented and Unreconciled Advances- P0.779 million – Siocon Campus 



	8)	Review of the Advances account of JRMSU System in the SFP and its corresponding supporting schedules disclosed that out of the P44.315 million year-end balance, the amount of P0.779 million was not supported with schedules, SLs and other details which would substantiate the recorded balance.  



	9)	The Accountant of the Siocon Campus commented that these balances were already existing before assumption to office, and no schedule was given as part of the turn-over documents by her predecessor, thus the reported balance could not be verified.



Non-moving balance – P38,439.82



	10)	We also noted an unliquidated CAs amounting P9,421.00 for the Main Campus and P29,018.82 for Dipolog Campus that had been outstanding for five years. The Accounting Units of the campuses informed that the accountable officers (AOs) concerned were already deceased employees thus collection is uncertain.







Recommendations



	11)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	Exert more effort to account for the undocumented and unreconciled balances and effect the necessary adjusting/correcting entries, to present accurate and reliable account balances in the FS of the JRMSU System; and



b)	Request for write-off of the long outstanding/dormant CAs following the procedures embodied under COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.

	

	

	Unreliable Inventory Accounts 

	

5)	The accuracy and existence of the reported balance of various Inventory accounts with aggregate amount of P81.629 million of the JRMSU System could not be relied upon due to: a) inventories issued in previous  years and/or  non-existing inventories amounting to P70.749 million which were still recognized in the books; b) unverifiable inventory items by P0.721 million c) misclassified account in the amount of P196,596.00; and d) presence of non-moving account in the amount of P0.517 million. 

	

	1)		Section 58 of PD 1445 provides that the examination and audit of assets shall be performed with a view to ascertaining their existence, ownership, valuation and encumbrances as well as the proprietary of items composing the respective asset accounts, determining their agreement with records, proving the accuracy of such records; ascertaining if the assets were utilized economically, efficiently and effectively; and evaluating the adequacy of controls over the accounts.

	

	2)		The total inventory of the Main Campus and four campuses in the SFP as of December 31, 2020 is presented in the table below:

	3)	Among the assertions of Management is that the assets recognized in the FS exist at a given period and that transactions have been recorded accurately at their appropriate amounts. For this purpose, the agency is required to conduct physical inventory of its assets to attest to the fact that they are existing.



	4)	Review and reconciliation of Report of Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) and GL as of December 31, 2020 revealed a difference of P70.271 million as presented in the table:

	5)	The noted variance in the balance of Inventory accounts represents items not in the custody of the Supply Officer because accordingly, these have already been issued to the end users/campuses. 



	6)	This noted deficiency increased by P24.667 million as compared to the CY 2019 difference of P45.604 million as contained in the 2019 Annual Audit Report (AAR).



	7)	Verification disclosed several lapses in inventory record-keeping of the Main Campus that caused the material variance between the balance of Inventory accounts as recorded in the books and the balance as reported based on the records of the Supply Office as of December 31, 2020, as follows :



a)	The Accounting Unit of the Main Campus did not maintain Supply Ledger Cards (SLCs) despite having recorded in the books of accounts the amounts in connection with the procurement of supplies and inventories issued to campuses.   



b)	The Supply Unit did not maintain Supply Cards (SCs) for supplies and inventories procured and delivered to the campuses.  Hence, reconciliation could not be properly undertaken by the Accounting and Supply Units.



c)	Deliveries were made directly to the campuses and considering that procurement are also undertaken by these campuses, the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) was not prepared and submitted to the Accounting Unit by the Main Campus Supply Unit for issuances made to the campuses. As a result, the Accounting Unit could not make the necessary entries in the books upon issuance of supplies /materials/ inventories made to the different campuses.



	8)	The present set-up of JRMSU System is that all transactions pertaining to the GF are being controlled and recorded in the Main Campus. However, the procurement process, inspection and acceptance, safekeeping and releasing of Inventories as well as the preparation of documents are being undertaken by the respective campuses.



	9)	Our query with the Accounting Unit of the Main Campus disclosed that there has been no policy drafted to address this issue, and no reconciliation has been conducted between the Accounting and the Supply Units, which contributed to the increase of the deficiency year after year. Management explained that the non-maintenance of SLCs is due to heavy workload and lack of personnel in the Unit.  Management also commented that due to the present set-up, there is a big difference between the records of the Accounting and Supply Units since the records of the former include the Inventories of the External Campuses, while records of the latter only pertain to the Main Campus.



	10)	Meanwhile, the Management of Katipunan Campus commented that an actual physical count will be conducted and reconciliation will be done in the 3rd Quarter of CY 2021 between the Accounting and Supply Units to correct the records and reflect more reliable balances.



	11)	We emphasized that accounting records should be properly maintained to have accurate recording and fair presentation of inventory account in the FSs. Despite the recommendation provided in the CYs 2018 and 2019 AARs, which is to seriously formulate policy to streamline the proper control, monitoring and recording of inventories, no such Inventory Policy has been issued. Moreover, the importance of periodic reconciliation is stressed to check the accuracy of records and reported balances, detect possible errors and misstatements.



	12)	We also noted that Inventories amounting to P478,588.15 in the Dipolog Campus were not in the custody of the Supply Officer and accordingly, have already been issued to the end users with a corresponding Requisiton and Inventory Slip (RIS) issued as reflected in the SLCs of Dipolog Campus maintained by the Campus. Details are shown in the table below:

	13)		 In Dipolog Campus, Management commented that FOL Inventory amounting P52,224.15 were already consumed. However, the liquidation/ consumption report and supporting documents were not submitted to the Accounting Unit, thus the expense account was not recorded.



Unverifiable inventory items of P0.721 million – Dipolog Campus   



	14)	Audit disclosed that the Campus was not able to conduct the required physical count of inventories, hence, no RPCI was prepared and submitted as of December 31, 2020 and no SCs were maintained. However, the Supply Officer commented that a physical count will be conducted in the 2nd Quarter of 2021.



	15)	In the absence of the RPCI and SCs as of December 31, 2020, we conducted alternative audit procedures such as verification of SLCs to determine accuracy and existence of reported balance of inventories as of December 31, 2020. We noted that Inventories without SLCs increased by P0.721 million in CY 2020.  The following table shows the inventories with no SLC/SC.

	19)	The Accounting Unit did not provide any record to support the ending balances reported, and considering that the account has been for more than five years, these could be said to no longer exist.



Recommendations



	20)	We recommended and Management agreed to: 

	

a)		Reconcile procurement made by the JRMSU in the previous years, identify those forming part of the P70.271 million variance of inventory account, and prepare the necessary adjusting or correcting entries;

	

b)		Adopt a policy as to the custodian of the deliveries on procurement charged to the GF for JRMSU campuses, and submit monthly RSMI to include the supplies/ inventories issued and received by the different campuses;

	

c)		Derecognize from the books inventories on the basis of the RSMI submitted by the Supply Unit of the Main Campus of the supplies issued to the various campuses; 

	

d)		Maintain and update regularly SLCs and SCs, conduct periodic physical inventory, submit the required RPCI as required, and ensure periodic reconciliation of records to have timely detection of errors; and 

	

e)		Conduct of verification, review and analysis of dormant inventory account balances and effect necessary adjustments after compliance with the requirements on write-off/ derecognition.

	

	

	Unreliable PPE account – P679.533 million, net 

	

6)		PPE  presented in the FS at a net amount of P679.533 million as of December 31, 2020 is affected by a) the absence of PPE Ledger Card (PPELC) supporting the recorded PPE of P587.032 million ; b)  variance of P190.949 million  between the recorded PPE and result of physical count; c) errors in the recording of PPE amounting to P1.020 million; d) unrecorded PPE of P51,000.00; e) non-reclassification of completed projects amounting to P29.953 million; f)  non-recognition of depreciation expense of depreciable PPE component accounts in the amount of P118.223 million and understated depreciation of P251,000.00.

	

	1)		Section 42 of Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs requires that the Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain Property Card (PC) for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like Property Acknowledgement Report (PAR).

	

	2)		COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 prescribes the guidelines and procedures on inventory taking, recognition of those found at station and disposition for non-existing/missing PPE items for the one-time cleansing of PPE accounts of government agencies to establish PPE balances that are verifiable as to existence, condition and accountability. The Campuses are still in the process of reconciliation, verification, and preparation of records necessary to complete the process of one-time cleansing of PPE accounts.



	3)	The JRMSU System PPE account has a consolidated net amount of P679.533 million as presented in the SFP as of December 31, 2020.

	4)	In the audit of PPE and its sub accounts, the Audit Team validated the assertions of Management both qualitative and quantitative qualities on its consolidated FS. Review of the PPE component disclosed certain deviations from existing rules, regulations and standards pertaining to the recording and reporting aspect. These deficiencies are discussed in detail in the following paragraphs:

	

	Unverifiable PPE component accounts of P587.032 million

	

	5)	Reconciliation of amount in the GL and the PPELC of the Main Campus disclosed that the recorded PPE are unsubstantiated and could not be verified due to non – maintenance of PPELC. Thus, the ending balance of P439.887 million (excluding CIP) as of December 31, 2020 could not be relied upon.



	6)	The Audit Team also verifiedthe amount booked – up and the PPELC of two campuses, Dipolog and Katipunan.  This also revealed that there are component accounts of PPE which are not supported with PPELC, as presented in the table below:

	7)	The verification of the records of the two campuses also showed that the PPE without PPELC decreased by P30.736 million for CY 2020 as compared with CY 2019. Reconciliation of the accounts was made by the Accounting Unit of Katipunan Campus and they were able to identify some PPE, and provide PPELC as recommended in the previous year’s audit. Details are presented in the table below:

	8)	The unsubstantiated amount affects the accuracy and verifiability of the specific PPE accounts. In view of this condition, the impact will be significant on the reported balances, as to accuracy, completeness and existence of the said accounts. This condition will be addressed with the on-going implementation by the Campus of the one-time cleansing of PPE accounts under COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020.

	

	Difference of recorded PPE and the result of physical count of P190.949 million

	

	9)		Review of the balance per GL and the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE), excluding the CIP account of the Main Campus disclosed a difference of P207.248 million, as presented in the table below:

	12)		On the other hand, the reported balance of PPE in the SFP of Dipolog Campus could not be verified, due to the absence of the RPCPPE and PCs from the Supply Unit.

	

	13)		In response to our query, Management informed that the present set-up of JRMSU System is still the same as that of prior years, whereby the payment and recording of procurements under GF is being handled by the Main Campus.  There is a huge disparity between the records of the Accounting and Supply Unit, since the records of the former includes the PPE of the External Campuses procured from 2015 to the present, whereas the records and reports of the latter only contain data for the Main Campus.

	

	14)		As for Dipolog Campus, a physical count for CY 2020 was not conducted, however, an Inventory Committee was already created on March 19, 2021, and the conduct of physical count was scheduled on April 21-22, 26-27 and 28-29, 2021.

	

	15)		Management committed that they will conduct reconciliation of records to avail of the one-time cleansing of PPE accounts and effect the necessary adjustments on the difference.

	

	16)		We recognized the explanation of Management but we emphasize the importance of conducting periodic reconciliation to correct records between the Supply and Accounting Units of JRMSU System.

	

	Erroneous classification of PPE of P1.020 million – Dipolog Campus

	

	17)	Verification of PPELC of Dipolog revealed that various PPE in the amount of P1.020 million were not properly recorded to its proper accounts. Details are presented in in the tables below:

	18)		The PPE balance as of December 31, 2020 is overstated by P187,154.65 due to incorrect recording in the books of accounts. Management informed that they will make the necessary adjusting/correcting entry on their on-going cleansing of PPE accounts.

	

	19)		The errors noted and improper classification of PPE renders the reported balance as of December 31, 2020 unreliable and not in accordance with assertion of Management on proper presentation.

	

Unrecorded PPE of Siocon Campus amounting P51,000.00



	20)	We also noted procurement of PPE of Siocon Campus which is not recorded in the books of accounts as presented in the table below:

	Non – recognition of depreciation expense for PPE component accounts in the amount of P118.223 million



	27)	Volume I, Chapter 10 of GAM, Sec. 27 provides that PPE gradually loses its ability to provide service over the course of time. Because of this, its cost needs to be distributed on a systematic basis over its useful life.   The allocated cost is referred to as depreciation.  The depreciation charge for each period shall be recognized as expense unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset.  



	28)	COA Circular No. 2020-006 provides that "the unit value of articles/items counted shall be taken from the PPELCs/SLs or, if not available, from PCs or other property records. In case no such information could be found in both accounting and property records such as for PPE items found at station, the unit cost/value shall be established, as follows:



a)	Cost/value may be assigned by the Inventory Committee based on the market/fair value of the item. The cost/value of a similar item in the RPCPPE may also be used by the Inventory Committee.



The market/fair value is the estimated amount for which an asset could be exchanged on the date of valuation, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction; and



b)	If there are items for which market/fair value could not be easily determined by the Inventory Committee, the fair value shall be determined by appraisal.



An appraisal of the value of an asset us normally undertaken by a member of the valuation profession who holds a recognized ad relevant professional qualification. For many assets, the fair value will be readily ascertainable by reference to quoted prices in an active and liquid market. xxx



If no evidence is available to determine the market value in an active and liquid market of an item of property, the fair value of the item may be established by reference to other items with similar characteristics, in similar circumstances and location. In cases of specialized buildings and other man-made structures, fair value may be estimated using depreciated replacement cost, or the restoration cost or service unit approaches. In many cases, the depreciated replacement cost of an asset can be established by reference to the buying price of a similar asset with similar remaining service potential in an active and liquid market. In some cases, an asset's reproduction cost will be the best indicator of its replacement cost."



	29)	Audit of the balances of the PPE accounts for CY 2020 revealed that the following were not provided with depreciation:

	30)	In response to our query, Management informed that some of these PPE were already identified.  However, due to absence of the necessary data, no provision of depreciation was made for the PPE mentioned  to date. On the other hand, with the implementation of COA Circular No. 2020-006 to conduct of physical count, and with the procedural guidelines provided, adjustments will be made upon completion of the one – time cleansing of PPE accounts.



Understatement of recognized depreciation in Siocon Campus of P250,828.94



	31)	Verification of the Lapsing Schedule submitted by the Siocon Campus revealed that the computation of depreciation begins in the next month following the availability of the asset regardless of its date. Under the STF, depreciation expense for CY 2020 of PPE is understated by P250,828.94, details are presented in the table below:

	32)	Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.  For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, depreciation shall be for one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month.  However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, depreciation shall be for the succeeding month.



	33)	The non-provision of depreciation resulted to understated depreciation expense for the year and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) for the depreciation of prior years.



Recommendations



	34)	We recommended and Management agreed to accelerate the implementation of the one – time cleansing of PPE accounts to reconcile and cleanse the reported PPE account balances by:



a)	Conducting physical count and follow the procedural guidelines provided in COA Circular No. 2020-006; 



b)	Maintaining the required accounting records as provided under Volume II of GAM for NGAs; and



c)	Instituting and monitoring the conduct of periodic reconciliation between the Accounting and Supply Units.



	35)	We also recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Unit to conduct verification, review and analysis of PPE with no depreciation, recognize depreciation expense and effect necessary adjustment/correcting entries.



Management Comments



	36)	Katipunan Campus



Management commented that they will conduct a physical count of PPE to reconcile thelLedger balances, PPELC, and RPCPPE. Management also signified that they would like to request for the assessment of the value of Buildings and Other Structures at fair value because it could no longer locate the source documents of these buildings constructed in prior years, and the balance of the ledgers and RPCPPE of these accounts would not reconcile.



	37)	Tampilisan Campus



Management replied that due to lack of personnel, the Accounting unit is still in the process of updating its records. There are still items which should be accounted for as semi-expendable that need to be removed from the Lapsing schedule.





Unreliable liabilities 



7)	Total liabilities of the JRMSU System amounting to P379.123 million presented in the SFP as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to accounting errors and various deficiencies in the keeping of accounts amounting to P254.042 million.



	1)	The pertinent provisions on the propriety of charges to Liabilities are stated as follows:



Section 46 of PD 1177 provides that no obligation shall be certified to accounts payable unless the obligation is founded on a valid claim that is properly supported by sufficient evidence and unless there is proper authority for its incurrence. Any certification for a non-existent or fictitious obligation and/or creditor shall be considered void.



GAM Volume III provides that the Accounts Payable is used to recognize receipt of goods or services on account in the normal course of trade and business operations.



GAM Volume III provides that “Other Payables Account is used to recognize other liabilities not falling under any of the specific payable accounts.”



	2)	As of December 31, 2020, JRMSU System had Total Liabilities amounting to P379.123 million. Details shown in Table below:

	5)	Examination of records showed that of the P3.495 million payables beyond 360 days, an aggregate amount of P2.180 million are payables aged more than 2 years, withP2.171 million and P8,809.92 for the Main and Katipunan Campus, respectively. Payables that remained unpaid for two or more years maybe reverted, if these payables can be ascertained to be without valid claims.



	6)	The JRMSU Katipunan Campus mentioned that the payables to suppliers included amounts obligated for payment to emission centers for the application of license and registration of vehicle and car service, payment for printing t-shirts, and scholarship claim. The payables arose from stale checks of prior years which remained outstanding and unclaimed. These transactions are consummated and approved by the Campus’ authorized personnel. Earnest efforts to communicate with the creditors to receive the payments were not made by the Management.



	7)	Payables to individuals consisted of unclaimed salaries/allowances of officers/ employees, remittance of mandatory deductions, and payment to suppliers and contractors of prior years. It is unusual for these payables to remain unpaid and not be claimed by these creditors. It appears that there are no valid claimants, or the claimants are no longer interested to collect these payments considering the length of time the payables have been outstanding.



Financial Liabilities without specific details amounting to P5.246 million



	8)	Based on the review of the submitted detailed Schedule of Accounts Payable, Due to Officers and Employees and Other Payables accounts for CY 2020 of the three campuses, the Audit Team noted that the total balance does not jibe with the year-end balance of financial liability accounts reflected in the FS. We further noted that financial liability amounting to P5.246 million were not supported with specific details as shown in the table below:

	9)	The Bookkeeper of Dipolog Campus explained that the balances in the GL were just carried forward from the ending balance from prior years without specific details since CY 2017. The unsupported claims may be attributed to prior years’ balances which were not updated and reconciled prior to her assumption of office on September 2018. Several adjustments from observations of CY 2019 were already made, however the unidentified balance amounting to P25,843.73 were still in the books for CY 2020.



	10)	The Bookkeeper of the Tampilisan Campus explained that the Accounting Unit does not prepare Aging of Payables for Due to Officers and Employees. The Bookkeeper provided a copy of their SL which lumps all the transactions with the names of the employees as one. It is difficult to identify if the specific person has already received payment from prior year/s because the SL only includes the balance carried forward without details of the names of the person. The same is true with Other Payables account. Thus, a total of P1.170 million showed no specific details. 



	11)	On the other hand, the Bookkeeper of the Siocon Campus explained that there was no complete and updated SL when she took over the handling of the accounts. The unsupported claims are attributed to prior years’ balances. The lack of SL to back-up the accounts is one of the reasons why the balance as of year-end does not reconcile with the Schedule of Accounts Payable, Due to Officers and Employees and Other Payables. 



	12)	Management further informed that the posting of transactions to the GL is not done on a regular basis. It is done and completed only when the submission of financial report is required. The SLs are not regularly updated and there is no periodic reconciliation of SL balances with the control account, or the GL. Without the updated schedule, reconciliation of SL and GL cannot be attained.



Absence of SLs for Due to NGAs, GOCCs and LGUs account - P38.288 million

 

	13)	Section 98 of PD 1445 provides for the reversion of unliquidated balances of Accounts Payable as follows: 



“The Commission upon notice to the head of agency concerned may revert to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund of the national government, any unliquidated balance of accounts payable in the books of the national government, which has been outstanding for two years or more and against which no actual claim, administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by perfected contracts on record. This section shall not apply to unliquidated balances of accounts payable in trust funds as long as the purposes for which the funds were created have not been accomplished.”



	14)	COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 prescribes the rules and regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidations of funds transferred to an Implementing Agency (IA) and provides that the IAs shall return to the Source Agency (SA) any unused balance upon completion of the project.



	15)	Pertinent Sections of said Circular further requires that:



“4.6 Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds. Only actual project expenses shall be reported. The reports shall be approved by the Head of the IA. 



Xxx



4.9 The IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion of the project.”



	16)	JRMSU-Katipunan and Tampilisan Campus received funds from various NGAs, GOCCs and LGUs for the implementation of special projects by virtue of MOA. However, no MOA was furnished by the Management to the Audit Team to support the balances. 



	17)	The total outstanding balance of the accounts Due to NGAs, GOCCs and LGUs for the two campuses amounting to P38.288 million are also not supported with SLs and other specific details which render the accounts unreliable.  Details as follows:

	18)	Verification of the accounts Due to NGAs, LGUs and GOCC of the two campuses showed that these have been outstanding for more than two years. However, the remaining balance could not be ascertained due to the absence of information as to the amount per project or purpose of the fund. All the transactions were recorded as one and not per project, thus it is difficult to ascertain if there are remaining balances for specific projects that should be returned to the SA.



	19)	Inquiry with the Management revealed that these accounts had been in their books for a long period with no supporting documents; hence, could not be verified or validated. 



Abnormal/Negative balances of liability accounts amounting to P10.397 million



	20)	As of December 31, 2020, the Total Liabilities includes negative credit balance of P10.397 million per FS and GL as shown in the table below:

	21)	Considering that the above accounts should normally have credit balances, the negative credit balances indicate errors, such as overpayments, errors in recording long overdue liabilities, errors in recording payments of payables and other errors that were not reconciled and monitored from prior years.



	22)	Inquiry made with the Accountant disclosed that most of these negative balances already existed when he assumed at the Accounting Unit. However, they were not able to verify the causes of the negative balances on the above accounts due to lack of personnel who will handle the prior years’ reconciling items.



	23)	Absence of proper monitoring, reconciliation and control in the maintenance of accounts resulted in abnormal negative balances of various liability accounts which affect the accuracy and reliability of the liability accounts as of year-end.



No schedules submitted for Other Payables account for IGP of the Main Campus with an aggregate amount of P111,761.14



	24)	Account balances in the GL are the amounts to be reported in the FS. In turn, the GL is to be supported with SLs or pertinent schedule or listing. As defined under Appendix 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II, the SL shows detail for each control account in the GL which is maintained per account and fund cluster by the Accounting Division/Unit.



	25)	Examination of records showed that the Main Campus has the following balances of Other Payables account as of December 31, 2020:

	26)	The Accounting Unit submitted the Schedules and SLs for GF amounting to P1.156 million. However, no schedules were submitted in support of the year-end balance of IGP amounting to P111,761.14.



	27)	Review of the accounts and financial records of the University revealed the absence of several SLs which would have enabled tracing transactions to source documents, and details of the GL accounts. Absence of SLs affects proper monitoring, and the correctness of the year-end balances could not be ascertained.

Misclassification of Liabilities pertaining to Officers and Employees as Accounts Payable amounting to P0.520 million



	28)	Out of the total P2.197 million of Accounts Payable of the Dipolog Campus,  P0.520 million includes liabilities to officers and employees for salaries, benefits and other emoluments, including authorized expenses advanced by them. These were supposed to be charges to Due to Officers and Employees. However, it was noted, that the reported balance of the Due to Officers and Employees account does not reflect the actual financial obligation/liability to officers/employees of the Campus.  



	29)	The misclassification of this account resulted in the understatement of Due to Officers and Employees account and overstatement of Accounts Payable. Thus, resulted to misleading financial information for liability accounts.



Income from TF of Prior Year’s of P196.207 million recorded as Trust Liabilities 



	30)	Chapter 4 of GAM Volume I, provides for the presentation of revenue and cost in the Statement of Financial Performance (SFPer).



“Sec. 5. Presentation of Revenue in the FS. An agency shall present, in the notes of the SFPer, the total revenue, classified by MFO/PAP and by major classification of the nature of revenue attributed to the major offices/organizational unit of the agency.



Sec. 6. Presentation of Costs in the FS. An agency shall present, in the notes of the SFPer, an analysis of expenses using a classification based on the MFO/PAP and by major classification of the nature of revenue attributed to the major offices/organizational unit of the agency. The analysis of expense by MFO/PAP classifies expenses according to the program or purpose for which they were made. This method can provide more relevant information to users although allocating costs to functions may require arbitrary allocations and involves considerable judgment.”



	31)	As defined in GAM for NGAs Volume III – Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA), Trust Liabilities is the account used to recognize the receipt of amount held in trust for specific purpose. Debit this account for payment of settlement of liability. 



	32)	As of December 31, 2020, the Trust Liabilities account of JRMSU System has a balance of P196.820 million. The account increased by P40.072 million, or 26 per cent as compared to CY 2019 year-end balance. Of the total year-end balance of the said account, Trust Liabilities under TF had an aggregate amount of P196.207 million. The breakdown of the amount is shown in the following tables:

	33)	Verification of records revealed that various prior year’s collection received by the University were recorded as Trust Liabilities. It is the result of erroneous accounting treatment and charges from school fees and collection of prior year’s supposed to be treated as income of the University, but recorded as trust liabilities in the books of accounts. 



	34)	Based on the RCA, charges to this account should only cover the receipt of amounts to be held in trust for specific purposes. instead, the reported balance of the Trust Liabilities account does not reflect financial obligations/ liability of the Agency, but was used as repository of various prior year’s income generated by the University, e.g. student’s publication, review fees and other fees collected from the students prior to UniFast.



	35)	This audit issue is a reiteration from prior years. However, management yet to effect the necessary adjusting entries to correct the recording of the Trust Liabilities account.



	36)	We recognized the effort of Management to reconcileof the  accounts, but we wish to point out that inaction  on the undocumented trust liabilities could further result in difficulty of retrieval of required documents, locate claimants and extraction of information/history of transactions.



Non-recognition in the books the Expenses incurred in CY 2020 and prior year/s amounting to P1.093 million



	37)	Verification of CY 2020 financial transactions of Dipolog Campus showed that the it has unrecorded payables amounting to P1.093 million at year-end, as presented in the table below:

	38)	In the course of our audit, we noted that several expenses were not recorded in the year they were incurred. The bookkeeper recorded the payables at the time the amounts were disbursed and charged to Accumulated Surplus/ Deficit account. The practice of non-recognition of the appropriate payable/ liability at the end of the year resulted in the understatement of liabilities and expense/asset account.

Recommendations 



	39)	We recommended and Management agreed to: 



a)	Revert payables aged more than two years without valid claims;



b)	Comply with the correct accounting treatment for payables and book-up valid and legal claims in the books, for which goods/services have been delivered/ rendered, duly approved by head of office and supported with complete documentation; 

 

c)	Maintain and update regularly the SLs with complete details on the account;

 

d)	Effect the necessary adjusting entries pertaining to the Trust Liability account to reflect accurate balance for fair presentation in the FS;



e)	Identify the cause/s of the negative credit balances of the Liabilities account and make the necessary adjustments in the books of the JRMSU System; and



f)	Maintain SLs and Schedules of the Liabilities account for proper recording and monitoring of accounts;



Management Comments



	40)	Management commented that the Accounting Unit is in the process of reconciling these items to effect the necessary adjustments to reflect accurate balances. Additionally, Management issued a memorandum to the concerned personnel to closely monitor and make regular reconciliation of these records.



	41)	Management commented that they already instructed the Accounting Unit to address the concerns and comply with the recommendations. The Accounting Unit is now looking into its records to reconcile the erroneous entries and make necessary adjustments for the liability accounts.





COMPLIANCE AUDIT



Lapsed Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) amounting to P68.709 million



8)	The delay and non-implementation of various programs and projects resulted in under spending amounting to P59.267 million, lapsed NCA in the amount of P68.709 million and unutilized TF in the amount of P125.287 million for CY 2020, thereby affecting the delivery of the expected benefits and operational efficiency of the University.



	1)	Section 60 of General Appropriations Act (GAA) of 2020 provides the following: 



Cash Budgeting System. All appropriations authorized in this Act, including budgetary support to GOCCs, shall be available for release and disbursement for the purpose specified, and under the same general and special provisions applicable thereto, until December 31, 2020 xxx. 



After the end of validity period, all unreleased appropriations shall lapse, while unexpended or undisbursed funds shall revert to the unappropriated surplus of the GF in accordance with Section 28, Chapter 4, Book VI of E.O. No. 292 and shall not thereafter be available for expenditure except by subsequent legislative enactment. Departments, bureaus and offices of the National Government, including constitutional offices enjoying fiscal autonomy, SUCs and GOCCs, shall strictly observe the validity of appropriations and the reversion of funds.



For CY 2020, the appropriations for infrastructure capital outlays, including those subsidy releases to GOCCs for infrastructure projects, shall be valid for obligation until December 31, 2021, while the completion of construction, inspection, and payment shall be made not later than December 31, 2021. On the other hand, appropriations for MOOE and other capital outlays item shall likewise be valid for obligation until December 31, 2020, while the delivery, inspection and payment shall be made not later than June 30, 2021.”  Xxx



Under spending of P59.267 million



	2)	Review of the Budget Execution Document No.3 (BED No. 3) of the Monthly Cash Disbursement Program (MCDP) showed that JRMSU System had a total Disbursement Program for CY 2020 of P456.958 million wherein the actual disbursement is P397.691 million, resulting in under spending of P59.267 million.



Lapsed NCA of P68.709 million



	3)	Verification of the actual cash utilization showed that the University received total NCAs of P432.243 million for CY 2020 for the payment of salaries, personnel benefits, operating expenses and programs/projects. Of the total NCA, P68.709 million, or 16 per cent had lapsed and was reverted to the National Treasury.



Unutilized TF of P125.287 million



	4)	Based on the Statement of Budget Utilization and Disbursement by Objects of Expenditures (FAR 2-A), the University did not maximize the utilization of its STF budget in CY 2020 to enhance the physical facilities of the University and increase services to the students and faculty members. Out of the approved budget of P297.108 million, only P171.821 million, or 58 per cent were obligated during the year. The amount of P125.287 million, or 42 per cent of the entire budget remained unobligated at the end of the year.



	5)	Management informed that the non-utilization of the above funds was due to the delay in the implementation and execution of identified programs, projects and activities (PPAs), specifically in the aspect of the procurement process wherein all procurement passes through the Board of Regents of the University.



	6)	According to Management, no award of contract as a result of early bidding process will be executed without the approval of the Board of Regents, and that all contracts in connection with the hiring of Temporary Instructors charged to GAA are also covered by Board approval. Thus, implementation and completion of projects were delayed in the different stages of operations such as procurement, approval, award and recruitment.



	7)	The reversions of excess cash are reflective of the Management’s ability to project and prepare a more realistic MCDP, which was the basis of the comprehensive release of NCAs by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), and to implement projects and activities in accordance with the disbursement forecast reflected in the MCDP. It reflects Management’s inability to maximize the use of its authorized cash allocations/ funds, and to provide the University the optimum services it intended/expected to deliver to its clients.



Recommendations



	8)	We recommended and Management agreed to maximize the utilization of NCAs received and Special TF by:



a)	Facilitating the timely implementation and close monitoring of agency programs and projects, and see to it that the related disbursements adhere with the MCDP to avoid lapsing of cash allocations and ensure the realization of the benefits that can be derived therefrom; and



b)	Considering the grant of continuing authority to the University President to execute and enter into contracts with authority limits coming from the Board of Regents of the University, to address delay and to facilitate operational efficiency.





Absence of Guidelines for Incurred Mobile Expenses or Established Limits or Controls  



9)	Mobile expenses in the amount of P0.704 million as of December 31, 2020 were incurred without guidelines or established limits or controls in their use, which is not in accordance with Section 5.1 paragraph 5.0 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012.



	1)	Section 5.1 paragraph 5.0 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 provides as follows: “The term “excessive expenditures’ signifies unreasonable expense or expenses incurred in immoderate quantity and exorbitant price. It also includes expenses which exceed what is usual or proper, as well as expenses which are unreasonably high and beyond just measure or amount. They also include expenses in excess of reasonable limits.”



	2)	In our verification and review of Telephone Expenses – Mobile account as of December 31, 2020, we noted that charges to this account are for regular mobile phones issued to Officers and Employees.  



	3)	We further noted that the University does not have internal guidelines approved by the governing board as to the amount of entitlement of its officers and employees   to  mobile expenses.  The amount of plan availed by the official varied. There were officials who were even granted two mobile plans (smart and globe). 



	4)	The absence of policies and guidelines through a board resolution defining the amount of mobile expenses and determination of the officers and employees allowed to have regular mobile plan may be subject to abuse and is not aligned with the government’s observance of austerity measures, which may ultimately  result in  excessive  expenditure  of government funds.



	5)	In response to our query, Management informed that there are no existing policies and guidelines set limiting mobile expenses allowed per month, and the parameters as to the officers and employees of the campus who are allowed to have regular mobile plan.



Recommendations



	6)	We recommended and Management agreed to: 



a)	Exercise prudence and judicious incurrence of mobile expenses to avoid excessive and extravagant disbursement of government funds; and 



b)	Institute stricter policies and guidelines through a board resolution by setting – up maximum mobile expenses allowed per month with due consideration of the actual needs of the officers or employees concerned.





	Non-compliance with IPSAS and GAM for NGAs in the Presentation of Notes to FS (NFS)



10)	Non-disclosure in the NFS as of December 31, 2020 of (a) Reconciliations for Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts (SCBAA) and basis adopted in the approved budget; (b) Relevant information pertaining to the Biological Asset account with an ending balance of P46.945 million for CY 2020; (c) Revenue and expense of the University classified by Major Final Output (MFO)/ Program, Activity and Project (PAP) and by major classification of the nature of revenue attributed to the major offices/organizational unit and analysis of expenses which classifies according to program or purpose for which they are made; and (d) Details of the Prior Period Adjustments /Unrecorded Income and Expenses amounting to P16.919 million in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets and Equity (SCNA/E) for CY 2020.



Failure to disclose reconciliations for SCBAA and basis adopted in the approved budget



	1)	Paragraph 39, IPSAS 24 provides that “An entity shall explain in notes to the FSs the budgetary basis and classification basis adopted in the approved budget.”



	2)	Paragraph 24(b), IPSAS 1 provides that the NFS shall contain “Disclosure that the budgeted amounts have not been exceeded. If any budgeted amounts or appropriations have been exceeded or expenses incurred without appropriation/ allotment, then details shall be disclosed.”



	3)	Paragraph 48, IPSAS 24 & Section 28, Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs Volume I provides that “Differences between the actual amounts identified consistent with the comparable basis, and the actual amounts recognized in the FS, can usefully be classified into the following:

a)	Basis differences, which occur when the approved budget is prepared on a basis other than the accounting basis. For example, where the budget is prepared on the cash basis or modified cash basis and the FS are prepared on the accrual basis;



b)	Timing differences, which occur when the budget period differs from the reporting period reflected in the FS; and



c)	Entity differences, which occur when the budget omits programs or entities that are part of the entity for which the FS are prepared.



There may also be differences in formats and classification schemes adopted for presentation of FS and the budget.

  Distinction between mature and immature biological assets



	5)	These distinctions provide information that may be helpful in assessing the timing of future cash flows and service potential. An entity discloses the basis for making any such distinctions; (Par. 42, IPSAS 27)

a)		Xxx Additional disclosures for biological assets where fair value cannot be measured reliably:

	 

	Xxx

	

			1)		If, during the current period, an entity measures biological assets at their cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, an entity shall disclose any gain or loss recognized on disposal of such biological assets and the reconciliation shall disclose amounts related to such biological assets separately. In addition, the reconciliation shall include the following amounts included in surplus or deficit related to those biological assets: (Par. 53, IPSAS 27) (i) impairment losses; (ii) reversals of impairment losses; and (iii) depreciation;

			2)		If the fair value of biological assets previously measured at their cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses becomes reliably measurable during the current period, an entity shall disclose for those biological assets: (i) a description of the biological assets; (ii) an explanation of why fair value has become reliably measurable; and (iii) the effect of the change. (Par. 54, IPSAS 27)	

	

	6)	The disclosure made in Note 10 of the NFS for Biological Assets were presented per fund only, as follows:

	7)		Review of the NFS revealed that there were no disclosures made for biological assets as prescribed by the Standard. The initial and subsequent recognition of Biological Assets were made using cost less accumulated depreciation, with no additional disclosure as prescribed by the Standard when fair value cannot be measured reliably.

	

	Non-classification of Revenue and Expense by MFO/PAP and by major classification of the nature of revenue in the NFS 

	

	8)	Section 5, Chapter 4 of GAM for NGAs provides “An agency shall present, in the notes of the SFPer the total revenue, classified by MFO/PAP and by major classification of the nature of revenue attributed to the major offices/organizational unit of the agency.”

	

	9)		Section 6, Chapter 4 of the same Manual provides that “An agency shall present, in the notes of the SFPer, an analysis of expenses using a classification based on the MFO/PAP and by major classification of the nature of revenue attributed to the major offices/organizational unit of the agency. The analysis of expense by MFO/PAP classifies expenses according to the program or purpose for which they were made. Xxx”

	

	10)		Review of the NFS of the University showed that revenue (Note 14) and expense (Notes 15 and 16) were presented per fund in the same way it was presented in the Detailed SFPer in contravention to what is prescribed by the GAM. Thus, additional information that is not presented elsewhere in the FS but is relevant to an understanding was not further disclosed in the NFS.  

	

	11)		The non-disclosure of such relevant information prevents users of the FS more relevant information needed in analyzing the statements and understanding the contents included in the FS.

	

	Inappropriate presentation of Prior Period Adjustments/Unrecorded Income and Expenses amounting to P16,919 million in the SCNA/E for CY 2020 

	

	12)		Paragraph 54 of IPSAS 3 requires that “an entity shall disclose the (a) the nature of the prior period error; (b) for each prior period presented, to the extent practicable, the amount of the correction for each financial statement line item affected; and (c) the amount of the correction at the beginning of the earliest prior period presented.”



	13)	Review of the Combined SCNA/E for the year ended December 31, 2020 disclosed that prior period adjustments aggregating P16.919 million in CY 2020, which pertained to adjustments in Accumulated Surplus were still directly presented in the Consolidated SCNA/E without restating the affected accounts in which the errors occurred and no disclosures provided in Note 5 of NFS.



	14)	Moreover, the Audit Team could not validate the accuracy of the adjustments due to lack of appropriate supporting documents.



	15)	Examination of the records showed that there was no proper analysis on the prior period adjustments, which is an indication that rendering reliable accounting reports is not given an utmost priority. Hence, the reliability of the adjustments could not be established, thereby affecting the fairness of its presentation in the SCNA/E and in the overall FS.



Recommendations 



	16)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	Ensure that significant and required disclosures in the presentation of reconciliation on the material differences of FS are included on the NFS to give clearer information to the reader or user of such report, and comply with the prescribed Standards in the recognition, measurement and disclosures for Biological Assets;



b)	Ensure that disclosures pertaining to revenue and expenses are presented in the NFS classified by MFO/ PAP and by major classification per nature of revenue and expenses as prescribed by the Standard; and



c)	Comply with IPSAS 3 in presenting correction of prior period errors by restating the comparative amounts for the period(s) presented in which errors occurred and provide adequate disclosure in the NFS; and submit list/schedules showing the details of the prior period adjustments supported with complete/appropriate documentation.



	Delayed Submission of Financial Reports

	

11)		Delayed or non-submission of official receipts (ORs), DVs, BRSs, trial balances (TBs), FS and supporting schedules ranging from 74 to 493 days precluded the prompt audit of accounts and financial transactions, early detection and correction of errors/deficiencies and timely reporting of the audit results to  Management which is not in accordance with the provisions of Sections 60 (c), Chapter 19, and Section 7, Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, Section 7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 and Section 41 of PD 1445.

	

	1)		Section 60 (c), Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs on the submission of reports provides that all NGAs shall prepare and submit the following FS and schedules within the prescribed deadline as presented in the Table:

	

	Table 57 – FS and Schedules with the Prescribed Deadline

	2)		Sections 7, Chapter 21, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs on Bank Reconciliation states that the Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within 20 days after receipt of the monthly bank statement (BS) the original to the COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents and JEVs).

	

	3)		Section 7.2.1(a) of COA Circular No. 2009-006 states that “The reports and supporting documents submitted by accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month.”

	

	4)		Section 41 of PD 1445 requires the Chief Accountant or the official in- charge of keeping of the accounts of a government agency the submission to the COA of year-end TBs and such other supporting subsidiary statements not later than the 14th day of February.

	

	5)		Further, the National Guidelines on Internal Control Systems, as circularized in DBM Circular Letter No. 2008-8 dated October 23, 2008, specifically listing reconciliation of financial and non-financial data among the most common control policies and procedures that are part of the coordinated measures and procedures that every office should have. Operating procedures of every office require that the cash records of the Accounting and Cash units should be regularly reconciled. Moreover, the records of the depository banks pertaining to the cash accounts of the agency should be reconciled with the records of the Accounting and Cash units. These processes will help detect errors or fraud either by the bank, the Accounting unit or the Cash unit”.

	

	6)		An evaluation of the monitoring results on the submission of financial reports for CY 2020 transactions of JRMSU Main Campus showed that delays were incurred in the submission of reports ranging from 13 to 493 days, while all BRS for the TF of JRMSU Main Campus have not yet submitted. 

	

	7)		Review and verification of DVs, TBs, FS, and other reports covering the period January to December 2020 disclosed the  following:

	

	Delayed submission of RCDs and ORs

	

	8)		The agency’s submission of RCDs and ORs covering the period from January to December 2020 were 74 to 232 days delayed from the due date. The RCDs and its supporting duplicate copies of ORs and validated copies of deposit slips were made on a monthly basis instead of daily, or at the close of the business day. 

	

	9)		Consequently, the Accounting Unit records the collection and deposit in bulk representing the transaction of the whole month instead of on a daily basis. Due to the delayed submission, the Collecting Officer’s Cash Receipt’s Records (CRRs) cannot be regularly reconciled with the Accounting Unit’s ledgers, hence possible errors in recording cannot be immediately detected and remedial action could not be executed by the Management. However, the Cashier immediately submits the RCDs to COA Office after the end of the month while separate RCDs are submitted to the Accounting Unit for recording. The delay incurred in the submission of RCDs and ORs to the Audit Team ranges from 74 to 232 days. Details showed as follows:

	10)	Based on our query, the Collecting Officer (CO) acknowledged the deficiency and confirmed that the reports are submitted in bulk. This has been the practice of the Office since its operation, without being aware of the deviation from the standards. The CO informed that due to the volume of transactions caused by the monthly submission, review on the accuracy of the encoded amounts and deposits was not observed, and the Accounting Unit will just rely on the printed copy of the RCD without validating the same.



Delayed submission of DVs 



	11)	The agency’s submission of DVs covering the period from January to December 2020 were 158 to 408 days delayed from the due date as tabulated below:

	12)	Due to the current situation of the pandemic where personnel in the Accounting Unit were not able to maximize the time to meet the deadline, the reports were not timely acted upon. Most personnel who were in-charge with the preparation of the DVs were quarantined and several backlogs were left. The Office was closed several times and work from home arrangement does not permit the employees to work efficiently on their assigned tasks.



	13)	Delayed submission of the required financial reports and source documents precluded the timely conduct of audit and consequently, prevented the early detection and correction of errors and deficiencies as well as the timely reporting of the audit results to Management.



Delayed submission of BRS



	14)	ALL BRS for TF and IGP were not submitted as of June 17, 2021 with a delay ranging from 158 days to 493, while the BRS for the GF were not submitted on time ranging from 158 to 423 days, thus no timely recording of reconciling items.

	15)	The availability of the BSs contributed to the delay in the preparation of BRS. However, since bank snapshots are readily available and can be generated after month-end, these could have served the same purpose as that of a BS. Online facilities (weAccess) could have also been availed by Management as the alternative sources of reference. 



	16)	Upon inquiry, the Cashier acknowledged that the bank snapshots are already accessible upon request with the bank. The Accountant mentioned that aside from the absence of necessary documents needed to prepare the BRS, the other cause of the delay is the voluminous transactions and lack of manpower, hence, monthly financial reports (TBs, GLs, etc.) were completed late. Consequently, since the BRS can only be prepared when the TBs and GLs are already available, the preparation of the same were likewise affected.

	17)	Prompt submission of monthly TBs and interim/quarterly FS has not been observed. For the months of January to December, the submission for GF and IGP was delayed for 94 to 483 days. For the STF, the TBs and FS remain unsubmitted, as follows:

**No report submitted (No. of days delayed counted as of June 17, 2021)



	18)	We recognized the effort of Management in the submission of reports but the Audit Team emphasizes that belated or non-submission of financial reports as they fall due defeats the purpose of achieving the desired result in timely reporting for maximum usefulness of reports. This also affects the timely audit of the accounts/ receipts/disbursements and prompt correction of deficiencies, if any. Likewise, incomplete submission of supporting documents for the payment of various transactions may affect the propriety, validity and legality of the claims paid.



	19)	Accurate and timely bank reconciliations reduce the risk of undetected errors on the agency and/or bank records. Without effective accounting control, GL accounts may be inaccurate or incomplete, funds may not be properly accounted for, and cash balances may not be reliable. Monthly bank reconciliation is an important internal control mechanism for cash management.



	20)	The above noted deficiencies have been recurring and in fact, the AARs for CYs 2018 and 2019 contained the same audit observations for which the corresponding audit recommendations had remained partially implemented by Management.



Recommendations



	21)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	Enhance the monitoring controls on the submission by the AOs and the Accounting Unit; 

 

b)	Submit immediately the lacking DVs complete with relevant supporting documents and observe the deadline set for the submission of TBs and other financial reports; and



c)	Determine the root cause of delay and gap in compliance with the requirements of pertinent COA rules and regulations on timeliness regarding the submission of required reports to maximize the usefulness and prompt correction of deficiencies.

		

Management Comments



Tampilisan Campus



	22)		According to Management, one of the reasons for the delayed submission of reports is that there was a change of personnel. The current Accountant just assumed office and was still tracing records for the unintentional errors made causing the non-reconciliation of reports.



	23)	Moreover, the Management already issued a memorandum to the concerned Officials to implement the timely submission of reports.



Siocon Campus



	24)	Management agreed to enhance monitoring control mechanism on the timeliness on the submission of accounting reports as required by COA rules and regulations to maximize usefulness and prompt correction of deficiencies.





Non-compliance of the Appropriate Project Signboards



12)	Infrastructure and non-infrastructure projects implemented did not fully comply with the posting requirement of appropriate project signboards and/or public notices under COA Circular No. 2013-004, hence, notification, announcement and/or publicity to inform the public were not attained.

	1)	COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 2013 with a Subject: Information and Publicity on Programs/Projects/Activities (PPA) of Government Agencies provides that:



Paragraph 1.1 of the above cited circular provides that:



“Subject to reasonable conditions prescribed by law, the State adopts and implements a policy of full disclosure of all transactions involving public interest and recognizes the right of the people to information on matters of public concern.”



	2)	Moreover, Paragraph 2.2, 2.2.1 & 2.2.3 of the said Circular provides that:



“Notification to the public and other forms of announcement and/or publicity for or otherwise relating to the PPA shall be made at the least possible cost, taking into account that the nature of and purposes of such notification, announcement and/or publicity, is to inform the public of the essential features/elements of PPA. Accordingly:



All government agencies, or implementing unit, office or division as the case may be, shall notify the public of their PPA through the posting of relevant information detailed in Item 2.1 above on signboards, blackboards, whiteboards, posters, tarpaulins, streamers, electronic boards or similar materials (collectively, “Signboards”) not exceeding  3 feet by 2 feet, in conspicuous places within the agency premises, and in the venue where the PPA is located or carries out.  This requirement applies to all government PPAs, regardless of amount of source of funds.



“For infrastructure projects, a tarpaulin signboard must be suitable framed for outdoor display at the project location, and shall be posted  as soon  as the award has been made.  The design and format of the tarpaulin, as shown in Annex” A”, shall have the following specifications:

			Tarpaulin, white, 8ft x 8 ft

			Resolution: 70 dpi

			Font: Helvetica

           		Font Size: Main Information – 3”

			Sub-Information – 1”

			Font Color: Black



	3)	In relation, thereto, Paragraph 3.1 and 3.2 of the same Circular provides that:



“The Head of Agency shall inform its SA and ATL within ten (10) days after the awards of the infrastructure project or before the start of the program/activity that the appropriate project signboards and/or public notices are already posted, and the SA and ATL shall validate the same.

Xxx



Based on the data sourced from the monthly monitoring report prepared by the agency and verified by the Technical Audit Specialist of this Commission, the Project Status (in Annex "A") should be maintained as current as possible and updated, using the following schedule: Xxx”



	4)	The above provisions aim to properly inform the public of PPAs undertaken by JRMSU System by the use of billboards or tarpaulins as well as posting to the website of the University.



Non-posting of billboards of infrastructure projects



	5)	Inspection by the Audit Team revealed that JRMSU – Main and its Campuses did not fully comply as to the posting of projects signboards for infrastructure projects as required.



	6)	We also noted that on-going infrastructure projects as well as the two terminated Outome-Based Education (OBE) and Engineering Building infrastructure projects bears no tarpaulin/ signboard in a suitable framed for outdoor display at the project location.



Non-posting of billboards of non-infrastructure PPA’s



	7)	Section 2.2.4 of COA Circular No. 2016-003 dated August 16, 2016 provides that for non-infrastructure PPAs, such as but not limited to medical and dental missions; distribution of relief goods and services; feeding programs; sports, athletic, and cultural/social events; employment and livelihood fairs and training; workshops and seminars; office anniversary celebrations, a tarpaulin signboard similar to Item 2.2.3 above may be displayed at the project site, but not to exceed 3 feet by 4 feet. Project Details may be omitted for PPA not exceeding 5 days; however, the start and end dates must be specified.



	8)	We also reviewed the compliance on the publication requirements as contained in the above-stated COA Circular for non-infrastructure PPA’s implemented by the Main Campus, and we also noted that there was no compliance with the tarpaulin signboard displayed at the project site.



	9)	In response to our query, Management informed that they will implement the publication requirements in their subsequent PPAs both infrastructure and non – infrastructure PPAs.



	10)	Reported PPAs should be complete in all information to guide the users thereof to make informed decisions. Inaccurate information on the projects being implemented and to be implemented resulted in the difficulty of validation on the status and/or information on the reported PPAs being implemented by the University System.



Recommendations



	11)	We recommended and Management agreed that:



a)	Coordination be established between the Bids and Awards Committee, Project Engineer, Budget Unit and Administrative Unit regarding the preparation of report on the PPAs implemented and to be implemented by the Campus; 



b)	Submission be made at the beginning of the year, as well as timely updating of PPA reports should be done if there are corrections, revisions or changes to the projects to be implemented for validation and monitoring; and



c)	Compliance with the publication requirements as to the display of project signboards be implemented both infrastructure and non – infrastructure PPA’s of the Main Campus.





Delay in the Completion of Infrastructure Projects



13)	Timelines in the implementation of infrastructure projects amounting to P71.186 million were not complied with resulting in the delay of  their  completion.



	1)	Rule II-Procurement Planning of RA 9184 provides that: All procurement shall be within the approved budget of the Procuring Entity and should be meticulously and judiciously planned by the Procuring Entity.



	2)	Section 2 of PD 1445 provides for the efficient and effective disposition of government resources: Declaration of Policy. It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government.



	3)	The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned. 



	4)	Review of the Consolidated Quarterly Reports on Government PPAs as of  December 31, 2020, showed that four infrastructure projects of JRMSU System with a contract amount of P71.186 million were not completed on the target completion date as of December 31, 2020 as presented in the table below:

	5)		Based on Office records, the Construction of 4-Storey ITE Building in the Main Campus has a 75 per cent accomplishment despite the execution of a Joint Affidavit of Undertaking dated June 25, 2019. Paragraph 4 of the said Undertaking provides that the Contractor undertakes to finish the construction of the ITE Building and to turn-over the same to JRMSU on or before November 30, 2019.

	

	6)		On December 11, 2019 a catch up plan was prepared but schedules stipulated were not properly performed based on the assessment of the Contract Administrator assigned on the project. Another catch up plan received by the Management on June 3, 2020, which was still not duly performed per letter of the Contract Administrator dated August 10, 2020 addressed to the Contractor. Management informed that despite the delay, the Contractor is committed to complete the project.

	

	7)		In the Katipunan Campus, the Audit Team noted that the original completion date is December 31, 2018 based on 210 calendar days as embodied in the contract. Subsequently, the completion date was revised to March 31, 2019 as indicated in the Accomplishment Report.  Still the project was not completed as of December 31, 2020. Management informed that the project is almost complete and they will communicate with the contractor to attain 100 per cent completion.

	

	8)		It is settled that the primary consideration of the government for entering into contracts is to ensure the timely completion of the infrastructure projects so that improvement in facilities can be best attained and experienced at the most opportune time.

	

	9)		The grant of various extensions due to variation orders and other reasons indicates poor planning and unreliable engineering design and this can entail budgetary problems. The funds allotted and obligated for the above – mentioned projects were reverted to the BTr and beneficiaries were deprived of the beneficial use of the said projects.

	

	Recommendations 

	

	10)		We recommended and Management agreed to:

a)		Enhance its monitoring control and supervision in the implementation of future infrastructure projects; 

	

b)		Institute the necessary remedies provided under the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9184 such as but not limited to imposition of liquidated damages for delayed project completion, as warranted; and

	

c)		Minimize delay in project implementation by thoroughly reviewing and evaluating the Program of Work to ensure that projects designs and estimates are properly prepared and that all phases of the project are covered to minimize variation orders and time extensions. 

	

	

Unliquidated Cash Advances (CAs) 



14)		CAs in the amount of P43.610 million remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020 contrary to the pertinent provision of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, resulting in the accumulation of the balance of Advances for Payroll and Advances to Officers and Employees accounts.

	

	1)		The Audit Team verified the grant of CAs and it was observed that out of the reported balance, 98.41 per cent or P43.610 million was not liquidated within the prescribed period. Details are as follows:

	2)	Of this amount, 98.11 per cent or P42.784 million pertains to Advances for Payroll that remained unliquidated for more than two months as of December 31, 2020. It is emphasized that CAs for salaries and wages shall be liquidated within five days after each 15 day/end of the month pay period and when a CA is no longer needed or has not been used for a period of two months, it must be returned to or refunded.



	3)	We also verified the fidelity bond of the AO of the Main Campus and it was noted that the approved maximum cash accountability is P5 million, hence, the average CAs exceeded the approved cash bond, thus risk of loss will not be covered by the corresponding fidelity bond.



	4)	The Audit Team emphasized that the grant and liquidation of CAs should be properly monitored and controlled such that advances should not be allowed when previous CAs were not liquidated.



	5)	The Accountant of the Main Campus commented that the AOs were consistently reminded verbally of their obligation to liquidate their CAs, however, as of to date liquidation was not made, which resulted to the accumulation of outstanding CAs as of December 31, 2020.



	6)	As for the Tampilisan Campus, the Accountant explained that the AO who had the unliquidated CA in the amount of P144,380.00 was a former employee of the campus who is already dead, thus collection is uncertain.



Recommendation



	7)	We recommended and Management agreed to require the immediate liquidation/settlement by the concerned officials/employees and issue demand letters to enforce collection of the CAs and comply with Section 89 of PD 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 on the granting, utilization and liquidation of CAs.











	 

	OTHER MANDATORY AUDIT AREAS

	

	COMPLIANCE WITH RA 9003 OTHERWISE KNOWN AS SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT ACT OF 2000

	

15)	Lack of monitoring mechanism on the implementation of the Solid Waste Management Plan (SWMP) resulted in the non-implementation or gap in implementation of the requirements of RA 9003, or the Solid Waste Management (SWM) Act of 2000.



	1)	Section 10 of the RA 9003, otherwise known as the SWM Act of 2000 dated July 24, 2000 provides the following:



“Pursuant to the relevant provisions of RA 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code, the LGUs shall be primarily responsible for the implementation and enforcement of the provisions of this Act within their respective jurisdictions.



Segregation and collection of solid waste shall be conducted at the barangay level specifically for biodegradable, compostable and reusable wastes: Provided that the collection of non-recyclable materials and special wastes shall be the responsibility of the municipality or city.”



Audit Team’s validation – Main Campus



	2)	JRMSU Main Campus collects solid waste on trash bins and directly puts it to a collection point inside the campus to be collected by the city sanitation personnel on garbage truck every Tuesday. 



	3)	Observation and inspection by the Audit Team disclosed that no monitoring mechanism in the continuing implementation in the management of waste be it biodegradable or non-biodegradable.



	4)	We noted gaps in monitoring which hamper its effective and efficient implementation of the program, like non-segregation at source. We also noted that only few trash bins were available with no markings or label as to biodegradable, non – biodegradable and recyclable, and the Material Recovery Facility (MRF) was not properly managed.

Audit Team’s validation – Dipolog Campus



	5)	The Audit Team acknowledged the efforts of the Campus Officials in complying and implementing RA 9003 and its SWMP, but we noted that no monitoring mechanism in the continuing implementation in the management of waste be it biodegradable or non-biodegradable.



	6)	We noted gaps in monitoring which hampers its effective and efficient implementation like non-segregation at source. Only few trash bins were available and the MRF was not properly managed.  



	7)	The above observation and condition is indicative of lack of coordination among the different offices of the University on SWM.  We emphasize that lack of monitoring mechanism as to continuing implementation of SWM would defeat the purpose of RA 9003.



	8)	Waste Management is a national issue and is no doubt among the primary concern of all. It consists of five options: source reduction, incineration, landfill, recycling and composting.  These are the most commonly practiced approaches. The project is designed to receive, sort, process, and store compostable and recyclable material efficiently and in an environmentally sound manner.



	9)	In the case of the University, trash should be properly segregated and regularly collected with proper maintenance of the Campus MRF. The volume of waste considerably increased with the growing population/students of the Campus.  The information campaign of segregating trash at source and the expected cooperation from the University constituents were not attained.  Moreover, the objectives of establishing the MRF were not achieved.



	10)	The situation above-mentioned showed that the University has not fully implemented the strategies formulated to address the proper waste management and disposal and has not fully complied with the provisions of RA 9003.

Recommendations



	11)	We recommended that the Campus enhance its compliance with RA 9003 by instituting monitoring mechanism to: 

a)	Implement waste segregation at source to facilitate the sanitary and efficient waste handling, collection and disposal; and 



b)	Provide waste segregation and storage containers with appropriate labels and proper maintenance of the MRF of the Campus.





COMPLIANCE WITH RA 9184, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT REFORM ACT



16)	Dates of delivery by Suppliers and acceptance by Management were not indicated in the Inspection and Acceptance Reports (IARs) thus, imposition of liquidated damages in cases of delays in the delivery of procurement of goods could not be imposed contrary to Section 68 of the Revised IRR of RA 9184.



	1)	The Revised IRR of RA 9184 updated as of 31 March 2021, specifically Section 68 requires that:



“All contracts executed in accordance with the Act and this IRR shall contain a provision on liquidated damages which shall be payable by the contractor in case of breach thereof. For the procurement of Goods, Infrastructure Projects and Consulting Services, the amount of the liquidated damages shall be at least equal to one-tenth of one percent (0.001) of the cost of the unperformed portion for every day of delay. Once the cumulative amount of liquidated damages reaches ten percent (10%) of the amount of the contract, the Procuring Entity may rescind or terminate the contract, without prejudice to other courses of action and remedies available under the circumstances.



	2)	As amended by Government Procurement Policy Board  (GPPB) Resolution No. 02-2020, dated 27 February 2020



“When the supplier fails to satisfactorily deliver goods under the contract within the specified delivery schedule, inclusive of duly granted time extensions, if any, the supplier shall be liable for damages for the delay and shall pay the procuring entity liquidated damages, not by way of penalty, an amount equal to one-tenth (1/10) of one percent (1%) of the cost of the delayed goods scheduled for delivery for every day of delay until such goods are finally delivered and accepted by the procuring entity concerned. The procuring entity need not prove that it has incurred actual damages to be entitled to liquidated damages. Such amount shall be deducted from any money due or which may become due to the supplier, or collected from any securities or warranties posted by the supplier, whichever is convenient to the procuring entity concerned. In case the total sum of liquidated damages reaches ten percent (10%) of the total contract price, the procuring entity concerned may rescind the contract and impose appropriate sanctions over and above the liquidated damages to be paid.”



	3)		The General Provisions of RA 11465, GAA for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, provides the following guidelines:



“Section 17. Use of Government Funds. Government Funds shall be utilized in accordance with the appropriations authorized for the purpose and comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations, such as purchase of goods, infrastructure projects and consulting services xxx.



Section 18. Strict adherence to Procurement Laws, Rules and Regulations. All agencies of the government shall strictly adhere to the provisions of RA 9184, its IRR and GPPB guidelines in the procurement of goods, infrastructure projects and consulting services.”

	4)	The Audit Team reviewed various DVs with an amount of more than P100,000.00 and we noted that deliveries of goods procured did not have the necessary information to determine if the goods were delivered on time since no actual date of delivery was indicated  in the IAR.  The details are shown in the Table below.

	5)	Based on the Table presented, there are late deliveries with no liquidated damages imposed by Management, if the date of actual inspection and acceptance by the inspectorate team and Property Officer is to be considered as the actual date of delivery. 



	6)	The Audit Team emphasized that complete information in the IAR should be indicated to reflect the actual date of delivery. Besides, the date of inspection signed by the inspection officers and the date of acceptance by the Property Officer cannot be considered as the actual date of delivery since the actual inspection and acceptance may be conducted on other dates. Under normal circumstances, the actual date of delivery should be the date of the acceptance report wherein in this case the Acceptance Report is undated. Hence, the University cannot determine the number of days delayed which is the basis of the imposition of liquidated damages.

	7)	Further examination showed that a number of POs of the Dipolog Campus did not indicate the date of delivery, signature over printed name of supplier (under conforme) and date (under Conforme) which are required under Appendix 61 of GAM to support purchase of property, supplies and materials, as presented in the table:

	13)	Further review of the sample procurement of good, supplies and equipment, we noted that there is a gap between the actual date of inspection and the date of the IAR. Hence, the actual inspection was not conducted on the actual delivery on the following procurement as detailed in the table below:

	16)	The Bookkeeper-designate informed that her lack of experience and knowledge in the processing of DVs with supposed liquidated damages was the reason for the non-collection of the same.



	17)	We recognized the explanation of Management, but we emphasized that delayed deliveries of procured goods will hinder the efficient implementation or usage of the different PPAs by its intended stakeholders which may affect the effectiveness of the delivery of the two major outputs of the University.



Recommendations



	18)	We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	Ensure that complete information are indicated in the IAR  and other supporting procurement documents before approval, to determine and impose liquidated damages in case of delay in the delivery of procured goods and services; and



b)	 Impose the collection of the liquidated damages in cases of suppliers’ delayed performance in the delivery of procured goods and services.

	

	

	Compliance with Gender and Development (GAD)



17)	JRMSU System did not maintain its own GAD Database including Sex-Disaggregated Data (SDD) in identifying Gender Issues and formulating its GAD Plans, Programs and Budget which is not in conformity with Section 36(c) of RA 9710 and Section 37.A.1.a of the IRR of the same Act, while the GAD Program implementation for CY 2020 disclosed deficiencies, such as: a) delay in the submission of GPB and Accomplishment Report (AR);  b) GAD Budget was not fully utilized and low utilization rate of GAD budget.



	1)	Section 36 (c) of RA 9710, or the Magna Carta for Women (MCW) provides that:



“All departments, including their attached agencies, offices, bureaus-state universities and colleges, government-owned and –controlled corporations, local LGUs, and other government instrumentalities shall develop and maintain a GAD database containing gender statistics and sex-disaggregated date that have been systematically gathered, regularly updated, and subjected to gender analysis for planning, programming, and policy formulation.”



	2)	Moreover, Section 37 A.1.a of the IRR of the same RA provides that:



“Following the conduct of a gender audit, gender analysis, and/or review of sex-disaggregated data, each agency or LGU shall develop its GAD Plans, Programs, and Budget in response to the gender gaps or issues faced by their women and men employees, as well as their clients and constituencies. Along with the Act and these Rules and Regulations, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (PPGD), the Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA), and the CEDAW, among others, shall serve as key documents to guide the identification of gender issues and the formulation of GAD Plans, Programs and Budget.”



	3)	Additionally, Section 5 or the Declaration of Policy of the same IRR states that:



“Recognizing that economic, political, and sociocultural realities affect women's current condition, the State affirms the role of women in nation building and ensures the substantive equality of women and men. It shall promote empowerment of women, pursue equal opportunities for women and men, and ensure equal access to resources and to development results and outcome. Further, the State realizes that equality of men and women entails the abolition of the unequal structures and practices that perpetuate discrimination and inequality. To realize this, the State shall endeavor to develop plans, policies, programs, measures, and mechanisms to address discrimination and inequality in the economic, political, civil, social, and cultural life of women and men.”



	4)	Lastly, Section 3.2 of Philippine Commission Women (PCW) MC No. 2011-01 defines Gender Analysis as follows:



“refers to a framework to compare the relative advantages and disadvantages faced by women and men in various spheres of life, including the family, workplace, school, community and political system. It also takes into account how class, age, race, ethnicity, culture, social and other factors interact with gender to produce discriminatory results;”



	5)	COA Circular No. 2004-001 dated March 18, 2014 requires the audited agency to submit a copy of the Annual GPB to the COA Audit Team within five working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the PCW, or their mother or central offices, as the case maybe. Likewise, a copy of the GAD AR shall be furnished to the Audit Team within five working days from the end of January of the preceding year.



	6)	Section 4.4 of the PCW- National Economic and Development Authority  (NEDA)- DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides that “the agency shall develop or integrate in its existing database GAD information to include gender statistics and sex-disaggregated data that have been systematically produced or gathered as inputs or bases for planning, budgeting, programming, and policy formulation.”



	7)	Based on the result of GAD Audit Checklist and interview with the GAD Unit Head, the Audit Team noted that the University was not able to develop and maintain GAD database containing gender statistics and SDD. Management stated that while it is included in the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB), it was not accomplished and most of the sex–disaggregated statistical data comes from different department/units of the University.



	8)	Management also informed that they did not conduct Gender Audit and no institutionalization of GAD database. Although the activities were related to GAD, these activities were not implemented as a result of Gender Analysis and the maintenance of SDD.



	9)	It must also be noted that SDD should pertain to data regarding the agency’s employees (Organization-Focused) and clients (Client-Focused). Although the data given is technically “Sex-Disaggregated”, it lacks data necessary for the identification of gender issues and ultimately the formulation of GAD Plans, Programs and Budget.



	10)	The above-mentioned provisions in the MCW and its IRR emphasize the importance of SDD in the identification of gender issues and the formulation of GAD Plans, Programs and Budget. As such, the University’s SDD should not just be a simple statistic of males and females but must include data regarding the following, among others:



1)	Families and Households

2)	Employment and Livelihood

3)	Education

4)	Health



	11)	Absence of these data in the agency’s SDD will result in unrealistic and unresponsive gender issues necessary in the formulation of GAD Plans, Programs and Budget and ultimately, in addressing discrimination and inequality in the economic, political, civil, social and cultural life of women and men.



Delay in the submission of GPB and GAD AR



	12)	Based on Office record, JRMSU Main and its Campuses were not able to submit a copy of the Annual GPB to the COA Audit Team within five working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the PCW, and a copy of the Accomplishment Report within five working days from the end of January of the preceding year.



	13)	In our query, Management informed that they will comply with the timelines on the next submission and they recognized the belated submission.



GAD Budget was not fully utilized, and Low utilization rate



	14)	Review of the office copy of the GAD AR revealed that there were identified GAD activities with available funding that were not implemented during the year. Management explained that due to the pandemic and health protocols, the Campus was not able to implement GAD activities identified.



	15)	The Audit Team also reviewed the overall accomplishment by comparing the actual cost or expenditure to total GAD approved budget and we noticed low utilization of GAD budget of the campuses, as presented in the Table below:

	16)		Management informed that low utilization of GAD budget and non–implementation of identified GAD activities is due to the on–going pandemic.

 

Recommendations



	17)	We recommended and Management agreed to improve its compliance with GAD planning, budgeting, monitoring, evaluation, reportorial requirements and GAD budget utilization to fully attain the objectives of GAD by:



a)	Collecting SDD regarding Families and Households, Employment and Livelihood, Education and Health thru sending out questionnaires to its employees and students via pen and paper questionnaires or through online surveys/questionnaires like Google Forms and Survey Monkey; 



b)	Collating the above-mentioned SDD, regularly update and maintain it at the University’s GAD database and use them in analyzing and identifying gender issues in  the formulation of GAD Plans, Programs and Budget;



c)	Monitoring the timeline for compliance in the submission of GPB and AR; and



d)	 Preparing a workable timeline in implementing the program of activities of the University to ensure that the GAD Plan’s PPAs for the year are implemented.



Management Comment



	18)	Management commented that as to GPB, the GAD Unit Head has not yet received an approved/endorsed GPB from the PCW until this date. As regards the GAD AR, the submission was extended until May 30, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the GAD Unit Head mentioned that as to the unimplemented GAD activities, the GAD Focal Point System did not recommend for the hiring of a Front Desk Officer per campus since the Guidance Office has trained faculty members who were tapped to facilitate gender-based concerns of the stakeholders in the University. Management further commented that they will work closely with the Research Office to ensure that GAD-related researches shall be conducted.





COMPLIANCE WITH TAX LAWS



18)	The University complied with the provisions of Joint Circular No. 1-2000 dated January 3, 2000 of the Department of Finance, DBM  and COA, as amended by Joint Circular No. 1-2000A dated July 31, 2001 on the guidelines on the remittances of all taxes withheld by the NGAs to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). Taxes withheld and remitted during the year is summarized below:
