EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





Introduction



The University was established on July 4, 1947 by the Dapitan Municipal Government with the late Francisco L. Bajamunde as the first principal.  It was then known as Dapitan Junior High School, offering the first two years of the general secondary curriculum.  A few years later, it became a full-grown secondary school producing its first graduates and was named Dapitan High School.  It was subsidized by the Province of Zamboanga del Norte (ZDN) and by the Dapitan Municipal Government.

	

On July 1, 1960, the College was converted into a national trade school and was named Rizal Memorial National Vocational School (RMNVS) under Republic Act (RA) No. 2436 and was placed under the supervision of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports.



The Jose Rizal Memorial State College (JRMSC) was established on June 11, 1996 by virtue of RA 8193, integrating the RMNVS of Dapitan City, the ZDN School of Arts and Trade of Dipolog City and the Siocon National Vocational School of Siocon, ZDN.  The RMNVS in Dapitan City was made the main campus of the College. The supervision of the College has been transferred to Commission of Higher Education (CHED).



The implementation of CHED Memorandum Order No. 27, integrated the Katipunan National Agricultural School (KNAS), Katipunan and ZDN Agricultural College (ZNAC), Tampilisan, both in ZDN as branches of the JRMSC, ZDN.  With the adoption of Resolution No. 120-2002 by the CHED en banc dated April 29, 2002, ZNAC was integrated with the Western Mindanao State University , Zamboanga City. But pursuant to CHED en banc Resolution No. 332-2006 dated May 30, 2006, ZNAC was reintegrated to JRMSC effective School Year 2007-2008.



On December 15, 2009, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo approved RA 9852 converting the College into a chartered state university and named as Jose Rizal Memorial State University (JRMSU). 



The mandate of the JRMSU is to offer higher professional, technical and special instructions for special purposes and promote research extension services, advanced studies and progressive leadership in education, agriculture, arts and sciences, engineering and other fields that may be relevant.  The University offers undergraduate and graduate courses in the field of education, engineering, arts and sciences and other degree courses as the Board of Trustees may deem necessary to carry out its objectives.  It also offers short-term technical or vocational courses within the area of specification to meet the needs of the nation.





Audit Objective



The objective of the audit conducted is to a) ascertain the fairness of presentation of the financial statements (FS); b) ascertain the propriety of financial transactions and compliance with prescribed rules and regulations; c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations. Performance audit was likewise conducted with the objective of informing management where improvement can be instituted in the field of revenues, expenditures and management of resources.

Independent Auditor’s Report on the FS



We rendered an adverse opinion on the fairness of presentation on the FS  of JRMSU System  for the year  ended December 31, 2020, due to misstatements  affecting various  accounts in the  FS amounting to P546.943 million, with understatement of total Assets and Equity by P207.643 million  and 402.757 million, respectively,  and overstatement of the total Liabilities by P195.114 million, and accounting deficiencies. The said misstatements and deficiencies affected Management’s assertions on the FS that all transactions and events have been fully reported (completeness), were recorded without error (accuracy), within the correct reporting period (cut-off), in the proper accounts (classification), and actually took place (occurrence) and that all account balances exist (existence). These misstatements and deficiencies have significant impact and pervasive effect on the presentation of the year end FS as detailed in Tables 1 and 2 below.

Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



1)	The delay and non-implementation of various programs and projects resulted in under spending amounting to P59.267 million, lapsed Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) in the amount of P68.709 million and unutilized TF in the amount of P125.287 million for CY 2020 thereby, affecting the delivery of the expected benefits and operational efficiency of the University.



We recommended that Management maximize the utilization of NCAs received and Special Trust Fund by: a)	Facilitating the timely implementation and close monitoring of agency programs and projects and see to it that the related disbursements adhere with the Monthly Cash Disbursement Program, to avoid lapsing of cash allocations and ensure the realization of the benefits that can be derived therefrom; and b) Considering the grant of continuing authority to the University President to execute and enter into contracts with authority limits coming from the Board of Regents of the University, to address delay and to facilitate operational efficiency.



2)	Mobile expenses in the amount of P0.704 million as of December 31, 2020 were incurred without guidelines or established limits or controls in their use which is not in accordance with Section 5.1 paragraph 5.0 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012.



We recommended that Management: a) Exercise prudence and judicious incurrence of mobile expenses to avoid excessive and extravagant disbursement of government funds; and b) Institute stricter policies and guidelines through a board resolution setting – up maximum mobile expenses allowed per month with due consideration of the actual needs of the officers or employees concerned.



3)	Non-disclosure in the Notes to FS (NFS) as of December 31, 2020 of (a) Reconciliations for Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts and basis adopted in the approved budget; (b) Relevant information pertaining to Biological Asset account with an ending balance of P46.945 million for CY 2020; (c) Revenue and expense of the University classified by Major Final Output (MFO)/ Program, Activity and Project (PAP) and by major classification of the nature of revenue attributed to the major offices/organizational unit and analysis of expenses classified according to program or purpose for which they are made; and (d) Details of the Prior Period Adjustments /Unrecorded Income and Expenses amounting to P16.919 million in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets and Equity for CY 2020.



We recommended that Management: a)	Ensure that significant and required disclosures in the presentation of reconciliation on the material differences of FSs are included on the NFS to give clearer information to the reader or user of such report, and  comply with the prescribed Standards in the recognition, measurement and disclosures for Biological Assets; b) Ensure that disclosures pertaining to details of the long-term liabilities are included in the NFS and revenue and expenses are presented in its NFS classified by MFO/ PAP and by major classification of the nature of revenue and expenses as prescribed by the Standard; and c) Comply with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 3 in presenting correction of prior period errors by restating the comparative amounts for the period(s) presented in which errors occurred and provide adequate disclosure in the NFS; and submit list/schedules showing the details of the prior period adjustments supported with complete/appropriate documentation.



4)	Timelines in the implementation of infrastructure projects amounting to P71.186 million were not complied with resulting in the delay of their completion.



We recommended that Management: a) Enhance its monitoring control and supervision in the implementation of future infrastructure projects;  b) Institute the necessary remedies provided under the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9184 such as but not limited to imposition of liquidated damages for delayed projects if warranted; and c) Minimize delay in project implementation by thoroughly reviewing and evaluating the Program of Work to ensure that projects designs and estimates are properly prepared and that all phases of the project are covered to minimize variation orders and time extensions.

 

5)	Cash advances in the amount of P43.610 million remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020 contrary to the pertinent provision of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, resulting to the accumulation of the balance of Advances for Payroll and Advances to Officers and Employees account.
