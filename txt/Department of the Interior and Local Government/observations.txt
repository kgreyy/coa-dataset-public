PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 
 
Misstatements/Errors and Omissions in the Financial Statements - ₱57,768,185.56 
 
1. The reliability of DILG’s Consolidated Financial Statements cannot be 

established due to accounting errors and omissions totalling ₱57,768,185.56 
comprising of a) misstatement in Cash in Bank account; b) discrepancy between 
inventory reports and accounting records; c) errors in the recording of Property, 
Plant and Equipment; d) errors in recording in the subsidiary ledgers of Due to 
GOCCs and Other Payables accounts; and e) misclassification  of legal services, 
which resulted in the misstatement of affected accounts. 

 

1.1 Section 15, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of the Government Accounting Manual for 
National Government Agencies (GAM for NGAS) requires that the financial 
statements (FS) present fairly the Financial Position, Financial Performance and 
Cash Flows of an entity.  Fair presentation requires faithful representation of 
effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the 
definitions and recognition criteria for assets. 

 
1.2 Moreover, Section 111 of the Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 requires that 

the accounts of the agency be kept in such detail as necessary to meet the needs 
of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed 
by fiscal or control agencies of the government.   

 

1.3 The audit of accounts and transactions of DILG covering CY 2020, disclosed 
total uncorrected misstatements/accounting errors and omissions amounting to 
₱57,768,185.56 which affected the fair presentation of the financial statements as 
discussed in detail in the succeeding paragraphs.  

 

 
CASH IN BANK

  Totals  43,323,585.05          
 

a) Unrecorded adjustment for unissued checks 
 

1.5 Section 56, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAS, Volume I provides that a 
schedule of Unreleased Commercial Checks shall be prepared by the Cashier for 
submission to the Accounting Division/Unit.   

 
1.6 In NCR, verification disclosed that checks totaling ₱1,017,820.38 were still in 

the possession of the Cashier but not reverted/restored to the Cash in Bank – 
Local Currency Current Account as of December 31, 2020.  As per inquiry, the 
cashier failed to prepare the schedule of unreleased checks and submit the same 
to the Accounting Division which prevented the preparation of Journal Entry 
Voucher (JEV) to restore cash equivalent of unreleased checks at year-end as 
required under Section 56, Chapter 19, of the GAM Volume 1. 

 
b) Non-cancellation of Stale Checks 

 
1.7 Section 44, Volume I of the GAM for NGAS states:  “Checks may be cancelled 

when they become stale, voided or spoiled.  The depository bank considers a 
check stale, if it has been outstanding for over six months from date of issue or 



57 
 

as prescribed.”  However, the expiry period of MDS check was reduced from six 
(6) months to three (3) months from date of issue with the issuance of Treasury 
Circular No. 03-2017 dated October 20, 2017.  

 
1.8 In Region III, verification of Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) for Cash in 

Bank, Local Currency, Current Account revealed that stale checks totaled to 
₱97,424.00.   These checks were cancelled only on February 15, 2021 under 
Journal Entry Voucher No. 2021-02-07. 
 

1.9 Inquiry with Management disclosed that these stale checks were not adjusted 
back to the Cash in Bank because they are waiting for payees to surrender the 
stale checks and then issue a replacement. 

 
1.10 In Region IVA, verification of BRS of DILG – Quezon Provincial Office 

showed that 42 claimed checks totaling ₱135,268.64 have been stale for more 
than 10 to 33 months 

 
c) Unrecorded credit memos 

 
1.11 In Region IX, deposits to the Trust-LGA and Trust-Regular accounts amounting 

to ₱612,705.84 and ₱74,049.00, respectively, or a total of ₱686,754.84 were not 
recorded in the books; thus, understating the Cash-in Bank – Local Currency, 
Current Account and the corresponding income accounts by ₱686,754.84. 
Breakdown of which is as follows: 

 

Particulars Amount Nature/Remarks 
Bank Credit Memo ₱ 545,883.84 From Local Government Academy 
Transfer Authority/ 
Bank Credit Memo 
(CM) 

62,049.00 Transfer from RO Trust-Regular for which 
Management has no idea as to the nature and 
purpose of the transfer 

Cash deposit 4,773.00 No details of this deposit 
Sub-total  612,705.84  
Transfer Authority 74,049.00 Cash deposits to RO Trust-Regular account 

which nature is also unknown 
Total ₱ 686,754.84  

 

1.12 Management acknowledged the deficiency on unrecorded bank credit memo 
(CM) amounting to ₱62,049.00 which was due to Report of Collections and 
Deposits that was not received by the Cash Section as of reporting date due to 
COVID outbreak. 

 

1.13 With regard to the bank CM of ₱545,883.84, the amount pertains to the deposit 
of fund transferred by LGA without supporting DV or any communication given 
to Management.  This was confirmed later when the Accountant requested the 
SL from LGA to reconcile all accounts transferred to the Region.

d) Double-recording of disbursements 
 

1.14 In Region IX, reimbursement of travelling expenses amounting to ₱13,500.00 by 
contract tracers of Zamboanga del Sur Provincial Office under Check Nos. 
3266585 to 3266593 were recorded twice in the Check Disbursement Journal 
(CkDJ); thus, overstating the Travelling Expenses and understating the Cash in 
Bank – LCCA both by ₱13,500.00. 

 
e) Unrecorded disbursements 

 
1.15 Unrecorded disbursements amounting to ₱31,047,005.46 were noted in Region 

IX due to failure of the designated Disbursing Officer (DO) to upload amounts to 
the Gdrive (online format in the submission of report), though these were 
reported in the Cash in Bank Register which were submitted at a later date; thus, 
not included in the financial statements as at year-end. Details of which are as 
follows: 

 
Office November December Total 

Zamboanga del Norte Prov’l Office  ₱ 14,611,304.31 ₱16,435,701.15 ₱31,047,005.46 
 

1.16 These unrecorded disbursements pertained to the wages of the contract tracers 
assigned to the said province. 

 
f) Unrecorded bank debit memos (DM) 

 
1.17 Also in Region IX, bank DMs amounting to ₱10,325,811.73 were not recorded 

in the books because these were not included in the Cash in Bank Register of the 
field office.  Details of which are as follows: 

 
Office November December Total 

Zamboanga del Norte Prov’l Office ₱ 4,255,150.63 ₱ 6,008,612.10 ₱ 10,263,762.73  
Regional Office: Trust – Regular 62,049.00  62,049.00 
Total ₱ 4,317,199.63  ₱ 6,008,612.10   ₱ 10,325,811.73   

 
1.18 We recommended that Management require/direct the: 

 
a. Disbursing Officer (DO) and the Accountant to strictly comply with the 

provisions of Section 56, Chapter 19, Volume 1 of the GAM for NGAs 
relative to preparation of Schedule of Unreleased Checks and JEV to 
recognize restoration of cash and liabilities in order to present the true 
balance of both accounts in the financial statements;   
 

b. DO to notify payees with stale checks in their possession for cancellation 
and replacement. Make sure that such cancellation/ replacement will be 
reported in the Regional Office for appropriate adjustment/s in the 
books of accounts; 
 



59 
 

c. Accountant to verify the nature of unrecorded deposits/bank Credit 
Memo (CM) amounting to ₱686,754.84 and submit necessary documents 
as basis of the bank CM and make necessary adjusting entries; 
 

d. Accountant to make necessary adjusting entry affecting the Cash in 
Bank –Local Currency Current Account and Accumulated 
Surplus/Deficit account; and 
 

e. Accountant to make a representation with the bank for immediate 
submission of supporting documents for bank DMs amounting to 
₱10,325,811.73 and prepare a JEV to recognize the same in the books.   

 
1.19 Management commented that they will adhere to the recommendations and 

commits to submit the necessary documents, effect the corresponding adjusting 
entries and to be more cautious in their review and preparation of Financial 
Reports. 
 
 

INVENTORY 
 

Discrepancy between the RPCI and accounting records 
 

1.20 Section 13, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, requires agencies to 
regularly conduct a semi-annual physical count of inventory items to check the 
integrity of property custodianship. 

 
1.21 In CAR, the physical count of inventories is compared with Supplies Ledger 

Cards (SLC) maintained by the Accounting Unit to determine shortage and 
overage in the quantity and value of inventory items in the Report on the 
Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI).  Discrepancies reported in the RPCI shall 
be reconciled with the SLC and Stock Cards (SC) maintained by the Supply Unit 
and shall be verified and/or adjusted accordingly. 

 
1.22 The RPCI as of December 31, 2020 disclosed differences between the SLC and 

the physical count in 25 inventory items amounting to ₱250,610.24 after partial 
reconciliation was undertaken by the Inventory Committee.  Causes of 
differences and its effect in the Office Supply Inventory account as of December 
31, 2020 were determined, as follows: 

 
Cause Overstated (Understated) 

1. Non- recording of issuances/ non-submission of RIS to record issuances ₱58,898.34 
2.  Non-recording of deliveries (1,373.00) 
4.  Error in the quantity issued in the SLC 193,169.88 
5.  Error in the quantity issued in the RIS/SC (19.68) 
6.  No approved RIS for inventories issued (65.30) 
Net overstatement ₱250,610.24

1.23 We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting 
Section and the General Services Section to complete the reconciliation of 
RPCI and Accounting records and adjust the balances of Supplies Ledger 
Card and Stock Cards accordingly. 
 

1.24 Management commented that reconciliation of RPCI and accounting records was 
completed in February 2021 and the difference of P250,610.24 were adjusted 
under JEV Nos. 21-01-323, 330, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 356 & 382.

a) PPE recorded twice in the books of account 
 

1.26 In Central Office, Communication Equipment amounting to ₱262,239.79 was 
recorded twice in the books of accounts. 

 
b) Semi-expendable items recorded as PPE 

 
1.27 Section 4, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that the 

capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 represents the minimum cost of an 
individual asset recognized as a PPE on the Statement of Financial Position.  

 
1.28 In CAR, semi-expendable properties totaling ₱499,859.00 were recorded as PPE 

but the unit cost of each item is below the capitalization threshold.  Likewise, the 
same condition exist for 19 semi-expendable items totaling ₱96,612.00 which 
were recorded under Communication Equipment in the NCR and similarly in 
Region III, semi-expendable items totaling ₱2,680,136.99 were still carried 
under various PPE accounts. 

 
c) Misclassification of accounts 
 

1.29 In CAR, cubicles installed in 2020 amounting to ₱900,300.00 were recorded 
under Buildings account while the RPCPPE reported the same in the Furniture 
and Fixtures account.  The installation should have been correctly recorded as 
Furniture and Fixtures following the Revised Chart of Accounts. 

 
1.30 Likewise, verification disclosed that 10 units of laptop in NCR amounting to 

₱360,000.00 were recorded as Office Equipment instead of ICT Equipment 
resulting in the overstatement of the Office Equipment account by ₱360,000.00 
and the understatement of ICT Equipment by the same amount. 

 
d) Unrecorded PPE  

 
1.31 The following PPE items were not recorded in the books of account: 

 
Office/Region Amount Remarks 

CO ₱5,308,771.44 108 items of PPE aggregating ₱5.309 million were 
counted by the Property Section but not recorded in

1.32 We recommended that Management require the: 
 

a. Accounting Office and Property Section to conduct periodic 
reconciliation of records and prepare necessary adjustments, if any; and 

 
b. Accountant to prepare necessary adjustments for errors identified for 

fair presentation of affected accounts. 
 

1.33 Management provided the following comments: 
 

Office Comments 
CO On-going verification of Communication Equipment amounting to 

₱262,239.79 is being conducted by the Accounting Division.  Any update 
will be reflected in the COA status of implementation. 
 
Upon validation of the 108 items totaling ₱5,308,771.44 not recorded in the 
books of accounts, 105 items have been reconciled/adjusted as of February 
2021, thus the unrecorded balance was only ₱149,530.00 which is subject to 
reconciliation. 

NCR Continuous reconciliation is being done by Accounting Section and SGSS.  
Likewise, reclassification entry was made per JEV No. 21-02-0016 dated 
February 28, 2021.   

 
 

LIABILITY  
 
 Negative/Abnormal Balance 
 

1.34 Negative and abnormal balances of SLs in the CO amounting to ₱8,984.76 and 
₱71,166.91, respectively, were included in reported balances of Due to GOCCs 
and Other Payables, respectively. 

 
1.35 We recommended that Management require the Accountant to exert best 

efforts to identify the cause/s of negative balances and make necessary 
adjustments accordingly. 

 

1.36 Management commented that the negative balances amounting to ₱80,151.67 
was reduced by ₱30,365.68 as of this CY 2021 as a result of continuous review 
and reconciliation of said abnormal balance. 

 
EQUITY 

 
Misclassification of legal services 

 
1.37 Under Vol. III of the GAM for NGAS, Other General Services and Legal 

Services are described as follows: 



63 
 

 
Other General Services 
 
 This account is debited to recognize the cost of other general services 
contracted by the agency not otherwise classified under any of the specific 
general services accounts. xxxxx 
 
Legal Services 
 
This account is debited to recognize the cost incurred for authorized legal 
services, rendered by private lawyers or lawyers from other government 
agencies, excluding legal defense expenses.  This includes special counsel 
allowances granted to government lawyers from other agencies deputized to 
represent the government in court as special counsel. 
 

Retainers Fee of Private Lawyers Charged and Recorded under Other General 
Services account 
 

1.38 Per verification, compensation in consideration for services of the private 
lawyers amounting to P1,687,464.58 was charged against Locally-Funded 
Project, Support for Local Governance Program and was recorded as expense 
under the Other General Services Account. 

 
1.39 We noted that retainers’ fee of concerned private lawyers should have been 

charged and recorded under Legal Services which is appropriately descriptive of 
the transaction for services as legal counsel. 

 
1.40 We recommended that Management provide basis for charging 

compensation of hired private lawyers against funds appropriated for 
Locally-Funded Project, Support for Local Governance Program (SLGP) 
and recording the same under Other General Services account. 

 
Management Comments 

 
1.41 Management commented that the approved Annual Operations Plan and Budget 

(AOPB) of SLGP for FY 2020 indicating that Bantay Korapsyon is contributory 
to the outcomes of SLGP and approved realigned/catch up of AOPB FY 2020. 
 

1.42 Since 2018, the SLGP has been trapped to support the initiatives of the 
Department in fleshing out concrete responses to the presidential directives on 
reducing corruption in LGUs. The support started with policy development 
works that led to the launching of the Barangay Kaagapay (which was 
renamed/rebranded later as Bantay Korapsyon) and later to the conduct of 
“Ugnayan at Talakayan: Bantay Kaagapay sa Patuloy na Pag-unlad Program”. 
The talakayan series was designed as the launching of the Program which was 
attended by DILG field officers who and graced by the SILG. 



64 
 

 
1.43 In May 2019, the SLGP produced a “Report on Transparency, Good Governance 

and Anti-Corruption Mechanisms under the SLGP Program” which cited its 
support to the Bantay Korapsyon initiative. 
 

1.44 In September 2019, the SLGP produced a policy paper for the Department titled: 
“Addressing Local Corruption: Inputs to impact-oriented policy and program 
development” which was the product of the “Write shop-Forum on Anti-
Corruption Initiatives”. 
 

1.45 Both forum and paper laid the foundation of the current program of the 
Department. 

 
Accounting Deficiencies - ₱135,531,149.79 
 
2. The accuracy, completeness and valuation of the reported accounts in the 

financial statements cannot be ascertained due to accounting deficiencies, such 
as: a) discrepancies between the balances per books and bank, registries, records 
of implementing/source agencies and  property records; b) unaccounted balance 
of fund transfer in the books of DILG NCR; and c) inclusion of negative amount 
in the Due from NGAs account of DILG NCR and amount labeled as “For 
Reconciliation or Unrecon” in the balance of Due to GOCCs and Other 
Payables. 

 
2.1 These accounting deficiencies are discussed in the succeeding paragraphs: 

 
 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

 
a. Unreconciled balances between the books and the bank 

 
2.2 Chapter 21, Volume 1 of the GAM for NGAs provides the following policies and 

guidelines in the preparation of BRS: 
 
Sec. 3. The BRS shall be prepared in order to: (a) check correctness of both the 
banks’ and agency’s/entity’s records; (b) serve as deterrent to fraud; and (c) 
enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or credits recognized by the 
bank or agency/entity but not yet known to the agency/entity or bank. 
 
Sec. 4.  The monthly BRS shall be prepared by the Chief Accountant/designated 
staff for each of the bank accounts maintained by the agency/entity using the 
Adjusted Balance Method. Under this method, the book balance and the bank 
balance are brought to an adjusted balance that must appear on the Statement of 
Financial Position. 

 



65 
 

2.3 Unreconciled balances per books and per bank under Cash in Bank, LCCA, were 
observed for active accounts of NCR and Region III totalling ₱31,367,161.24.

10,818,549.30 8,595,372.77 2,223,176.53 
0712-1040-23 

 
2.4 In NCR, based on prior year's audit, the unreconciled difference was the result of 

non-preparation of BRS from August to December 2018 which should have 
identified the irregularities in the accounting records brought about by errors or 
unrecorded related transactions affecting correctness/accuracy of the account. 

 
2.5 It appeared that reconciliation of the book and bank balances from August to 

December 2018 was not undertaken since the difference of ₱2,223,176.53 
remained unaccounted and uncorrected contrary to the existing guidelines.  Thus, 
making the balance of Cash in Bank -LCCA doubtful. 

 
2.6 Moreover, verification disclosed that the Cash in Bank -LCCA comprised of two 

bank accounts maintained with the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) North 
Avenue Branch, to wit: 

 
Account Name Account No. 

DILG-NCR Special Project - Local Government Academy (LGA)  0712-1040-15 
DILG-NCR Special Project - Regional Peace and Order Council 0712-1040-23 

 
2.7 It was observed that the Accounting Section prepares only one BRS for these 

two bank accounts contrary to Section 4, Chapter 21, Volume 1, GAM for NGAs 
which requires preparation of BRS for each of the bank accounts maintained. 

 
2.8 Failure to comply with the guidelines on BRS preparation defeats the primary 

objective of bank reconciliation which is to check correctness of both book and 
bank records.  It also affected the fair presentation of Cash in Bank accounts in 
the financial statements at any given period as details of book balance was not 
ascertained. 

 
b. Unreconciled balances between the balance per book and registries 

 
2.9 In Region III, review of records disclosed that the Cash in Bank - LCCA has a 

balance of ₱115,028,615.16 as of year-end which does not reconcile with the 
balance of ₱85,614,630.45 per Cash in Bank Register contrary to above-
mentioned regulations. 

 
2.10 Verification of SL balances of the Regional Accounting Office as compared with 

the balance per Cash in Bank Register of Provincial Offices disclosed a 
discrepancy of ₱29,413,984.71 



66 
 

 
2.11 Interview with the Regional Accountant revealed that the discrepancy pertained 

to disbursements not yet recorded in the books due to delayed submission of 
reports of Provincial Offices.  

 
2.12 Failure of Regional Accountant to record said transaction in the books of 

accounts resulted in the overstatement of the Cash in Bank accounts and the 
understatement or overstatement of affected accounts.  

 
2.13 We recommended that Management:  

 
a. direct the Accountant in NCR to account the difference of ₱2,223,176.53 

by preparing the BRS for each bank account from August to December 
2018 and effect the necessary adjustments in the books to present the 
correct balance of the Cash in Bank –Local Currency Current Account 
at any given period; 

 
b. require the Provincial Offices to submit the Cash in Bank Register  

along with  its supporting  documents within five days at the end of each 
month; and  

 
c. require the Accountant to prepare the necessary adjustments to record 

disbursements for the month of December 2020 of Provincial Offices.

c. Unreconciled discrepancies between the balances per books and IAs 
 

2.14 Comparison of balances per books of DILG and results of confirmation with 
Implementing Agencies (IAs) disclosed a total discrepancy of ₱26,509,984.12

a. investigate discrepancies noted and make necessary adjustments, if 

warranted; and  
 
b. coordinate/ reconcile with implementing agencies relative to the 

unrecorded liquidations. 
 

2.16 Management commented the following: 
 

Office Comment 
CO Fund transferred to DECS and LGA amounting to ₱200,000.00 and ₱100,000.00, 

respectively, were not recorded in their respective books of accounts and formed 
part of the request for write-off. 
 

IV-A The Regional Office is preparing an updated reconciliation report of receivable 
accounts which they will submit to the Audit Team upon completion. 

 
 

d. Unaccounted negative amount in Due from NGAS – PS -DBM – NCR 
 

2.17 In the NCR, the balance of Due from National Government Agencies – PS- 
DBM includes negative amount of ₱44,754.17 due to deliveries of PS-DBM 
which exceeded the advance payments. The Audit Team requested for party 
ledger card from PS - BM but as to date the same has yet to be received. In the 
absence of document to reconcile and verify the delivery, liquidation and fund 
transfer made, the accuracy of the reported account balance cannot be 
established. 

 
2.18 We recommended that Management require the Accounting Section and 

Supply and General Service Section (SGSS) to reconcile their records with 
that of the PS-DBM and prepare necessary adjustment, if warranted. 

 



68 
 

2.19 Management commented that SGSS already communicated with PS-DBM, 
however, the PS-DBM still cannot submit the requested breakdown of the items. 

 
 
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 

 
e. Unreconciled difference between accounting and property records - ₱70.149 

Million  
 

2.20 Sec. 53, Chapter 3, Volume 1II of the Government Accounting and Auditing 
Manual (GAAM) provides that “Accountability for the custody and use of an 
asset is to be assigned and maintained and periodic comparison shall be made of 
the existing asset with the recorded accountability and appropriate action taken 
on any differences. xxx.”  

 
2.21 Section 42(g) Chapter 10, Volume 1 of the GAM describes Report of Physical 

Count of PPE (RPCPPE) as the form which shall be used to report the physical 
count and condition of PPE by type as of a given date, including those which are 
unrecorded and those which could not be accounted for.  It shows the balance of 
PPE per property cards and per count and shortage/overage, if any.  It shall be 
rendered by the Inventory Committee, on its yearly physical count of properties 
owned by the entity. 
 

2.22 The balances per Accounting records and RPCPPE did not reconcile showing a 
total variance of ₱70.149 million, as shown below:

Total   ₱70,148,931.78 

 
2.23 We recommended that Management require the Accounting and Property 

Office to conduct periodic reconciliation of their records and prepare 
necessary adjustments, if any. 

 
2.24 Management provided the following comments: 

 
Office Comments 

CO Initial results of the on-going reconciliation include the following: 
a. For 168 items per PPE Accounting schedules not reflected in the 

RPCPPE totaling ₱16,321,351.98, adjustment was made to record the 
33 items amounting to ₱1,092,042.92 per PPE accounting schedules.  
The remaining 135 items will be subjected to reconciliation efforts by 
Property Section and Accounting Office until the second quarter of FY 



69 
 

Office Comments 
2021. 

b. Additionally, management commented that as of June 30, 2021, a total 
of ₱9,806,047.66 or 60 percent of the ₱16,321,351.98 PPE not 
reflected in the RPCPPE were reconciled. 

c. For 108 items in the RCPPE not recorded in the books totaling 
₱5,308,771.44, upon validation in the books of accounts as of February 
28, 2021, 105 items have been reconciled/adjusted. 

d. On the 393 items of ICT equipment where cost reflected in the RCPPE 
was more than the recorded cost in the accounting books due to 
typographical error made in the RCPPE, the difference of ₱81,557.28 
on the acquisition cost of PPE was already verified and corrected. 

NCR Continuous reconciliation is being done by Accounting Section and SGSS.  
Likewise, reclassification entry was recorded under JEV No. 21-02-0016 
dated February 28, 2021. 
   

CAR As of June 30, 2021, reconciliation of PPE for CY 2020 as per records of 
the Accounting and RPCPPE of General Services Sections was completed. 
 
As a result of the reconciliation, the following JEVs were prepared to 
record the adjustments in PPE: 01-0863, 0871, 0857, 0866, 0871, & 0872; 
and 06-3181, 3182, 3188, 3199, 3200, 3306, 3329, 3334, 3352, 3412, 
3480, 3491, 3558, 3561, & 3625. 
 

VI Reconciliation of records between AS and Supply Unit will be scheduled 
within 10 days after the approval of the RPCPPE annually. Adjustments 
were made through JEV No. 2021-01-007 to JEV 2021-01-010. 
 

XII Management is amenable to the non-reconciliation of their PPE account 
versus RPCPPE and other observed deficiencies by the Audit Team. There 
was an attempt to address the problem on reconciliation in CY 2020 
through conduct of physical count scheduled in March 2020 to verify 
existence of PPE items against accounting records which will be the basis 
for its beginning balance. However, the plan was postponed due to the 
occurrence of the pandemic.  A physical count was scheduled in March 
2021 to validate the variances noted in audit and adjust the same 
accordingly. 

 
 
LIABILITY 

 
f. Unreconciled amounts of Liability Accounts 
 

2.25 In Central Office, the balance of Due to GOCCs and Other Payables include 
amounts labeled as “For Reconciliation or Unrecon” amounting to ₱11,779.69 
and ₱1,413,089.00, respectively, rendering the ending balances of said accounts 



70 
 

inaccurate.  Per inquiry, these are transferred balances from trust liabilities 
account during migration of data from NGAS to e-NGAS in October 2014. 

 
g. Unaccounted balances of Fund Transfers (FT) from Source Agencies (SA) 

 

2.26 Section 6.3 of COA Circular No. 94-013 provides that Implementing Agencies 
(IAs) have duties and responsibilities to keep separate subsidiary records for the 
trust liability whether or not a separate bank account is maintained. 

 
2.27 In NCR, verification disclosed that the balance of Due to NGAs includes 

unaccounted amount of ₱2,427,298.45 which the Accounting Section failed to 
provide a breakdown or details due to inadequacy of subsidiary records. 

 
h. Difference between balances per books and SAs  

 
2.28 In the Central Office, comparison of balances per books and results of 

confirmation with Source Agencies, a total discrepancy of ₱3.338 million was 
noted due to the reasons cited in the “Remarks” column of the table below:

2.30 Management submitted the following comments: 

 
Office Management Comments 

CO  “For reconciliation/Unrecon” account, Management is trying to retrieve 
the original entry made in 2006 when eNGAS was implemented to 
analyze, validate and make necessary adjustment if warranted. 
 
On difference between balances per books and Source Agencies, 
various actions were undertaken such as validation, verification, 
adjustment and refund.  

NCR Management commented that in the past years, no record and SL found 
on file as basis of reporting under Due to NGAs account.  Efforts in 
retrieving documents such as DVs, collections and bank statements 
from flooded files and computer files during Typhoon Ondoy were also 
done.  However, still no records of payable account from other NGAs.

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 
 
Weakness in Cash Management 

 
3. Weakness in cash management was noted resulting from: a) deficiencies in 

granting and handling of Petty Cash Fund; b) insufficient and failure to renew 
Fidelity Bond of Disbursing Officer; c) failure of Accountable Officers to 
maintain Cash Disbursement Record (CDR); and d) failure to liquidate cash 
advances within the prescribed period, contrary to the existing rules and 
regulations. 
 

a) Deficiencies in the granting and handling of Petty Cash Fund (PCF) 
 
      Regular expenses paid thru PCF 

 
3.1 Section 35, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I states that, the Petty 

Cash Fund (PCF) shall be sufficient for the recurring petty operating expenses 
of the agency for one month. It shall be maintained using the Imprest System. It 
shall not be used for payment of regular expenses such as rentals, subscriptions, 
light and water bills, purchase of supplies and materials for stock purposes and 
the like. 

 
3.2 In Central Office, review of the petty cash replenishment showed that 

disbursements for newspaper expenses totaled to P112,252.00 covering the 
period from August 8, 2019 to August 3, 2020. These disbursements were 
recorded in the books under Subscription Expenses accounts. 

 
3.3 Considering that the newspaper was delivered daily or regularly to different 

DILG offices and it is a recurring/regular expense of the Office recorded as 
Subscription Expenses, the same should not be paid through the Petty Cash 
Fund pursuant to Section 35, Chapter 6 of the GAM. 

  
   Non-use of Petty Cash Voucher (PCV) and Report on Paid Petty Cash 

Vouchers (RPPCV) 
 

3.4 Section 35a of Chapter 6, GAM, Volume I provides among others that, 
Payments out of PCF, which shall be made through a Petty Cash Voucher 
(PCV) (Appendix 48), should be allowed only for amounts not exceeding 



73 
 

₱15,000 for each transaction, except when a higher amount is allowed by law 
and/or specific authority by the COA. Splitting of transactions to avoid 
exceeding the ceiling shall not be allowed.  All disbursements out of PCF shall 
be covered by duly accomplished and approved PCV supported by cash 
invoices, ORs or other evidence of disbursements. 

 
3.5 Appendices 48 and 49, GAM, Volume II, require the use of PCV for payments 

out of PCF and RPPCV which shall be the basis in the preparation of DV to 
replenish his/her PCF. All liquidated PCVs shall be attached to the RPPCV 
together with all supporting documents. 

 
3.6 Cash examination in NCR disclosed that PCV was not used by AOs for 

payments from the PCF.  Moreover, AOs did not use the RPPCV in reporting 
disbursements out of PCF for replenishment.  These practices are inconsistent 
with the provisions of Section 35a, Chapter 6, GAM, Volume I and Appendices 
48 and 49 of GAM, Volume II.     

 
Non-compliance with documentary requirements in the liquidation of Petty 
Cash Fund 

 
3.7 Sections 36-38, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, prescribe the 

documentary requirements, accounting books, records, forms, reports and 
procedures for the grant, utilization and liquidation of Petty Cash Fund. 

 
3.8 In Region V, audit of petty cash disbursements by the Petty Cash Custodian 

disclosed lacking documents and discrepancies from the supporting official 
receipts amounting to ₱26,221.38. 

 
3.9 The petty cash disbursements did not comply with documentary requirements 

for liquidation of PCF as provided under the GAM for NGAs, Vol.1 and lacked 
proper review as to completeness and propriety of supporting documents; hence, 
resulted in the payment of claims against government funds without proper and 
complete documentation. 

 
3.10 We recommended that Management:  

 
a. strictly adhere to accounting policies on disbursement by checks and 

setting-up of cash advance for petty operating expenses as provided in 
Sections 8 and 35, Chapter 6 of GAM, Vol. 1;  

 
b. require Accountable Officers (AOs) to use Petty Cash Voucher for 

payments out of PCF and RPPCV for reporting disbursements out of 
PCF for replenishment, in compliance to the provisions of GAM; and  

 



74 
 

c. require the AOs to ensure that petty cash disbursements are adequately 
supported with necessary documents in compliance with the GAM for 
NGAs to avoid suspension in audit.  

 
3.11 Management commented that they have already issued a memorandum directing 

all AOs handling Petty Cash Fund to use the GAM forms. 
 

3.12 Furthermore, Management stopped the granting of Petty Cash Fund for payment 
of newspaper for FY 2021. 

 
b) Insufficient and failure to renew Fidelity Bond of Disbursing Officer  
 

3.13 Quoted hereunder are pertinent rules and regulations on the granting and 
liquidation of CAs and bonding of AOs: 
  

-    Paragraph 2, Section 101 of PD No. 1445 otherwise known as the 
Government Auditing Code of the Philippines states that: Every 
accountable officer shall be properly bonded in accordance with law.  

 
-    Section 7.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, as 

amended by COA Circular No. 2006-005 dated July 13, 2006 prescribes 
that, each accountable officer whose total accountability is not less than 
₱5,000.00 shall be bonded.  The amount of bond shall depend on the 
total accountability of the officer as fixed by the Head of the Agency.  
An official or employee who has both money and property 
accountability, shall be bonded only once to cover both accountabilities, 
but the amount of the bond shall be in accordance with the Schedule. 

 
-    Section 7.5 of the same COA Circular further provides that, the amount 

of bond necessary for the cash accountability of the AO shall be in 
accordance with the schedule of cash accountability and bond issued by 
the Bureau of the Treasury. 

 
-    Section 4.1.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 

states that: No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official 
or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first 
settled or a proper accounting thereof is made. 

 
3.14 In NCR, review of SLs of concerned AOs revealed that additional cash 

advances were granted despite existence of unliquidated balances, contrary to 
Section 89 of PD 1445 and Section 4.1.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated 
February 10, 1997.     

 
3.15 As a result thereof, their accountabilities increased which exceeded the 

maximum limit covered by their fidelity bond, as shown in the following table. 
 
 



75 
 

Accountable Officer 
Maximum 
Accounta-

bility 

Balance of Cash Advances

 Jean Redi T. Briones ₱250,000.00 Sept 4, 2018 Sept. 27, 2018 ₱253,080.00 ₱324,180.00 
 Ednalyn Trixia C. Castillo 455,000.00 Dec. 2, 2019 Dec. 26, 2019 482,535.00 651,265.00 

 

3.16 The insufficiency of the bond exposes the government to the risk of not being 
fully indemnified in case of loss of public funds through breach of fidelity. 

 
3.17 In Region III, a Disbursing Officer continued to handle check disbursement 

transactions despite non-renewal of the required fidelity bond contrary to 
Section 4.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009. 
 

3.18 We recommended that Management:  
 

a. stop the grant of cash advances to Accountable Officers with unsettled 
accounts in line with Section 89 of PD 1445 and Section 4.1.2 of COA 
Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 in order to prevent 
accumulation of unliquidated cash advances beyond the maximum limit 
of the bond; and 

 
b.  require the concerned Accountable Officers to apply for fidelity bond 

sufficient to cover their accountabilities. 
 

3.19 For NCR, Management concurred to the observation on granting additional cash 
advances to AOs exceeding their bonds.  This was due to various and 
simultaneous activities conducted by DILG-NCR. 

 
3.20 For Region III, Management commented that the fidelity bond of the AO in 

DILG-Aurora was already renewed with Risk No. 18-21-0846 N dated February 
12, 2021.  Moreover, Management assured the Audit Team to strengthen their 
control over cash and strictly comply with the regulation. 

 

c) Failure to maintain Cash Disbursement Record (CDR) 
 

3.21 Cash examination conducted in NCR revealed that the three AOs failed to 
present their Cash Disbursement Record or cashbook as they do not maintain 
the same, contrary to Section 17, GAM, Volume I and Appendix 40 of GAM, 
Volume II.  In view thereof, the required daily recording of transactions as well 
as the reconciliation of cashbook balance and cash on hand was not undertaken. 

 
3.22 Inquiry with AOs disclosed that they are not aware of records to be maintained 

in the proper handling of cash advances. 
 

3.23 Though AOs did not incur any shortage or overage, it is required to maintain 
records that should reconcile with accounting records regularly for purposes of 
establishing, monitoring and control of accountability. 

 



76 
 

3.24 We recommended that Management require the AOs to maintain the 
prescribed Cash Disbursement Record to record daily transactions and 
monitor cash advance balance.  Likewise, instruct the Chief Accountant to 
brief newly designated AOs on matters related to their duties.  

 
3.25 Management commented that training of all AOs and SDOs was already 

conducted in previous years to assist them in the proper recording of daily cash 
transactions in the CDRec.  However, due to various activities which primarily 
focuses on major deliverables and activities of DILG-NCR, updating and re-
echoing of the matter were not sustained.  To adhere to the recommendation, 
Management will incorporate in future activities administrative matters 
including proper recording in CDRec. 

 

d) Failure to liquidate /settle the CA within the prescribed period 
 

3.26 Section 89 of PD 1445 states that, a cash advance shall be reported on and 
liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served. No 
additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the 
previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting 
thereof is made.  

 
3.27 Pertinent provisions of COA Cir. No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 states 

that: 
 

Section 5.1 – The Accountable Officer shall liquidate cash advance 
on Salaries, Wages, etc. within five (5) days after each fifteen (15) 
day/end of the month pay period. 
 
Section 5.1.3 – Official Travel - within sixty (60) days after return to 
the Philippines in the case of foreign travel or within thirty (30) days 
after return to his permanent official station in the case of local 
travel, as provided for in EO 248 and COA Circular No. 96-004. 
 
Section 5.7 - When a cash advance is no longer needed or has not 
been used for a period of two (2) months, it must be returned to or 
refunded immediately to the collecting officer. 

 
3.28 Verification and analysis of cash advances in Region II revealed that liquidation 

of advances for travel amounting to ₱90,192.00 was delayed by nine months. 
The delayed submission of liquidation and refund of unutilized cash advances 
beyond the prescribed period precluded timely recording/recognition of

3.29 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. require the Accountable Officer to immediately liquidate cash advance 
by refunding the amount of ₱90,192.00; and 

 
b. ensure strict compliance to the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 

pertinent to the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances. 
 

3.30 Management commented that refund of Cash Advance shall be made as soon as 
the travel agency refund the same. Records of exchange of communication 
between the AO and the travel agency were submitted to show that AO exerted 
effort in demanding the travel agency to refund cost of the unused plane tickets.  
 

3.31 As per additional comment received from Management on July 22, 2021, the 
cash advance was already liquidated under Journal Entry Voucher No. (CRJ) 
01-2021-096-00 dated March 31, 2021, duly supported by OR No. 8100299 
dated March 17, 2021, representing refund of  P90,192.00. 

 
 

Non-remittance of unutilized funds to BTr 
 

4. Unutilized operating funds of City/Provincial Offices in three regions totaling      
P61,414,137.92 were retained and not deposited to the Bureau of the Treasury 
contrary to Executive Order (EO) No. 388. 
 
4.1 EO No. 388 requires, all government offices and agencies to immediately 

transfer all public monies deposited with authorized government depository 
banks and other institutions to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr) regardless of 
source. COA-DBM Circular No. 1-97 dated January 2, 1997 was consequently 
issued which prescribes the guidelines for the implementation of EO No. 388. 

 
4.2 In Region I, the unutilized fund/excess fund balances in three Provincial Offices 

totaling P651,865.49 were not remitted to the BTr, contrary to the 
aforementioned regulations.  

 
4.3 In Region II, verification showed that the Agency had the practice of 

transferring funds from regular MDS Sub-Account to Cash in Bank - LCCA 
maintained by Provincial Offices more than their operational requirements such 
as salaries and wages and other MOOE in a given period. Thus, excess fund 
transfers of Provincial Offices (POs) had accumulated to P57,120,093.18 which 
remained unutilized as of December 31, 2020, broken down as follows: 

 
Account Name LBP Account No. Balance

4.4 Moreover, fund received from LGA on March 20, 2019 for Orientation on the 

Use of Competency Dashboard has unutilized balance of P21,193.86 as of 
December 31, 2020.  The validity of the fund expired on December 31, 2020 
pursuant to RA 11464; hence, the full amount is no longer available for 
disbursement and should be remitted to the National Treasury. 
 

4.5 In DILG Region XI, the operations of different DILG City and Provincial 
Offices are funded by the Regional Office (RO). The city and provincial offices 
maintained current account with the LBP.  Funds for Personal Services (PS) and 
MOOE are transferred from MDS Account of the RO thru Authority to Debit 
Account (ADA) to their respective LCCA accounts.  

 
4.6 Review of current accounts maintained by DILG Region XI and its different 

Provincial Offices showed that there are still huge bank balances of LCCA 
accounts at year end totaling P16,402,033.05 after deducting all expenses 
incurred for PS and MOOE for the calendar year.   Below are details of balances 
of LCCAs in the DILG City and Provincial Offices as of 31 December 2020, to

4.8 Bank balances for CY 2019 totaling P3,620,985.39 shall be reverted to the BTr 
since said amount can no longer be used for their operational expenses.  On the 
other hand, Bookkeepers of City and Provincial Offices shall determine if fund 
balances for CY 2020 represent excess allocation or still a continuing 
appropriation for use in the CY 2021 operations.  

 
4.9 The practice of transferring funds to POs more than their operational 

requirements could be a circumvention of DBM regulation that NCA shall be 
valid until the last working day of the 3rd month of the quarter. 

 
4.10 We recommended that Management: 

 
a. remit to BTr the unexpended amount from unimplemented trainings, 

savings from previous years’ MOOE and interest income from bank 
accounts and prepare necessary adjusting entries; and 

 
b. stop the practice of transferring funds to Provincial Offices more than 

their operational requirements at any given period to prevent existence 
of idle funds and maximize timely utilization of government resources. 

 
4.11 In Region I, the DILG POs replied that they will coordinate with DILG RO 

Accounting Section for the proper reversion and adjustment of unexpended funds. 
 

4.12 In Region II, Management acknowledged the practice of transferring fund to 
POs more than their operating requirements to avoid lapsing of NCA. Provincial 
Directors also emphasized that the bulk of their Cash in Bank -LCCA balance 
was intended for wages of Contact Tracers for December 2020 which were paid 
in January 2021. The Regional Director issued a memorandum to POs to refund 
the unexpended funds covering CY 2019. 
 

4.13 Additional comments provided by Management are as follows: 
 

a. The unexpended fund transfer of P7,017,687.91 to Provincial Offices in 
CY 2019 was refunded. Journal Entry Voucher (#CRJ) Nos. 01-2021-03-
096-00, 01-2021-04-189-00 01-2021-05-231-00 and 01-2021-06-237-00 
were drawn to record the collection and deposit to the National treasury. 

 



80 
 

b.  A total of P617,281.47 has been refunded and deposited to the National 
Treasury. Journal Entry Voucher # 01-2021-03-096-00 and 01-2021-05-
231-00 were drawn to record the transactions. 

 
c. As of July 16, 2021, the balance of unutilized fund transfer in the account 

of Provincial Offices is P14,467,636.61. This comprises centrally 
managed funds, special funds for the implementation of different PPAs of 
the department. 

 
4.14 In Region XI, Management commented that they already forwarded to DILG-

Central Office, particularly to the ASEC for Finance and Comptrollership last 
February 14, 2021 the letter seeking guidance on the closure of LCCA accounts 
in Provincial Offices. 
 

4.15 Management also commented that immediate closure of LCCA accounts 
without directions and guidance of the Central Office would adversely affect 
operations and functions of RO. 

 
Unliquidated Fund Transfers  

 
5. Fund transfers to national government agencies, government owned and/or 

controlled corporations, local government units, regional offices and non-
government organizations have accumulated to ₱3,629,683,340.01 as at year-end 
due to: a) non-submission of liquidation reports by Implementing Agencies (IAs) 
and Operating Units contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013 and 
related Memoranda of Agreement; and b) liquidation of fund transfers not 
supported with complete documentation. 

            
5.1 COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 prescribes the rules and 

regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to IAs. It 
states that within 10 days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period 
for the Project, the IA shall submit the RCI and ROD to report utilization of 
funds to the Source Agency (SA). The IA shall return to the SA any unused 
balance upon completion of the project. It further states that the SA shall require 
the IA to submit the required reports and furnish the IA with a copy of journal 
voucher taking up the expenditures.  

 
5.2 Additionally, Section 5.4 of COA Circular No. 2007-001 states that, within 60 

days after the completion of the project, the NGO shall submit the final Fund 
Utilization Report together with the supporting documents to the SA. 
 

5.3 Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 (Revised 
Guidelines and Documentary Requirements for Common Government 
Transactions) enumerates documentary requirements for transfer of funds as 
amended by COA Circular No. 2016-002 dated May 31, 2016 which includes 
among others, certification by the Accountant that funds previously transferred 



81 
 

to Implementing Agency (IA) has been liquidated and accounted for in the 
books. 
 

5.4 Section 3.1.3 of the same Circular listed the documentary requirements for 
liquidation of fund transfer as follows: 
 

•    Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and Report of Disbursements (ROD) 
certified correct by the Accountant, approved by the Head of the IA and 
duly audited by the Auditor of the  IA; 

•    Copy of Credit Notice issued by the Auditor of the IA; 

•    Copy of OR issued for the refund of unexpended/unutilized balance of 
fund transferred

Emergency Transport Vehicle/Ambulance for the Province of Davao del Norte. 
Repetitive changes on specifications of the vehicle to be purchased and 
requesting approval of modification caused the delay of the procurement process 
and made the account unliquidated as of December 31, 2020. 

 
5.18 Furthermore, the balance of ₱50,055,717.31 in Region XI pertains to completed 

projects but balances were not refunded/returned to Source Agency/BTr while 
the total amount of ₱13,246,462.05 pertains to unimplemented projects for which 
the fund remained idle for two years or more. 
 

5.19 Moreover, three LGUs in NCR were granted additional fund transfers totaling 
₱18,242,518.00 for the implementation of Resettlement Governance Assistance 
Fund (RGAF) although previous fund transfers remained not fully liquidated for 



86 
 

over one year. This signifies that the Accountant failed to strictly observe 
provisions of Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-011, which resulted in 
accumulation of unliquidated fund transfers to the City Governments of Manila, 
Caloocan and Valenzuela in the amounts of ₱5,317,080.51, ₱16,321,970.20 and 
₱8,052,518.00, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. 
 

5.20 Furthermore, liquidation of fund transfers amounting to ₱11,177,084.44 was 
recorded in the books based only on the RGAF monitoring reports. The Report 
of Checks Issued and Report of Disbursements were not attached to the 
liquidation report contrary to the above cited provisions. 

 
Due from Regional Offices (ROs) 

 
5.21 Due from Regional Offices account amounting to ₱4,137,894.59 consists of 

unliquidated fund transfers to ROs for implementation of various projects such 
as financial assistance for Typhoon Ompong victims, DTI-EODB, 
SALINTUBIG-DOH and RAPID Program.  
 

Due from Non-Government Organizations/Civil Society Organizations 
 

5.22 The reported balance of Due from NGOs/CSOs account of ₱6,646,350.83

5.23 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. strictly monitor and enforce liquidation of fund transfers in accordance 
with COA Circular No. 94-013 and relevant provisions of the MOA; 
and determine the cause for non-liquidation of the same;  
 

b. require Implementing Agencies to refund the unexpended balance for 
all completed undertakings; 

 
c. refrain from granting additional fund transfers to agencies with 

unliquidated balances and adhere strictly to the requirement of COA 
Circular No. 2016-002 dated May 31, 2016; and 

 
d. instruct the Chief Accountant to properly review liquidation report and 

see to it that documentary requirements are complete and compliant to 
Section 3.1.3 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prior to 
recording in the  books of accounts. 
 

5.24 Management commented the following: 
 

Office Comments 
CO Management instructed concerned Project Management Offices to regularly 

monitor and assess issues and concerns on the slow or non-implementation of 
projects to facilitate liquidation of receivables. 

NCR Management commented that implementation of some programs was put on hold 
due to COVID-19 pandemic, declaration of National State of Calamity and 
imposition of community quarantine measures or lockdowns in Metro Manila.  
Due to COVID-19, concerned LGUs have prioritized implementation of PPAs 
for addressing the spread of COVID-19 and providing assistance to their 
respective constituents. 

II The balance of Due from LGUs as of June 30, 2021 amounted to ₱253.265.50. 
This represents fund transfer to the Provincial Government of Cagayan for the 
construction of the Half-way house, the said balance is being utilized for the 
construction of the kitchen of the half-way house awaiting the utilization report. 



88 
 

Office Comments 
The amount of ₱4,050.17 shall be refunded by the Provincial Government of 
Isabela and is awaiting the check. 
 
The amount of ₱2,500,000.00 for 2016 BUB has been fully liquidated by the 
LGU of  Itbayat, Batanes,  taken-up in  JEV No. 01-2021-02-083-00 dated 
February 28, 2021. 
 

IV-A  As of June 30, 2021, the balance of Due from LGUs amounted to ₱8,001,114.92. 
There is continuous coordination with the LGUs concerned regarding the 
reconciliation of unexpended balance and demand letter was also sent for the 
unexpended balance to be returned/refunded to the BTr. 
 

VI As of June 30, 2021, the amount of ₱30,594,244.50 remained unliquidated.  
Demand letters have already been sent to LGUs requesting liquidation of or 
refund the outstanding amounts. 
 

VII As of June 30, 2021, the balance of Due from LGUs amounted to 
P417,406,182.26. Demand letters have already been sent to the concerned LGUs 
for them to liquidate or refund the unexpended balance. Also, there is continuous 
coordination with the concerned LGUs regarding the reconciliation of 
unexpended balance. 

X To continue reconciliation of unliquidated balances of LGUs, the ROs  sent 
follow-up demand letters requesting refund of unliquidated balances. 
 
Sent demand letters to Marawi City LCE to fast track completion or return of  
unspent funds or execute notarized Affidavit of Undertaking for the completion 
of the project. The Due from LGUs balance as of June 30, 2021, now only 
amounts to P78,409,792.27 as of December 31, 2020. 
 
The Salintubig Project in Region X includes the Water Supply Rehabilitation in 
seven (7) barangays in Marawi City. It was started in June 2018 and originally 
targeted to be completed by December 2019. However, the completion was 
delayed due to conflict in land ownership where the potential water source 
development including one of the water tanks will be located and issue on the 
road right of way where the pipes of water distribution will be in place. Although 
the LGU resolved the conflict and issues at a later time, the construction faced 
another delay when the COVID 19 pandemic affected the whole country from 
March 2020 onwards. The construction was suspended and resumed only in the 
later part of CY 2020. 
  
Based on the circumstances stated above, the completion date is revised to on or 
before the end of December 2021. Currently, the Project's physical 
accomplishment to date is 70 percent. The total allocation for the project is 
₱76M with fund amounting to ₱60.8M was released to LGU Marawi as 1st 
tranche and the remaining ₱15.2M to be released as 2nd tranche. As to date, the 
LGU was able to liquidate the amount of ₱15, 602,293.85. 



89 
 

Office Comments 
XI Management commented that they have already monitored and coordinated with 

LGUs consistently for implementation of the projects. The Regional Accountant 
commented also that they sent demand letters to all municipalities, cities and 
provinces to remind them of the MOA between DILG Region XI and LGUs and 
to constantly submit their Statement of Receipt and Disbursement for timely 
recording and updating of unliquidated balance.  Moreover, the PDMU Financial 
Analyst and the DILG Regional Accountant committed to visit the municipal 
and provincial accountants of LGUs for monitoring of unliquidated balance of 
locally funded projects. 
 
On the procurement of Emergency Transport Vehicle/Ambulance for the 
Province of Davao del Norte: 
 
On April 26, 2021, DILG XI  sent letter to the Prov. Governor of Davao del 
Norte requesting Status of Procurement of the Emergency Transport Vehicle 
(ETVs) amounting to ₱211,850,000.00. 
 
The region received a reply on May 5, 2021 and was provided with a copy of the 
Timeline of Activities from the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) for the 
procurement.  POs were already received by the Suppliers with delivery terms of 
120 to 180 calendar days (estimated on the 3rd quarter of this year). 
 
On July 8, 2021, another letter was received from the Province of Davao del 
Norte informing us that they were notified by their foreign suppliers that there 
would be delay in the delivery of the units on the ground that lockdowns were 
enforced in their country to minimize the spread of COVID-19 virus. 

NCR Status of Due from LGUs-RGAF funds was regularly reported to the Central 
Office - Project Management Office. The Regional Office as Source Agency 
(SA) and LGUs as Implementing Agency (IA) are only following the provisions 
indicated in DILG-MC 2019-161 on the release of funds upon compliance of 
documentary requirements such as submission of Physical and Financial Reports 
and a catch-up plan with a timeline of implementation on top of their 
Resettlement Action Plan to facilitate the completion of the delayed projects. 
Also, non-transfer of RGAF funds will be reflected on the Region’s utilization 
and deliverables. 

 
The amount was already adjusted per JEV# 20-09-15 and JEV # 20-12-0149. 

 
 

Non-preparation and submission of the required RPCI and RPCPPE and non-
maintenance of Property Cards 

 
6. Weakness on asset management was noted due to: a) non-preparation and 

submission of Report of Physical Count of Inventory (RPCI) of DILG Field 
Operating Units (FOUs) in Region 10 as required in Government Accounting 
Manual (GAM); b) ) non-preparation and submission of Report on the Physical 



90 
 

Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) of DILG Region IV-B 
contrary to  Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I; c) non-
updating of  Property Cards (PCs) in DILG NCR and Region III contrary to 
Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume 1 of the GAM for NGAS; and d) non-issuance of 
Property Acknowledgement Receipt for all issued PPEs in CAR. 
 

Non-preparation and submission of the required RPCI 
 

6.1 Section 13, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that: xxx 
Physical count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an indispensable 
procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship.  It also serves as 
an effective procedure of the government to secure its assets. 

 
6.2 Also, Instruction E, Appendix 66 of the GAM, Volume II requires that RPCI 

shall be submitted to the COA Auditor concerned not later than July 31 and 
January 31 of each year for the first and second semesters, respectively.  It 
shows the balance of inventory items per cards and per count and shortage and 
overage, if any. 

 
6.3 DILG field operating units in Region 10 did not prepare RPCI for inventories 

purchased and for the thermal scanners transferred to their jurisdiction.  
Moreover, the RPCI submitted by General Service Section did not include 
Drugs and Medicines for Distribution amounting to ₱4,487,991.12 and some 
expendable property related to Office and ICT Equipment. 

 
6.4 We recommended that Management require the concerned Inventory 

Committee (IC)/General Services Section (GSS) to prepare and submit 
RPCI to the Audit Team as required under Section 17, Chapter 8, Volume 
I of the GAM for NGAs. 

 
6.5 Management commented that the DILG FOUs (provincial and city offices) were 

not properly informed and guided as to compliance on RPCI submission.  The 
RO has yet to reiterate guidelines on the submission of RPCI for compliance by 
DILG FOUs.  Nevertheless, the Regional GSS will be closely coordinating with 
FOUs on their submission of RPCI as recommended by COA including 
consistency of ICS and PAR issuances.  With regard to non-inclusion of 
medicine and some office and ICT expendable items there is an ongoing 
reconciliation between GSS and Accounting Section (AS) to include certain 
items and reconcile unsettled amount of difference of the RPCI. 

      
     Non-submission of RPCPPE  

 
6.6 Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I provides, that the 

entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually 
and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and 
Equipment (RPCPPE) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted 



91 
 

to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. 
Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count 
shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/ 
recording. 

 
6.7 In Region IV-B, preparation of RPCPPE is still ongoing and was not submitted 

as to date.  
 

6.8 We recommended that the Regional Director require the Supply Officer to 
submit the Report of Physical Count of Property Plant Equipment for CY 
2020 and henceforth, strictly adhere to Section 38, Chapter 10 of 
Government Accounting Manual, Volume I on the timely submission of the 
report. 

 
6.9 Management reported that the Report of Physical Count of Property Plant 

Equipment (RCPPE) as of December 31, 2020 was already submitted on 
February 22, 2021. 

 
Non- updating of Property Cards 
 

6.10 Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume 1 of the GAM for NGAs states, that the Chief 
Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE including work 
and other animals, livestock etc. x x x. For check and balance, the Property and 
Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to 
account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be 
reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall 
also be reconciled with other property records like PAR. 

 
6.11 Contrary to above-cited provisions, Property Cards maintained by the Supply 

and General Service Section (SGSS) in the NCR were not updated for the year 
2018 to 2019. Similarly, the Property Cards (PCs) maintained by the Supply 
Unit in Region III were not updated due to voluminous workload while the 
preparation of PCs for PPEs in CAR is still on-going. 

 
6.12 We recommended that Management enforce the maintenance of updated 

Property Cards in compliance with the provisions of Section 42, Chapter 
10, Volume 1 of the GAM for NGAs, for check and balance.  

 

Incomplete Property Acknowledgment Receipts (PAR)  
 

6.13 Sec. 21, Chapter 10, Volume 1 of the GAM for NGAs provides that, the supply 
and/or Property Custodian shall prepare the Property Acknowledgement Report 
(PAR) to support the issue of property to end-user. The PAR shall be renewed at 
least every three years or every time there is a change in accountability or 
custodianship of the property. 

 



92 
 

6.14 In CAR, evaluation of PARs issued from CYs 2017-2020 revealed that these 
only cover accountabilities for some items recorded under ICT Equipment, 
Furniture and Fixtures and Motor Vehicles accounts.  Conversely, no PAR was 
issued for Office Equipment, Communication Equipment and the remaining 
PPE accounts. 

 
6.15 We recommended that Management require the Property Officer to 

prepare PAR for all PPE issuances to establish accountability and to 
comply with Section 21, Chapter 10, Volume 1 of the GAM. 

 
 
Granting of Daily Travel Expense to COS workers and use of Certification of Expenses 
not Requiring Receipts  

 
7. Contract of Service (COS) workers were allowed to reimburse Daily Travel 

Expense and use of Certification of Expenses not requiring Receipts instead of 
official receipts for taxi fares. 
 
7.1 Executive Order No. 77 dated 15 March 2019 prescribes the rules and 

regulations and rates of expenses and allowances for official local and foreign 
travels of government personnel.   

 

7.2 Section 2 thereof defines Daily Travel Expenses as amounts authorized to cover 
expenses for local travel, which consist of: (i) costs for hotel accommodation or 
lodging including prescribed taxes and service charges, (ii) meals, and (iii) 
incidental expenses, including cost for local or inland transportation and 
reasonable miscellaneous expenses at the place of assignment. 

 
7.3 In Central Office, the Travelling Expenses – Local account has a reported 

balance of ₱7,253,302.95 as of year-end of which the amount of P3,349,363.19 
or 46.17 percent thereof pertains to travel expenses incurred by COS workers 
which include Daily Travel Expenses of P645,340.00. 

 
7.4 COS workers were allowed to claim Daily Travel Expenses in relation to their 

authorized travel within the Philippines based on allowable travel rates for 
government personnel prescribed under EO No. 77 dated March 15, 2019.  
However, the same DTE could not be granted/applied to them because of the 
nature of their employment in the government as provided under Section 1 and 
2, Rule XI of CSC MC No. 40, s. 1998 and Section 7.5 of COA-DBM JC No. 2, 
s. 2020 

 
7.5 Instead, they should have been reimbursed fair and reasonable actual travel 

expenses upon presentation of bills and receipts and other necessary travel 
documents given that they are allowed to reimburse travelling expenses, in 
relation to their local travel as provided under Para. A. 4 of the Contract of 



93 
 

Service.     Hence, the legitimacy of DTE provided to COS workers as of 
December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱645,340.00 is questionable. 

 
7.6 Moreover, in Central Office the use of Certification of Expenses not Requiring 

Receipts in lieu of official receipts for expenses incurred amounting to ₱300.00 
or less as provided under COA Circular No. 2017-001 dated June 19, 2017 does 
not apply for taxi fares since taximeters are issuing receipts.  Taxis are among 
the exceptions of public utility vehicles issuing receipt as required by the Land 
Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). 

 
7.7 We recommended that Management: 

 
a. explain/justify why Daily Travel Expenses claimed by Contract of 

Service workers should be allowed in audit; and 
 
b. enforce presentation/submission of receipts for taxi fares amounting to 

₱300.00 or less, in compliance to COA Circular No. 2017-001 dated 
June 19, 2017. 

 
Management Comments 

 
7.8 Management explained that their basis for payment of DTE for COS personnel 

while performing official functions in the field was Department Circular (DC) 
2019-04 dated April 12, 2019 which was based on Executive Order No. 77. This 
Department Circular provides the internal policy on the payment of travel 
expenses for local and foreign travel for DILG LG Sector Officials and 
Personnel. 

 
7.9 Likewise, COS/JOs should be reimbursed fair and reasonable actual travel 

expenses upon presentation of bills and receipts and other necessary travel 
documents. The Management believes that adherence to the aforementioned 
circular which sets limits for TEV claims will be disadvantageous to the 
government considering increasing rates of hotel accommodation. 

 
7.10 It was also disclosed that a letter was already sent to COA Chairman Michael G. 

Aguinaldo on November 6, 2019 seeking guidance to enable the DILG to 
provide mobility support to COS personnel in the implementation of various 
Departments programs, activities and projects however, response to said letter is 
yet to be received by the DILG. 

 
7.11 On the enforcement of COA Circular 2017 – 001 relative to the presentation of 

receipts for taxi fares, Management commented that they are already 
considering item (a) of said COA Circular which according to them does not 
mentioned “taxi” as one of the utility vehicle issuing receipts in crafting of the 
agency’s internal guidelines. 
 



94 
 

 
 

Auditor' Rejoinder 
 

7.12 As mentioned by Management, reimbursement of fair and reasonable actual 
travel expenses for COS/JOs personnel shall only be made upon presentation of 
bills and receipts and other necessary travel documents. Audit disclosed that the 
practice in place where COS/JOs personnel were being reimbursed of travel 
expenses based on the rate prescribed and allowed to government personnel 
under Executive Order No. 77. Except for some receipts in public utility 
vehicles and air fares, no other ORs were attached to DVs for claim of 
reimbursement of concerned personnel that would support validity of said 
reimbursement. It is taken as if it is DTE which does not require receipts. The 
same being contrary to prevailing rules that every disbursement of government 
funds except for those expressly provided by law shall be supported by ORs. 
 

7.13 We reiterate our recommendation on the enforcement of the presentation/ 
submission of receipts for taxi fares amounting to P300.00 or less, in 
compliance to COA Circular No. 2017-001 dated June 19, 2017. Public utility 
vehicles mentioned in item (a) of said circular is not an exclusive list of PUV 
where receipts are required, what is necessary for one to be exempted from the 
provisions of said circular is that the PUV is issuing receipts. Thus, taxi 
although not mentioned therein, being a PUV which is mandated by other 
prevailing laws, rules and regulations to issue receipts are exempt from the 
provisions of said circular. Hence, required to present receipt for taxi fares. 

 
Reply to Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 
7.14 Management committed to revisit their internal guidelines on payment of 

travelling expenses and make the necessary adjustment/ correction to comply 
with COA’s recommendation, particularly on the taxi fare. 

 
 
Non-compliance with the requirements of COA Circular No. 95-011 

 
8. The DILG Central Office contracted and paid the services of two private 

lawyers in the total amount of ₱1,687,464.58 for Calendar Year 2020, without 
written conformity and acquiescence of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) 
and written concurrence of COA which is in direct violation of COA Circular 
No. 95-011 dated December 4, 1995 and OSG Memorandum dated December 15, 
2015.   
 
8.1 COA Circular No. 95-011 dated December 4, 1995 states: 

 
xxxxx public funds shall not be utilized for payment of the services of a private 
counsel or law firm to represent government agencies in court or to render 



95 
 

legal services for them.  In the event that such legal services cannot be 
avoided or is justified under extraordinary or exceptional circumstances, the 
written conformity and acquiescence of the Solicitor General or the 
Government Corporate Counsel, as the case maybe, and the written 
concurrence of the Commission on Audit shall first be secured before the 
hiring or employment of a private lawyer or law firm.” (emphasis provided) 

 
8.2 Moreover, OSG Memorandum dated December 15, 2015 on the Revised 

Guidelines on Deputation of Private Lawyers and Special Attorney which the 
agency used as reference for their request for COA’s written concurrence cited 
the above circular as follows: 
 
Meanwhile government agencies and instrumentalities may engage the services 
of private lawyers or a law firm only in exceptional cases.  In fact, Commission 
on Audit Circular No. 95-011, as amended by COA Circular No. 98-002, 
requires the prior written conformity and acquiescence of the Office of the 
Solicitor General and the written concurrence of COA before the hiring of 
private lawyers and law firms. 
 
Said OSG Memorandum further emphasized that requests for deputation should 
be sent to and received by OSG prior to effectivity of the contract period since 
retroactive deputation is not allowed. 
 

Non-compliance with the requirements of COA Circular No. 95-011 
 

8.3 In a letter dated July 31, 2020, DILG Secretary Eduardo M. Año requested for 
COA’s written concurrence in favor of 12 private lawyers (Annex B). These 
private lawyers will render services to the Department for the Bantay-
Korapsyon.  Said letter was emailed to COA Chairperson on August 25, 2020. 

 
8.4 Likewise, in an earlier letter dated February 13, 2020, Secretary Año also 

requested for written conformity and acquiescence of the OSG in favor of the 
same private lawyers. We noted that copy of said letter request was not stamped 
received by OSG. Rather, it contained a marking indicating that copy of the 
letter request was furnished to the Office of the COA Chairperson on March 6, 
2020 and COA Legal Services Sector and Office of the General Counsel on 
March 9, 2020. 

 
8.5 In CY 2020, DILG CO contracted and paid services of two private lawyers as 

legal counsel for the operation of Bantay Korapsyon. Details of their contracts 
are as follows:

8.6 Per audit, payments made to the two lawyers for their services in CY 2020 

amounted to ₱989,806.65 and ₱697,657.93, respectively, totaling 
₱1,687,464.58.  

 
8.7 Review of pertinent documents relative to agency’s compliance with 

requirements under COA Circular No. 95-011 dated December 4, 1995 and 
OSG Memorandum dated December 15, 2015, disclosed that the required OSG 
written conformity and acquiescence as well as COA written concurrence was 
not provided prior to hiring of subject private lawyers.  

 
8.8 Moreover, as previously mentioned in DILG letter dated February 13, 2020 

addressed to OSG on deputation of private lawyers who shall render services to 
the Department has no indication that it has been either received or stamped 
released by OSG record sections on February 24, 2020 the date after effectivity 
date of the contract of services (COS), contrary to the guidelines that request 
shall be sent to and received by OSG prior to effectivity of the contract. 

 
8.9 After evaluation of all available documents made by the Legal Services Sector 

of the Office of the General Counsel, we note that COA, in its 4th Indorsement 
dated January 28, 2021 denied the letter request of DILG for concurrence on 
hiring of private lawyers for non-compliance with mandatory requirements 
provided under COA Circular No. 95-011 dated December 4, 1995. 

 
8.10 As such, disbursements of public funds for payment of legal fees to private 

lawyers are in direct violation of COA Cir. No. 95-011 dated Dec. 4, 1995. 
 

8.11 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. in the absence of required written conformity and acquiescence of 
OSG and written concurrence of COA, provide necessary justification 
why payment of retainer’s fee to two private lawyers contracted to 
provide legal services for DILG’s Bantay-Korapsyon program should 
be allowed in audit; and 

 
b. moving forward, strictly comply to the provisions of  COA Circular 

No. 95-011 dated December 4, 1995 and OSG Memorandum dated 
December 15, 2015 on the hiring of private lawyers.

Management Comments 

 
8.12 The Department seeks exemption from the provisions requiring written 

conformity and acquiescence of the Solicitor General and the written 
concurrence of the Commission of Audit before the hiring or employment of 
private lawyer or firm.  Based on the memorandum issued by the Office of the 
Solicitor General dated December 15, 2015, it is particularly stated that “in the 
hiring of private lawyers to act as technical consultants for the government or 
client agency concerned, the perquisite prior written conformity of the Solicitor 
General need not be obtained.” 

 
8.13 That the services of the lawyers were not engaged for handling cases as such 

there is “No legal relationship nor hiring of a private counsel to represent 
government agencies in court or to render legal services for them.” 

 
8.14 The contract of the lawyers show that they only provide technical expertise and 

coordination with other national government agencies with regard to anti-graft 
and corruption policies. 

 
8.15 Moreover, the request for original deputation of Atty. Kristanetter Karyll B. 

Remigio as Bantay Korapsyon Legal Officer has been granted, under the letter 
of the Office of Solicitor General dated November 20, 2020 to the Secretary of 
DILG.  The validity covers the period February 13, 2020 to December 31, 2020, 
but is not authorized to appear on behalf of DILG in civil cases in lower courts 
and in administrative cases before quasi-judicial bodies for and on behalf of the 
DILG and its officials or employees. 

 
Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 
 

8.16 The Audit Team believes that the contracts of service of the hired private 
lawyers fall within the scope of the prohibition of COA Circular No. 95-011 
which covers the hiring of private legal counsel or law firm to represent 
government agencies in court or to render legal services for them.  This COA 
Circular amended/modified COA Circular No. 86-255, dated April 2, 1986, on 
same subject, where it directed that the payment out of public funds of retainer 
fees to private lawyers practitioners who are so hired or employed without the 
prior written conformity and acquiescence of the Solicitor General or the 
Government Corporate Counsel, as the case maybe, as well as the written 
concurrence of the Commission on Audit shall be disallowed in audit and the 
same shall be a personal liability of the official concerned. 
 

COA Circular No. 95-011 quoted the decision of the Supreme Court in the case 
of the Municipality of Pillila, Rizal vs. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. No. 
105909, promulgated on June 28, 1994, stating that, where a government 
agency is provided by law with a legal officer or office who or which can 



98 
 

handle its legal requirements or cases in courts, it (agency) may not be allowed 
to hire the services of private lawyers for a fee, chargeable against public funds, 
unless exceptional or extraordinary circumstances. 
 

In the case of DR. WENIFREDO T. OÑATE, Petitioner, v.  COMMISSION 
ON AUDIT, G.R. No. 213660, July 05, 2016, the Supreme Court declared that 
the prohibition under COA Circular No. 95-011 covers the hiring of private 
lawyers to render any form of legal service-whether or not the legal services to 
be performed involve an actual legal controversy or court litigation.  The 
purpose is to curtail the unauthorized and unnecessary disbursement of public 
funds to private lawyers for services rendered to the government, which is in 
line with the COA’s constitutional mandate to promulgate accounting and 
auditing rules and regulations, including those for the prevention and 
disallowance of irregular, unnecessary, extravagant or unconscionable 
expenditures or uses of government funds and properties. 
 

Likewise, the SC has invariably sustained the statutory authority of the OSG 
and the OGCC as well as the necessity of COA concurrence in the hiring of 
private lawyer by government agencies, and see no legal justification to deviate 
from the settled jurisprudence.  Indeed, when government entity engages the 
legal services of private counsel or law firm, it must do so with the necessary 
authorization required by law; otherwise, its official bind themselves to be 
personally liable for compensating such legal  services. 

 
 

 Deficiencies in the implementation of Infrastructure Project  
 

9. Fully finished 1-Storey DILG Albay Provincial Operations Office Building 
amounting to ₱4.6 million was not occupied and utilized since its completion in 
November 2018 due to gaps in project implementation such as absence of 
building and occupancy permits, variation between work accomplishment and 
As Built Plan and Program of Works and Construction Plan, absence of 
transformer and electricity lines, and building defects, among others. Further, 
repair works were not undertaken to correct the discovered defects in the 
building within the defects liability period nor the cost of the repair was claimed 
against the surety bond posted by the Contractor due to expiration of 
performance bond, contrary to Sections 39 and 62 and Annex E of the Revised 
IRR of RA No. 9184.  

 
Gaps in the implementation of infrastructure project 

 
9.1 The infrastructure project “DILG Albay Provincial Operations (PO) Office 1-

Storey Building” with contract amount of ₱4.6 million was certified as 
completed and turned-over to DILG ROV on November 26, 2018.  However, 
said project was inspected only on December 5, 2018 by the Technical 
Engineers of DILG ROV and Albay.  

 



99 
 

9.2 The said building was supposed to be occupied and utilized by Albay PO in 
early 2019 but Management discovered that the building was not constructed in 
accordance with the approved plans and specifications of the contract.  It was  
found that said building neither has the corresponding building and occupancy 
permits nor transformer and electricity line. 
 

9.3 Upon inspection by the DILG Office of the Project Development Services 
(OPDS) Engineers on March 27-29, 2019, it was discovered that there were 
several deficiencies and variations in the actual work accomplished as compared 
to the approved plans and specifications as summarized in the Memorandum of 
DILG USEC dated April 2, 2019. Some of the issues noted were as follows: 

 
a. Extension of validity of Performance security bond until Final 

Acceptance; 
b. An approved variation order should cover the replacement of work 

item: “Provision of Power Transformer” which was originally included 
in the proposed bill of quantities but was replaced in the final bill of 
quantities with the work item: “Construction of the Perimeter Fence” ; 

c. An approved variation order should also cover the removal of the work 
item: “Partition wall with door near the comfort room” which was 
initially included in the approved construction plan but this was not 
included in the statement of work accomplished; 

d. There was no approved Building Permit and Fire Safety Evaluation 
Certificate documents submitted; 

e. Installation of a steel gate at the rear side of the perimeter fence; 
f. Installation of a 200mm diameter culvert pipe connecting the catch 

basins; 
g. Repair of the PVC down spout and its reconnection to the catch basin; 
h. Repair of the observed defects on the panel door near the pantry is 

required; 
i.  Repair of the painting of beam located at the entry porch, the uneven 

painting of beam at the right side of the building and application of 
final paint coating at the upper portion of the building; 

j. Replacement of the hollow core flush door with panel doors located at 
Office Meeting Room, Pantry, PWD Cr and Utility Room; 

k. Reapplication of sealant to all the installed windows; 
l. Replacement of the fixed type windows into awning type; 
m. Rectify the observed cracks at the joint of the ceiling, concrete canopy 

at the back portion of the building, upper wall portion, and plant box;  
n. Construction of Stamp Pattern Cement Finished pathway as reflected 

in the As-Built Plan; 
o. Remove the observed rust and apply epoxy paint at the steel fence; and 
p. Install an electrical connection from the service entrance to the electric 

cooperative electrical post. 
 



100 
 

9.4 The above observations/requirements were not yet settled/complied with 
pending investigation reports from DILG Central Office, thus, subject office 
building was not occupied since the time it was completed in CY 2018 until 
January 2021.  

 
9.5 Relative thereto, Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) No. 2018-011 (18) 

dated October 15, 2018 was issued which require the submission of building 
permit for the construction of DILG Albay Office Building. On December 18, 
2018, a copy of the application for building permit, received by City 
Engineering Office on November 19, 2018, was provided to the Audit Team in 
partial compliance with the AOM. However, a follow up with the current 
PDMU Chief, disclosed that said application of building permit was pulled out 
from the City Engineering Office due to      incomplete documentary 
requirements. Until this time, no approved building permit was obtained from 
the City Engineering Office.  

 
9.6 The absence of required building permit not only failed to ensure that the 

project plan outlined is structurally secure and that the building codes and 
municipal by-laws were followed. Absence of a building permit prior to the 
construction of building may result to assessment of penalties, surcharges, and 
fines pursuant to Sections 212 and 213 of the Revised IRR of PD 1096. 

 
9.7 Furthermore, the inspection by the Audit Team of DILG Albay PO Office 

Building on November 18, 2020 disclosed that the building suffered further 
damages due to the passage of time as follows: 

 
a. The exterior (blue) paintings already fading; 
b. The left glass door at the entrance was shattered; 
c. The folding partition door to administration area was removed from its 

original position; 
d. The panel door at the roof deck was totally damaged and removed from 

the frame; and 
e. The roof deck slab with cracks. 

 
9.8 Meanwhile, the Agency has already paid the monthly cost of maintenance and 

security to the Bicol Regional Government Center Association, Inc. from 
February 2019 to November 2020 totaling ₱60,800.00.  The Agency is also 
paying for the salary of the security guard assigned at the area with daily rate of 
₱305.00 since December 2018. 
 

9.9 Discussion with the PDMU disclosed that they have already elevated the issues 
to the Secretary of DILG and are still awaiting SILG’s decision on their request 
for investigation and filing of appropriate charges against the concerned 
employees.  

 
 



101 
 

Repair works not undertaken to correct defects 
 

9.10 Section 39 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 provides that, to guarantee the 
faithful performance by the winning bidder of its obligations under the contract 
in accordance with the Bidding Documents, it shall post a performance security 
prior to the signing of the contract.  It further requires that the performance 
security shall remain valid until issuance by the Procuring Entity of the 
Certificate of Final Acceptance.  

 
9.11 Section 62.2 of the same Revised IRR provides the rules in relation to 

warranties for the procurement of Infrastructure Projects. It states, among 
others, the following pertinent provisions. 

 
9.12 Section 62.2.2. One year from project completion up to final acceptance or the 

defects liability period:  
  

62.2.2.1 The contractor shall undertake the repair works, at his own expense, 
of any damage to the infrastructure on account of the use of materials of 
inferior quality, within ninety (90) days from the time the HoPE has issued an 
order to undertake repair. In case of failure or refusal to comply with this 
mandate, the Procuring Entity shall undertake such repair works and shall be 
entitled to full reimbursement of expenses incurred therein upon demand. 

 
62.2.2.2 The defects liability period shall be covered by the Performance 
Security of the contractor required in Section 39.1 of this IRR, which shall 
guarantee that the contractor performs his responsibilities stated in the 
immediately preceding Section. If the contractor fails to comply with its 
obligations under Section 62.2.2.1 of this IRR, the Procuring Entity shall 
forfeit its performance security, subject its property(ies) to attachment or 
garnishment proceedings, and perpetually disqualify it from participating in 
any competitive bidding. All payables of the GoP in his favor shall be offset to 
recover the costs. 

 
9.13 Under Annex E of the Revised IRR, it prescribes that the total "retention 

money" shall be due for release upon final acceptance of the works. The 
contractor may, however, request substitution of the retention money for each 
progress billing with irrevocable standby letters of credit from a commercial 
bank, bank guarantees or surety bonds callable on demand, of amounts 
equivalent to the retention money substituted for and acceptable to Government, 
provided that the project is on schedule and is satisfactorily undertaken. 
Otherwise, the ten percent retention shall be made. Said irrevocable standby 
letters of credit, bank guarantees and/or surety bonds, to be posted in favor of 
the Government shall be valid for a duration to be determined by the concerned 
implementing office/agency or procuring entity and will answer for the purpose 
for which the ten percent retention is intended, i.e., to cover uncorrected 
discovered defects and third-party liabilities. 



102 
 

 
9.14 As discussed earlier, several deficiencies were noted during inspection of the 

building.    
 

9.15 On May 17, 2019, Management formally wrote a letter to the Contractor 
demanding the latter’s compliance with the obligations reached during their 
meeting on May 7, 2019.  The Contractor agreed to comply with the 
requirements pertinent to the documentary requirement aspect, particularly with 
regard to extension of performance security bond.  On the technical issues of the 
findings and observations, the Contractor stated that he shall cause the 
immediate implementation of necessary corrective actions in order to comply 
with the recommendations except for the provision of power transformer. 

 
9.16 Upon verification by Management on July 9, 2019, only the roof deck 

waterproofing was finished but noted that the waterproofing was superficial and 
already scaling.  A follow up letter dated July 24, 2019 was sent to the 
Contractor to which the latter replied that the project has been satisfactorily 
completed in accordance with plans and specifications of the contract and was 
pleasantly accepted by the Agency. 

 
9.17 It was noted that the Performance Bond had expired on June 18, 2019 but 

Management failed to secure the extension of the Performance Security contrary 
to Section 39.4 of the Revised IRR; hence, the faithful performance by the 
Contractor of the obligations under the contract was not guaranteed. Likewise, 
the Contractor’s obligations within the defects liability period (until November 
26, 2019 or one year after completion) under Sections 62.2.2.1 and 62.2.2.2 
could not be enforced.  

 
9.18 Had Management secured the extension of the Performance Bond until 

November 26, 2019, the necessary repair works could have been undertaken 90 
days after the HoPE has issued the letter on May 17, 2019, subject to 
reimbursement of expenses incurred from the Contractor upon demand under 
Section 62.2.2.1 and/or claimed it by forfeiting the performance security under 
Section 62.2.2.2.  

 
9.19 It was also noted that the Contractor posted a 10 percent surety bond on 

December 6, 2018 for the release of the 10 percent retention money that was 
valid until December 6, 2019. The repairs on the noted defects and variations 
could have also been undertaken and claimed against the Surety for the 
forfeiture of retention money prior to its expiration. 
 

9.20 While Management has initially taken actions to resolve deficiencies with the 
Contractor, there are no appropriate legal actions undertaken after the receipt of 
letter from the Contractor dated July 24, 2019 until the expiration of 
performance bond and retention money.   

 



103 
 

Warranty Security not required 
 

9.21 Section 62.2.3 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 states that: From final 
acceptance of the project up to the prescribed period in Section 62.2.3.2 of this 
IRR.  

 
62.2.3.1 The following shall be held responsible for “Structural Defects,” i.e., 
major faults/flaws/deficiencies in one or more key structural elements of the 
project which may lead to structural failure of the completed elements or 
structure, or “Structural Failures,” i.e., where one or more key structural 
elements in an infrastructure facility fails or collapses, thereby rendering the 
facility or part thereof incapable of withstanding the design loads, and/or 
endangering the safety of the users or the general public: 
 
a) Contractor – Where Structural Defects/Failures arise due to faults 
attributable to improper construction, use of inferior quality/substandard 
materials, and any violation of the contract plans and specifications, the 
contractor shall be held liable; 
 b) xx 
 c) xx 
 d) xx 
 e) xx 
 
62.2.3.2 xx 
 
62.2.3.3 requires the posting of warranty security to guarantee that the 
contractor shall perform his responsibilities as prescribed in Section 
62.2.3.1(a). 

 
9.22 A review of the final payment of the contract cost on December 17, 2018, it was 

noted that Warranty Security was not required from the Contractor contrary to 
Section 62.2.3.3 of the Revised IRR; hence, the Contractor could not be held 
liable in case of Structural Defects/Failures that may be discovered within the 
warranty period per Section 62.2.3.1(a) of the IRR of RA 9184.  

 
9.23 The warranty security should be required before the lapse of defects liability 

period for the release of Certificate of Final Acceptance. There was no 
Certificate of Final Acceptance yet issued to the Contractor upon the lapse of 
defects liability period due to the uncorrected deficiencies. 

 
9.24 We recommended that Management:  

 
a. facilitate the obtention of necessary permits for the project and any 

penalties and fines that may be imposed for failing to obtain the same 
shall be the account of the responsible personnel; 

 



104 
 

b. undertake necessary repair of the DILG Albay Provincial Operations 
(PO) office building to make it operational and make a representation 
with service provider for the installation of electrical transformer;  

 
c. evaluate the performance of the concerned Contractor using NEDA 

approved Contractor’s Performance Evaluation System (CPES) 
guidelines for the type of project implemented and submit the same to 
the Construction Industry Authority of the Philippines.  Thereafter, 
consider the blacklisting procedure, if warranted, based on the results 
of the performance evaluation; 

 
d. pursue legal action against the Contractor for failure to perform his 

contractual obligation; and  
 

e. ensure that pertinent provisions of RA 9184 are enforced in the 
implementation of project to protect the interest of the government. 

 
Management Comments 

 
9.25 The subject infrastructure project was implemented in CY 2018 during the 

leadership of the former Regional Director, headed by the former PDMU Chief, 
who allowed the construction without building permit;  

 
9.26 They noted the defects and irregularities on the construction of the office 

building as well as the absence of building permit and power transformer and 
electricity line. Hence, Management had several discussions with the Contractor 
to settle said defects until the latter became unresponsive.  Management also 
pursued the installation of transformer with the Contractor but the latter 
disputed that it was not part of the contract.  The provision of the power 
transformer was included in the Contractor’s proposal but was replaced with the 
construction of the Perimeter Fence in the final bill of quantities.   

 
9.27 They already elevated the noted defects and irregularities on the construction of 

DILG Albay PO office building to the DILG Central Office Legal Services, 
which was supposed to be investigated in CY 2020. However, said investigation 
was postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, repairs could not be 
undertaken pending the said investigation. 

 
9.28 In compliance with the recommendation, Management had undertaken repairs 

pertaining only to the security of the office building so that the DILG Albay PO 
personnel can transfer to the new building in January 2021.  While the 
transformer was already procured in June 2020 and installed in November 2020.  

 
9.29 They are already securing the lacking necessary requirements for the application 

of the building and occupancy permit. 
 



105 
 

9.30 The repairs were not undertaken since the construction of subject building had 
several issues and requested its investigation to DILG Central Office. 
Management also commented that they had discussions with the Contractor 
where the latter agreed to extend the performance security, but failed to do so.  
As to the blacklisting procedure, Management awaits investigation reports and 
findings by the DILG Investigation Committee. 

 
9.31 The final payment and retention money was immediately released to the 

contractor during the period of the Former Regional Director, which was prior 
to the lapse of defects liability period. Management also commented that the 
Contractor was already unresponsive to their communication and had reported 
the issues related to the construction of DILG Albay PO office building to the 
DILG legal services for investigation and appropriate action. 

 
 
Delayed/Non- Submission of Reports  

 
10. Management was not able to submit mandatory accounting/financial reports, 

contracts and POs and other reports within the period prescribed under existing 
accounting and auditing rules and regulations; thereby affecting timely review 
and verification of the same reports. 

 
10.1 Pursuant to Section 122 (1) of PD 1445, whenever deemed necessary in the 

exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it 
require the agency heads, chief accountants, xxx  to submit trial balances, xxx,  
and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions.” 

 
10.2 Hereunder is the list of delayed/unsubmitted reports and the reasons for the 

delay/non-submission: 
 

Office Delayed/Unsubmitted Reports Reasons for delay/ non-submission 
NCR Copies of Contracts and 

Purchase Orders (POs)   
2 Copies of Contracts, POs, 

Memorandum of Agreements 
and supporting documents  

3 Monthly Report of Official 
Travels and Fuel Consumption, 
Purchase Orders, Notice of 
Deliveries and Bank 
Reconciliation Statements  
(BRS) 

Delay in preparation of Monthly Report of 
Fuel Consumption and Monthly Report of 
Official Travel due to retirement and 
resignation of the employee in charge of said 
reports in January 2020.  In as much as they 
tried to cope up with the demands of work, 
the Work-from-Home arrangement in view 
of the COVID 19 pandemic, greatly affected 
the preparation of reports while non-
submission of POs and Notice of Deliveries 
was due to voluminous works and lack of 
personnel. 



106 
 

Office Delayed/Unsubmitted Reports Reasons for delay/ non-submission 
 
BRS were not prepared and submitted on a 
timely basis. 
 

4A Contracts and Purchase Orders Due to COVID-19 Pandemic, submission of 
POs/Contracts to COA was delayed. 

5 Contracts, Purchase Orders and 
Disbursement Vouchers 

Delay in submission of DVs and its 
supporting documents is due to restrictions 
on physical work reporting and traveling 
caused by COVID-19 pandemic, as well as, 
additional administrative works for the 
contact tracers. Further, vouchers and 
supporting documents were scanned for the 
maintenance of digital copies. 

6 Financial Reports, Purchase 
Orders, Other Contracts, 
Disbursements Vouchers, BRS 

Delay in submission of reports, POs and 
Other Contract and DVs to Office of the 
Auditor is attributed to voluminous 
transactions of the Office.  In addition, due to 
Covid-19 pandemic office operations/ 
activities were limited and restricted.  Also, 
field offices’ delayed submission of reports 
and documents and lacking supporting 
documents necessary for the preparation of 
vouchers and liquidations, also contributed to  
late submission of vouchers to the Auditor. 
 
The Accountant explained that she was not 
able to promptly prepare the BRS because of 
the COVID 19 pandemic 
limitations/restrictions implemented and 
voluminous work load in the Accounting 
Section. 
 

9 Financial Reports were not 
submitted within the 
reglementary period 
 
BRS 

Major causes on delayed submissions on CY 
2020 as provided by Management was the 
adoption of AWA due to public health 
emergency all through-out the country. After 
ECQ was lifted in Region 9, Management 
returned to work status but on skeleton work 
force (SWF) and was on lock down last 
September 7-11, 2020. 
 
 

11 BRS Supporting documents like bank statements 
which are vital in the analysis of bank 
balances were not submitted. 
 

12 Disbursement Vouchers, Report 
of Checks Issued, Report of 

Common reasons of field offices for the 
delay and non-submission of reports were 



107 
 

Office Delayed/Unsubmitted Reports Reasons for delay/ non-submission 
ADA Issued, Copies of 
Contracts and Purchase Orders, 
Bank Reconciliation Statements 

due to the tasks involving contact tracers and 
failure of person/s responsible timely 
preparation of reports and supporting 
documents, which should be attached to 
DVs.  It should be noted that the Contact 
Tracing Program started only in the second 
week of October 2020 and while there was 
an abnormal situation brought about by 
COVID-19 pandemic, government 
transactions did not stop. Hence, there is no 
worthy reason why reports were delayed or 
not submitted at all. 

 
10.3 Failure to submit required reports on time hindered the Audit Team from 

conducting timely review and evaluation of financial transactions with the end 
view of generating timely and relevant audit results. 

 
10.4 Further, Section 122 of PD No. 1445 provides that failure on the part of officials 

concerned to submit documents and reports xxx shall automatically cause the 
suspension of payment of salaries until they shall have complied with the 
requirements of the Commission. 

 
10.5 We recommended that Management require the concerned Accountant to 

observe prescribed deadlines in the submission of mandatory 
accounting/financial reports, contracts and POs and other reports to COA 
within the prescribed period. 

 
10.6 Management provided the following comments: 

 
Office Comments 
NCR Management is now regularly submitting copies of purchase orders and 

contracts to COA. Delay in the submission of POs and contracts in 2020 
was due to the WFH arrangements during the pandemic, especially on ECQ 
and MECQ. 
 

2 Management commented that they established a system of tracking and 
furnishing Auditor’s Office copies of approved Contacts, POs and Job 
Orders (JOs) within five working days from execution and notifying within 
24 hours from acceptance of deliveries of procured items starting 4th 
quarter of year 2020. 

3 Management commented that the GSS was not able to comply on time the 
submission of perfected contracts/POs and notices of deliveries due to WFH 
arrangement starting March 18 to December 31, 2020 brought about by 
COVID 19 pandemic.  Personnel in charge in the preparation and 
submission of said documents work under AWA wherein the intermittent 
physical reporting to work of the GSS staff resulted in the neglect to comply 
with the required documents.  However, they assured the Audit Team that 
they will adhere to the recommendations especially now that Management 



108 
 

Office Comments 
issued a Division Memorandum dated January 4, 2021 requiring SWF in 
each Office from Monday to Thursday.  Moreover, delay in the preparation 
of Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption and Monthly Report of Official 
Travel due to the retirement and resignation of the employee in charge of 
the said reports in January 2020.   

4A Management promised to submit the POs/Contracts immediately upon 
execution.  They contended that due to COVID-19 Pandemic, submission of 
the POs/Contracts to the COA was delayed. 

5 Management issued a Memorandum to the Regional Accountant and 
Provincial Offices to submit prior year DVs with complete supporting 
documents and covering reports not later than February 28, 2021 and to 
submit current year reports and DVs within 10 days of the ensuing month 
reports. 
 
Management had instructed the Chief Administrative Officer to require the 
Supply Officer and BAC to submit a copy of POs and Contracts, together 
with procurement documents, within five days from issuance of PO or 
execution of the contract.  Chief Administrative Officer also commented 
that they have implemented a monitoring system as to the submission of 
approved PO and contracts within the prescribed period. 

6 Management commented that the Office’s financial transactions were 
reduced to more than 50 percent this year in comparison to previous years, 
however despite this significant reduction, there are still challenges in the 
submission of these reports. Due to unfavorable observations noted, they 
exerted utmost effort to submit the reports on time in the first two months of 
2021.  
  
However, for reasons beyond their control, physical reporting to Office 
prevented them due to quarantine protocols. Further, periodic lockdowns for 
decontamination were conducted several times in RO. These inevitable 
situations brought about by the pandemic hindered them to promptly gather 
DV from the Supply and/or Cash Section. 
 
During the last quarter of 2020, the Accounting and Cash sections was 
urgently busy in the preparation of salaries and claims of more than 3,000 
Contact Tracers in the region. Management commented that a memorandum 
will be issued to concerned personnel and DILG field offices for submission 
of POs within the prescribed period. 

9 Management explained that it is their goal to submit a complete Financial 
Reports on the 10th day after the end of the month.  They have tried 
different strategies to catch up with the requirement but to no avail and this 
worsened during the declaration of health emergency and lockdowns.  To 
facilitate reporting of transactions, Management relied on the reports 
generated online via Google drive from field offices, which was not 
completed on time.   

12 Management will issue an advisory or memorandum requiring field offices 
to submit required reports and documents together with its attachments 
within the reglementary period and closely and periodically monitor 
compliance.

11. Out of the ₱658,716,722.00 funds allocated for the 20 locally funded projects, 

only ₱454,344,216.87 was obligated resulting in unutilized allotment of 
₱204,372,505.13. Likewise, programmed/planned activities were partially or not 
implemented in view of low fund utilization rate ranging from zero to 72.56 
percent.  

 
11.1 Section 60 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA provides that, all 

appropriations authorized in this Act, including budgetary support to GOCCs, 
shall be available for release and disbursement for the purpose specified, and 
under the same general and special provisions applicable thereto, until 
December 31, 2020. It further provides that after the end of the validity period, 
all unreleased appropriations shall lapse, while unexpended and undisbursed 
funds shall revert to the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund in 
accordance with Section 28, Chapter 4, Book VI of EO No. 292 and shall not 
thereafter be available for expenditure except by subsequent legislative 
enactment. 

 
11.2 Further, DBM Circular No. 2011-15 dated December 26, 2011 provides the 

following: 
  

2.0 xxx.  Agencies shall ensure optimum utilization of their available NCA 
releases within the schedules program/project/activity implementation period 
as reflected in their submitted Monthly Cash Program. 

 
11.3 DILG is mandated to assist the President in the exercise of general supervision 

over local governments in promoting local autonomy, encouraging community 
empowerment and maintaining peace and order and safety. Further, it provides 
training, technical assistance, develops materials and implements various 
infrastructure development programs and projects in support to the capability 
building efforts of the Local Government Units (LGUs). 

 
11.4 In order to carry out its mandate and achieve its organizational outcome, DILG 

was provided with appropriations in the total amount of ₱8,707,905,281.74 in 
CY 2020, consisting of current and prior year’s appropriations of 
₱7,716,415,588.00 and ₱991,489,693.74, respectively.  It was adjusted to

11.12 It can be seen in the above table that out of the total allotments received by 

DILG in the amount of P658.717 million, only P454.344 million or 68.97 
percent was obligated leaving a balance of P204.373 million.  Moreover, 
analysis of fund utilization based on total disbursements over total allotments 
showed that said projects had low fund utilization of below 75 percent ranging 
from zero to 72.56 percent. 

 
11.13 Moreover, the zero disbursement rate for Barangay Tanod Skills Enhancement 

and Advocacy and Capacity Building for Local Institutions on Women and 
Children; and the very low disbursement rate of 4.14 and 9.23 percent, for    
ASEAN Cross-Sectoral Collaborating Meeting for the Final Review Back to 
Back with the Ways forward of “Bohol TIP work Plan 2017-2020” and 
Executive Information System, respectively, raises doubts on the validity of the 
obligations made for these projects.  Pursuant to Section 2(j), Chapter 3 of the 
GAM, Volume 1, “Obligation” is an act of a duly authorized official which 
binds the government to the immediate or eventual payment of a sum of 
money. As per Section 11 of same Chapter, incurrence of obligations shall be 



114 
 

made through issuance of Obligation Request and Status (ORS) which shall be 
prepared by Requesting/Originating Office supported by valid documents like 
DVs, payrolls, purchase/job orders, itinerary of travel, etc.     

 
11.14 Thus, if the obligation of allotment was based on valid documents, payment 

thereof will eventually/immediately follow. 
 

11.15 Review of submitted accomplishment report as at year-end by the Planning 
Service disclosed that there are programmed activities on these projects that 
were either partially or not implemented which contributed to the low 
utilization of funds.   Activities that were not implemented during the year are 
presented in Annex A and cited reasons are as follows: 

 
a. decision of top management to discontinue all activities that will 

involve gathering of people in a crowd regardless of size such as 
meetings, workshops, seminars and other related events in order to 
prevent the spread of COVID 19; 

b. postponement/cancellation of activities to address other programs 
related to COVID 19 situation: 

c. reduction of funds for the programed activities; and 
d. activities that were cancelled due to travel restrictions. 

 
11.16 While we understand that accomplishments of government agencies were 

affected by this pandemic, however, the low fund utilization rate not only 
showed DILG’s limited capability to implement its projects but it also delayed 
project implementation which will redound to the disadvantage of the public. 

 
11.17 We recommended that Management: 

 
a. improve its absorptive capacity through timely implementation of 

programs and activities to avoid expiration of allotments and lapsing 
of cash allocations; and  

 
b. require officials concerned to monitor utilization of project funds and 

see to it that programmed activities are implemented in due time. 
 

11.18 Management cited that DILG-OSEC has an overall budget utilization rate of 
91.18 percent (FY 2020 and FY 2019 Continuing Appropriations) which is 
acceptable considering the declaration of the emergency health crises in the 
country pursuant to Proclamation No. 929 dated March 16, 2020, and the 
subsequent issuance of RA 11469 and RA 11494. 
 

Further, majority of the targeted activities have been accomplished through the 
utilization of the available online platform as one of the implementing 
strategies. 
 



115 
 

The main reason for the low utilization of FY 2020 twenty (20) locally Funded 
Projects, was due to delays in the implementation of 
Program/Activities/Projects caused by the adjustments while adopting the 
IATF set of restrictions/limitations specifically on conducting face-to-face 
activities, audit, monitoring and inspections of project in the field.  Though 
there are also specific reasons which were already mentioned in the reported 
operational highlights of the agency which contributed to none implementation 
of the required activities to deliver the requirements of the projects. 
 

To address the recommendation to improve the absorptive capacity through 
timely implementation of programs and activities to avoid the expiration of 
allotments and lapsing of cash allocations, management claim that a 
memorandum is regularly issued to concerned officials/PMOs indicating the 
monthly utilization of funds to facilitate the implementation of their respective 
projects. 

 
 
Project Evaluation 

 
Philippine Anti-Drugs Strategy 
 
12. Utilization of funds allocated for Philippine Anti-Illegal Drugs Strategy (PADS) 

amounting to ₱49,558,884.00 was not maximized as ₱21,339,940.75 or 43.06 
percent thereof was not utilized caused by either non-implementation or partial 
implementation of activities because of the restrictions imposed by COVID 19 
pandemic.   
 
12.1 EO No. 66 dated October 29, 2018 institutionalized the PADS in all 

government offices, departments, bureaus, agencies and offices, including 
government owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) and state universities 
and colleges (SUCs).  

 
12.2 In DILG, PADS-PMO is the office tasked to spearhead the Department’s 

various initiatives towards drug free communities. The program focuses on 
policy development, capacity building and monitoring and evaluation of Anti-
Drug Abuse Councils that lead LGUs in Planning and implementation of Anti-
illegal drug activities.  

 
12.3 For CY 2020, DILG had an authorized appropriation of ₱110,000,000.00 under 

the GAA for its project on PADS wherein it received an allotment of 
₱49,558,884.00 for the implementation of the following activities:

Amendment were both in the finalization stages. 
 

12.6 As regards Strengthening of Barangay Anti-Drug Abuse Councils (BADACs), 
although the target of developing advocacy materials which includes audio 
visual presentations and a guidebook for online module were completed, said 
activity was partially accomplished as the target on policy development, online 
learning modules, and evaluation of conducted project were not accomplished/ 
delivered. 

 
12.7 The conduct of 2019 Anti-Drug Abused Council (ADAC) Performance Audit 

which was postponed due to health protocols imposed by the COVID-19 
pandemic,  targeted/planned to have 1,715 LGUs for audit, 40 LGUs to be 
visited for onsite monitoring and evaluation, 1,715 LGUs Calibrated by ADAC 
National Audit Team and 2019 ADAC Performance Audit Award. PMO 
instead conducted regional profiling to measure LGU’s implementation of anti-
illegal drug program and activities.  

 
12.8 Based on the Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, 

Disbursements and Balances (SAAODB) for CY 2020 from the 
₱49,558,884.00 allotment received for the implementation of PADS, 56.94 and 
37.43 percent were obligated and disbursed, respectively, as at year-end,   
indicating low fund utilization. The details of which are as follows:

12.9 As shown, only the allotment allocated for Communication Expense was 

obligated in full with 57.08 disbursements.  Obligation rates for Other MOOE, 
Supplies and Materials, Training Expenses and Other Professional Services 
ranged from 7.45 to 51.37 percent, while disbursement rate ranged from zero 
percent to 38.42 percent.  Out of total allotments for these four expenses, 
₱9,198,724.18 or 42.92 percent were obligated and only ₱1,059,581.71 or 4.94 
percent were disbursed which could be considered very low utilization rate.  
Moreover, it was noted that funds transferred/downloaded to ROs remained not 
utilized during the year. 

 



119 
 

12.10 The foregoing conditions showed that DILG was not able to maximize 
utilization of allotment provided for PADS which resulted in delayed program/ 
project implementation to the disadvantage of the intended beneficiaries.  

 
12.11 We recommended that Management: 

 
a. maximize the utilization of allotments through proper planning and 

timely implementation of projects/activities during the year; and  
 

b. fast track the: (i) procurement process and ensure that all 
procurement activities are within the time frame to implement the 
programs and activities; and (ii) full-implementation of the remaining 
uncompleted activities. 

 
Management Comments 

 
12.12 Management commented that after the PMO realigned its OPB for FY 2020, it 

should have ₱38,070,224.04 remaining funds after the amount of 
₱11,488,659.96 was intended to be declared as additional savings for the 
implementation of RA 11469 (Bayanihan to Heal as One Act). Thus, 
considering the realignment, the PADS PMO should have a higher utilization 
rate of at least 73 percent.  

 
12.13 Management likewise provided detailed explanation/justification for activities 

not implemented and ongoing/partially implemented status. In total PADS 
PMO encountered various challenges brought by the COVID 19 – Pandemic 
which makes it hard to fully implement the planned activities. Nonetheless, the 
Management provided actions to be taken and future plans to fully realize the 
entirety of the planned activities of the program. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 
12.14 The amount of ₱49,558,884.00 which is the basis of our computation of 

utilization rate for PADS was verified and supported by legal documents such 
as the Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements 
and Balances (SAAODB) for CY 2020. Likewise, said amount and utilization 
rate was embodied in the accomplishment report of the PADS itself which was 
prepared by the DILG and submitted to our office. It is necessary for PADS 
PMO to coordinate with concerned offices to reconcile its record to have 
accurate figures that would tally with other valid documents. Nonetheless, the 
Audit Team recognized the effort of the PMO to address the issue and 
provision of detailed actions and plan to achieve the objectives of the program.

Manila Bay Clean-Up 
 

13. DILG accomplished only 63.64 percent of the 22 planned targets/activities and 
incurred obligation of P27,525,614.07 or 72.56 percent of the ₱37,935,414.00 
total allotments received for the Manila Clean-Up project, resulting in 
unobligated allotment of ₱10,409,799.93 for unimplemented planned targets. 

 
13.1 A Supreme Court (SC) EN BANC Decision dated December 18, 2008 states 

that the DILG in exercising the President’s power of general supervision and 
its duty to promulgate guidelines in establishing waste management programs 
under Section 43 of the Philippine Environment Code shall direct all LGUs in 
Metro Manila, Rizal, Laguna, Cavite, Bulacan, Pampanga and Bataan to 
inspect all factories, commercial establishments and private homes along banks 
of the river systems and waterways that eventually discharge water into the 
Manila Bay. 

 
13.2 In line with this SC En Banc Decision, DILG issued Memorandum dated June 

2, 2008 directing above-cited LGUs to immediately inspect all factories and 
establishments along the banks of river systems that eventually discharge water 
into the Manila Bay and require non-complying establishments and homes to 
set up facilities to prevent wastes from flowing into these rivers. 

 
1.33 Moreover, DILG  issued MC No. 2018-2017 dated December 4, 2018 and MC 

No. 2020-112 dated August 26, 2020 containing the following implementation 
guidelines: 

 
DILG MC No. 2018-2017 dated December 4, 2018  
 
It provides the guidelines on Manila Bay Clean-Up, Rehabilitation and 
Preservation Program’s LGU Compliance Assessment. It further provides that 
the LGU Compliance Assessment focuses on four categories namely: (i) 
Liquid Waste Management, (ii) Solid Waste Management, (iii) Informal Settler 
Families and (iv) Information Education Communication and Institutional 
Arrangements. 
 
 DILG MC No. 2020-112 dated August 26, 2020  
 
It prescribes guidelines on the MANILA BAYani Awards and Incentives. The 
MANILA BAYani Awards and Incentives was introduced to encourage LGUs 
included in the Manila Bay Area to comply with pertinent environmental laws 
that support the rehabilitation of the bay. 

 
13.3 For Calendar Year 2020, the DILG received a total allotment of 

₱37,935,414.00 for the Manila Bay Clean-Up project, of which, 
₱22,967,882.00 was sub-allotted to DILG ROs and ₱14,967,532.00 for the 
Central Office expenses. Out of the total allotment, ₱27,525,614.07 or 72.56

Management Comments 

 
13.8 The Department clarifies that when it comes to the implementation of the 

Manila Bayani Awards and Incentives (MBAI), the MBCRPP Program 
Management Office (PMO) has achieved its physical accomplishment, 
validating the five (5) LGUs endorsed for the MBAI. If considering the 
obligation of the ₱5,000,000 funding, the budget utilization rate of the Program 
is at 85 percent, with CO utilization rate increase from 41.44 percent to 74.85 
percent. 
 
Output: No. of LGUs monitored on compliance to the SC Mandamus 
Accomplishment: 94/178 (52.81 percent) 

 
Clarification on the Accomplishment: 178/178 LGUs (100 percent) 

  
13.9 This Department clarifies that all 178 LGUs (100 percent) in the Manila Bay 

Watershed Area have been monitored in terms of their compliance to the 
Supreme Court (SC) continuing Mandamus, and to environmental laws and 
policies that support the rehabilitation of Manila Bay, through the following 
initiatives: 

  
2020 LGU Compliance Assessment (LGU CA) 

13.10 Pursuant to DILG Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2018-2017 and 2020-143, 
the LGU CA shall be conducted annually, to assess and validate the status of 
LGUs’ performance to its mandates under the Program. 
 

13.11 Activities in relation to the LGU CA conducted in 2020 were the levelling-off 
meeting to present results of the Regional Assessments in March 2020, series 
of consultation meetings with the National Interagency Committee in August 
2020, and the conduct of the National Validation in September 2020. 

 
Quarterly Monitoring of LGU Compliance 

13.12 Since the creation of the Program, the PMO collects quarterly data from LGUs, 
through the Manila Bayanihan-Data Capture Forms, that provides information 
on the status of LGUs’ performance based on indicators and parameters set by 
the Program to objectively measure such. 



124 
 

 
13.13 Due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in the 1st Quarter of 2020, 

submission of quarterly reports has been postponed allowing LGUs to focus 
their efforts and resources on the emergency response. Memorandum dated 
October 1, 2020, with subject: Resumption of the Submission of MBCRPP 
Quarterly Reports directs LGUs, though the Regional Offices, to submit their 
reports starting 3rd Quarter 2020, hence, the MBCRPP was able to monitor all 
178 LGUs on their quarterly compliance.  

 
Output: No. of LGUs assisted on the formulation of the 10-Year Solid Waste 
Management Plan 
Accomplishment: 0/17 

 
Clarification on the Physical Accomplishment: 17/17 LGUs (100%) 

  
13.14 The physical accomplishment was not reflected in the OPB since funding for 

the said activity was re-aligned for another purpose. This is to clarify that the 
MBCRPP, through the Program Management Team (PMT) of Region III has 
conducted an online coaching session to the targeted 17 LGUs on November 5, 
2020. 

  
Output: No. of LGUs assisted on the formulation of Septage and Sewerage 
Management Ordinance (SSMO) 
Accomplishment: 0/12 

13.15 As of 2nd Quarter of 2021, the targeted 12 LGUs in Region IV-A have 
successfully formulated its SSMO, hence subject activity is no longer 
necessary. 

  
Output: No. of LGUs conducted Environmental Compliance Audit (ECA) for 
Barangays 
Accomplishment: 0/94 

13.16 The Environmental Compliance Audit for Barangays is a new initiative for 
supposed pilot-testing in 2020, in light of the thrust of the Program to focus its 
effort on barangay solid waste management. As of 2nd Quarter of 2021, 
indicators and procedures of the audit have been developed, subject for final 
comments and inputs of partner government agencies. The roll-out of the 
activity is targeted on the 4th quarter of this year. 

  
Output: No. of LGUs oriented on drafting, updating and implementation of 
Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) and Coastal Resource Management 
(CRM) 
Accomplishment: 0/97 

  
13.17 Aside from the stringent health protocols which resulted in the cancellation of 

the subject activity, the MBCRPP is also implementing the Fisheries 



125 
 

Compliance Audit (FishCA), to which the PMO is of view that objectives of 
the two (2) activities may be merged. 

  
13.18 The Department clarifies that for ICM and CRM, as well as for the FishCA, the 

Program only targets the coastal LGUs, a total of 34. As of 2nd Quarter of 
2021, the MBCRPP has conducted its orientation on the FishCA, hence 
orienting and providing the necessary information to the 34 coastal LGUs. The 
Program Management Team of NCR has conducted its online orientation last 
November 2020. 

   
Output: No. of Manila BAYani National Top Performers provided with cash 
incentives 
Accomplishment: 0/5 
Clarification on the Physical Accomplishment: 5/5 LGUs (100%) 

  
13.19 The physical accomplishment was not reflected due to the experienced delay in 

the downloading of said fund for cash incentives, as stated above. The 
Department wishes to clarify that the cash incentives has been duly provided to 
the LGUs on the 1st Quarter of 2021. 

  
Output: No. of ECA National Top Performers provided with cash incentives 
Accomplishment: 0/5 
Clarification on the Physical Accomplishment: N/A 

 
13.20 Since CY 2020, the National Environmental Compliance Audit (ECA) is 

officially renamed as the Manila BAYani Awards and Incentives, which 
expands the coverage of the Audit to include indicators on the categories of 
Liquid Waste Management, Management of Informal Settler Families, 
Information, Education, and Communication Strategies, and Institutional 
Arrangements/ Mechanisms. 

  
13.21 This Department clarifies that the MBCRPP only has two (2) awards and 

incentives at the National Level, which is for the MBAI, and the Fisheries 
Compliance Audit (FishCA).  

 
 

Communicating for Perpetual End to Extreme Violence and Forming Alliance 
Towards Positive Change and Enriched Communities (C4PEACE) 

 
14. Management was not able to fully utilize the ₱85,440,000.00 allotment received 

during the year for the Communicating for Perpetual End to Extreme Violence 
and Forming Alliance Towards Positive Change and Enriched Communities 
project resulting in unobligated allotment of ₱8,735,374.94 or 10.22 percent of 
the allotments due to non-implementation of five targeted activities  under 
“Strengthened communication strategies, capacity development and alliance-
building with all sector for local peace and development” and partial 



126 
 

implementation of one activity under the “Program Oversight”. Thus, the 
required outputs were not carried out/attained during the year 

 
14.1 EO No. 70 dated December 4, 2018 was issued to institutionalize whole-of-

nation approach in attaining inclusive and sustainable peace, create a national 
task force to end local communist armed conflict and direct the adoption of a 
national peace framework. Under this Order, the Secretary of the DILG was 
appointed as member of National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed 
Conflict (NTFELCAC). 

 
14.2 As the lead agency tasked to localize EO 70, the DILG through the 

Communicating for Perpetual End for Extreme Violence and Forming Alliance 
towards Positive Peace and Enriched Communities (C4PEACE) Program 
implemented the following: 

 
a. Retooled Community Support Program (RCSP) - a convergence 

mechanism for local governments, particularly in the barangay level for 
the identification of issues and needed government interventions.  

 
b. Capacitating Urban Communities for Peace and Development (CUCPD) - 

aims to end social violence by empowering Heads of Departments to 
upscale governance and collectively champion the cause of sustaining 
peace and development by bridging leadership and enabling LGUs to 
harness all available opportunities to minimize the profound feeling of 
marginalization of vulnerable sectors. 

 
14.3 To ensure convergence and coherence, DILG issued guidelines for LGUs in 

the implementation of EO 70 through DILG MC No. 2019-125 dated August 6, 
2019 whereby Local Task Forces to ELCAC are created. 

 
14.4 Further, DILG issued MC No. 2019-169 dated October 11, 2019 to provide 

guidelines in the implementation of the RCSP. It states that the RCSP shall be 
implemented in all LGUs nationwide. 

 
14.5 Additionally, DILG issued MC No. 2020-095 to provide remedial measures on 

the localization of EO 70 and all DILG peacebuilding initiatives. It prescribes 
that: 

 
Section 4.1 – Regional Offices must comply with the RCSP deliverables. The 
RCSP work plan is still consistent with the activities enumerated in DILG MC 
2020-169.  
 
Section 4.3 – RCSP target barangay may be put on-hold strictly on following 
cases: (1) increasing trend of COVID-19 positive cases in a municipality/city 
with the RCSP barangay and (2) if safety and security of field personnel will be 
seriously compromised. 



127 
 

 
14.6 Under FY 2020 GAA, DILG had appropriations of ₱85,440,000.00 for 

C4PEACE wherein it received the same amount of allotment.  Verification 
disclosed that the amount of ₱82,199,197.00 was transferred to the DILG ROs 
and ₱3,240,803.00 remain as Centrally Managed Fund under the Project 
Monitoring Office to be utilized in the performance of the outlined activities 
relative to the project. As per Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, 
Obligations, Disbursement and Balances, out of the ₱85,440,000.00 allotment, 
₱76,704,625.06 or 89.78 percent was utilized, consisting of ₱74,742,148.31 
from funds transferred to regions and ₱1,962,476.75 from the Centrally 
Managed Fund, leaving an unutilized balance of ₱8,735.374.94 or 10.22 
percent of the allotment, as shown below:

14.11 Based on the above details of accomplishments, the following activities were 

not undertaken: 
 

 Production of Audit Visual presentation on ELCAC in times of 
COVID-19; and 

 Non-publication and dissemination of localized version of Information, 
Education and Communications 
  

14.12 As per inquiry, the partial or non-accomplishment of targeted activities could 
be attributed to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and other natural 
disasters affecting the country and for the following reasons: 

  
a. Some barangays were advised to halt their operations particularly in 

the conduct of physical activities and immersions; and  
b. Some activities were dropped due to prioritization and the 

corresponding funds were realigned to Support to Regional initiatives.  
 



131 
 

14.13 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. ensure to maximize utilization of allotments through proper planning 
and timely implementation of projects/activities during the year;  and 

 
b. fast track the: (i) procurement process and ensure that all procurement 

activities are within the time frame to implement programs and 
activities; and (ii) full-implementation of the remaining uncompleted 
activities. 

Management Comments 
 

14.14 The programs/activities under the FY 2020 Annual Operations Plan and 
Budget (AOPB) of the C4PEACE Program were categorized into three (3) 
items: 

 
A. Enhanced LGU capacity to address governance and development gaps in 

the community towards transformation socio-economic development 
 

1) Initially, the fund for the conduct of continuing capacity development 
for DILG field personnel and RCSP Core Team was supposed to be 
transferred to Local Government Academy (LGA). However, it did not 
pushed through due to prioritization activities brought by COVID-19 
pandemic. Thus, it was realigned to give support for the mobilization of 
the LEO 70 PMO and for the regional initiatives in the Localization of 
EO 70 under Program Oversight. 

 
2) For CUCPD, only 77 percent of the target was accomplished in as much 

as the Local Government Units (LGUs) and Field Operating Units 
(FOUs) were constrained by the strict implementation of lockdowns that 
happened last year. 

 
B. Strengthened communication strategies, capacity development and alliance-

building with all sectors for local peace and development 
 

The allotted amount to support this item is P5,440,000.00 in partnership 
with Public Affairs and Communication Service (PACS) per approved FY 
2020 AOPB. 
 
In order to adapt with the restrictions caused by the pandemic, it was 
necessary to revisit and realign the plans and strategies for this project. After 
realignment, the funds were trimmed down into P4,136,000.00. However, 
not all activities materialized due to the following: 

 
1)  Production of AVAP on ELCAC in times of COVID-19 (P300,000.00) – 

There was a delay in the preparation of procurement requirements for 



132 
 

the AVP due to the restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic last 
year. To date, the procurement is now being done and target date of 
releases is on the 3rd quarter of the year. 

 
2)  Series of Webinars on ELCAC in times of COVID-19 (P36,000) – The 

supposed 2 webinars with 160 participants were not conducted in 2020 
due to COVID-19 pandemic. The continuing funds for these webinars 
will be realigned and utilized for the promotion of Localization of EO 70 
initiatives to various stakeholders per approved AOPB for FY 2020 
Unobligated Balances. 

 
3) Development, Localization and dissemination of printed IECs 

(P3,744,000.00) – The funds were downloaded to 14 regions during the 
4th quarter of 2020. The regions proceeded with the activities however 
delays in procurement were encountered due to uncontrollable 
circumstances brought about by the pandemic. 

 
To date, printed IEC materials on RCSP leaflets, flyers for youth and 
flyers for general public were localized into six languages from the 
original English language. These are Ilokano, Tagalog, Bicolano, 
Cebuano, Waray/Binisaya and Subanen. A total of 665,626 copies have 
been printed so far. Some have already been disseminated to their target 
stakeholders in 228 LGUs (46 municipalities and 182 barangays), 
others are still ongoing printing, while others are on the stages of 
procurement. 

 
4)  Joint DILG-PIO ELCAC Online Meetings – The conduct of Joint DILG-

PIO ELCAC Online Meetings has been dropped also, as its funds were 
realigned to the development, localization and dissemination of printed 
IEC materials. 

 
C. Program Oversight 

 
Upon realignment, this item was divided into two: (1) Central Mobilization 
Support Program and (2) Support to Regional Initiatives. 

 
1. Central Mobilization Support Program 

  
The partial-completion of the LEO 70 PMO staffing was due to late 
hiring of personnel to fill in the remaining positions. Most of the hired 
employees under the PMO only started on the 2nd semester of FY 2020. 
Moreover, conduct of hiring on the 4th quarter was prohibited per 
Memorandum dated November 09, 2020 regarding Hiring of Personnel 
on Contract of Service (COS) for the last quarter of the year. 

 



133 
 

The conduct of field visits was dropped due to travel restrictions 
imposed by IATF-MEID and LGUs protocols in response to the Covid-
19 pandemic situation. 

 
2. Support to Regional Initiatives 

 
The LEO 70 PMO initially opted to provide support and assistance to all 
Regional Offices. However, with a very limited budget at hand and 
considering that the funding is only for additional support, it did not 
require the Regional Offices to submit requests, but rather, the LEO 70 
PMO just provided funding assistance to those which requested 
additional funding. Apparently, there are four out of 16 regions that 
requested for additional funding. 

 
To date, the status of the four supported regional initiatives are the 
following: 

 
a) Activities conducted for the Peace and Resilience Center of Region 

VIII. Implementation is on-going. 
 
b) The project which aims to improve the RTF-Operation Center in 

Region IV-A (CALABARZON) took place. It was inaugurated last 
January 16, 2021 presided by Asec. Manuel Felix and participated 
by the RTF-ELCAC Members. The resolution to operationalize the 
RTF-OpCen has been approved last January 21, 2021 during the 
RTF-ELCAC meeting. 

 
c) Funds intended for the implementation of RCSP in Brngy. 

Nagbettedan, Sto. Domingo, Ilocos Sur in Region I and in the 
additional proposed 70 target barangays of Region V were already 
released to their respective targets, though the implementation is still 
on-going. 

 

With regard to the percentage of unobligated allotment in Regions III, 
VII and VIII, this is due to COVID-19 pandemic wherein these regions 
were the centers of infection outside Metro Manila. Again, the 
restriction of the movement of field officers really affect the 
implementation of the activities under this Program. The concerned 
regions are currently implementing the remaining activities within this 
year as part of their continuing activities. 

 
Region III - 56.24% 
Region VII - 29.28% 
Region VIII - 27.75% 

 



134 
 

Rest assured that the issues, concerns and challenges experienced in the 
conduct of these activities will be considered in the planning and re-
programming of strategies to ensure timely implementation of targeted 
activities. Also, the LEO 70 PMO is fully committed to fast track the 
implementation of the activities and to maximize the utilization of the 
remaining funds. 

 
 
DILG Region XII - Fund Utilization of NTF- ELCAC Funds –  

 
15. Inadequate planning and non-monitoring of utilization of NTF-ELCAC Funds 

resulted in misaligned procurements to Annual Procurement Plan, splitting of 
government contracts amounting to ₱187,200.00 to avoid posting of 
procurements in the PhilGeps and unliquidated fund transfers to field offices 
totaling ₱2,922,000.00, contrary to Republic Act No. 9184 and other pertinent 
rules and regulations. 

 
15.1 Article II, Section 7 of RA No. 9184 provides that all procurement should be 

within the approved budget of the Procuring Entity and should be meticulously 
and judiciously planned by the Procuring Entity concerned. It further provides 
that no government procurement shall be undertaken unless it is in accordance 
with the approved Annual Procurement Plan (APP) of the Procuring Entity. 
The APP shall be formulated and revised only in accordance with the 
guidelines set forth in the IRR. 
 

15.2 Splitting of Government Contracts means the division or breaking up of GoP 
contracts into smaller quantities and amounts or dividing contract 
implementation into artificial phases or sub-contracts for the purpose of 
evading or circumventing requirements of law and its IRR, particularly the 
necessity of competitive bidding and requirements for the alternative methods 
of procurement. 

 
15.3 During 2020, DILG Region XII received three sub-allotments totaling 

₱5,410,620.00 for NTF-ELCAC activities/programs. As of December 31, 
2020, based on the report submitted by the Budget Officer, 83.77 percent of the 
budget was already disbursed, details as follows: 

 
Sub-Allotment No. Budget Utilized Percentage 

SR2020-05-0848 ₱ 4,120,000.00 ₱3,794,309.97 92.09 
SR2020-09-1657 1,200,000.00 648,625.00 54.05 
SR2020-11-2084 90,620.00 89,700.00 98.98 
TOTAL ₱5,410,620.00 ₱4,532,634.97 83.77 

 
15.4 Audit of the budget and utilization of NTF-ELCAC funds revealed several 

deficiencies, summarized as follows: 
 
 



135 
 

Particulars Amount 
1. Expenses not in accordance with the initial program design  1,232,000.00 
2. Unliquidated Fund Transfers to Field Offices 2,922,000.00 
3. Non-compliance with RA No. 9184 including lack of PPMP 936,084.97 
4. Accounts Payable with incomplete supporting documents 1,057,079.00 

 
15.5 Comparison between the Program Design and Program of Expenses prepared 

by the focal person of NTF-ELCAC revealed that significant parts of the 
budget component of the initial Program Design does not coincide with its 
actual utilization; yet, no documents were submitted alongside the 
Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) which could substantiate the authority for its 
modification.  

 
Expenses not in accordance with program design and unliquidated fund 
transfers to Field Offices (FOs) 

 
15.6 One relevant change in the utilization of this budget was funds downloaded to 

field offices which totaled to ₱2,922,000.00 as of December 31, 2020. This is 
73 percent or ₱1,232,000.00 more than the initial allocation to be downloaded 
to field offices to provide support for their operations on ELCAC activities, all 
of which remained unliquidated as to date. This modification in the budget 
utilization was not supported with proper documentation. 

 
15.7 The decision to modify the utilization of the fund was allegedly due to the 

mandate of the DILG Central Office to allocate funds from NTF-ELCAC to 
support additional 40 barangays in the region. Since there was still significant 
amount of budget left under the initial sub-allotment of NTF-ELCAC fund, 
Management decided to realign part of that balance to serve the directive of the 
Central Office. On this note, it should be emphasized that even with such 
immediate instructions, Management is nonetheless required to substantiate 
any modification on their budget for monitoring, accountability and 
transparency.  

 
Non-compliance with RA No. 9184 

 
15.8 Moreover, it was also observed during audit that procurements for NTF-

ELCAC was significantly unsupported by Project Procurement Management 
Plan (PPMP) and correspondingly, purchases were also not aligned to the 
agency’s CY 2020 APP. 

 
15.9 Upon request of PPMP from the focal person, the Audit Team was given 

several supplemental PPMPs of items that were procured for NTF-ELCAC. 
However, upon matching the Program of Expenses with PPMPs, only 
₱861,750.00 (19 percent) actual procurements coincide PPMPs. Excluding 
funds transferred to field offices that remained unliquidated amounting to 
₱2,922,000.00 as to date, there was a total of ₱748,884.97 worth of 
procurements that were not found in the PPMPs submitted to COA. This is a 



136 
 

clear indication of a considerable inefficiency in the planning of procurement 
by the concerned division and failure of the BAC to countercheck requests for 
procurement that were not initially planned for the year. 

 
Accounts Payable with incomplete supporting documents 

 
15.10 Further review of transactions relating to the program also unveiled that 

Accounts Payable totaling ₱1,057,079.00 were not/inadequately supported 
with the required documents. Common problems observed with transactions 
were: (i) absence of specific activity designs, (ii) unsigned Purchase Orders by 
suppliers, (iii) significantly lesser number of actual participants attending 
meetings with catering services; and (iv) absence of Inspection and Acceptance 
Report (IAR), Charge Invoices and other related significant documents to 
substantiate the legitimacy of transactions to be paid.  

 
Splitting of government contracts to avoid posting of procurement in the PhilGeps 

 
15.11 It was also observed that among Accounts Payable, a number of procurements 

should have been procured together to avoid circumventing control measures 
promulgated by the government, summarized as follows:

15.12 Supporting documents of transactions above show that in every activity design, 
there were two separate procurements undertaken which are both below the 
amount of ₱50,000.00, the minimum limit to warrant posting of procurement 
through shopping in Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System 
(PhilGEPS). Although the nature of transactions was similar and were provided 
by the same supplier, Management practically reduced the value of purchase 
requests to make multiple awards without clear advantage for the government 



137 
 

and to side-step existing rules and provisions of law specifically, the posting of 
procurements above ₱50,000.00 threshold to PhilGEPS. Thereby, suggesting 
possibility of splitting. 

 
Failure to monitor fund transfers to Field Offices  

 
15.13 Moreover, inquiry about monitoring of fund transfers to field offices revealed 

that no monitoring is conducted to update whether or not the budgetary 
purposes or deliverables due from funds transferred are met by field offices. 
When funds were released to field offices, Local Government Monitoring and 
Evaluation Division (LGMED) no longer updates them of their expenses and 
whether or not they have liquidated the same in due time. 

 
15.14 The inadequacy in planning and non-monitoring of utilization of NTF-ELCAC 

funds considerably affected its procurement and liquidation process.  
 

15.15 We recommended that Management: 
 
a. comply with the rules and regulations set forth in RA 9184; 
 
b. monitor submission of PPMPs for consolidation in APP before the 

deadline set every year; 
 
c. monitor all funds transferred to field offices to ensure alignment with 

program designs and request for immediate liquidation of funds upon 
conclusion of every activity; 

 
d. require all PMOs to closely monitor programs assigned to their office 

through maintenance of reports so as to not solely rely on the Budget 
Officer for monitoring of their budget utilization; and 

 
e. strictly require focal persons of all programs to prepare Activity 

Designs which specifies the charging and budgetary requirements per 
activity or as practicable. 

  
15.16 On the splitting of government contracts, to avoid posting in the PhilGePS, 

Management commented that while two activities are incorporated in a single 
design, each activity is separate, conducted on different dates and with 
different purpose and requirements. 

 
COVID – 19 Fund Releases and Utilization 

 
16. Due to the unimplemented planned activities, such as, procurement of 

equipment, drugs and medicines and the like, the Department’s utilization rate 
on the allotment received under the “Bayanihan to Heal as One Act” and the 
“Bayanihan to Recover As One Act” in the total amount of ₱3,618,600,355.00 



138 
 

was below 75 percent in the DILG Central Office and seven (7) ROs, resulting in 
unobligated allotment of ₱447,629,260.33 or 12.37 percent of the total allotment. 
Other deficiencies  on COVID-19 fund utilization were also observed which 
include: (a) allocation for  training expenses amounting to ₱6,970,000.00 utilized 
for the expenses of  Emergency Operations Center (EOC) which are not related 
to training, contrary to Section 17 of the General Provisions of the General 
Appropriations Act (GAA) or R.A. No. 11465 and Chapter 3 of the GAM-NGAs, 
Volume III; (b)  disbursements made thru cash advances amounting to 
₱6,760,494.67 which contravened existing government rules and regulations on 
the handling and liquidation of cash advances and other standard 
process/procedures on disbursements, casting doubt on the validity and 
legitimacy of the expenditures; (c) incomplete documentation on the hiring of 
contact tracers; and (d) lapses in the procurement, recording  and safekeeping  
of  Personnel Protective Equipment  and other medical supplies.  
  
16.1 Pursuant to RA 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, funds amounting 

to ₱106,800,000.00 were released to DILG thru SARO No. BMB – D – 20 – 
0012603 dated June 24, 2020 to be utilized for expenses of the Emergency 
Operating Center of DILG Central and ROs, procurement of medical supplies 
and generator sets.  

  
16.2 Thereafter, RA 11494 or the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act was enacted 

and under Section 10(t) thereof states that ₱5 billion was to be allocated to 
finance hiring of at least 50,000 contact tracers to be implemented by DILG, 
which shall include but not limited to recruitment, training, compensation, 
monitoring, logistics and operational expenses. As per accounting records, the 
amount of ₱3,511,800,355.00 was released by DBM to DILG as of December 
31, 2020 thru SARO No. BMB-D-20-0016434 and SARO No. BMB-D-20- 
0020224 dated October 02, 2020 and November 25, 2020 in the amount of 
₱2,522,660,000.00 and ₱989,140,355.00, respectively.  

 

16.3 In summary, the DILG received ₱3,618,600,355.00 allotment for COVID-19 
pandemic under the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act and Bayanihan to Recover 
as One Act, of which ₱447,629,260.33 or 12.37 percent remained 
unobligated/unutilized at year-end.  The details are as follows:

  *The Department has no regional office in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), 
hence, the account for BARMM remains with CO books. Fund releases are under MOA between DILG and 
BARMM. 

 
16.10 As shown in the above table, the Central Office got the lowest utilization rate 

of 47.43 percent followed by NCR with 74.07 percent which was partially 
traced to the unutilized allotment for Supplies and Materials and Other General 
Services amounting to ₱43,640,850.00 and ₱61,516,734.00, respectively.    
Likewise, various ROs were not able to use the ₱29,256,385.00 allotment sub-
allotted to them which were intended for various expenses, such as, travelling, 
supplies and materials and Other MOOE. Details are shown below:

16.11 In summary, the bulk of unutilized fund came from the Bayanihan to Recover 

as One Act.   Based on the accomplishment report submitted by DILG, initial 
target of at least 50,000 contact tracers was attained as they have hired a total 
of 50,885 all throughout the country. However, allotment released for the said  
Act was not only intended  for hiring of contact tracers but also for other 
related expenses, such as monitoring, training, logistics and operational 
expenses.  Based on the foregoing discussions, there were funds allocated for 
procurement of equipment, supplies and materials and other operational 
expenses amounting to ₱134.413 million which were not utilized at year-end. 
Hence, the intended purpose of the fund was not achieved.

16.12  The availability of the appropriations for Bayanihan to Recover as One Act 
was extended until June 30, 2021, pursuant  to  Republic Act No. 11519, 
signed by President Rodrigo R. Duterte on December 29, 2020.     
 

16.13 We recommended that Management submit an explanation stating the 
reasons for its inability to utilize in full the COVID- 19 allotments and see 
to it that   the remaining unobligated allotments are utilized in accordance 
with intended purposes/activities by June 30, 2021, to avoid its reversion to 
the Unappropriated Surplus of the General Fund. 
 

16.14 The DILG Regional Offices provided the following comments:

Comments 

NCR Unutilized amount was due to the following reasons: 
 

1. Of the 50,000 national target for contact tracers for 
hiring, 9,285 was initially allocated to NCR. The 9,285 
contact tracers were the basis of the amount downloaded 
by the CO in the amount of ₱401,542,824.00 for salaries, 
communication and travelling expenses covering two 
months.  However, due to recalibration at the Central 
Office, NCR allocation was reduced to 7,560 and, 
subsequently, with the request of Marikina for additional 
500 contact tracers in the aftermath of Typhoon Ulysses, 
a total of 8,060 was hired in NCR. Thereby incurring 
savings for salaries, communication and travelling 
expenses for 1,225 contact tracers and was utilized for 
2021 as continuing appropriation. 

 
2. After the conduct of public bidding and its procurement 

for the Medical, Dental, Laboratory Supplies, the savings 
in the amount of ₱24,900,814.80 was generated. 

 
3. The amount of ₱61,516,734.00 for the salaries of contact 

tracers was only downloaded in late December 2020 and 
was utilized in 2021 as continuing appropriation  

 
CAR The following justifications provide for the below-average 

utilization rate: 
 

1. For expenditures undergoing procurement, procurement 
was affected and hampered due to closed business entities 
during the lockdown period. 

 
2. For Fuel, Oil and Lubricants Expenses, limited travels 



144 
 

Regional 
Office 

Comments 

due to quarantine protocols. 
 

3. For Internet Subscription Expenses, other fund sources 
were utilized. 

 
4. For ICT Software Subscription and Cloud Computing 

Service, the balance resulted in savings. 
 

Moreover, bidding for the procurement of generator sets was 
done but there was no complying bidder. 
 
The allocated amount for Travelling Expense was not fully 
utilized due to the following reasons: 

 
1. Only 14.52 percent of the contact tracers submitted their 

claims. 
2. Some LGUs provided shuttle services for contact tracers 

when they conducted their contact tracing activities. 
 

The allocated amount for Supplies and Materials Expense 
was not fully utilized due to failed bidding because of non-
availability of stocks. 

 
Unutilized amount on Other General Services was due to 
miscomputation of the amount requested resulting to an 
overage of ₱11,185,130.53. 

 
I The allocated amount for Travelling Expense was not fully 

utilized due to the following reasons: 
 

1. Some LGUs provided shuttle services for contact tracers 
from the municipality/city to the place of assignment 

2. Some of the contact tracers used their own vehicle. 
3. Contact tracers find it tedious for them to process their 

claims. 
 

CAR: The allocated amount for travelling expense was not 
fully utilized due to the following reasons: 

 
4. Only 14.52 percent of the contact tracers submitted their 

claims. 
5. Some LGUs provided shuttle services for contact tracers 

when they conducted their contact tracing activities.

CAR: Unutilized amount on Other General Services was due

overage of ₱11,185,130.53 
 

II The balances in the Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies 
amounting to ₱514,370.00; Drugs and Medicine Expenses, 
₱527,519.75 and Other Supplies Expenses amounting to 
₱485,031.00 were not utilized as of December 31, 2020 
because of the existing inventories on-hand during that 
period, thus, these balances were expected to be utilized in 
the first quarter of 2021. However, on February 18, 2021, a 
Department Memorandum was received requiring Regional 
Offices not to utilize the unobligated balances as of 
December 31, 2020. 
 

XI The following justifications were provided for the below-
average utilization rate: 

 
1. Conduct of trainings was cancelled due to operational 

limits imposed on the number of participants allowed per 
venue followed by placement of the region under MECQ 
and MGCQ status and also, in compliance with safety 
protocols/ guidelines mandated by respective local 
governments. 

 
2. Submitted claims for mobile and travelling 

reimbursement were disregarded and not processed due 
to lack of supporting documents forwarded by claimants. 
Hence, respective communication and transportation 
allowances were also underutilized. 

 
3. For expenditures undergoing procurement, 

underutilization was attributable to the difference 
between the amount of budget in contract (ABC) and bid 
amount. Also, due to time constraints/ nearing year-end, 
the supplier was unable to deliver medical supplies 
ordered on or before year-end. 

 
XI Procurement of generator sets were cancelled because the 

supplier was unable to deliver the number of equipment

ordered. Only two generator sets were available for delivery 
out of five as requested.  Hence, the funds allocated for 
procurement of equipment were unutilized. 
 

XIII Please note that the correct Disbursement Rate is 98.90 
percent instead of 54.24 percent. Per clarification/validation 
at DILG-CO that there was an error in presenting the data

Results of Audit of Expenses of Emergency Operating Center- DILG, CO 
 

16.15 The COVID-19 funds allocated  for training expenses amounting to 
P6,970,000.00 were utilized for the expenses of  Emergency Operations Center 
(EOC) which are not related to training, contrary to Section 17 of the General 
Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) or RA 11465 and Chapter 
3 of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies 
(GAM-NGAs), Volume III. Moreover, disbursements made thru cash advances 
amounting to ₱6,760,494.67 contravened some of the existing government 
rules and regulations in the handling and liquidation of cash advances and 
other standard process/procedures on disbursements, casting doubt on the 
validity and legitimacy of the expenditures.  
 

16.16 DILG has allocated funds for COVID related activities amounting to 
₱118,567,428.50, of which, ₱106,800,000 came from the Bayanihan to Heal as 
One Act received thru SARO No. SARO-BMB-D-20-0012603 dated June 24, 
2020 and ₱11,767,428.50 was realigned from FY 2020 GAA Regular 
Appropriations.  Total amount obligated was ₱110,489,428.50 where 
P96,800,000.00 was transferred to DILG ROs and ₱13,689,428.50 at DILG-

16.18 The Emergency Operations Center was created in accordance with Department 
Order Nos. 2020-249 and 2020-250 both dated March 16, 2020 issued by the 
DILG during initial lockdown procedures undertaken at the onset of COVID-
19 Pandemic. The purpose stated in the Department Order is to accurately 
monitor the spread and decrease of dangers of COVID-19 and aid making 
informed and sound decisions on how to combat and properly manage the 
disease and employ other strategies to minimize its spread and effects. 
 

16.19 Audit of liquidation reports and supporting documents disclosed the following: 
 
 Out of ₱6,970,000.00 cash advances granted to SDOs, ₱209,505.33 was 

refunded to the Cashier and ₱6,760,494.67 was spent for the following 
EOC expenses which were recorded under the Training Expenses account.   

 
Nature of expenses Amount Percentage 

Food ₱6,362,567.65 94.12

However, we found no proof/indicator of training activities conducted at 
the Center based on the review of documents supporting the liquidation 
reports.  Thus, use of training fund for EOC expenses is inconsistent with 
the provisions of Section 17, General Provisions of GAA FY 2020 (R.A. 
1465) and Chapter 3 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume III. 
 

 Three of cash advances granted to SDOs totaling ₱500,000.00 (Letter D to 
F of the table under paragraph 29.15) were not supported with activity 
designs containing among others the fund/budgetary requirements of the 
activity, contrary to Section 1.1.3 of COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 
14, 2012 and Section 4(6) of P.D. No. 1445.   As such, the Auditor 
encountered difficulty in determining whether disbursements made were 
within approved activity budget. 
 

 Provision for meals and snacks to personnel detailed at the EOC at a daily 
rate of ₱1,000.00 per person was indicated only in the activity designs and 
not specifically stated in the Department Order; hence, granting thereof is 
questionable.  Food expenses served at the EOC amounted to 
₱6,362,567.65 or 94.12 percent of the total expenses of the Center. 

 
 SDOs continued using cash advances for various expenses totaling 

₱4,312,909.86 even beyond the period covered by the activity designs 
contrary to Section 89 of PD 1445 providing among others that, cash 
advances shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for 
which it was given has been served.  Given the fact that government 
resources are limited, its utilization is of utmost importance.  The 
excess/unutilized balance of cash advance should have been refunded to the 
Cashier.    
 

 Food items amounting to ₱755,126.00 were not supported with necessary 
evidence of payment or not in proper acceptable form as prescribed under 
COA Circular No. 2004-006.  These food items are usually bought from 
wet markets like, fish, pork, beef, vegetables, etc.  Of the said amount, 
₱631,132.00 was supported by a default receipt containing the date, 
description of purchases, corresponding amount and signed by unnamed 
person, while other disbursements amounting to ₱123,994.00 were 
supported only by a torn sheet of paper where the amount and description 
of the goods are written.   

 
 COA Circular No. 2004-006 provides that although evidence of receipt of 

payment may take several forms it must contain the following minimum 
data: 

a. Name of Disbursing Officer making the payment  
b. Date of payment  
c. Name of Recipient  
d. Address of Recipient  



150 
 

e. Purpose of Payment  
f. Amount of Payment Received 

 
16.20 In Region IVB, in line with the EOC COVID 19, DILG MIMAROPA Region 

draw cash advances to support operations as follows:

Total    387,200.00 
 

16.21 During audit of liquidation reports, it was noted that the amount of 
₱387,200.00 was charged against Training Expenses representing meals and 
snacks and other supplies during conduct of EOC COVID 19. Summary of 
purchases made is presented below: 

 
Particulars Amount 

COVID 19 Health Protocol Supplies 19,594.50 
Vitamins and Medicines 22,117.61 
Dormitory Furniture & Supplies 17,140.00 
Food/Groceries/Meals/Snacks 312,916.58 
Cell Cards 2,180.00 
Freon 4,000.00 
Electrical Supplies 4,935.00 
Others 3,436.95 
Total 386,320.64 

 
16.22 Meals and snacks may be charged to Training Expenses as long as these are 

training-related expense. However, it was noted that meals and snacks and 
other supplies were consumed by the personnel assigned at the EOC COVID 
19; thus, do not fall within the definition given for Training Expenses.  

 
16.23 Management commented that said transactions were charged to Training 

Expenses because of the activity design.  They believe that every activity with 
corresponding design should always be charged to Training Expenses. 

 
16.24 Moreover, review of the transaction in Liquidation Report No.2020-05-010 

dated May 5, 2020 amounting to ₱100,000.00, disclosed unspent cash advance 
of ₱942.18.  However, said amount was not refunded to  the Collecting Officer 
and corresponding Official Receipt issued was not attached as part of 
supporting documents of Liquidation Report as mandated in Section 5.8 of 
COA Circular 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 

 
 
 



151 
 

16.25 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. submit basis for providing meals and snacks to personnel assigned at 
Emergency Operations Center using the COVID 19 funds for Training 
Expenses. Observe prudence in the use of government funds by strictly 
adhering to the pertinent government rules and regulations;  

 
b. submit activity design for three cash advances for audit/validation 

purposes. See to it that granting of cash advances is completely 
documented in compliance with Section 1.1.3 of COA Cir. 2012-001 
dated June 14, 2012 and Section 4(6) of P.D. No. 1445; 

 
c. strictly observe provisions of COA Circular 2004-006 which prescribes 

guidelines on acceptable evidence of receipt of payment for 
disbursements;  

 
d. explain why expenses incurred beyond the period covered by activity 

designs shall be allowed in audit.  Henceforth, utilize cash advances 
granted only for the intended purpose and within the intended date of 
utilization; and 

 
e. require the AO to refund excess cash advance amounting to ₱942.18. 

 
16.26 Management submitted the following comments: 

 
a. In Central Office, Management explained that DILG is one of the key 

agencies involved in the formulation of policies, implementation of 
identified measures to address the COVID 19 pandemic, monitoring 
compliance of various LGUs and reporting relevant information. Data to 
the Office of the President (OP) and that there is a need to activate an 
Incident Command System thru EOC which is an on scene (DILG-CO) 
pandemic response mechanism that will manage reports and other 
consequences associated with COVID 19. 

 
b. Cited that the fund release under SARO No. BMB-D-20-0012603 dated 

June 24, 2020 was intended for operations of EOC; monitoring of 
activities/measures to address the pandemic, LSIs and compliance of 
LGUs; support employees’ welfare program and other expenditures related 
to COVID-19. 
 

c. Appealed for some flexibility and relaxation of some of the rules that the 
expenses will be favorably considered due to the current pandemic 
situation having limited stores available for essential goods. 
 

d. Moreover, Management believes that there is need to provide meals and 
snacks for concerned personnel during their duty to support and boost 



152 
 

employees’ morale/performance as well as their health concerns provided 
that it is in accordance with existing policy of the Department. Employees 
assigned in EOC are accorded with support mechanism such as meals 
provided under MC No. 18 s. of 2020 as other monetary and other forms of 
incentives as may be allowed or upon approval of the head of agencies. 
 

e. Lastly, amount of cash advances granted to a Head Executive Assistant was 
based on daily rate per department’s existing policy and with assumption 
that the quarantine period will not be extended whereas during the purchase 
of items/food supplies, allocation for each employee is lesser than the 
estimated budget that resulted to the extension of utilization of cash 
advance. 

 
      Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 
16.27 Management cited DILG Circular No. 2017-03, which provides the guidelines 

on the allocation of funds for venue, meals and snacks and room 
accommodation for training, seminars and Human Resource Development 
activities conducted by DILG Local Government Sector as basis in the 
provision of snacks and meals for the Emergency Operation Center (EOC) 
using the funding support for the activity through Training Expenses.  As 
observed, the EOC activity is not within the context of training.  For the 
continued operation of the EOC, request/provide the appropriate funding and 
authority to support the activities expenditures.  
 

Although, this is an extraordinary time, compliance to the provisions of COA 
Circular No. 2004 – 006 cannot be dispensed with as it intends to ensure the 
integrity and validity of all government expenditures in cases where the 
Official Receipts, which is the required evidence for the receipt of payment for 
disbursements of government agencies, is not available for cases where the 
recipient is not that type of business which have a pre-printed ORs, same as the 
case where the items were bought in the market from stores not maintaining 
ORs. The Circular only provides for minimum data required that could be used 
to establish the validity and legitimacy of the expenditure.  

 
The Audit Team stands firm that government funds must be spent in 
accordance with the intended purposes to prevent misspending and wastage of 
scarce government resources.    
 
Moreover, it should be emphasized that all disbursements should be properly 
documented as required under existing laws, rules and regulations to establish 
their validity and propriety.

Incomplete documentation on the hiring of Contact Tracers 
 

16.28 The requirements in hiring of contact tracers was provided in the Memoranda 
dated September 11, 2020 and September 20, 2020, prescribing basic and 
additional requirements for hiring of contract tracers as follows: 

 
16.29 In NCR, in order to check whether the hiring requirements were complied 

with, the Audit Team selected 50 samples of hired contact tracers for each City 
Field Office.  The team examined documents uploaded in DILG-NCR Contact 
Tracer Portal and results thereof showed that not all samples had completely 
submitted the requirements.    

 
16.30 The result of our evaluation was communicated to DILG-NCR Management in 

a letter dated January 14, 2021 where we requested to upload through the 
portal or submit to the Audit Team within 15 days upon receipt of said letter 
the lacking documents of concerned contact tracers for validation and to 
facilitate completion of the audit.  The list of sampled contact tracers with 
incomplete documentation was attached to the letter. 

 
16.31 The audit result was also raised during exit conference on March 1, 2021 to 

follow-up the submission of the lacking requirements, which is on or before 
March 5, 2021.   Again, we checked the portal to see if lacking documents 
were already uploaded; however, we found that there were contact tracers with 
incomplete requirements as summarized below.

16.32 The non-submission of complete requirements by contact tracers is contrary to 

the guidelines prescribed under the abovementioned DILG Memorandum.  It 
also affected the veracity of the selection process as well as payment of 
salaries/wages of the concerned contact tracers.  
 

16.33 We recommended that Management direct the City Director to require 
the concerned contact tracers to submit lacking requirements to the Audit 
Team for verification/validation purposes in order to avoid audit 
suspension/disallowance. 
 

Procurement of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) and other medical supplies 
 

16.34 In Region II, funds totaling ₱86,918,967.00 were received from the DILG 
Central  Office intended for COVID 19 related expenses. 

 
16.35 Out of ₱86,918,967.00, the amount of ₱5,683,770.00 was obligated for the 

procurement of PPEs and other medical supplies intended for the protection of 
the Contact Tracers in the performance of their duties. However, after all 
procurement processes were completed, these PPEs and other medical supplies 



155 
 

were delivered on December 28, 2020, thus, the purpose for which it was 
intended was not attained since the services of the Contact Tracers ended on 
December 31, 2020.  Therefore, the fund was not effectively utilized due to 
poor management of scarce government resources. Details of the items 
procured is shown below:

TOTAL ₱5,683,770.00 
 

16.36 It was further observed, after deducting the items already distributed to DILG 
Provincial Directors on December 28, 2020, except for the Province of 
Batanes, there were several items remained in the DILG Regional Office as 
discovered during inventory conducted on January 22, 2021 with some noted 
discrepancies presented below:

16.37 Had Management been circumspect in the utilization of government resources, 
procurement of the above items could have been dispensed with knowing fully 
well the surrounding circumstances; thus, wastage of government resources 
could have been avoided. 

 
16.38 In Region IVB, due to the nature of the activities to be conducted by the 

contract tracers, the DILG MIMAROPA Region purchased Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) to effectively carry out their duties. 

 



156 
 

16.39 Inquiry with Management disclosed that procured PPE for use by contract 
tracers were all issued to DILG Provincial Offices.  Moreover, audit of 
financial transactions disclosed that all medical supplies and materials 
purchased were directly recorded as outright expense instead of initially 
recording it under Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies for Distribution 
Inventory account. 

 
16.40 It was also noted that Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) and Stock Card (SC) were 

not maintained/updated by the Accountant and the Procurement Officer, 
respectively.  The Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) was also 
not prepared by the Supply Officer. As a result, the Audit Team cannot 
establish whether all PPE were issued during the year.  

 
16.41 In Region XI, the agency received the downloaded allocations under Sub-

Allotment Release Orders (Sub-AROs) amounting to ₱27,367,200.00 for the 
procurement of PPEs, Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Expenses to be 
used by the Contact Tracers for the months of October to December 2020 with 
breakdown below:  
 

Sub-Allotment No. Date Amount 
SR 2020-10-1896 10-05-2020 ₱   9,579,150.00 
SR 2020-10-1969 10-12-2020      9,579,150.00 
SR 2020-12-2155 12-01-2020      8,208,900.00 

         Total ₱27,367,200.00 
 

16.42 The concerned DILG XI City/Provincial Directors failed to act immediately on 
the prerequisites of the procurement of the necessary PPEs and common 
medicines for Contact Tracers.  There were gaps of 49 days and 60 days from 
receipt of Sub-AROs on October 05, 2020 and October 12, 2020, respectively, 
until the opening of bids on the first release and second release of funds from 
DILG Central Office.  While the third tranche was only received on December 
01, 2020 and the opening of bids was on the 17th of December 2020, thereby 
incurring a gap of only 17 days. 
 

16.43 However, procured items in the first tranche amounting to ₱5,837,800.00 were 
distributed to the different DILG City and Provincial Offices for the use of the 
Contact Tracers with 18 day remaining period of their contracts, from 
December 12 to 31, 2020. 

 
16.44 Further, it was also noted that deliveries of PPEs and common medicines for 

second and third tranches totaling ₱13,756,058.00 were delivered only on 
December 28-29, 2020, the last working days of the year.  These medical 
supplies and materials were not distributed to end users considering 31 
December 2020 was also the last working day of all Contact Tracers. Thus, 
resulted in the overstocking of PPEs and common medicines in the premises of 
DILG Region XI.    



157 
 

 
16.45 While we noted the time pressure that beset the Management, the personal 

health of 3,041 Contact Tracers was not fully protected against COVID-19 
during performance of their duties due to failure of Management and BAC to 
adequately plan the procurement of needed PPEs and common medical 
supplies.  
 

16.46 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. For Region II, ensure that all resources of the government be managed 
and safeguarded against wastage with a view to ensuring efficiency and 
effectiveness in operations of government pursuant to Section 2 of P.D. 
1445;  
 

b. For Region II, account discrepancies noted on remaining items still in 
the possession of the Supply Officer and submit written report thereon 
including list of recipients; 
  

c. For Region IVB, submit list of recipients indicating the names, date of 
actual receipt and quantity;  
 

d. instruct the Chief Accountant to record in the appropriate inventory 
account all purchases of medical, dental and laboratory supplies upon 
acceptance of delivered items except those purchased out of the Petty 
Cash Fund; maintain Supplies Ledger Card for each item of inventory 
and record issuances to end-users upon submission by Supply Officer 
of the RSMI duly supported with approved Requisition and Issue Slip; 
and adhere to perpetual inventory method to ensure that materials 
issued are properly recorded and unused materials are properly 
accounted for;  

 
e. instruct the Bids and Awards Committee to act promptly on 

procurements that are of great importance to contain or mitigate 
transmission of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) following 
Guidelines for Emergency Procurement under RA No. 11469 or the 
Bayanihan to Heal as One Act; 

 
f. require the Supply Officer to secure and safe keep PPEs from wear 

and tear in a well-protected place/bodega and undertake measures and 
safeguards to protect common medicines and other medical supplies 
from pilferages; and 

 
g. For Region XI, direct the BAC or BAC Secretariat to submit 

justifications on delayed procurement of PPEs and other medical 
supplies which lead to non-distribution of the same to the hired Contact 
Tracers.  



158 
 

 
Management Comments 

 
16.47 Region II is fully compliant with Section 2 of P.D. 1445 in ensuring efficiency, 

economy and effectiveness in the operation of the government. 
 

16.48 The Management thru General Services Section conducted an accounting of 
discrepancies on the remaining items in the possession of the Supply Officer. A 
report was submitted to the Office of the Resident Auditor noting that the 
accounted excess and lacking PPEs and other medical supplies were 
considered in the next round of procurement for the rehired contact tracers. 

 
16.49 The Management issued a Memorandum dated March 18, 2021 to all 

Provincial Directors enjoining them to conduct an inventory of received items. 
The distribution lists from the Provincial Offices were already submitted to the 
Office of the Resident Auditor for reference. 
 

16.50 Region XI: The Management acknowledged the deficiencies cited in the AOM 
and took note of the recommendations and based on these took the following 
corrective measures: 

 
16.51 The DILG XI Bids and Awards Committee immediately convened to inform 

the body of the COA findings and recommendations. During the emergency 
meeting, it was stressed that the BAC should prioritize action on important 
procurements, especially concerning the pandemic, membership in the BAC 
being a jury duty. 

 
16.52 The GSSU Head (Supply Officer) was already informed to mobilize and assign 

GSSU personnel to handle appropriately bulk procurement of medical supplies 
and PPEs to ensure safekeeping. However, the office is not capable to hold in 
possession bulk deliveries of PPEs and medical supplies because of the 
absence of a warehouse/bodega, hence direct issuance of subject supplies to 
FOUs is opted by the Management. 
 

16.53 DILG Regional Office XI also submitted the following 
explanation/justification on the causes of the delay in the procurement of PPEs: 
 
1) The BAC was not able to immediately convene for said procurement 

transaction due to quorum issue. Members are so much preoccupied with 
urgent operational concerns such as the hiring of contact tracers and 
processing of their individual contracts; 
 

2) Suppliers who responded to the bid call for the transaction declined to 
submit price quotations in view of the existing shortage of supply in the 
market due to high demand amid the existing pandemic; 

 



159 
 

3) The market analysis undertaken by the BAC-TWG with seven (7) 
probable suppliers on the above-mentioned procurement showed that each 
supplier cannot provide all the items required per lot; and 

 
4) Suppliers took time to submit their bid documents because of the 

unavailability of supplies for this bulk procurement. 
 

Incomplete Documentation of Fund Utilization 
 

16.54 In October 2020, Region III received additional allotment totaling 
₱327,732,134.00 under various sub-allotments issued by the Central Office 
(Sub-Allotment No. SR2020-10-1908 dated October 5, 2020 amounting to 
₱148,441,014.00, Sub-Allotment No. SR2020-10-1915 dated October 5, 2020 
amounting to ₱3,417,806.00, Sub-Allotment No. SR2020-10-1960 dated

SR2020-12-2146 dated December 1, 2020 amounting to ₱27,432,300.00)  to 
cover funding requirements for hiring of 5,992 contact tracers pursuant to 
Section 10(t) of RA No. 11494 “Bayanihan to Recover as One Act.” 
 

16.55 Of the total allotment received amounting to ₱327,732,134.00,  
₱318,996,426.18 or 97.33 percent was expended. Audit of disbursements for 
hiring of contact tracers and other related expenses disclosed the following 
deficiencies:

Management. 

 
16.57 We recommended that Management instruct the Regional Accountant to 

submit immediately to the Audit Team paid disbursement vouchers 
pertaining to COVID Funds together with supporting documents to avoid 
audit suspension.  Henceforth, ensure that claims are supported with 
complete documentation prior to payment.

Status of Audit Suspensions and Disallowances 
 
17. Audit suspensions and disallowances totaling ₱44,064,389.14 and 

₱103,577,392.03, respectively, remained unsettled as at year-end due to failure of 
Management to strictly enforce settlement thereof, contrary to Sections 7.1.1,

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 
18. Nine of the planned programs and activities in Regional Offices intended for 

Gender and Development were not implemented due to COVID 19 pandemic. In 
Central Office, Management failed to submit to the Audit Team a copy of the 
approved Annual GAD Plans and Budget (GPB), as well as the GAD 



163 
 

Accomplishment Report for CY 2020 within the prescribed period, contrary to 
COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014. 
 
18.1 Section 31 of the GAA for CY 2020 requires all agencies of the government to 

formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender 
issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable 
provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing 
Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development 
(1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).  
 

18.2 The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, 
which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. For this purpose, 
activities currently undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that 
contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of 
marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s 
human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered 
sufficient compliance of said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget shall 
be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said 
agencies. 

 
18.3 The agency allocated ₱570,986,000.46 in gender responsive programs, projects 

and activities of DILG-Offices for CY 2020, which is 7.46 percent of the total 
appropriations.

Programs and Projects Related to Senior Citizens and Differently-Abled Persons 

 
19. The DILG Central Office and two Regional Offices failed to formulate plans, 

programs and projects for Senior Citizens and Differently-Abled persons which 
is not keeping with Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020. 
 
19.1 Section 32, General Provisions of GAA for 2020, RA No. 11465 requires that: 
 

 All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs 
and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and 
persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated 
functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities. 



165 
 

 
Moreover, all government facilities, including infrastructure, non-
infrastructure and civil works projects of the government as well as 
office buildings, streets and highways shall provide architectural or 
structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably 
enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability 
pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and R.A. No. 7277. 

 
19.2 Likewise, Section 4.2 of the Joint DBM and DSWD Circular No. 2003-01 

dated April 28, 2003 provides that, all government agencies, departments, 
bureaus, offices, commissions and state universities and colleges shall allocate 
at least one percent (1%) of their respective budget for the implementation of 
plans, programs, projects, activities and services for older persons and persons 
with disabilities.

cost since some regions failed to include the budget cost in their reports. 
 

19.5 In Region III, Management failed to allocate at least one percent of their 
budget for programs and projects intended for senior citizens and differently 
abled persons contrary to the provisions of GAA and Section 4.2 of the Joint 
DBM and DSWD Circular No. 2003-01; thus, defeating its purpose to fully 
address the needs of intended beneficiaries. 

 
19.6 We recommended that Management formulate plans, programs and 

projects for Senior Citizens and Differently-Abled persons, in compliance 
with Section 32 of the General Provisions of GAA for FY 2020. 

 

 

Compliance with Tax laws 
 

20. The DILG withheld applicable taxes on income payments in compliance with 
Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 23-2012 dated February 14, 2012 
from contractors/suppliers/creditors as prescribed by existing tax laws. 

 
20.1 RMC No. 23-2012 dated February 14, 2012 reiterates responsibilities of 

officials and employees of government offices for the withholding of 
applicable taxes on certain income payments and imposition of penalties for 
non-compliance thereof.
