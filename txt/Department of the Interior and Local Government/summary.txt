C)	SCOPE OF AUDIT



The audit covered the financial accounts and operations for calendar year 2020 of the Central Office (CO) and the 16 Regional Offices (RO).  The report does not include RO Nos. VIII and XIII due to non-submission of the Auditor’s report at the time of consolidation.



D)	INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT



	The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the DILG as of December 31, 2020.

	



E)	SUMMARY OF OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 



1)	The reliability of DILG’s Consolidated Financial Statements cannot be established due to accounting errors and omissions totalling ₱57,768,185.56 comprising of (a) misstatement in Cash in Bank account; (b) discrepancy between inventory reports and accounting records; (c) errors in the recording of Property, Plant and Equipment; (d) errors in recording in the subsidiary ledgers of Due to GOCCs and Other Payables accounts; and (e) misclassification  of legal services, which resulted in the misstatement of affected accounts. (Observation No. 1)



We recommended that Management require/direct the concerned Accountants, Disbursing Officers, Supply and General Services and Property Sections to:   (a) strictly comply with the provisions of Section 56, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Vol. 1 relative to the preparation of Schedule of Unreleased Checks and Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to recognize the restoration of cash and liabilities in order to present the true balance of both accounts in the financial statements; (b) notify the payees with stale checks in their possession for cancellation and replacement. Make sure that such cancellation/replacement will be in the RO for appropriate adjustment/s in the books of accounts; (c) verify the nature of unrecorded deposits/bank Credit Memo (CM) amounting to ₱686,754.84 and submit necessary documents as basis of the bank CM and make necessary adjusting entries; (d) to make necessary adjusting entry affecting the Cash in Bank –Local Currency Current Account and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit account; (e)  make a representation with the bank for immediate submission of supporting documents for bank DMs amounting to ₱10,325,811.73 and prepare a JEV to recognize the same in the books; (f) complete the reconciliation of the noted discrepancies in the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) and adjust the Supplies Ledger Card and Stock Cards accordingly; (g)  conduct periodic reconciliation of their records and prepare necessary adjustments, if any; (h) prepare necessary adjustments for errors identified for fair presentation of affected accounts; (i) exert best effort to identify the causes/s and make necessary adjustments for the negative balances; and (j) provide basis for charging compensation of hired private lawyers against funds appropriated for Locally-Funded Project, Support for Local Governance Program and recording the same under Other General Services account.



2)	The accuracy, completeness and valuation of the reported accounts in the financial statements cannot be ascertained due to accounting deficiencies, such as: (a) discrepancies between the balances per books and bank, registries, records of implementing/source agencies and  property records;                     (b) unaccounted balance of fund transfer in the books of DILG NCR; and        (c) inclusion of negative amount in the Due from NGAs account of DILG NCR and amount labeled as “For Reconciliation or Unrecon” in the balance of Due to GOCCs and Other Payables. (Observation No. 2)

		

We recommended that Management: (a) direct the Accountant in the National Capital Region (NCR) to account for the difference of ₱2,223,176.53 by preparing the Bank Reconciliation Statements for each bank account from August to December 2018 and effect the necessary adjustments in the books to present the correct balance of the Cash in Bank –Local Currency Current Account at any given period; (b) require the Provincial Offices to submit the Cash in Bank Register  along with  its supporting  documents within five days at the end of each month; (c) require the Accountant to prepare the necessary adjustments to record disbursements for the month of December 2020 of Provincial Offices; (d) investigate discrepancies noted and make necessary adjustments, if warranted; (e) coordinate/reconcile with implementing agencies relative to the unrecorded liquidations; (f) require the Accounting Section and Supply and General Service Section to reconcile their records with that of the Procurement Service – Department of Budget and Management and prepare necessary adjustment, if warranted; (g) require the Accounting and Property Office to conduct periodic reconciliation of their records and prepare necessary adjustments, if any; (h) require the Accountant to identify cause/s and make necessary adjustments for errors identified, unreconciled amount and unaccounted balances; and (i) require the Accountant to prepare breakdown or details of the Due to NGAs account and make necessary adjustment taking up accounting error, if any.



3)	Weakness in cash management was noted resulting from: (a) deficiencies in granting and handling of Petty Cash Fund (PCF); (b) insufficient and failure to renew Fidelity Bond of Disbursing Officer; (c) failure of Accountable Officers to maintain Cash Disbursement Record (CDR); and (d) failure to liquidate cash advances within the prescribed period, contrary to the existing rules and regulations. (Observation No. 3)



We recommended that Management: (a) strictly adhere to accounting policies on disbursement by checks and setting-up of cash advance for petty operating expenses as provided in Sections 8 and 35, Chapter 6 of GAM, Vol. 1;           (b) require Accountable Officers (AOs) to use Petty Cash Voucher for payments out of PCF and Report on Paid Petty Cash Vouchers (RPPCV) for reporting disbursements out of PCF for replenishment, in compliance to the provisions of GAM; (c) require the AOs to ensure that petty cash disbursements are adequately supported with necessary documents in compliance with the GAM for National Government Agencies (NGAs)  to avoid suspension in audit; (d) stop the grant of cash advances to AOs with unsettled accounts in line with Section 89 of P.D. No. 1445 and Section 4.1.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 in order to prevent accumulation of unliquidated cash advances beyond the maximum limit of the bond; (e) require the concerned AOs to apply for fidelity bond sufficient to cover their accountabilities; (f) require the AOs to maintain the prescribed CDR to record daily transactions and monitor cash advance balance.  Likewise, instruct the Chief Accountant to brief newly designated AOs on matters related to their duties; (g) require the AO to immediately liquidate cash advance by refunding the amount of ₱90,192.00; and (h) ensure strict compliance to the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 pertinent to the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances.



4)	Unutilized operating funds of City/Provincial Offices in three regions totaling      P61,414,137.92 were retained and not deposited to the Bureau of the Treasury contrary to E.O. No. 388. (Observation No. 4)



We recommended that Management require the Regional Accountant and the Provincial/City Accounting Clerk to: (a) remit to Bureau of the Treasury the unexpended amount from unimplemented trainings, savings from previous years’ Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses and interest income from bank accounts and prepare necessary adjusting entries; and (b) stop the practice of transferring funds to Provincial Offices more than their operational requirements at any given period to prevent existence of idle funds and maximize timely utilization of government resources.



5)	Fund transfers to national government agencies, government owned and/or controlled corporations, LGUs, ROs and non-government organizations have accumulated to ₱3,629,683,340.01 as at year-end due to: (a) non-submission of liquidation reports by Implementing Agencies (IAs) and Operating Units contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013 and related Memoranda of Agreement (MOA); and (b) liquidation of fund transfers not supported with complete documentation. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) strictly monitor and enforce liquidation of fund transfers in accordance with COA Circular No. 94-013 and relevant provisions of the MOA; and determine the cause for non-liquidation of the same; (b) require IAs to refund the unexpended balance for all completed undertakings; (c) refrain from granting additional fund transfers to agencies with unliquidated balances and adhere strictly to the requirement of COA Circular No. 2016-002 dated May 31, 2016; and (d) instruct the Chief Accountant to properly review liquidation report and see to it that documentary requirements are complete and compliant to Section 3.1.3 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prior to recording in the  books of accounts.



6)	Weakness on asset management was noted due to: (a) non-preparation and submission of RPCI of DILG Field Operating Units (FOUs) in Region 10 as required in GAM; (b) non-preparation and submission of Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) of DILG Region IV-B contrary to  Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I;    (c) non-updating of  Property Cards (PCs) in DILG NCR and Region III contrary to Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume 1 of the GAM for NGAS; and     (d) non-issuance of Property Acknowledgement Receipt f (PAR) for all issued PPEs in CAR. (Observation No. 6)

7)	Contract of Service (COS) workers were allowed to reimburse Daily Travel Expense (DTE) and use of Certification of Expenses not requiring Receipts instead of official receipts for taxi fares. (Observation No. 7)



We recommended that Management: (a) explain/justify why DTE claimed by COS workers should be allowed in audit; and (b) enforce presentation/submission of receipts for taxi fares amounting to ₱300.00 or less, in compliance to COA Circular No. 2017-001 dated June 19, 2017.



8)	The DILG Central Office contracted and paid the services of two private lawyers in the total amount of ₱1,687,464.58 for Calendar Year 2020, without written conformity and acquiescence of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) and written concurrence of COA which is in direct violation of COA Circular No. 95-011 dated December 4, 1995 and OSG Memorandum dated December 15, 2015.  (Observation No. 8)



We recommended that Management: (a) provide necessary justification why payment of retainer’s fee to two private lawyers contracted to provide legal services for DILG’s Bantay-Korapsyon program should be allowed in audit in the absence of required written conformity and acquiescence of OSG and written concurrence of COA; and (b) moving forward, strictly comply to the provisions of  COA Circular No. 95-011 dated December 4, 1995 and OSG Memorandum dated December 15, 2015 on the hiring of private lawyers.

		

9)	Fully finished 1-Storey DILG Albay Provincial Operations Office Building amounting to ₱4.6 million was not occupied and utilized since its completion in November 2018 due to gaps in project implementation such as absence of building and occupancy permits, variation between work accomplishment and As Built Plan and Program of Works and Construction Plan, absence of transformer and electricity lines, and building defects, among others. Further, repair works were not undertaken to correct the discovered defects in the building within the defects liability period nor the cost of the repair was claimed against the surety bond posted by the Contractor due to expiration of performance bond, contrary to Sections 39 and 62 and Annex E of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184. (Observation No. 9)  

	

We recommended that Management: (a) facilitate the obtention of necessary permits for the project and any penalties and fines that may be imposed for failing to obtain the same shall be the account of the responsible personnel;    (b) undertake necessary repair of the DILG Albay Provincial Operations office building to make it operational and make a representation with service provider for the installation of electrical transformer; (c) evaluate the performance of the concerned Contractor using NEDA approved Contractor’s Performance Evaluation System guidelines for the type of project implemented and submit the same to the Construction Industry Authority of the Philippines, thereafter, consider the blacklisting procedure, if warranted, based on the results of the performance evaluation; (d) pursue legal action against the Contractor for failure to perform his contractual obligation; and (e) ensure that pertinent provisions of R.A. No. 9184 are enforced in the implementation of project to protect the interest of government.

	

10)	Out of the ₱658,716,722.00 funds allocated for the 20 locally funded projects, only ₱454,344,216.87 was obligated resulting in unutilized allotment of ₱204,372,505.13. Likewise, programmed/planned activities were partially or not implemented in view of low fund utilization rate ranging from zero to 72.56 percent. (Observation No. 11)

	

We recommended that Management: (a) improve its absorptive capacity through timely implementation of programs and activities to avoid expiration of allotments and lapsing of cash allocations; and (b) require officials concerned to monitor utilization of project funds and see to it that programmed activities are implemented in due time.

	

11)	Utilization of funds allocated for Philippine Anti-Illegal Drugs Strategy amounting to ₱49,558,884.00 was not maximized as ₱21,339,940.75 or 43.06 percent thereof was not utilized caused by either non-implementation or partial implementation of activities because of the restrictions imposed by COVID 19 pandemic. (Observation No. 12)

	

We recommended that Management: (a) maximize the utilization of allotments through proper planning and timely implementation of projects/activities during the year; and (b) fast track the procurement process to ensure that all procurement activities are within the time frame to implement the programs and activities and that the remaining uncompleted activities are fully implemented.

	

12)	DILG accomplished only 63.64 percent of the 22 planned targets/activities and incurred obligation of P27,525,614.07 or 72.56 percent of the ₱37,935,414.00 total allotments received for the Manila Clean-Up project, resulting in unobligated allotment of ₱10,409,799.93 for unimplemented planned targets. (Observation No. 13)

	

We recommended that Management: (a)  require the Project Monitoring Office (PMO) to take necessary measures to ensure timely implementation of activities and utilization of funds within the year they are budgeted; and (b) fast track  full implementation of the uncompleted activities  for CY 2020 and utilize the remaining project funds for the intended purpose by end of CY 2021 to avoid its reversion. 

	

13)	Management was not able to fully utilize the ₱85,440,000.00 allotment received during the year for the Communicating for Perpetual End to Extreme Violence and Forming Alliance Towards Positive Change and Enriched Communities project showing unobligated allotment of ₱8,735,374.94 or 10.22 percent of the allotments due to non-implementation of five targeted activities  under “Strengthened communication strategies, capacity development and alliance-building with all sector for local peace and development” and partial implementation of one activity under the “Program Oversight”. Thus, the required outputs were not carried out/attained during the year. (Observation No. 14)

	

	We recommended that Management: (a) ensure full utilization of allotments through proper planning and timely implementation of projects/activities during the year;  and (b) fast track the procurement process to ensure that all procurement activities are within the time frame to implement programs and activities and full implementation of the remaining uncompleted activities are made.

	

14)	Inadequate planning and non-monitoring of utilization of NTF-ELCAC Funds resulted in misaligned procurements against Annual Procurement Plan (APP), splitting of government contracts amounting to ₱187,200.00 in order to avoid posting of procurements in the PhilGeps, as well as unliquidated fund transfers to field offices totaling ₱2,922,000.00, contrary to Republic Act No. 9184 and other pertinent rules and regulations.  (Observation No. 15)



	We recommended that Management: (a) comply with the rules and regulations set forth in R.A. No. 9184; (b) monitor submission of Project Procurement Management Plans (PPMPs) for consolidation in APP before the deadline set every year; (c) monitor all funds transferred to field offices to ensure alignment with program designs and request for immediate liquidation of funds upon conclusion of every activity; (d) require all PMOs to closely monitor programs assigned to their office through maintenance of reports so as to not solely rely on the Budget Officer for monitoring of their budget utilization; and (e) strictly require focal persons of all programs to prepare Activity Designs which specifies the charging and budgetary requirements per activity or as practicable.

	

15)	Due to the unimplemented planned activities, such as, procurement of equipment, drugs and medicines and the like, the Department’s utilization rate on the allotment received under the “Bayanihan to Heal as One Act” and the “Bayanihan to Recover As One Act” in the total amount of ₱3,618,600,355.00 was below 75 percent in the DILG Central Office and seven (7) ROs, resulting in unobligated allotment of ₱447,629,260.33 or 12.37 percent of the total allotment. Other deficiencies  on COVID-19 fund utilization were also observed which include: (a) allocation for  training expenses amounting to ₱6,970,000.00 utilized for the expenses of  Emergency Operations Center (EOC) which are not related to training, contrary to Section 17 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) or R.A. No. 11465 and Chapter 3 of the GAM-NGAs, Volume III; (b)  disbursements made thru cash advances amounting to ₱6,760,494.67 which contravened existing government rules and regulations on the handling and liquidation of cash advances and other standard process/procedures on disbursements, casting doubt on the validity and legitimacy of the expenditures; (c) incomplete documentation on the hiring of contact tracers; and (d) lapses in the procurement, recording  and safekeeping  of  Personnel Protective Equipment  and other medical supplies. (Observation No. 16)



We recommended that Management:  (a) explain  the causes/reasons for its inability to utilize in full the COVID- 19 allotments and see to it that   the remaining unobligated allotments are utilized in accordance with intended purposes/activities by end of June 30, 2021, to avoid its reversion to the Unappropriated Surplus of the General Fund; (b) submit basis for providing meals and snacks to personnel assigned at Emergency Operations Center using the COVID 19 funds for Training Expenses. Observe prudence in the use of government funds by strictly adhering to the pertinent government rules and regulations; (c) submit activity design for three cash advances for audit/validation purposes. See to it that granting of cash advances is completely documented in compliance with Section 1.1.3 of COA Cir. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and Section 4(6) of P.D. No. 1445; (d) strictly observe provisions of COA Circular 2004-006 which prescribes guidelines on acceptable evidence of receipt of payment for disbursements; (e) explain/justify why expenses incurred beyond the period covered by activity designs shall be allowed in audit.  Henceforth, utilize cash advances granted only for the intended purpose and within the intended date of utilization; (f) require the AO to refund excess cash advance amounting to ₱942.18; (g) direct the City Director to require the concerned contact tracers to submit lacking requirements to the Audit Team for verification/validation purposes in order to avoid audit suspension/disallowance; (h) For Region II, ensure that all resources of the government be managed and safeguarded against wastage with a view to ensuring efficiency and effectiveness in operations of government pursuant to Section 2 of P.D. 1445;  (i) For Region II, account discrepancies noted on remaining items still in the possession of the Supply Officer and submit written report thereon including list of recipients;    (j) For Region IVB, submit list of recipients indicating the names, date of actual receipt and quantity; (k) instruct the Chief Accountant to record in the appropriate inventory account all purchases of medical, dental and laboratory supplies upon acceptance of delivered items except those purchased out of the Petty Cash Fund; maintain Supplies Ledger Card for each item of inventory and record issuances to end-users upon submission by Supply Officer of the RSMI duly supported with approved Requisition and Issue Slip; and adhere to perpetual inventory method to ensure that materials issued are properly recorded and unused materials are properly accounted for; (l) instruct the Bids and Awards Committee to act promptly on procurements that are of great importance to contain or mitigate transmission of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) following Guidelines for Emergency Procurement under RA No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act; (m) require the Supply Officer to secure and safe keep PPEs from wear and tear in a well-protected place/bodega and undertake measures and safeguards to protect common medicines and other medical supplies from pilferages; and (n) For Region XI, direct the BAC or BAC Secretariat to submit justifications on delayed procurement of PPEs and other medical supplies which lead to non-distribution of the same to the hired contact tracers. 



	These observations and recommendations were brought to the attention of concerned officials of the agency in our letter dated July 16, 2021 for further comment. Management’s views and reactions were considered in the report, where appropriate.
