Dear Director Marquez: 

 

Management Letter on the Audit of the 

Construction Industry Authority of the Philippines 

for the period January 1 to December 31, 2020 

 

 

I. INTRODUCTION 
 

1. Pursuant to Section 2, Article IX-D of the Constitution of the Philippines and 
Section 43 of the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines or Presidential 

Decree (PD) No. 1445, we have conducted compliance audit on the operations and 

transactions of  the Construction Industry Authority of the Philippines (CIAP) 

for the period ended December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted in accordance 

with the International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). Those 

standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain a reasonable basis for 

our conclusions.  Financial audit was not conducted due to non-submission of the 

financial statements as at December 31, 2020. 

 

2. The audit was conducted by the audit team led by Audit Team Leader Mr. Edson 
M. Yambot to: (a) evaluate the extent of compliance with laws, rules and 

regulations as well as propriety and validity of transactions; (b) recommend 

measures to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency’s operations; 

and (c) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit 

recommendations.  

 

3. Deficiencies observed in the course of the audit were earlier communicated through 
Audit Observation Memoranda (AOMs) and discussed during the exit conference 

conducted on April 13, 2021.  Their comments on the AOMs were incorporated in 

this letter, where appropriate.  

 

4. This Management Letter is issued in lieu of the Annual Audit Report in view of the 
non-preparation and submission of the required complete set of CY 2020 Financial 



2 

 

Statements (FS) for more than 30 days after the prescribed due date of February 14, 

2020 and in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards.

6. The CIAP is mandated to promote, accelerate, and regulate the growth and 
development of the construction industry in conformity with national goals.  It has 

jurisdiction and supervision over its implementing arms namely:

policies pertaining to domestic construction resources (labor, materials, finance, 

technology, equipment, management) and government infrastructure 

management;

court dispute resolution arising from, and/or connected with government and 

private construction contracts in the Philippines; and

7. The CIAP, as an attached agency of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), is 
under the DTI Office of the Secretary (OSec). Pursuant to Department Order No. 

20-65, series of 2020, issued by DTI Secretary Ramon M. Lopez, Assistant

12. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a) replace the APR to PS and fully utilize the prior years’ balances; and 
 

b) continue monitoring the status of fund transfers to PITC. 
 

13. Copy of 28 out of 49 government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting 
documents with corresponding amount of ₱3.644 million were not submitted within 

the prescribed period, with delays ranging from two to 202 days as of year-end, thus 

prevented the audit team from reviewing the said contracts on time. However, 21 

contracts that were submitted on time were found in order. (Paragraph No. 62) 

 

14. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief of Property, 
Procurement and Supply Section to: 

 

a) submit copy of the contracts and purchase orders together with their supporting 
documents within the prescribed time as mentioned above; and 

 

b) closely monitor the timely submission of the said contracts and purchase 
orders. 

 

15. The observations and recommendations were discussed with concerned officials 
during the exit conference conducted on April 13, 2021. Their comments were 

incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

 

Enforcement of Settlement of Accounts 

 

16. Out of the ₱4.784 million suspensions and disallowances for CY 2020 and prior 
years, ₱2.633 million or 55.04 percent was settled leaving a balance of ₱2.151 

million. 

 

Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 

 

17. Of the 25 audit recommendations embodied in the prior year’s Annual Audit 
Report, four were fully implemented and twenty-one (21) were not implemented as 

of December 31, 2020, which were reiterated with modifications in this report, 

where applicable.

III. OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

A. Financial Audit 
 

Non-submission of complete Financial Statements 

 

18. The Agency’s financial condition and results of operations for CY 2020 could 
not be presented due to non-submission of a complete set of financial 

statements due to the failure of the accountant to prepare all financial 

statement and submit the same within the prescribed period. 

 

19. Section 60, Chapter 19 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I 
provides that all National Government Agencies shall prepare and submit the Trial 

Balances, Financial Statements and supporting schedules on February 14, of the 

following year. 

 

20. Moreover, Section 4.1 of COA Circular No. 2015-002 dated March 9, 2015 
enumerates the components of the Financial Statements (FS) as follows: 

 

a) Statement of Financial Position; 
b) Statement of Financial Performance; 
c) Statement of Cash Flows; 
d) Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity; 
e) Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts; and 
f) Notes to FS comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and 

other explanatory notes. 

 

21. Our records show that CIAP submitted only the Statement of Financial Position, 
Statement of Financial Performance, and Statement of Changes in Net 

Assets/Equity on March 5, 2021 and the Statement of Comparison of Budget and 

Actual Amounts on March 9, 2021 which are short of the six components of the 

Financial Statements enumerated in the abovementioned Circular.  

 

22. Due to the non-submission of the complete components of the FS, the Annual Audit 
Report on the CIAP cannot be prepared, hence, the issuance of this Management 

letter. 

 

23. We recommended that Management require the Chief Accountant to prepare 
and submit the FS in conformity with the provision of COA Circular 2015-002 

dated March 9, 2015.

B. Compliance with Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements 
 

High fund utilization/obligation rate 

 

24. Overall, the agency’s fund utilization/obligation of ₱128.714 million is 95.31 
percent compared to its appropriation/allotment of ₱135.048 million, of which 

34.390 million or 25.46 percent pertains to one of its major program, the 

Construction Industry Development Program, which registered a utilization rate of 

94.88 percent and in accordance with the purpose of appropriation/allotment. The 

unutilized fund of ₱6.334 million was due to the reduced physical/operational 

capacity due to Covid-19 pandemic resulting in a reduced consumption of office 

supplies and materials, utilities, travelling and representation expenses. 

 
High cash utilization/disbursements 

 

25. Of the total cash allocation of ₱125.789 million received during the year, 93.66 
percent or ₱117.819 million was utilized/disbursed. The balance of ₱7.970 million 

represents the unutilized notice of cash allocation due to reduced consumption of 

office supplies and materials, utilities, travelling and representation expenses and 

late billing of various contractors that was reverted to the National Treasury. Also, 

disbursements amounting to ₱32.038 million for the Construction Industry 

Development Program, were regular, necessary and not excessive, extravagant and 

unconscionable. 

 

Reversion of dormant cash, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary fund 

 

26. The agency has no dormant cash, unauthorized   accounts, unnecessary special and 
trust funds and related accounts for reversion as of year-end, in conformity with 

Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012, dated September 11, 2012, 

implementing Executive Order No. 431, dated May 30, 2005. 

 

Non-liquidation of cash advances 

 

27. Cash advances for special purpose/time-bound undertakings amounting to 
₱0.031 million or 9.60 percent of the cash advances granted during the year 

amounting to ₱0.323 million were not liquidated at the end of the year. There 

were no unliquidated cash advances in prior year. 
 

28. Section 4.1.3 (ix) of COA Circular No. 2009-002 provides that “Cash advance for 
special time-bound undertaking shall be liquidated by the accountable officer 

concerned within one month from the date the purpose of the cash advance was 

accomplished.”  

 

29. Section 4.1.3 (xi) of the same Circular also provides that “All cash advances shall 
be fully liquidated at the end of each year. Except for petty cash fund, the 

accountable officer shall refund any unexpended balance to the cashier/collecting 

officer who shall issue the necessary official receipt.”

30. The cash advances to special disbursing officers as of year-end has a balance of 
₱0.031 million as shown in the table below:

% of Total 100.00 100.00 90.40 100.00 9.60 - 

  

31. The cash advances during the year were properly granted to the accountable officer, 
however, the amount of ₱0.130 million that was granted to the special disbursing 

officer on December 17, 2020 for the conduct of the CIAP One day Virtual Team 

Building Activities held on December 18, 2020 was not fully liquidated as of year-

end because the supplier issued the Official Receipt on January 4, 2021 only after 

validating the cash deposit made by CIAP on December 28, 2020. The remaining 

balance was refunded on January 6, 2021, hence, the ₱0.031 million was liquidated 

during CY 2021 contrary to the abovementioned circular. 

 

32. We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the accountable officer 
to prepare all supporting documents in relation to the cash advance before 

year-end and liquidate all outstanding cash advances as of year-end. 

 

Granting and liquidation of fund transfers to implementing agencies and NGOs/POs 

 

33. There were no funds transferred to National Government Agencies (NGAs), Local 
Government Units (LGUs), Government Owned and Controlled Corporations 

(GOCCs) and Non-Government Organizations/People’s Organizations (NGOs/POs) 

during the year and prior years. 

 

Non-liquidation of fund transfers to PS-DBM and PITC  

 

34. Fund transfers to Procurement Service – Department of Budget and 
Management (PS-DBM) for its office supplies and equipment requirement 

during the year amounting to ₱0.981 million  or 29.66 percent of the funds 

transferred of  ₱3.307 million were not liquidated. Also, there were still 

unliquidated fund transfers to PS-DBM and Philippine International Trade 

Center (PITC) in prior years amounting to ₱5.689 million or 72.74 percent of 

prior years’ balance of ₱7.821 million.  

 

35. Section 4.6 of COA Circular No 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 provides that 
within ten days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, 



8 

 

the Implementing Agencies (IAs) shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) 

and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds. Only 

actual project expenses shall be reported. The reports shall be approved by the Head 

of the IA. 

 

36. Section 4.9 of the same Circular states that the IA shall return to the Source Agency 
(SA) any unused balance upon completion of the project. 

 

37. The fund transfers to PS-DBM and PITC and corresponding liquidations are shown 
below:

38. During the year, ₱3.307 million was transferred to Procurement Service for the 
purchase of office supplies and equipment and ₱2.326 or 70.34 percent was 

liquidated, leaving a balance of ₱0.981 million or 29.66 percent. The beginning 

balance of fund transfer from prior years amounted to ₱4.485 million and ₱2.132 

million or 47.54 percent was liquidated, leaving a balance of ₱2.353 or 52.46 

percent. The percentage of liquidation for the current year is higher than the 

percentage of liquidation of the prior years. 

 

39. The unliquidated amount pertains to undelivered goods that were unavailable at the 
time of the receipt of Agency Procurement Request (APR) by the PS-DBM but the 

agency may issue a supplemental APR to replace all unavailable stocks to another 

common-use supplies that is currently available on stock. 

 

40. The undelivered goods from PS-DBM deprived the agency of its timely use of the 
items necessary in its operations. 

 

41. Moreover, the balance of fund transfers to PITC for the procurement of PABX 
telephone system and motor vehicles of the agency amounting to ₱3.336 million 

that were transferred on December 28, 2018, remained unliquidated as of year-end. 

 

42. The delivery of the said PABX telephone system and motor vehicles during CY 
2020 did not materialize because no bidder participated in the public bidding 

conducted by PITC. 

 

43. The agency already revised the Agency Outsourcing Request (AOR) to attract 
prospective bidders and is closely monitoring the status of the fund transfer. 



9 

 

 

44. The undelivered goods and services from PITC deprived the agency of its timely 
use of the items necessary in its operations. 

 

45. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a) replace the APR to PS and fully utilize the prior years’ balances; and 
 

b) continue monitoring the status of fund transfers to PITC. 
 

Dormant receivable accounts not requested for write-off 

 

46. Dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and other 
receivables amounting to ₱1.073 million were not requested for write-off.  

 

47. Section 8.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 provides that “The Head of the 
government entity shall file the request for authority to write-off dormant receivable 

accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfer to the COA Audit Team 

Leader (ATL) and/or Supervising Auditor (SA).” 

 

48. Moreover, Section 5.4 of the same circular provides that “Dormant Account 
Receivable Accounts – accounts which balances remained inactive or non-moving 

in the books of accounts for ten (10) years or more and where 

settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.” 

 

49. The status of receivables, showing the dormant accounts are presented in the table

50. The amount of ₱1.073 million remained inactive or non-moving in the books of 
accounts for more than ten (10) years, hence, settlement or collectability could no 

longer be ascertained. 

 

51. The Accountant commented that demand letters were already sent to the 
trainees/beneficiaries of “train now pay later” that has available records but the 

letters were returned since the persons cannot be found. 

 

52. In addition, the Accountant also commented that they will prepare the necessary 
documents and request the write-off of these dormant accounts. 

 

53. We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant to 
prepare the necessary documents for the request to write off the dormant 

accounts as required in COA Circular No. 2016-005. 

 

Insurance of physical assets with the GSIS   

 

54. The agency insured with the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) 
property amounting to ₱52.624 million with corresponding insurance premiums 

paid in the amount of ₱0.302 million, in accordance with RA No. 656, otherwise 

known as the “Property Insurance Law” as amended by Presidential Decree (PD) 

No. 245 dated July 13, 1973. 

 

Non-disposal of unserviceable property 

 

55. Unserviceable property with total cost of ₱1.176 million remained not disposed 
of due to non-establishment of disposal committee, thus exposing them to 

further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value. 
 

56. Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides that “When government property has become 
unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the 

officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly 

authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to 

be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be 

valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the 



11 

 

supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in the presence of the 

auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the Commission.” 

 

57. The Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) is a report 
prepared by the Supply and/or Property Unit as basis to record dropping from the 

books the unserviceable property carried in the PPE accounts. When the property is 

sold, the record of sales shall be accomplished. The IIRUP shall be submitted to the 

Accounting Division after the disposal is completed. 

 

58. The IIRUP for CY 2019 disclosed unserviceable property amounting to ₱1.176 
million pertaining to Other Property, Plant and Equipment. The Chief of 

Administrative, Financial and Management Division (AFMD) explained that due to 

Covid – 19 pandemic which brought about the enforcement of ECQ, MECQ and 

GCQ regulations nationwide, not much was done with respect to the disposal of the 

unserviceable equipment. Moreover, the Chairman of the disposal committee died 

during the year and another member of the committee resigned effective December 

31, 2020, hence, the reconstitution of the Disposal Committee is necessary in order 

to continue the disposal of the property.    

 

59. The non-disposal thereof resulted in prolonged exposure which further deteriorated 
or decreased their realizable value. 

 

60. We recommended and Management agreed to immediately reconstitute a 
disposal committee to handle the disposal of unserviceable property to prevent 

further deterioration or decrease their realizable value. 
 

Emergency Procurement Activities During a State of Calamity 

 

61. The agency did not conduct an emergency procurement under RA No. 11469, also 
known as the “The Bayanihan to Heal as One Act”.  

 

Delayed submission of government contracts  

 

62. Copy of 28 out of 49 government contracts, purchase orders and their 
supporting documents with corresponding amount of ₱3.644 million were not 

submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from two to 202 

days as of year-end, thus prevented the audit team from reviewing the said 

contracts on time. However, 21 contracts were submitted on time and were 

found in order. 
 

63. Item 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 provides that 
the copy of approved contracts (Contract Agreement, Memorandum of Agreement, 

Job Order, Consultancy Contract, etc.) should be submitted within five (5) working 

days from the execution thereof. 

 



12 

 

64. Moreover, item 3.2.1 of the same COA Circular provides that a copy of any 
purchase order irrespective of amount, and each supporting document, shall, within 

five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor. 

 

65. Audit disclosed that eighteen (18) contracts and ten (10) POs amounting to ₱2.945 
million and ₱0.699 million, respectively, or a total amount of ₱3.644 million were 

not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from two to 202 

days.

66. It was observed that contracts and POs were only submitted to COA together with 
the Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR) by the Property, Procurement and 

Supply Section within 24 hours of delivery of the goods indicated in the contracts 

or POs.  However, this procedure is not enough to comply with the abovementioned 

circular because the circular pertains to the contracts or POs within 5 days of 

execution while the submission of IAR is required within 24 hours of delivery of 

the goods and services to the agency. 

 

67. The delayed submission of contracts and POs and pertinent documents within the 
required period precluded the audit team in the timely auditorial review. 

Nonetheless, all contracts that were submitted were found in order. 

 

68. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief of Property, 
Procurement and Supply Section to: 

 

a) submit copy of the contracts and purchase orders together with their 
supporting documents within the prescribed time as mentioned above; and 

 

b) closely monitor the timely submission of the said contracts and purchase 

orders.

Non-proper withholding of GSIS contributions and loans  

 

69. The agency withheld the amount of ₱5.592 million for the employee’s monthly 
premiums and loan payments for the year and remitted the amount of ₱6.781 

million within the prescribed period. However, the total remittance was not the  

full amount of the total amount withheld that resulted in the unremitted 

balance of ₱0.163 million as of year-end. 
 

70. RA No. 8291, otherwise known as the “Government Service Insurance System Act 
of 1997,” provides that the rate of contribution payable by the member and 

government agency shall be 9 percent and 12 percent, respectively, based on the 

actual monthly salary of the member. 

 

71. Section 14.1, Rule III of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA No. 8291 
provides that “Each government agency shall remit directly to the GSIS the 

employees’ and government agency’s contributions within the first ten (10) days of 

the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply. The 

remittance by the government agency of the contributions to the GSIS shall take 

priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations except salaries and 

wages of its employees.” 

 

72. For the current year, the agency had withheld the amount of ₱5.592 million for 
employee’s monthly premiums and loan payments, and remitted the amount of 

₱6.781 million within the prescribed period as shown in the table below:

73. However, the amount withheld monthly was not remitted intact resulting in 
unremitted balance of ₱0.012 at the end of the year; thus, increasing the balance to 

₱0.163 million.  

 

74. The accountant commented that the amount remitted is less than the total amount 
withheld due to the non-acceptance of GSIS of any amount exceeding their monthly 

billing. The discrepancies are from the database of GSIS that does not include 

newly hired employees, salary adjustment, and other circumstances. 

 

75. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 
 

a. remit the exact amount that was previously withheld to GSIS or refund the 
excess amount immediately if there was any; and 

 

b. prepare a schedule for the unremitted balance of ₱0.163 million and 
conduct a reconciliation with GSIS and remit or refund the balance as the 

case may be. 
 

Delayed remittance of PhilHealth contributions  

 

76. The agency failed to remit within the deadlines both the employee and 
employer shares amounting to ₱0.317 million, with delay ranging from 5 to 60 

days.  
 

77. PhilHealth Circular No, 0001 S. 2014 dated January 9, 2014 provides that: 
 

Existing New Payment Deadlines

Every 16th – 20th day of the month 

following the applicable period 

 

78. The PhilHealth Employer Number (PEN) of CIAP is 141274000002, thus, the 
deadline would be at every 11th to 15th day of the month following the applicable 

period.  

 

79. The remittance of PhilHealth contribution of the agency with delay ranging from 5 
to 60 days are shown in the table below:

80. The monthly contributions of the employees that were previously withheld against 
their salary together with the employer share that was required by law was not 

remitted on time contrary to the abovementioned PhilHealth Circular. 

 

81. The Accountant commented that they remitted the PhilHealth contribution thru List 
of Due and Demandable Accounts Payable – Advice to Debit Accounts (LDDAP-

ADA) and that date reflected in the Official Receipt of PhilHealth pertains to the 

date when the copy of the validated LDDAP-ADA was furnished to PhilHealth that 

is usually beyond the prescribed deadline although the actual amount was already 

transferred in the account of PhilHealth in an earlier date.  

 

82. We recommended and Management agreed to furnish immediately the 
PhilHealth the copy of the validated LDDAP-ADA so that an Official Receipt 

will be issued on time. 
 

Non-proper withholding of Pag-IBIG contributions and loans  

 

83. The agency failed to remit the employee share and payment of loans and 
employer share amounting to ₱.049 million, ₱0.053 million and ₱0.009 million, 

respectively, thus the employees were deprived of the benefits derived from 

their monthly contributions. 
 

84. Section 23 of RA No. 9679 known as the “Home Development Mutual Fund Law 
of 2009” provides that “It shall be the duty of every employer, private or public, to 

set aside and remit the contributions required under this Act in accordance with a 

mechanism determined by the Board of Trustees.” 

 

85. As of year-end, the agency failed to remit the employee share, payment of loans and 
employer share for the month of May 2020 amounting to ₱0.049 million, ₱0.053 

million, and ₱0.009 million, respectively.  

 

86. The employees were deprived of the benefits derived from their monthly 
contributions and loan payments that were previously withheld against their salaries 

together with the employer share that was required by law. 



16 

 

87. The accountant commented that the delay was due to the pandemic causing various 
work suspension or lockdown during the year and the reduced number of personnel 

allowed to go to the workplace to maintain social distancing. 

 

88. However, Pag-IBIG did not accept the late payment for the month of May without 
imposing a penalty despite the request of the accountant to waive the said penalty, 

hence, the remittance was not accepted during the year. 

 

89. Moreover, the contributions were already remitted during CY 2021. 
 

90. We recommended and Management agreed that the alternative working 
arrangement of the employees should not delay the mandatory remittances to 

Pag-IBIG. 
 

Non-proper withholding and remittance of taxes 
 

91. The agency withheld the amount of ₱10.067 million from employee’s 
compensation, payment of goods and services, and remitted the amount of 

₱9.945 million within the prescribed period. However, the monthly remittance 

was not the same as the monthly withheld that resulted in the unremitted 

balance of ₱0.068 million from the period of January to November 2020. 
 

92. Section B. 3 of Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 23-2012 dated February 2014 
provides that “To withhold the correct amount of tax. Based on the office’s 

registration and where applicable, the government withholding tax on 

compensation (WTC), on income payments subject to expanded withholding tax 

(EWT) and final withholding tax (FWT) and on government money payment to VAT 

registered taxpayer (GVAT) and Non-VAT registered taxpayers subject to 

percentage tax (GPT) pursuant to section 80(A), 57 and 114, all of the Tax Code.” 

 

93. The agency withheld the amount of ₱10.067 million from employee’s 
compensation, payment of goods and services, and remitted the amount of ₱9.945 

million within the prescribed period.  Details shown as follows:

94. However, the monthly remittances made by the agency is less than the total of the 
monthly withheld amount that resulted in the increase of the unremitted balance of 

₱0.068 million. 

 

95. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 
 

a) remit the exact amount that was previously withheld to BIR or refund the 
excess amount immediately if there was any; and 

 

b) prepare a schedule for the unremitted balance of ₱0.068 million and remit 
or refund the amount as the case may be. 

 

Hiring of and payments to job orders, contractual and consultants 

 

96. The CIAP hired 53 Contract of Service (COS) individuals as of December 31, 2020 
on a semestral basis, in accordance with CSC COA DBM Joint Circular No. 1 dated 

June 15, 2017, as updated by CSC COA DBM Joint Circular No. 2, s 2020, dated 

October 20, 2020, to augment the regular plantilla employees of 81, due to unfilled 

positions. Their salaries were charged against Maintenance and Other Operating 

Expenses (MOOE) in the total amount of ₱16.915 million, as authorized under 

DBM Circular Letter (CL) No. 2013-5 dated July 22, 2013. 
 

Non-approval of GAD Plan and Budget 
 

97. The agency failed to obtain the endorsement/approval of Philippine 
Commission on Women (PCW) on their GPB CY 2020, contrary to item V of 

COA Circular 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014, due to the failure of the 

designated focal persons to submit the necessary documents within the 

prescribed period which prevented the audit team from validating the 

compliance of the agency with Section 31 of R.A. No. 11465, also known as the 

General Appropriation Act of 2020. 
 

98. Section 31 of RA No. 11465   provides that “All Agencies of the government shall 
formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender 

issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable 

provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on 

Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform 



18 

 

for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) 

and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).” 

 

99. As required under the law, the agency formulated a Gender and Development Plan. 
However, the duly approved GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for CY 2020 were not 

submitted to COA, which is contrary to the provision of item V of the COA 

Circular 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014, which states that “The Audited agency 

shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit 

team assigned to the agency within five working days from the receipt of the 

approved plan from PCW or their mother or central offices, as the case may be.” 

 

100. The agency failed to obtain the endorsement of the Philippine Commission on 
Women, the agency tasked to review the GPBs of government agencies. 

Confirmation with PCW’s Information Communication Technology Section 

revealed that on November 14, 2019, PCW informed CIAP through Gender 

Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) to revise their GPB but the agency 

failed to revise the same resulting in the non-endorsement of the GPB. 

 

101. The Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) registered user of CIAP 
averred that during 2019 she was re-assigned to another position and that she was 

not able to monitor the account due to her new assignment and thinking that the 

newly designated focal person will continue or assign a new employee to monitor 

the GMMS account of the agency. Hence, the audit team was prevented from 

validating the compliance of the agency with the RA No. 11465. 

 

102. We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the newly designated 
GAD Focal person to strictly monitor the submission of the GPB to PCW and 

conduct proper turnover of duties and responsibilities every time an employee 

is reassigned to another position who has access to the GMMS.  

 

Non-submission of Plan, Programs and Projects related to SCPD 

 

103. The agency failed to submit the plan, programs and projects related to SCPD 
(Senior Citizen and Person with Disability) together with the actual 

accomplishment, contrary to Section 32 of RA No. 11465, also known as the 

General Appropriation Act of 2020 due to the failure of the focal person to 

submit the necessary documents which prevented the audit team from 

validating the compliance of the agency with the said law. 
 

104. The plan, programs and projects related to SCPD together with the actual 
accomplishment of the agency was not submitted to the audit team by the concerned 

Focal Person, contrary to Section 32 of RA No. 11465, also known as the 

Government Appropriation Act of  2020 which provides that “All agencies of the 

government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the 

concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it    relates to 

their mandated functions, and integrate the same to their regular    activities.” 



19 

 

105. The plan, programs and projects for CY 2020 and the accomplishment as of   
December 31, 2020 was not submitted to the audit team, due to the failure of the 

designated focal person to prepare the necessary documents. Hence, the audit team 

was prevented from validating the compliance of the agency with RA No. 11465 

pertaining to its plan, programs and projects on to SCPD; and the budget utilization 

of the agency could not be ascertained/measured due to the absence of the 

accomplishment report.  

 

106. The Chief of AFMD explained that the focal person of SCPD was a kidney patient 
undergoing dialysis at least thrice a week and currently working from home, hence, 

the non-preparation of the report. 

 

107. We recommended and Management agreed to replace the focal person who 
cannot physically come to work due to health restriction and submit the plans, 

programs and projects together with the accomplishment reports. 
 

Implementation of ODA Funded Projects  

 

108. The agency did not receive and disburse funds for Official Development Assistance 
(ODA) for this year and prior years. 

 

Receipt and utilization of Disaster Related Fund  

 

109. The agency did not receive and disburse funds for Disaster Risk Reduction 
Management Fund and/or Quick Response Fund for this year and prior years.  

 

Audit suspensions, disallowances and charges 

 

110. Notice of Suspensions (NSs) were issued for transactions audited during the 
year amounted to ₱0.212 million due to non-submission of various documents 

and no Notice of Disallowances (NDs) was issued during the year. Moreover, 

all outstanding NSs were settled during the year amounting to ₱2.590 million 

and ₱0.043 million was settled for prior year’s NDs with corresponding Notice 

of Settlement Suspension, Disallowance and Charge (NSSDC) issued during 

the year, leaving unsettled disallowances amounting to ₱2.151 million as of the 

end of the year. 

 

111. Section 9.4 of Chapter III of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of 
Accounts provides that “A suspension should be settled within ninety (90) calendar 

days from receipt of the NS; otherwise the transaction covered by it shall be 

disallowed/charged after the Auditor shall have satisfied himself that such action is 

appropriate. Consequently, the Auditor shall issue the corresponding ND/NC.” 

 

112. Section 10.4 of Chapter III of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of 
Accounts provides that “The disallowance shall be settled within six (6) months 

from receipt of the ND by the persons liable.”

117. Moreover, audit disallowances issued prior to the effectivity of COA Circular No.

Regulations on Settlement of Accounts) provides that “The suspensions,

disallowances, and charges existing at the effectivity of these Rules shall continue 

to be monitored and enforced by this Commission.” 

 

119. Management commented that the persons liable for NDs still outstanding as of 
year-end and issued prior to the effectivity of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated 

September 15, 2009, were not connected with the agency anymore, hence, 

enforcing settlement of the said disallowance is difficult.   

 

120. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a) continuously deduct from the salaries of the persons liable the amount of 
monthly installment approved by COA to fully settle their liability; and 

  

b) initiate the necessary actions to enforce settlement of audit disallowances 
prior to the effectivity of COA Circular No. 2009-006. 

 

Covid-19 related expenses that was charge to regular funds 

 

121. The agency spent ₱0.837 million directly related to the mitigation and containment
