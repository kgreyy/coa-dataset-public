DETAILED OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

				

A)					FINANCIAL AND COMPLIANCE 

				

1)	The accuracy and existence of the recorded balances of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts with a total net book value of ₱396,487,241.37 (excluding Construction-in-Progress account) is doubtful due to a) non-provision of depreciation expense on PPEs with total book value of ₱150,278,200.53; b) non-maintenance of PPE Ledger Cards (PPELC) and Property Cards (PC) for each category of PPE; and c) discrepancy between the accounting records and the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) totaling ₱1,952,623.77, contrary to Sections 27 and 42, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I.



Section 27, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, states that “PPE gradually loses its ability to provide service over the course of time. Because of this, its cost needs to be distributed on a systematic basis over its useful life.   The allocated cost is referred to as “depreciation”.  Further, it states that “Except for land and not recognized heritage assets, all PPE shall be depreciated.”



Section 42, Chapter 10, Volume I, of the same Manual also provides that, “The Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock, etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like PAR.”



The Statement of Financial Position of the University as of December 31, 2020 reflected a total asset balance of ₱722,919,763.85. Of this total amount, ₱396,487,241.37 or approximately 54.85 percent pertains to various Property, Plant and Equipment accounts (net of accumulated depreciation and excluding Construction-in-Progress) as shown in the table below.

The failure of the University to provide depreciation on these assets during the year resulted in the overstatement of both the asset and equity accounts equivalent to the amount of depreciation that should have been provided, thus affecting the fair presentation of said accounts in the financial statements at year-end.



Moreover, comparison of the recorded PPEs (excluding Construction-in-Progress) with total book value of ₱455,011,963.14 against the submitted RPCPPE as of year-end disclosed a net discrepancy of ₱1,952,623.77 thus, rendered the balance of the PPE accounts at year-end unreliable.

		It was noted that PPE Ledger Cards and Property Cards were not maintained and/or updated by the Accounting and Property Unit, respectively. Further verification also disclosed that no reconciliation between the balances per accounting records and RPCPPE was made which defeats the very purpose of inventory-taking.

		

		Physical inventory taking is necessary to check the existence, condition and accuracy of the PPE and inventories. The process also aids in determining the status of the Agency assets and identify items that are obsolete and unserviceable in order to present the accurate value of the PPE in the financial statements. Another purpose of inventory-taking is to reconcile the balances of both the accounting and property records because it is only when the inventory report of PPE accounts are reconciled with the accounting records can the balances of these accounts be considered reliable.

		

		Inquiry from the Accounting personnel in-charge on the recording and monitoring of PPE accounts disclosed that they were not able to provide depreciation on some depreciable assets due to the absence of subsidiary ledgers and non-maintenance of PPE ledger cards with the details such as the cost and date of acquisition necessary in the computation of depreciation. It was also explained by the Property personnel that no reconciliation of the submitted RPCPPE to the accounting records was made due to time constraints. 

		

		We recommended and Management agreed that the University President instruct the:

	

a)		Accountant to exhaust possible means to determine the costs and dates of acquisition of the PPE and provide for their depreciation using the straight-line method of depreciation and record in the books in compliance with Section 27, Chapter 10, of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, in order to present fairly the values of the PPE and equity accounts in the financial statements; and

	

b)		Accountant and the OIC-Supply and Property Officer to (i) maintain a complete and updated PPELCs and PCs, respectively, pursuant to Section 42, Chapter 10 of the same Manual, to record the necessary information of the specific PPE accounts; and (ii) reconcile both the Accounting and Property records and make necessary adjustments for any discrepancy/ies noted to reflect the accurate values of PPE accounts in the financial statements.





2)	The accuracy of the reported year-end balance of Cash - Modified Disbursement System (MDS), Regular of ₱0.00 was unreliable due to the failure of the Accountant to prepare and submit monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS).  As a result, the discrepancy of ₱3,084,375.77 between the book and bank balances as at year-end was not reconciled.  Likewise, the balance of Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account (LCCA) of ₱183,418,849.35 is doubtful as reconciling items and/or errors of ₱801,944.73 remained unadjusted in the books, contrary to pertinent Sections of Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, thus, affecting the fair presentation of the Cash accounts in the financial statements. 



Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, covers the preparation of the bank reconciliation statements for “Cash in Bank’ and “Cash – Modified Disbursement System (MDS) accounts including the proposed adjusting entries.



The following pertinent Sections in the said manual must be observed.



Section 3. Objectives. The Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) shall be prepared in order to:



a)			check correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s/entity’s records;

b)			serve as a deterrent to fraud; and

c)			enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or credits recognized by the bank or agency/entity but not yet known to the agency/entity or bank.



Section 4. Method of Bank Reconciliation. The monthly BRS shall be prepared by the Chief Accountant/designated staff for each of the bank accounts maintained by the agency/entity using the Adjusted Balance Method. Under this method, the book balance and the bank balance are brought to an adjusted cash balance that must appear on the Statement of Financial Position. (Underscoring ours)



Section 5. Preparation of the Bank Reconciliation Statement. The Chief Accountant/ Designated Staff shall within ten days from the receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/ Credit Memoranda (CM) form the GSB, reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the BRS in four copies.



Section 6. Recognition of Adjustments. The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall prepare a JEV to recognize all reconciling items that require adjustments and correction in the book of accounts. (Underscoring ours)



Section 7. Reporting. The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty days after receipt of the monthly Bank Statements xxx.



The University’s Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020, showed the balance of Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account (CIB – LCCA) and Cash - Modified Disbursement System (MDS) - Regular of ₱183,413,849.35 and ₱0.00, respectively, as shown in the table below.

	One of the control procedures to establish the correctness of Cash in Bank balances is the preparation of monthly bank reconciliation statements. This procedure is required in order to bring cash accounts and its affected accounts to its correct book balance on a regular basis.

	

	Records show that the Accountant failed to prepare Bank Reconciliation Statements for LBP Account Nos. 1162-1002-18 and 2116-9001-33 for the month of December 2020, contrary to Sections 5 and 7, Chapter 21 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

	

	Based on bank confirmation, LBP Account Nos. 1162-1002-18 and 2116-9001-33 have balances as of December 31, 2020 of P33,892.47 and ₱3,084,375.77, respectively. Comparison with the book balances, the latter LBP Account has a discrepancy of ₱3,084,375.77.  

	

	Examination of submitted BRS for the other bank accounts maintained by the University disclosed several reconciling items and/or errors detected amounting to ₱801,944.73 that remained unadjusted in the books inconsistent with Section 6, Chapter 21 of the Manual. Details are shown in the table next page.

The timely preparation and submission of a bank reconciliation statement serves as an effective control in the efficient management of agency’s cash accounts. On the contrary, late preparation of bank reconciliation statements diminishes its informative value to agency’s decision-makers and stakeholders.



It was explained that the late receipt of bank statements from the depository bank was the main reason for the non-preparation of BRS.



Notwithstanding the failure of the Bank to furnish the agency with monthly bank statements, the management should have adopted alternative courses of action to check the correctness of the reported cash in bank balances such as requesting for snapshots bank statements from the bank, availing of the weAccess and eMDS facilities, among others.



Non-preparation of bank reconciliation statements and failure of the Accountant to adjust the errors/ reconciling items in the books of accounts as of year-end rendered the reported balances of Cash in Bank accounts unreliable. It is only when both the book and bank records are reconciled that the reported cash in bank balances are rendered accurate and reliable.



We recommended and Management agreed to: 



a)	avail of the service facilities – weAccess and eMDS – of Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) to enable to obtain the necessary electronic data in preparing the monthly bank reconciliation statements so that errors/omissions, if any, are immediately detected for correction and adjustment in the books of accounts to ensure that Cash in Bank account balances are correctly presented in the financial statements; and 



b)	ensure compliance with pertinent sections of Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, Volume I, in the preparation and reporting of Bank Reconciliation Statements.

		

		

3)	Unliquidated cash advances (CA) accumulated to ₱4,675,282.74 as of December 31, 2020 due to non-observance of existing rules and regulations on the grant, utilization and liquidation of CA prescribed under COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 thus, overstated the receivables and understated the expenses/surplus accounts equivalent to the amounts already expended, if any.  Moreso, it also exposed the government funds to risk of possible loss and misappropriation.



Section 4.1.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides the general guidelines on the granting and utilization of cash advances which include, among others, the following:



--	No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.



--	A cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served. 



Section 5.1 of the same Circular also provides the specific time frames for the liquidation of cash advances as follows:



5.1.1   Salaries, Wages, etc. - within five (5) days after each fifteen (15) day/end of the month pay period. 

5.1.2 	Petty Operating Expenses and Field Operating Expenses - within twenty (20) days after the end of the year; subject to replenishment as frequently as necessary during the year. 

	5.1.3   Official Travel - within sixty (60) days after return to the Philippines in the case of foreign travel or within thirty (30) days after return to his permanent official station in the case of local travel, as provided for in EO 248 and COA Circular No. 96-004. 

Section 5.8 of the said Circular also requires all cash advances to be fully liquidated at the end of each year.  Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary receipt.



Verification of cash advances showed that unliquidated cash advances amounted to ₱4,675,282.74 as of year-end, composed of the following:

Records also show that additional cash advances were granted to AOs for the payment of salaries although previous cash advances were not yet liquidated which resulted to the accumulation of unliquidated cash advances for payroll as shown in Annex B. Management justified that additional cash advances were granted to AOs in order not to delay/hamper the payment of salaries and wages in the succeeding payroll period. 



The failure of Management to monitor and/or enforce the immediate settlement/liquidation of cash advances is contrary to Section 5 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997.











We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)		direct the concerned accountable officers and employees to settle/liquidate immediately all outstanding cash advances at year-end.  In case of failure, cause the withholding of any money due them and institute appropriate administrative proceedings and enforce sanctions against them, if warranted; and

	

b)		undertake measures to strictly adhere to pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 on the grant and liquidation of cash advances.





4)	Insurable properties of the University amounting to ₱323,714,118.91 were not covered by insurance under the GSIS due to non-submission of Property Inventory Form by the Inventory Committee and non-payment of premiums for the year contrary to the pertinent provision of RA 656 and COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018thus, deprived the University of adequate protection against any damage to or loss of properties or assets due to fire, earthquake, storm or other calamities.

			

Section 5 of Republic Act No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law, provides that “Every government, except a municipal government below first class, is hereby required to insure its properties, with the Fund against any insurable risk herein provided and pay premiums thereon, which, however, shall not exceed the premiums charged by private insurance companies: Provided, however, That the System reserves the right to disapprove the whole or a portion of the amount of insurance applied for: Provided, further, That such property or part thereof as may not be insurable or acceptable for insurance may be insured with any private insurance company. Xxx”



Section 6. Collection and payment of premiums. – (a) In accordance with such rules and regulations as the System may prescribe under section three of this Act, the premiums on insurance under section five hereof shall be paid in advance to the System by the government concerned. (b) Penalties. – Any cashier, treasurer, or any government official responsible for the collection and/or remittance of the premiums hereinabove prescribed, who refuses or habitually neglects to comply with the instructions of the System and to collect or accept payments of the said premiums, issue receipts therefor, and/or remit the same within the time prescribed by the System, shall be held liable for the payment of said premiums and shall pay to the System a fine of two per centum per month of said premiums from their due dates until received by the System.



Verification of records and inquiry with concerned University personnel disclosed that the agency received Insurance Billing dated February 24, 2020 from GSIS Batangas Branch with a total amount of ₱503,681.56 representing renewal premiums on various buildings and other structures of the University for the year, as shown in the following table.

	*Detailed list of Buildings and Other Structures shown in Annex C

		

	Review of the University’s Statement of Financial Performance for CY 2020, disclosed that there was no Insurance Expenses account used for payment, if any, of insurance premiums on insurable properties of the University for the year.  However, documents show that a check was drawn in the name of GSIS under LBP check number 560897 dated March 20, 2020 amounting to ₱468,423.85, net of tax. According to the University Cashier, the said check was not delivered to the GSIS, Batangas City Branch, due to the travel restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic until it became stale. On July 31, 2020, the Accountant prepared a Journal Entry Voucher to take up the staled check, by debiting Cash in Bank account and crediting Insurance Expense account of the same amount of ₱468,423.85. Based on the entry made, the Accountant did not set up liability for the unpaid insurance premium, thus at year end, no insurance expense or payable was recognized.

	

	It was also observed that only Buildings and Other Structures totaling ₱69,360,000.00 are covered with insurance per GSIS billing dated February 24, 2020. (Annex C)

	

	Based on the Statement of Financial Position, the insurable Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) of the University at the beginning of the year amounted to ₱323,714,188.91, net of depreciation as shown in the table below.

	Hence, other insurable properties amounting to ₱254,354,118.91 owned by the University were not insured with the GIF, GSIS.

	

	Under COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018, heads of government agencies are required to direct the pertinent official under his/her supervision to secure directly from GSIS GFF, all insurances or bonds covering properties, contracts, rights of action and other insurable risk of their respective officer,  prepare Property Inventory Form (PIF) listing of all the insurable properties and other assets and submit the PIF to the Supervising Auditor/Team Leader and the GIF, GSIS, not later than April 30 of each .

	

	Section 4.1 of the said circular expressly defined that property includes vessels and craft, motor vehicles, machineries, permanent buildings, properties stored therein (i.e., furniture, fixtures, equipment, supplies and materials, etc.) or in buildings rented by the government, or properties in transit, the ownership of which had already passed to the government.

	

	The failure of the concerned University officials to prepare and submit the updated Property Inventory for CY 2020 to the GSIS resulted in the non-inclusion of other insurable properties in the assessed insurance premiums and in the University’s annual budget or allocated funds for the GSIS general insurance coverage premiums in CY 2020. 

	

	The non-payment of insurance premium denies the University of protection against damage to or loss of its properties or assets due to fire, earthquake, storm or other fortuitous events.  It also deprives the GSIS of income that should have formed part of the GIF. 



 We recommended and Management agreed that the University President ensure to strictly comply with Sections 5 and 6 of Republic Act No. 656 and COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 on insurance coverage over all insurable properties of the University.





5)	Twenty-nine (29) parcels of land, acquired through purchase or donation by the University with a total cost/market value of ₱34,975,656.45 were not yet covered with Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) in the name of the University contrary to Sections 39 and 63 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, thus the interest of the government was not fully protected.



Section 39 of P.D. No 1445 specifically provides that “In case of deeds to property purchased by any government agency, the Commission shall require a certificate of title entered into in favor of the government or other evidence satisfactory to it that the title is in the government. xxx”



Section 63 of the said decree states that “Except as may otherwise be specifically provided by law or competent authority all moneys and property officially received by a public officer in any capacity or upon any occasion must be accounted for as government funds and government property. Government property shall be taken up in the books of the agency concerned at acquisition cost or an appraised value.” 



Review and examination of the submitted documents, such as Deed of Absolute Sale, Deed of Donation and Tax Declaration of real property disclosed that all 29 parcels of land, acquired through purchase or donation by the University with a total cost/market value of ₱34,975,656.45 were not yet covered with Transfer Certificate of Title in the name of the University, as follows:

	            **Tax Declaration on the donated land (part) not submitted (Deed of Donation, reference)

	        *** No Deed of Absolute Sale submitted for reference of purchase price

		

		The table above showed that all 29 parcels of land, six acquired thru purchase and 23 acquired thru donation, have no Transfer Certificate of Title to prove the ownership of the same. Nevertheless, the OIC – Supply and Property Management Officer provided 22 Tax Declarations, however, eight Tax Declarations were not in the name of the University.

		

		While it can be argued that the deed of absolute sale and actual possession of the land are conclusive evidence of ownership, the interest of the University is not fully protected until the Transfer Certificate Title/ Certificate of Land Title is issued by the Registry of Deeds in order to prevent possible conflicts. 

	

	Inquiry with the Accounting and the Supply and Property Management Units revealed that the non-maintenance of Land Ledger Card and non-preparation of Report on the Physical Count on Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) in previous years contributed on the lapses in the updated record of Land account and hindered the registration/transfer of lands in favor of the University.  

	

	The non-registration or non-transfer of the land title in the name of the University exposes the University’s absolute ownership from possible third-party claims. 

	

	We recommended and Management agreed that the University President:

a)	direct the Property Officer to facilitate the registration and transfer of title of the lands in the name of the University, whether acquired through purchase or donation to protect the interest of the University in compliance with Sections 39 and 63 of Presidential Decree No. 1445;

b)	create an appraisal committee to come up with the appraised value of the lands, in case of acquisitions by donation, as the basis for the recording thereof; and 

c)	instruct the University Accountant and the Property Officer to maintain subsidiary ledger and property cards, respectively, for each land/property with all the necessary information relative thereto.





6)	Registration and/or renewal with the Land Transportation Office (LTO) of 19 units of serviceable motor vehicles of the University for CY 2020 were delayed ranging from four to 208 months, contrary to Section 5 of Batas Pambansa Bilang 74 thus, exposing the University to unnecessary payment of penalties for late registration/renewal and/or damages in case of accidents arising from the use of the vehicles. Moreover, 18 units of serviceable motor vehicles of the University do not bear the required markings for government motor vehicles contrary to Item V (2) of COA Circular No. 75-6 dated November 7, 1975. 



Section 5 of Batas Pambansa Bilang 74, an act amending certain sections of Republic Act No. 4136, otherwise known as the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, provides, among others, the following:

	

a)		All motor vehicles and trailer of any type used or operated on or upon any highway of the Philippines must be registered with the Bureau of Land Transportation (now the Land Transportation Office LTO) for the current year in accordance with the Act.

	

b)		Any registration of motor vehicles not renewed on or before the date fixed by the Bureau of Land Transportation shall become delinquent and invalid.

Section 56 of R.A. No. 4136 states “Penalty for violation. The following penalties shall be imposed for violations of this Act:

a)	For registering later than seven (7) days after acquiring title to an unregistered motor vehicle or after conversion of a registered motor vehicle requiring larger registration fee than that for which it was originally registered or for renewal of a delinquent registration, the penalty shall be a fine of fifty percent (50%) of the registration fees corresponding to the portion of the year for which the vehicle is registered for use.”



Review of the inventory report of motor vehicles submitted by the OIC – Supply and Property Management Officer showed that the University has 19 serviceable motor vehicles. When the Audit Team requested for copies of Certificate of Registration (CR) and Official Receipts (OR), only 12 ORs and 14 CRs for verification, there was no OR/CR submitted for five motor vehicles. Details are shown in Annex D.



Review and verification of the submitted ORs/CRs showed that three motorcycle units are not yet registered with the LTO while the renewal of registration of 16 motor vehicles were delayed ranging from four to 208 months. Details of which are shown in the table below.

The failure to register and/or renew the motor vehicles within the prescribed period exposes the University to payments of penalties for non-registration/renewal and/or damages in case of accidents.



In addition, ocular inspection of serviceable motor vehicles disclosed that 18 out of 19 units of motor vehicles do not bear the logo of the University and not marked “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY” in violation of Item V(2) of COA Circular No. 75-6 dated November 7, 1975 which provides that All motor vehicles owned by the National Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, and all local government units including government-owned or controlled corporations, except those used by the officials enumerated under No. I hereof, should be plainly marked: FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (3 inches) under which should be written the corresponding name of the bureau, office, corporation, provincial, city, municipality, or other government unit operating or using the same. The mark should appear on each side of the motor vehicle. When there is no sufficient space on each side, the same should appear at the back and on the front just below the windshield of the motor vehicle.



Vehicles marked with “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY” would effectively serve as deterrent in using government vehicles for personal use. The markings along with the government plates sported by the motor vehicles would clearly identify ownership as government cars, and thus, could not be used for purposes other than official business.



The OIC – Supply and Property Management Officer informed that appropriate actions were already undertaken in the registration and/or renewal of all serviceable motor vehicles of the University. The said officer also assured compliance with the proper markings of the vehicles as provided under COA Circular No. 75-6 within the year.



We recommended and Management agreed that the University President direct the Property Officer to:

a)	facilitate the prompt registration with the LTO of all University vehicles in compliance with Republic Act No. 4136, as amended by Batas Pambansa Bilang 74 to avoid penalties for late registration and/or payment of damages/liabilities to third party/ies in case of accidents; and

b)	ensure that serviceable motor vehicles owned by the University are marked with “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY” with the name of the University in compliance with Item V(2) of COA Circular No. 75-6 dated November 7, 1975.







7)	Collections of ₱1,164,039.97 were not deposited intact as of year-end contrary to Section 69 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 and Section 32 of the Revised Cash Examination Manual thus, exposed government funds to risk of possible loss or misappropriation.



Section 69 of P.D. No. 1445 which is known as the “Government Auditing Code of the Philippines” requires that public officers authorized to receive and collect moneys arising from taxes, revenues or receipts of any kind shall remit or deposit intact the full amounts so received and collected by them to the treasury of the agency concerned.



Section 32 of the Revised Cash Examination Manual provides:

	

			All Collecting Officers (COs) shall deposit intact all their collections, as well as collections turned over to them by sub-collectors/tellers, with authorized government depository bank (AGDB) daily or not later than the next banking day. Where collections are minimal and daily deposit thereof becomes costly and impractical, the COs shall deposit their collections at least once a week, or as soon as the collections reach P10,000.00. They shall record all deposits made in the CRR. (Underscoring supplied)

		

The Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020 of the University disclosed the following balances of Cash – Collecting Officer account: 



Fund

Balance as of 12.31.2020

Fund 164

₱ 1,075,087.97

Fund 163

88,952.00

TOTAL

₱ 1,164,039.97



Verification of reports disclosed that the balance of Cash – Collecting Officer account represents undeposited collections as of year-end, contrary to Section 69 of P.D. No. 1445 and Section 32 of the Revised Cash Examination Manual which require that collections shall be deposited intact daily or not later than the next banking day with the authorized government depository bank. 



Management informed that the concerned Collecting Officers were already directed to remit their collections immediately.



The failure of the Collecting Officers to deposit their collections intact daily or in the next banking day resulted in the accumulation of undeposited collections totaling ₱1,164,039.97 thus, exposing government funds to possible loss or misappropriation.



We recommended and Management agreed that the University President instruct the University Cashier and Collecting Officers to deposit all collections intact to the authorized government depository bank daily but not later than the next banking day in compliance with Section 69 of P.D. No. 1445 and Section 32 of the Revised Cash Examination Manual and to closely monitor   all collections and deposits of COs in other campuses as well as reconciliation of records.





8)	Six (6) Collecting Officers (COs) were not bonded, contrary to Section 4.1 of Treasury Circular (TC) No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009, thus exposed the University from the risk of non-recovery of the funds in case of loss due to theft or defalcation.



	Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009 prescribes the “Revised Omnibus Regulations Governing the Fidelity Bonding of Accountable Officers Pursuant to the Public Bonding Law (Sections 313-335 Chapter 15, revised Administrative Code of 1917)”.

	

	Section 4.1 of the said circular provides that “Public Officers Covered – Every officer, agent and employee of the Government of the Philippines or of the companies or corporations of which the majority of the stock is held by the National Government (NG), regardless of the status of their appointment shall, whenever the nature of the duties performed by such officer, agent or employee permits or requires the possession, custody or control of funds or properties for which he is accountable, be deemed a bondable officer and shall be bonded or bondable and his fidelity insured (Section 314 & 318, PBL).

	

	Inquiry and examination of the submitted copies of Fidelity Bond of Accountable Officers of the University for CY 2020 disclosed that the following Collecting Officers with total collections ranging from ₱2,840.00 to ₱481,841.00 for the year were not bonded, contrary to Section 4.1 of TC No. 02-2009:

	

Name of Collecting Officer Who are not Bonded

Cash Collections/ Accountability in CY 2020

Danilo M. Miñon

₱      2,840.00

Rey P. Rasgo

Jerry Fuentes,

17,850.00

Mar A. Dela Cruz

481,841.00

Carmelinda M. Juanzo

121,645.00



Management admitted that they failed to secure fidelity bonds of the above-named accountable officers.

The non-compliance on the bonding of COs for CY 2020 pursuant to above Treasury Circular exposed the University to risk of non-recovery in case of loss of government funds.



We recommended and Management agreed that the University President cause the immediate processing of fidelity bonds of the six Collecting Officers in accordance with Section 4.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009.





9)	Unused balance of ₱1,028,403.08 sourced from funds transferred by different National Government Agencies (NGAs) for the implementation of various projects of the University were not returned to the Source Agency (SA), contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994, thus depriving the NGAs of the opportunity to use the fund for other priority projects/programs of the government.

	

	COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 sets forth the rules and regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to implementing agencies. This is to ensure that the transfer is properly taken up in the books of both the Source Agency (SA) and the Implementing Agency (IA), the transferred funds are used only for the intended purpose and that proper accounting and reporting is made of the utilization of the funds.

	

	Section 6.7 of the same COA Circular emphasized that the IA shall return to SA any unused balance and refund of disallowance upon completion of the project.

	

	Verification of the supporting schedule for the Due to NGAs account as of December 31, 2020 showed that it includes a total of ₱1,028,403.08 unexpended balance in the implementation of various projects out of funds transferred from other National Government Agencies that were not returned to Source Agency after completion of the projects/programs, as follows:

		Management explained that Project Coordinators were already instructed to facilitate validation of completed projects and to coordinate with the Source Agency/ies for the return of the unutilized funds.

		

		The failure of the University to return the unutilized amount of P1,028,403.08 to the concerned SAs is contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013 and deprived the NGAs-SAs the opportunity to immediately use the funds for other priority projects/programs of the government.

		

		We recommended and Management agreed that the University President instruct the University Accountant to:

	

a)		evaluate and validate the completed projects/programs and return to the Source Agency/ies the unutilized balance of ₱1,028,403.08 pursuant to Section 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994; and

	

b)		closely monitor the status of all transferred fund balances recorded under the Due to NGAs account and ensure that liquidations are regularly reported to SAs and appropriately recorded in the books of account of the University.

		



10)	Financial Statements, accounting reports and corresponding schedules, together with the Official Receipts/Disbursement Vouchers/Payrolls and supporting documents were submitted to the Audit Team  in 18 to 299 days  beyond the deadline set under Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies and COA Circular No 2015-007 dated October 22, 2015 thus, precluded the Audit Team to conduct timely audit of accounts and review of financial statements of the University.



	COA Circular No. 2015-007 dated October 22, 2015 prescribes the Government Accounting Manual for use of all National Government Agencies (NGAs) consisting of departments, bureaus, offices and instrumentalities, including state universities and colleges, in accordance with pertinent accounting and budgeting rules and regulations. 

	

	In the same COA Circular, Chief Accountants are required to ensure that the reports and supporting documents submitted by the accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten days of the ensuing month.

	

	Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of the said Manual also sets the deadlines on the submission of reports which provides that “All NGAs shall prepare and submit the following financial statements and schedules as shown below. in the 

	ng table.

	Monitoring of the submission of accounts and monthly Trial Balances and quarterly financial/accounting reports for the year revealed that these were not submitted within the prescribed period under COA Circular No. 2015-007.   Significant delays ranging from 18 to 299 days were noted, as summarized and illustrated in the table and in the line chart below. (Details are shown in Annex E)

	The line chart on the monthly submission of accounts (i.e., journals, vouchers, payroll, trial balances and supporting schedules) above shows that monthly reports for the months of January to August have the most number of days delayed for Funds 101 and 164. On the other hand, the line chart for the quarterly submission of financial statements shows the greatest number of days delayed for the 1st to 3rd quarters of the year.

	

	The University Accountant explained that delay in the submission of monthly and quarterly reports together with the supporting documents and schedules particularly in the 1st and 2nd quarters of CY 2020 was mainly due to restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, work suspensions and alternative working arrangements. Nevertheless, delays on the submission of accounts and reports were minimized on the 3rd quarter of the year in fact other reports were already submitted on time.

	

	Delayed submission of the Agency’s financial reports for CY 2020 prevented the Audit Team to conduct timely review and audit of financial transactions and accounts of the University. Thus, any defects and/or deficiencies that may be noted were not promptly communicated to Management for immediate action and/or option to resort to other remedial measures to improve operations and to avoid possible audit suspensions/ disallowances in audit.  

	

	We recommended and Management agreed  that the University President require the Accountant and the concerned officers/employees to give priority in the preparation and submission of the required financial reports including supporting schedules and other documents within the prescribed period in compliance with Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) to facilitate timely review of financial transactions and prompt correction of errors and defects by Management, if any.





11)	Special Trust Fund amounting to P983,060.00 intended for instruction, research, extension or other similar programs or projects of the University was used for payment of Representation Allowance (RA) and Transportation Allowance (TA) and salary differentials contrary to Section 4(d) of R.A. No. 8292 and Section 11.1.1 of DBM National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 548 dated May 15, 2013May 15, 2013, thus defeats the purpose for which the STF was created. Moreover, of the total payments of ₱917,000.00 for RATA, ₱393,750.00 was granted to unauthorized officials, hence disallowed in audit.

	 

	Section 4(d) of R.A. No. 8292, otherwise known as the “Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997” provides that any income generated by the University or College from tuition fees and other charges, as well as from the operation of auxiliary services and land grants, shall be retained by the university or college and may be disbursed by the BOR/BOT for instruction, research, extension or other program/projects of the university or college, provided, that all fiduciary fees shall be disbursed for the specific purposes for which they are collected.

	

	Section 11.1.1 of DBM NBC No. 548 dated May 15, 2013 provides that “The amounts required for the grant of commutable or reimbursable RATA to incumbents or OICs of regular positions and to designated officials in the SUCs shall be charged to the respective agency appropriations/budgets for the purpose. In case of deficiencies, the same shall be charged against agency savings.”

	

	Further, Section 2.1.4 of COA Circular No. 2000-002 dated April 4, 2000 which prescribes the Accounting Guidelines and Procedures on the Use of Income of SUCs pursuant to R.A. No. 8292, explicitly states that “In no case shall the STF be used for the payment of salaries and creation of new positions.” 

	

	Review and examination of the Statement of Financial Performance as of December 31, 2020 of the University showed that Representation Allowance and Transportation Allowance account have balances of ₱992,590.00 and ₱239,875.00, respectively.

Government officials shall be entitled only to allowances and other benefits expressly provided by law, and other statutory authority, and rules and regulations promulgated by competent authority. Unauthorized payment of the said allowances resulted to irregular expenses subject to audit disallowances.



 Management informed that they are not aware that the use of STF for the payment of RATA is not allowed. 



	Moreover, review of the Statement of Financial Performance of the University as of December 31, 2020 showed that Salaries and Wages – Regular account has a balance of ₱66,060.00. 

	

	Post-audit of vouchers disclosed that the said account was composed of the salary differentials of designated VPs paid for the month of March 2020 as presented in the table next page.

	Management explained that the payment of the salary differentials for the month of March 2020 were erroneously charged to STF.

	

The payments of RATA and salary differentials out of the STF is contrary to Section 4(d) of R.A. No. 8292 and Section 2.1.4 of COA Circular No. 2000-002 and defeat the purpose for which the fund was created.  Such disbursements were considered irregular and therefore disallowable in audit.

.

We recommended and Management agreed that the University President:

a)	 stop the payment of RATA and salary differentials out of the Special Trust Fund intended for instruction, research, extension or other similar programs or projects of the University; and

b)	make representation with the DBM for the inclusion/entitlement of RATA of University Officials designated as Vice-Presidents, Deans of Colleges, Directors of centers/institutes/services and satellite campuses consistent with NBC Nos. 404 and 538 in the ensuing year and onwards.



		

B)				GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT (GAD)

			

12)	Out of the total appropriations of ₱17,915,000.00 for Gender and Development for CY 2020, expenditures amounting to ₱16,939,363.92 or 94.55% were not utilized in accordance with the reviewed and endorsed GAD Plan and Budget for the year contrary to Sections 9 and 10.1 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular 2012-01 thus, depleting the fund for gender issues identified in the GPB and deprived the intended beneficiaries of the benefits in the implementation of identified GAD programs, activities and projects (PAPs). 



	Republic Act No. 9710, otherwise known as the “Magna Carta of Women (MCW)” was enacted to eliminate discrimination against women by recognizing, respecting, protecting, fulfilling and promoting the rights of Filipino women, especially those in the marginalized sectors. 

	Corollary thereto, the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) and the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) issued Joint Circular No. 2012-01 to provide guidelines for the annual Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Budgets and Accomplishment Reports to implement the MCW. Section 9.0 which pertains to the implementation and monitoring of the GAD Plan and Budget states that:  



9.1 Upon receipt of the letter of endorsement from PCW and or the adjusted GPB, the agency head shall issue an appropriate policy directive, copy furnished PCW, to disseminate and implement the GPBs. The directive shall mandate the agency GFPS to: a) provide technical assistance, as needed, to attached agencies, bureaus and regional offices in the implementation of the GPBs; b) monitor its implementation; c) ensure the preparation and submission of GAD ARs; and d) consolidate reports on the implementation of the GPBs. 



9.2 Agencies shall inform the PCW in writing if there are changes in the PCW-endorsed GPBs as a result of revising the GPB based on the approved GAA and or the need to implement additional PAPs relevant to current gender issues or GAD-related undertakings as needed. PCW, in turn, shall acknowledge receipt of adjusted GPB and shall inform the agencies if the GAD PAPs or activities in the adjusted GPB are acceptable. 



Moreover, Section 10.0 on the preparation and submission of GAD Accomplishment Reports provides that: 



						10.1 Attached agencies, bureaus, regional offices, constituent units and all others concerned shall submit their GAD ARs to their central offices. The agency GFPS shall prepare the annual GAD AR based on the PCW-endorsed GPB or the GPB adjusted to the approved GAA following the form prescribed in Annex B. Activities completed until the end of the year may be included in the final GAD AR of agency submitted to PCW in January (underscoring supplied). 



	During the year, the University had appropriated ₱17,915,000.00 or approximately 6.51% of its total Annual Budget of ₱275,327,000.00 per R.A. No. 11465 or the General Appropriations Act for FY 2020 for Gender and Development (GAD) programs, activities and projects as required under Rule VI, Section 37(A) of IRR of R.A. No. 9710 that, “At least five percent (5%) of the total agency or LGU budget appropriation shall correspond to activities supporting GAD Plans and Programs. Xxx” 

	

	Review of the GAD Accomplishment Report for CY 2020 showed that ₱10,919,813.36 or 60.95% was utilized by the University for various GAD projects, programs and activities leaving the total amount of ₱6,995,186.64 unexpended during the year. However, comparison between GAD Accomplishment Report and the GAD Plan and Budget for CY 2020 disclosed that expenditures thereto totaling ₱9,200,296.28 or 84.25% of the utilized budget was not included in the reviewed and endorsed GPB for CY 2020.

	*Not included in the Attributed program of the reviewed and endorsed GPB for CY 2020

	

	As can be gleaned from the table above, the University was only able to utilize a total of ₱975,636.08 from the reviewed and endorsed GPB for CY 2020, thereby falling short in the attainment of addressing gender-related issues and concerns for PAPs with appropriation of ₱16,939,363.90 for the year. It was also noted that expenditures under some PAPs under client-focused activities implemented exceeded the budgeted amount by ₱743,881.00 which demonstrated deficiencies in planning and budgeting. 

	

	Inquiry with the former GAD Director responsible in the preparation of GPB for CY 2020 disclosed that no adjusted or revised GAD Plan and Budget for the year was submitted to PCW for any changes/additional implementation of PAPs relevant to GAD undertakings contrary to Section 9.2 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular 2012-01. She also explained that the budget for the Rehabilitation of the Multi-Purpose Building of ₱9,200,269.28 was part of GPB of previous years.

	

	Also, it was explained that some PAPs were not implemented for the year due to the restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the identified attributed GAD program for CY 2020, namely: the Rehabilitation of College of Arts and Sciences has just started in December 2020, while the Construction of Students’ Dormitory Construction of Students’ Dormitory was already awarded in January 2021.

	

	The non-implementation of the GAD PAPs identified in the reviewed and endorsed GPB for CY 2020, deprived the intended beneficiaries of the benefits that may be derived therefrom. 



We recommended and Management agreed that the University President instruct the GAD Focal Person to ensure full implementation of the planned GAD programs and activities as stated in the reviewed and endorsed GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and ensure that supplemental GPB must be prepared and submitted for review to PCW for PAPs not included in the original GPB.





C)		COMPLIANCE WITH TAX LAWS

			

13)	Taxes withheld from employees and suppliers totaling ₱408,968.84 remained unremitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) as of year-end contrary to BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 23-2012 dated February 14, 2012, which could lead to the incurrence of unnecessary expenses to the University for penalties and/or interest as provided under Sections 249 and 251 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997. 



	BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 23-2012 dated February 14, 2012 provides that “all government agencies are reminded to withhold applicable taxes on certain income payments and responsible official and employees as withholding agent should see to it that taxes withheld are accordingly remitted on or before due dates and corresponding sanctions shall be imposed for non-compliance thereof.”

	

	Sections 249 and 251 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 provides the following guidelines for non-remittance of collections. 

	

	Section 249.  Interest 

 

a)	In General.  There shall be assessed and collected on any unpaid amount of tax, interest at the rate of 20% per annum, or such higher rates as may be prescribed by rules and regulations, from the date prescribed for payment until the amount is fully paid. 



b)	Deficiency Interest.  Any deficiency in the tax due, as the term is defined in this Code, shall be subject to the interest prescribed in Subsection (A) hereof, which interest shall be assessed and collected from the date prescribed for its payment until the full payment thereof. 

 

c. Xxx



Section 251.  Failure of a Withholding Agent to Collect and Remit Tax further provides that “Any person required to withhold, account for, and remit any tax imposed by this Code or who willfully fails to withhold such tax, or account for and remit such tax, or aids or abets in any manner to evade any such tax or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided for under this Chapter, be liable upon conviction to a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax not withheld, or not accounted for and remitted.”



Examination of the submitted Schedules of the Due to BIR account disclosed that taxes withheld from suppliers and employees were not remitted within the prescribed due dates.  Total taxes withheld in CYs 2016 to 2020 that remained unremitted amounted to ₱408,968.84, as shown below.

		The failure of the University to fully remit all taxes withheld to the Bureau of Internal Revenue resulted in the accumulation of past due balances totaling ₱408,968.84. Likewise, the non-remittance of all taxes withheld within the prescribed due dates may lead to the incurrence of unnecessary expenses for interest and/or penalties that may be imposed by the BIR.

		

		It was explained by the Accountant that representations before the Bureau of Internal Revenue were made for purposes of reconciling and settlement of withheld taxes from employees and suppliers.

		

		We recommended and Management agreed that the University President instruct the Accountant to properly monitor all taxes withheld from suppliers and employees and the remittance of the same to the BIR within the prescribed period; and charge to the personal account of the accountable officer responsible, all the interest and penalties for the late remittance for the remiss of his duties and responsibilities.



14)	The validity and accuracy of the Due to BIR account balance of ₱1,947,922.82 as of year-end is unreliable due to unreconciled abnormal/negative amounts and unaccounted balance of ₱49,799.27 and ₱190,794.39, respectively, inconsistent with Section 111 of Presidential Decree No. 1445.



	Section 111 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 states that:

	(1)  The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.

(2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.

	

The Statement of Financial Position of the University as of December 31, 2020 presented that the Due to BIR account has a balance of ₱1,947,922.82 as shown below.

The negative balances reduced the ending balance of the Due to BIR account by ₱49,799.27. While the presence of unaccounted balance of ₱190,794.39 cast doubt on the validity and accuracy of the Due to BIR account.



Financial information is reliable when the quality of information assures users that such is free from bias and error/misstatements and faithfully represents what it purports to represent.



During the exit conference the Accountant assured that investigations of the negative balances of the account shall be undertaken and necessary adjusting entries shall be made in the ensuing year. 



We recommended and Management agreed that the University President instruct the University Accountant to analyze the Due to BIR account and make the necessary adjustments, if warranted, with the view of eliminating negative balances totaling ₱49,799.27; and investigate and reconcile the causes of unaccounted balance of ₱190,794.39.





D)		COMPLIANCE WITH GSIS AND HDMF (Pag-IBIG) LAW

15)		GSIS and Pag-IBIG premiums and loan amortizations deducted from the salaries of its personnel were not remitted in intact/full within the prescribed period under R.A. No. 8291 and R.A. No. 9679, resulting in the accumulation of unremitted balance of ₱627,701.04 and ₱208,027.47 under the Due to GSIS and Due to Pag-IBIG accounts, respectively. 



Section 13 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 8291 or “The Government Service Insurance System Act of 1997 provides that government agencies are mandated to withhold the personal share of the members, deduct the same from their fixed monthly compensation and promptly remit the withheld premiums to GSIS. In addition, delayed remittances to GSIS of the premium contributions deducted from the compensation of the members and any use of it for other purposes are strictly prohibited.



Further, each government agency is required to remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and government agency’s contributions within the first Ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply in accordance with Section 14.1 of the same IRR. Moreover, Section 14.2 and 14.3 provides that government agencies shall deduct from monthly compensation of the employee the loan amortizations (consolidated loans, policy loan, emergency loan, housing loan, and other loans), premium payments (optional, pre-need and other non-life insurance) and other amounts due the GSIS and remit the same to GSIS within the first Ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month when the deductions were effected, accompanied by supporting lists in the form prescribed by the GSIS.



Likewise, Section 2 Rule VII of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 9679 otherwise known as “Home Development Mutual Fund Law of 2009” provides that monthly contributions of members to the Fund shall be collected through payroll deductions by their respective employers. Likewise, if a member avails of any loan from the Fund and the member consents in writing to amortize or pay the same through salary deductions, the employer shall be duty-bound to faithfully implement the same and shall continue to do so until the loan is fully paid.



Also, all employers shall remit to the Fund their contributions and the contributions of their covered employees as well as the latter’s loan amortizations or payments to the Fund, within fifteen (15) days from the date the same were collected unless another period is previously agreed upon between the employer and the Fund, or within such periods as the Fund may prescribe otherwise in accordance with Section 3.a Rule VII of the same IRR.



As of December 31, 2020, the amounts withheld and remitted by the University are shown in the table next page.

	Review of remittances made to GSIS and Pag-IBIG disclosed that premiums/ contributions and loan amortizations withheld from employees’ salaries were not fully remitted; though the amount is minimal it can in anyway contribute in the accumulation of unpaid obligations to the concerned institution or agency. 

	

	It was explained by the University Accountant during the exit conference that they are in the process of reconciliation with the Human Resource Department in-charge on the monitoring and preparation of payroll on the said discrepancies and assured that necessary correcting or adjusting entries will be made.

	

	The noted deficiencies resulted in the accumulation of balances of the Due to GSIS and Pag-IBIG accounts of ₱627,701.04 and ₱208,027.47, respectively, as of year-end. Likewise, non-remittance/delayed remittance of mandatory contributions and loan amortizations to the respective Agencies may result in the imposition of penalties and interest which could result to suspension of loan privileges of employees of the University and/or deprived the benefits due them.

	

	We reiterated our recommendation and Management agreed that the University President instruct the University Accountant to reconcile and investigate the causes of the unaccounted balances, and accordingly, remit the unremitted balance, if any, and prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the amounts reported.









	E. 	COMPLIANCE WITH PHILHEALTH REGULATIONS

		

		Section 18 of R.A. No. 10606, otherwise known as the National Health Insurance Act of 2014 provides that “It shall be mandatory for all government agencies to include the payment of premium contribution in the respective annual appropriations: xxx”. 

		

		For CY 20120, the University withhold and remitted its collections to PhilHealth throughout the years, however, the Audit Team was unable to validate the reported negative balance of ₱214.27 for erroneous posting due to non-maintenance of updated records in the Accounting Department.  The negative balance also indicates over-remittance of collected contributions to PhilHealth.

		

		

A)	COMPLIANCE WITH SENIOR CITIZEN AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITY (PWD) LAW



		The submitted accomplishment report for CY 2020 did not show any programs and accomplishments for senior citizens and persons with disability apparently because the University did not allocate funds for the Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability. However, there are existing facilities/structures such as ramps and railings in the hall way of the building that enhanced the mobility of the senior citizens and differently-abled persons.  

		

			

B)	PRIORITY DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE FUND (PDAF) AND DISBURSEMENT ACCELERATION PROGRAM (DAP)

			

		 The University has not received any funds for PDAF and DAP nor has any balances of the same as of December 31, 2020.

		

		 

C)		ODA FUNDED PROJECTS

		The University is not a recipient of any Official Development Assistance (ODA) funds during the year.

			

			

D)				 STATUS OF SUSPENSIONS, DISALLOWANCES AND CHARGES



		The University has no unsettled Notices of Suspensions and Charges, however, it has unsettled Notices of Disallowance as of December 31, 2020 totaling ₱5,598,602.17 (Annex F).
