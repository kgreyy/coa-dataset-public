Financial Performance 

 

 
 

Scope of Audit 

  

The Audit Team conducted Financial and Compliance Audit on the accounts and 

operations of the University for CY 2020.  It included analysis of accounts in the 

financial statements, review of transactions and test of compliance with financial rules 

and regulations and assessment on the program’s effectiveness, efficiency and economy.  

The objectives of the audit are to, (a) express an opinion on whether your financial 

statements are fairly presented, in all material respects, in accordance with International 

Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS)/International Financial Reporting Standards 

(IFRS); (b) communicate whether the internal control, particularly those affecting 

accounting and financial reporting systems, are operating effectively to provide 

reasonable assurance that misstatements, losses, or non-compliance would be reported in 

a timely basis; and (c) communicate the results of tests of compliance with selected 

provisions of laws and regulations, including budgetary and accountability issues, and 

details of audit suspensions, charges and disallowances identified during the audit.  

Audit Opinion on the Financial Statements 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the 

financial statements of RSU as the accuracy and existence of the recorded balances of 

Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts with a total net book value of 

₱396,487,241.37 (excluding Construction-in-Progress account) is doubtful due to a) non-

provision of depreciation expense on PPEs with total book value of ₱150,278,200.53; b)

non-maintenance of PPE Ledger Cards (PPELC) and Property Cards (PC) for each 

category of PPE; and c) discrepancy between the accounting records and the Report on 

the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) totaling ₱1,952,623.77, 

contrary to Sections 27 and 42, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual 

(GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I.  
 

Significant Observations and Recommendations 

 

For the exception cited above, we recommended and Management agreed that the 

University President instruct the (a) Accountant to exhaust possible means to determine 

the costs and dates of acquisition of the PPE and provide for their depreciation using the 

straight-line method of depreciation and record in the books in compliance with Section 

27, Chapter 10, of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, in order to present fairly the values of the 

PPE and equity accounts in the financial statements; and (b) Accountant and the OIC-

Supply and Property Officer to (i) maintain a complete and updated PPELCs and PCs, 

respectively, pursuant to Section 42, Chapter 10 of the same Manual, to record the 

necessary information of the specific PPE accounts; and (ii) reconcile both the 

Accounting and Property records and make necessary adjustments for any 

discrepancy/ies noted to reflect the accurate values of PPE accounts in the financial 

statements.  

  

In addition, hereunder are the other significant observations and the corresponding 

recommended courses of action: 

 

1. The accuracy of the reported year-end balance of Cash - Modified Disbursement 
System (MDS), Regular of ₱0.00 was unreliable due to the failure of the Accountant 

to prepare and submit monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS).  As a result, 

the discrepancy of ₱3,084,375.77 between the book and bank balances as at year-end 

was not reconciled.  Likewise, the balance of Cash in Bank – Local Currency, 

Current Account (LCCA) of ₱183,418,849.35 is doubtful as reconciling items and/or 

errors of ₱801,944.73 remained unadjusted in the books, contrary to pertinent 

Sections of Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 

Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, thus, affecting the fair presentation of the 

Cash accounts in the financial statements. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to (a) avail of the service facilities – 

weAccess and eMDS – of Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) to enable to obtain 

the necessary electronic data in preparing the monthly bank reconciliation statements 

so that errors/omissions, if any, are immediately detected for correction and 

adjustment in the books of accounts to ensure that Cash in Bank account balances are 

correctly presented in the financial statements; and (b) ensure compliance with 

pertinent sections of Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs, 

Volume I, in the preparation and reporting of Bank Reconciliation Statements. 

 

   



iv 
 

2. Unliquidated cash advances (CA) accumulated to ₱4,675,282.74 as of December 31, 
2020 due to non-observance of existing rules and regulations on the grant, utilization 

and liquidation of CA prescribed under COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 

1997 thus, overstated the receivables and understated the expenses/surplus accounts 

equivalent to the amounts already expended, if any.  Moreso, it also exposed the 

government funds to risk of possible loss and misappropriation. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to (a) direct the concerned accountable 

officers and employees to settle/liquidate immediately all outstanding cash advances 

at year-end.  In case of failure, cause the withholding of any money due them and 

institute appropriate administrative proceedings and enforce sanctions against them, 

if warranted; and (b) undertake measures to strictly adhere to pertinent provisions of 

COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 on the grant and liquidation of 

cash advances. 

 

3. Twenty-nine (29) parcels of land, acquired through purchase or donation by the 
University with a total cost/market value of ₱34,975,656.45 were not yet covered 

with Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) in the name of the University contrary to 

Sections 39 and 63 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, otherwise known as the 

Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, thus the interest of the government 

was not fully protected.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed that the University President (a) direct 

the Property Officer to facilitate the registration and transfer of title of the lands in 

the name of the University, whether acquired through purchase or donation to protect 

the interest of the University in compliance with Sections 39 and 63 of Presidential 

Decree No. 1445; (b) create an appraisal committee to come up with the appraised 

value of the lands, in case of acquisitions by donation, as the basis for the recording 

thereof; and (c) instruct the University Accountant and the Property Officer to 

maintain subsidiary ledger and property cards, respectively, for each land/property 

with all the necessary information relative thereto. 

 

4. Collections of ₱1,164,039.97 were not deposited intact as of year-end contrary to 
Section 69 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 and Section 32 of the Revised 

Cash Examination Manual thus, exposed government funds to risk of possible loss or 

misappropriation. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed that the University President instruct the 

University Cashier and Collecting Officers to deposit all collections intact to the 

authorized government depository bank daily but not later than the next banking day 

in compliance with Section 69 of P.D. No. 1445 and Section 32 of the Revised Cash 

Examination Manual and to closely monitor   all collections and deposits of COs in 

other campuses as well as reconciliation of records. 

 

 



v 
 

5. Financial Statements, accounting reports and corresponding schedules, together with 
the Official Receipts/Disbursement Vouchers/Payrolls and supporting documents 

were submitted to the Audit Team  in 18 to 299 days  beyond the deadline set under 

Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 

National Government Agencies and COA Circular No 2015-007 dated October 22, 

2015 thus, precluded the Audit Team to conduct timely audit of accounts and review 

of financial statements of the University. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed  that the University President require the 

Accountant and the concerned officers/employees to give priority in the preparation 

and submission of the required financial reports including supporting schedules and 

other documents within the prescribed period in compliance with Section 60, Chapter 

19, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) to facilitate timely 

review of financial transactions and prompt correction of errors and defects by 

Management, if any. 

 

6. Special Trust Fund amounting to P983,060.00 intended for instruction, research, 
extension or other similar programs or projects of the University was used for 

payment of Representation Allowance (RA) and Transportation Allowance (TA) and 

salary differentials contrary to Section 4(d) of R.A. No. 8292 and Section 11.1.1 of 

DBM National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 548 dated May 15, 2013May 15, 2013, 

thus defeats the purpose for which the STF was created. Moreover, of the total 

payments of ₱917,000.00 for RATA, ₱393,750.00 was granted to unauthorized 

officials, hence disallowed in audit. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed that the University President (a) stop the 

payment of RATA and salary differentials out of the Special Trust Fund intended for 

instruction, research, extension or other similar programs or projects of the 

University; and (b) make representation with the DBM for the inclusion/entitlement 

of RATA of University Officials designated as Vice-Presidents, Deans of Colleges, 

Directors of centers/institutes/services and satellite campuses consistent with NBC 

Nos. 404 and 538 in the ensuing year and onwards. 

 

7. Out of the total appropriations of ₱17,915,000.00 for Gender and Development for 
CY 2020, expenditures amounting to ₱16,939,363.92 or 94.55% were not utilized in 

accordance with the reviewed and endorsed GAD Plan and Budget for the year 

contrary to Sections 9 and 10.1 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular 2012-01 thus, 

depleting the fund for gender issues identified in the GPB and deprived the intended 

beneficiaries of the benefits in the implementation of identified GAD programs, 

activities and projects (PAPs). 

 

We recommended and Management agreed that the University President instruct the 

GAD Focal Person to ensure full implementation of the planned GAD programs and 

activities as stated in the reviewed and endorsed GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and 

ensure that supplemental GPB must be prepared and submitted for review to PCW 

for PAPs not included in the original GPB. 



vi 
 

8. Taxes withheld from employees and suppliers totaling ₱408,968.84 remained 
unremitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) as of year-end contrary to BIR 

Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 23-2012 dated February 14, 2012, 

which could lead to the incurrence of unnecessary expenses to the University for 

penalties and/or interest as provided under Sections 249 and 251 of the National 

Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed that the University President instruct the 

Accountant to properly monitor all taxes withheld from suppliers and employees and 

the remittance of the same to the BIR within the prescribed period; and charge to the 

personal account of the accountable officer responsible, all the interest and penalties 

for the late remittance for the remiss of his duties and responsibilities. 

 

The above audit findings and recommendations were discussed with concerned 

officials and employees in an exit conference conducted on March 24, 2021.  

Management’s views and comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

 

Summary of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges

has unsettled Notices of Disallowance as of December 31, 2020 totaling ₱5,598,602.17. 

Of the unsettled audit disallowances, ₱5,351,102.17 pertains to disallowances issued 

prior to the effectivity of the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA).
