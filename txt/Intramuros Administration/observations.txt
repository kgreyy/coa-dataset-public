 OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
    

 

A.  FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

Accounting Errors and Improper Accounting Treatment of Transactions 

 

There were no material misstatements noted in the financial statements of the IA. 

Accounting errors and improper accounting treatment of transactions that are 

considered departure from the International Public Sector Accounting Standards 

(IPSASs) were immediately adjusted in the Intramuros Administration (IA) books of 

accounts as at year-end. 

 

 

Accounting deficiencies and control gaps affecting the reliability of the Inventories and 

Property, Plant and Equipment accounts 

 

The following accounting deficiencies and control gaps affect the reliability of the 

Inventories and Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account balances due to the 

failure of the concerned agency officials to implement the required controls under 

existing issuances to facilitate the reconciliation and validation of said accounts were 

noted: 

 

1. The accuracy and reliability of the reported year-end balances of Inventories and 
PPE accounts with reported balances of P6,119,301.17 and P254,116,074.64, 

respectively, could not be fully ascertained due to the non-submission of reconciled 

inventory reports as well as the non-maintenance of an updated and reconciled 

records for inventory and property items of the Accounting Unit and the General 

Service Section (GSS). Other control gaps on accountability over the assets were 

also noted.  
 

1.1 Section 6, paragraph (e) Chapter 19, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual 
for National Government Agencies (GAM for NGAs) on Qualitative Characteristics of 

Financial Reporting states that an entity shall present information including accounting 

policies in a manner that meets reliable information which is free from material error 

and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports 

to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. 

 

1.2 The following deficiencies and gaps in the controls were noted in the audit of the IA’s 
year-end balances of Inventories and PPE:

 Stock Cards (SCs) of the GSS and Subsidiary 
Ledger Cards (SLCs) of the Accounting Unit 

were neither prepared nor updated.

Plant and Equipment submitted. 

 Property Cards of GSS were not updated and 
incomplete. 

 Property Acknowledgement Receipt are not 
renewed every three (3) years or when there 

is a change in custodianship/user of property. 

 Accounting Unit failed to prepare and 
maintain the Registry of Heritage Assets. 

 

a. Unsubstantiated Inventories accounts due to absence of inventory report and 
incomplete records 

 

1.3 Appendix 66, Volume II of the GAM for NGAs provides that Report on the Physical 
Count of Inventories (RPCI) shall be used to report the physical count of supplies by 

type of inventory as at a given date.  It shows the balance of inventory items per card 

and per count and shortage/overage, if any. These include the semi-expendable property 

wherein the issue is covered by Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS). It shall be prepared by 

fund cluster semi-annually by the Inventory Committee. The report shall be reconciled 

with the SLCs and SCs maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit, and Property 

and/or Supply Division/Unit, respectively. Any discrepancy shall be verified and/or 

adjusted accordingly. The report shall be submitted to the COA Auditor concerned not 

later than July 31 and January 31 of each year for the first and second semesters, 

respectively. 

 

1.4 Section 9, Chapter 8, Volume 1 of the GAM for NGAs requires that supplies and 
materials purchased for inventory purposes shall be recorded using the perpetual 

inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running total for 

the cost of goods sold in each period. The system requires accounting records to show 

the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the maintenance of the SLC by the 

Accounting Division/Unit and SC by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each 

item in stock. 

 

1.5 The semi-annual RPCIs for IA’s inventories were not submitted to the Office of the 
Auditor by the General Service Section due to the late conduct of physical count of 

inventories and non-completion of reconciliation/validation of inventory items with the 

Accounting records; thus, the existence and accuracy of the affected Inventory account 

balances in the books remain doubtful. 

 

1.6 Further verification of the documents from the GSS and Accounting Unit revealed that 
the respective SLCs and SCs maintained by them were neither prepared nor updated.  

 



40 

 

1.7 The personnel in the GSS claimed that some SCs for inventory items were not prepared 
as the items were already distributed to end-users upon delivery. Hence, discrepancies 

were noted such as SLCs maintained in the Accounting Unit were with no 

corresponding SCs in the GSS. Likewise, SCs and the SLCs were not updated real-time 

because transactions were not promptly posted from the source documents.  

 

1.8 Failure to immediately update the SCs and SLCs may cause the failure of the GSS   and 
Accounting personnel to recall and record the receipts and/or issuances of inventories 

that results in unreconciled differences. Consequently, the SCs and the SLCs will not 

reflect the accurate balance of inventories at any given time; hence, defeats the main 

purpose of maintaining the SCs and SLCs.  

 

1.9 It was also observed that there are only two (2) persons manning the GSS and 
performing all the duties and responsibilities of the GSS such as, (a) acceptance and 

inspection of inventories; (b) issuance of inventories as per Requisition Issuance Slip 

(RIS); (c) preparation of Inventory Custodian Slip; (d) preparation of the RPCI; and (e) 

preparation and maintenance of the SCs. One of them is also the custodian/keeper of 

the IA storage room where inventories are being kept. 

 

1.10 Due to lack of manpower in the GSS, the above-enumerated duties were not 
accomplished correctly. 

 

1.11 According to Management, the accounting staffs who are responsible in the preparation 
and maintenance of SLCs are newly-hired since the accounting personnel who was 

previously assigned to record the receipt and issuances of supplies and materials had 

already resigned. The newly hired accounting staffs are now in the process of updating 

and reconciling the SLCs. For SLCs under the Revolving Fund, it is worthy to mention 

that the Accounting staff has already started reconciling and updating each SL. 

 

1.12 We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 
 

a) Head of the GSS and the Chief of Business Management Division to schedule 
the conduct of physical count of inventories earlier to give time for 

reconciliation with the Accounting records and submit the Report of Physical 

Count of Inventory to the Office of the Auditor not later than July 31 and 

January 31 of each year for the first and second semesters, respectively; and 

 

b) GSS and the Accounting Unit to update and promptly post all transactions 
from source documents to the respective SCs and SLCs; and henceforth, 

reconcile their records regularly so that any discrepancies can be corrected 

and validated immediately.  

 

1.13 We also recommended and Management agreed to consider assigning additional 
personnel/staff in the GSS who will assist in the discharge of the duties and 

responsibilities of the Head of the GSS. 

 



41 

 

b. Unreliable balance of PPE accounts due to non-submission of inventory report and 
incomplete/updated records 

 

1.14 Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides the following accounting 
standards, among others, on PPE:  

 

a. The entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually 
and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and 

Equipment (RPCPPE) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to 

the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. (Section 38) 

 

b. The Chief Accountant shall maintain the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger 
Cards (PPELC) for each category of PPE. The Accounting Staff in charge in 

maintaining the PPELC shall record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, 

estimated life, depreciation, impairment, issue/transfers/disposal, repair history and 

other information about the property. For check and balance, the Property/Supply 

Office shall likewise maintain Property Cards (PCs) for PPE in their custody to 

account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be 

reconciled with the PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They 

shall also be reconciled with other property records like the Property 

Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR). (Section 42) 

 

c. The PAR shall be used by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to record the 
issuance of PPE to end-users, which shall be maintained by fund cluster and shall 

be renewed every three (3) years or every time there is a change in 

custodianship/user of the property. (Section 42; Appendix 71) 

 

d. For accountability purposes, a Registry of Heritage Assets (RHA) shall be 
maintained for heritage assets not recognized in the books of accounts, by the 

Accounting Division/Unit and appropriate PAR shall be issued to end- 

user/accountable officer. At the end of each month, the total amount shall be posted 

in the Registry of Heritage Asset-Summary (RHAS). (Section 30) 

 

1.15 Verification of the Audit Team disclosed that the physical count of the PPEs under the 
General and Revolving Funds was not conducted by the IA Management to validate the 

accuracy and existence of all IA’s properties as of December 31, 2020; hence, no 

RPCPPE duly reconciled with the GSS and Accounting records was submitted to the 

Audit Team. 

 

1.16 Management, on the other hand, commented that an Office Order No. 2020-07 dated 
January 14, 2020 was issued reconstituting a Team that will prepare the updated 

RPCPPE. However, conduct of PPEs’ physical count was not completed principally due 

to the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and declaration of lockdowns. 

 

1.17 In view of the failure of IA to complete/conduct the Physical Count of PPE that resulted 
in the non-submission of the RPCPPE and non-reconciliation of the PPEs with GSS 



42 

 

property records and corresponding account balances in the Accounting records, the 

accuracy and existence of the PPE account balance of P254,116,074.64 could not be 

fully ascertained. 

 

1.18 Moreover, the following gaps on accounting and property controls were noted in the 
review of IA’s property management: 

 

a. Property Cards were not updated and incomplete; hence, reconciliation of PPEs per 
Accounting and GSS records could not be easily done as required. The GSS was 

only able to update and complete the PCs for current year procured PPEs. For 

properties acquired in the prior years, PCs maintained by the GSS are still recorded 

in the old format with some end-users who are no longer connected with the IA.  

 

b. The PARs are not renewed every three (3) years or when there is a change in 
custodianship/user of property. The GSS is still in the process of updating each PAR 

which documents the issuance of PPE and the transfer of accountability to the end-

user.  

 

c. The Accounting Unit does not maintain the RHA and the RHAS for its heritage 
assets not recognized in the books of accounts for proper monitoring and 

accountability. Verification of the Schedule of Works of Arts, Archeological and 

Specimen submitted and maintained by the Accounting Unit revealed that although 

IA indeed maintained a List of its Works of Arts, Archeological and Specimen, 

some recorded Works of Arts, however, have no corresponding/recorded cost. 

Hence, the corresponding cost of said Works of Arts were not recognized in the 

books of accounts and consequently, not reflected/included in the total amount of 

the Works of Arts account. The Accountant however claimed that the costs of the 

said Works of Arts were not provided because there were no records/documents to 

support the same.  

 

1.19 It is emphasized, however, that those heritage assets that are not recognized in the books 
of accounts should be recorded in a separate registry called RHA and RHAS for 

accountability purposes. Further, the registry shall be certified correct by the Chief 

Accountant or the Head of Accounting Division/Unit at the end of year. 

 

1.20 We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 
 

a) IA Inventory Committee to conduct an annual physical count of PPE and 
submit a copy of the RPCPPE to the Office of the Auditor not later than 

January 31 of the following year in accordance with Section 38, Chapter 10, 

Volume I of the GAM for NGAs; 

 

b) GSS to complete and update PCs and renew PAR every three (3) years for all 
PPE items; 

 



43 

 

c) GSS and Accounting Unit to reconcile property and accounting records 
periodically to correct at once any discrepancies noted; and  

 

d) Accounting Unit to prepare and maintain Registry of Heritage Assets and 
Registry of Heritage Asset-Summary for purposes of monitoring 

accountability on heritage assets. 
 

 

B.  COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 

Utilization of the authorized budget and cash allocations 

 

2. Of the total authorized budget/allotment of P70,646,719.00 received by the IA in 

CY 2020, P69,822,720.45 or 98.83 percent was obligated; however, only 

P52,412,212.12 or 75.06 percent of the obligated allotments was actually disbursed 

due to the delayed implementation of one (1) project and planned activities. Of the 

total cash allocations of P67,411,966.00, P17,577,863.36 or 26 percent was not 

utilized which was consequently reverted to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr). 
 

a. Low disbursement rate 
 

2.1 Section 60 of Republic Act (RA) No. 11465, or the General Appropriations Act (GAA) 
of FY 2020, and Section 3.4 of the National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated 

January 6, 2020 under the Cash Budgeting System provides that all appropriations 

authorized under the FY 2020 GAA, including budgetary support to Government-

Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) and Special Account in the General Fund 

(SAGF), shall be available for release and disbursement for the purpose specified, and 

under the same General and Special Provisions of said GAA applicable thereto until 

December 31, 2020.  

 

2.2 RA No. 11520, as approved by the President on December 29, 2020, extended the 
availability of the FY 2020 appropriations to December 31, 2021, amending for the 

purpose Section 60 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 or the GAA of FY 2020. 

 

2.3 Further, Section 4.1 of NBC No. 580 dated April 22, 2020 provides that to partially 
generate the required amounts to implement the national policy which is to address the 

COVID-19 situation, while observing the overall expenditure program for FY 2020, 

government instrumentalities concerned are advised that 35 percent of programmed 

appropriations under the FY 2020 GAA shall no longer be made available for release 

effective on April 1, 2020.  Likewise, at least 10 percent of the total released allotments 

under Section 2 thereof for Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) and 

Capital Outlays (CO), shall no longer be available for obligation.  

 

2.4 In addition, NBC No. 580 provides that no allotment shall be released for new programs, 
projects, activities including Congress-Introduced Increases which are not likely to be 

implemented within the current calendar year. 



44 

 

 

2.5 Review of IA’s appropriations, allotments and obligations as of December 31, 2020 
showed that out of the total funds available for spending in the aggregate amount of 

P70,646,719.00, a total of P69,822,720.45 or 98.83 percent was obligated, leaving an 

unobligated/unutilized balance of P823,998.55 or 1.17 percent.  However, the rate of 

disbursement over obligations incurred of 75.06 percent or equivalent to 

P52,412,212.12 indicated a lower rate for the current year budget as compared to last 

year’s 97.99 percent.

utilization is presented below:

Overall Financial Utilization Rate 98.83% 1.17%   

Percentage of Disbursement over Obligations Incurred  75.06% 24.94% 

 

2.7 As can be gleaned from the above table, the bulk of undisbursed obligations aggregating 
P17,410,508.33 came from the MOOE  due to the delayed implementation of the project 

on Management Information System for Consulting Services for the Design and 

Development of IA’s Integrated Information System. The project with a contract cost 

of P14,056,866.96 was only awarded and obligated in December 2020. Further, repairs 

and maintenance of buildings and structures were not undertaken, and other supplies 

and materials were not procured brought about by the lockdown due to the COVID-19 

pandemic. 

  

b. Lapsed Cash Allocations 

 

2.8 The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Circular Letter No. 2013-12 dated 
November 21, 2013 was issued to further enhance the ability of agencies to fully utilize 

their Notice of Cash Allocations (NCAs). It provides that the comprehensive NCAs to 



45 

 

be released shall be based on the agency’s submitted Monthly Disbursement Program 

(MDP). It also prescribes that all NCAs for crediting to the Regular MDS sub-accounts 

shall be valid until the last working day of the 3rd month of the particular quarter. 

 

2.9 The DBM also issued NBC No. 578 to provide the Guidelines on the Release of Funds 
for FY 2020.  Section 4.2.2.2 of the said Circular provides that under the Common Fund 

System, to optimize the use of the available NCAs under the Regular MDS Sub-

Account, NCAs released to agencies can be used to cover payment of both current year 

and prior years’ accounts payables to all creditors (external and internal).  It is 

understood that payment of mandatories, i.e., PS, MOOE and CO requirements shall 

take precedence over Accounts Payables in the utilization of the NCAs received.  Only 

when the current mandatory requirements are satisfied can the payment of Accounts 

Payables be charged against the available NCAs. 

 

2.10 Review of the actual utilization of the available budget disclosed that NCAs aggregating 
P67,411,966.00 was received for the implementation of projects/programs/activities, 

payment of salaries and wages, personnel benefits and operating expenses of the agency 

for CY 2020. The amount of P49,834,102.64 or 73.92 percent was disbursed while 

P17,577,863.36 or 26.08 percent had lapsed and reverted to the BTr. Details are as

2.11 Out of the total received cash allocations of P67,411,966.00 presented above, cash 
allocations of P17,577,863.36 was reverted to the BTr due to delayed filing of 

billings/claims by the agency’s suppliers and service providers, hence were not paid; 

repairs and maintenance of buildings and structures that were not undertaken; and   

supplies and materials which were not procured due to the nationwide 

lockdown/quarantine brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic; and delayed 

implementation of the project Design and Development of the IA Integrated 

Information System costing P14,056,866.96. 

 

2.12 Management commented that proper measures are now being observed to address this 
concern and that they committed to fully utilize their current allotment and cash 

allocations despite the continuous intermittent operation of their office due to the 

ongoing pandemic. 

 

2.13 We recommended to Management to fast track the procurement of supplies and 
implementation of projects to hasten and ensure efficient management of its 

budget and available cash. 
 

 

Attainment of Targets vs. Accomplishments 

 

3. Only six (6) of IA’s 17 planned activities under the four (4) Organizational 
Outcomes (OOs) were met and/or exceeded the targets, while 11 activities 

registered low accomplishments due to the COVID–19 pandemic which caused 

lockdowns/community quarantines limiting operations, mobility, actions and 

events beyond the control of the Agency. However, the Agency was able to sustain 

the promotion program of Intramuros as it switched to online activities and was 

able to create the Intramuros Learning Session webinars aired in 41 episodes, 

three (3) virtual tours in Fort Santiago, San Diego and Casa Manila, the Kulay ng 

Kasaysayan and other online events.  

 

3.1 The DBM issued NBC No. 552 dated February 19, 2014 that defines OO as an outcome 
or result produced by the Agency that contributes to the achievement of the legislated 

mandate of that department or agency and is achieved through the production of goods 

or services to external clients Major Final Outputs (MFOs), delivered through its 

projects, activities and programs. 

 



47 

 

3.2 The Circular further discussed that Performance Indicator must include the target that 
the Agency is trying to achieve, the timeframe to obtain that target and the methods for 

collecting and measuring the performance data that is to be monitored. Performance 

Target is also defined as a quantitative goal with a time line (usually explicit, but 

sometimes implicit) for the achievement of that goal. The DBM requires the 

government agencies to submit reports to monitor their accomplishments/outputs vis-à-

vis the allotment/budget released to them.  

 

3.3 Pursuant to Proclamation No. 929 (s. 2020), the President of the Philippines declared a 
State of Calamity in the entire country for a period of six (6) months and imposed an 

ECQ over the entire Luzon effective  March 17,2020 until April 13, 2020. Thereafter, 

several proclamations were made by the President declaring the Metro Manila Area 

under the GCQ due to COVID-19 pandemic 

 

3.4 The accomplishments of the IA as reported in the Quarterly Physical Report of 
Operation as of December 31, 2020 vis-à-vis the target of the enumerated OOs disclosed

3.5 Review of the Agency’s accomplishments vis-à-vis its targets showed that Management 
was able to accomplish 100 percent  or exceeded its targets in six (6) out of  the 17 

activities under the four (4) OOs while the percentage of accomplishments in 11 

activities were registered below targets due to the COVID–19 pandemic which was 

beyond the control of the Agency.  



51 

 

 

3.6 Based on the above accomplishments, it was also noted that the Agency was only able 
to accomplish 37.94 percent of the 49.28 percent targeted conservation and 

development projects of existing artifacts maintained by IA. Moreover, only 2,277 out 

of 2,959 targeted number of artifacts were maintained. The existing artifacts are 

valuable items of our heritage and it is therefore incumbent upon the agency to protect, 

conserve and maintain them. With IA’s adoption of alternative work schedules, the 

Agency needs to strategize the assignment of responsible personnel to ensure proper 

maintenance of these artifacts.  

 

3.7 Conversely, despite the difficulty of holding physical and face-to-face  activities  during 
the quarantine period, the Agency was able to switch  to online activities and created 

the Intramuros Learning Session webinars aired in 41 episodes, three (3) virtual tours 

in Fort Santiago, San Diego and Casa Manila, the Kulay ng Kasaysayan and other online 

events which were held from May to December 2020 in order to sustain the promotion 

program of Intramuros. Hence, it was able to accomplish 72 events in this aspect, which 

surpassed the target of 49 events.  

 

3.8 We recommended and Management agreed to continuously monitor the 
accomplishment of IA’s performance targets taking into consideration the 

provision of appropriate strategies amidst challenges posed by the COVID-19 

pandemic to attain fully its target accomplishments in the ensuing year.  

 

 

Doubtful collection of long-outstanding receivables 

 

4. IA’s Accounts Receivables from its former tenants/lessees/ concessionaires totaling 

to P14,948,102.15 were doubtful of collection due to: (a) slow progress of filed cases 

against former tenants/lessees/concessionaires’ with unsettled accounts in the total 

amount of P12,116,036.51; and (b) inability of IA to locate and to file appropriate 

legal actions for the defaulting tenants/lessees/concessionaires with unsettled 

accounts of P2,832,065.64.

4.5 On March 13, 2018, the IA Administrator issued a Memorandum as an initiative move 
to settle concerns regarding Accounts Receivable; however, analysis showed that the 

above tenants’ unpaid rentals had no indicated progress of collection until December 

2020.  

 

4.6 Management commented that they acknowledge the fact that the resolution of the 
pending cases involving their former tenants poses some degree of uncertainty and delay 

due to some limitations beyond the control of IA. Some of the cases were already 



55 

 

decided upon by the lower courts in favor of the IA. Pending court cases are moving 

quite slowly; however, there are rules of law that need to be observed and followed 

insofar as civil cases are concerned.  

 

4.7 Management further commented that the evaluation of critical aspects of the cases are 
within the jurisdiction of the courts and unless ruled out with finality, accounts of these 

tenants will remain as receivables in the books of IA. 

 

b. Inability to locate and to file appropriate legal actions for the erring 
concessionaires with unsettled balance of P2,832,065.64   

 

4.8 IA has 16 accounts totaling P2,832,065.64 which remained unenforced/unsettled for 
over 5 years despite of the demand letters sent to the inactive tenants/lessees by 

Management. Details are as follows:

4.9 Wow Philippines, a tourism marketing campaign project of the DOT, covers the 
regional performances, culture and products of the different provinces in the Philippines 

that were brought, showcased and displayed in Intramuros.  Seven (7) tenants availed 

of this project that was coordinated by the DOT. The Philippine Experience was a tenant 

in Plaza San Luis engaged in tour operation.  While, Hotel and Restaurant Association 

of the Philippines (HRAP) was a former tenant of the IA that leased Houses 5, 6 and 7 

of the Plaza San Luis Complex who handled the operations of Hotel Intramuros and 

Tourism Institutute of the Philippines that addressed the tourism manpower 

development needs of the hotel and restaurant sector of the industry and enhanced the 

value of the district of Intramuros.  Other tenants are individuals selling souvenir items 

in Plaza San Luis.

4.10 From the table, demand letters sent by IA were either Return to Sender (RTS) or pay no 
heed to the demand. However, sending those demand letters were only made during the 

period October 2006 to November 2008 which were more than 12 years ago.  Of the 13 

demand letters sent, eight (8) of which were RTS or with notation that the person no 

longer lives in the area. No other actions were done by IA to locate the whereabouts of 

these tenants thru verifications on file of their addresses at the BIR and/or other 

government agencies. 

 

4.11 Based on the foregoing circumstances, Management is now proactively handling its 
accounts receivable. Management is imposing a stricter measure to avoid and/or prevent 

non-paying tenants or concessioners such as: (1) mandatory four (4) months deposits 

and two (2) months advance payment before leasing the property; and (2) imposing 

penalties and surcharges for the default or delay in payment. These measures were 

validated by the Team based on the submitted signed copies of perfected contracts and 

copies of billing statements wherein a penalty equivalent to two percent (2%) of the 

monthly rental per month of delay until fully paid is imposed by IA. 

 

4.12 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) religiously monitor the status of filed cases and exert more effort in 
demanding and collecting the long-outstanding receivables without court 

cases in the earliest possible time for the best interest of the Administration; 

and 

 

b) direct the Business Management Division to exhaust all possible means to 
secure information needed to locate the whereabouts of the tenants/ lessees/ 

concessionaires before serving demand letters. If warranted, seek the 

assistance of other government offices that can provide information needed in 

serving demand letters and/or in filing appropriate legal actions as deemed 

necessary.  
 

 

Unutilized fund transfers for the projects not returned to the Source Government Agencies 

 

5. IA was unable to return the unutilized balances of funds transferred for specific 
projects by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) and the 

Department of Tourism (DOT) in the total amount of P7,017,133.80 in spite of the 

completion of the projects contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013 

dated December 13, 1994. 
 

5.1 COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 provides that “the Implementing 
Agency shall return to the Source Agency any unused balance upon completion of the 

project.” 

 

5.2 As of December 31, 2020, the Due to NGAs account of IA amounted to P7,017,133.80,  
with breakdown as follows:

5.3 Accounting records showed that the unused balance of fund transfer received from 
NCCA in the amount of P6,778,889.16 was not yet returned despite completion of the 

construction project of the Museo De Intramuros on February 1, 2017. The details are

5.4 A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was entered into between the IA and NCCA 
dated November 17, 2009 for the implementation of “Construction of an Ecclesiastical 

Museum for the IA Collection” or more specifically the Reconstruction of San Ignacio 

Convent as Ecclesiastical Museum. The MOA provides the condition that a fund 

transfer will be made by NCCA to IA, which shall be used solely for the approved 

expenditures listed in the MOA.  

 

5.5 The project was implemented by J. Bros Construction and was reported substantially 
completed by Management on February 1, 2017. The Reconstruction of San Ignacio 

Convent as Ecclesiastical Museum with contract amount of P85,838,838.88 incurred 

substantial delay from its original contract completion date on November 27, 2013  

resulting in advance payment of P3,207,058.35 not recouped and the IA’s computed 

liquidated damages of P3,670,866.46. 

 

5.6 Inquiry with the Accountant disclosed that the reason why the said amount of 
P6,778,889.16 was not yet returned to NCCA is because J. Bros Construction has 

requested reconsideration on the liquidated damages of P3,670,866.46 imposed to them 

by IA due to delayed completion of the project. The Agency stood firm on their 

computations; hence, Check No. 1341498 dated October 31, 2019 in the amount of 

P689,590.54 representing final payment for the project was not claimed by the 

contractor.  The details of computation are as follows:

5.7 Allegedly, several attempts were already done to inform the contractor to get their check 
until it got staled. The Accountant committed to the Audit Team that the remaining 

amount pertaining to NCCA’s unutilized fund transfer to IA will be returned 

immediately to the Source Agency.  

 

5.8 The Audit Team informed IA that since the contractor refused to claim the final 
payment, the Accountant can record the amount as Accounts Payable (AP) and return 

the unutilized balance of the fund transfer.  

 

5.9 This is a reiteration of last year audit observation. 
 

5.10 In addition to the above, the Due to NGAs account balance also includes the 
P238,244.64 remaining balance of the fund transferred on December 28, 2015 for the 

Branding Campaign Project of the DOT wherein the IA received financial assistance 

from DOT for the promotional events in Intramuros. 

 

5.11 Accordingly, the Management did not return the said amount since it is a continuing 
project of the DOT’s branding campaign. 

 

5.12 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a) immediately initiate the return of the unutilized balance of the fund transfer 
after deducting all existing valid obligations of the Administration such as the 

unclaimed final payment of the contractor and thereafter to submit the 

corresponding report of liquidation to close the account pertaining to the 

NCCA fund transfer; and 

  

b) return the remaining balance of the fund transfer from DOT immediately 
after settlement of valid obligations pertaining to CY 2020 and prior years to 

close the IA’s account with DOT. 

 

5.13 Management promised to return the unused balances amounting to P6,089,298.62 and 
P238,244.64 to NCCA and DOT, respectively.  Also, a Journal Entry Voucher No. 161-

2021-01-147 dated January 31, 2021 in the amount of P689,590.54 was already 

prepared to record the final payment of the contractor as Accounts Payable.

Improper maintenance in the Revolving Fund account instead of Modified Disbursement 

System (MDS) Trust of fund transfers from other Governments Agencies  

 

6. The Revolving Fund of IA established pursuant to Section 14 of Presidential 
Decree (PD) No. 1616 and accounted under the Cash in Bank–Local Currency 

Current Account (LCCA) with a balance of P22,348,077.26 includes deposits of 

fund transfers from other government agencies amounting to P8,512,277.05 which 

is contrary to Executive Order (EO) No. 55 Series of 2011 prescribing the use of 

an MDS Trust Account. 
 

6.1 Section 14 of PD No. 1616,  which created the IA for purposes of restoring and 
administering the development of Intramuros, provides that the agency is authorized to 

establish a Revolving Fund (RF) into which shall accrue revenues from operating and 

commercial transactions undertaken by the Administration. Such revenues shall be 

automatically appropriated to cover expenses incurred in such commercial operations, 

subject to pertinent budget compensation accounting, and audit laws and regulations. 

(emphasis ours) 

 

6.2 Pursuant to EO No. 55 Series of 2011 which mandates the establishment of a Treasury 
Single Account (TSA) System for a more effective way of cash management and the 

rationalization of agency bank accounts, the BTr only authorizes the opening and 

maintaining of accounts outside of the TSA if there is sufficient legal basis expressly 

stating that an agency is allowed to open a real account for the receipts and 

disbursements of specific project. Hence, it is advised to open an MDS Trust Account 

wherein the downloading of funds from the Source Agency and the disbursement of 

funds to settle payments incurred for the project/s will be done within the MDS 

framework following this process: 

 

(a) The Source Agency will remit the funds to the BTr and provide copy of 

deposited collections with proper UACS code for Inter Agency Transferred 

Funds (IATF); 

(b) BTr will issue certification confirming the receipt of funds; 

(c) The Agency will request Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) from the DBM using 

the certification from the BTr; and 

(d) Funds will be credited to the opened MDS Trust Account. 

6.3 On the other hand, Cash-Modified Disbursement System (MDS), Trust is used to 
recognize in the agency books the NCA received for trust receipts/fund transfers 

deposited with the National Treasury (NT). 

 

6.4.     The IA, as authorized under PD No. 1616, maintains its RF with account number LBP 

CA No. 0012-1074-12 and accounted under Cash in Bank-Local Currency Current 

Account (CIB-LCCA) with a total balance of P22,348,077.26 as of December 31, 2020. 

The LBP account is maintained by IA for the deposits of collections from its gated 

facilities; collections from venue and function halls; rental/lease fees from 



61 

 

concessionaires; permit fees; clearances fees; interest income; and other business 

income. 

 

6.5      The IA, as authorized under PD No. 1616, maintains its RF with account number LBP 

CA No. 0012-1074-12 and accounted under Cash in Bank-Local Currency Current 

Account (CIB-LCCA) with a total balance of P22,348,077.26 as of December 31, 2020. 

The LBP account is maintained by IA for the deposits of collections from its gated 

facilities; collections from venue and function halls; rental/lease fees from 

concessionaires; permit fees; clearances fees; interest income; and other business 

income. 

 

6.6     Verification showed that the IA has no MDS Trust Account maintained for its trust 

receipts from other government agencies but instead made use of the RF bank account.  

The same account is also used in recording the related fund transfers' expenditures 

withdrawn from the RF LBP LCCA during the year amounting to P439,334.63, with  

details presented below. 

 

 

6.7 As at December 31, 2020, the CIB-LCCA for RF includes an outstanding balance of 
P8,512,277.05, which pertains to the balances of the following fund transfers from other 

government agencies for the implementation of specific projects:

6.8 Inquiry with the Accountant disclosed that they have maintained a Trust Liability 
Account (TLA) way back in 1980’s or 1990’s for fund transfer purposes. However, such 

account was closed by Management when it remained dormant for several years. Hence, 

it has been the practice of the Management to record deposit of fund transfers in the CIB-

LCCA under RF due to the tedious procedure of opening a new account. 

 

6.9 Consequently, the receipts and utilization transactions on fund transfers by the TIEZA, 
NCCA and DOT are with the RF bank account and corresponding recording thereof are 

with the CIB-LCCA account. Hence, the true/accurate balance of CIB-LCCA of IA 

exclusively for the RF was not properly shown in the financial statements as it does not 

only pertain to the revenues generated from IA’s operations. 

 

6.10 As a result of this practice, the objective of the government that agencies shall promote 
transparency in public management was defeated as there is merging of funds between 

the income from IA’s collections and the fund transfers. 

 

6.11 More so, absent the MDS Trust Account maintained for trust receipts from other 
government agencies and making use of the RF LCCA on fund transfers and payments 

incurred therefrom is not within the TSA framework for an effective cash management 

as provided in EO No. 55 s.2011. 

 

6.12 We recommended and Management agreed to coordinate with the BTr as regard 
the opening of the MDS Trust Account for fund transfers received and the 

payments incurred therefrom in accordance with EO No. 55, series of 2011. 

  

 

Unascertained validity of Parking Concession Contracts 

 

7 Parking Concession Contracts with Intramuros Administration Employees 
Association (INTRADEA) lack the required/necessary contract documents which 

were not submitted for audit purposes contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001 

dated June 14, 2012 and the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) 

of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184; hence, validity of the said contract agreements 

cannot be established. Likewise, INTRADEA is IA’s Employees Association 

wherein all its employees are members, thus, the interest of the government is at 

stake. 

 

7.1    Section 9 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 enumerates the 

documentary requirements for common government transactions to be submitted to the 

Auditor by the agency concerned.  On the other hand, Sections 17.1 and 25.1 of the 

RIRR of RA No. 9184 provides the composition of the Bidding Documents and contents 

of financial and technical components of the bid. 

 

7.2       Review of the Parking Concession Contracts with INTRADEA disclosed that IA merely 

submitted a two- page Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) entered into by and between 

the IA and the INTRADEA to the Office of the Auditor without any 



63 

 

supporting/necessary documents of the said contract contrary to the  above-cited 

regulations, hence we could not give our conclusion on the validity of the MOA. 

Summary of the submitted documents are as follows: 

 

MOA 
Monthly Concession Fees 

(in PhP) 
Remarks 

MOA dated April 10, 2015 92,767.50 Based on the submitted  MOA and Summary of 

Estimated Cost of concession fee for parking areas 

in Intramuros 
MOA dated October 10, 2019 70,092.00 

 

7.3 The INTRADEA is an Employees’ Association of the Intramuros Administration 
wherein all IA employees are members. Thus, the Audit Team could not discount the 

possibility of personal interest of the Head of the Procuring Entity (HOPE), Bids and 

Awards Committee (BAC) officers and the Secretariat and Technical Working Groups 

(TWGs) for the inclusion of INTRADEA as concessionaire of the parking facilities. 

 

7.4 As noted, the monthly concession fees (MCF) being paid by INTRADEA was reduced 
to P70,092.00 from the original P92,767.50. Further, it is worthy to note that the COA 

Audit Team in previous Annual Audit Reports emphasized the issue on income 

opportunity loss from the IA’s street parking project and that no plans of action from 

Management have successfully carried out since no new contract with reasonable rate 

increase was concluded.  

 

7.5 In 2008, the Parking Concession Contract of IA with Kalang Maju Philippines 
Corporation (KMPC) provided an MCF of P180,925.00. Likewise, in CY 2013, the 

Commander Automation and Electronics Security System, Incorporated (CAESSI) 

proposal as MCF was already P409,325.82. Although, at that time, CAESSI was the 

only eligible bidder in the June 28, 2013 bidding, the same was declared as a failed 

bidding due to CAESSI’s lack of the required number of years of experience. 

 

7.6 As a result, the KMPC contract has been extended for several times. However, on   
March 3, 2015, the IA implemented the World Bank’s recommendation, regarding the 

traffic and mobility study, to phase out and shift from on-streets to off-streets parking. 

This initiative was for the purpose of providing permanent and lasting solutions that 

support IA’s vision as a walkable and pedestrian-friendly environment. As a result of 

this change, KMPC was affected primarily due to the reduction of the on-street parking. 

Hence, KMPC became delinquent in paying its monthly fees and led to eventual 

termination of the parking concession contract on September 30, 2015. 

 

7.7 Consequently, IA temporarily allowed the INTRADEA to take over the management of 
the parking services as an interim measure until the new concessioner is chosen. From 

then on, INTRADEA took charge as concessionaire of the Parking areas up to this time. 

The following are the concessioners of IA with their corresponding monthly concession 

fees since 2008 to present:

7.8 As can be observed from the above table, the MCF on the concession gradually 
decreased when the INTRADEA took over as concessionaire of these parking facilities. 

The computation of the above MCF was computed by the IA Management estimating 

that 50 percent and 90 percent of the parking space/site will be occupied in 2015 and 

2019, respectively. Computations by the IA Management are presented in the next table.

7.9 As can be observed from the foregoing computation, in 2015 the IA Management 
estimated 50 percent occupancy rates in all its parking with different turnover; hence, 

they arrived at the MCF of P92,767.50. But the computation itself is erroneous because 

the total monthly income should be P213,885.00, while Management only provided in 

its contract a total of P185,535.00. It may be a computational error, but this is crucial, 



65 

 

because the total monthly income was used as basis in computing the MCF. The IA 

Management came up with P92,767.50 by multiplying 50 percent of the total computed 

income. The Audit Team, on the other hand, came up with a total of P106,942.50 also 

by multiplying the Audit Team’s computed total income. Hence, a difference of 

P14,175.00 per month. 

 

7.10 In 2019, the IA Management already increased its estimated occupancy rates in all its 
parking to 90 percent, however, with no turnover. So, the Management merely assumed 

that there will be only 1 car per parking space per day.  

 

7.11 It is the view of the Audit Team that a higher percentage of estimates of occupancy rate 
and turnover is necessary to get the MCF that is more reasonable and realistic. Being in 

the IA all the time, the Audit Team has observed and seen the influx of tourists in the 

said Walled City. It is also of public knowledge that Intramuros is one of the most visited 

places in Manila and this fact can be attested by the revenues/collections made by the 

IA in its gated facilities as reported in the FS submitted by IA and as reflected in the 

CYs 2008 to 2019 Annual Audit Reports, summarized as follows: 

 

Year 
Revenues/Collections 

(in PhP) 

2008               24,609,984.65  

2009               32,477,098.35  

2010               34,527,563.56  

2011               37,369,089.47  

2012               39,321,375.10  

2013               36,513,831.41  

2014               38,450,947.03  

2015               40,556,330.28  

2016               40,133,072.81  

2017               43,347,927.54  

2018               54,976,641.46  

2019               60,726,849.50  

2020               25,329,076.00  

 

7.12 It can be discerned that from the year 2015 to present, there is an increasing number of 
tourists in the IA, except in the year 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Taking into 

consideration these data, it is probable that the occupancy rate of IA parking space/site 

would exceed 50 percent or even attain its 100 percent capacity of parking space. The 

same way, its turnover capacity shall not be barely one (1) car per parking space per 

day. Therefore, increasing the estimated occupancy rate of the parking space for the 

purpose of arriving at reasonable and realistic MCF is indeed necessary for the benefit 

of the government and public and will eventually benefit the IA as the collections from 

parking concessions will be deposited in the RF. 

 

7.13 The following are the sample computation of increase in estimated percentage of 
occupancy and turnover to arrive at a more reasonable and realistic MCF:

7.14 The above table shows that by increasing the estimated occupancy rate to 70 percent 
and turnover capacity rate to three (3), the MCF will drastically change. The above table 

also shows the monthly opportunity loss of IA had it reasonably and realistically 

imposed MCF. The Audit Team’s computed MCF for 2019 is already P656,964.00 

while the IA only imposed P70,092.00 or a difference of P586,872.00 monthly. This 

observation regarding income opportunity loss of IA from the parking concession’s 

contract had already been discussed/raised by the previous COA Auditors to the then 

IA Management. 

 

7.15 The INTRADEA is actually owned by IA employees, hence, it could be presumed that 
the actual income of the parking area is known to the officials of IA. Thereby, should 

the Management opted to properly charge a more reasonable concession fee, they could 

have easily based it on the average of actual income rather than estimating a 

significantly low income. 

 

7.16 Explicit under Section 2 of PD No. 1445 that it is the declared policy of the State that 
all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance 

with law and regulations, and safeguard against loss or wastage through illegal or 

improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in 

the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is 

faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency 

concerned. 

 

7.17 We recommended that Management direct the BAC, BAC Secretariat and/or 
TWG to:  
 

a) submit the authenticated copies of the contract documents including all the 
required attachments as provided under Sections 17.1 and 25.1 of the RIRR 

of RA No. 9184 on the Parking Concession Contracts with INTRADEA; and 
 

b) ensure that all property leased out to private persons or other entity are duly 
charged with a reasonable rental fee and that equitable return on 

government’s investment on construction and maintenance are duly 

obtained.

7.18 Management commented that they will make the necessary survey on vehicles parking 
in parking areas to arrive at more or less accurate statistics on parkers, and submit this 

to the Audit Team. They will also provide the contracts with INTRADEA for 2017 and 

2019. Other necessary documents were already submitted to the Audit Team in reply to 

the AOM. IA Management shall ensure that all properties of IA under concession 

agreements shall not be prejudicial to the interests of the IA and the government as a 

whole. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

7.19 It is requested that Management submit all the documents regarding the Parking 
Concession Contracts with INTRADEA since 2015 in order for us to further evaluate 

and review the said contracts. The same will also be forwarded to the COA–Technical 

Services Office in order to evaluate the reasonableness of the parking concession 

contracts. We also request that all documents to be submitted are authenticated copies 

of the original. 

 

 

Properties not covered with insurance 

 

8 The IA’s insurable properties with carrying value of P234,025,781.06 as of 
December 31, 2020 were not adequately covered/insured with the General 

Insurance Fund of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) exposing the 

subject properties to the risks of non-indemnification in cases of damage/loss to 

properties due to fortuitous events or other casualty. Also, Management was not 

able to properly assess and evaluate the Appraised Value of antique items due to 

the absence of an Appraiser resulting in the inability to determine the cost of 

insurance premiums.  

 

8.1       COA Circular No. 92-390 dated November 17, 1992 and RA No. 656, otherwise known 

as Property Insurance Law, as amended by PD No. 245, require all government agencies 

to conduct inventory of these physical assets and to insure with the General Insurance 

Fund of GSIS all its insurable property against any insurable risk and pay the 

corresponding premiums thereon. 

 

8.2     Section 11 of RA No. 656 also provides that each government as defined herein shall 

include in its annual appropriation the amount necessary to cover the premiums for the 

insurance of its properties during each fiscal period and remit the same immediately to 

the System as provided in Section 10 hereof. 

 

8.3 In addition, as can be viewed from the GSIS site, the GSIS offers insurance for movable 
properties known as GSIS Property Floater, a general insurance product, covering all 

movable properties of government that must be insured. The GSIS insures these 

properties for as long as the movable property is related to government undertakings. 

All risks of direct physical loss or damage from any external cause to the insured 

property such as General Average and Salvage Charges are covered.  



68 

 

8.4 Below are the types of movable properties of government that must be insured with 
GSIS: 

 

 Type A - 
 

Heavy Equipment, Road Rollers, Dump Trucks, Garbage 

Compactors,    similar vehicle (not regularly utilizing public 

highways) 

 Type B - 
 

Drilling Equipment, Pumps, Electronic Toll Booth equipment, 

Generator sets, Construction equipment 

 Type C - 
 

X-ray machines (cartwheel type), stationary, medicine palletizing 

equipment 

 Type D - Cell Phones, communication equipment, firearms, computer 
(laptop), etc. 

 Type E - 
 

Heavy Vehicles/Testing vehicles regularly utilizing the public 

roads, such as garbage dump truck, smoke belching/environment 

testing vehicles 

 

8.6    Review of records showed that IA has nine (9) insurance policies for nine (9) of its 
buildings located at Plaza San Luis (PSL) Complex and seven (7) Motor Vehicles. 

The other properties of IA were not insured. Details are shown below.

8.7 Verification showed that the insurance of IA’s physical assets with carrying value of 
P234,025,781.06 only covers up to P218,225,575.17. The Agency failed to insure with 

the GSIS some of its Insurable Properties due to the absence of funding in its annual 

appropriations corresponding to the amount necessary to cover the insurance premiums 

of these properties. 
 

8.8 It was noted that the list of properties not insured/covered by an insurance policy 
includes the movable properties of the IA, such as but not limited to desktops, laptops, 

printers and other portable/hand-held equipment, located at the 5th floor PDG Building 

and PSL Complex. 

 

8.9 Moreover, the Works of Arts or high value antique items of IA were not covered by 
insurance policies. The non-renewal of Insurance Policy for various Antique 

Collections (Works of Arts) for the period January 1 to December 31, 2020 was due to 

the failure of IA to include in its funding request to the DBM, the allocation of insurance 

fund in the IA’s regular Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses for FY 2020 GAA. 

 

8.10 The inadequate insurance for all insurable properties of IA does not only deprive the 
agency of sufficient and reliable protection against any damage to or loss of these 

properties but ultimately exposes the agency to unnecessary losses due to non-

indemnification in the event of direct physical loss or damage from any external causes. 

 

8.11 Management, on the other hand, commented that they have communicated with the 
DBM to include in the yearly budget proposal the requirements for the insurance 

premiums of their insurable assets/properties but their requests were not given due 

consideration. In the previous years, the insurance premiums for their antique items is 

part of their regular MOOE, even if the basis of the budget allocation was the acquisition 

cost of these items. Management further commented that in their budget proposal 

submitted to DBM, they increased their proposal for insurance premiums to cover the 

other assets/properties that the COA had recommended, but the request was not 

considered. This was the reason why they have to terminate the insurance policy they 

had with GSIS for their antique items. 

 

8.12 Intramuros is a priceless heritage of the past for the City of Manila and a major historical 
landmark of the Philippines. IA was mandated under PD No. 1616 to preserve and 

enhance its historical value. This includes the preservation of several Works of Art and 

Archeological Specimen which are held for their cultural and historical significance. 

Unlike other properties, these assets have no replacement value,  unique and 

irreplaceable. 

 

8.13 When acquiring insurance for these assets, the ideal would be to consult an independent 
professional such as an appraiser to estimate the value of the pieces so that the value 

stated in the insurance policy would be sufficient to cover the current/true worth/value 

of these properties. 

 



70 

 

8.14 IA reported the book balance of Works of Arts and Archeological Specimen account in 
the amount of P36,159,939.00 using the cost model. However, these thousands of 

paintings, sculptures, and archaeological specimen were not insured. These antiques 

were appraised last July 2008 through the effort of the then Administrator, wherein the 

partial Appraised Value of these items already totaled to P118,846,450.00 or three (3) 

times more than its current carrying value.  

 

8.15 However, current update on the appraisal of its antique collections was not yet 
conducted despite Management’s commitment to hire an Appraiser to determine its 

current value and recognize the needed increase in premiums. Management commented 

that there was no sufficient fund to cover the hiring of an Appraiser; hence, they only 

relied on the carrying value of the said antiques when applying for the insurance of the 

same. Failure to update the appraisal value of these antique collections would expose 

IA to the risk of not recovering the current/true worth/value of these antiques in the 

event of loss or damage.  

 

8.16 IA Management may coordinate with other government agencies like the National 
Museum of the Philippines (NMP) or Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) which 

also owned priceless and precious Works of Arts in their asset account in order to know 

where to secure a reliable yet efficient and economical independent professional 

appraiser, who will be hired to conduct the appraisal of these assets to determine its 

current market value, which will be the basis for the request of funding to DBM for the 

insurance and to book up the correct value of these properties. 

 

8.17 Management commented that their proposal to engage an independent appraiser to 
assess and evaluate the appraised value of their antique items was set aside by the DBM 

due to the non-allocation of funds to cover the cost of engaging the services of an 

appraiser which rate is between one (1) percent to two percent (2%) of the total 

appraised value based on the market survey of the Museum staff. 

 

8.18 Moreover, review of records showed that IA has three (3) motorcycle vehicles in its 
possession, two (2) of which were not insured for CY 2020 due to the COVID-19 

pandemic while the other one was renewed. Details are as follows:

8.19 Based on the above data, IA was able to insure one (1) motorcycle vehicle despite the 
COVID-19 pandemic but failed to renew the insurance policies of the two (2) remaining 

motorcycles for that same reason. While we understand the IA’s failure to properly 

monitor its’ insurance policies due to the changes and difficulties brought by the 

pandemic, still it is their duty to determine what are to be insured so that in cases of any 

accidents or loss, subject properties will be properly indemnified by the GSIS. 

 

8.20 We recommended that Management: 
 

a) coordinate with other Agencies like the NMP or CCP which have Works of 
Arts and Archeological Specimen in their assets on how to secure reliable, yet 

efficient and economical independent professional Appraiser in order to 

ensure the correct valuation of the antique collections and assets under the 

custody of IA and which would be used for the appropriate insurance coverage 

with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS;  

 

b) make representation with the DBM to allocate funds and incorporate in the 
annual budget of the Agency the amount necessary to cover the increase in 

premium relative to the additional insurance coverage for all its insurable 

properties with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS including the Works 

of Arts and Archeological Specimen, to ensure that the government will be 

indemnified for any damage or loss of these assets; and 

 

c) instruct the General Services Division to implement timely renewal of 
insurance policies for all Agency’s insurable properties despite the challenges 

of the pandemic to avoid any unnecessary losses due to non-indemnification in 

the event of direct physical loss or damage from any external cause. 

 

8.21 Management commented that as regards the recommendation to coordinate with the 
NMP on the appraisal of their Works of Arts and Archaeological Specimen in their 

assets, the Management had coordinated with NMP and that they were informed that 

their works of art were also not insured and only their buildings are covered due to cost 

entails of the insurance premiums. The NMP had not engaged any appraiser as well.   

 

8.22 Further, the yearly budget proposal submitted to the DBM consistently included the 
budget for the insurance premiums of IA’s properties but unfortunately, the proposal 

was not granted.  They also commented that for FY 2022, they have earmarked the 

amount of P8M for the insurance of these properties and for possible engagement of an 

appraiser to fully comply with the audit recommendations. Management has submitted 

photocopies of their budget proposals for the past years for reference of the Audit Team.

Deficiencies in Cash Management 

 

9 The following are the deficiencies noted in Cash Management contrary to prescribed 
accounting standards and other related government rules and regulations: 

 

Standards  
Observations and Management 

Comment/s 
Recommendations 

Issuance of Official Receipts  

Section 4(h), Chapter 2, 

Volume I of the GAM for 

NGAs states that, “Pre-

numbered ORs shall be issued 

in strict numerical sequence. 

All copies of each receipt shall 

be exact copies or carbon 

reproduction in all respects of 

the original.” 

 

Also, Section 39, Chapter V, 

Volume I of the GAM for 

NGAs provides that, “At the 

close of the business day, the 

Collecting Officers shall 

prepare the Report of 

Collections and Deposits 

(RCD) (Appendix 26) for 

submission to Accounting 

Office/Unit. The report lists all 

the ORs issued in numerical 

sequence including cancelled 

ones.” 

 

Sharing of Official Receipts (ORs) as 

an alternative to the issuance of Green 

Tickets, between the two (2) Ticket 

Attendants was resorted to due to 

insufficient supply of tickets. The 

practices resulted in ORs being issued 

in non-numerical sequence 

contravening Section 4(h), Chapter 2, 

Volume I of the GAM for NGAs 

which requires that ORs shall be 

issued in strict numerical sequence. 

 

Due to ticket shortage, the Ticket 

Attendant assigned at San Diego 

Plaza was prompted   to borrow from 

the Ticket Attendant from Casa 

Manila Museum few ORs as   

alternative in issuing the Green 

Tickets which are issued as entrance 

fee at San Diego Gardens.    

 

The sharing of ORs between the two 

(2) attendants, however,   resulted in 

disorganized issuances of ORs and 

difficulty in distinguishing the 

accountability and reconciliation of 

sales in San Diego Plaza and Casa 

Manila Museum.  

 

Management commented that they 

admit the shortage of tickets for San 

Diego Gardens during the later part of 

2019 and the first quarter of 2020 due 

to the influx of visitors to Intramuros.  

It is not their intention to disregard the 

requirement of COA, however, they 

were compelled to use the official 

receipts in lieu of the tickets to 

account for the entry of visitors’ 

request for official receipts.  

 

While the sequential issuance of OR 

is necessary, non-numerical 

sequencing could not be avoided in 

the situation as there were different 

sets of booklets issued to three (3) 

attendants utilizing the official 

We recommended and 

Management agreed to 

provide the Accountable 

Officers enough supply of 

tickets based on their 

previous collections to 

avoid sharing of ORs and 

the difficulty          in 

distinguishing the 

accountability and 

reconciliation of sales will 

be likewise be solved.

receipts in three (3) different locations 

on different time/period. - Palacio 

office which is open during weekends 

and Plaza San Luis Complex and San 

Diego Gardens which are open every 

Mondays to Fridays. 

It is worth noting however, that all 

official receipts issued, though were 

not issued in sequential manner, were 

duly accounted and deposited by the 

collecting officer and   no cash 

shortage was reported and validated 

by COA. 

 

Bonding of Head, GSS 

Section 101 of PD 1445 

provides that every officer of 

any government agency whose 

duties permit or require the 

possession or custody of 

government funds or property 

shall be accountable therefor 

and for the safekeeping thereof 

in conformity with law.  Also, 

every accountable officer shall 

be properly bonded in 

accordance with law. 

 

Item 5.1 of Treasury Circular 

(TC) No. 02-2009 dated 

August 6, 2009 provides that, 

“The amount of bond shall be 

based on the total 

accountability (cash, property, 

and accountable forms) of the 

accountable officer as 

determined by the head of the 

agency.” Likewise, Annex C 

of the said Circular provides 

the Revised Schedule of 

Premium Rates for the 

effective bonding of 

accountable public officers 

pursuant to the provisions of 

the Public Bonding Law. 

 

The Head, GSS of IA who is an 

accountable officer is not bonded as 

required by law, thereby exposing the 

government to risk of not being fully 

indemnified in case of defalcation, 

shortage or loss.  

 

A new, Administrative Officer IV, of 

the Finance and Administrative 

Division is designated as Head of the 

GSS pursuant to IA Office Order No. 

04-10-2020 dated October 8, 2020 

who is tasked to oversee the day to 

day operation of the GSU and to sign  

documents.   

 

At present, the Head, GSS was 

bonded as Petty Cash Fund Custodian 

(PCFC) under Risk No. D1E-20-

1003R effective October 12, 2020 to 

October 12, 2021 with an approved 

amount of bond of P30,000.00 and 

with maximum cash accountability of 

P40,000.00. However, the bond is 

considered to be insufficient as she is 

now  the Head of the GSS with higher 

accountability. 

 

Inquiry  revealed that the Head, GSS 

assumed her post on October 24, 

2020. However,  she was not aware 

that she should be bonded with higher 

maximum accountability, hence, she 

did not apply for bond, putting the 

agency at risk of not being fully 

indemnified in cases of defalcations, 

shortages, and unrelieved losses.  

 

We recommended that 

Management require the 

Head of GSS to apply for 

bond in accordance to 

Section 101 of PD No. 1445 

and TC No. 02-2009.

Compliance with Other Government Rules and Regulations  

 

10 Below is the status of IA’s compliance with other laws, rules and regulations (LRRs): 
 

LRRs 
Audit Observations and 

Recommendations 

Gender and Development 

Section 31 of RA No. 11465 or otherwise 

known as the GAA of FY 2020 requires, 

among others, all agencies of the government 

to integrate GAD Plan in the regular activities 

of the agencies and allocate at least five 

percent (5%) of their budgets.  

 

PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-

01 which prescribes the guidelines for the 

preparation of Annual GAD Plan and Budget 

(GPB), requires the submission of the GPB 

duly reviewed by GAD Focal Point System 

(GFPS) to the PCW for review prior to the 

submission of the agency budget proposal to 

the Department of Budget and Management 

(DBM), which served as the basis for 

implementing the GPB as well as monitoring 

and reporting.  

For CY 2020, IA incurred total expenditures of 

P16,165,186.14, representing 22.97 percent of its five percent 

(5%) required budget of P70,390,100.00, for 12 GAD-related 

activities, 10 of which were implemented while two (2) were 

partially implemented.   

 

Validation of the CY 2020 Accomplishment Report (AR) on 

GAD showed that 10 of the 12 target GAD activities were 

implemented while the two (2) were partially implemented 

because the number of target participants were not met,  as

Inquiry with the GFPS revealed that the main reason that there 

were few participants in the said activities were due to 

limited/poor access to wifi or internet connection at home, lack 

of gadgets and low mobile data capacity. 

 

While it is true that COVID-19 pandemic has caused 

lockdowns and community quarantines which prompted IA 

personnel to work from home to avoid the virus, IA should 

oblige its personnel to attend the seminars/ workshops or 

learning sessions where they were scheduled to attend.  

 

The reason for non-availability of gadgets, wifi and mobile 

data are no longer acceptable because those things are already 

a necessity in today’s era, so only a few would probably be not 

able to afford them. If some personnel do not have laptops, 

smart phones, wifi or poor internet connection at home or low 

mobile data, then IA can arrange that they come to office in 

order to attend the said seminar/workshop.

LRRs 
Audit Observations and 

Recommendations 

Moreover, in compliance to PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular 

No. 2012-01, a computer-generated copy of the Annual GAD 

Plan and Budget (GPB) for CY 2020 was submitted to the 

Audit Team on February 21, 2020. The IA GPB for CY 2020 

was endorsed by the PCW on March 25, 2020 and the Annual 

GAD Accomplishment Report pending approval by the PCW 

was submitted to the audit team on February 4, 2021. The 

Annual GAD Accomplishment Report for CY 2020 was 

submitted through online system on the scheduled date of 

March 12, 2021. 

 

We commended Management for allocating more than five 

percent (5%) of the Agency’s budget for the 

implementation of GAD activities and submitting the GAD 

Plans and Budget and GAD AR on time.  Henceforth, we 

recommended that Management oblige IA personnel to 

attend the scheduled online seminars/ workshops. 

 

Programs and Projects related to Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability 

Section 32 of the General Provisions of the 

GAA of FY 2020 or RA No. 11465 states that 

“all agencies of the government shall 

formulate plans, programs and projects 

intended to address the concerns of senior 

citizens (SCs) and persons with disability 

(PWDs), insofar as related to their mandated 

functions, and integrate the same in their 

regular activities.” 

For CY 2020,  IA was able to grant a special discount of 

P50.00 or  a total discount of P330,450.00 to 6,609 SCs and 

differently-abled persons who visited the park and museum 

from January to March 2020 or the period prior to the 

lockdown in NCR due to COVID-19 pandemic.   No other 

activities were reported that would address the concerns of SCs 

and differently-abled persons, thus, depriving the officers and 

employees and the general public who are senior citizens and 

differently-abled persons of the social, health and economic 

benefits that could have been derived from the program had IA 

formulated plans, programs and projects in line with the 

current situation and challenges posed by the COVID-19 

pandemic. 

 

Inquiry with the Management revealed that while it is true that 

the report they submitted on the matter only reflected the 

discount they extended to SCs and PWDs and no specific 

activities conducted, which they normally extended to these 

people, it was because of the unexpected irregular operation of 

their office due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

Management further commented that it is the Tourism 

Promotions Division (TPD) that regularly coordinates and 

conducts free tours with the SCs and differently-abled persons. 

Other divisions of the IA handle the improvement of structures 

or facilities that include upgrading of ramps, additional 

benches and lightning of the parks and plaza. They also ensure 

that enough wheelchairs are available when needed.  

 

Management assured the Audit Team that once normal 

operation is back, the usual programs/ projects/activities will 

all resume and be provided to the SCs and differently-abled 

persons like free tours, discounts and wheelchairs.

LRRs 
Audit Observations and 

Recommendations 

While it is true that the COVID 19 pandemic has caused the 

closure of public places and establishments due to lockdowns 

and Enhanced/Modified/General Community Quarantine, the 

Audit Team believes that IA should consider the provision of 

appropriate strategies amidst challenges posed by the COVID-

19 pandemic to comply with Section 32 of the GAA of FY 

2020. 

 

We recommended that Management formulate plans, 

programs and projects intended to address the concerns of 

the SCs and PWDs to fully comply with Section 32 of the 

General Provisions of the GAA of FY 2020 or RA No. 

11465.   

 

Compliance with Tax Laws 

BIR Revenue Regulation No. 1-2013 dated 

January 23, 2013 provides that – “in the case 

of NGAs, all returns must be electronically 

filed (e-filed) and payment of the tax due must 

also be made on the same day the return is e-

filed which shall be on or before the 10th day 

following the month in which withholding 

was made, except for taxes withheld for the 

month of December of each year, which shall 

be filed on or before January 15 of the 

succeeding year.” 

 

Any unremitted taxes withheld within the 

period prescribed exposes the IA to penalties 

and punishments specified on the above-cited 

BIR Revenue Regulation. 

 

The agency has strictly complied with the 

withholding/remittance of taxes within the prescribed 

period.   

 

During the year, taxes withheld amounted to P6,207,157.75 

from the payments of salaries and benefits of employees, 

purchase of supplies/materials, services rendered and other 

disbursements, of which the total amount of P5,497,921.20 

was remitted.   

 

The balance of P709,236.25 representing taxes withheld in 

December 2020 was remitted under TRA Nos. 

0060332021383925, 0060332021384088 and

Enforcement of COA Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 

 

11 Management failed to enforce settlement of final and executory audit disallowances of 

P1,927,887.12 contrary to Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated 

September 15, 2009. 

 

11.1   Section 7.1 of the COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 on the Revised 

Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts (RRSA), provides, among others, that 

the head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property 

pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that the settlement of disallowances and charges is 

made within the prescribed period and all employees who are retiring or transferring to other 

agencies shall first settle the disallowances and charges for which they are liable. 

 

11.2  Also, Section 7.2 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 provides that the Chief Accountant, 

Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping 

functions of the audited agency shall ensure that the audit suspensions, disallowances and 

charges including their settlements are properly monitored. 

 

11.3  As such, the prior years’ balance of Receivables-Disallowances and Charges account

11.4 Despite our prior years’ recommendation that Management enforce settlement of long 
outstanding audit disallowances that are already final and executory, there were no other 

settlements made during the year in view of their failure to exert efforts to demand

settlement/refund from persons liable and secure (a) information needed to locate the 

whereabouts of the persons liable who are already retired from the service for the 

issuance of notice and demand to settle and (b) information/records for the 

disallowances on CY 1989 and prior years. 

 

11.5 Management commented that the non-settlement of the disallowance amounting to 
P1,391,880.66 was due to the pending appeals of the two (2) liable persons; while 

demand letters will be sent to other liable persons with no pending appeals. Meanwhile, 

appropriate demand letters will be also sent to the former IA Administrator regarding 

disallowances amounting to P2,344.00 and P7,200.00. Finally, as regards the 

disallowed amount of P515,541.21, the Management could not find any record on their 

file hence, will coordinate with the Audit Team regarding the names of the person/s 

liable so that demand letters can be sent to them.

11.7 Management informed that for ND Nos. 15-001(14) and 15-001 dated August 28, 2015 
and September 22, 2015 in the amounts of P384,000.00 and P160,000.00, respectively, 

there was already partial and continuous compliance, since members of the PNP who 

have received the same have started paying the disallowed amount since 2019 based on 

the demand letters of Management prior to the issuance of the COA Order of Execution.  

Of the total disallowed amount of P544,000.000, the amount of P199,000.00 as of 

March 31, 2021 has already been settled. Those who still have balances had advised 

Management of their intention to continue paying the same. The Management through 

their letter dated April 26, 2021 has provided the Audit Team with Summary of 

Settlement made by the concerned PNP personnel and the corresponding Official 

Receipts (ORs) as certified by IA Cashier. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

11.8 The Audit Team acknowledged Management’s effort to collect and settle the disallowed 
amount for the payment of Honoraria made to the PNP- Police Community Precinct.  

However, should there be settlement of disallowances, Management should submit 

immediately to the Audit Team the original copies of ORs or other documents to support 

the settlement of disallowance in order for the Audit Team to issue a Notice of 

Settlement for Suspension/Disallowance/Charge (NSSDC) as well as the corresponding 

Statement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges (SASDC)   and   in order 

for the Team to update its records. 

 

11.9 We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation that Management exhaust all 
possible means to secure information needed to locate the whereabouts of the 

persons liable and enforce settlement of all audit disallowances that are already 

final and executory.
