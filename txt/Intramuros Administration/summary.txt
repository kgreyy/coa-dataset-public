 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
   

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Intramuros Administration (IA) was created by virtue of Presidential Decree 

(PD) No. 1616 dated April 10, 1979 for the purpose of restoring and administering the 

development of Intramuros as a monument to the Hispanic period of Philippine History.

virtue of Republic Act (RA) No. 9593 issued on May 12, 2009 also known as the 

“Tourism Act of 2009.” 

 

The IA envisions to preserve Intramuros as a cultural oasis and model heritage 

site, re-awaken a sense of oneness and pride among Filipinos, and ensure partnership 

with the Intramuros community for mutual upliftment towards a well-preserved cultural 

heritage and enriched visitor experience.

 The agency was able to attain 100 percent accomplishment and/or even exceeded 

its target in six (6) out of the 17 activities under the four (4) OOs, while significant 

decreases in the reported accomplishments this year were noted in its 11 activities due to 

Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) pandemic which was beyond the control of the 

Agency.   

 

  However, despite the difficulty of holding physical and face-to-face activities 

during the quarantine period, the Agency was able to switch to online activities and 

created the Intramuros Learning Session webinars aired in 41 episodes, three (3) virtual 

tours in Fort Santiago, San Diego and Casa Manila, the Kulay ng Kasaysayan and other 

online events held from May to December 2020 in order to sustain the promotion 

program of the IA. In turn, the agency was able to conduct 72 promotional events 

surpassing its 49 targets. 

 

 

D. Scope and Objectives of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of IA for the year ended December 

31, 2020. The audit was conducted to (a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed 

on Management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of 

transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and 

regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the 

extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations. 

 

 

E. Report on the Audit of Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements of the IA as at December 31, 2020. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

Summarized below are the significant observations and recommendations, the 

details of which are discussed in Part II of this Report: 

 

1. The accuracy and reliability of the reported year-end balances of Inventories and 
PPE accounts with reported balances of P6,119,301.17 and P254,116,074.64, 

respectively, could not be fully ascertained due to the non-submission of 



vi 

 

reconciled inventory reports as well as the non-maintenance of an updated and 

reconciled records for inventory and property items of the Accounting Unit and 

the General Service Section (GSS). Other control gaps on accountability over the 

assets were also noted. (Observation No. 1) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the:  (a) Head of the GSS 

and the Chief of Business Management Division to schedule the conduct of 

physical count of inventories earlier to give time for reconciliation with the 

Accounting records and submit the Report of Physical Count of Inventory to the 

Office of the Auditor not later than July 31 and January 31 of each year for the 

first and second semesters, respectively; and (b) GSS and the Accounting Unit to 

update and promptly post all transactions from source documents to the respective 

Stock Cards (SCs) and Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs); and henceforth, reconcile 

their records regularly so that any discrepancies can be corrected and validated 

immediately. We also recommended and Management agreed to consider 

assigning additional personnel/staff in the GSS who will assist in the discharge of 

the duties and responsibilities of the Head of the GSS. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the: (a) IA Inventory 

Committee to conduct an annual physical count of PPE and submit a copy of the 

RPCPPE to the Office of the Auditor not later than January 31 of the following 

year in accordance with Section 38, Chapter 10, Volume I of the Government 

Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies (GAM for NGAs); (b) 

GSS to complete and update Property Cards (PCs) and renew Property 

Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) every three (3) years for all PPE items; (c) GSS 

and Accounting Unit to reconcile property and accounting records periodically to 

correct at once any discrepancies noted; and  (d) Accounting Unit to prepare and 

maintain Registry of Heritage Assets and Registry of Heritage Asset-Summary for 

purposes of monitoring accountability on heritage assets. 

 

2. Of the total authorized budget/allotment of P70,646,719.00 received by the IA in 
CY 2020, P69,822,720.45 or 98.83 percent was obligated; however, only 

P52,412,212.12 or 75.06 percent of the obligated allotments was actually 

disbursed due to the delayed implementation of one (1) project and planned 

activities. Of the total cash allocations of P67,411,966.00, P17,577,863.36 or 26 

percent was not utilized which was consequently reverted to the Bureau of the 

Treasury (BTr). (Observation No. 2) 

 

We recommended to Management to fast-track the procurement of supplies and 

implementation of projects to hasten and ensure efficient management of its 

budget and available cash. 

 

3. Only six (6) of IA’s 17 planned activities under the four (4) Organizational 
Outcomes (OOs) were met and/or exceeded the targets, while 11 activities 

registered low accomplishments due to the COVID–19 pandemic which caused 

lockdowns/community quarantines limiting operations, mobility, actions and 



vii 

 

events beyond the control of the Agency. However, the Agency was able to 

sustain the promotion program of Intramuros as it switched to online activities 

and was able to create the Intramuros Learning Session webinars aired in 41 

episodes, three (3) virtual tours in Fort Santiago, San Diego and Casa Manila, the 

Kulay ng Kasaysayan and other online events.  (Observation No. 3) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to continuously monitor the 

accomplishment of IA’s performance targets taking into consideration the 

provision of appropriate strategies amidst challenges posed by the COVID-19 

pandemic to attain fully its target accomplishments in the ensuing year. 

 

4. IA’s Accounts Receivables from its former tenants/lessees/concessionaires 
totaling to P14,948,102.15 were doubtful of collection due to: (a) slow progress of 

filed cases against former tenants/lessees/concessionaires with unsettled accounts 

in the total amount of P12,116,036.51; and (b) inability of IA to locate and to file 

appropriate legal actions for the defaulting tenants/lessees/concessionaires with 

unsettled accounts of P2,832,065.64. (Observation No. 4)  

 

We recommended that Management: (a) religiously monitor the status of filed 

cases and exert more effort in demanding and collecting the long-outstanding 

receivables without court cases in the earliest possible time for the best interest of 

the Administration; and (b) direct the Business Management Division to exhaust 

all possible means to secure information needed to locate the whereabouts of the 

tenants/lessees/concessionaires before serving demand letters. If warranted, seek 

the assistance of other government offices that can provide information needed in 

serving demand letters and/or in filing appropriate legal actions as deemed 

necessary.  

 

5. IA was unable to return the unutilized balances of funds transferred for specific 
projects by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) and the 

DOT in the total amount of P7,017,133.80 in spite of the completion of the 

projects contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 

13, 1994. (Observation No. 5) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) immediately initiate the return 

of the unutilized balance of the fund transfer after deducting all existing valid 

obligations of the Administration such as the unclaimed final payment of the 

contractor and thereafter to submit the corresponding report of liquidation to close 

the account pertaining to the NCCA fund transfer; and (b) return the remaining 

balance of the fund transfer from DOT immediately after settlement of valid 

obligations pertaining to CY 2020 and prior years to close the IA’s account with 

DOT. 

 

6. The Revolving Fund of IA established pursuant to Section 14 of PD No. 1616 and 
accounted under the Cash in Bank–Local Currency Current Account (LCCA) with 

a balance of P22,348,077.26 includes deposits of fund transfers from other 



viii 

 

government agencies amounting to P8,512,277.05 which is contrary to EO No. 55 

Series of 2011 prescribing the use of an Modified Disbursement System (MDS) 

Trust Account. (Observation No. 6) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to coordinate with the BTr as regard 

the opening of the MDS Trust Account for fund transfers received and the 

payments incurred therefrom in accordance with EO No. 55, series of 2011. 

 

7. Parking Concession Contracts with Intramuros Administration Employees 
Association (INTRADEA) lack the required/necessary contract documents which 

were not submitted for audit purposes contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001 

dated June 14, 2012 and the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) 

of RA No. 9184; hence, validity of the said contract agreements cannot be 

established. Likewise, INTRADEA is IA’s Employees Association wherein all its 

employees are members, thus, the interest of the government is at stake. 

(Observation No. 7) 
 

We recommended that Management direct the Bids and Awards Committee 

(BAC), BAC Secretariat and/or TWG to: (a) submit the authenticated copies of 

the contract documents including all the required attachments as provided under 

Sections 17.1 and 25.1 of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 on the Parking Concession 

Contracts with INTRADEA; and (b) ensure that all property leased out to private 

persons or other entity are duly charged with a reasonable rental fee and that 

equitable return on government’s investment on construction and maintenance are 

duly obtained.  

 

8. The IA’s insurable properties with carrying value of P234,025,781.06 as of 
December 31, 2020 were not adequately covered/insured with the General 

Insurance Fund of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) exposing the 

subject properties to the risks of non-indemnification in cases of damage/loss to 

properties due to fortuitous events or other casualty. Also, Management was not 

able to properly assess and evaluate the Appraised Value of antique items due to 

the absence of an Appraiser resulting in the inability to determine the cost of 

insurance premiums. (Observation No. 8) 

 

We recommended that Management: (a) coordinate with other Agencies like the 

National Museum of the Philippines (NMP) or Cultural Center of the Philippines 

(CCP) which have Works of Arts and Archeological Specimen in their assets on 

how to secure reliable, yet efficient and economical independent professional 

Appraiser in order to ensure correct valuation of the antique collections and assets 

under the custody of IA and which would be used for the appropriate insurance 

coverage with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS; (b) make representation 

with the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to allocate funds and 

incorporate in the annual budget of the Agency the amount necessary to cover the 

increase in premium relative to the additional insurance coverage for all its 

insurable properties with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS including the 



ix 

 

Works of Arts and Archeological Specimen, to ensure that the government will be 

indemnified for any damage or loss of these assets; and (c) instruct the General 

Services Division to implement timely renewal of insurance policies for all 

Agency’s insurable properties despite the challenges of the pandemic to avoid any 

unnecessary losses due to non-indemnification in the event of direct physical loss 

or damage from any external cause. 

 

9. Weaknesses on cash and property management of IA were noted such as:           
(a) Sharing of Official Receipts (ORs) as an alternative to the issuance of Green 

Tickets, between the two (2) Ticket Attendants was resorted to due to insufficient 

supply of tickets. The practices resulted in ORs being issued in non-numerical 

sequence contravening Section 4(h), Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs 

which requires that ORs shall be issued in strict numerical sequence; and (b) the 

Head, GSS of IA who is an accountable officer is not bonded as required by law, 

thereby exposing the government to risk of not being fully indemnified in case of 

defalcation, shortage or loss. (Observation No. 9) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) provide the Accountable 

Officers enough supply of tickets based on their previous collections to avoid 

sharing of ORs and difficulty in distinguishing the accountability and 

reconciliation of sales will be likewise be solved; and (b) require the Head of GSS 

to apply for bond in accordance to Section 101 of PD No. 1445 and Treasury 

Circular (TC) No. 02-2009.              

 

10. For CY 2020, IA incurred total expenditures of P16,165,186.14 representing 
22.97 percent of its five percent (5%) required budget of P70,390,100.00 for 12 

Gender and Development (GAD) related activities, 10 of which were 

implemented while two (2) were partially implemented.  (Observation No. 10) 

 

 Henceforth, we recommended that Management oblige IA personnel to attend the 

scheduled online seminars/ workshops. 

 

11.  For CY 2020, IA was able to grant a special discount of P50.00 or a total discount 

of P330,450.00 to 6,609 Senior Citizens (SCs) and differently-abled persons who 

visited the park and museum from January to March 2020 or the period prior to 

the COVID-19 pandemic. No other activities were reported that would address the 

SCs and differently-abled persons were submitted to the Team, thus, depriving the 

officers and employees as well as the general public who are SCs and differently-

abled persons, on the social, health and economic benefits that could have been 

derived from the program had IA formulated plans, programs and projects in line 

with the current situation and challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

(Observation No. 10) 
 

 We recommended that Management formulate plans, programs and projects 

intended to address the concerns of the SCs and persons with disability (PWDs) to 



x 

 

comply with Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA of FY 2020 or RA 

No. 11465.   

 

12. Management failed to enforce settlement of final and executory audit 
disallowances of P1,927,887.12 contrary to Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of COA Circular 

No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009. (Observation No. 11) 

 

We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation that Management exhaust all 

possible means to secure information needed to locate the whereabouts of the 

persons liable and enforce settlement of all audit disallowances that are already 

final and executory. 

 
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the above observations and 

recommendations were communicated with concerned Management officials through the 

issued Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations (SAOR) and during the 

Exit Conference via Zoom on April 23, 2021.  Management comments on the foregoing 

observations were incorporated in this Report, where appropriate. 

 

  

G. Summary of Total Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 
 

The outstanding audit disallowances recognized in the books of accounts 

amounted to P1,927,887.12, of which none was settled/refunded by persons liable. Also, 

there are no outstanding suspensions and charges as at year-end. However, audit 

disallowances amounting to P13,822,175.00 was not yet recognized in the books of 

accounts pending decision on the appeal and motion for reconsideration filed with the 

Director/Commission Proper/Supreme Court. 

 

 

H. Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Recommendations 
 

Of the 21 outstanding prior year’s audit recommendations as at January 1, 2020, 

there were 14 that were reiterated in Part II of this Report. Moreover, there were seven 

(7) audit recommendations that were implemented as of year-end. The implemented 

recommendations are presented in Part III of this Report.
