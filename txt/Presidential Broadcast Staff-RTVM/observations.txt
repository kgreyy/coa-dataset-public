OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

A. Financial and Compliance

Un-uploaded “For Release” coverages

1. Fifty-two coverages that were intended for release to the public were not
uploaded to the agency’s official online platforms, while 14 “For Release”
coverages were either uploaded to only one or two platforms, affecting the
availability to the public timely, accurate, and relevant information on the
activities, programs and pronouncements of the national leadership.

For CY 2020, one of the output indicators of the PBS-RTVM is the number
of presidential events and activities posted in social media.

Review of relevant reports on the activities, engagements and events covered
by the PBS-RTVM involving the Presidency revealed that 52 coverages that were
intended for release were not made available to the public because these were not
uploaded to any of the agency’s three official online platforms i.e. their official
website, YouTube channel, and Facebook page, while 14 “For Release” coverages
were uploaded only to either one or two online platforms.

The table below shows some of the 66 (52+14) “For Release” coverages that
were either not uploaded to any of the Agency’s online platforms or uploaded to
only one or two platforms:

The Management informed that it only abides by the decision of various
Heads of Agencies and officials from the Office of the President – Events
Management Cluster (OP-EMC) who confirm the final classification of
Presidential events, and adheres on the instructions of various units/offices of
government agencies, like the Chief of Presidential Protocol (COPP) and
Presidential Adviser on Foreign Affairs (PAFA) not to release specific events.

It may also be mentioned that, currently, PBS-RTVM has no clear established
guidelines or issuances that govern the agency’s online information dissemination
activities. It merely follows custom and is guided by the practices/protocols already
in place, and is still in the process of documenting all of its coverage process and
drafting its Procedure and Work Instruction Manual (PAWIM).



29

With the noted condition, the public was not adequately informed of the
President’s activities and other events/programs involving the national leadership.
It also deprived the different news outlets of downloading and using the agency’s
video materials for their programs.

We recommended that Management:

a) Direct the web administrators under the MPD to ensure that all
confirmed “For Release” video materials are uploaded to the
Agency’s three official online platforms in accordance with their
customary practice, and pursuant to the agency’s mandate of
making available to the public timely, accurate and relevant
information on the activities, programs and pronouncements of the
national leadership; and

b) Fast track the finalization of the agency’s PAWIM, especially the
guidelines for its coverage activities to ensure that said activities are
done in accordance with the best practices and ISO standards.

Management in its reply to the AOM remarked that:

1) A thorough verification on each event resulted in the following:

39 - Presidential events confirmed “For Release” have been
uploaded in all of PBS-RTVM’s social media platforms

13 - Events confirmed as “Non-PRRD” or Non-Presidential; the
President did not attend the events and/or was represented by a
Cabinet member or other government officials

7 - Presidential events confirmed for “Documentation or
Recording” purposes

5 - Presidential events confirmed “Not For Release” or NFR
1 - Presidential video clip included in the edited news material

uploaded in the RTVM website and YouTube
1 - Presidential event of videotaping confirmed for the People’s

Television Network (PTV) and Presidential Spokesperson
Secretary Harry Roque, Jr.’s production

2) The reference material used in the audit observation did not reflect the
final and confirmed classifications of the Presidential event (For Release,
Not For Release, Non-PRRD or Non-Presidential, Message Taping,
Documentation/Recording, No Documentation or No Video, etc.) since the
document is primarily intended for the video shortlist and video tagging of
all Presidential video file materials stored in the MAMS.

3) The MPD already edited and uploaded the video materials for the 85th
Anniversary of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), Situation

Briefing on the Effects of Typhoon Ulysses in the Cagayan Valley Region
and Interview with the Media in Bicol, in the RTVM website and
YouTube on February 2-3, 2021.

Audit Team’s Rejoinder

The Audit Team will further verify the 39 “For Release” events
that were allegedly uploaded to all the agency’s platforms, the three events
that were uploaded in February 2021, as well as the other events with
other classifications. On the other hand, Management should ensure that
the reports/documents to be provided to the Audit Team shall contain the
final and confirmed classifications of the Presidential events since the
same would be the basis/reference in validating Management’s claim.

Incomplete documentary requirements

2. Twenty-one paid Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) involving the total amount of
P494,813.94 were not duly supported with adequate documentary
requirements prescribed under COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14,
2012, hence, validity and propriety of the transactions could not be ascertained.

Section 4 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 states that “claims against
government funds shall be supported with complete documentation and all laws and
regulations applicable to financial transactions shall be faithfully adhered to.”

While COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribes the
revised guidelines and documentary requirements for common government
transactions. It provides specific documentary requirements for payment of each
type of transactions.

Results of post audit revealed that 21 DVs involving the total amount of
P494,813.94 were not supported with adequate documentary requirements. Fifteen
DVs covering the payments of salaries of Contract of Service (COS)/Job Order (JO)
personnel and consultants hired by the agency for various activities of the RTVM
totaling P340,060.99 were not duly supported with copy of contract and/or Daily
Time Record (DTR). While the DV for the payment of last salary of P10,377.00
lacked the required clearance for money, property and legal accountabilities. On the
other hand, there was no supporting document attached to the 5 DVs for the
payment for various supplies and inventory items in the amount of P133,998.95.

In view of the lacking documents, proper review of the transactions, as to
validity and correctness of the amounts paid, could not be effected.



31

We recommended that Management:

a. require the concerned payees and/or responsible personnel or office
to immediately submit the lacking documentary requirements to the
Audit Team to effect proper review of the transactions; otherwise,
the transactions shall be suspended/disallowed in audit; and

b. henceforth, instruct the Accountant to ensure that the DVs are duly
supported with documentary requirements applicable for each type
of transaction as prescribed under COA Circular no 2012-001, and
refrain from processing claims with incomplete documentation to
avoid suspension/disallowance in audit.

The Management acknowledged and appreciate the audit observation and
informed the Audit Team that the lacking documents were ready for submission.
