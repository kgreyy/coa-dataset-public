EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

A. Introduction

The Presidential Broadcast Staff (PBS), formerly known as the Radio
Television Malacañang (RTVM), was created as a result of the reorganization in
the Office of the Press Secretary (OPS) by virtue of Executive Order (EO) No. 297
dated July 25, 1987. In order to establish proper coordination and to streamline the
functional operations of the different agencies with public relations, public
information and news and information dissemination of the administration and the
presidency, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed EO No. 348 dated August
11, 2001 creating the Office of Communication Director and placing the PBS-
RTVM under the OPS.

By virtue of EO No. 4 dated July 30, 2010 signed by President Benigno S.

Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO), formerly OPS.

As an attached agency of the PCOO, PBS-RTVM is tasked to:

1. Provide audio and video documentation of the President’s activities;

2. Undertake in-house production of broadcast materials and produce such
materials in coordination with other government offices and entities;
and

3. Undertake active coordination with members of the public and private
broadcast section for inter-action between the President and the public.

The PBS-RTVM is headed by Executive Director Dennis Wilfred P. Pabalan,
assisted by four Division Chiefs of Administrative and Finance Division, Research
and Archives Division, Production Division and Engineering Division.

As of year-end, PBS-RTVM had a personnel complement of 125 consisting

CY 2020. It was conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be
placed on the Management’s assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the
propriety of transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws,
rules and regulations; c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and d)
determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.
Moreover, the audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards of

E. Opinion of the auditor on the fairness of presentation of the Financial
Statements

The Auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of presentation
of the financial statements of PBS-RTVM as at December 31, 2020.

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations

The following are the significant audit observations and corresponding
recommendations.

1. Fifty-two coverages that were intended for release to the public were not
uploaded to the agency’s official online platforms, while 14 “For Release”
coverages were either uploaded to only one or two platforms, affecting the
availability to the public timely, accurate, and relevant information on the



iv

activities, programs and pronouncements of the national leadership. (Paragraph
No. 1)

We recommended that Management:

a. Direct the web administrators under the MPD to ensure that all
confirmed “For Release” video materials are uploaded to the Agency’s
three official online platforms in accordance with their customary
practice, and pursuant to the agency’s mandate of making available to
the public timely, accurate and relevant information on the activities,
programs and pronouncements of the national leadership; and

b. Fast track the finalization of the agency’s PAWIM, especially the
guidelines for its coverage activities to ensure that said activities are done
in accordance with the best practices and ISO standards.

2. Twenty-one paid Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) involving the total amount of
P494,813.94 were not duly supported with adequate documentary requirements
prescribed under COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, hence,
validity and propriety of the transactions could not be ascertained. (Paragraph
No. 2)

We recommended that Management:

a. require the concerned payees and/or responsible personnel or office to
immediately submit the lacking documentary requirements to the Audit
Team to effect proper review of the transactions; otherwise, the
transactions shall be suspended/disallowed in audit; and

b. henceforth, instruct the Accountant to ensure that the DVs are duly
supported with documentary requirements applicable for each type of
transaction as prescribed under COA Circular no 2012-001, and refrain
from processing claims with incomplete documentation to avoid
suspension/disallowance in audit.

The above findings and recommendations were discussed with Management
officials concerned. Management views and comments were considered in the
report, where appropriate. The details of the above observations were discussed in
Part II of this report.
