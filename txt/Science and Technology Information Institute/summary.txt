EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

A. Introduction 
 

The Science and Technology Information Institute (STII) was founded in 

January 1987 by virtue of Executive Order No. 128 signed by President Corazon C. 

Aquino. Since then, STII has become the information and marketing arm of the 

Department of Science and Technology (DOST), and a leading repository of science 

and technology information in the country. 

 

STII, through the technical divisions such as the Information Resources and 

Analysis Division (IRAD) and the Communication Resources and Production 

Division (CRPD) with the support of the Finance and Administrative Division 

(FAD), has the responsibility to (a) establish a science and technology databank and 

library; (b) disseminate science and technology information; and (c) undertake 

training on science and technology information. 

 

STII is headed by Director Richard P. Burgos who is assisted by three (3) 

Division Chiefs. For CY 2020, the Institute has a personnel complement of 94, of 

which, 56 are regular employees and 38 are employees under Contact of Service 

hired to assist the three divisions on projects being implemented by the Agency. 

 

B. Operational Highlights 
 

For CY 2020, STII has only one (1) Major Final Output (MFO), Science and 

Technology Information Program, which was concentrated on providing science and 

technology information services to its key stakeholders supporting its Organizational 

Outcome (OO). The Agency’s Accomplishments vis-à-vis Physical targets are 

presented as follows: 

 

OO/MFO/Output Indicator Physical Targets 
Physical 

Accomplishments 
 Variance 

OO: Public Science and Technology awareness increased 

MFO: Science and Technology Information Program 

Output Indicators:    

1. Percentage of clients who rate the library 
services as satisfactory or better 

90% 98% 8% 

2. Number of STARBOOKS sites installed 100 22 -78 

3. Number of promotion services and advocacy 
activities conducted 

1,336 1,045 -291 

 

STII fell short of attaining its physical targets for its MFO for CY 2020 due 

to the restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Travel and physical 

gathering restrictions were implemented; hence, the STII physical library has been 

closed, only few STARBOOKS sites were installed, physical/on-site events were 

limited as well as decline in demand/requests from other agencies for audio-visual 

services. 



ii 

 

In lieu of these, STII has brought its services online through the enhancement 

and development of mobile apps (STARBOOKS mobile app and STARBOOKS 

Quiz App), access to the online portal (www.starbooks.ph) and online library, social 

media postings and virtual events.

transactions as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and

D. Independent Auditor’s Report 
 

A Qualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements of the STII as of 

December 31, 2020 for the material misstatements amounting to P1,517,112.58, 

representing 2.85 percent of the total assets and P832,542.58, representing 2 percent 

of the net assets/equity of the Institute.  

  

E. Summary of Other Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

 The other significant observations and recommendations, discussed in detail 

in Part II of the report, are as follows:   

 

1. Books and unserviceable equipment amounting to P119,794.71 and P76,653.00, 
respectively, were found missing/misplaced, casting doubt on the reliability of the 

submitted CY 2020 RPCPPE and existing controls. 
 

 We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) Complete the physical inventory of all the PPEs, investigate any missing 
property, and present the ‘earlier reported missing but subsequently 

found’ books and ICT equipment amounting to P196,447.71; otherwise, 

hold the persons accountable as liable for the loss; and 

 

b) Report to the Accountant all lost/missing items for the recognition of 
receivables from the persons accountable. 

 

2. Twelve STII employees were provided each with more than one unit of laptop 
computers, 19 units were found defective and unserviceable but unreturned while 

the other units were used by other permanent and contractual employees. 

 

 We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) Require all officers and employees to surrender all unserviceable laptops 
to the GSPS;  

 

b) Require the Property Officer to document/substantiate return of 
unserviceable laptops and transfer of property accountability of some of 

the serviceable laptops; and 

 

c) Determine the condition of the existing property and the extent of 
necessity before purchasing and issuing additional equipment and 

observe prudence in the disbursement of government funds. 



iv 

 

 

3. Equipment purchased through project funds from CY 2012-2019 amounting to 
P16.030 million were still not transferred to the Institute and remained 

unreconciled with the Source Agencies despite completion of projects; thus, 

ownership of and proper accountability for the said properties could not be 

established. Further, these PPEs were not recognized in the fund cluster for trust 

receipts assets inconsistent with Annex M of GAM Volume I. 

 

We reiterated our previous years’ recommendation with modifications and 

Management agreed to require the Property Officer and Accountant to: 

 

a) Ensure completeness of all necessary documents for request of property 
transfer to the agency of all equipment purchased with respect to the 

conditions enumerated under Item I of Section XII DOST A.O. 011; and 

 

b) Henceforth record all the PPE purchased through GIA funds and the 
related accumulated depreciation and recognize as income from donation 

the book value of the PPE upon receipt of documents from the SA/FA 

supporting the transfer of ownership of PPE to the Institute.  

 

4. Payment for professional fees and honoraria to private individuals and/or 
government personnel were not adequately supported with proper documents to 

verify their entitlement, validity and reasonableness of the claims. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 

immediately submit documents that will justify the payment of the above 

professional fees and henceforth, ensure that all payments for contracts are 

supported with adequate documentation as required under COA Circular 

No. 2009-001. 
 

The above findings and recommendations were presented to the concerned 

officials of STII in an exit conference conducted on March 25, 2021. Management’s 

views and comments were considered in the report, where appropriate.
