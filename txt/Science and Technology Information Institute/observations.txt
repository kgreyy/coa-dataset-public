PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
Financial Audit 

 

Accounting Errors and Omissions 

 

1. Various accounts of the Science and Technology Information Institute (STII) 
have material misstatements amounting to P1,517,112.58, representing 2.85 percent 

of the total assets and P832,542.58, representing 2 percent of the net assets/equity of 

the Institute; thus, Management’s assertions as to the accuracy, completeness, and 

classification of the said accounts could not be relied upon. 
 

2. Paragraph 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 
and Section 15 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, provide that 

the financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, 

and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the 

effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 

recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSAS. The 

application of IPSAS, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presented to result in 

financial statements that achieve a fair presentation. 

 

3. Moreover, Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 require 
agencies to keep the accounts in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency 

and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control 

agencies of the government; and that the highest standard of honesty, objectivity and 

consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate 

and misleading information. Each government agency shall record its financial 

transactions and operations conformably with IPSAS and in accordance with pertinent 

laws and regulations. 

 

4. Verification of the journal entry vouchers, disbursement vouchers, liquidation 
reports, inventory and property records of the STII disclosed accounting errors and 

omissions affecting Management’s assertions that all transactions and events: should be 

recorded and have been recorded (Completeness), were recorded without error 

(Accuracy), and in the proper accounts (Classification) as shown in Table 1.

impact under Reporting Phase - Item 4.3, COA Resolution No. 2019-016 dated 25 June 2019, re: "Determining and Using Materiality 

Thresholds in Financial Audit" 

 

a. Unrecorded issuances of small intangible PPEs to end users – P832,542.58 
 

5. Paragraph 44, IPSAS 12, states that when inventories are sold, exchanged, or 
distributed, the carrying amount of those inventories shall be recognized as an expense in 

the period in which related revenue is recognized. If there is no related revenue, the 

expense is recognized when the goods are distributed or the related service is rendered. 

 

6. Section 10, Chapter 8 of GAM Volume I, provides that tangible items below the 
capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 per item shall be accounted as semi-expendable 

property and shall be recognized as expense upon issuance to the end-user. Those which 

were recognized as PPE shall be reclassified to the affected accounts. 

 

7. Further, Section 11 requires issuance of Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) 
(Appendix 59) to end-user of semi-expendable property to establish accountability over 

them, which shall be extinguished upon return of the item to the Property and Supply 

Division/Unit or in case of loss, upon approval of the relief from property accountability. 

 

8. Section 17(g) requires the Property and/or Supply Custodian to prepare the Report 
of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) based on the Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) 

and to be used by the Accounting Division as basis in preparing the JEV to record the 

supplies and material issued. Section 17(1) further provides that ICS are prepared upon 

issue of semi-expendable property covered by approved RIS.  

 

9. In CY 2017, pursuant to GAM guidelines on semi-expendable assets, the STII 
reclassified the small tangible PPEs to Semi-expendable accounts. These semi-

expendable assets had already been issued to end-users; hence, the carrying amount of 

these properties should had been recognized as expense or adjusted to the balance of 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account. However, the related RSMI and RIS were not 

submitted to the Accountant which serves as basis for recording the necessary 

adjustments due to the non-completion of the issuance of the ICS.  



40 

 

 

10. Management then explained that they were unable to complete the issuance of the 
ICS due to difficulty in tracking the end-users and verifying the existence of the 

properties since the renovation of their building had started. Moreover, some of these 

were no longer in the actual custody of the end-users and believed to have been 

misplaced in the renovation site or were already returned without proper documentation. 

 

11. Be that as it may, these properties were initially covered with Property 
Acknowledgement Receipts (PARs) issued to the end-users which established 

accountability over these properties.  This means that despite the probability of loss, the 

accountability of the end-users over these properties remained as they are the signatories 

in the document. Therefore, the PAR could be used as substantial evidence to support the 

preparation and issuance of the ICS to the corresponding end-users.

Other Machinery and Equipment 16,092.54 

Technical and Scientific Equipment 46,560.50 

Total 832,542.58 

 

12. There was no available balance of semi-expendable inventory in the Report of 
Physical Count of Inventory (RPCI) as of December 31, 2020.  Thus, all semi-expendable 

inventories has been issued, be it from a current or a prior year procurement. 

  

13. It is worth mentioning that Management is exerting efforts to comply with our 
recommendation to adjust the issued semi-expendable assets through issuance of ICSs 

with reference to previously issued PARs and was able to issue RISs and RSMIs for the 

related assets amounting to P927,937.12, thus, decreasing the previous year’s balance by 

51 percent. 

 

14. Nevertheless, the non-adjustment of the remaining balances that have been 
outstanding for three (3) years resulted in the overstatement of Semi-expendable accounts 

and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account by P832,542.58. 

 

15. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Property Officer 
to:  

 

a. Expedite the inventory of semi-expendable assets that are subject for 
adjustment and demand end-users to present the PARs previously issued 

to them as basis of the issuance of the ICSs; and 

 



41 

 

b. Complete the issuance of the ICSs and the related RISs for the remaining 
semi-expendable assets and forward the same, together with the RSMIs, 

to the Accountant for recording. 

 

16. The Accountant committed to effect the adjustment for the remaining balance of 
P832,542.58 in the books of accounts in the first quarter of 2021. 

 

b. Misclassification of PPE accounts - P684,570.00 
 

17. Section 42, Chapter 10 of GAM Volume I, requires an entity to conduct a periodic 
physical count of PPE annually and present the results in the Report on the Physical 

Count of Property Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as at December 31 of each year, to be 

submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year with 

disclosure on equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count 

which should be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper 

accounting/recording or adjustment. 

 

18. Comparison between the RPCPPE and the subsidiary ledgers revealed variances 
in the ICT Equipment, Communication Equipment and Printing Equipment accounts due 

to misclassification of the items as recorded by the Accountant in the books, the details of 

which are shown in Table 3.

19. These variances express the absence of reconciliation between the Accounting 
and Property Sections. In effect, the aforementioned misclassifications understated the 

ICT Equipment account by P684,570.00 and overstated the accounts Communication 

Equipment and Office Equipment by P626,580.00 and P57,990.00, respectively. 

 

 



42 

 

20. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant and 
Property Officer to:  

 

a. Regularly reconcile PPE records to prevent variances or if variances may 
exist, effect immediate corrective action/s such as adjustment to any of 

the reports prior to submission to COA; and 

 

b. Prepare the necessary adjustment for the error noted due to 
misclassification of PPEs. 

 

21. Management commented that reconciliation of the RPCPPE and Accounting 
books has been made by the Accountant and the Property Officer as evidenced by the 

same total amount of PPE reflected in the two records. However, as to the classification 

of specific items of PPE, i.e., ICT Equipment, Printing Equipment, Office Equipment, 

etc., they have prioritized the reclassification of the Printing and Communication 

Equipment amounting to P427,290.00 due to time constraints and voluminous items 

(more or less 400 items) for reclassification. Nevertheless, the full reclassification of the 

items under PPE will be reflected in the first quarter of 2021 and will perform regular 

reconciliation and frequent clean-up thereafter to avoid the recurrence of 

misclassification in the future. 

 

22. In summary, the total misstatements amounting to P1,517,112.58, represent 2.85 
percent of the total assets and P832,542.58, representing 2 percent of the net assets/equity 

of the Institute. Due to the significant impact on the financial statements, we rendered a 

Qualified Opinion on the financial statements of the Institute as at year-end. 

  

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

23. Various deficiencies were also noted in recording transactions totaling P3.874 
million, affecting the accuracy, reliability and accountability of the affected FSs accounts 
as at year-end.  
 

a. Recording of payment of prior year’s obligations inconsistent with the accrual 

basis of accounting – P1,568,800.00 
 

24. Paragraph 1 of IPSAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements- which objective 
is to set out overall considerations for the presentation of financial statements prepared 

under the accrual basis of accounting. 

 

25. Section 2, Chapter 2 of GAM, Volume I defines accrual basis as a basis of 
accounting under which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur 

(and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions 

and events are recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the financial 

statements of the periods to which they relate. Xxx. 

 



43 

 

26. Payments to two (2) suppliers, namely, the Social Weather Stations, Inc. (SWS) 
and the Yonzon Associations, Inc. for professional fees obligated in 2019 were treated as 

expense for the current year, as detailed in Table 4.

1,318,800.00 Yonzon 12/5/19 

TOTAL   1,568,800.00    

 

27. As can be gleaned from the above table, the transactions were obligated, had 
transpired and were billed in 2019, hence, should be treated as prior year’s expenses; 

however, these were inadvertently recorded as expenses for the current year in contrast to 

the definition of accrual basis of accounting. As a result, the Other Professional Services 

account for CY 2020 was overstated by P1,568,800.00. 

 

28. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Require the Accountant to, henceforth, recognize expenses when they occur 
or in the period to which they relate, and not only when cash or its 

equivalent is received or paid; and 

 

b. Formulate compensating controls to ensure that all expenses incurred and 
inspected deliveries were adequately supported and immediately forwarded 

to Accounting Unit for the timely accrual/recording of transactions.  

 

29. Management commented that the Accountant observes the Accrual Basis/Method 
of Accounting whereby expenses are recognized in the period when they occur or relates 

to and not when cash is paid.  

 

30. However, for this particular instance, SWS and Yonzon were not included as 
Accounts Payables (Due and Demandable Obligations) in the CY 2019 expenses, but 

were rather treated as expenses in CY 2020. The vouchers were presented for payment on 

January 30, 2020 and February 6, 2020, respectively, resulting in the non-inclusion of 

these items in the books of accounts for CY 2019. 

 

31. To rectify, the Accountant will be making an adjusting entry in the books during 
the first quarter of 2021.  Further, the Accountant committed to ensure implementation of 

preventative and compensating controls in order for similar cases not to recur, i.e., 

coordinating closely with the General Services and Property Section (GSPS) or end-user, 

as the case maybe, to remind them to present to the Accounting Section the unpaid 

vouchers that are due and demandable for proper classification and recording purposes.

b.  Long-outstanding year-end balance of Due from NGAs account – 
P1,264,157.51 

 

32. Volume III of the GAM defines Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) 
as the account used to recognize advances for purchase of goods/services as authorized 

by law, fund transfers to the NGAs for implementation of projects and other receivables 

from NGAs. Credit this account upon receipt of goods/services, and liquidation of fund 

transfers/receivables 

 

33. As at December 31, 2020, the Due from NGAs account had a balance of 
P2,081,390.99, consisting of the unliquidated balance of the Philippine Science High 

School System (PSHSS) and the advance payments to the Procurement Service-

Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) for purchases of goods and services, 

aged from less than 1 to 10 years as shown in Table 5.

Total 2,081,390.99 1,736,558.52 344,832.47 

 

34. Paragraph 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 requires 
that “Within ten days after the end of each month or the end of the agreed period for the 

project, the Implementing Agency (IA) shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) 

and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of funds, after which the 

Source Agency (SA) shall draw a Journal Entry Voucher to take up the reports.” Further, 

Paragraph 4.9 requires the IA to return to the SA any unused balance upon completion of 

the project. 

 

35. The balance of the PSHSS amounting to P217,233.48 pertains to the unutilized 
fund for the project Modernization of STII Library & Upgrading of PSHSS Libraries 

which was completed on September 30, 2010. The PSHSS was able to submit the 

Terminal Financial Report but failed to return the unutilized balance to the STII; instead, 

it directly remitted the said amount to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr). Despite 

persistent follow-ups, no document was provided by the PSHSS to support the said 

remittance, resulting in the non-moving and long outstanding balance for a period of 10 

years. Inquiry with the Audit Team of PSHSS disclosed that due to limited manpower, 

the PSHSS Accountant could not deal with the matter yet as the balance was transacted 

prior to his/her stint.  

 

36. On the other hand, the accumulated balance of the PS-DBM consists of the 
unutilized prepayments due to undelivered items and price variances from 2012 to 2019. 

No additional purchase was made in CY 2020. Comparison between the STII and PS-

DBM reported balances as at December 31, 2020 is shown in Table 6.

37. We sent a confirmation letter to the PS-DBM, however, no response was received 
as of the writing of this report. Alternatively, only the balance in the PS-PhilGEPS 

website was obtained. The amount of P114,614.75 pertains to the eWallet balance of the 

STII in the Virtual Store (VS), while the balance of P600,000.00 was their unexpended 

prepayment for airline tickets under the Government Fares Agreement (GFA).  

 

38. As mentioned in the prior years’ findings and after adjustments, there were 
deliveries in 2017 and 2018 totaling P185,788.12, posted in the PS-DBM ledger but still 

not recorded in the STII books, as shown in Table 7.

Sub-total – 2018 107,739.12 

Grand Total 185,788.12 

 

39. Due to the lack of documents to validate the variances in the reports, the 
unrecorded deliveries are still subject to reconciliation; thus, the reliability of the balance 

from Agency Procurement Requests (APRs) amounting to P1,264,157.51 could not be 

ascertained.  

 

40. Non-reconciliation with the PS-DBM and the PSHSS resulted in long outstanding 
balance of Due from NGAs account in the agency books. 

 



46 

 

41. We reiterated our previous years’ recommendations, with modifications, and 
Management agreed to: 

 

a. Make representations with the PSHSS Management to require its 
Accountant to submit to the STII the appropriate documents to prove or 

support the PSHSS’s direct remittance of the unutilized balance to the 

BTr; otherwise, issue a demand letter to immediately liquidate/refund 

said unutilized balance. 

 

b. Require the Property Officer and Accountant to: 
 

i. Submit a report of all the deliveries from the PS-DBM, particularly 
on APRs in CY 2017-2018, for reference in reconciling the variances 

presented in Table 7; 

 

ii. Ensure that all deliveries are properly supported with Delivery 
Receipts as basis in recording in the books of accounts; and 

 

iii. Ensure that the agency and PS-DBM records are regularly reconciled 
by monitoring the agency purchases in the Virtual Store facility as 

well as delivery of items, and by obtaining a copy of the detailed 

Statement of Account from the PS-DBM to avoid recurring 

observations. 

 

42. Management has been exerting efforts to require the PSHSS in the liquidation of 
the project which was completed in September 30, 2010.  The Institute has been sending 

follow-up letters since 2011, and follow-up phone calls were also already made to the 

PSHSS Main Campus Accountant in 2017 and 2018, but no documents were submitted 

after the said follow-ups. 

 

43. The previous Accountant of the Institute already spoke with the PSHSS 
Accountant during the Assembly of DOST Administrative and Financial Officers 

(ADAFO) last February 23, 2017 regarding reconciliation of the outstanding balance and 

the PSHSS Accountant acknowledged that there is still an unliquidated balance of 

P217,338.48. The unliquidated amount pertains to unutilized project fund which needs to 

be requested with the DBM for refund to the STII. 

 

44. With the recent discussion with the PSHSS Accountant, she committed to give the 
Institute an update on the said liquidation this March 2021 as she will still be 

coordinating with various PSHS Campuses. 

 

45. With regard to the variances noted in 2017 and 2018 on the PS-DBM deliveries, 
all deliveries have already been reconciled, except for those with DR Nos. CSE17-

000008077, CSE17-000009995, CSE17-003486R, CSE17-000017163 and M18-017301. 

An updated reconciled report regarding these DRs will be submitted this April 2021. 



47 

 

Further, GSPS has already sent a letter to the PS-DBM Accounting Division requesting 

reconciliation of records between the Institute and the PS-DBM. 

 

c. Unserviceable assets remained unreconciled and undisposed – P1,040,832.75 
 

46. Section 79 of PD 1445 provides that when a government property becomes 
unserviceable or is no longer needed, it shall be inspected by the head of the agency or 

his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned upon 

application of the officer accountable and if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be 

destroyed in their presence; otherwise, it may be sold thru public auction to the highest 

bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in the 

presence of the auditor concerned or duly authorized representative of the Commission 

on Audit. 

 

47. The Other Assets account with a balance of P1,040,832.75 as at December 31, 
2020, consisted of various unserviceable office and ICT equipment, furniture and 

fixtures, supplies and materials as well as some serviceable but fully depreciated PPEs 

reclassified to the account, pursuant to previous accounting circulars. 

 

48. As previously observed, the Accountant reclassifies unserviceable assets to Other 
Assets account based on previous accounting standards which was, however, nullified 

with the GAM guidelines. No addition to the account was made in CY 2020. 

 

49. As of this report, the Property Officer applied one request for disposal of Printing 
Equipment with a net book value amounting to P221,623.17, which we forwarded to the 

COA Technical Services Office for review of the reappraised value. 

 

50. The remaining assets of P819,209.58 were still unreconciled, thus, protracting 
their final disposition and derecognition in the books of accounts. 

 

51. The prolonged non-disposal of these unserviceable properties deprived the 
government of additional income had these been sold thru public auction at the time that 

these could still command better prices.  

 

52. We reiterated our previous years’ recommendations and Management 
agreed to: 

 

a. Require the Property Officer to intensify efforts to identify those 
unserviceable assets and waste materials stockpiled in the storage area; 

 

b. Prepare the covering Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable 
Property (IIRUP); and 

 

c. Facilitate evaluation of its reasonable value and immediate disposal, 
together with the already identified unserviceable assets, pursuant to 

Section 79 of PD 1445 and Section V of COA Circular No. 89-296.

53. The Property Officer committed to intensify their efforts to identify the 
unserviceable assets and waste materials, religiously update the IIRUP, and facilitate the 

immediate sale and disposal of unserviceable equipment.  

 
Compliance Audit 
 

Missing/misplaced books and unserviceable ICT equipment 

 

54. Books and unserviceable equipment amounting to P119,794.71 and 

P76,653.00, respectively, were found missing/misplaced, thus, casting doubt on the 

reliability of existing controls on property management and the submitted CY 2020 

Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment. 

 

55. Section 42, Chapter 10 of GAM Volume I, requires an entity to conduct a periodic 
physical count of PPE annually and present the result on the Report of the Physical Count 

of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as at December 31 of each year, to be 

submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year, with 

the disclosure on equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical 

count which should be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper 

accounting/recording or adjustment. 

 

56. To validate the existence of some PPEs, we inspected 40 serviceable and 17 
unserviceable properties based on the accounting and property reports. It was revealed 

that four books in the STII Library amounting to P119,794.71 and seven unserviceable 

ICT equipment amounting to P76,653.00 were missing, the details of which are shown in 

Table 8.

57. The Property Officer failed to complete the physical count of the PPEs, but 
nevertheless submitted the CY 2020 RPCPPE before the deadline, thus the said report 

and existing controls over government properties could not be relied upon. 

 

58. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Property Officer 
to: 

 

a. Complete the physical inventory of all the PPEs, investigate any missing 
property, and present the ‘earlier reported missing but subsequently 

found’ books and ICT equipment amounting to P196,447.71; otherwise, 

hold the persons accountable as liable for the loss; and 

 

b. Report to the Accountant all lost/missing items for the recognition of 
receivables from the persons accountable. 

 

59. Management commented that the Property Officer immediately conducted a re-
inventory of the items mentioned above. All of the alleged missing books recorded in the 

RPCPPE have already been found and located, in coordination with the library staff who 

kept the books in a locked cabinet after the inventory last year. Pictures were provided to 

the Audit Team. 

 

60. As for the items under IIRUP, below are the remarks regarding the missing items:

61. The Property Officer committed to issue GAM Form No. 75 for reported lost and 
missing items and to promptly forward the forms to the Accounting Section. 

 

62. The books found were presented to the audit team which has been validated and 
inspected, however, GAM Form No. 75 (Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged or Destroyed 

Property) and other supporting documents have yet to be submitted. 

 

Issuance of multiple laptops to various employees 

 

63. Twelve (12) STII employees were each provided with more than one (1) unit 
of laptop computers, 19 units of which were found defective and unserviceable but 

remained unreturned, while the other units were being used by other permanent 

and contractual employees. 

 

64. Section 77 of PD 1445 requires that when government funds or property are 
transferred from one accountable officer (AO) to another, or from an outgoing officer to 

his successor, it shall be done upon properly itemized invoice and receipt which shall 

invariably support the clearance to be issued to the relieved or outgoing officer, subject to 

regulations of the Commission.  

 

65. Further, Section 101 provides that every officer of any government agency whose 
duties permit or require the possession or custody of government funds or property shall 

be accountable therefor and for the safekeeping thereof and shall be properly bonded in 

conformity with the law. 

 

66. Review of the RPCPPE revealed the issuance of two (2) to eight (8) units of 
laptop computers to 12 STII employees as shown in Table 9. The issued ICT equipment 

were acquired in CY 2004-2020 costing P2,578,239.56.

67. Management explained that the 19 units out of the 48 laptops issued were already 
defective/unserviceable, hence, the need to purchase additional units. However, these 

unserviceable laptops have not yet been returned to the GSPS. It was further explained 

that most of these laptops are being used by the contractual employees to expedite their 

tasks, especially during this pandemic where the Work from Home (WFH) scheme is 

currently implemented. The condition and whereabouts of the laptops as provided by the 

Property Officer is summarized in Table 10:

68. Although we see the need to purchase laptops to expedite tasks under the WFH 
scheme and to replace unserviceable laptops, such accountability was not extinguished 

and remains with the employees whose names are written in the PAR and may constitute 

excessive use of government funds, if not properly accounted for. Once property items 

become unserviceable for any cause or are no longer needed, the accountable officer shall 

immediately return the same to the GSPS. Likewise, those units which are in use by other 

permanent employees shall be transferred accordingly to extinguish accountability of the 

employees concerned. 

 

 



52 

 

69. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Require all officers and employees to surrender all unserviceable laptops 
to the GSPS;  

 

b. Require the Property Officer to document/substantiate the return of 
unserviceable laptops and the transfer of property accountability of some 

of the serviceable laptops; and 

 

c. Determine the condition of the existing property and the extent of 
necessity before purchasing and issuing additional equipment; and 

observe prudence in the disbursement of government funds. 

 

70. A memorandum dated 09 March 2021 was issued requiring all issued laptops and 
tablets to DOST-STII staff to temporarily be returned to GSPS for the reassessment of 

their current state and identification of the unserviceable and still serviceable laptops and 

tablets.  

 

71. All serviceable items will be subject for re-issuance of Property 
Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR), while all unserviceable items will be issued a Property 

Return Slip (PRS). After this activity, the RPCPPE and the IIRUP shall be updated and 

shall serve as the bases for the future procurement of ICT equipment for office use. 

 

Equipment purchased through project funds were still not transferred to the Institute 

despite completion of projects 

 

72. Equipment purchased through project funds from CYs 2012 to 2019 

amounting to P16.030 million were still not transferred to the Institute and 

remained unreconciled with the Source Agencies despite completion of projects; 

thus,  ownership of and proper accountability for the said properties could not be 

established. Further, these PPEs were not recognized in the fund cluster for trust 

receipts assets which is inconsistent with the provision under Annex M of GAM 

Volume I. 

 

73. Item b of Section 17, Chapter 10 of GAM Volume I requires that funds received 
from inter-agency fund transfer shall be recorded in the fund cluster for trust receipts 

assets. Moreover, the implementing agency (IA) shall record and monitor the PPE 

purchased out of inter-agency transferred funds when the PPE meets the recognition 

criteria. At the end of the project, the transfer shall be made in accordance with the 

Memorandum of Agreement/Undertaking (MOA/U), either by donation to the IA or 

return to the source agency (SA). 

 

74. Further, Annex M provides the illustrative accounting entries on the recording of 
PPEs purchased out of inter-agency transferred funds, to wit:

75. Item C of Section XII of DOST Administrative Order (AO) No. 11 dated 
September 2, 2020, or the Revised Guidelines for the Grants-in-Aid Program of the 

DOST and its agencies, likewise, prescribes the recording of equipment purchased out of 

the project funds by the IA in accordance with the provisions set out in the GAM. 

 

76. Moreover, Item I prescribes that upon completion of the project, the Funding 
Agency (FA) may allow the transfer of ownership of an equipment without cost in favor 

of a particular institution/s which implemented the project subject to the conditions 

enumerated under this provision. 

 

77. For CY 2020, STII submitted the RPCPPE for PPE acquired out of GIA funds on 
projects completed in 2012-2019 with a total cost of P16,030,557.96, the details of which 

are in Table 12.

78. As previously noted, STII recorded all equipment purchased through project 
funds in the books of accounts. However, these were eventually derecognized upon 

completion of the project and liquidation of project funds, even though PPE was not 

returned to the Source/Funding Agency. As a result, these PPEs were not recognized in 

the trust fund books contrary to the aforementioned provisions.  

 

79. The Property Officer already sent a letter of request to the FAs to facilitate the 
reconciliation and property transfer of these PPEs. An online inventory with the 

Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology Research and 

Development (PCIEERD) was scheduled for CY 2021. No action was taken yet on the 

accounts of the DOST and the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural 

Resources Research and Development (PCAARRD). 

 

80. Considering that the accountability, custodianship and operation of these 
equipment were placed in the hands of the Institute, it is rightful to execute immediate 

transfer of property to the Institute to avoid any responsibility issue for loss and damage 

that may occur; provided, that the Institute will comply with all the requirements and 

conditions for property transfer. 

 

81. We reiterated our previous years’ recommendations, with modifications, and 
Management agreed to require the Property Officer and the Accountant to: 

 

a. Ensure completeness of all necessary documents for request of property 
transfer to the agency of all equipment purchased with respect to the 

conditions enumerated under Item I of Section XII, DOST AO 011; and 

 

b. Henceforth, record all the PPE purchased through GIA funds and the 
related accumulated depreciation, and recognize as income from 

donation the book value of the PPE upon receipt of documents from the 

SA/FA supporting the transfer of ownership of PPE to the Institute.  

 

82. Management commented that for the year 2020, there was no PPE (Capital 
Outlay) that was acquired through GIA project funds. The P16.031 million capital outlay 



55 

 

was acquired from years 2012 to 2019, all MOAs indicate that ownership of the 

equipment purchased through the respective project funds will remain with the Funding 

Agency until proper transfer/donation has been made. 

 

83. Further, on August 3, 2020, the Property Officer sent letters of request to transfer 
the equipment purchased under GIA projects to the PCIEERD, PCAARRD, and DOST-

CO. As of this report, however, only the PCIEERD has responded. DOST-STII and 

PCIEERD have conducted an online inventory of equipment and are in the process of 

requesting the transfer of these equipment to the STII. 

 

Inadequate supporting documents 

 

84. Payment for professional fees and honoraria to private individuals and/or 
government personnel were not adequately supported with proper documents to 

verify their entitlement, validity and reasonableness of the claims. 

 

85. Item 6, Section 4 of PD 1445 states that “Claims against government funds shall 
be supported with complete documentation.” 

 

86. Section 3.1.2 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 listed the 
documents required to be submitted along with the contract, from the Invitation to Apply 

for Eligibility and to Bid up to the Notice to Proceed, including such other documents 

peculiar to the contract and/or to the mode of procurement and those considered 

necessary in the auditorial review and in the technical evaluation thereof. 

 

87. We observed that some contracts relative to the payment of professional fees were 

inadequately supported with the necessary documents to verify the qualification of the 

service providers, the validity and reasonableness of the claims, as shown in the details 

provided in Table 13.

88. The absence of and deficiencies on the aforementioned documents cast doubt on 
the entitlement of the individuals and the validity of the professional fees paid to them.  

  

89. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
immediately submit documents that will justify the payment of the above 

professional fees and henceforth, ensure that all payments for contracts are

found to be reasonable per audit team’s evaluation. 

  

91. However, it must be emphasized that henceforth all disbursements or payments 
for contracts should always be supported with complete documents to facilitate 

verification of validity and reasonableness of the claims. 

 

Other Mandatory Issues 

 
Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

92. The Institute expended P6.765 million or 7.14 percent of its total budget of 
P94.736 million for the implementation of GAD activities, exceeding the 5 percent 

requirement, pursuant to Section 31 of the General Provisions of RA 11465, 

otherwise known as the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of 2020. 

 

93. Section 31, General Provisions of the 2020 GAA or RA 11465 requires, among 
others, agencies to allocate at least five percent (5%) of their budgets for activities which 

relate to GAD. The preparation and submission of the annual GAD Plan and Budget 



57 

 

(GPB) and annual GAD Accomplishment Report shall be subject to the guidelines issued 

by the agencies concerned. 

 

94. For CY 2020, the Institute prepared GPB for the 10 gender issues identified 
involving client-focused and organization-focused issues with allocated funds totaling 

P7,135,380.00, which was 7.53 percent of the Institute’s P94,736,154.00 total annual 

appropriations. Verification of the fund utilizations in the submitted accomplishment 

report showed that of the P7,135,380.00 total allocations, P6,765,556.66 or 95 percent 

was expended/utilized for GAD-related activities.  

 

95. Only 15.96 percent of the expenses were direct expenditures of GAD activities 
while the remaining 84.04 percent was derived from the attributed costs of the regular 

programs/projects/activities (PPAs) of the Institute to GAD as a result of the Program 

Implementation and Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (PIMME) checklist of 

the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) as prescribed in the 

PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Memorandum Circular No. 2012-01, with the details as shown 

below:

 Total 6,765,556.66  

 

96. It bears noting that despite the current pandemic restrictions, the Institute was able 
to integrate gender-perspectives in its regular/flagship programs. Thus, we continuously 

encouraged the implementation of GAD-focused programs, projects and activities to 

address gender issues. 

 

97. We recommended and Management agreed to continue the integration and 
mainstreaming of GAD projects and activities in its operations with a budget of at 

least 5 percent of its total appropriations to address gender issues and gender 

responsive governance in compliance with the provisions of the GAA. 

 

Senior Citizens and Differently-abled Persons 

 

98. The Institute failed to formulate plans, programs, and projects intended to 
address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, pursuant to 

Section 32 of the General Provisions of the 2020 GAA. 

 

99. Section 32 of the General Provisions of the 2020 GAA or RA 11465 directs all 
agencies of the government to formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address 

the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their 



58 

 

mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.  Moreover, all 

government infrastructures and facilities shall provide architectural or structural features, 

designs, of facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of 

persons with disability, pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA 7227. 

 

100. In CY 2020, the Institute planned two (2) activities for senior citizens and PWDs: 
(a) Seminar on Basic Photography for Individuals with Hearing and Speech Impairment, 

and (b) Seminar on Making Elderlies Prepared during a Pandemic, which were scheduled 

on the 3rd and 4th quarters of the year. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic 

restrictions, such activities were not implemented. 

 

101. Nevertheless, a ramp had been provided in front of the STII Building’s main 
entrance to facilitate the mobility of senior citizens and PWDs who might be visiting the 

Institute’s offices, and a comfort room designed for PWDs had also been provided at the 

ground floor for their convenience.  The building has no elevator since it has only two (2) 

floors but its library rooms and STARBOOKS corner are located at the ground floor for 

easy access of interested senior citizens and PWDs. 

 

102. We recommended and Management agreed to implement these planned 
activities intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with 

disability for the ensuing year, or implement activities that are feasible in this time 

of a pandemic.  

 

Youth Development 

 

103. Management has been providing support to youth development activities as 
advocated in the GAA by accepting students from different colleges and universities to 

undergo on-the-job training necessary for the completion of their academic requirements. 

However, during this pandemic, no OJTs were accepted. It is still worth noting that 

webinars conducted by the Institute during the year were mostly participated in by 

students. 

 

Compliance with Hiring of Job Orders and Contractuals  

 

104. To implement its programs/activities for CY 2020, the Institute hired a total of 38 
contractual/Job Order employees representing an additional workforce of 68 percent to 

the 56 regular plantilla employees in order to provide administrative and technical 

assistance. Of these, 32 employees were paid against the General Fund and 6 employees 

against the Project Funds. The Institute paid the services of the contractuals/job orders 

totaling P10,040,132.16, of which P8,798,235.13 were charged against the Maintenance 

and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) of the General Fund and P1,241,897.03 against 

the Project Funds.
