PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

Accounting Errors and Omissions 

 

1. The Cash and Cash Equivalents, Inventories, Property, Plant and Equipment 
(PPE) and Liabilities accounts totaling ₱20,724,161.89, which represents 0.23 

percent of its total Expenses of ₱8,895,179,121.49 as at December 31, 2020 and 

is lower than the established materiality threshold of ₱44,475,895.61 or one half 

percent of the total Expenses balance for an expense-driven entity, hence 

without material impact on the fair presentation of the financial statements 

(FSs) of the OWWA.  

 

1.1. Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 
National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, states that “Fair 

presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of 

transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance the definitions and 

recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in 

PPSAS.1” 

 

1.2. Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 read as follows: 
 

Section 111. Keeping of accounts. 

 

1. The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is 
necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be 

adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control 

agencies of the government. 

 

2. The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency 
shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against 

inaccurate or misleading information. 

 

Section 112. Recording of financial transaction. Each government 

agency shall record its financial transactions and operations 

conformably with generally accepted accounting principles and in 

accordance with pertinent laws and regulations. 

 

1.3. Audit of various accounts of the OWWA as at December 31, 2020 disclosed 
total uncorrected misstatements/errors of ₱20,724,161.89, summarized in the 

matrix in the succeeding pages:

1.4.1. Section 56, Chapter 19 and Sections 2(j) and 3, Chapter 21 of the 
GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides the following: 

 

Chapter 19 – Financial Reporting 

 

Sec. 56. Adjustments for Unreleased Commercial 

Checks. A Schedule of Unreleased Commercial Checks 

shall be prepared by the Cashier for submission to the 

Accounting Division/Unit. All unreleased checks at the 

end of the year shall be reverted back to the cash 

accounts. A Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) shall be 

prepared to recognize the restoration of the cash 

equivalent to the unreleased checks and the recognition 

of the appropriate liability/payable account. The 

accounting entry for the restoration of the unreleased 

check to the cash account shall be a debit to “CIB-

LCCA” account with credit to the appropriate liability 

account. There shall be no physical cancellation of the 

checks. The JEV supporting such restoration shall form 

part of the supporting document to the financial 

statements to be submitted to COA at year-end. At the 

start of the ensuing year, another JEV shall be drawn to 

reverse the previous entry made and recognize the 

availability of the checks for release. 

 

Chapter 21 – Bank Reconciliation  

 

Sec. 2(j). Outstanding Checks - checks the 

agency/entity has issued and recognized but which have 

not been presented to the bank for payment. 

 

Sec. 3. Objectives. The Bank Reconciliation 

Statement (BRS) shall be prepared in order to: 



42 

 

a. check correctness of both the bank’s and 

agency’s/entity’s records, 

b. serve as a deterrent to fraud, and 

c. enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges 

or credits recognized by the bank or agency/entity but 

not yet known to the agency/entity or bank. 

 

This shall be used in the reconciliation of bank and 

treasury accounts maintained with Government 

Servicing Bank (GSB). 

 

1.4.2. While Section 97 of PD No. 1445 provides that a treasury warrant 
or check which remains outstanding after two years from the date 

of issuance shall not be paid by the Treasurer of the Philippines or 

by any duly authorized depository. The issuing agency shall take 

up in its books of accounts the amount of this warrant or check as 

surplus adjustment of the fund against which it was previously 

charged. Upon presentation of a stale warrant or check, the issuing 

agency shall cancel it and issue to the payee a substitute warrant or 

check in lieu thereof. 

 

1.4.3. Review of submitted BRS in OWWA-CO showed that included in 
the reconciling items are Prior Year’s (PY’s) deposits/credit 

memos/deposits from unknown depositors totaling ₱6,640,201.43, 

which are not yet recorded in the books, thereby understating the 

Cash account by the same amount. 

 

1.4.4. In RWO-NCR, examination of the account balance of the CIB-
LCCA and CIB-LCSA per books in comparison with the balances 

per bank confirmation disclosed that the CIB-LCCA and CIB-

LCSA accounts of the RWO-NCR were overstated by ₱59,078.04, 

and ₱0.30, respectively, due to erroneous recording of 

disbursements and posting of amount deposited for the payment. 

 

1.4.5. In RWO-I, the regular funds sourced from the GAA totaling 
₱7,546,968.75 received for MOOE and other programs of the 

RWO-I were deposited in the CIB-LCCA but were recorded in the 

books as Cash-Treasury/ Agency Deposit, Regular, contrary to 

COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020, which states 

that the latter account should be used only for collections remitted 

to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr). 

 

1.4.6. In RWO-X, verification of the CIB account revealed that there 
were outstanding checks totaling ₱1,446,083.41, which have been 

stale from 6 to 96 months. Some checks were dated as early as 

2012. It was noted that some stale checks are in fact unclaimed 



43 

 

checks. While in RWO-XIII, review and analysis of the CIB-

LCCA for General Fund (GF) disclosed the existence of stale 

checks presented as outstanding checks in the Bank Reconciliation 

Statement (BRS) as of December 31, 2020 totaling ₱545,517.43. 

The non-cancellation of these checks affected the accuracy of the 

reported CIB accounts and the related liability accounts. 

 

1.4.7. Lastly, review of the BRS of RWO-XIII for GF and GAA- 
MOOE/NRCO fund as of December 31, 2020 revealed that 

reconciling items for both funds totaling ₱1,596,090.30 were 

unreleased checks as of yearend but were tagged as outstanding 

checks in the BRS. 

 

1.4.8. We recommended that Management require the Accountants 
of the CO, NCR, RWOs I, X and XIII to prepare adjusting 

entries to correct the balance of the Cash and other related 

account as at yearend. 
 

1.4.9. Management commented the following: 
 

Office Management’s Comments 

OWWA-

CO 

The Accounting Division (AD) relayed that they will 

reconcile their records and will make the necessary 

adjusting entries for the unrecorded deposits and credit 

memos. They have also sent demand letter to the AO to 

submit the documents as basis for the recording of the 

deposits in which to no avail so far. 

NCR Management acknowledged the recommendations and the 

Accounting Unit (AU) informed that the reconciling items 

were recorded already on March 31, 2021. 

RWO I Management explained that the Cash-Treasury/ Agency 

Account was used because it was instructed by OWWA-

CO. However, they will coordinate with the OWWA-CO 

regarding the audit recommendation and they committed 

to comply with the said recommendation. 

RWO X Management commented that they will require the 

designated Accountant to review the long 

outstanding/stale checks and will require canceling those 

unclaimed checks and preparing the JEV to record the 

cancellation.  

RWO 

XIII 

On unadjusted stale checks, Management stated that they 

will adhere to the recommendation of the COA Audit 

Team (AT) and ensure to strictly observe the guidelines 

for issuance of replacement checks. At present, the 

Accountant-Designate is already in the course of 

preparing the adjusting entry for the cancellation of the 

stale checks to reflect the correct balances of CIB and 

Liability accounts. 

 



44 

 

Office Management’s Comments 

On unadjusted unreleased checks, Management informed 

that the designated Cashier is already aware of the audit 

recommendation and will faithfully comply to prepare the 

Schedule of Unreleased Checks on a monthly and annual 

basis to be submitted to the AD. Further, the Accountant 

will also ensure that necessary entries will be made at 

yearend. 

 

B. Inventories Accounts 

 

Misstatement in the Inventories accounts of ₱887,206.18 

 

1.5. The balance of Inventories accounts as of December 31, 2020 is misstated in 
the amount of ₱887,206.18, due to the following:

1.5.1. Section 10(b), Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, 
provides that semi-expendable property shall be recognized as 

expense upon issue to the end-user. 

 

1.5.2. In RWO IV-B, inquiry with the Acting Property Officer disclosed 
that the semi-expendable assets totaling ₱325,324.00 were already 

issued to end-users. However, the Agency is still in the process of 

preparing the Inventory Custodian Slips (ICSs), hence the 

Accountant has no basis in dropping the same in the books, thus 

overstating the Inventories accounts. While in RWO-XI, issued 

semi-expendable properties totaling ₱653,839.40 were still 

included as part of the Inventories accounts of the Agency as at 

December 31, 2020 due to lack of reconciliation of records 

between the Accountant and the Supply Officer. 

 



45 

 

1.5.3. In RWO-VII, verification of the General Ledgers (GLs) shows that 
there were credit entries in the amounts of ₱78,045.22 and 

₱13,912.00 for the Office Supplies Inventory; and Medical, Dental 

and Laboratory Supplies Inventory, respectively, or a total of 

₱91,957.22 representing the difference of the physical count of 

inventory and the corresponding balances per books, which were 

not supported with a Report of Supplies and Materials Issued 

(RSMI), thereby affecting the fairness of the presentation of the 

financial statements. 

 

1.5.4. We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the 
Accountant of the following RWOs to: 

 

RWO IV-B and XI  

 

a. prepare the adjusting entries to correct the net 
overstatement of Inventories account; and  

 

RWO VII  

 

b. add back the credited Office Supplies and Medical and 
Dental Supplies Inventories. Deduction thereof must only 

be made once the Supply Officer submits the required 

RSMIs. 

 

C. PPE Accounts 

 

Misstatement in the PPE accounts of ₱899,577.81 

 

1.6. The balance of PPE accounts as of December 31, 2020 is misstated in the 
amount of ₱899,577.81, due to the following:

(837,478.39) 

Total  (899,577.81)   

 



46 

 

1.6.1. Section 27(c), Chapter 10 of the same Manual provides that 
“Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such 

as when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be 

capable of operating in the manner intended by management. For 

simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, depreciation 

shall be for one month if the PPE is available for use on or 

before the 15th of the month. However, if the PPE is available for 

use after the 15th of the month, depreciation shall be for the 

succeeding month.” (Emphasis supplied) 

 

1.6.2. Also, Section 27(l), Chapter 10 of the same Manual states that 
“Depreciation shall be recognized as a debit to the “Depreciation 

Expense” account and a credit to the “Accumulated 

Depreciation” account. Accumulated Depreciation is a contra-

asset account presented in the FS as deduction from the related 

asset account.” (Emphasis supplied) 

 

1.6.3. Moreover, Section 10, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I 
provides that tangible items below the capitalization threshold of 

₱15,000.00 shall be accounted as semi-expendable property. 

 

1.6.4. While COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 
describes Other PPE as the account used to recognize the cost of 

acquisition or fair value, if acquired through donation or transfers 

without cost, of other property, plant and equipment not falling 

under any of the specific Property, Plant and Equipment 

account. (Emphasis supplied) 

 

1.6.5. In RWO-NCR, the Audit Team recomputed the recorded amount 
of accumulated depreciation and depreciation expenses as of CY 

2020 of the PPE accounts and revealed that the Accumulated 

Depreciation should have been ₱5,065,760.02 instead of 

₱5,127,859.45, a difference of ₱62,099.42, while the Depreciation 

Expense was overstated by ₱61,244.42, hence resulted in an 

overstatement of the Accumulated Depreciation, thereby, affecting 

the carrying cost of the PPE items. Likewise, the overstatement of 

both the Depreciation Expenses and Accumulated Depreciation 

and understatement of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) misstated the 

accounts as at yearend. 

 

1.6.6. In RWO-IV-A, the PPE account was misstated by ₱837,478.39 due 
to the inclusion of semi-expendable items below the capitalization 

threshold of ₱15,000.00. 

  



47 

 

1.6.7. We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the 
Accountant of the following RWOs to: 

 

NCR 

 

a. make the necessary adjustments in the books of accounts to 
correct the noted deficiencies;  

 

RWO IV-A 

 

b. reclassify the semi-expendable properties which were 
previously recorded as PPE falling below the capitalization 

threshold of ₱15,000.00. 

 

D. Liabilities Accounts 

 

Misstatement in the Liabilities accounts of ₱8,768,653.67 

 

1.7. The balance of Liabilities accounts as of December 31, 2020 is misstated in 
the amount of ₱8,768,653.67, due to the following:

1.7.1. Executive Order (EO) No. 87 dated August 13, 2019 directed that 
all accounts payable which remain outstanding for two years or 

more in the books of national government agencies be reverted to 

the accumulated surplus or deficit of the GF, or the cumulative 

result of operations of the national government. 

 

1.7.2. Moreover, Section 13 of COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated 
January 8, 2020 provides the definition and normal balances of the 

following Accounts:

This account is credited to recognize the receipt of

1.7.3. The balance of Accounts Payables-Others totaling ₱5,759,692.89 
was outstanding for more than two years, contrary to EO No. 87, 

as follows: 

 

Office

1.7.4. Lastly, it was disclosed in the 2009 Notes to FS of OWWA that the 
following are held in trust by the OWWA for the expenses 

incurred in the implementation of the Joint Program on HIV and 

AIDS on Migrations:

1.7.5. Since the above funds are held in trust, it should be properly 
classified as Trust Liabilities instead of Due to Other Funds as 

prescribed in COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020. 

 

1.7.6. We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the 
Accountant of the following Offices to: 

 

CO, RWOs VI and X 

 

a. revert to Accumulated Surplus the Accounts Payables 
totaling ₱5,759,692.89, which have been outstanding for 

more than two years pursuant to EO No. 87 dated August 

13, 2019; 
  



49 

 

CO 

 

b. analyze the account based on available documents and 
determine the nature of the Due to Other Funds – UNICEF 

and UNDP amounting to ₱3,008,960.78 and prepare the 

necessary adjusting entry to correct the misclassification. 
 

Other Accounting Deficiencies 

 

2. Various deficiencies were noted in the Cash and Cash Equivalents, Receivables, 
Other Assets, Inventories, PPE, and Liabilities Accounts totaling 

₱677,012,711.55, thus affected the reliability, accuracy, completeness and 

valuation of the said accounts. 

 

2.1. Section 6, Chapter 19, GAM for NGAs, Volume I enumerates the qualitative 
characteristics of financial reporting. Among which, are timeliness, 

reliability, faithful representation and completeness, defined as follows: 

 

 Timeliness – the usefulness of financial statements is impaired if they 
are not made available to users within a reasonable period after the 

reporting date. Ongoing factors such as complexity of an entity’s 

operations are not sufficient reasons for failing to report a timely basis. 

More specific deadlines are dealt with by legislation and regulations in 

many jurisdictions. 

 

 Reliability – reliable information is free from material error and bias, 
and can be depended on by the users to represent faithfully that which it 

purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. 

 

 Faithful representation – information to represent faithfully 
transactions and other events, it should be presented in accordance with 

the substance of the transactions and other events, and not merely their 

legal form. 

 

 Completeness – the information in financial statements should be 
complete within the bounds of materiality and cost. 

 

2.2. In the audit of the accounts and transactions of the OWWA for CY 2020, 
deficiencies in the recording and reporting of financial transactions were 

noted that affected the reliability, accuracy, completeness and valuation of 

the reported balances of accounts in the FSs. These have resulted due to the 

absence of documents that support carry-over balances, non-compliance by 

the Management with some of the provisions and requirements of the GAM 

for NGAs, lack of reconciliation between the records of Accounting and 

Property Units and non-preparation and non-submission of some of the 

required reports on time.

* The amount forms part of the amount on Dormant Loans Receivable shown in this 

Table, hence not stated in the column Amount Involved in order not to overstate the 

deficiencies in the Receivables account 

 

2.4. The details on the deficiencies summarized in Table No. 7 are discussed, as 
follows: 

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

 

 Deficiencies noted in the preparation/submission of BRS 
 

2.4.1. Sections 4 and 7, Chapter 21, GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states: 
 

Sec. 4. Method of Bank Reconciliation. The monthly 

BRS shall be prepared by the Chief Accountant/designated 

staff for each of the bank accounts maintained by the 

agency/entity using the Adjusted Balance Method. Under 

this method, the book balance and the bank balance are 

brought to an adjusted ash balance that must appear on the 

Statement of Financial Position. 

 

Sec. 7. Reporting. The Chief Accountant shall submit the 

BRS within twenty days after receipt of the monthly BS to 

the following: 

 

Original – COA Auditor (with all the supporting 

documents and JEVs) 

Copy 2 – Head of Agency/Entity 

Copy 3 – Accounting Division/Unit file 



53 

 

Copy 4 – Bank, if necessary 

 

2.4.2. In OWWA-CO, review of the submitted BRS of four bank 
accounts with a balance of ₱176,941,776.28 as of December 31, 

2020 shows that the outstanding checks amounting to 

₱1,917,709.43 were not deducted in the balance per bank, resulting 

in the overstatement of the Cash account. Said overstatement was 

already adjusted by the Accountant, however, the revised BRS was 

not yet submitted. 

 

2.4.3. Moreover, in RWO V, of the six bank accounts, five bank accounts 
with a balance of ₱61,742,613.48 as of December 31, 2020 have 

no updated BRS, and the latest BRS on file at the Audit Team’s 

Office was as of May 31, 2019 only.  

 

2.4.4. While in RWO VIII, it was observed that the Agency uses the 
Bank to Book reconciliation method instead of the requisite 

Adjusted Balance method. It was noted that these five BRSs with a 

balance of ₱20,836,671.18 as of December 31, 2020 were not duly 

supported with the required Bank Statements and supporting 

documents, hence verification of the same by the Audit Team 

could not be carried out promptly. Furthermore, the Audit Team, in 

the verification of the BRS, noted that there was also a lump 

amount of ₱1,350.00 added to the bank balance and tagged as 

“Erroneous Charging by the bank”, with no details or transaction 

reference, hence doubtful as to existence, propriety and validity. It 

was gathered that this amount pertained to prior years and found to 

be a reconciling item in the beginning of January 2020 BRS. 

 

2.4.5. We recommended that Management require the respective 
RWO Accountant to: 

 

CO and RWO VIII 

 

a. prepare and submit the BRS in accordance with the 
provisions of Chapters 19 and 21 of GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I; and 

 

RWO V 

 

b. strictly observe the timeline on the submission of BRSs, in 
compliance with the provisions of Chapter 21 of GAM for 

NGAs, Volume I. 

  



54 

 

2.4.6. The Management commented as follows: 
 

Office Management Comment 

RWO 

V 

The Accountant admitted that the available Bank 

Statements are up to May 2019 only and due to the ECQ 

last year, as much as the Office wants to request the 

snapshots from the bank, the same cannot be done 

because of the restrictions at that time.  

RWO 

VIII 

The Accountant relayed that the unadjusted balance is a 

bank reconciling item. Moreover, the Accountant 

committed to retrieve the PY files to facilitate proper 

adjusting entries. Likewise, the Accountant agreed to 

use the Adjusted Balance Method of bank reconciliation 

beginning CY 2021. 
 

2.4.7. The Audit Team of RWO V rejoined that the Accountant should 
prepare monthly BRS for the months of June 2019 until updated 

because the beginning balance depends upon the adjusted balance 

of the previous month. 
 

 Undocumented adjustments in Cash account 
 

2.4.8. In RWO NCR, review of the BRS revealed that the adjustment 
amounting to ₱56,979.50 recorded in the CIB-LCCA - 

MMG/OGER were not duly supported with an inter-office debit 

memorandum as it pertains to funds transferred to RWO IV-B on 

December 18, 2017 and/or a letter of demand issued to RWO IV-B 

for the return of the erroneously transmitted funds. It was noted 

that the said transfer should have been recorded as Due from ROs 

– RWO IV-B. 
 

2.4.9. Moreover, in RWO V, the JEVs and its supporting documents 
pertaining to the adjustments to the CIB accounts were not 

submitted to the AT. 
 

2.4.10. We recommended that Management require the Accountant of 
NCR and RWO V to submit the lacking documents required 

and that identified reconciling items should be immediately 

documented, properly disclosed, and taken up in the books in 

accordance with aforementioned rules and regulations to 

prevent their accumulation. 
 

 

 

 

 



55 

 

 Non-preparation/maintenance of SLs as prescribed by the GAM for 
NGAs, Volume II 

 

2.4.11. Appendix 6, Volume II of the GAM provides the instructions to be 
followed by the Accountant on the maintenance of the SLs, as 

follows: 
 

This ledger shows detail for each control account in the 

GL which is maintained per account and fund cluster by 

the Accounting Division/Unit. 
 

2.4.12. At the end of each month, after all transactions in the journals have 
been posted, the debit and credit columns of each account shall be 

footed in pencil and the balance indicated in ink. The totals of the 

SL balances shall be reconciled with the corresponding GL 

controlling account. 
 

2.4.13. The SL provide the detailed individual balances making up the GL 
total. They provide substantial audit support for the GL and 

provide further breakdowns of financial statement totals where 

desired. At the end of the posting period, the balance of the 

controlling account should equal the total of the balances of the 

accounts in the SLs. 
 

2.4.14. In RWO I, audit revealed that SL for the CIB-LCCA-Operations 
Fund account for the RWO, consisting of various OWWA program 

funds maintained by the Accountant were not in the required 

format provided in the GAM, thus, the details of the CIB-LCCA 

balance of ₱43,229,217.91 cannot be determined. 
 

2.4.15. While in RWO V, it was noted that the Office has two Collecting 
Officers, one based at OWWA RWO V, Legazpi City while the 

other is based at OWWA Satellite Office at Naga City, Camarines 

Sur, however, no SL was maintained for each of the Cash 

Collecting Officer account with year-end balance of ₱26,855.59 to 

provide for the necessary details of their collections and deposits 

and the balances that should have been reconciled with the totals of 

the GL. 
 

2.4.16. We recommended and the RWOs agreed to: 
 

RWO I 

 

a. ensure compliance by the RWO I with RA No. 10801 and 
Appendix 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II by 

instructing the Accountant to maintain SL for the CIB- 

LCCA Operations Fund in the required format provided 



56 

 

for under the GAM to properly monitor the receipt, 

utilization, and balances of the OWWA program funds; 

and 

 

RWO V 

 

b. require the Accountant to prepare and properly maintain 
SLs to support the GL totals for the various accounts in the 

Statement of Financial Position (SFPo) pursuant to Section 

6(e), Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 
 

Receivables 

 

2.4.17. The applicable laws, rules and regulations concerning Receivables 
are as follows: 

 

2.4.18. Section 2 of the State Audit Code of the Philippines (PD No. 1445) 
provides that “It is the declared policy of the State that all 

resources of the government shall be managed (xxx), with a view to 

ensuring government. The responsibility to take care that such 

policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head 

of the government agency concerned.” 

 

2.4.19. COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 prescribes 
the guidelines and procedures in reconciling and cleaning the 

books of NGAs, Local Government Units, and Government-

Owned and/or -Controlled Corporations with dormant receivable 

accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers for the 

fair presentation of accounts in the financial statements. Moreover 

Section 6.1 and 7.1 thereof provide as follows:  

 

Section 6.1 All government entities shall conduct regular 

monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts to ensure 

that these are collected when these become due and 

demandable and that cash advances and fund transfers are 

liquidated within the prescribed period depending upon 

their nature and purpose. 

 

Section 7.1 Conduct regular and periodic verification, 

analysis, and validation of the existence of the 

receivables, unliquidated cash advances, and fund 

transfers, and determine the concerned debtors, 

accountable officers (Regular and Special Disbursing 

Officers, Collecting Officers, Cashiers) and the source 

and implementing government entities concerned. 

 



57 

 

2.4.20. On the other hand, Appendix 5, Volume II of the GAM provides 
the instructions to be followed by the Accountant on the 

maintenance of the GL, as follows: 

 

This ledger summarizes all transactions recorded in the 

GJ and special journal (e.g. CRJ, CDJ, CkDJ, etc.) 

maintained in the Accounting Division/ Unit. The ledger 

sheet is arranged in the same order or sequence of the 

accounts appearing in the RCA. Postings to this ledger 

shall come directly from the General and Special 

Journals. 

 

xxx 

 

At the end of the fiscal year, each account shall be ruled 

and closed. All totals shall be written legibly in ink and 

the balance of the real account carried forward as the 

opening balance of the new GL for the next fiscal year. 

 

 Unreconciled Variance between the records of OWWA and the 
NGAs 

 

2.4.21. The AT of OWWA-CO sent confirmation letters to DOLE and ILS 
and the Accountants of the said agency responded that the 

following amounts were already recorded as deduction in their 

liability to OWWA, however, these were not yet recorded in the 

books of OWWA-CO. Details are as follows: 

 

Implementing Agency 

Recorded Liquidations in the 

SLs of Implementing 

Agencies 
(In PhP) 

DOLE 5,206,669.70* 

ILS 495,378.94 

Total 5,702,048.64 
*Liquidations are based on the generated eNGAS SL of Due to Other GOCCs of DOLE from 

Jan. 2007 – Dec. 2015 only. For CYs 2007 below, the DOLE has no available records. 

 

2.4.22. We recommended that Management require the Accountant of 
CO to reconcile the Due from NGAs and prepare the necessary 

adjusting entry for error/s noted and liquidations in the books 

of the OWWA and NGAs. 
 

2.4.23. Management commented that the journal entries for liquidation of 
ILS will be prepared once their liquidation is submitted. 

Reconciliation for the balances of the DOLE is still ongoing and 

will be adjusted accordingly. 

  



58 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

2.4.24. The Audit Team of OWWA-CO will monitor the compliance by 
the Management. 

 

 Doubtful accuracy of SL entries 
 

2.4.25. In RWO-CAR, a collection was made on September 2, 2020, under 
Official Receipt (OR) No. 15617968 in the amount of ₱178,677.83 

for the payment of an Enterprise Development and Loan 

Program/Livelihood Development Program for OFWs 

(EDLP/LDPO) Loan. The whole amount was credited to the 

Receivable account but the SL of the concerned borrower showed 

a balance of only ₱75,048.80. This resulted in an understatement 

of the Loans Receivable account by ₱103,629.03. 

 

2.4.26. We recommended that Management require the Accountant of 
RWO-CAR to adjust the Loans Receivable account by 

₱103,629.03 for the collection received from an OFW 

borrower. 

 

2.4.27. The Management commented that adjustments were already 

included in the January 2021 General Journal (GL) and there was 

an ongoing inventory of SL accounts and updating of SL. 

 

 Unreconciled aging schedules and re-assessment for allowance for 
impairment was not yet made 

 

2.4.28. In RWO VI, the Loans Receivable from various programs of the 
Agency totaled ₱23,517,080.88 as of December 31, 2020. Of this 

amount, ₱8,534,222.43 pertains to special financial loan assistance 

for OFWs affected by closures of Saudi Arabia-based companies, 

Mohamad Al Mojil (MMG) and Saudi Oger Ltd. (SOL), while the 

remaining amount consists of long outstanding loans from prior 

years’ (PYs’) programs and/or projects. Loans granted during the 

year amounted to ₱71,960.18, composed of loans through the 

MMG and SOL assistance programs. 

 

2.4.29. Review of the Aging Schedule to support these receivables, 
however, showed a total of only ₱21,786,325.34, or ₱1,730,755.54 

less than the book balance.  

 

2.4.30. Inquiry with the previous and current Accountants disclosed that 
this difference pertained to long outstanding receivables. Sufficient 

documentation to determine the details of the accounts are still 

being gathered prior to inclusion in the aging of receivables. 



59 

 

Difficulty in locating these source documents, and the 

prioritization of current year’s COVID-19 response programs 

prevented the timely reconciliation of these accounts. 

 

2.4.31. Further review of the Aging Schedule of Loans Receivable 
disclosed that the amount of ₱13,252,102.91 represent loans 

granted through PYs’ programs/projects of the Agency, which 

remained outstanding for over three years. 

 

2.4.32. On the other hand, the allowance for the above PYs’ receivables 
remained unadjusted at ₱10,208,833.46 as of December 31, 2020, 

or a difference of ₱3,043,269.45. 

 

2.4.33. We recommended, and Management of RWO VI agreed, to: 
 

a. ensure the reconciliation of the balances between the 
aging schedules of all receivables and the recorded 

amounts in the books of accounts; 

 

b. review objective evidence as to risk of loss due to 
uncollectability of receivables as basis for assessment of 

allowance for impairment; and 

 

c. regularly monitor the receivables of the Agency and 
hasten the collection thereof, to avoid the accounts from 

becoming past due. 

 

 Non-preparation/maintenance of updated SLs resulting in disparity 
of balances between the GL and subsidiary records 

 

2.4.34. In RWO CAR, analysis of the Loans Receivable account with a 
balance of ₱18,784,948.72 disclosed discrepancies between the GL 

and SL totaling ₱1,552,123.08, which were the result of not 

updating the SLs whenever there were collections. It was further 

noted that the data presented to the Audit Team was the only 

record the RWO Accountant could provide, thus the reliability and 

validity of the Loans Receivable Account for CY 2020 could not 

be determined due to absence of SLs/records to provide details and 

to support the GL account. 

 

2.4.35. In RWO V, verification revealed that the recorded Loans 
Receivable-Regular balance in the SFPo as of December 31, 2020 

was ₱3,640,439.95 while the Schedules of the Loans Receivable –

Regular showed a total of ₱3,632,563.99, or a difference of 

₱7,875.96. The inconsistencies in the figures could be attributed to 

the absence of SLs for said accounts, thus the reliability and 



60 

 

accuracy of the reported Loans Receivable-Regular as at year-end 

could not be ascertained.  

 

2.4.36. We recommended that Management require the concerned 
RWO Accountants to fast-track the reconciliation of GL and 

SL and effect necessary adjustments to reflect the correct 

balance of the Loans Receivable account. 

 

2.4.37. The Management of RWO CAR commented that adjustments were 
already included in the January 2020 General Journal, and also 

relayed that the AU is currently in the process of updating the said 

SLs. 

 

Cash Advances 

 

 Unreconciled SL and GL balances of cash advances 
 

2.4.38. In RWO V, verification revealed that the totals in the Schedules of 
the Advances to Officers and Employees and Advances to Special 

Disbursing Officers (SDOs) did not tally with the amounts 

recorded in the GL and as reported in the FS, showing a difference 

of ₱165,366.12 and ₱131,536.32, respectively, as shown below: 

 

Account 
Balance per 

GL/FS

Advances to Officers and

Total 1,124,896.80 1,091,067.00 33,829.80 

 

2.4.39. Moreover, the liquidations of the cash advances for both accounts 
have been overdue ranging from two months to more than one 

year, contrary to the above-cited regulations. Cash advances for 

local travel, seminars and other activities should be liquidated 

within 30 or 60 days after the activity has been completed 

depending on the purpose of the cash advance. It was also noted 

that a cash advance was granted to a Job Order employee, which is 

contrary to the regulations that only permanently appointed 

employees shall be designated as Disbursing Officers. 

  



61 

 

2.4.40. We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the 
RWO V Accountant to: 

 

a. issue demand letters to the concerned officers and 
employees to immediately liquidate their long overdue cash 

advances; 

 

b. conduct reconciliation of the SL balances, if available, with 
the GL totals to have reliable balances of the accounts to be 

reported in the financial statements; 

 

c. maintain properly SL for the Advances to Officers and 
Employees and Advances to Special Disbursing Officers 

accounts; and 

 

d. henceforth, refrain from granting cash advances to a Job 
Order employee. 

 

Inventories 

 

2.4.41. The applicable laws, rules and regulations concerning Inventories 
are as follows: 

 

Section 63 of PD No. 1445 provides that except as may otherwise 

be specifically provided by law or competent authority all moneys 

and property officially received by a public officer in any capacity 

or upon any occasion must be accounted for as government funds 

and government property. Government property shall be taken up 

in the books of the agency concerned at acquisition cost or an 

appraised value. 

 

Section 9, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states that: 

“the supplies and materials purchased for inventory purpose shall 

be recorded using the perpetual inventory system. The system 

requires accounting records to show the amount of inventory on 

hand at all times through the maintenance of the Supplies Ledger 

Cards (SLC) (Appendix 57) by the Accounting Division/Unit and 

Stock Cards (SC) (Appendix 58) by the Supply and/or Property 

Division/Unit for each item in stock. Regular purchase shall be 

coursed through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be 

recorded as they take place except for supplies and materials 

purchased out of Petty Cash Fund (PCF) for immediate use or on 

emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the 

appropriate expense accounts.” 

 



62 

 

2.4.42. Also, in the Instructions for RSMI (Appendix 64), Volume II of 
the GAM, the following are to be done by the Supply and 

Accounting Unit: 

 

a. The RSMI is a form prepared by the Supply and/or 
Property Division/Unit to report/summarize all issues 

of inventories (by stock number) during the day. 

 

xxx 

 

c. At the end of the month, all RSMIs shall be 
consolidated by the Accounting Division/Unit for the 

preparation of the JEV. 
 

2.4.43. Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides: 
 

Sec. 11. Accountability over Semi-expendable Property. 

Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) (Appendix 59) shall be 

issued to end-user of Semi-expendable Property to establish 

accountability over them. Accountability shall be 

extinguished upon return of the item to the Property and 

Supply Division/Unit or in case of loss, upon approval of 

the relief from property accountability. 

 

xxx 
 

Sec. 13. Inventory Accounting System. xxx. Physical 

count/inventory, which is required semi-annually, is an 

indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of 

property custodianship. 

 

xxx 

 

Sec. 17. Records, Forms and Reports to be prepared 

and/or maintained. The following records, forms and 

reports are prescribed for use: 

 

b. Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) – shall be used to 
record all receipts and issues of supplies and the 

balance in quantity at any time. It shall be 

maintained by the Property and/or Supply 

Division/Unit for each item in stock. The IAR, RIS, 

PO and DR serve as the original sources of 

information for making entries on the card. 

 

c. Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) (Appendix 57) – 
shall be used to record materials received, issued and 



63 

 

the balance both in quantity and amount at any time. 

It shall be maintained by the Accounting 

Division/Unit for each kind of supplies and 

materials. The IAR, RIS, RSMI, PO and DR serve as 

the original sources of information for making 

entries on the card. 

 

xxx 

 

i. Report on the Physical Count of Inventories 
(RPCI) (Appendix 66) – shall be used to report the 

physical count of supplies by type of inventory as at 

a given date. It shows the balance of inventory items 

per card and per count and shortage/overage, if any. 

These include the semi-expendable property wherein 

the issue is covered by ICS. 

 

xxx 

 

l. Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) (Appendix 59) – 
shall be prepared upon issue of semi-expendable 

property covered by approved RIS. 

 

2.4.44. Section 4, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides, 
among others, that the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 

represents the minimum cost of an individual asset recognized as a 

PPE on the SFPo. 

 

2.4.45. Likewise, Appendix 66 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II states that 
the RPCI shall be submitted to the COA Auditor concerned not 

later than July 31 and January 31 of each year for the first and 

second semesters, respectively. 

 

2.4.46. The details of the deficiencies are as follows:  
 

 Not updated Stock Cards (SCs), SLCs and Inventory Custodian 
Slips (ICSs) and non-inclusion of semi-expendable property as part 

of Inventory 

 

2.4.47. Audit in OWWA CO disclosed that the RPCI and SCs of Office 
Supplies Inventory account revealed that the quantity per SC 

column presented in the RPCI is different from the quantity per SC 

of Office Supplies. This implies that either or both of the RPCI and 

SCs are not updated. There might also be a possible unaccounted 

inventory item. Thus, the accuracy of the balance of the 



64 

 

Inventories account as of December 31, 2020 totaling 

₱16,822,636.63 could not be established. 

 

2.4.48. Likewise, in RWO CAR, analysis revealed that the AU and the 
Supply Unit do not maintain the SLCs and SCs, respectively. The 

RSMI was submitted to the AU only in December 2020, thus the 

issuance of inventory for the year was recorded only in that period. 

This precluded the Agency from counterchecking and tracking the 

movement of its supplies. Further, the submitted RPCI as of 

December 31, 2020 was not a complete report because it did not 

include the Semi-expendable items.  

 

2.4.49. We recommended that Management require: 
 

a. the Procurement and Property Management Division 
(PPMD) and AD to update regularly the SCs, SLCs and 

ICSs in accordance with Section 17, Chapter 8 of GAM for 

NGAs, Volume I; and  

 

b. RWO CAR to maintain its SLCs and SCs.  
 

2.4.50. The Management commented as follows: 
 

Office Management Comment 

OWWA-

CO 

Management informed that they will comply with 

the regular updating of the SCs and ICSs and 

coordinate with the AD in order to comply with the 

rules prescribed under Section 17, Chapter 9 of 

GAM for NGAs. 

RWO 

CAR 

Management stated that they submitted on March 1, 

2021, a complete RPCI as of December 31, 2020; 

SLCs as of December 31, 2020, on February 2, 

2021; ICSs as of December 31, 2020; and RSMI as 

of February 2, 2021. 

 

2.4.51. The Auditors’ Rejoinder: 
 

Office Management Comment 

OWWA-

CO 

Management action is duly noted. The AT will 

monitor the compliance of Management on the 

recommendation. 

RWO 

CAR 

The AT was not presented with the SLCs for the 

inventories. The AT still had to verify if the cost 

presented in the issuance of supplies were from the 

SLCs. 

 



65 

 

Office Management Comment 

Also, the AT was not informed of the inventory 

count. A COA representative should be present as a 

witness in the inventory of property, including the 

semi-expendable property. 
 

 Office Supplies not recorded under Perpetual Inventory Method 
 

2.4.52. In RWO I, verification revealed that the RWO used the Expense 
method of recording purchases of office supplies instead of the 

Perpetual Inventory Method as required in Section 9, Chapter 8, of 

the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. Purchases during the year totaling 

₱1,163,739.06 were recorded by direct debit to Office Supplies 

Expense instead of Office Supplies Inventory account.  
 

2.4.53. Further, SLC and SC were maintained thru a database by the 
Accountant and Supply Officer, respectively, to record the receipts 

and issuances of inventories. However, the books of accounts do 

not reflect the actual movement of inventories because the office 

supplies were recorded immediately as expense. 

 

2.4.54. This practice resulted in lack of accounting control over the 
inventories and unreliable balance of the Office Supplies Inventory 

and related expense account in the FSs. 
 

2.4.55. We recommended and Management agreed to ensure 
compliance with Section 9, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I, by directing the Accountant to adopt the Perpetual 

Inventory System in accounting of office supplies by recording 

regular purchases to the Office Supplies Inventory account and 

debiting Office Supplies Expenses upon issue. 
 

 Unreconciled RPCI and book balances 
 

2.4.56. In RWO VIII, analysis disclosed that Office Supplies Inventory 
year-end balance of ₱198,963.19 represents unissued office 

supplies under the GAA Fund only, since those under the OWWA 

Fund were all issued to end-users as of yearend. However, said 

amount could not be relied upon due to understatement of 

₱4,293.22 resulting from non-reconciliation with the RPCI as of 

December 31, 2020 and inaccuracies with other reports affecting 

the account, as provided below:

2.4.57. Review of the GLs on Office Supplies Inventory and related 
Expense account disclosed that during the current year, the Agency 

issued office supplies to end-users in the total amount of 

₱208,314.14, as follows:

Balance as of Dec. 31, 2020 198,963.19 - 198,963.19 

 

2.4.58. It was noted that the amount of ₱208,314.14 representing issued 
office supplies to end-users was recognized totally in JEV No. 

2020-12-199 dated December 31, 2020. It has been the practice of 

the Agency to record issued supplies, as well as to submit all RISs 

and RSMIs to the Audit Team, only once annually, at yearend, 

contrary to Appendix 64 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II, which 

requires monthly preparation of JEV for RSMIs. 

 

2.4.59. We recommended, and Management agreed, to: 
 

a. direct the Supply Officer and Accountant to reconcile the 
Office Supplies Inventory book balance as against physical 

count, and the latter to make the appropriate adjusting 

journal entries; and 

 

b. require the Supply Officer-Designate to prepare RISs and 
RSMIs, and for the Accountant to recognize office supplies 

expenses on a monthly basis. Also, JEVs drawn to 

recognize issuances must always reconcile and be 

supported with the necessary documentation upon 

submission to the AT.  

  



67 

 

Property, Plant and Equipment(PPE) 

 

2.4.60. The applicable laws, rules and regulations concerning PPE are as 
follows: 

 

Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides 

that “The entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which 

shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the 

Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as at 

December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor 

concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. 

Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the 

physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit 

for proper accounting/ recording.” 

 

Section 42, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides 

that “The Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each 

category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. 

The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, 

description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, 

impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. 

For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall 

likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the 

receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be 

reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting 

Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property 

records like PAR.” 

 

Instructions for RPCPPE (Appendix 73) of GAM for NGAs, 

Volume II, states that the RPCPPE shall be certified correct by the 

Inventory Committee Chair and Members, approved by the Head 

of Agency/Entity or his/her Authorized Representative, and 

verified by the COA Representative. 

 

COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 provides the 

guidelines and procedures in the conduct of physical count of PPE 

and states, among others: 

 

5.6 Each government agency shall adopt a uniform 

property identification system for PPE wherein a 

unique Property Number shall be assigned for each 

PPE item, using the following numbering system: 

0000 – 00 – 00 – 0000 – 00 (Year purchased/ PPE 

sub-major account group/ GL Account/ Serial 

Number (one series per PPE category/type/location)/ 

Location or Office)  



68 

 

 

The codes for the PPE sub-major account group and 

GL account correspond to those provided in the 

Revised Chart of Accounts prescribed under the 

Accounting Manuals of the respective Sectors 

(National, Local and Corporate).  

 

5.7  For easy identification, the Property Number shall be 

prominently shown in the property sticker, in 

addition to the following vital information on the 

PPE item: (a) Description of the property; (b) Model 

Number; (c) Serial Number; (d) Acquisition 

Date/Cost; (e) Person Accountable; and (f) Space for 

the validation/signature of the Inventory Committee  

 

6.2.5 All PPE items counted shall be tagged with new 

property stickers containing the information 

provided under Paragraph 5.7 of this Circular. 

 

2.4.61. Further, the IPSASs provide the standards for the proper 
presentation and valuation of accounts in the financial statements. 

IPSAS 1 - –Presentation of Financial Statements states that “FSs 

shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, 

and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful 

representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and 

conditions in accordance with the definitions and other events, and 

recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses 

set out in IPSASs.”  

 

2.4.62. Paragraph 3.26 of the Conceptual Framework of IPSAS provides 
that verifiability is the quality of information that helps assure 

users that information in the financial statements faithfully 

represents economic and other phenomena that it purports to 

represent. Supportability is sometimes used to describe this quality 

when applied in respect of explanatory information and 

prospective financial and non-financial quantitative information 

disclosed in the financial statements – that is, verifiability.  

 

 Not updated Property Cards (PCs) and Property, Plant and 
Equipment Ledger Card (PPELCs) 

 

2.4.63. In OWWA CO, the PCs and PPELCs were not updated as of 
December 31, 2020. Query with the PPMD personnel revealed that 

they are in the process of updating the preparation of PCs of the 

PPE items procured in CY 2020. The PPMD personnel also 

disclosed that the delay in updating the PCs was due to 



69 

 

identification and classification of the procured items as PPEs or 

Semi-expendable Equipment. Furthermore, alternative work 

arrangement and frequent lockdowns resulted in the lack of 

personnel and workforce. Similarly, the PPELCs prepared by the 

AD is not updated as the personnel assigned tested positive for 

COVID-19 and unfortunately died due to the said disease, thus two 

required documents could not be reconciled for audit purposes.  

 

2.4.64. Table below shows the 2020 procurements that are in the process 
of preparation of PCs and PPELCs:

2.4.65. We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the 
PPMD and AD to update regularly the PCs and PPELCs, in 

compliance with Section 42, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I. 

 

 Laxity in the preparation/maintenance of lapsing schedule for PPE 
  

2.4.66. Lapsing schedule is a spreadsheet that lists the purchase date, 
depreciation, and other accounting actions such as additional 

acquisitions and disposition related to a fixed asset. The intent of 

the schedule is to show the rate at which the book value of a fixed 

asset declines over time.  

 



70 

 

2.4.67. In RWO NCR, the Audit Team (AT) requested the submission of 
lapsing schedule as reference in audit, however, the Accounting 

Unit failed to provide the schedule. 

 

2.4.68. We recommended, and Management of RWO NCR, agreed to 
direct the Accounting Unit to maintain a lapsing schedule for 

all PPE items to facilitate the computation of Depreciation 

Expenses. 

 

 Unreconciled RPCPPE and book balances 
 

2.4.69. Review of submitted reports of the RWO IV-B revealed a net 
variance of ₱274,359.62 in the cost of PPE in the books of 

accounts and the RPCPPE, as shown below: 

 

Accounts  

COST 

Per Book Per RPCPPE Variance 

(In PhP) 

Office Equipment 476,620.00  234,130.00  242,490.00  

Furniture and Fixtures 388,344.00  826,837.48  (438,493.48) 

IT Equipment and 

Software 1,270,820.00  1,352,150.00   (81,330.00) 

Other Machinery and 

Equipment 76,503.00  90,303.00   (13,800.00) 

Motor Vehicles 1,775,000.00  1,775,000.00  - 

Other PPE 19,499.75  - 19,499.75  

Other Assets 26,261.86  28,987.75   (2,725.89) 

Total/Net Variance 4,033,048.61  4,307,408.23   (274,359.62) 

 

2.4.70. The failure of the Accountant and the Inventory Committee to 
conduct reconciliation of their respective reports which resulted in 

a net variance of ₱274,359.62 and the inclusion of PPE items that 

do not meet the capitalization threshold in the RPCPPE cast doubt 

on the accuracy, completeness and existence of the reported PPEs 

in the Agency books. 

 

2.4.71. We recommended that the Accountant and the Inventory 
Committee of RWO IV-B coordinate with each other to 

reconcile their respective reports to ensure correctness and 

reliability of the amounts stated therein. 

 

 Misclassified PPE Accounts 
 

2.4.72. Computer sets and printers totaling ₱1,106,250.00 in RWO-VII 
were classified as Other PPEs, thus affecting the fair presentation 

of the accounts. 

 



71 

 

2.4.73. We recommended that Management require the Accountant of 
RWO VII to reclassify the Other PPE items totaling 

₱1,106,250.00 as PPE-ICT Equipment. 

 

 Failure to issue Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) 
 

2.4.74. Further, verification of reports in RWO IV-B revealed that the 
reported PPEs were already issued to the accountable officers 

(AOs), however, PARs were not issued. According to the Acting 

Property Officer, PARs were already prepared but were not yet 

signed by the AOs, hence accountabilities over the properties are 

not properly established. 

 

2.4.75. We recommended, and Management agreed, to issue PARs to 
AOs to conform to the provisions of GAM for NGAs, Volume 

I, and COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020. 

 

Liabilities 

 

2.4.76. The applicable laws, rules and regulations concerning Payables are 
as follows: 

 

Sections 4(6) and (7) of PD No. 1445 state that “Claims against 

government funds shall be supported with complete 

documentation” and “All laws and regulations applicable to 

financial transactions shall be faithfully adhered to.” 

 

Sections 59 and 98 of PD No. 1445 also reiterate the above 

provisions regarding the Accounts Payable, for easy reference, 

quoted herein: 

 

Section 59. Audit of liabilities. In his audit of 

liabilities, the auditor shall seek to establish that all 

obligations of the agency have been accurately 

recorded; only bonafide obligations of the agency 

have been included; the obligations incurred are 

properly authorized; all provisions of trust indentures 

or mortgages are complied with; and mortgages and 

other encumbrances are fully disclosed. 

 

Section 98. Reversion of unliquidated balances of 

accounts payable. The Commission, upon notice to 

the head of agency concerned, may revert to the 

unappropriated surplus of the general fund of the 

national government, any unliquidated balance of 

accounts payable in the books of the national 



72 

 

government, which has been outstanding for two 

years or more and against which no actual claim, 

administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is 

not covered by perfected contracts on record. This 

section shall not apply to unliquidated balances of 

accounts payable in trust funds as long as the 

purposes for which the funds were created have not 

been accomplished. 

 

Section 37, Chapter 2 of the GAM, Volume I, provides, among 

others, that “No obligation shall be certified to accounts payable 

unless the obligation is founded on a valid claim that is properly 

supported by sufficient evidence and unless there is proper 

authority for its incurrence. Any certification for a non-existent or 

fictitious obligation and/or creditor shall be considered void. The 

certifying official shall be dismissed from the service, without 

prejudice to criminal prosecution under the provisions of the 

Revised Penal Code. Any payment made under such certification 

shall be illegal and every official authorizing or making such 

payment, or taking part therein or receiving such payment, shall be 

jointly and severally liable to the government for the full amount 

so paid or received.” 

 

2.4.77. COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 5, 1997 provides the 
guidelines on the proper disposition/closure of dormant funds 

and/or accounts of NGAs and failure of the officials/employees 

concerned to comply thereof shall subject them to administrative 

disciplinary action in accordance with the provisions of Section 

122 (2), Chapter 3, Title III, PD No. 1445 and Section 55, Chapter 

10, Sub-title I-B, Book V of EO No. 292, series of 1987, or the 

Revised Administrative Code of the Philippines. 

 

2.4.78. Section 13, Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that 
the books of accounts shall be maintained by fund cluster as 

follows: 

 

Code Agency 

01  Regular Agency Fund 

02  Foreign Assisted Projects Fund 

03  Special Account-Locally Funded/Domestic Grants Fund 

04 Special Account-Foreign Assisted/Foreign Grants Fund 

05 Internally Generated Funds 

06 Business Related Funds 

07 Trust Receipts 

 



73 

 

2.4.79. In addition, Appendix 5 of the GAM, Volume II, provides the 
instructions to be followed by the Accountant on the maintenance 

of the GL, as follows: 

 

This ledger summarizes all transactions recorded in 

the GJ and special journal (e.g. CRJ, CDJ, CkDJ, etc.) 

maintained in the Accounting Division/Unit. The 

ledger sheet is arranged in the same order or sequence 

of the accounts appearing in the RCA. Postings to this 

ledger shall come directly from the General and 

Special Journals. 

 

At the end of the fiscal year, each account shall be 

ruled and closed. All totals shall be written legibly in 

ink and the balance of the real account carried 

forward as the opening balance of the new GL for the 

next fiscal year. 

 

 Existence of negative balances 
 

2.4.80. In OWWA-CO, analysis revealed that the details of Due to Other 
Funds-PFI Loan and Due to Other Funds-AIG Insurance totaling 

₱3,739,708.16 showed an inclusion of negative balances totaling 

₱601,578.97, as follows:

*Secretariat Fund and Dollar Fund are both maintained for the Internally Generated 

Fund of OWWA 

 

2.4.81. The negative balance of the Due to Other Funds – AIG Insurance 
is presented since 2016 in the detailed SFPo of Secretariat Fund, 

while the Due to Other Funds – PFI Loan became negative in CY 

2018 from a positive balance of ₱988,343.39 as of December 31, 

2017. 

 

2.4.82. While in RWO III, evaluation of the Accounts Payable account 
disclosed the abnormal/negative balance on its books, which 

pertains to Intra-Agency Payables-Welfare Fund Contribution 

(WFC) totaling (₱9,992,048.04). 



74 

 

 

2.4.83. The above negative balances of Liabilities accounts affected the 
fair presentation of the FS. 

 

2.4.84. We recommended that Management instruct the Chief 
Accountant to review and analyze the transactions 

surrounding the incurrence of the negative balances of 

Liabilities accounts so that appropriate adjustments can be 

made in the books to eliminate the abnormal balances. 

 

 Disbursements not supported with complete documentation 
 

2.4.85. In OWWA CO, audit revealed that there were no documents to 
support OWWA’s indebtedness and supporting list of creditors 

with the nature of the liabilities to facilitate the review and analysis 

of the individual account. 

 

2.4.86. As provided in COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020, 
the Due to Other Funds should only be used if there is a transfer 

from other funds and/or payables to other funds that is within the 

fund clusters maintained by the OWWA-CO. However, as shown 

in the details of Intra-Agency Payables, it includes those that are 

explicitly not coming from Funds maintained by OWWA, as 

follows: 

 

Account 
Amount 

(In PhP) 

Due to Other Funds - PFI Premium 1,008,834.90  

Due to Other Funds - PFI Loan (237,759.40)

Association (WEA) 
672,940.22  

Due to Other Funds - AIG Insurance 3,977,467.56  

Due to Other Funds - UNICEF 1,374,635.68  

Due to Other Funds - UNDP 1,634,325.10  

Due to Other Funds - Microsoft 2,138,265.71  

Due to Other Fund - Medicare 13,686,906.77  

Total 24,255,616.54 

 

2.4.87. In RWO CAR, review of OFW-Dependent’s Scholarship Program 
(DSP) payments in December 2020 totaling ₱570,000.00 revealed 

that the Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) were not supported with 

the required documentation, particularly the Medical 

Certificate/Clearance from Department of Health (DOH) 

accredited hospital/clinic/center for initial claim as required in the 

Manual on the Implementation of Scholarship Programs for the 

OFW-DSP issued under OWWA MOI No. 012, Series of 2019, 



75 

 

thereby indicating lapses in internal control over the Agency’s 

disbursements. 

 

2.4.88. While in RWO III, it was noted that due to non-submission of the 
Schedule of Accounts Payable (SAP) (Appendix 54 of the GAM 

for NGAs, Volume II), the actual aging of Accounts Payable could 

not be determined. Valid claims could not be established due to 

absence of valid documents showing proof of actual claims such as 

perfected contract or valid obligation. 

 

2.4.89. Also in RWO VI, analysis of the Accounts Payable as of 
December 31, 2020 disclosed that ₱145,300.00 remained 

outstanding for more than two years. Interview with the Agency 

Accountant disclosed that the amount was not released to the 

beneficiaries of the Skills for Employment Scholarship Program 

(SESP) due to incomplete documentary requirements. 

 

2.4.90. Moreover, disbursements totaling ₱48,003,694.38 were 
unsubstantiated by sufficient documentation. 

 

2.4.91. We recommended that Management require the Chief 
Accountant to determine the nature of the Due to Other Funds 

totaling ₱24,255,616.54 and prepare adjusting entry to record 

it in its appropriate Liabilities account and the concerned 

RWO officials to direct the Accounting Unit of RWOs CAR, 

III and VI to provide supporting documents pertaining to the 

payables of the Agency to substantiate the claim. 

 

2.4.92. The Management commented as follows: 
 

Office Management Comment 

RWO 

CAR 

Management reasoned that the submission of the 

medical certificate as required in the Memorandum 

of Instruction (MOI), was not complied with 

because of the pandemic. But they agreed with the 

recommendation that in the succeeding payments, 

all requirements will be attached to the DVs. 

RWO 

VI 

During the Exit Conference, Management presented 

the original DVs and supporting documents of 

several transactions subject of the audit observations,

2.4.95. In NCR, review of the Loans Receivable account revealed that a 
total of  ₱76,620,218.40 remained outstanding for a period of more 

than three to 12 years. 

 

2.4.96. While, in RWO CAR, out of the ₱18,957,418.80 loans receivable 
as of December 31, 2020, only 1.17 percent or ₱222,470.08 were 

collected and the amount of ₱10,358,499.79 remained unsettled 

and outstanding in the books for ten years or more with a remote 

possibility of collection. Further, no collections were received from 

SFLAP since the time that the loans were granted in 2018. 

 

2.4.97. In RWO IV-B, analysis disclosed that the very minimal collection 
of loans receivable was due to lack of pertinent information/data 

necessary like addresses in sending collection/demand letters to the 

debtor-beneficiaries, while some of the debtors assumed that the 

loans were dole-outs from the government. 



79 

 

 

2.4.98. Meanwhile, in RWO V, evaluation disclosed that the RWO failed 
to submit the required supporting documents to the request for 

write-off of the Loans Receivable - FELSF.  

 

2.4.99. In RWO VI, it was noted that the total amount of ₱14,982,858.55 
pertained to Loans Receivable balances which are non-moving and 

without collections for more than two to 10 years. Upon inquiry, 

the Accountant explained that collection efforts were hampered 

due to lack of personnel, which was exacerbated because of the 

COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the Accountant echoed sentiments 

of Management as to the collectability of these accounts. 

 

2.4.100. In RWO XIII, verification disclosed that Loans Receivable 
accounts as presented in the SFPo showed a total balance of 

₱13,333,134.99. Of this amount, a total of ₱11,595,620.10 is past 

due accounts which represents receivables arising from loans 

released to member-OFW borrowers under OFW Groceria Project 

and FELSF, which have been dormant for 10 to 13 years. 

 

2.4.101. We recommended that the Management require the concerned 
RWOs to: 

 

a. intensify the collection of the Loans Receivable by 
employing an efficient collection mechanism and regular 

monitoring of the loan accounts; 

 

b. exert more effort to locate the OFW debtors and 
coordinate with other government agencies like the 

Commission on Elections to trace the whereabouts of the 

OFWs;  

 

c. coordinate with the OWWA CO as to the status of action 
by their Legal Office for loans granted and for assistance 

from the DFA on the status of cases pending in the 

Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Tribunal and the collection of 

Special Financial Loan Assistance Program (SFLAP) 

Loans as stated in the MOI; 

 

d. require the Accountant to make a detailed assessment of 
the possible collectability/settlement of the Loans 

Receivable account pursuant to Sections 6.1 and 7.1 of 

COA Circular No. 2016-005; and 

 

e. expedite the evaluation and reconciliation of all overdue 
accounts to determine the proper disposition and request 



80 

 

authority to write-off, if warranted, pursuant to the 

provisions of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 

19, 2016. 

 

2.4.102. The Management commented as follows: 
 

Office Management Comment 

RWO 

IV-B 

Management stated that they have already initiated 

actions regarding long overdue loans because the 

accumulation of dormant receivables is not only the 

concern of RWO IV-B but is actually the problem of 

all RWOs. 

RWOV The Office informed that they will comply with the 

audit recommendations and will coordinate with the 

previously in-charge personnel of the loans. 

RWO 

VI 

During the Exit Conference, Management explained 

that efforts had been exerted to collect the receivables 

and the willingness of the recipients to pay but 

considering the penalties and interests, which tripled 

the value of the payable amounts, debtors had 

communicated their inability to pay off their loans. 

 

Further, Management informed that OWWA, in the 

past, had already created Task Force SIYASAT, for 

the collection of loans especially those covered with 

land titles as loan collateral. Accordingly, initial steps 

had already been undertaken by the task force for the 

foreclosure of loan collaterals and with the land titles 

submitted to the CO. However, such initiative had 

ceased and the planned application of the collateral to 

loans did not materialize.  

 

Finally, Management committed that analysis and 

assessment of dormant receivables be made during the 

Second Semester of CY 2021. 

RWO 

XIII 

Agreed to comply with the recommendation. 

 

2.4.103. The Auditor of RWO V responded that they will monitor the 
compliance with the recommendations, while the AT of RWO VI 

suggested to follow up the status of the collaterals for the loans 

submitted to the CO as well as the application and/or foreclosure 

of these collaterals. Moreover, Management may revisit the 

mentioned interests and penalties applied to the subject loan 

balances and develop the corresponding Agency Action Plan.

 Dormant Receivables Accounts 
 

2.4.104. Analysis of the Receivables account of OWWA CO as of 
December 31, 2020 disclosed that the following are non-moving 

for at least three years, as follows:

Due from NGAs 116,615,612.61 1,989,622.69 83,125,989.92 

 

2.4.105. The Interests Receivable are accrued interests recognized on 
investments such as T-bills and Debentures Bonds. The last 

transaction for this account was in CY 2013 where it decreased 

from ₱2,627,790.00 to ₱2,325,214.00, however, no subsequent 

transactions were recorded thereafter. 

 

2.4.106. Due from Government Corporations – NLSF are loan programs for 
OFWs. The NLSF is now merged with the Livelihood Corporation 

pursuant to EO No. 681 and known as the National Livelihood 

Development Corporation (NLDC). Review of the Notes to FS of 

OWWA reveals that this account remained unchanged since CY 

2017. 

 

2.4.107. The Due from NGAs account of ₱83,125,989.92 was noted to be 
dormant for over 10 years. 

 

2.4.108. Though the accounts aged three years and above may not yet be 
considered as dormant, monitoring and assessment of these 

accounts should be done for the fair presentation of the accounts in 

the FS. 

 

2.4.109. We also reiterated our recommendation that Management file 
a request to write-off the dormant receivables that are deemed 

uncollectible in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005 

dated December 19, 2016. 

  



82 

 

 Dormant Liabilities ( Intra-Agency Payables) 
 

2.4.110. In OWWA CO, analysis of the accounts under Liabilities presented 
in the detailed SFPo of OWWA-CO as of December 31, 2020 

disclosed that the following are non-moving liabilities for at least 

three years totaling ₱30,719,562.03, as follows:

2.4.111. Despite being presented as current in the SFPo, those were non-
moving for at least three years to over ten years, which is not a 

characteristic of a current liability. Thus, though the accounts aged 

three years and above may not yet be considered as dormant, 

monitoring and assessment of these accounts should be done for 

the fair presentation. 

 

2.4.112. We recommended that Management file a request for write-off 
for the ₱30,719,562.03 balance of Due to Other Funds, in 

accordance with COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 5, 

1997. 
 
 

Unrestated comparative consolidated FSs of OWWA 

 

2.4.113. Salient points from IPSAS 3 include: 
 

 Paragraph 46 – Errors arising in respect of the recognition, 
measurement, presentation or disclosure of elements of 



83 

 

financial statements. Financial statements do not comply 

with IPSASs if they contain either material errors or 

immaterial errors made intentionally to achieve a particular 

presentation of an entity’s financial position, financial 

performance or cash flows. Potential current period errors 

discovered in that period are corrected before the financial 

statements are authorized for issue. However, material 

errors are sometimes not discovered until a subsequent 

period, and these prior period errors are sometimes not 

discovered until a subsequent period, and these prior period 

errors are corrected in the comparative information 

presented in the financial statements for the subsequent 

period.  

 

  Paragraph 47 - An entity shall correct material prior period 
errors retrospectively in the first set of financial statements 

authorized for issue after their discovery by: 

 

a. restating the comparative amounts for prior 
period(s) presented in which the error occurred; or 

 

b. if the error occurred before the earliest prior period 
presented, restating the opening balances of assets, 

liabilities and net assets/equity for the earliest prior 

period presented 

 

 Paragraph 48 – A prior period error shall be corrected by 
retrospective restatement except to the extent that it is 

impracticable to determine either the period specific effects 

or the cumulative effect of the error. 

 

 Paragraph 54 – In applying paragraph 47, an entity shall 
disclose the following: 

 

a. the nature of the prior period error; 
 

b. for each prior period presented, to the extent 
practicable, the amount of the correction for each 

financial statements line item affected; 

 

c. the amount of the correction at the beginning of the 
earliest prior period presented; and 

 

d. if retrospective restatement is impracticable for a 
particular prior period, the circumstances that led to 



84 

 

the existence of that condition and a description of 

how and from when the error has been corrected. 

 

2.4.114. The OWWA’s comparative Statements of Changes in Net 
Assets/Equity for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 

December 31, 2020 disclosed an amount totaling ₱76,942,622.96 

which pertains to adjustments to correct prior period errors in CY 

2020.  Review of the consolidated FS shows that the Accounting 

Division did not correct these errors through retrospective 

restatement of the prior years’ FS, hence the amounts in the 

comparative consolidated FS of OWWA are not fairly presented. 

 

2.4.115. Further, the Accountant did not provide any disclosures on these 
prior period adjustments which is not in accordance with 

Paragraph 54 of IPSAS 3 as well as with Section 45, Chapter 19 of 

the GAM, Volume I, which provides an illustration of the proper 

procedures and disclosures in the retrospective restatement of 

errors.  

 

2.4.116. Relatively, the objectives of government accounting as enumerated 
in Section 110 of PD No. 1445, which are to “(1) produce 

information concerning past operations and present conditions; 

(2) provide a basis for guidance for future operations; (3) provide 

for control of the acts of public bodies and officers in the receipt, 

disposition and utilization of funds and property; and (4) report on 

the financial position and the results of operations of government 

agencies for the information of all persons concerned,” can only 

be achieved by preparing a reliable and fairly presented FSs.  

 

2.4.117. We recommended that Management require the Accounting 
Division to: 

 

a. analyze the components of the prior period adjustments to 
determine their nature and the affected accounts and 

reflect the changes in the comparative consolidated FSs for 

CYs 2019 and 2020; 

 

b. provide the details of the prior period adjustments for 
presentation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial 

Statements; and  

 

c. comply with paragraph 54 of the IPSAS 3 in the proper 
disclosure and presentation of the retrospective 

application/restatement of errors.

Fund Utilization 

 

3. Out of the ₱5,958,323,000.00 total funds received by the OWWA for 
Emergency Repatriation Fund (ERF), ₱5,673,926,575.23 or 95.23 percent was 

utilized/disbursed for accommodation, transportation, financial assistance and 

other COVID-19 incidental expenses, while expenses charged to the overseas 

operation contingency fund amounted to ₱1,590,537,891.05 as of December 31, 

2020, indicating that the OWWA was able to considerably attend to the needs 

of the OFWs during the pandemic.

3.2. For CY 2020, the approved adjusted appropriation of OWWA for ERF from 
the GAA of FY 2020 or RA No. 11465 was ₱313,323,000.00. With the mass 

arrival of repatriated/displaced/affected OFWs due to the COVID-19 

pandemic, on April 21, 2020, the DBM released to the Agency an additional 

₱145,000,000.00 for the implementation of the ERF with the 

₱15,000,000.00, being part of the appropriations for CY 2019, which was 

not released during that year. With the enactment of RA Nos. 11469  

(Bayanihan 1) and 11494 (Bayanihan 2), another ₱5,000,000,000.00 and 

₱500,000,000.00 were received by the OWWA, respectively, to augment the 

ERF. Actual utilization thereon amounted to ₱5,673,926,575.23, which is 

95.23 percent of the total.  

 

3.3. On the other hand, the OWWA maintains a standby funds for Overseas 
Operation Contingency Fund (OOCF) authorized under Board Resolution 

Nos. 7 and 12, s. 2018 sourced from the OWWA Fund. At the onset of the 

pandemic, before the enactment of RA Nos. 11469 and 11494, the expenses 

for COVID-19 Response such as the financial assistance to the quarantined 

seafarers of the MV Diamond Princess and to stranded OFWs brought about 

by the travel bans imposed by some countries like China or its Special 

Administrative Regions (Hongkong and Macau) and other declared affected 

areas, and those for accommodation, food, transportation and other 



86 

 

administrative expenses were charged to these funds totaling 

₱1,590,537,891.05.

3.5. The remaining balance from the General Fund of ₱284,396,424.77 is a 
continuing appropriation to be utilized for the CY 2021 repatriation expenses 

to address the mass arrival of OFWs daily, whose accommodation and 

transportation expenses are shouldered by the OWWA. 

 

3.6. This shows that the OWWA had significantly provided the needed services 
and assistance to the OFWs and their families during the state of national 

emergency.  

 

3.7. We commended the efforts and services of the OWWA Officers and 
employees headed by its Administrator in responding to the needs of 

repatriated/displaced OFWs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

3.8. The OWWA Administrator commented that amid the threats of the global 
pandemic brought about by the corona virus, the OWWA stood its ground to 

deliver services to OFWs and their families. The OWWA has been in the 

frontline at the onset of the pandemic up to the present, and being 

commended is an energy boost to keep them on the right path. 

 

3.9. The Administrator further stated that they are very grateful to the COA for 
the commendation on their efforts and services in responding to the needs of 

the OFWs.  

 

Non-adherence to the contract with the DOLE-OWWA AKAP Program of the Service 

Provider 

 

4. OWWA failed to enforce the specific provisions of the Contract Agreement 
2020-10 entered into by the OWWA with Michael J. Lhuillier (MLhuillier) 

Financial Services Inc., the Service Provider (SP), on the establishment by the 

SP of separate bank account exclusively for DOLE AKAP Program and the 

submission of the weekly and monthly reports with the list of claimants as of 

December 31, 2020, thus the status of the ₱999,996,000.00 cash transferred to 

MLhuillier, the extent of financial assistance granted to beneficiaries and the 

propriety of disbursements by the SP were not established by OWWA and in 

the audit as of March 1, 2021. 

 

4.1. Item No. 5 of the Terms of Reference (TOR) of the Contract Agreement 
required the SP to open a bank account, exclusively for DOLE-OWWA 

AKAP funds, with an Authorized Government Depository Bank (AGDB), 

preferably the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), to avoid additional bank 

charges. 



88 

 

 

4.2. Likewise, Item Nos. 9 and 10 of the same Terms of Reference (TOR) state 
as follows: 

 

9. Submit weekly report, such as list of beneficiaries who already 

claimed the financial assistance, date and branches where the 

claim was made, inclusive of the amount given and service 

charge. The same shall be submitted to OWWA every end of 

each month, duly supported by consolidated report of 

remittance stating the following (including hard and soft 

copies): 

 

a) Name 
b) Date of Transaction 
c) Date Received 
d) Tracking Number 
e) Branch Location 
f) Amount and Service Charge 

 

10.  Provide photocopy of the IDs presented, as may be requested by 

the OWWA. 

 

4.3. The DOLE was tasked to provide a $200 or ₱10,000.00 each financial 
assistance to displaced OFWs due to the pandemic through the DOLE-

OWWA AKAP for OFWs. When RA No. 11469 (Bayanihan 1) was enacted, 

the funds for the program were with DOLE, with the OWWA tasked to 

initially process and approve the grantees who will be paid by DOLE. 

However, with the enactment of RA No. 11494 (Bayanihan 2), the funds 

were already released by the National Government to the OWWA. 

Consequently, the OWWA Administrator issued MOI No. 014 Series of 

2020 dated August 14, 2020, prescribing the Guidelines on the said Program. 

 

4.4. To provide for an efficient and safe payment facility of the financial 
assistance, OWWA employed the services of MLhuillier Financial Services 

Inc., as the SP, through negotiated procurement, and on August 26, 2020 the 

OWWA and the SP entered into a contract under Contract Agreement 2020-

10. The Contract was intended to serve 85,000 beneficiaries and OWWA 

will pay a service fee of ₱20.00 per remittance.  

 

 

 

 

 

4.5. The contract contained the budgetary requirement and payment terms which 
will be in two tranches, as follows:

Total Service Fee  1,870,000.00 

 

4.6. Under the terms of the contract, the OWWA will provide the SP with a list 
of approved beneficiaries. In Item No. 9 of the TOR, the SP is required to 

submit weekly reports such as list of beneficiaries who already claimed the 

financial assistance, date and branches where the claim was made inclusive 

of amount given and service charge. The same shall be submitted to OWWA 

every end of each month duly supported by a consolidated report of 

remittance, stating the following: 

 

a) Name 
b) Date of Transaction 
c) Date Received 
d) Tracking Number  
e) Branch Location 
f) Amount and Service Charge 

  

4.7. As of December 10, 2020, it was noted that the OWWA had deposited to the 
LBP account of the SP the total amount of ₱999,996,000.000, including 

Service Fee totaling ₱1,996,000.00, for 99,800 approved applications of 

OFW availees. Details are as follows:

4.8. To verify if indeed the amounts were already distributed to the availees, the 
Audit Team requested from the AD the Weekly and Monthly Lists of 

DOLE-OWWA-AKAP for OFW Beneficiaries who already claimed their 

financial assistance. However, the AT was informed that the required reports 

were not yet submitted by the SP, despite repeated demands by the AD. 



90 

 

These reports are significant for Management to determine the extent of 

disbursement of funds by the SP and for recording in the books of the 

OWWA. Likewise, we cannot verify in audit the transactions due to the 

absence of reports. 

 

4.9. Also, it can be gleaned that the amount transferred to the SP and the number 
of beneficiaries was more than those covered by the contract. The excess 

amount that is equivalent to 14,800 grantees was not issued with a 

Supplemental Agreement as basis for payment.  

 

4.10. Likewise, the AT informed that the Land Bank account of the SP where the 
AKAP Funds were deposited was the same bank account used by the SP for 

the Rebate Program of the OWWA, indicating that the SP did not open a 

separate bank account, contrary to the Agreement. The separate bank 

account will facilitate reconciliation and avoid co-mingling of the funds with 

other OWWA program fund.  

 

4.11. In addition, the contract lacks a provision that would state the liability or 
sanction when the erring party breached the stipulation in the contract like 

the non-submission of reports and the non-opening of a separate bank 

account. 

 

4.12. To this effect, OFWs of Region III were paid by DOLE RO III through 
third-party financial platform services provided by MLhuillier Services 

while the evaluation and processing of documents were done by OWWA 

RWO III. The initial payouts started on April 17, 2020 and lasted up to 

September 03, 2020, which totaled ₱135,220,000.00 (13,522 grantees), 

which covered the timeframe provided under RA No. 11469 or the 

Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.  

 

4.13. The OWWA-CO also paid and coursed through MLhuillier the financial 
assistance totaling ₱130,380,000.00 (13,038 grantees) as of November 30, 

2020 for OFWs of Region III whose applications were processed and 

approved by OWWA RWO III. However, a perusal of the lists of approved 

OFWs showed that OWWA RWO III approved and requested for funding 

and payment of 13,044 OFWs, amounting to ₱130,440,000.00 from 

OWWA-CO. Notwithstanding, OWWA-CO paid only 13,038 grantees or a 

difference of six grantees. Upon inquiry on the matter, OWWA RWO III 

failed to explain the reason for the difference. The procedure adopted by the 

Agency and the lack of regular monitoring and reconciliation of payments 

requested and actually made by the OWWA Regional Office effected the 

delay and eventually, non-payment of the eligible beneficiaries under the 

program. 

4.14. We recommended that Management: 
 



91 

 

a. compel the MLhuillier to account for the ₱999,996,000.00 cash 
transferred by submitting the required reports and to transfer any 

balance, including the interest earned from the cash transfers, to a 

bank account exclusively for the DOLE-OWWA-AKAP for OFW 

beneficiaries, pursuant to the contract; 

 

b. require the issuance of Supplemental Agreement to cover the 
amounts transferred not covered by the original Agreement and 

include a provision for penalties in case of non-adherence by the 

contracting party; and 

 

c. conduct a regular monitoring and reconciliation of the request for 
payment and actual payments made to prevent delay or non-

payment of eligible beneficiaries. It is also recommended that 

Management revisit its procedure in the evaluation, approval and 

payment of benefits under the DOLE-AKAP Program for the 

timely, efficient and effective implementation of the program.  
 

4.15. Management explained that they have exerted due diligence and good faith 
in reminding MLhuillier to faithfully abide by the terms and conditions of 

the contract as stated in the TOR, until such time that its representative 

forwarded, thru email, the details of the bank account settlement for the 

OWWA AKAP program. Besides, OWWA has already deposited the 

amount intended for the OFW beneficiaries of DOLE-OWWA-AKAP 

project, including service fees to MLhuillier. However, MLhuillier failed to 

satisfactorily deliver/perform its obligations despite repeated calls, follow-

ups and reminders. Thus, they have sent the SP a letter demanding to pay 

liquidated damages of one-tenth (1/10) of one percent of the cost for every 

day of delay pursuant to Section 3 of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184. 

 

4.16. On March 2, 2021, the COA had received a soft copy of the report of 
MLhuillier, yet the timelines prescribed in the contract was not adhered to. 

Due to time constraints, the AT was not able to verify the report as against 

the funds transferred to the company.  

 

4.17. Management commented that in order to prevent the delay of payment to 
DOLE-AKAP qualified beneficiaries; they will have a close coordination 

with DOLE RO3 to ascertain the problems and difficulties that they are 

encountering on transmitting the financial assistance to OFWs. 

 

Availment by non-eligible recipients of DOLE-AKAP for OFWs 

 

5. A total of 63 ineligible DOLE-OWWA AKAP recipients from RWOs NCR, I, X 
and XIII were able to avail the financial assistance from the program, contrary 

to Section II of MOI No. 014, series of 2020; while in RWO V, two unqualified 

recipients were able to claim from MLhuillier the DOLE AKAP financial 



92 

 

assistance of an OFW who left already for abroad, and financial assistance to 

three recipients from RWO XIII were sourced from the OWWA fund instead 

of from the General Fund.  
 

5.1. Section II of MOI No. 014 provides the following: 
  

“The following are no longer eligible to receive the financial 

assistance: 

 

1. Those who received ₱10,000.00 special cash assistance under 
OWWA Special Order No. 053, Series No. 2020, Special 

Financial Assistance to the Stranded OFWs due to the 2019 Novel 

Corona Virus Acute Respiratory Disease (2019 NCOV ARD); 

2. Those who received ₱10,000.00 financial assistance under the 
DOLE-AKAP; or 

3. Those whose employment contracts have expired or terminated 
for reasons other than the COVID-19 pandemic;  

 

5.2. The funds for the DOLE-OWWA AKAP, as approved under the Bayanihan 
1, was initially handed over to the DOLE. The selection of eligible grantees 

was delegated to the OWWA RWOs, which provided the DOLE with the 

names of the approved grantees. 

 

5.3. Verification and validation of the DOLE-OWWA AKAP approved 
recipients disclosed that 63 beneficiaries of the program from the following 

RWOs were recipients already either of the special cash assistance or the 

DOLE AKAP, and/or with expired contracts or terminated for reasons other 

than the COVID-19 pandemic rendering these OFWs ineligible to avail the 

financial assistance from the program, contrary to the above-cited provision, 

to wit: 

 

RWOs No. of Ineligible Beneficiaries 

NCR 54 

I 2 

X  6 

XIII  1 

Total 63 

  

5.4. Moreover, two unqualified recipients authorized by OWWA RWO V were 
able to claim from MLhuillier the DOLE-AKAP financial assistance of the 

OWWA member who already left for abroad. 

 

5.5. Also, payments to three DOLE-OWWA AKAP recipients from RWO XIII 
were sourced from the OWWA Fund instead of from the GF transferred by 

the OWWA-CO. 

 



93 

 

5.6. We recommended to the Managements of the concerned RWOs to: 
 

a. require the responsible personnel to verify the double payments 
and determine proper action to be done for the return of the 

overpayment to DOLE, if warranted;  

 

b. require the responsible personnel to evaluate the eligibility of the 
applicant-OFWs ensuring that exclusions are imposed; 

 

c. document in the Benefits Availment Program (BAP) the results of 
evaluation to ensure that no double claims/payments to OFWs are 

made; 

 

d. RWO V, to refrain from allowing unqualified persons to claim the 
benefit due the OWWA member-OFWs; and 

 

e. RWO XIII, to ensure that disbursements made are supported with 
available funds earmarked for the specific program to be 

implemented to avoid erroneous charging.  
 

5.7. The Management commented as follows: 
 

Office Management Comments 

RWO NCR a. The DOLE AKAP program and Novel Corona Virus Acute 
Respiratory Disorder (NCOV ARD) are separate and distinct 

and sourced from different funds, namely DOLE CAMP under 

Bayanihan Acts 1 and 2 and OOCF, respectively; therefore, no 

double availment occurred; 

 

b. Bayanihan 2 (RA No. 11494) also states that subsidy provided 
under this Act for repatriated OFWs shall be separate and 

distinct from the benefits or assistance, if any, they received as 

OWWA members; and  

 

c. there will be no recoupment from the concerned OFWs since 
the financial assistance was actually received by qualified 

beneficiaries. Given the above circumstances, the evaluators 

acted with prudence, due diligence and in good faith in 

evaluating and approving the applications of the concerned 

beneficiaries. 

RWO I Management already tried to communicate with the double-paid 

beneficiaries to voluntarily surrender the excess payment and 

committed to intensify their control measures to avoid 

duplication in the future. 

RWO V Management committed to refrain from allowing unauthorized 

person to claim the benefit due to OWWA member-OFWs. 

RWO X Management will exhaust all efforts to recover/recollect the 

excess payment to the ineligible applicants and commits to 



94 

 

Office Management Comments 

thoroughly screen applicants for financial assistance programs 

with criteria and release financial assistance only to eligible 

applicants. 

 

Auditors’ Rejoinder 

 

5.8. In the case of RWO NCR, the AT suggested that the requirement for 
exclusions for availment under Item II of MOI No. 014 series of 2020 be 

amended accordingly. 

 

5.9. During the Exit Conference, the OWWA Administrator informed that MOI 
No. 014 series of 2020 will be amended accordingly as there were issuances 

by the DOLE Secretary superseding Item II of the said MOI. 

 

 

Payments of COVID-19 related expenditures, not supported with adequate documents 

 

6. Payments made by the OWWA-CO, RWOs IV-B, V, XI and XIII for 
hotel/accommodation facilities, transportation, food and other incidental 

expenses totaling ₱29,740,845.55 were not supported with the required 

documents, contrary to Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445, COA Circular Nos. 2012-

001 dated June 14, 2012 and 2004-006 dated September 9, 2004 rendering the 

propriety and validity of the transactions doubtful. 

 

6.1. The relevant regulations are as follows: 
 

 Section 4, Paragraph 6 of PD No. 1445 states the following: 
 

6. Claims against government funds shall be supported with 

complete documentation. 

 

 COA Circular No. 2012-001 enumerates the General Requirements 
for all types of disbursements. 

 

 COA Circular No. 2004-006 providing the guidelines for 
disbursements of government funds where evidence of receipt of 

payment is a requirement. 

 

 Item 3.3.1(c) of the same Circular provides that a paper-based 
evidence of receipt of payment may take the form of 

Acknowledgment Receipt (AR). 

 

6.2. To attend to the needs of displaced OFWs, the Agency implemented 
“PROJECT CARE” under MOI No. 003 series of 2020 which took effect on 

March 21, 2020. The MOI prescribes the Guidelines for the Provision of 



95 

 

Hotel Accommodation for Distressed and Stranded Land-based and Sea-

based OFWs during the Period of ECQ or until the lifting of social 

distancing measures in the entire Luzon. As such, OWWA provided hotel 

accommodations, point-to-point transport and food to the 

repatriated/displaced OFWs. The requirements for eligibility to the Project 

Care consist of the Travel Passport and/or Travel Documents and 

Certification as OFW repatriates from the OWWA Repatriation and 

Assistance Division (RAD).2  

 

6.3. In view of the urgency of the situation and to avoid delays in the payment of 
COVID-19 related expenses, several cash advances were granted by the 

OWWA to SDOs. 

 

6.4. Audit of expenses as well as Liquidation Reports (LRs) of SDOs for hotel/ 
accommodation facilities, transportation, food and other incidental 

expenditures disclosed that COVID-19 related expenditures totaling 

₱29,740,845.55 were not supported with the required documents, as follows:

a. submit the lacking documents; and 
 

b. refrain from recording as liquidation of cash advances the 
Reports of Disbursements or LRs which are not supported with 

documents required under COA Circular No. 2012-001. 

 

6.6. Management commented as follows: 
 

Office Management Comment/s 

OWWA-CO Due to time constraints and to act in expeditious manner, 

they were not able to secure three quotations on the 

domestic tickets that were provided to the seafarers for 

their return to their respective provinces. Also, the SDO 

stated that Cebu Pacific flights were the available and 

cheapest domestic fare at that time.  

RWO IV-B, 

V and XI 

Management committed to submit the required 

documents. 

RWO VI Management informed that the protocols employed in the 

management of the arrival of returning OFWs in Western 

Visayas as a joint undertaking of the Regional Task 

Force (RTF) and Regional Inter-Agency Task Force 

(RIATF), with OWWA being designated as Sub-Task 

Unit (STU) is the non-requirement of documents, such 

as, passports to arriving OFWs, to safeguard government 

frontliners and protect the limited manpower 

complement assigned in the facilitation and assistance of 

arriving OFWs. Instead, RTF-RIATF arrival forms were 

required to be filled up with their pertinent information. 



98 

 

Office Management Comment/s 

This scheme, according to Management, is also giving 

merit to the processes of management of OFWs prior to 

boarding OWWA sweeper flights in NAIA. In addition, 

OWWA RWO VI further checks from the list of arrivals 

the identity of OFWs assisted thru OWWA online 

database/POEA database and print their individual 

Membership Record and both documents served as 

attachment to all payments made by OWWA RWO VI, 

particularly for the hotel accommodation of OFWs to 

attest that said workers have availed the services and 

assistance of OWWA.  

RWO IX Management stated that there was no Advance Manifest 

forwarded to RWO IX from the CO, thus they relied on 

the photo information sent by CAAP in NAIA via 

Messenger, which, mostly, did not coincide with the 

actual number of arriving Repatriated Overseas Filipinos 

(ROFs). Further, as for the food served to the ROFs in 

the hotels, they relied on the check-in registration to 

avoid contact; they just left food at the door of the 

assigned hotel rooms of ROFs. 

 

Auditors’ Rejoinder 

 

6.7. The Auditors rejoined as follows: 
 

Office Rejoinder 

OWWA-CO The Audit Team acknowledged the receipt of all lacking 

documents mentioned in the observation, the validity 

thereof is still for their evaluation. Nonetheless, we would 

like to reiterate strict adherence with the provisions under 

COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 on the 

prompt liquidation of the CAs to prevent the funds 

authorized for spending by the Agency from being 

exposed to possible loss or risk of misuse. 

RWO VI The submission and/or presentation of the required 

documentation, found to be lacking as support in the 

payments made by the Agency, is for the Audit Team to 

make certain that government funds are duly accounted 

for and the program of the government has met its 

objectives. 

RWO IX It is for the best interest of the service that Agency 

officials comply with existing rules and regulations and 

account for the incurred expenditures.

Other noted deficiencies on COVID-19 expenditures 

 

7. Other deficiencies were noted in the audit of COVID-19 related expenditures in 
the OWWA-CO and RWOs I, IX and XIII, such as: a) doubtful charges from 

the cash advance totaling ₱1,269,920.00 for the hygiene kits, bottled water and 

snacks procured from Construction and Trading Store and/or Suppliers, which 

are not procured from reputable drugstores and supermarkets; b) payments of 

₱4,343,120.00 from the advances instead of directly to the Suppliers, thru the 

DV system; c) a designated Collecting Officer is performing a special 

disbursing function; and d) DVs totaling ₱15,905,130.00 were neither stamped 

paid nor certified by the Accountant, contrary to Sections 2 and 4 of PD No. 

1445, COA Circular Nos. 92-389 and 97-002 dated November 3, 1992 and 

February 10, 1997, respectively. 

 

7.1. Section 2 of PD No. 1445 provides as follows: 
 

Section 2. It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of 

the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in 

accordance with law and regulations and safeguarded against loss 

or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to 

ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations 

of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is 

faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the 

government agency concerned. 

 

 

7.2. Likewise, Paragraph 5, Section 4 of the same PD states the following: 
 

5. Disbursements or disposition of government funds or property shall 

invariably bear the approval of the proper officials. 

 

7.3. Moreover, No. 2 (Q) of COA Circular No. 92-389 dated November 3, 1992 
states that: 

 

Paid vouchers, including its supporting documents, shall be 

perforated and conspicuously stamped Paid by the Cashier. 

  

7.4. While Section 36, Volume II of the GAM provides the form and the 
instruction in filling out the JEV, as follows: 

 

This form shall be used to record all transactions of the NGAs, 

whether cash receipts, cash disbursements or non-cash 

transactions. Accounting journal entries shall be reflected therein 

and it shall serve as the basis for recording in the books of 

accounts.  

 



100 

 

7.5. Section of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 states as 
follows: 

 

2. GENERAL PRINCIPLES 

 

Ideally, cash should be handled under the general principles of the 

imprest system, to wit:  

 

1. Daily receipts on collections must be deposited intact with the 
proper bank.  

2. All payments must be made by check.  
3. Only payments in small amounts may be made through the 

petty cash fund. Replenishment of the petty cash fund shall be 

equal to the total amount of expenditures made therefrom. 

 

In practice, however, there are certain instances when it may be 

very difficult, impractical or impossible to make payments by 

check. In such a case, payments may be made by the disbursing 

officer in the form of cash through his cash advance. 
 

7.6. Audit of disbursements/LRs in the OWWA-CO and RWO XIII disclosed the 
following: 

 

OWWA-CO 

 

a) Out of the ₱2,011,441.90 covered by LR No. FM-OWWA 07-10.4, the 
propriety and regularity of the expenditures charged to the CA of a 

Deputy Administrator totaling ₱1,269,920.00 is doubtful due to the 

awarding of the procurement transactions not to reputable drugstores and 

supermarkets. This is an indication that OWWA’s resources were not 

expended in accordance with rules and regulations and is contrary to 

Section 2, PD No. 1445.  

 

The procurement transactions referred to were the following: 

 

Hygiene kits, sanitary napkins and thermal scanners aggregating 

₱969,920.00 were procured from MRCJP Construction and Trading with 

business address at 80 M Cornejo St., Malibay, Brgy. 161, Pasay City, 

which establishment cannot be found on the address stated in the 

Collection Receipt (CR) issued for the procurement transactions, after an 

ocular inspection made by the Audit Team. Details are as follows:

Moreover, the following were likewise noted: 

 

 The composition of the hygiene kits costing ₱160.00 per kit 
was not itemized; 

 The procured sanitary napkins (₱10, ₱20, ₱30) per pad is very 
costly, the napkins can be bought in small sari-sari stores at 

₱5.00 –₱8.00 per pad only; 

  Internet prices of thermal scanners ranged from ₱400 to ₱800 
only as compared to the ones charged to CA which is 

₱2,950.00 per unit; 

 It is unlikely that these items were bought from a store which 
deals with construction supplies or hardware, considering that 

the Mercury Drugstore is just around the vicinity of the 

OWWA. 

 

Likewise, the following purchases of bottled water and snack items such 

as Lemon Square, Fudgee Bar, Dowee Donut, Cupcakes with total cost 

of ₱300,000.00 were procured from a caterer with business address at 

Tandang Sora, Old Balara, Quezon City. These items are available in 

Supermarkets/Hypermarkets within the vicinity of Pasay City. The Audit 

Team also noted that the unit price of the items procured was not 

indicated in the ORs issued by the caterer, to wit:

as basis for recording and in conformity with the GAM for NGAs. 

 

RWO I 

 

c) Disbursements on the implementation of the Project Care and Hatid- 
Sundo programs/activities with an aggregate amount of ₱4,343,120.00 

were made through CAs by the SDOs instead of direct payment to 

suppliers, which is not in conformity with Section 2 of COA Circular 

No. 97-002, resulting in large amounts of CAs to the SDOs during the 

year, thus exposing government funds to risk of loss or 

misappropriation. 

 

RWO IX 

 

d) A designated Collecting Officer is performing a special disbursing 
function, contrary to Section 30, GAM for NGAs, Volume I and Section 

4.1.5 of COA Circular No. 97-002.

e) All DVs were not certified by the Accountant as to availability of funds 
and completeness of documents, contrary to Section 4(5) of PD No. 

1445. 

  



103 

 

7.7. We recommended that Management of: 
 

 OWWA-CO 

 

a. require the Deputy Administrator/AO to: 
 

 justify why the procurement transactions were awarded to a 
construction and trading company and to a caterer instead of 

buying the items from reputable drugstores and supermarkets; 

 show proof on the reasonableness of the prices of the procured 
items; 

 submit an itemized list of the procured items with the unit 
prices indicated therein; 

 compel the suppliers of goods and services to issue Sales 
Invoice/ORs on the said transaction; and 

 submit the IAR for all delivered materials/supplies/goods;  
 

b. instruct the Accountant to prepare JEV and attach them to the 
DVs;  

 

RWO I 

 

c. to stop the practice of paying expenditures in cash, rather make a 
direct payment to the Suppliers/hoteliers; 

 

RWO IX 

 

d. to avoid assigning the disbursing function to a Collecting Officer at 
the same time; and 

 

RWO XIII 

 

e. to require the Accountant to sign the DVs or explain the reasons 
for not certifying the same. 

 

7.8. RWO I Management explained that the van rentals totaling ₱29,000.00 were 
paid through CA, giving foremost consideration to serving the public interest 

during the period of the ECQ, and henceforth, committed to comply with the 

recommendation. 

 

 

Lapses/deficiencies in the handling of CAs 

 

8. Lapses were noted in the granting, utilization and liquidation of CAs, such that 
cash advances were not liquidated on time in the OWWA-CO, cash advances 

were granted to AOs with previous unliquidated CA in RWO VI and CAs were 



104 

 

distributed to several OWWA personnel in RWO XI, thereby exposing the 

funds to possible loss and is contrary to COA Circular No. 97-002 dated 

February 10, 1997 and Section 30, Chapter 6, GAM for NGAS, Volume I.  

 

8.1. The pertinent provisions of COA Circular No.97-002 dated February 10, 
1997 are as follows:  

 

Section 4.1.2 No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any 

official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him 

is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.  

 

Section 4.1.3 A cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the 

purpose for which it was given has been served. 

 

Section 4.1.5 Only duly appointed or designated disbursing 

officers may perform disbursing functions. Officers and employees 

who are given cash advances for official travel need not be 

designated as Disbursing Officers. 

 

Section 4.1.6 Transfer of cash advance from one Accountable 

Officer (AO) to another shall not be allowed. 

 

Section 5.3 Within ten (10) days after receipt of the report and 

supporting documents from the AO, the Accountant shall verify 

the report, record it in the books and submit the same with all the 

vouchers/payrolls and supporting documents to the Auditor. The 

cash advance shall be considered liquidated upon the recording 

thereof by the Accountant in the books of accounts although not 

yet audited by the COA auditor. 

 

Section 5.7 When a cash advance is no longer needed or has not 

been used for a period of two (2) months, it must be returned to or 

refunded immediately to the collecting officer.  

 

Section 5.8 All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of 

each year. Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any 

unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will 

issue the necessary official receipt. 
 

8.2. Also, Section 30, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states that:  
 

Sec. 30. Cash Advance for Specific Purpose/Time-Bound 

Undertaking. Cash advance for special purpose/time-bound 

undertaking shall be granted only to duly authorized accountable 

officer/special disbursing officer. It shall be accounted for in the 

books of accounts as “Advances to Special Disbursing Officer.” It 

shall be liquidated by the accountable officer within a specified 



105 

 

period. Any unutilized cash advance shall be refunded and an OR 

shall be issued to acknowledge collection thereof. 

 

8.3. Due to the exigency of the situation brought about by the COVID-19 
pandemic, and in line with the OWWA’s Project Care, CAs were granted to 

designated SDOs at the OWWA-CO and the RWOs intended for the 

expenses to be incurred in overseeing the mass repatriation of 

displaced/repatriated OFWs.  

 

8.4. Audit of the CAs and the corresponding LRs of the designated SDOs for 
COVID-19 response in the OWWA-CO and RWOs VI and XI revealed 

various deficiencies/lapses in the handling, utilization and liquidation of cash 

advances. Details are as follows: 

 

Office Deficiencies 

CO 1. Non-adherence by the SDOs/AD on the timelines in the liquidation 
and settlement of CAs and submission of reports, thus hindered the 

AT from conducting timely audit of transactions and exposing the 

cash advance to possible loss or risk of misuse.  

 2. Out of the ₱26,540,000.00 CAs granted to 12 SDOs for the period 
May to December 2020, the aggregate amount of ₱11,240,000.00 

remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020, contrary to Nos. 

4.1, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 

1997, on the granting, utilization and liquidation of CAs, hence the 

expended portion of the CAs remained unrecorded in the books of 

accounts of the OWWA as at yearend.  

RWO 

I 

Transfer of CA from one AO to another was noted posing risk of loss 

or misappropriation of the cash accountabilities of the AOs to whom 

the CAs were originally granted. 

RWO 

VI 

CAs totaling ₱1,100,000.00 were granted to OWWA RWO VI Officers 

with outstanding CAs, contrary to Section 89 of PD No. 1445 and 

COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, thereby exposing 

government funds to risk of possible loss or misapplication. 

RWO 

XI 

Two CAs granted to two AOs totaling ₱750,000.00 for the 

implementation of the ERP were distributed to several agency 

personnel, contrary to COA Circular No. 97-002, thereby exposing the 

government funds to risk of loss or misuse. 

 

8.5. We recommended the following: 
 

Office  Recommendations 

CO a. submit an explanation why the liquidation for COVID-19 
related expenses for the Filipino seafarers of MV Diamond 

Princess was submitted more than three months after the 

purpose of the CA was served; and 

b. oblige the concerned SDOs to immediately liquidate their 
CAs, otherwise instruct the Accountant to cause the 

withholding of their salaries pursuant to Item 9 of COA 

Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1977. 



106 

 

Office  Recommendations 

RWOs 

I and 

XI 

stop the practice of transferring the CAs from an AO to another 

AO. 

RWO 

VI 

strictly adhere to the provisions of Section 89 of PD No. 1445, and 

COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 that no CA 

shall be granted to AOs with unliquidated CA.  

 

8.6. Management and concerned SDOs commented as follows: 
 

Office  Management Comments 

CO a. The SDO for Filipino seafarers of the COVID-infested Cruise 
Ship stated that it took three months to submit the documents due 

to restrictions imposed by the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) 

doctors for safety reasons since the documents submitted by the 

seafarers may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus. As such, 

all documents were put on hold at the quarantine room of OWWA 

Region III for sanitation.  

b. The AD informed that only three out of the seven SDOs have not 
yet fully liquidated their CAs. The two SDOs have already 

submitted their LRs and are subject to review, the other one has 

not submitted yet the LR and demand letter was already sent. Final 

Demand Letter will be sent to the SDO to be answered within five 

days, otherwise Management will push thru with the withholding 

of her salary pursuant to Item No. 9 of COA Circular No. 97-002 

dated February 10, 1997. 

RWO 

VI 

Management furnished the AT a document showing electronic 

submissions of documents relevant to the liquidation of CAs sent to 

Agency personnel other than the Accountant, on a date earlier than the 

reflected date of receipt and recording by the Accounting Section. In 

addition, they stated that the observance of strict home quarantines of 

the AOs, the absence of regular employees other than the AO who 

was granted the CAs and the urgency of the CAs contributed to the 

delay in liquidation. Further, it was also informed that the expenses 

incurred and paid prior to the grant of CA were refunded on January 

14, 2021. 

 

Auditors’ Rejoinder 

 

8.7. The ATs rejoined as follows: 
 

Office  Rejoinder 

CO The AT acknowledged the efforts Management has exerted in order 

to provide immediate services to repatriated/displaced/affected OFWs 

amidst all the challenges and risks brought about by the COVID-19 

pandemic. The AT understands the difficulties such as time 

constraints and government-imposed restrictions as a contributing 

factor for the delays incurred in the submission of documents for 

liquidations. However, we would like to reiterate strict adherence to 



107 

 

Office  Rejoinder 

COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 on the prompt 

liquidation of the CAs. 

RWO 

VI 

The AT is cognizant of the tireless service of the employees and 

officials of OWWA RWO VI, as well as their conscious attempts to 

adhere to the law, regulations, and prior COA observations while 

risking their health and safety in the name of public service. It is, 

however, the mandate of the COA to ensure that government funds 

are properly accounted for and safeguarded even in this time of the 

pandemic. Further, based on the presented timing difference between 

the submissions of relevant documents for liquidation and the date 

reflected in the LR as to the receipt and recording of the Accountant, 

this Office recommends that proper coordination between the 

different departments and/or personnel of the Agency be strengthened 

so as to avoid similar situations in the future. 

 

Non-compliance with the bonding requirements 

 

9. Some designated SDOs of OWWA-CO, NCR and RWO VIII were either not 
bonded, with deficient and/or expired bond, thus cash accountabilities were not 

insured in case of loss or possible misuse and is contrary to Item d, Section 14, 

Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I and Annex C of Treasury Circular 

No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009.  

 

9.1. Item d, Section 14, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides as 
follows: 

 

d) Except for cash advance for official travel, no officer or employee 

shall be granted cash advance unless he/she is properly bonded in 

accordance with existing laws or regulations. The amount of cash 

advance which may be granted shall not exceed the maximum 

cash accountability covered by his/her bond; 

 

9.2. Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009 Annex C provides the 
maximum cash accountability of AOs per amount of bond applied for.

Office  Deficiencies 

CO CAs in the aggregate amount of ₱1,300,000.00 for COVID-19 related 

expenses were granted to two SDOs who are not bonded. Likewise, 

the total amount of ₱16,590,000.00 CAs granted to four SDOs 

exceeded the maximum cash accountability covered by bond, 

contrary to Item d, Section 14, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I and Annex C of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated 

August 6, 2009.  

RWO 

NCR 

The RWO NCR granted CAs totaling ₱1,000,000.00 to two SDOs 

with expired bonds, and the amount of CAs exceeded the maximum 

cash accountability covered by the bond, contrary to applicable 

regulations.  

RWO 

VII 

CAs amounting to ₱2,216,478.25 for COVID-19 response 

weregranted to SDOs who were inadequately or not bonded. 

 

9.4. We recommended, and the OWWA-CO and the respective RWOs 
agreed, to: 

 

a. OWWA-CO, to refrain from granting CAs to SDOs who are not 
bonded and to apply for the bond of the two SDOs who were not 

bonded; 

 

b. OWWA-CO and RWO-NCR, to increase the bonds of the SDOs to 
sufficiently cover the maximum cash accountability for a given 

period in accordance with the Schedule of Bonds provided by the 

Bureau of the Treasury (BTr); 

 

c. require the Accountant of RWO VII to check the bond of the SDO 
before the CA is released; and 

 

d. RWO NCR and RWO VII, to apply for the renewal of the bonds of 
AOs before their expiration dates. 

 

9.5. In a Memo dated May 8, 2021, Management submitted the Confirmation 
Letters from the BTr for AOs with renewed/increased bonds covering the 

period January 2020 to May 18, 2021.

Non-compliance with RA No. 9184, the Government Procurement Reform Act, and the 

Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Circular No. 01-2020 dated April 6, 

2020 
 

10. RWOs I, IX and X did not update/revise their Annual Procurement Plan (APP) 
for the procurement of goods and services relative to COVID-19, contrary to 

Section 7.2 of the RIRR of RA No. 9184, Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of the 

Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Circular No. 01-2020 dated 

April 6, 2020, thus affecting the validity and propriety of the transactions 

amounting to ₱11,878,711.03. 

 

10.1. Section 7.2 of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 provides that “No procurement 
shall be undertaken unless it is in accordance with approved APP, including 

approved changes thereto. The APP must be consistent with duly approved 

yearly budget of the Procuring Entity and shall bear the approval of the 

HoPE or second-ranking official designated by the HoPE to act on his 

behalf.” 

 

10.2. Moreover, Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of the GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 dated 
April 6, 2020 provides as follows: 

 
3.1. PEs shall prepare the project requirements, with the following details:  

 

a. Project Name; 
b. Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC); 
c. Technical Specifications, Scope of Work, or Terms of Reference; 
d. Date of Delivery or Implementation; 
e. Required quantity; and  
f. Other relevant information that the PE may require 

 

3.2Once the budget for the Procurement Project has been validated by 

the budget officer or equivalent position, the Procurement Project 

shall be included in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP) 

approved by the Head of the Procuring Entity (HoPE) or his or 

her delegate. 

 

However, in view of the urgent necessity of the procurement 

covered under the Bayanihan Act, the Procuring Entity (PE) may 

commence with the procurement even without an approved APP, 

provided there is a document or certification from the budget 

officer or equivalent position showing that there is a budget for 

the purpose. The APP shall be approved thereafter and posted on 

the PE’s website and submitted to the Government Procurement 

Policy Board (GPPB) or posted on the GPPB online portal for 

Emergency Procurement under the Bayanihan Act, once 

operational, on or before September 30, 2020.

Not stated 

 Total 11,878,711.03 

 

10.4. As a general rule, the APP is required prior to the conduct of Emergency 
Procurement. However, in view of the urgent necessity of the procurement 

covered under the Bayanihan to Heal and Recover as One Acts, the Agency 

may commence with the procurement even without an approved APP, 

provided there is a document or Certification from the Budget Officer or 

equivalent position showing that there is a budget for the purpose. The APP 

shall be approved thereafter and posted on the Procuring Entity’s website 

and submitted to the GPPB. 

 

10.5. We recommended to the concerned RWOs to: 
 

a. direct the BAC, through the BAC Secretariat, to update the APP to 
include all procurements to be undertaken by the Agency; and  

 

b. strictly adhere to the aforementioned provisions for the 
procurement of goods and services for COVID-19 related expenses. 

 

10.6. The RWO IX Management stated that the transactions were done during the 
height of the pandemic, hence majority, if not all, of the hotels were closed 

and only L’Meridian and Casa Latino responded to our call to open their 

hotels for the Repatriated Overseas Filipinos (ROFs). Moreover, PhilGEPS 

was not accessible for posting during ECQ.

Non-posting of emergency procurement in the GPPB Online Portal 
 

11. OWWA-CO, RWOs I, IX and X did not post in the GPPB Online Portal/ 
PhilGEPS’ website their emergency procurements with total amount of 

₱4,606,155,049.15, contrary to Section 3.6 of GPPB Circular No. 01-2020, 

GPPB Advisory No. 05-2020, Section 54.3 and Section 7.2 of the 2016 RIRR of 

RA No. 9184. 

 

11.1. Section 54.3 of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 states that “in all instances of 
alternative methods of procurement, the BAC, through the Secretariat, shall 

post, for information purposes, the notice of award, contract or purchase 

order, including notice to proceed if necessary, in the PhilGEPS website, the 

website of the Procuring Entity concerned, if available, and at any 

conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the premises of the Procuring 

Entity, except for contracts with ABC of Fifty Thousand Pesos (₱50,000.00) 

and below. 

 

11.2. This was reiterated in Section 3.6 of GPPB Circular No. 1-2020 dated April 
6, 2020 which provides that “the BAC, through its Secretariat, shall post for 

information purposes the Notice of Award (NOA), contract, or purchase 

order in (i) the website of the PE or if none, any conspicuous place in the 

premises of the PE; and (ii) the GPPB online portal for Emergency 

Procurement under the Bayanihan Act, once it becomes operational.”

22,725,927.46 

 Total 4,606,155,049.15 

 

11.4. We recommended to the concerned RWOs to: 
 

a. justify the basis for not complying with the requirements on posting 
and ensure that all emergency procurement transactions under the 

Bayanihan Act are posted on the GPPB Online Portal; and  

 

b. post the NOA, Contract, or Purchase Order in the OWWA website 
or on any conspicuous place of the Agency’s premises and the GPPB 

portal, for transparency. 

 

11.5. The OWWA-CO explained that they are in constant communication with the 
GPPB and a meeting will be set to discuss OWWA’s situations, as OWWA 

engaged the services of their SPs for hotels/accommodation facilities, 

transportation services and food, as the need arises, while RWO I stated that 

they were not aware of such GPPB regulations, on the other hand, RWO IX 

commented that these transactions were done during the height of the 

pandemic, thus majority, if not all, of the hotels were closed and only 

L’Meridian and Casa Latino responded to the Agency’s call to open their 

hotels for ROFs and PhilGEPS was not accessible for posting during that 

time. 

 

 

Payments not subjected to creditable tax 

 

12. Procurement totaling ₱3,010,750.00 of RWOs IV-B and XIII were made 
through cash advances, hence not subjected to the withholding of creditable 

tax, contrary to Section 93 of PD No. 1445 and Revenue Memorandum 

Circular No. 23-2012 dated February 4, 2012. 

 



113 

 

12.1. Section 93 of PD No. 1445 provides as follows: 
 

To whom warrants or checks payable. Warrants chargeable to 

revenue or trust funds of the national government or checks drawn 

against the Treasury Checking Account for Agencies maintained 

with any government depository shall be made payable either 

directly to the creditor to whom the money is due or to a disbursing 

officer for official disbursement. 

 

12.2. In addition, Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 23-2012 dated February 4, 
2012 stated that the Head of Offices and Chief Accountant/s or other persons 

holding similar positions in departments, bureaus, agencies, instrumentalities 

officially designated as such by the head of office are responsible for the 

correct withholding of taxes. 

 

12.3. Procurement of catering services from a single supplier amounting to 
₱490,000.00 through CA by the RWO IV-B and disbursements out of the 

CAs for the Project Care totaling ₱2,520,750.00 of RWO XIII were not in 

accordance with the above-cited regulations.  

 

12.4. We recommended that concerned personnel of RWOs IV-B and XIII 
ensure that payments on purchases be made directly to 

suppliers/contractors pursuant to Section 93 of PD No. 1445 and 

deduct/withhold the corresponding taxes due the government in 

accordance with Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 23-2012 dated 

February 14, 2012. 
 

 

Audit of Regular OWWA Transactions 

 

Delayed/non-submission of financial reports and supporting documents 

 

13. The delayed/non-submission of financial reports and documents in eight RWOs 
hindered the timely verification and audit of the RWO’s transactions, thus 

errors and deficiencies found in audit could not be effected at once and is not in 

accordance with Sections 122 of PD No. 1445, Section 60, Chapter 19 of GAM 

for NGAs, Volume I and Sections 7.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated 

September 15, 2009. 

 

13.1. Section 122 of PD No. 1445 provides that “Whenever deemed necessary in 
the exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued 

by it require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, 

disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers and other 

responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, 

physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other 

reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions. Failure on the 



114 

 

part of the officials concerned to submit the documents and reports 

mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of payment of 

their salaries until they shall have complied with the requirements of the 

Commission.” 

 

13.2. Likewise, COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 provides that: 
 

Accountable officers shall submit records of receipts, disbursements, 

expenditures, operations, and all other documents, to the Chief 

Accountants in the manner and within the time frame prescribed in 

existing rules and regulations. 

 

Disbursing Officers in particular shall faithfully comply with Section 

100 of PD No. 1445 which requires them to render monthly reports of 

their transactions pursuant to existing auditing regulations not later 

than the fifth day of the ensuing month to the auditor concerned. The 

official involved in the daily recording of transactions in the books of 

accounts shall turn over the receipts and the disbursement records with 

all paid vouchers and documents evidencing the transaction to the 

Auditor within ten (10) days from date of receipt of said documents. 

 

13.3. Section 5.3 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides 
that “within ten (10) days after receipt of the report and supporting 

documents from the AO, the accountant shall verify the report, record it in 

the books and submit the same with all the vouchers/payrolls and supporting 

documents to the Auditor.” 

 

13.4. Section 7.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 
provides that “The head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all 

government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: 

a) the required financial and other reports and statements are submitted by 

the concerned agency officials in such form and within the period prescribed 

by the Commission, xxx.” 

 

13.5. Based on the above provisions, the following shall be furnished to COA 
within the prescribed period for proper analysis, verification and 

examination:

13.8. The delayed submission of the required reports and its supporting documents 
affected the timely examination and verification of the transactions by the 

AT and the timely correction of errors, if any.  

 

13.9. We recommended that Management require the Accounting Unit of the 
respective RWOs to prepare and submit the required quarterly and 

year-end TBs, FSs and pertinent supporting schedules/reports within 

the prescribed deadline. 

 

13.10. Management comments are as follows: 
 

Office Comments 

RWO II Management committed the timely submission of the financial 

reports for the succeeding period. 

RWO  

IV-A 

The Regional Accountant was instructed to submit on time the 

financial reports and their supporting documents as prescribed 

under COA Circular No. 2009-006 and Section 60.b, Chapter 

19 and Section 32, Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

DVs, together with the supporting documents as well as the 

LRs, had been submitted to the Office of the Auditor. 

RWO  

IV-B 

Management commented that the DVs for the months of 

February to June 2020 are ready for submission to the Office 

of the Auditor. However, the DVs for July to December 2020 

are still on file for they are currently working on the 

completion of attachments thereto such as Deposit Slips, 

Payee’s Undertaking and bank account details. 

RWO  Management committed that they will submit immediately to 



117 

 

Office Comments 

V the AT the 253 original DVs and their supporting documents. 

 

They justified that due to the overwhelming increase in the 

transactions, the Agency experienced drastic changes where 

all are to be prioritized. The normal transactions which can be 

done by a single employee cannot be done in this new normal. 

Lack of manpower is also considered a contributing factor. 

They explained also that some of the DVs not submitted were 

cancelled checks. 

 

Management also promised that they will comply with the 

AT’s recommendation. During the Exit Conference, the OIC-

Director encouraged the Finance people to do better in 2021. 

RWO VII Financial statements were already submitted to the Office of 

the COA Auditor on March 22, 2021. The Accountant 

explained that this is the first time that financial statements 

were not submitted on time. This is due to the voluminous 

works brought by the pandemic. 

RWO  

VIII 

The Accountant reasoned that the delays in the submission of 

accounts were mainly due to the requirement that DVs be 

signed by the payees as acknowledgment of receipt of 

payment. Due to the pandemic, there had been a difficulty 

among their regular program beneficiaries in signing the DVs, 

hence the delays. 

RO XIII Management acknowledged the delay on the timely 

submission of the abovementioned DVs and RCD. It was a 

result of the overwhelming documents that need to be 

compiled to effect the completeness of supporting documents 

before submission to COA. The Management is fully aware of 

the consequence on not having submitted the said reports on 

time and will affect the immediate submission of said 

documents the soonest. The Management pledged timely 

schedule of upcoming submission of reports within the 

prescribed period. 

 

Auditors’ Rejoinder 

 

13.11. The Auditors’ Rejoinder follows: 
 

Office Auditor’s Rejoinder 

RWO 

IV-A 

The Year-end FS were only submitted on April 6, 2021, the day 

of the Exit Conference, which hindered the AT‘s early detection 

and corrections of error/deficiencies. The AT continuously 

reminded the Management to comply with the recommendations 



118 

 

Office Auditor’s Rejoinder 

of the AT. 
 

The submitted DVs together with the supporting documents as 

well as the Liquidation Reports are under post-audit by the AT. 

Monitoring of the complete submission of the DVs and 

Liquidation Reports will be made. 

RWO V The AT reiterated during the Exit Conference to submit 

immediately the unsubmitted DVs, otherwise the transactions 

would be subjected to suspensions. 

 

The AT also suggested the re-orientation of the AU on the 

reports to be submitted and deadlines to meet. It was emphasized 

also that the lack of personnel in the Finance Unit is one of the 

factors contributory to the late submission. 

 

Further, proper supervision should be done by the Accountant 

and the Cashier- Designate of the JOs performing the job. Proper 

orientation also of the JOs on the deadlines of the chores 

assigned to them should be conducted. 

 

 

Accounts not updated to conform to the RCA (Updated)  

 

14. Accounts in the Trial Balance of CO, RWO-CAR, I and VI were not in

PROGRAM EVALUATION 

 

Implementation of Balik Pinas Balik Hanapbuhay (BPBH) Program 

 

15. For the implementation of the Balik Pinas Balik Hanapbuhay (BPBH) 
Program, ₱30,265,000.00 or 95.85 percent of the total budget of ₱31,575,000.00 

for the period January to December 2020 was released by RWO NCR for 

repatriated/displaced/ distressed 1,769 member-OFW beneficiaries. However, 

inadequate monitoring of the sustainability and viability of the livelihood 

projects undertaken by recipients was observed, as out of the 1,769 recipients, 

only 160 or 9.04 percent were selected for monitoring by RWO NCR, of which, 

only 69 or 3.90 percent responded to the Management’s validation, with the 

BPBH Program Monitoring Report (BPBH-MR) not submitted to the Audit 

Team, contrary to paragraph VI of Memorandum of Instruction (MOI) No. 

005, Series of 2017. 

 

15.1. The BPBH Program is a package of livelihood support/ assistance intended 
to provide immediate relief to returning member-OFWs, active or non-active 

who were: a) displaced from their jobs due to wars/ political conflicts in host 



121 

 

countries, or policy reform controls and changes by the host government; 

b) victims of illegal recruitment and/or human trafficking or other distressful 

situations; c) distressed wards at the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipino 

Resource Centers who are due for repatriation; and d) repatriated OWWA-

members who were employed by foreign employers which are beset with 

financial difficulties due to economic conditions. This was implemented by 

the OWWA through issuance of Memorandum of Instruction (MOI) No. 7, 

Series of 2013 and subsequent amendments. 

 

15.2. The BPBH livelihood package is composed of: 
 

a. Cash assistance of up to a maximum amount of Twenty Thousand Pesos 
(₱20,000.00) as start-up or additional capital for livelihood project; 

b. Entrepreneurship Development Training; and 
c. Other services that will enable the target beneficiaries to start/manage a 

livelihood undertaking through self-employment, such as provision of 

marketing linkages and job referral. 

 

15.3. In addition, paragraph VI of MOI No. 005, Series of 2017 provides the 
following on monitoring and evaluation of BPBH program implementation: 

 
Initial monitoring shall be done a month after the release of the 

assistance/ grant to ensure that the projects are implemented. 

Thereafter, the RWOs shall monitor all approved livelihood 

projects every six (6) months to ensure that projects are 

implemented accordingly to the business plan/ proposal, and 

identify other interventions to help sustain the operation of the 

project. (Emphasis supplied) 

 

15.4. For CY 2020, OWWA RWO-NCR had an approved budget of 
₱40,000,000.00. It received a total amount of ₱31,575,000.00 from the 

OWWA-Central Office (CO) for the implementation of the Program, as 

follows:

Total  31,575,000.00 

 

15.5. Out of this amount, a total of ₱30,265,000.00 or 95.85% was released to 
program beneficiaries, thereby extending immediate relief to 

repatriated/displaced/ distressed 1,769 member-OFW beneficiaries for the 



122 

 

period January to December 2020 with amounts ranging from ₱5,000 to 

₱20,000.00 each. The details are shown below:

Total 30,265,000.00 1,769 

 

15.6. The MOI provides, among others, that Management should conduct 
monitoring after a month of the release of the grant and six months 

thereafter, to ensure that projects are implemented accordingly to the 

business plan. However, due to the rapid spread of the COVID-19, 

performing site inspections to the BPBP Program beneficiaries is not ideal, 

thus conducting phone call interviews and Short Messaging Services (SMS) 

would suffice.  

 

15.7. Management failed to provide the BPBH-MR to the AT, instead provided 
the narrative report on the said program. The information in the BPBH-MR 

is necessary in determining compliance with the requirements of the MOI 

and monitoring of the projects if the goal and objectives of the program are 

satisfactorily achieved. 

 

15.8. Based on the narrative report on the BPBH Program submitted on April 06, 
2021, 160 OFW-beneficiaries from January to November 2020 were 

randomly selected for the conduct of business monitoring or only 9.04 

percent of the total 1,769 beneficiaries. Out of which, only 69 or 3.90 

percent responded to the Management’s validation, details as follows:

15.9. The submitted narrative report noted that out of the selected 160 
respondents, only 69 or 43 percent responded to the phone call interviews 

while the remaining 91 or 57 percent did not respond to the calls/text 

messages for the conduct of livelihood monitoring. 

 

15.10. Result of the business monitoring for the 69 respondents as provided on the 
submitted narrative report were as follows: 

 

Status of the Business 
No. of 

Respondents 

Sustained their original livelihood projects. 32 

Shifted to another type of business. 5 

Unable to sustain their businesses due to several reasons such as low 

income, low customer volume, and safety concerns in presumption 

to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. 22 

Did not initiate their proposed livelihood projects instead used the 

grant for settling personal debts and purchasing basic necessities. 3 

Already moved and established their business in the province instead 

of the place of business in their approved applications. 5 

Returned abroad however the business are currently managed by 

relatives 2 

Total 69 

 

15.11. The AT, however, was not able to conduct site inspections on the approved 
proposals and one-to-one interview with the program beneficiaries for 

validation due to the implementation of the minimum safety health protocols 

and Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) due to the COVID-19 

pandemic. 

 

15.12. In view of the foregoing, the validity of the disbursements could not be 
ascertained due to non-submission of the BPBH-MR and the limited and/or 

absence of site inspections and interviews.  

 

15.13. We commended the Management’s effort in extending immediate relief 
to repatriated/displaced/distressed 1,769 member-OFW beneficiaries by 

releasing funds as budgeted and planned despite the ongoing COVID-19 

pandemic and recommended to continue the same effort in the 

implementation of the BPBH program.  

  

15.14. However, we recommended that Management require the concerned 
Overseas Workers Welfare Officer of the Programs Services Unit to: 

 

a) conduct monitoring/validation of the livelihood projects 
undertaken by the beneficiaries of the Program to ensure that the 

projects are implemented accordingly, as provided by paragraph 



124 

 

VI of the MOI No. 005, Series of 2017 and render a report thereon; 

and 

 

b) submit the BPBH-MR to the Audit Team. 
 

15.15. The Management of RWO NCR explained that the conduct of monitoring/ 
validation of the program was undertaken through phone calls and Short 

Messaging Services (SMS) in order to comply with the minimum health 

protocols and in order to avoid the spread of the COVID-19, thus resulting in 

low response rate of the displaced beneficiaries. 

 

Deficiencies in the implementation of the Welfare Calamity Assistance (WAP) 

 

16. Inadequacy in the implementation of the WAP raised doubts on the actual 
receipt of financial assistance by the program beneficiaries or the OWWA 

members and their families affected by natural calamities due to: (a) release of 

funds in RWO V through cash advances to the official who is not a designated 

Disbursing Officer nor the one who actually disbursed/distributed the funds to 

the beneficiaries; and (b) incomplete and doubtful information on claim forms 

in RWO XI, contrary to the OWWA MOI No. 011, Series of 2018, Items 3.2, 

4.1.5, 4.1.6, and 8 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 and 

Sections 2, 4, 123 and 124 of PD No. 1445. 

 

16.1. COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides the Rules and 
Regulations on the Granting, Utilization and Liquidation of Cash Advances. 

The pertinent provisions of the Circular, are: 

 

Item 3.2 – Special cash advances are those granted on the explicit 

authority of the Head of the Agency only to duly 

designated disbursing officers or employees for other 

legally authorized purposes. 

 

Item 4.1.5 – Only duly appointed or designated disbursing officers may 

perform disbursing functions…xxx. 

 

Item 4.1.6 – Transfer of cash advance from one Accountable Officer to 

another shall not be allowed. 

  

Item 8 – It shall be the responsibility of the Head of the Agency to 

ensure the proper granting, utilization and liquidation of all 

cash advances in accordance with these rules and 

regulations. 

 

16.2. Section 2 of PD No. 1445 provides that “It is the declared policy of the State 
that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized 

in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or 



125 

 

wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring 

efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The 

responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests 

directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.” 

 

16.3. Item 6, Section 4 of the PD No. 1445 states that: “Claims against 
government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.” 

 

16.4. Sections 123 and 124 of the same PD also provide: 
 

 Section 123.Definition of internal control. Internal control is the plan 
of organization and all the coordinate methods and measures adopted 

within an organization or agency to safeguard its assets, check the 

accuracy and reliability of its accounting data, and encourage adherence 

to prescribed managerial policies. 

 

 Section 124.Installation. It shall be the direct responsibility of the 
agency head to install, implement, and monitor a sound system of 

internal control. 

 

16.5. The OWWA issued MOI No. 011, Series of 2018, pertaining to Amendatory 
Guidelines on the Implementation of the WAP. It partially provides the 

following: 

 
I. Nature and Objective: 
 

The WAP is an assistance extended to OWWA members, active or non- active, 

and/or their families, who are not eligible under any of the existing OWWA social 

benefit programs. It seeks to provide cash relief assistance to OWWA members 

and/or their families, whether at the jobsite or in country, among others, (a) 

calamity assistance for OWWA members and/or their families affected by natural 

or human-induced disasters/calamities

2.  The OFW has paid at least one (1) OWWA membership contribution. 

3.  The WAP can only be availed of once except for: 

a. calamity assistance where an OFW-member can have multiple availments 
but only up to the prescribed maximum benefit/ assistance; xxx 

4. Reckoning period for entitlement to claims is the date of filing of 

application/claim. In the event that a claimant dies while the claim is in-process 

or in the pipeline, the eligible beneficiary may still receive the claim. 

 

IV. Documentary Requirements 
 

Applicant-OFW or family member shall submit required documents per category to 

OWWA RWOs, as follows:

 Next-of-kin (NOK) 

 



127 

 

16.6. Audit revealed the following deficiencies in the implementation of the WAP: 
 

a. CAs and liquidations of the SDOs for CY 2020 in RO V disclosed that 
there were CAs drawn by the OIC-Regional Director (RD) totaling 

₱2,499,000.00 for payment of the WAP to OWWA members and their 

families affected by typhoons. Details of the CAs are summarized 

below: 

 

Date Granted Check No. Purpose

December 1, 2020 2471980 999,000.00  

Total  2,499,000.00  

 

(a) The drawing of CA by the RD weakens the internal control on the 
granting, utilization and liquidation of CA, particularly the check and 

balance as there is no other officer to check the proper disposition 

thereof. The RD, being the person vested with the authority to grant 

the CA, and the responsibility to oversee the compliance to the rules 

and regulations pertaining to CAs. Further, his duties and 

responsibilities do not include the disbursing function and neither is 

he appointed or designated as disbursing officer; hence, he should not 

perform the disbursing function. 

 

(b) The magnitude of the duties and responsibilities of the RD will not 
permit him to make the payment of calamity assistance to affected 

OFW and their families. He will then resort to transferring the money 

to other OWWA RWO V employees who will actually make the 

payment, which is not allowed under existing regulations. 

 

(c) The payment of calamity assistance through a remittance provider is 
more economical and safer than paying through a CA. The Agency 

will only incur a minimal cost of ₱20.00 as service fee for payment to 

each beneficiary, while more administrative costs will be incurred, 

like gasoline/fuel, rental of transportation vehicle and the paid man-

hours, during the payout through the CA, not mentioning the risk 

involved while transporting such huge amount of money from the 

Regional office to the designated pay out area. 

 

(d) Finally, the RD has also the responsibility to take care of the 
resources of the government and ensure that government funds shall 

be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and 

regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or 

improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy 

and effectiveness in the operations of government.  



128 

 

 

b. While in RWO XI, the Office in CY 2020 granted CAs to its personnel 
for the payment of financial assistance to various OFW-members or 

their Next-of-Kin (NOK) who are residents of areas greatly affected by 

the earthquake in CY 2019. Details are as follows:

(a) Scrutiny of some claim forms (CFs) attached to the LRs disclosed 
that these were not completely filled-out by the beneficiaries. There 

where instances where the: 

 

a. Date of receipt was not indicated; 
b. Date of receipt was prior to the date of the cash advance; 
c. Amount in words was not provided; 
d. The ink used to write the amount in figures is different from the 

one used to sign on the acknowledgment and declaration portion; 

e. Same penmanship for different beneficiaries; and 
f. Boxes provided for the certification of the beneficiary were not 

marked. 

 

(b) Interview with the WAP evaluator disclosed that a Family Welfare 
Officer assigned at the DOLE XI, Davao del Sur Field Office, 

spearheaded the identification of beneficiaries and received the 

applications from the OFW-members or their NOK, with the 

assistance of the Public Employment Service Office (PESO) 

personnel. These applications were brought to OWWA RWO- XI in 

Davao City for evaluation. Subsequently, CAs were granted to the 

Agency personnel for payout of financial assistance to the affected 

OFW-members or their NOK.  

 



129 

 

16.7. In view of the foregoing, the flawed implementation of the WAP given to 
OWWA and their families render questions on validity of the actual receipt 

of financial assistance by the program beneficiaries. 

 

16.8. We recommended that Management require the concerned Regions to: 
 

a. for RWO V, grant special CAs only to a duly appointed or 
designated Disbursing Officer or employee who may perform 

disbursing functions in accordance with Items 3.2 and 4.1.5 of COA 

Circular No. 97-002, dated February 10, 1997; and  

 

b. for RWO XI: 
 

 direct the officers concerned to submit their written explanations 
on the observations noted above; 

 

 devise procedures that will eliminate any doubts that may arise 
from particular transactions. We suggest that a separate form be 

used for the application requiring all the information needed for 

the evaluation, and the claim form will only be used upon the 

payment of financial assistance to ensure that it was filled-out by 

the beneficiary himself/herself and the actual date of receipt 

would then be after the grant of CA to the disbursing officer; 

and 

 

 ascertain that all government forms used to support claims of 
financial assistance are properly and completely filled-out. 

 

16.9. The Management commented as follows: 
 

Office/RWO Management Comments 

RWO V Management reasoned out that due to the outnumbered 

regular personnel of OWWA RWO-V and all are pre-

occupied and overloaded attending to the multifarious 

programs and are loaded also with CAs not yet liquidated, 

so in order not to hamper transactions of more importance, 

thus the OIC-Director draw cash advance for several 

times. 

 

But the Management will ensure compliance with the 

recommendation. Likewise, the OIC-Director stated 

during the Exit Conference that he will no longer draw 

cash advance. 

RWO XI Management submitted a letter dated March 19, 2021 

explaining in detail the circumstances faced by the 



130 

 

Office/RWO Management Comments 

beneficiaries and the Agency/government personnel who 

were responsible in the implementation of the WAP and 

why such issues raised in audit occurred. 

 

 

Audit of Foreign Posts 

 

17. In CY 2019, audit of foreign based government agencies (FBGAs) which include 
the OWWA Posts were conducted by special Audit Teams created by the COA 

Central Office. As of April 15, 2021, we received the Management Letters (MLs) 

containing the results of the audit conducted in 13 OWWA Posts in 1) Rome, Italy, 

2) Madrid, Spain, 3) Toronto, Canada, 4) Washington D.C., United States of 

America (USA), 5) Singapore, 6) Kaohsiung, Taiwan, 7) Taichung, Taiwan, 8) 

Macau-Special Autonomous Region, 10)Tel Aviv, Israel, 11) Jeddah, Kingdom of 

Saudi Arabia (KSA), 12) Al Khobar, KSA, Jordan, and 13) Tokyo, Japan. 

 

18. The MLs contain, among others, the results of the review of the adequacy of 
controls of the cash and property accountabilities of the AOs assigned thereat, 

evaluation of budgetary controls and monitoring of performance and 

accomplishments. The results of the audit of the different OWWA Posts are 

provided below: 

 

Cash Management and Accountability 

 

19. Membership contributions amounting to €16,550.05 collected by the former 
Welfare Officer (WelOf) of Rome, Italy, remained unremitted per record of 

OWWA–CO contrary to Section 64(O) of DOLE Administrative Order (AO) 

No. 168, Series of 2013. 

 

19.1. Section 64(O) of DOLE AO No. 168, Series of 2013, provides that “The 
Collecting Officer shall remit to the POEA, the OEC Collections and to the 

OWWA, the Membership Contributions, not later than the fifth day of the 

following month, through the banks designated by the POEA/OWWA Central 

Office.” (Emphasis supplied) 

 

19.2. Inquiry disclosed that the amount of €18,816.46 representing transfer of 
accountability of Cash in Bank by the former WelOf is still intact at the 

INTESO SAN PAOLO bank under the account name of Ambasciata Delle 

Filippine (Philippine Embassy) – OWWA, with Bank Account No. 1000-

00009302 using the Codice Fiscale (tax account code/number) of the 

Embassy, which is under the supervision of the Head of the Post. 

 

19.3. Audit of the Bank Statement confirmed that the €18,816.46 composed of 
€6,110.10 and €9,372.00 collections and €3,334.36 cash advances of the 

former WelOf were deposited in the above-named bank. As of November 6, 



131 

 

2019, the account has a balance of €15,752.60 and bank charges totaling 

€229.72 which were imposed by the bank to the OWWA.  

 

19.4. It was noted, however, that there still exists an unreconciled balance of 
€1,067.95 between the records of the OWWA–Rome and OWWA–CO 

unremitted collections of the predecessor of the incumbent WelOf, as 

presented in the table.

19.5. It was recommended that the WelOf –  
 

a. request from the Philippine Embassy (PE)-Rome, through the 
Ambassador, being the signatory of the bank account, for the (i) 

transfer/remittance of the amount of €18,816.46 to OWWA – CO 

through the OWWA LBP account in the Philippines in accordance 

with Section 64 (O) of DOLE AO No. 168 series of 2013; and (ii) 

closure of the bank account maintained by the PE–Rome for 

OWWA to avoid the incurrence of additional bank charges; 

 

b. cause the opening of a new account for OWWA, in coordination 
with the PE-Rome and OWWA – Milan, pursuant to Section V.A 

(2) of AO No. 90 and Section 61.A of AO No. 168 series of 2013; and  

 

c. cause the reconciliation of the difference of €1,067.95. 
 

19.6. During the Exit Conference, the Philippine Ambassador in Rome informed 
that they were able to secure a Codice Fiscale for OWWA thru the efforts of 

the Embassy’s Administrative Officer and relayed that the PE-Rome will 

assist the WelOf in facilitating the opening of a new account for OWWA, as 

well as in remitting the unremitted collections of €18,816.46 to OWWA-CO 

through the OWWA LBP account in the Philippines. 
. 

20. Cash collections of the WelOfs of Rome, Italy, Singapore, Madrid, Spain, 
Jeddah, KSA, Washington D.C., USA were not deposited intact on the next 

banking day and deposits were delayed ranging from seven to 103 days 

contrary to Section 69 of PD No. 1445, COA Circular No. 97-002 dated 



132 

 

February 10, 1997, OWWA MOI No. 003 series of 2008 and Section 64b of 

DOLE AO No. 168, Series of 2013. 

 

20.1. Section 69 of PD No. 1445 states that: “Public officers authorized to receive 
and collect moneys arising from taxes, revenues, or receipts of any kind 

shall remit or deposit intact the full amounts so received and collected by 

them to the treasury of the agency concerned and credited to the particular 

accounts to which the said moneys belong…” 

 

20.2. Likewise, COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 states that all 
collecting officers shall deposit intact all their collections, as well as 

collections turned over to them by sub-collectors/tellers, with Authorized 

Government Depository Bank (AGDB) daily, or not later than the next 

banking day. 

 

20.3. OWWA MOI No. 003 series of 2008 provides that on-site membership 
collections could be deposited daily and remitted monthly to the OWWA 

dollar accounts. 

 

20.4. Sections 64(M) and 64(O) of DOLE AO No. 168, Series of 2013, provide as 
follows: 

 

M. Deposit of collection shall not be later than the following banking 

day unless otherwise authorized in writing by the OWWA 

Administrator to deposit it on a weekly/semi-monthly/monthly 

basis for justifiable reason/s such as very small amount of daily 

collections, there is a bank charges for each deposit, or other 

valid reasons subject to COA rules. 

 

O. The Collecting Officer shall remit to the POEA, the OEC 

collections and to the OWWA, the Membership Contributions, 

not later than the fifth day of the following month, through the 

banks designated by the POEA/OWWA CO. 

  

20.5. The results of audit disclosed that the collections of AOs in five OWWA 
Posts were not deposited intact on the next banking day, contrary to the 

aforementioned rules and regulations, as shown in the table below:  

 

Posts Amount No. of days delay 

Rome, Italy €115,044.05 61 to 103 

Singapore USD20,867 7 to 56 

Madrid, Spain $2, 910.40 and €177.20 27 to 30 

Jeddah, KSA SAR2,718,762.00 One to 35 

Washington D.C., USA $16,128.02 Not indicated  

 



133 

 

20.6. The collections of Singapore totaling USD20,867 pertain to receipt of 
membership fees in US dollars of OFWs in Cambodia and Indonesia during 

outreach missions. The Post in Singapore does not have a US Dollar account 

for depositing the membership fees of OFWs who pay in USD. Whenever 

the WelOf goes to the Philippines, she carries with her the USD collections 

and deposits the same to the OWWA LBP USD account. 

 

20.7. The delayed deposits of collections exposed the funds to the risk of 
misappropriation or possible misuse or lose through theft/robbery. 

 

20.8. It was recommended that: 
 

a. the WelOfs of Madrid and Washington D.C. to comply strictly with 
the aforementioned regulations in depositing their collections, which 

the WelOfs agreed;  

 

b. the AO of Singapore to convert USD collections in Singapore dollars 
and immediately remit them just like any SGD collections or remit 

the same in USD; and 

 

c. the WelOf of Rome to comply with the provisions of Section 64(M) 
and (O) of DOLE AO No. 168 on the frequency of the deposit of daily 

collections to the authorized bank and the remittance of said 

collections to OWWA-CO. 

 

20.9. During the Exit Conference, the Labor Attaché of Singapore suggested that 
they be deposited/remitted in USD subject to applicable bank charges. 

 

21. Funds for Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) and Program 
Funds of the OWWA Posts in Jordan and Tokyo, Japan amounting to 

USD123,100.00 and USD28,597.86, respectively, were deposited under the 

personal Savings Account of the respective WelOfs instead of in the name of 

the OWWA, which is not in conformity with sound internal control principle 

which prohibits the co-mingling of public funds with personal funds, thereby 

exposing public funds from risk or misuse and rendering difficulty in 

accounting thereof. 

 

21.1. One of the basic internal control principles on the handling and custody of 
cash requires the segregation of public from personal funds to ensure that 

government funds are rightfully accounted for as public funds and are not 

co-mingled with private funds and that such public funds are spent and 

utilized only for public purposes. 

 

21.2. Audit disclosed that the MOOE, Program Fund and service fees for the local 
hires totaling USD123,100.00 or JOD87,401 and USD28,597.86 or 

¥3,106,036 were credited to the personal account of the WelOfs of Jordan 



134 

 

and Tokyo, respectively. This practice showed that the Agency funds are co-

mingled with the personal funds of the WelOfs. This condition exposes 

government funds to the risk of being spent for personal purposes and 

rendered it difficult to make a proper accounting of the OWWA funds as the 

balance of the account is composed of both the personal and OWWA funds. 

 

21.3. Inquiry disclosed that only the Philippine Embassy (PE) is authorized under 
Jordan Central Bank regulations to open an account for the Philippine 

Government. However, per inquiry made by the Finance Officer of the 

Philippine Embassy with its depository bank in Amman, Jordan, it was 

informed that the OWWA may open a sub-account under the Embassy’s 

account maintained with Arab Jordan Investment Bank (AJIB).  

 

21.4. It was recommended that the: 
 

a. WelOf of Jordan (and he agreed) to coordinate with the Finance 
Officer of the PE for the opening of a sub-account under the 

Embassy’s account with AJIB and consequently facilitate the 

immediate transfer of all balances of the MOOE and Program 

Funds for proper accounting and verification of the funds; and  
 

b. WelOf of Tokyo 
 

i) to request the OWWA-CO to refrain from transferring funds 
other than her salaries and allowances to her personal account, 

and instead make fund transfers to the appropriate bank 

accounts of the Post; and 

 

ii) to immediately transfer the cash advance inadvertently credited 
to her personal account to the correct fund bank account for an 

efficient cash management. 
 

21.5. The Post commented that the OWWA, together with the Philippine Overseas 
Labor Office (POLO) in Jordan, has taken steps to open a separate account 

at the Arab Bank and is presently awaiting approval of the Embassy’s 

request (through a Note Verbale) by the Jordan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 

which is a bank pre-requisite for the opening of a government or corporate 

account. 

 

21.6. For the Post in Tokyo, it was informed that a Memorandum dated August 
22, 2019 was already sent by the AO to the OWWA-CO. 

 

21.7. CO requested that funds for MOOE and Program Funds be deposited 
separately to its corresponding bank accounts maintained with the PNB – 

Tokyo Branch. 

  



135 

 

22. Examination of the cash and cash accountabilities of the AOs of Al Khobar 
Post showed an overage of US$1,142.22 or ₱58,056.02, which indicates the co-

mingling of personal funds of AOs with the Post’s funds and inadequate 

adoption of control monitoring activities. 

 

22.1. Sound internal control dictates that AOs shall keep personal monies separate 
and distinct from government funds in their custody or otherwise apply the 

same to any use not authorized by law or ordinance. 

 

22.2. Results of cash examination revealed that the AOs have incurred over-
expenditures in their cash advances amounting to US$1,142.22 or 

₱58,056.02. 

 

22.3. We recommended that the AOs separate their personal funds from the 
government funds in their custody and strictly monitor the utilization 

and liquidation of cash advances by the proper maintenance of cash 

disbursement records/registers. 

  

22.4. The AOs admitted the incurrence of over-expenditures which are indeed 
valid transactions and the lapses in the monitoring that could not be avoided 

due to its current organizational structure and limited personnel that require 

them to take multi-tasking responsibilities. Further, the AOs emphasized that 

providing social and welfare services to OFWs require much of their time in 

performing fieldwork, thus they find it difficult to stay in the office to 

prepare the documents for the liquidation of their cash advances. 

 

23. The OWWA Post in Toronto, Canada does not maintain a depository account 
for its collections, contrary to Section 21 of the Manual on the New 

Government Accounting System (MNGAS) for NGAs Volume I, thereby 

exposing the funds to the risk of loss or misappropriation. 

 

23.1. Section 21 of the MNGAS for NGAs, Volume I provides that all Collecting 
Officers shall deposit intact all their collections to an Authorized 

Government Depository Bank (AGDB) daily or not later that the next 

banking day. 

 

23.2. Audit of the cash accountabilities of the Collecting Officer disclosed that her 
collections were only kept in the cash vault until the same are remitted to the 

OWWA-CO as no bank depository account is being maintained by the Post. 

This condition is not in line with the principle of good stewardship in 

keeping government funds, thus exposes the funds to the risk of loss or 

misappropriation.  

  



136 

 

23.3. It was recommended, and the WelOf agreed, to open and maintain a 
bank account which will serve as depository accounts for all collections 

to safeguard the cash collections from any risk or loss or 

misappropriation. 

 

24. Handling of CAs by the concerned official of Kaohsiung, Taiwan disclosed the 
use in CY 2019 of CY 2018 CAs of US$1,171.42 instead of liquidating the same 

and incurrence of expenditures in excess of CAs, contrary to the pertinent 

provisions of DOLE AO No. 190 Series of 2012. 
 

24.1. Items V.C.4, V.C.5 and V.C.9 of DOLE AO No. 190, Series of 2012 dated 
June 4, 2012 provides as follows: 

 

Item V.C.4: Labatt/WelOf shall not incur/authorize expenditures 

in excess of the total allocated budget, unless there is prior 

authority from the Central Office (CO).Said officers responsible 

for the incurrence of overdrafts shall be held personally liable 

thereof. 

 

Item V.C.5: The cash advance for a particular year cannot be used 

to pay expenses for the following year unless specifically 

authorized in writing by the Central Office and subject to 

accounting and auditing rules. 

 

Item V.C.9: All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end 

of the year or not later than 20 of January of the following year; 

otherwise, the salary of the Labor Attaché and/or the WelOf, as 

the case may be, shall be withheld, without prejudice to possible 

withholding of all other entitlements and to the imposition of 

other disciplinary measures. x xx. 

 

24.2. Review of the CAs for Program Fund received on July 22, 2018 in the 
amount of US$13,500, or NT$413,761.50 disclosed that it was not fully 

liquidated by January 20, 2019, instead, the unliquidated balance of 

US$1,171.42, or NT$35,902.85 was carried over and expended in the 

ensuing year (2019). Moreover, the expenditures incurred during CY 2019 

for Program Fund exceeded the total CAs for the same year in the total 

amount of US$27,600.00 or NT$851,224.54 by US$4,108.08 or NT$ 

126,969.64.These situations are contrary to the aforementioned Items V.C.4, 

V.C.4 and V.C.9 of DOLE AO No. 190 Series of 2012. 

 

24.3. It was recommended that the concerned official of the Kaohsiung, 
Taiwan Post adhere to the above cited provisions of DOLE AO No. 190, 

Series of 2012, particularly on the full liquidation of the CAs at the end 

of each year or up to January 20 of the following year and to refrain 

from paying expenses of the ensuing year with prior year’s CAs.  



137 

 

 

24.4. The concerned official explained that they were granted authority to deduct 
from the succeeding CA in 2019 the unliquidated amount of US$1,171.42, 

or NT$35,902.85 from his previous CA in 2018. As to the incurrence of 

overdraft, the same official informed that funds for CY 2019 were received 

only in March 2019.Since all programs for the OFWs are pre-planned for the 

rest of the year with specified budget, they have to push through with the 

scheduled trainings and activities, even if it meant shelling out his personal 

money.  

 

24.5. The Audit Team stated that they were not furnished with a written authority 
from the OWWA-CO to deduct the unliquidated CY 2018 CA of 

US$1,171.42 from CY 2019 CA despite verbal request thereof. 

 

25. The accountability reports of the former WelOf of Madrid, Spain were not 
properly turned over to the incumbent WelOf, contrary to Section 77 of PD No. 

1445. 

 

25.1. Section 77 of PD No. 1445, states as follows: 
 

Section 77. Invoice and receipt upon transfer of funds or 

property. When government funds or property are transferred from 

one accountable officer to another, or from an outgoing officer to his 

successor, it shall be done upon properly itemized invoice and 

receipt which shall invariably support the clearance to be issued to 

the relieved or outgoing officer, subject to regulations of the 

Commission. 

 

25.2. The financial reports, disbursement records and supporting documents in 
possession of the former WelOf were not turned over to the incumbent 

WelOf thus the accountability of the previous WelOf for the period August 

8, 2017 to July 29, 2019 could not be established due to the absence of these 

reports/documents. 

 

25.3. It was recommended that: 
 

a. the incumbent WelOf inform the OWWA-CO about the non-
availability of the financial records at the Madrid, Spain Post; and 

 

b. request to the OWWA-CO to order the former WelOf to turn over 
her accountability reports to her successor WelOf pursuant to 

Section 77 of PD No. 1445. 

  



138 

 

26. The Fidelity Bond relative to the accountability of the AOs at the Posts of Tel 
Aviv, Israel, Singapore and Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) were not 

sufficient to cover the maximum amount of their cash accountabilities, 

contrary to Item 5.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009. 

 

26.1. Section 101 (2), Chapter 5 of PD No. 1445 states that “Every accountable 
officer shall be properly bonded in accordance with law.” Likewise, Section 

5.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 explains that the amount of bond shall 

be based on the total accountability of the AO as determined by the head of 

the agency.

26.2. It was recommended, and the respective WelOfs of Tel Aviv, Singapore 
and Jeddah agreed, to request to the OWWA-CO for the increase of the 

fidelity bonds of their respective AOs to adequately cover their 

maximum accountability. 

 

27. Internal control lapses were noted in the handling of cash and accounts of the 
AOs in 13 Posts, contrary to pertinent provisions of PD No. 1445, GAM for 

NGAs, Volume I, Revised Cash Examination Manual (RCEM) and COA

2018, June 2019 and July 2019 were not submitted. 

Validation from the records of the Post showed, 

however, that the reports were already sent to OWWA-

CO through Federal Express except for the report for 

the month of April 2018 which was not delivered yet by 

FedEx. 

 Errors were also noted in the preparation of the 
CRR/ROC. 

 

28.5. It was recommended and the: 
 

a. WelOf of Singapore, Rome, Italy, Tel Aviv and Washington D.C. 
Posts agreed to prepare the CRReg (Appendix 27) of the GAM for 

NGAs, Volume I;  

 

b. WelOf of Washington D.C. Post agreed to coordinate with the 
courier to trace the undelivered report and require for the immediate 

delivery to OWWA-CO and to submit a revised reports to correct 

the erroneous reports and henceforth, ensure the accurate 

preparation of the CRReg. 

 

 

Property Management 

 

29. All reported PPEs of the Posts in Rome, Italy, Jordan and Madrid and Spain 
are existing and all serviceable properties are properly maintained and 

accounted for. However, several undetermined items below the capitalization 

threshold of ₱15,000.00 which are appropriately classified as semi-expendable 

properties were recorded as PPEs in Jeddah, KSA, Tokyo, Japan and Macau, 

SAR Posts.  

 

29.1. Section 10, Chapter 8, GAM for NGAs, Volume I state as follows: 
 

Tangible items below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 

shall be accounted as semi-expendable property. The following 

policies apply as follows: 

 

a. Semi-expendable property which were recognized as PPE shall 

be reclassified to the affected accounts. 

 

b. These tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon issue 

to the end-user. 

  



145 

 

29.2. Audit revealed that several items below the capitalization threshold of 
₱15,000.00 which are to be classified as semi-expendable items were 

reported in the RPCPE of Jeddah, KSA and Tokyo, Japan Posts.  

  

29.3. It was recommended, and Management agreed, to: 
 

Jeddah, KSA 

 
a. require the Property Officer of the Post to prepare a separate report on 

semi-expendable properties for the PPE below the threshold of 

₱15,000.00; and 

 

b. require the Accountant to record the issuance of semi-expendable 
properties as Expenses. 

 

Tokyo, Japan 

 
c. require the Post to comply with Section 10, Chapter 8 and Appendix 66, 

Volumes I and II, respectively, of the GAM for NGAs on the proper 

reporting of PPE and semi-expendable assets. The supplies or property 

with unit values below the P15,000.00 threshold must be removed from 

the RPCPPE and reported in a separate RPCI. 

 

Macau 

 
d. Reclassify the recording of various semi-expendable properties from PPE 

to Semi-expendable Properties account and henceforth record the same in 

the RPCI. 

 

Obsolete Properties 

 

30. Deficiencies were noted in the handling of obsolete and unserviceable 
properties in OWWA Posts at a) Washington D.C., USA, b) Kaohsiung, 

Taiwan, c) Jordan, and d) Jeddah, KSA, contrary to the provisions of Section 

79 of PD No. 1445, Section 68 of DOLE AO No. 168 series of 2013, and Section 

42(h) of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

30.1. Section 79 of PD No. 1445 states as follows: 
 

Section 79. Destruction or sale of unserviceable property. 

When government property has become unserviceable for any 

cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the 

officer accountable therefor, be inspected by the head of the 

agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of 

the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, 

it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it 

may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the 

supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in 



146 

 

the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized 

representative of the Commission, after advertising by printed 

notice in the Official Gazette, or for not less than three 

consecutive days in any newspaper of general circulation, or 

where the value of the property does not warrant the expense of 

publication, by notices posted for a like period in at least three 

public places in the locality where the property is to be sold. In 

the event that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at 

a private sale at such price as may be fixed by the same 

committee or body concerned and approved by the Commission. 

 

30.2. Section 68 of DOLE AO No. 168 series of 2013 provides that the POLO 
shall request clearance from the CO (Attention: The Disposal Committee) to 

dispose any unserviceable equipment and property subject to COA rules, 

using the IIRUP. 

 

30.3. Section 42(h) of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that Inventory and 
Inspection Report for Unserviceable Property (Appendix 74) shall be used to 

account for all unserviceable property of an entity which is subject to 

disposal. It also serves as the basis in derecognizing the unserviceable 

properties carried in the PPE accounts. 

 

30.4. The results of audit in four OWWA Posts are as follows: 
 

Post Amount Deficiencies 

Washington 

D.C., USA 

US$388.59 Unserviceable property not disposed of, 

thus, unnecessarily occupying space and 

exposing them to further deterioration 

and decreased salvage value. 

Kaohsiung, 

Taiwan 

NT$104,032.00 

or ₱154,366.94 

Unserviceable properties not listed in 

the IIRUP and no action so far was 

initiated by the concerned official to 

dispose the same contrary to Section 

42,Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I. 

Jordan Not indicated Unserviceable and obsolete properties 

of undetermined amount have not been 

disposed of thereby resulting in their 

continued deterioration. Moreover, these 

undisposed properties remain under the 

accountability of the Property Officer 

despite being damaged, worthless or 

lost. 

Jeddah, KSA ₱25,437.50 Unserviceable properties amounting to 

₱25,437.50 were still included in the 

RPCPPE. 



147 

 

 

30.5. It was recommended, and the concerned WelOfs agreed, to: 
 

Washington D.C., USA 

 

a. request clearance from OWWA-CO through the POLO to dispose 
the unserviceable equipment; 

 

Kaohsiung, Taiwan 

 

b. initiate the necessary action/s towards the disposal of the identified 
unserviceable items amounting to NT$104,032.00 or ₱154,366.94 the 

soonest possible time; 

 

Jordan 

 

c. instruct the Property Officer to facilitate the disposal of all 
unserviceable properties 

 

Jeddah, KSA 

 

d. require the Property Officer to: i) prepare a separate report on semi-
expendable properties for the PPE below the threshold of 

₱15,000.00; ii) report unserviceable properties in the IIRUP for 

dropping from the PPE accounts and for the reclassification and 

recording to the Other Assets account; and iii) properly monitor the 

ICS; and 

 

e. require the Accountant to record the issuance of semi-expendable 
properties as Expenses. 

 

31. Lapses were noted in the handling of property and equipment in two OWWA 
Posts 

 

Kaohsiung, Taiwan 

 

31.1. Training equipment particularly those for Photography, in the total 
amount of NT$25,800 or ₱42,673.20 were not properly safeguarded 

from possible loss, misuse and deterioration contrary to sound property 

management. 
 

31.1.1. We noted during the physical inventory that training equipment for 
Photography amounting to NT$25,800 or ₱42,673.20 were not 

properly safeguarded from possible loss, misuse and deterioration 

considering that the said items were just placed under the table 

inside the office and were not stored in a locked storage accessible 



148 

 

only to the property custodian. Sound property management 

dictates that government properties should, at all times, be 

safeguarded against loss, misuse, theft deterioration and other 

irregularities. 

 

31.1.2. It was recommended that the concerned official instruct the 
property custodian to store the above-mentioned photography 

equipment and other government properties in order to 

safeguard the same against loss, misuse, theft deterioration and 

other irregularities in accordance with sound property 

management. 

 

31.1.3. According to the concerned official, the training equipment used 
for Photography class was transferred to the stockroom within the 

office area. The Audit Team validated the said action. 

 

31.2. Several items of PPE composed of 20 units of Lenovo desktop 
computers and seven units of computer tables amounting 

NT$317,240.00 or ₱477,905.26, were not put into use and remained idle 

and just stored in a cabinet as of the date of the actual physical count. 

 

31.2.1. During the physical inventory conducted on October 14, 2019, we 
noted that the above-stated items of PPE were just kept in the 

storage area and were not being put into use resulting in 

unproductive utilization of government resources. Verbal inquiry 

disclosed that the said computers were intended for the 

Information Technology trainings of selected OFWs in Taiwan, 

which was implemented for a while but was later on aborted. The 

subject computers were never utilized and had been idle since then. 

 

31.2.2. It was recommended that the concerned official furnish the 
Audit Team with a written explanation/information on the 

plans/disposition of the above-stated idle desktop computers in 

the total amount of NT$317,240.00 or ₱477,905.26, to show 

that appropriate action/s shall be undertaken to put the same 

in productive use. 

 

31.2.3. The concerned official narrated the following situations, which 
explained why the subject computers became idle: 

 

 Funds for the Info Tech was received only on June 19, 2019 
after the Reintegration and Skills trainings were already 

scheduled; 

 



149 

 

 After the receipt of the fund, the supposed participants were 
immediately informed about the Info Tech training but they are 

no longer interested; 

 

 A group of caretakers wanted to join but backed out at the last 
minute due to difficulty in having a day-off; and 

 

 For CY 2020, the subject computers shall be utilized by the 
Photo-Editing Class sessions that will be offered to the 

graduates of Basic Photography training. 

 
Taichung, Taiwan 

 

31.3. Internal control on property management and custodianship was weak 
manifested by: (a) non-disclosure of property number in the report and 

non-preparation of ICS and PAR in the Post; and (b) absence of 

property number in the Inventory/List of Semi-Expendable Items as of 

December 31, 2018. 

 

31.3.1. We noted that the RPCPPE as of December 31, 2018 prepared by 
the Post did not indicate the property number, although the 

property has already been tagged or property numbers were 

already assigned/indicated in the property stickers. This resulted in 

difficulty in locating and matching the property during physical 

inventory. 

 

31.3.2. Chapter 10, Property, Plant and Equipment of GAM for NGAs, 
Volume I provide the following: 

 

Section 21.Issue of PPE. Based on approved RIS, the 

Supply and/or Property Custodian shall prepare the 

Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) (Appendix 

71) to support the issue of property to end-user. The 

PAR shall be renewed at least every three years or every 

time there is a change in accountability or custodianship 

of the property. 

 

31.3.3. Verification of the reports on file with the Post revealed that the 
following are not maintained, which is contrary to the aforecited 

provisions: 

 

1. PAR (Appendix 71) – This form shall be used by the 

Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to report the issuance 

of PPE and the acknowledgement of the end-user. 

 



150 

 

2. ICS (Appendix 59) – shall be prepared upon issue of semi-

expendable property covered by approved RIS. 

 

31.3.4. It was recommended, and the concerned official/employee 
agreed, to maintain the Inventory List/Report that indicate the 

Property Number and prepare the ICS and PAR for proper 

accountability and for monitoring and compliance with the 

aforecited provisions. 

  

Performance Evaluation 

 

32. Performance/Accomplishment report is considered as an integral part of the 
government’s accountability framework and reporting is the final stage of any 

activity. It is a form of measurement used by the Audit Team to evaluate if the 

OFWs have benefitted from the Programs/Activities/Projects (PAPs) implemented 

and/or undertaken by the Post. The Post also uses the report mainly to monitor and 

assess the extent of its accomplishments vis-á-vis the targets and to account the 

funds released to the Post. 

 
A. The ATs for the Posts in Macau, SAR and Madrid, Spain provided the following 

observations: 

 

Macau 

 

Labor Force Workers Services 

 

32.1. The Audit Teams noted impressive accomplishments of the Posts, but 
also observed programs and projects without target or with decreasing 

targets with no information on the reason thereon, thus better 

assessment of their performance could not be done.  

 

a. Training and Scholarship Grants 

 

The reported accomplishments on ITTP and its on-site participants for CYs 

2017 and 2018 have surpassed the targets by 62.07 percent and 36.46 

percent, respectively. While, the actual participants of the same program 

have decreased by 23.35 percent, from a target of 167 compared to the 

number of actual participants of 128 as of the end of the 2nd quarter of CY 

2019. 

  



151 

 

b. Labor Force Workers Services 

 

Workers Assistance and Repatriation Programs (WARPs) in CYs 2017 to 

2019 have no targets and were only based on the needs or requests made by 

OFWs, hence the evaluation of the same could not be qualified. 

 

c. Reintegration and Preparedness Program 

 

The accomplishments for the Reintegration Preparedness Program for CYs 

2017 and 2018 have increased tremendously, while target in CY 2018 was 

lower compared to the previous year due to incorrect computation on the 

number of participants who attended the training. 

 

d. Employment Regulations Services-Membership Registration and 

Promotion Services 

 

32.1.1. The actual accomplishments have exceeded the targets of the 
program in CYs 2017 and 2018 by 1,335 and 1,761, respectively. 

While the targets in CY 2019 have decreased by 3,000, its 

accomplishments from January to June 2019 of 9,207 have also 

surpassed their target by 1,207. 

 

32.1.2. It was recommended, and the WelOf agreed, to fill in the 
target column for WARP to be used as benchmark in attaining 

the desired results and to keep on implementing all the 

programs intended for the OFWs to ensure the safety and well-

being of their families. It was also advised for the Post to put 

remarks on all the programs that have decreasing targets to 

readily assess why the said circumstances/situation happened. 

 

32.1.3. Management commented that the decrease in number of activities 
was based on the corrected measures applied by the Post and 

recommendations of the previous Auditors. As of CY 2019, the 

Post has already adopted the recommendations of the previous 

Audit Team to count only the number of participants that attended 

the training instead of the number of sessions attended by the same 

participants. 

 

Madrid 

 

32.2. The accomplishment reports showed positively the increase of the number of 
clients served and the key stakeholders attended from its programs and 

activities. But the accomplishment report did not disclose the targeted 

activities for each activity impeding the team to substantiate performance. 

 



152 

 

33. Absence of complete data and amounts budgeted for CYs 2017 to 2018 
precluded the Audit Teams in the Posts of a) Washington D.C., USA,               

b) Singapore, c) Rome, Italy, d) Jordan, e) Tel Aviv, Israel, f) Al Khobar, KSA 

and g) Jeddah, KSA to review the targets and accomplishments for Fiscal 

Years (FYs) 2017 to 2019 of seven OWWA Overseas Posts.  

 

33.1. Section 10 of DOLE AO No. 168 series of 2013, dated April 30, 2013, 
provides that the POLO shall submit an Integrated Physical and Financial 

Plan (IPFP) detailing the Post’s target outputs for a specific fiscal year, 

indicating therein the numerical targets and output indicators accompanied 

by a detailed operational expenditure targets requirements, which shall be 

submitted every 15th day of December of the following year. 

 

33.2. Evaluation of the WFPs for FYs 2017 to 2019 of the Posts revealed the 
following deficiencies: 

 

33.2.1. Evaluation of the plans, targets and accomplishments of seven 
OWWA Posts for FYs 2017 to 2019 could not be done due to 

absence of complete data and amounts budgeted for CYs 2017 to 

2018. It was also noted that the respective reports of the Posts do 

not have performance indicators (PIs) to measure their 

accomplishments for a specific year. 

 

Post Deficiencies 

Washington 

D.C., USA 

The Post does not have complete available data for their 

targets and accomplishments, thus proper evaluation 

could not be made. Moreover, one activity for CY 2019 

does not have target but amount was provided as budget 

for the year. 

Singapore The targets for 11 program indicators were not fully 

accomplished with performance rates ranging from 25 

to 94 percent while in three PIs the accomplishments 

were much higher than the targets ranging from 159 to 

701 percent indicating that in target setting, not all 

factors have been considered to arrive at a reasonable 

and attainable target. 

Rome, Italy The Post’s performance could not be objectively 

assessed due to: (a) non-provision of work targets in the 

WFP for FYs 2017 and 2018; and (b) failure to indicate 

the 2019 targets in the WFP. Further, the 

activities/measures, targets and accomplishments in the 

WFP were not aligned with the OPCR.  

Jordan The accuracy of the reported accomplishments could 

not be validated due to inconsistencies/discrepancies of 

data/information pertaining to the same 

program/activity/project in the IPCR of the two 

WelOfs; OWWA WFP; and SPRS covering the 

calendar years 2017, 2018 and 2019 (as of October 31, 



153 

 

Post Deficiencies 

2019 only). 

Tel Aviv, 

Israel 

The accuracy of the reported accomplishment could not 

be established due to the absence of source documents 

and logbook or record of activities undertaken. 

Al Khobar, 

KSA 

Deficiencies in the documentation of Post’s reported 

accomplishments cast doubt on the accuracy and 

validity of the figures in the reports that would render 

the same unreliable due to: a) accomplishments on the 

number of cases solved under mediation appears to be 

unreliable; b) capacity building services were not 

broken down into trainings actually undertaken; c)the 

updated Master lists of Filipino Migrant Workers 

currently staying in the Host Country as at the date of 

the report was not filled-up; and d) there were no 

listings or documents in the Post to support all the 

figures in the Accomplishment Report.  

Jeddah, KSA a) The Post’s budget requirements for the year 2017 to 
2019 showed an increasing trend despite the failure 

of Management to set targets and commitments for 

the year, thus the target accomplishment cannot be 

verified as to the completion of the same. The 

accuracy of the reported accomplishment could not, 

however, be established due to the absence of 

source documents. The Post was not maintaining a 

logbook or records of activities undertaken based on 

the reported cases in the WelOf messenger accounts 

and thru the SMS. 

 

b) The efficiency and effectiveness on the 
implementation of the plans and programs of the 

Post cannot be determined due to absence of 

targeted activities in the Work and Financial Plan 

and records to validate the reported 

accomplishments. 

 

33.3. The respective ATs recommended, and the concerned WelOfs agreed, 
to: 

 

Washington D.C., USA 

 

a) provide complete reports including the budget allocated for each 
program of activities; and retain copies of the reports in their file; 

 

Jordan 

 

b) instruct process owners/staff preparing the reports to thoroughly 
check and verify data from the source and/or supporting 

documents/reports and see to it that accurate data are captured 



154 

 

consistently in the different reports being prepared and submitted 

by the OWWA in order to provide accurate and reliable data as 

input for decision-making; 

 

Jeddah, KSA 

 

c) provide the targets and baseline data for reference in determining 
the effectiveness in accomplishing its mandate; manage and utilize 

the budget allocation to implement the Post programs/projects and 

avoid under spending of fund releases for better services to  

distressed OFWs in the region; 
 

d) prepare the matrix of services for ready reference in the evaluation 
of the responsiveness of the Post; and  

 

e) ensure that the reported accomplishments of the Post tally with the 
reports submitted to oversight committees, particularly the 

Congress of the Philippines. 
 

b. Also, the respective ATs of Singapore, Rome, Tel Aviv and Al Khobar 
recommended that: 

 

Singapore 

 

f) in coordination with the POLO considers all factors and previous 
year’s accomplishment in target-setting to have a more realistic and 

attainable targets in all its performance indicators and avoid wide 

discrepancies between planned activities and accomplishment. It 

was also recommended that activities that cut across various 

indicators be reported in each indicator if they were considered in 

target setting; 

 

Rome 

 

g) ensure that the targets, accomplishments and performance 
indicators of the WFP are aligned with those of the OPCR. The 

activities/measures, targets, and accomplishment of the WFP should 

match with those presented in the OPCR, and the necessary 

adjustment and/or changes should be affected as the need arises due 

to justifiable reason/s; 

 

h) ensure that all targets are quantified in the WFP and OPCR based 
on prior year’s actual number of activities/outputs 

undertaken/produced plus adjustment/s as foreseeable; 
  



155 

 

Tel Aviv, Israel 
 

i) maintain or preserve all necessary documents supporting the 
accomplishments of its targeted performance which are vital for the 

validation thereof; and 

 

Al Khobar 
 

j) maintain records to support its accomplishments and to likewise 
review its target-setting to make its target realistic. 

 

 

Program Evaluation 

 

34. Several deficiencies were noted in the implementation of projects, programs 
and activities of OWWA Posts in Singapore, Jordan, Jeddah, K.S.A. and 

Washington D.C., U.S.A. 

 

34.1. Pertinent provisions of DOLE AO No. 168 series of 2013 are as follows: 
 

“Section 41 provides for the establishment of the Migrant 

Workers and Other Overseas Filipinos Resource Center 

(MWOFRC) in countries where there are large concentration of 

Filipinos. 

 

Section 45. Administration of the Center. The MWOFRC shall 

be under the direct control and supervision of the Head of the 

POLO. He/She shall keep the chief mission informed and 

updated on all matters affecting at least quarterly through a 

written report.” 

 

34.2. Review and evaluation of the projects, programs and activities of the four 
Posts disclosed the following: 

 

Post Deficiencies 

Singapore The needs of the OFWs in the Center were well-provided 

and on time and the programs implemented and services 

provided by the Post were responsive to the needs of the 

OFWs, however, the relocation of the Center may create a 

negative impact in the performance of the Post to better 

secure the OFWs, if not resolved immediately. 

Jeddah, KSA The effective implementation of the Programs of the Post 

for Overseas Filipinos (OFs) cannot be established due to 

the absence of source documents as Management failed to 

submit the required data on OFWs needing assistance. 

Jordan a) Payment of medical/illness assistance under the WAP 
Funds for two OFWs exceeded the limit as provided under 



156 

 

Post Deficiencies 
OWWA Memorandum of Instructions No. 01, s. 2018 by 

₱42,168.738. 

b) Payments made on 394 medical assistance amounting to 
JOD10,273.500 were not supported with complete 

documentation as required under OWWA MOI No. 01, s. 

2018 and Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445. 

Washington 

D.C., USA 

1. The Post does not have reliable data to validate the 
attainment of programs as targeted. The program for 

Community Outreach for CY 2019 does not have target 

for CY 2019 but budget in the amount of $16,800.00 

(₱848,400.00) was provided per WFP. 

 

34.3. The AT recommended that the OWWA Singapore Post make 
representation with the Urban Redevelopment Authority to allow the 

Post to lease a place that is conducive for the implementation of 

POLO/OWWA programs that will upgrade the skills of the OFWs 

housed in the Center; and  

 

34.4. The respective ATs recommended and the concerned WelOfs agreed to: 
 

Jordan 

 

a) evaluate the eligibility of the OFWs requesting medical assistance 
using the prescribed Claim Form to determine the qualification of 

the requesting party and the extent of assistance to be granted; 

b) ensure that all requests and payments are supported with complete 
documentation as enumerated under OWWA MOI No. 01, s. 2018;  

c) request exemption from the limits prescribed by the OWWA MOI 
or seek approval from the appropriate OWWA Office, if the needed 

assistance, as evaluated by the WelOfs, will exceed the authorized 

limits; 

 

Jeddah, K.S.A. 

 

d) prepare a database of services/interventions rendered, and 
complaints/cases filed with OWWA, as a basis in the evaluation of 

the effectiveness and efficiency of the Post in attending to the 

distressed OFWs;  

e) request for additional personnel or designate a Records Officer to 
do the encoding of data and produce a reliable and credible 

database; and 

  



157 

 

Washington 

 

f) provide a complete information or data including the budget 
allocated for each program of the Post and maintain records which 

can be available, especially for audit purposes. 

 

 

OTHER COMPLIANCE ISSUES 

 

Compliance with Tax Laws 

 

35. A total of ₱377,528,876.39 was withheld by the OWWA for CY 2020 and 
remitted ₱303,861,533.53, of which the year-end balance of ₱73,667,342.86 was 

either remitted in January 2021 or for further reconciliation, in compliance 

with Revenue Regulations No. 2-98 dated April 17, 1998. However, in RWO I, 

withholding tax of three percent was deducted from the monthly payment of 

the medical retainer’s services of ₱20,000.00 or a total of ₱240,000.00 instead of 

five percent, which was not in accordance with Section 2.57.2 of Bureau of 

Internal Revenue (BIR) Regulation No. 11-2018, thus resulting in tax deficiency 

of ₱4,800.00. 

 

35.1. OWWA has adopted the centralized payroll system since CY 2017, thus 
withholding and remittances of taxes from the salaries and emoluments of 

employees are done by the OWWA-CO.  

 

35.2. The taxes withheld from suppliers by OWWA-CO and RWOs for purchases 
of goods and services should be remitted to the BIR on or before the 10th 

day of the succeeding month through Tax Remittance Advice (TRA) 

pursuant Revenue Regulations No. 2-98 dated April 17, 1998. However, the 

balances as at yearend of some RWOs showed that these withheld taxes 

were not remitted on due date due to various reasons. The total taxes 

withheld and remitted by the OWWA are summarized as follows:

35.3. Section 2.57.2 of BIR Revenue Regulation (RR) No. 11-2018 provides the 
Income Payments Subject to Creditable Withholding Tax and the Rates 

Prescribed Thereon as follows: 

 

Except as herein otherwise provided, there shall be withheld a 

creditable income tax at the rates herein specified for each class of 

payee from the following items of income payments to persons 

residing in the Philippines: 

 

(A) Professional fees, talent fees, etc. for services rendered – On 

the gross professional, promotional, and talent fees or any 

other form of remuneration for the services rendered by the 

following: 

 

Individual payee: 

 

If gross income for the current year did not exceed ₱3M - 

Five percent (5%); 

If gross income is more than ₱3M - Ten percent (10%) 



159 

 

 

Professional fees subject to expanded withholding tax in the 

Philippines under the Tax Reform for Acceleration and 

Inclusion (TRAIN) Law or RA No. 10963 covers those 

payments to licensed professionals under the Professional 

Regulation Commission (PRC) (e.g. CPAs, medical 

practitioners, engineers, architects, real estate service 

practitioners, etc.). 

 

35.4. In RWO I, the taxes withheld from the payment of services to the medical 
retainer was at a rate of three percent instead of five percent resulting in 

withholding tax deficiency of ₱4,800.00 during CY 2020, contrary to the 

requirement of BIR Revenue Regulation No. 11-2018 issued on March 15, 

2018 which provides for the implementation of the tax reforms on Creditable 

or Expanded Withholding Tax (EWT) in the Philippines under the TRAIN 

or RA No. 10963 effective January 1, 2018,amendingthe three percent 

requirement under Revenue Regulation No. 2-1998. 

 

35.5. The practice of deducting three percent instead of five percent from the 
payment of the medical retainer’s services, deprived the government of 

additional funds to be used for the implementation of development projects. 

 

35.6. We recommended: 
 

a) that Management instruct the accountant of the RWOs NCR, VI, 
VII and XI to expedite the reconciliation and remittance of Due to 

BIR or effect the necessary adjustment, if any; and 

 

b) the Director of RWO I agreed to instruct the Accountant of said 
RWO to withhold the prescribed rate of taxes from the payment of 

the medical retainer’s services as required by the BIR. 

 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

36. OWWA was able to accomplish GAD related activities integrated in the 
regular projects, activities and programs of the CO and the various RWOs. 

However, the annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for CY 2020 of OWWA was 

not submitted to nor endorsed by the Philippine Commission on Women 

(PCW), while the corresponding GAD Accomplishment Report (GAD AR) 

were not yet provided to the Audit Team, contrary to Section 31 of the General 

Provisions of RA No. 11465, also known as the GAA for FY 2020, Paragraphs 1 

and 5(c), Section 37A of Rule VI of the Implementing Rules and Regulations 

(IRR) of RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women (MCW), and the related 

issuances of PCW. 

 



160 

 

36.1. Section 31 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, also known as the 
FY 2020 GAA, states that “All agencies of the government shall formulate a 

Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues 

within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable 

provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, xxx.” 

 

36.2. While Paragraphs 1 and 5(c), Section 37A of Rule VI of the IRR of MCW 
provides the following: 

 

1. Development of and Budgeting for GAD Plans and 

Programs – All agencies, offices, bureaus, SUCs, GOCCs, 

LGUs, and other government instrumentalities shall formulate 

their annual GAD Plans, Programs and Budgets within the 

context of their mandates. x xx 

 

5. Monitoring and Evaluation of the Implementation and 

Budget Utilization of GAD Plans and Programs 

 

a. x xx 

 

c. At the end of the fiscal period, all government agencies 

shall submit to PCW their GAD AR including the utilization 

of the GAD Budget. x xx 

 

36.3. In relation thereto, Section 4.0 of PCW MC No. 2019-02 dated August 1, 
2019 provides that the deadline of encoding and submission to PCW of FY 

2020 GPBs through Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) for 

executive departments, attached agencies, etc is on September 16, 2019. 

Eventually, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the PCW issued MC No. 2020-

03 dated April 27, 2020 which provides guidance on the revision and/or 

implementation of the FY 2020 GPB to implement GAD PAPs that address 

gender issues and concerns related to the COVID-19 situation. 

 

36.4. Moreover, Section 1 of PCW MC No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 
2021provides that the deadline of encoding and submission to PCW of FY 

2020 GAD AR through GMMS for executive departments and their attached 

agencies is on March12, 2021. 

 

36.5. On January 21, 2021, the Audit Team requested the Management of the 
OWWA-CO to submit a copy of the PCW approved GPB and GAD AR for 

CY 2020. Management responded per letter dated February 11, 202, that: 

 

xxx for the CY 2020 GPB, PCW advised OWWA to just 

reflect in the 2020 GAD AR, as advised by the PCW. The 

GAD AR for CY 2020 is still being prepared. ROCS and 

OOCS are consolidating the reports from RWOs and Overseas 



161 

 

Workers (OWs). We expect to submit the same before the 

March 05, 2021 deadline set by PCW. xxx (Underscoring 

supplied) 

 

36.6. However, the letter of the PCW Executive Director to the OWWA 
Administrator dated February 8, 2021, provided the following: 

 

xxx With regard to your FY 2020 GPB and GY 2019 GAD 

AR, since we did not receive any submission of the said 

documents in the GMMS, we recommend that FY 2020 GAD 

activities conducted by your agency be reflected in the 

submission of your FY 2020 GAD AR. As for the FY 2019 

GAD AR, we will facilitate the reopening of the GMMS so 

you could encode your FY 2019 GAD AR in the GMMS for 

record keeping and reference purposes, but there will no 

longer be endorsed. 

 

As provided in Section 8.6 of PWC-NEDA-DBM Joint 

Circular 2012-01, “PWC shall endorse agency GPBs only “… 

if the requested revisions or additional information in answer 

to questions about the GPB are accepted by PCW within the 

prescribed deadlines. “The endorsement of the GPB is to 

ensure that plans, programs and activities to be conducted by 

the agency will contribute to women’s empowerment and 

gender equality goals, and that these will be funded through 

the submission of the endorsed GPB to the DBM in 

accordance with the national budget call. Considering that the 

fiscal years of the GPBs for consideration have already 

passed, we can no longer endorse these. (Underscoring 

supplied) 

 

36.7. As stated in the above statement, the OWWA was not able to submit the CY 
2020 GPB, hence, PWC advised to reflect the actual GAD activities 

conducted by the OWWA in the CY 2020 GAD AR. Still, non-preparation 

of the GPB provided no basis to determine whether the programs and 

activities conducted by the OWWA were aligned with the existing gender 

issues and concerns to be addressed that will contribute to women’s 

empowerment and gender equality goals. 

 

36.8. Nevertheless, some RWOs reported GAD related accomplishments as

36.9. On the other hand, in RWOs NCR and III, the Management failed to 
incorporate relevance and impact of COVID-19 response programs and 

projects to GAD through the use of sex-disaggregated data in the submitted 

reports while in RWO IV-A, the Management failed to submit the copy of 

the PCW endorsed GPB and GAD AR for CY 2020. 

 

36.10. Lastly, as of this date, the CY 2020 GAD AR of OWWA-CO was not yet 
submitted to the COA, hence, precluding the Audit Team from verifying 

and/or conducting audit of the agency’s compliance with the aforementioned 

regulations. 



165 

 

 

36.11. We reiterated our recommendation that the Management submit the 
CY 2020 GAD AR to COA and PCW, and to prospectively submit the 

Annual GPB and the corresponding GAD AR in the format and within 

the timeframe prescribed by the PCW. 

 

36.12. The Management of the respective RWOs commented as follows: 
 

Office Management’s Comments 

OWWA-CO Management commented that the 2019 GPB was 

submitted to PCW for review on July 26, 2019 as per 

advice of the latter since it was the first time the OWWA 

to submit its report direct to PCW. OWWA was, at the 

time, not yet capacitated to accomplish the GPB based on 

the new requirements. Guidance from PCW was needed. 

The said GPB was reverted back to OWWA on August 

16, 2020 with their comments and instruction to use the 

same in the preparation of other reports, which includes 

the 2020 GPB. 

 

The 2020 GPB was immediately prepared thereafter using 

the 2019 GPB with PCW’s comments as a guide. 

However, on October 28, 2020, PCW informed OWWA 

that there is still no request to open on-line to encode the 

2019 AR and the 2020 GPB.  

 

After several follow-ups with PDPMED, OWWA 

received an answer via electronic mail to its appeal, 

advising OWWA to just reflect the 2020 GPB, in its 2020 

GAR. 

RWO NCR Management acknowledged the recommendations and, in 

this regard, RWO NCR appointed a GAD focal person 

and issued a memo to all unit heads to comply with the 

submission of sex-disaggregated data in its reports. 

RWO IV-B Management commented that the RWO submitted its 

GAD Plan and AR to the CO through ROCS using the 

prescribed templates.  

RWO VI During the exit conference, the Management conveyed 

agreement and committed to the preparation of the GPB. 

Further, the AT was informed that a Memorandum was 

already prepared to institutionalize the GFPS of OWWA 

RWO VI. 

RWO XI Management informed that they included the matter in 

their “Issues and Concerns” that was submitted for the 

Year-end Planning Activity of the CO. They stated about 

the difficulty encountered at the regional level to ascertain 



166 

 

Office Management’s Comments 

a synchronized accomplishment vis-à-vis the PCW-

approved GAD Plan. They requested that the CO Gender 

and Development Focal Point System cascade to the 

regional offices the results/comments on the Agency GAD 

Plan submitted to PCW. 

 

36.13. The Audit Team of OWWA-CO rejoined that Management comments are 
duly noted. However, it is still recommended for Management to comply 

with the issuances of PCW especially on the submission of GPB and GAD 

AR. 

 

 

Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability (PWD) 

 

37. Unlike RWOs I and III with expended allocated funds for senior citizens and 
PWDs of ₱4,395,849.07, RWOs NCR, II, IV-A, IV-B and VII did not formulate 

plans and targets to implement Programs and Projects for the benefit of this 

sectors for CY 2020 as required under Section 32 of the General Provisions of 

RA No. 11465 for FY 2020 nor allocated the required one percent of the funds 

for the purpose. 

 

37.1. Section 32 of the RA No. 11465 or the GAA of FY 2020 “states that all 
agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects 

intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with 

disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the 

same in their regular activities. Moreover, all government infrastructure and 

facilities shall provide architectural or structural features, designs or 

facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of 

persons with disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA No. 

7277.” (Emphasis supplied). 

 

37.2. Section 4.2 of the Joint DBM and DSWD Circular No. 2003-01 dated April 
28, 2003 provides that “All government agencies, departments, bureaus, 

offices, commissions and state universities and colleges shall allocate at 

least one percent (1%) of their respective budget for the implementation of 

plans, programs, projects, activities and services for older persons and 

persons with disabilities” 

 

37.3. For CY 2020, the RWOs NCR, II, IV-A, IV-B and VII did not formulate, 
plans, program, and projects intended to address the concerns of senior 

citizens and PWDs which should be integrated into the regular activities of 

the Agency, and consequently did not allocate funds for the same, contrary 

to the aforecited regulations.  

 



167 

 

37.4. On the other hand, RWOs I and III identified the programs and projects and 
expended funds that were allocated to directly address the concerns of these 

sectors. Details are as follows:

37.5. Although these sectors may be among the beneficiaries of the implemented 
livelihood and medical assistance, Management still needs to identify from 

among its programs and projects, those that directly and fully addressed the 

concerns of senior citizens and PWDs and allocate at least one percent 

budget for their implementation. 

 

37.6. We recommended that the Management (a) formulate plans and 
programs to be integrated into the agency’s regular activities that will 

address the concerns of the senior citizens and persons with disability; 

and (b) allocate at least one percent of the agency’s total budget for 

their implementation. 

 

 

Compliance with Property Insurance Law 

 

38. The insurable assets of various OWWA offices with carrying amount of 
₱20,773,066.17 were not protected against unforeseen events such as loss thru 

fire, earthquake, typhoon and/or flood as these are not insured with the 

General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the Government Service Insurance System 

(GSIS), thus, exposing OWWA to the risk of not being indemnified with the 

equivalent amount thereof, contrary to RA No. 656 as amended by PD No. 245 

dated July 13, 1973 and other pertinent rules and regulations. On the other 

hand, insured Motor Vehicles with insurance premium paid by OWWA CO 

totaling ₱40,342.98 are not included in the submitted RPCPPE, thus raising 

doubt on the validity of disbursement made. 

 



168 

 

38.1. RA No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law dated June 16, 
1951, as amended by PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973 states as follows: 

 
Every government, except a municipal government below first class, 

is hereby required to insure its properties, with the Fund against any 

insurable risk herein provided and pay the premiums thereon. 

 

38.2. In addition, the Office of the President, as well as the COA, have been 
persistent in reminding all National Government Agencies to enforce the 

compliance with the RA No. 656, thus, the following issuances have been 

issued: 

 

a. Memorandum Circular No. 634 dated May 10, 1973 – 
requiring all departments, bureaus, offices, agencies and 

instrumentalities of government, all provincial, city and 

municipal governments and government-owned and controlled 

corporations to insure their properties and assets in accordance 

with Property Insurance Law; 

 

b. COA Circular Nos. 79-112 dated August 30, 1979 – to assist 
the GSIS in implementing the Property Insurance Law; 

 

c. Administrative Order No. 33 series of 1987 – prescribing 
guidelines for insurance of all properties, contracts, rights of 

action and other insurance risks of the government, including 

those in which the government has an insurable interest, with 

theGIF of the GSIS; and 

 

d. COA Circular No. 92-390 dated November 17, 1992– 
imposed that all heads of national agencies, local government 

units and government owned or controlled corporations shall 

be responsible for the preparation and submission of the 

inventory of all insurable physical assets and also requires 

submission of said inventory report to the GSIS not later than 

October 31 of the ensuing year.  

 

e. COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 –provides 
for the guidelines in the use and submission of the Property 

Inventory Form as basis for the assessment of general 

insurance coverage over all insurable assets, properties and 

interests of the government with the GIF of the GSIS. 

 

38.3. Moreover, Item 4.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 
provides definition of Unnecessary Expenses that “The term pertains to 

expenditures which could not pass the test of prudence or the diligence of a 

good father of a family, thereby denoting non-responsiveness to the 

exigencies of the service. x xx This would also include incurrence of

b. Unsubmitted Property Insurance Form (PIF) of Central Office 
 

38.4.3. The PPMD has not submitted the Property Inventory Form which 
is contrary to Property Insurance Law and COA Circular No. 

2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 hence, there is difficulty in 

identifying insurable properties.  

 

38.4.4. Moreover, the AD has submitted Schedule of Prepaid Insurance 
and Insurance Expenses that contains the list of PPEs with 

insurance paid by the OWWA to the GSIS. Examination of the 

same reveals that most of the insured properties are Motor 

Vehicles as well as the two OWWA buildings located in Pasay and 

Intramuros, Manila.

c. Insured Motor Vehicles with insurance premium paid by the 
Central Office totaling ₱40,342.98 are not included in the submitted 

RPCPPE 

 

38.4.5. It was also noted that certain details on the descriptions from the 
respective records of PPMD and AD do not match. Thus, there is 

difficulty in identifying the said insured motor vehicles with 

insurance premiums aggregating ₱40,342.98 if the vehicles 

recorded in the respective data are the same.  

 

38.5. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. secure all insurable assets with GIF of the GSIS in order to ensure 
compensation of the equivalent value in case of loss or damage; 
 

b. submit the PIF not later than April 30, 2021 and include in the 
agency annual budget the amount of premiums for the general 

insurance covering all insurable properties and other assets in 

accordance with COA Circular 2018-002; and 
 

c. establish the existence of the Motor Vehicles with paid insurance 
premium totaling ₱40,342.98 and update the submitted RPCPPE. 

 

38.6. The Management of the respective offices commented as follows: 
 

Office Management’s Comments 

CO Management commented that they will comply with the 

submission of the PIF and shall coordinate with the 

Engineering and General Services Division (EGSD) and 

Financial Investment Management Office (FIMO) as regards 

for the inclusion of the amount of premiums for the general 

insurance covering all insurable properties and other assets, 

especially the Motor Vehicles totaling ₱14,100,752.00 in the 

agency annual budget as per COA Circular No. 2018-002. 

 

Also, they will comply with the updating of RPCPPE to 

establish the existence of the Motor Vehicles with paid 

insurance premium totaling to ₱40,342.98. 

 

RWO 

NCR 

In line with the cited recommendations, the Management 

have reconciled the RCPPE with the accounting records. 

Also, Management is on the process of securing insurance of 

all its insurable assets with the General Insurance Fund. 

RWO I Management explained that they were not able to insure their 

motor vehicles due to the pandemic, but they committed to 

insure the vehicles this CY 2021.

COA Circular No. 2018-002 and ready for submission to 

GSIS. 

 

 

Compliance with National Disaster Risk Reduction Management (NDRRMF) 

 

39. The Agency did not formulate plans relative to the mainstreaming of Disaster 
Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) in its programs and projects 

contrary to Section 36 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020. 

 

39.1. Section 36 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 states that: 
“All Agencies of the government shall plan and implement programs and 

projects, taking into consideration measures to climate change adaptation 

and mitigation, and disaster risk reduction, based on climate and disaster 

risk assessment…” (Underscoring supplied) 

 

39.2. The purpose of mainstreaming DRRM into the programs and projects of the 
Agency is to enable the Agency to undertake effective measures to 

reduce disaster risks within the existing framework by formulating and 

implementing applicable plans, programs and strategies to reduce disaster 

risks and eventually lessen the damage caused by manmade or natural 

calamities such as typhoons, earthquakes, floods, droughts, volcanic eruption 

and civil war /political conflict through prevention. It will also aid the 

Agency Management to identify and plan local capabilities to cope with 

these calamities.  

 

39.3. On January 21, 2021, the Audit Team requested Management for a copy of 
the OWWA DRRM Fund for CY 2020 and the reports on its allocation, 

distribution and utilization. However, as of today, no such report was 

received from the Management, hence, signifying that the OWWA did not 

formulate plans relative to the mainstreaming of DRR in the OWWA 

programs and projects. 

 

39.4. Moreover, per submitted Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation 
(AAPSI) as of December 31, 2020 on DRRM observation noted in CY 2019, 

action to be taken by the Management includes coordination with the 

Climate Change Commission (CCC) so they may be briefed on the National 

Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP) for the long-term program and 

strategies for climate change and adaption. However, no update on that 

action was provided to COA. 

 



172 

 

39.5. On the positive note, all personnel of RWO X attended an orientation on 
Disaster Risk Reduction and participated in the fire and earthquake drill in 

the building premises. 

 

39.6. We reiterate our recommendation that the Management formulate 
plans relative to the mainstreaming of DRRM in the OWWA programs 

and projects pursuant to relevant provision of the General Provisions of 

the GAA for the succeeding years. 

 

39.7. We also recommended that Management submit the latest status of 
their plans and actions pertaining to the mainstreaming of DRRM in the 

OWWA programs and projects. 

 

 

Hiring of Job Orders  

 

40. In eight RWOs, the number of Job Order (JO) workers is considerably higher 
than the number of regular employees, whereby in four RWOs,  the cashiering, 

accounting and disbursing functions were performed by the JOs due to the 

shortage of manpower, in violation to Section 7.2 of CSC-COA-DBM Joint 

Circular No. 1, s. 2017, Section 101 of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-

002.  

 

40.1. Section 7.2 the CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2017 dated June 15, 
2017, provides that “7.2 Contract of service and job order workers should 

not, in any case, be made to perform functions which are part of the job 

description of the agency's existing regular employees.” 

 

40.2. Section 101 of PD No. 1445 provides that, “Every officer of any government 
agency whose duties permit or require the possession or custody of 

government funds or property shall be accountable therefor and for the 

safekeeping thereof in conformity with law. Every AO shall be properly 

bonded in accordance with law.” 

 

40.3. COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides pertinent 
provisions on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances, as 

follows: 

 

Item 4.1.1. Only permanently appointed officials shall be 

designated as disbursing officers; 

 

4.1.5 Only duly appointed or designated disbursing officer 

may perform disbursing functions. Officers and employees 

who are given cash advances for official travel need not be 

designated as disbursing officers;  

 



173 

 

4.1.6Transfer of cash advances from one Accountable 

Officers to another shall not be allowed. 

 

40.4. Details of the personnel complement for each RWOs show that in most 
RWOs, the number of hired JOs to perform regular agency functions was 

more than the regular employees: 

 

RWOs No. of JOs 
Total No. of 

Employees 
Percentage of JOs 

NCR 53 150 35.33 

II 41 49 83.67 

III 104 113 92.03 

IV-B 21 30 70 

V 40 51 78.43 

VI 40 51 78.43 

VII 44 66 66.67 

VIII 26 37 70.27 

XI 29 N/A N/A 

XIII 22 28 78.57 

 

40.5. RWOs I, IV-A, IX, X and XII did not provide any information regarding the 
personnel complement of the Agency. 

 

40.6. While CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2018 dated November 9, 
2018 stated that agencies are allowed to renew existing individual contract 

until December 31, 2020 so as not to impair the delivery of public services, 

however, the RWOs have to consider and observe the provisions of Section 

7.2 of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2017, Section 101 of PD No. 

1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002. 

 

40.7. In RWO XIII, the cashiering function was performed by a JO worker and not 
by the personnel designated as Cashier. Nonetheless, reports such as Report 

of Check Issued (RCI), Report of Collection and Deposit (RCD) and Report 

of Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) was signed by the latter. 

 

40.8. In RWOs X and XI, the functions of the Accountant such as preparation of 
the BRS, JEVs, SLs and GLs were performed by a JO worker although all 

reports were signed by the designated Accountant, under concurrent 

capacity. 

 

40.9. Likewise, in RWO V, JO employees were allowed to perform disbursing 
functions, instead of the designated SDOs who are permanent employees 

and duly bonded. 

 

40.10. For CY 2020, a total of ₱40,210,000.00 WAP assistance in RWO V, as 
discussed earlier was paid through the cash advances of the SDO and was 

transferred to the JO employees who made the payments to beneficiaries of 



174 

 

WAP during the scheduled pay out held in a venue usually in the covered 

court at the premises of the LGU Region 5. 

 

40.11. The practice of allowing JOs to perform disbursement functions is contrary 
to the above-cited regulations and exposes government funds to risk of loss, 

misuse or misappropriation. Likewise, the payment of the WAP assistance 

through cash exposes government funds to various risk of carrying large 

amount of money. 

 

40.12. It is emphasized that cashiering, accounting and disbursing functions play a 
vital role in the operations of the agency. Therefore, it is imperative that it 

shall be performed by a regular employee where accountability can be 

established. 

 

40.13. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. discontinue the practice of allowing JO workers perform functions 
which are part of the job description of the agency's existing 

regular employees such as cashiering, accounting and disbursing 

functions; 

 

b. consider the use of the services of a remittance provider in paying 
the WAP cash assistance to mitigate the risks involved in the 

payment of cash assistance through cash advances in large 

amounts; and 

 

c. settle the issue with regard to the lack of regular personnel in the 
RWOs by making representation with the Department of Budget 

and Management (DBM) for additional plantilla positions. 

 

40.14. The Management of the respective RWOs commented as follows: 
 

Office Management Comments 

RWO V Management explained that they resorted to that option by 

transferring the disbursing function to JOs during the WAP 

assistance payout because the regular employees are all pre-

occupied and loaded with the various programs that need to 

be attended and are not available to be deployed to the 

payout and other SDOs are attending to other financial 

related chores. 

 

With regard to engaging the services of remittance centers, 

Management explained that there are problems met, such as, 

low internet connectivity, un-availability of remittance 

center in remote areas and cost of transportation is high on 

the part of the recipients. 



175 

 

Office Management Comments 

RWO XIII Management acknowledged the above recommendations and 

commented that Agency has a regular employee designated 

as cashier, however, due to further designations, the RWO 

opted on hiring JO personnel to assist the permanent 

employee to address the lack of manpower compliment of 

the region. The Management had already made 

representations to OWWA Central Office with regard to this 

matter and was informed that new staffing pattern was 

already on course by the Human Resource Management 

Division (HRMD) to address the lack of key positions in the 

RWOs. 

 

40.15. In addition, the OWWA Administrator informed during the exit conference 
that the Management is waiting for the approval by the DBM for the 

positions of two Accountant III, 15 Administrative Officer V, 80 Overseas 

Welfare Officer II and 120 Overseas Workers Welfare Officers submitted to 

the Director of the Organization, Position Classification and Compensation 

Bureau, of the said Department.  

 

40.16. The Audit Team of the RWO V stands to the recommendation that JOs 
should not be allowed to perform disbursing functions and the Management 

could recommend to OWWA CO for creation of regular positions to 

augment the present set of permanent positions.
