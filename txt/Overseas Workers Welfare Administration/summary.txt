EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA), an attached agency of 

the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), was formerly known as Welfare and 

Training Fund for Overseas Workers (Welfare-Fund), created through Letter of Instruction 

No. 537 issued May 1, 1977. The Welfare-Fund was institutionalized by the promulgation 

of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1694 on May 1, 1980, as amended by  

PD No. 1809 dated January 16, 1981. It was administered by a Secretariat and begun 

operation on May 4, 1982. Executive Order (EO) No. 126 issued on January 30, 1987 

renamed the Welfare-Fund as OWWA. On May 10, 2016, Republic Act (RA) No. 10801, 

otherwise known as “An Act Governing the Operations and Administration of the 

OWWA”, was issued. This was implemented by Resolution No. 015, Series of 2016, dated 

November 16, 2016 issued by the OWWA Board of Trustees. 

 

The OWWA is the lead membership welfare institution that serves the interest and 

welfare of member-Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs). It maintains 17 Regional Welfare 

Offices (RWOs) as well as 35 Posts in 25 countries overseas as of December 31, 2020. As 

such, OWWA was in the frontline to oversee the mass repatriation of the displaced/affected 

OFWs due to the COVID 19 pandemic.

established materiality threshold of ₱44,475,895.61 or one half percent of the total

monthly reports with the list of claimants as of December 31, 2020,thus the status of 

the ₱999,996,000.00 cash transferred to MLhuillier, the extent of financial assistance 

granted to beneficiaries and the propriety of disbursements by the SP were not 

established by OWWA and in audit as of March 1, 2021. (Observation No. 4) 

 



xiii 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. compel the MLhuillier to account for the ₱999,996,000.00 cash transferred 
by submitting the required reports and to transfer any balance, including 

the interest earned from the cash transfers, to a bank account exclusively 

for the DOLE-OWWA-AKAP for OFW beneficiaries, pursuant to the 

Contract; 

 

b. require the issuance of Supplemental Agreement to cover the amounts 
transferred not covered by the original agreement and include a provision 

for penalties in case of non-adherence by the contracting party; and 

 

c. conduct a regular monitoring and reconciliation of the request for payment 
and actual payments made to prevent delay or non-payment of eligible 

beneficiaries. It is also recommended that Management revisit its procedure 

in the evaluation, approval and payment of benefits under the DOLE-

AKAP Program for the timely, efficient and effective implementation of the 

program.  

 

5. A total of 63 ineligible DOLE-OWWA AKAP recipients from RWOs NCR, I, X and 
XIII were able to avail the financial assistance from the program, contrary to Section 

II of MOI No. 014, series of 2020; while in RWO V, two unqualified recipients were 

able to claim from MLhuillier the DOLE AKAP financial assistance of an OFW who 

left already for abroad, and financial assistance to three recipients from RWO XIII 

were sourced from the OWWA fund instead of from the General Fund. (Observation 

No. 5) 

 

We recommended to the Management of the concerned RWOs to: 

 

a. require the responsible personnel to verify the double-payments and 
determine proper action to be done for the return of the overpayment to 

DOLE, if warranted;  

 

b. require the responsible personnel to evaluate the eligibility of the applicant 
OFWs ensuring that exclusions are imposed; 

 

c. document in the Benefits Availment Program(BAP) the results of 
evaluation to ensure that no double claim/payment to OFWs are made; 

 

d. RWO V, to refrain from allowing unqualified persons to claim the benefit 
due the OWWA member-OFW; and 

 

e. RWO XIII, to ensure that disbursements made are supported with available 
funds earmarked for the specific program to be implemented to avoid 

erroneous charging.

6. OWWA-CO, RWOs I, IX and X did not post in the GPPB Online Portal/ PhilGEPS’ 
website their emergency procurements with total amount of ₱4,606,155,049.15, 

contrary to Section 3.6 of GPPB Circular No. 01-2020, GPPB Advisory No. 05-2020, 

Section 54.3 and Section 7.2 of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184..(Observation No. 

11) 

 

We recommended to the concerned RWOs to: 

 

a. justify the basis for not complying with the requirements on posting and 
ensure that all emergency procurement transactions under the Bayanihan 

Act are posted on the GPPB Online Portal; and  

 

b. post the NOA, Contract, or Purchase Order in the OWWA website or on 
any conspicuous place of the Agency’s premises and the GPPB portal, for 

transparency. 

 

7. For the implementation of the Balik Pinas Balik Hanapbuhay (BPBH) Program, 
₱30,265,000.00 or 95.85 percent of the total budget of ₱31,575,000.00 for the period 

January to December 2020 was released by RWO NCR for repatriated/displaced/ 

distressed 1,769 member-OFW beneficiaries. However, inadequate monitoring of the 

sustainability and viability of the livelihood projects undertaken by recipients was 

observed, as out of the 1769 recipients, only 160 or 9.04 percent were selected for 

monitoring by RWO NCR, of which, only 69 or 3.90 percent responded to the 

Management’s validation, with the BPBH Program Monitoring Report (BPBH-MR) 

not submitted to the Audit Team, contrary to paragraph VI of Memorandum of 

Instruction (MOI) No. 005, Series of 2017. (Observation No. 15) 

 

We commended the Management’s effort in extending immediate relief to 

repatriated/displaced/distressed 1,769 member-OFW beneficiaries by releasing 

funds as budgeted and planned despite the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic and 

recommended to continue the same effort in the implementation of the BPBH 

program. 

 

However, we recommended that Management require the concerned Overseas 

Workers Welfare Officer of the Programs Services Unit to: 

 

a. conduct monitoring/validation of the livelihood projects undertaken by the 
beneficiaries of the Program to ensure that the projects are implemented 

accordingly, as provided by paragraph VI of the MOI No. 005, Series of 

2017 and render a report thereon; and 

 

b. submit the BPBH-MR to the Audit Team. 
 

The foregoing audit observations and recommendations were communicated 

through Audit Observation Memoranda (AOMs) and discussed during the Virtual Exit 



xv 

 

Conference on May 14, 2021 with concerned OWWA officials and employees. Their 

comments were incorporated in the Report, where appropriate. 

 

 

G. Status of Settlement of Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges

respectively, while total settlement was ₱33,600,999.30, details are shown in Part II of this

operational as well as the financial efficiency of the Agency.
