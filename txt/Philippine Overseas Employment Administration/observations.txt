PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
 
A. FINANCIAL AUDIT 
 
Accounting Errors and Omissions 
 
1. The Agency’s Receivables, Financial Liabilities, Inter-Agency Payables and Service 

Income accounts were misstated by an aggregate amount of P8,787,217.89 due to 
accounting errors and omissions, hence resulting in the unreliability of its financial 
statements (FSs) as at December 31, 2020. 

 
1.1 Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 

Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, states that “The FSs shall present fairly 
the financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires 
the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and 
conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, 
liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in Philippine Public Sector Accounting 
Standards1 (PPSAS).” 

 
1.2 Fair presentation of the FSs is likewise mentioned in Section 7, Chapter 19 of the 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I. It further states that the application of PPSAS, with 
additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in FSs that achieve a 
fair presentation. 

 
1.3 Audit of accounts disclosed a total of uncorrected misstatements/errors amounting 

to P8,787,217.89, which affected the accuracy, completeness, classification, 
existence and rights and obligations of the year-end reported balances of 
Receivables, Financial Liabilities, Inter-Agency Payables and Service Income 
accounts in the FSs, as summarized in the table below:

1.4 Section 4, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, on Financial Reporting 
provides that the "Responsibility for the fair presentation and reliability of FS rests 
with the management of the reporting agency, particularly the head of 
finance/accounting office and the head of entity or his authorized representative." 

 
1.5 Furthermore, Section 6 of the same Chapter and Manual, on Qualitative 

Characteristics of Financial Reporting, states that “An entity shall present 
information including accounting policies in a manner that meets the following 
qualitative characteristics enumerated in PPSAS, 

 
Xxxxx 
 
e. Reliability – reliable information is free from material error and 
bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that 
which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to 
represent.   
 
f. Faithful representation – information to represent faithfully 
transactions and other events, it should be presented in accordance 
with the substance of the transactions and other events, and not 
merely their legal form.” 

 



41 
 

1.6 Moreover, Section 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that “Each 
government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations 
conformably with generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance 
with pertinent laws and regulations.” 

 
1.7 The details of the misstatements and related accounting deficiencies and the 

corresponding specific recommendations are discussed further in the succeeding 
paragraphs. 

 
RECEIVABLES 
 
a. Unrecorded DBM-PS deliveries, erroneous recording and unreconciled 2015 and 

PYs’ discrepancies  
  

1.8 The reported balance of the account Due from NGAs (DBM-PS) as of 
December 31, 2020 amounting to P6,512,833.92 is misstated by P3,296,595.02 
due to unrecorded deliveries in CYs 2019 to 2020 amounting to P3,306,595.02 
and correcting entry of P10,000 which was recorded twice.   

 
1.9 Section 21 General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA requires all agencies of the 

government to purchase from the DBM-PS all common-use supplies as mandated 
under Letter of Instructions No. 755 dated October 18, 1978, Executive Order No. 
359, s. 1989, Administrative Order No. 17, s. 2011, and such other guidelines 
issued thereon.  
 

1.10 Chapter 3, on the Description of Accounts in the Revised Chart of Accounts 
(RCA), of the GAM for NGAs, Volume III, prescribes the use of account Due from 
NGAs to record advances for purchases of goods or services as authorized by law, 
fund transfers to the NGAs for implementation of projects and other receivables 
from NGAs. This account is credited upon receipt of goods/services, and 
liquidation of fund transfers or receivables. 

 
1.11 The balance of the account should be reconciled with the account maintained by 

the NGAs where the advances or fund transfers were made to ensure accuracy of 
recorded transactions. 

 
1.12 The DBM-PS subsidiary ledger (SL) account under account Due from NGAs in 

the POEA’s books includes advances/payments to and deliveries from that 
Agency. Confirmation made by the Audit Team with DBM-PS on the POEA 
account balance as of December 31, 2020 disclosed discrepancies amounting to 
P5,702,118.49, wherein DBM-PS confirmed the balance of only P810,715.43, as 
compared with the POEA book balance of P6,512,833.92. 

 
1.13 Analysis and reconciliation made on the POEA SL with the DBM-PS confirmation 

reply resulted in the following:

1.14 Part of the discrepancies shown in the above matrix are PYs’ transactions and 

errors/reconciling items which had not been addressed despite the PYs’ audit 
recommendations. 

 
1.15 The reconciling items include the following unrecorded deliveries totaling 

P3,306,595.02, of which P44,128.04 and P3,262,466.98 were delivered in CYs 
2019 and 2020, respectively, but remained unadjusted in the POEA books:

1.16 On the other hand, a correcting entry amounting to P10,000.00 for an erroneous 

recorded transaction was recorded twice in the books. On September 23, 2020, an 
erroneous entry was made to record the payment of service rendered in Continuing 
Agency Education Program (CAEP) amounting to P10,000.00 by debiting Due 
from NGAs instead of Trust Liabilities - CAEP. Consequently, a correcting entry 
was made on September 30, 2020 to adjust the erroneous entry by debiting Trust 
Liabilities account and crediting Due from NGAs account. However, a correcting 



43 
 

entry was recorded again on December 31, 2020 repeating the same entry made on 
September 30, 2020. 

 
1.17 In view of the mentioned discrepancies, the following affected accounts were 

either overstated or understated:

1.18 The amount of P1,759,107.22, which appears in the POEA books as unreconciled 

PY discrepancies, likewise cast doubts on the correctness of the account’s balance 
at yearend and is discussed in the Other Accounting Deficiencies of the report.  
 

1.19 Meanwhile, DBM-PS failed to record in its books the advance payments made by 
POEA in CYs 2017 to 2020 for the purchase of the following supplies totaling 
P639,043.85. These unrecorded advance payments in DBM-PS books represent 
Agency Purchase Requests (APR) by POEA which were paid in advance thru 
Advice to Debit Account from Cash – Modified Disbursement System (MDS), 
Regular of POEA but were eventually canceled by DBM-PS due to shortage of 
stock.

 Total  639,043.85 
 

1.20 Also, returned goods by POEA to DBM-PS totaling P7,372.40 in PYs remained 
unrecorded in the DBM-PS record.  Thus, the foregoing deficiencies remained as 
reconciling items in the DBM-PS books. This matter, however, was not given 
preference by POEA Management to bring to the former’s attention for correction. 

 
1.21 We recommended that the POEA Management require: 

 
a. the Property Officer to forward to the Accounting Division promptly all 

pertinent documents pertaining to receipt of goods and issuances made 
thereto, particularly the deliveries made by DBM-PS, for proper 
recording in the accounting books;  
 

b. the Chief Accountant and Property Officer to reconcile at least quarterly 
their respective records/reports to establish the correct balance of the 
reported deliveries made by DBM-PS and adjust them accordingly; 
 

c. the Chief Accountant to make adjustments in the books for the 
unrecorded current and prior year DBM-PS deliveries to establish the 
correct account balance; and 
 

d. the Chief Accountant to reconcile the Accounting books with DBM-PS 
books annually to establish the correct amounts of undelivered items and 
remaining balances; and henceforth, to immediately bring to the DBM-PS 
attention the reconciling items determined for correction in their books.  

 
1.22 The Management commented that Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) were prepared 

and posted in CY 2021 to the electronic National Government Accounting System 
(e-NGAS) for the recording of unbooked deliveries. A JEV to adjust the double 
recording made was also prepared and posted as well. 
  

1.23 POEA will also be requesting from DBM-PS the copies of remaining unrecorded 
deliveries as of December 31, 2020 and will also include in the request that the 
returned goods amounting to P7,372.40 be reflected in their statement. 

 
1.24 Further, POEA already sent letter dated December 09, 2020 to the Chief 

Accountant of the DBM-PS regarding the advance payments made but was not 



45 
 

reflected in the books of DBM-PS. The POEA will continue communicating with 
DBM-PS for updates of these payments/deposits. 

 
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 
 
b. Non-recognition of collected income for the liquidated damages and erroneous 

recording of progress billings paid to the contractor  
 
1.25 Accounts Payable paid in CY 2020 for the 5th to 8th Progress billings for the 

renovation of the POEA Blas F. Ople (BFO) Building Ground Floor, 
Mezzanine Floor, and Sixth Floor - Governing Board Room were erroneously 
recorded net of liquidated damages (LDs), hence resulted in the 
overstatement of the Accounts Payable by P3,120,211.85, and understatement 
of Miscellaneous Income account balance by the same amount.  

 
1.26 Analysis of the Accounts Payable account balance of P144,685,151.67 as of 

December 31, 2020 disclosed errors in recording payments of two contracts on the 
renovation of the POEA Building. 

 
1.27 In CY 2018, the POEA awarded a contract to OCM Steel Corporation amounting 

to P137,999,727.47 for POEA BFO Building Renovation of the Basement, Lower 
Ground, Fifth and Sixth Floors. Likewise, in CY 2019, the POEA awarded a 
contract to I.M. Bongar & Co., Inc. amounting to P5,999,999.99 for 
Upgrading/Rehabilitation of Sewage Treatment Plant of the POEA Building. 

 
1.28 In CY 2020, OCM Steel Corporation was declared to be in delay in the completion 

of the contract. As a consequence, the contractor was charged and computed with 
LDs.  

 
1.29 The total LDs for the period January 1 to December 31, 2020 amounted to 

P3,120,211.85. It was noted that there were no entries made to recognize the 
revenue from the LDs deducted from the progress billings. The recording of 
payment of progress billings and recognition of LDs are separate and distinct 
transactions; therefore, cannot be offset with each other. However, for ease of 
collection of the said damages, the POEA paid the contractor net of LDs as well 
as other deductions for every billing made, as illustrated below:

1.30 However, review of accounting entries in relation to the above transactions 
revealed that the amounts debited to Accounts Payable account under the name of 
the contractor were Gross Billings net of LDs instead of the proper Gross Billings 
corresponding to the contractor’s accomplishments. The entries made as compared 
with the correct entries prescribed by GAM are illustrated below:

Miscellaneous Income ( for the paid LDs)  3,120,211.85 

 
1.31 In effect, the Accounts Payable account for OCM Steel Corporation was overstated 

by P3,120,211.85 and the Miscellaneous Income was understated by the same 
amount for the unrecognized income from LDs.

1.32 On December 29, 2020, the following adjusting entries were made through

the affected accounts.

         Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit)  3,120,211.85 

 
1.33 However, LDs amounting to P3,120,211.85 for the period January 1 to  

December 31, 2020 were credited to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) instead of 
Miscellaneous Income, hence the LDs were not reflected as income during the 
year.   

 
1.34 We recommended that Management direct the Chief Accountant to: 

 
a. observe the proper recording of the progress payments of contracts 

previously set up as Accounts Payable following the prescribed entries in 
the GAM for NGAs; and 
 

b. make the necessary adjusting entries to correct the error in recognizing 
income from LDs for CY 2020. 

 
1.35 The Management commented that adjustment was already made on the 9th billing 

of OCM Steel Corporation for the year 2021, in particular, liquidated damages 
were already recorded as Miscellaneous Income. Succeeding payments for 
progress billings of contractors will be recorded in the books using the prescribed 
entries in the Government Accounting Manual. 

 
INTER-AGENCY PAYABLES 
 
c. Erroneous recording of remittance of penalties to the BIR 
 
1.36 The accounting entries made to record the remittances of the penalties of 

₱63,213.98 to the BIR were found erroneous, which reduced the balance of 
the account Due to BIR and overstated the Trust Liabilities by such amount.  

 
1.37 Review of the POEA adherence to tax laws, rules and regulation in relation to its 

operation, showed that the Agency had complied with the BIR RRs on the 
withholding and remittances of taxes during the year except for the months of 
March, April and May 2020 causing penalties amounting to P300,965.48 due to 
late filing despite the extension given in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as 
provided in BIR RR No. 7-2020 dated March 27, 2020. The Accounting Division 
explained that during the said months, there was limited work force because of the 
imposed community quarantine. Hence, filing/remitting of taxes on or before the 
prescribed period was not achieved. 

 
1.38 Review of the accounting entries made to record the remittances of the penalties 

of ₱63,213.98 to the BIR disclosed an erroneous entry which reduced the balance 
of the account Due to BIR and overstated the Trust Liabilities by the same amount. 
The Due to BIR account was debited instead of Trust Liabilities wherein 



48 
 

disbursements through checks were paid under Trust Fund. It is not appropriate 
that the account Due to BIR be debited because there were no taxes withheld for 
the said transactions.

1.39 We recommended that Management direct the Chief Accountant to make the 

necessary adjusting entries to correct the error in recording of remittances of 
penalties to the BIR.  
 

1.40 The Management commented that they will immediately effect the necessary 
adjustments to correct the account balances. 

 
REVENUE/INCOME  

 
d. Erroneous recording of collections and income 
 
1.41 The POEA income from Processing Fees for CY 2020 included prior year’s 

collection from Philippine Overseas Labor Offices’ (POLO) Overseas 
Employment Certificate (OEC) of P2,311,458.73, which were recorded only 
in CY 2020, hence resulted in the overstatement of the reported income at 
year-end. 

 
1.42 Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) leaving for overseas employment are required 

to secure an exit clearance in the form of OEC. These OECs may be issued at the 
POEA Central Office, (Land-based Employment Center, Sea-based Employment 
Accreditation and Processing Center, Government Placement Branch, Balik - 
Manggagawa Processing Division (BMPD), POEA’s Regional Centers, Regional 
Extension Units (REUs), Satellite Offices (SO), Licensed agencies participating in 
the In-House Processing Program and at the POLOs. 

 
1.43 POEA’s income is generated mostly from the issuance of Exit Clearance for OFWs 

in the form of OEC which is issued through manual processing, or Electronic 
Receipt (e-Receipt) issued for computerized processing. Processing fees in the 
EGTF transactions are also recognized as income. Processing fees collected are 
deposited in the POEA’s Authorized Government Depository Bank (AGDB) taken 
up as Trust Liabilities and from which the same are eventually remitted to the BTr 
and taken up as Income under the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund of 
the Government.

1.44 As at December 31, 2020, the POEA collected Income from Processing Fee of 
P116,524,952.02, which were remitted to the BTr, breakdown of which is shown 
below:

1.45 Review of the journal entries made by the Accounting Division related to POLO 

Collection deposited in Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) account 
disclosed that an amount totaling P7,375.810.77 was remitted to the BTr and was 
reported as CYs’ income despite inclusion of transactions which pertain to prior 
years. The POLO OEC Collections deposited to Land Bank of the Philippines 
(LBP) and DBP account for CY 2020 amounted to P2,809,247.97 and 
P1,507,791.75 respectively. The journal entries made to record subsequent 
remittances to BTr and recording of income as compared with the appropriate 
amounts are shown below:

1.46 Audit disclosed that based on the submitted report attached per Bank 

Reconciliation Statement (BRS), POLO collections for CY 2020 amounted to 
P4,316,551.79. Hence, POLO OEC recorded as processing fee for the current year 
is overstated due to the inclusion of prior years’ transactions totaling 
P2,311,458.73. Further, based on the submitted Bank Statement, interest income 
earned on two depository accounts amounted to P24,722.12, while it was 
P20,460.43 in the submitted FS, hence a total Interest Income understatement of 



50 
 

P4,261.69 was noted. The details of the variances and suggested adjusting journal 
entries and amounts are shown in the foregoing table. 

 
1.47 We recommended that the Management require the Chief Accountant to 

make adjustments as necessary, to take up the misstatements in the recorded 
Processing Fee and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account and to also take 
up the unrecorded interest income earned through the depository accounts 
and remit the same to the BTr. 
 

1.48 The Management commented that adjusting entries will be prepared to correct the 
misstatement in the recording of receipts of POLO collections.  
 

1.49 The Management also stated that the 4th Quarter interest of LBP was already 
remitted thru a check dated January 13, 2021. Further, DBP automatically credits 
to the account of the Bureau of the Treasury the quarterly interest earned since 
March 28, 2018. 

 
 
OTHER ACCOUNTING DEFICIENCIES 
 
CASH  
 
Unaccounted prior year balances of Cash-in-Bank, Local Currency Current Account 
 
2. The Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account (CIB – LCCA) account 

balance as of December 31, 2020 includes unaccounted PYs balances amounting to 
P23,098,743.94 recorded from CYs 2016 to 2020 for which there were no subsidiary 
records nor necessary data/information to substantiate the beginning balance, hence 
cast doubts on the propriety and reliability of the CIB-LCCA balance as at December 
31, 2020. 

 
2.1 Sound internal control on cash requires prompt and correct recording and reporting 

of transactions to ensure that financial information is reliable, accurate and 
reported within the given accounting period. 

 
2.2 Section 74 of PD No. 1445 states that at the close of each month, depositories shall 

report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition of the 
agency account standing on their books. The head of the agency shall see to it that 
a reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the reports and the balance 
found in the books of the agency. 

 
2.3 Appendix No. 6 of GAM for NGAs, Vol. II describes the SL as a ledger that shows 

detail for each control account in the GL, which is maintained per account and 
fund cluster by the Accounting Division/Unit. At the end of each month, after all 
transactions in the journals have been posted, the debit and credit columns of each 



51 
 

account shall be footed in pencil and the balance indicated in ink. The totals of the 
SL balances shall be reconciled with the corresponding GL controlling account. 

 
2.4 The POEA CIB-LCCA consists of two (2) trust accounts maintained in AGDBs, 

the DBP and LBP, for the following purposes: 
 

Bank Account Purpose 
DBP used to deposit POLO remittances from collections of BM 

PF 
LBP  used to deposit trust collections such as training/seminar 

fee for EPS Korea, CAEP, and PLOS; Fund for EPS-
TOPIK; EGTF and  also remittances of BM PF from 
POLOs. 

 
2.5 As at December 31, 2020, the CIB –LCCA balance of P34,220,408.34 represents 

the total cash for the regular agency fund (RAF) and trust receipts (TR). While the 
bank confirmed balances of LBP and DBP accounts amounted to P34,364,867,51. 
A difference of P144,459.17 pertains to Outstanding Checks of the Agency for CY 
2020 which has yet to be recognized by the bank. Details of the account balance is 
summarized in the table below:

2.6 Analysis of the CIB – LCCA account disclosed that the year-end balance includes 
unaccounted beginning balances amounting to P23,098,473.94 recorded per JEV-
2016-04-000862 dated March 31, 2016, which refers to the set-up of beginning 
balance recorded under the books of RAF.  According to the Accounting Division, 
the Agency did not maintain separate books for RAF and TR before the migration 
of the Agency to e-NGAS in CY 2016, so all amounts set up as beginning balances 
were recorded initially under RAF in e-NGAS. Details of the CIB-LCCA balance 
from years 2016 to 2020 are as follows:

2.7 There were no subsidiary records nor necessary data available to substantiate the 

beginning CIB-LCCA balance recorded under RAF, hence casts doubt on the 
propriety and reliability of the CIB-LCCA balance. It was also noted that except 
for correcting entries, no other significant movement on the GF balances of the 
said account happened from years 2017 to 2020. The Accounting Division said 
they will reclassify the subsidiaries from RAF to TR once reconciliation of all the 
SLs prior to set-up has been made.  

 
2.8 We recommended that the Management require the Accountant to exhaust 

efforts to locate the supporting documents to establish the propriety and 
reliability of the prior years’ balances of the account CIB-LCCA, and to 
reclassify the SLs to the appropriate fund source. 

 
2.9 The Management commented that the Accounting Division is currently working 

on the analysis of Trust Liabilities accounts and their corresponding Cash 
accounts. Specific personnel were already assigned to do these tasks. 

 
RECEIVABLES 
 
Unreconciled difference of Due from NGAS (DBM-PS) account between POEA and DBM-PS 
books 
  
3. The unreconciled 2015 and PYs’ discrepancies of P1,759,107.22 between the POEA 

and the DBM-PS books cast doubt on the reliability of the Due from NGAs account 
(DBM-PS) year-end balance of P6,512,833.92.   

 
3.1 As previously discussed, Chapter 3, on the Description of Accounts in the Revised 

Chart of Accounts (RCA), of the GAM for NGAs, Volume III, prescribes the use 
of account Due from NGAs to record advances for purchases of goods or services 
as authorized by law, fund transfers to the NGAs for implementation of projects 
and other receivables from NGA. This account is credited upon receipt of 
goods/services, and liquidation of fund transfers or receivables. 



53 
 

 
3.2 In the analysis and reconciliation made on the Due from NGAS - DBM-PS account 

of the POEA, it was noted that the account includes unaccounted/undetermined 
PYs’ accumulated variances/ discrepancies of P1,759,107.22, which existed since 
CY 2015 and before, which particulars can no longer be accounted/traced in the 
absence of records, thereby, casting doubts on the reliability of the recorded 
balances of the said accounts. Such figures cannot be found in the DBM-PS 
records. 

 
3.3 We recommended that Management trace from previous records and reports 

the source of the entry made on the said amount/s and analyze and make the 
necessary adjustment in the POEA books.  Conduct periodic reconciliation 
with DBM-PS to bring the two records in agreement. 

 
INVENTORIES  
 
Discrepancies between the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) and 
Accounting records  
 
4. Discrepancies of P1,412,065.77 were noted between RPCIs and Inventory Schedule 

due to: a) unsupported prior year book balances and prior year entries in the 
Inventories account of P367,377.31, for which no record can be traced for 
reconciliation; b) physical count showed various Inventories counted amounting to 
P354,067.83 but not recorded in the books, while some Inventories recorded in the 
books but were not counted, and some inventories were undervalued; and c) absence 
of Inventory Reports for the Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory 
account with a balance of P1,418,733.56, hence, casts doubt as to their existence, 
thereby rendering the Inventories account balance unreliable. 

 
4.1 Section 1, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I covers the definition, 

recognition, measurement, cost formulas to be used and related disclosure 
requirement in accordance with IPSAS 12 on Inventories. 

 
4.2 Moreover, Section 17 of the same Chapter and Manual provides that RPCI shall 

be used to report the physical count of supplies by type of inventory as at a given 
date. 

 
4.3 Further, Section 13 provides that physical count/inventory, which is required semi-

annually, is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property 
custodianship. 

 
4.4 As of December 31, 2020, POEA Accounting records showed Inventories totaling 

P2,363,810.48, which consists of the following:

4.5 However, discrepancies of P1,412,065.77 were noted between the Accounting 

records, Inventory Schedules and the RPCI, which render the Inventories account 
balance unreliable due to the noted deficiencies stated in the table below:

a) Unsupported prior year entries and book balance 
 

4.6 Analysis of various Accounting records and reports on recorded Inventories 
disclosed unsupported/unreliable prior year book entries and book balance of the 
following Inventory accounts:

2. Construction Materials for distribution, as per SL, found

 Total unsupported/ unreliable Book Entries 367,377.31 
 

4.7 The prior year unsupported/unreliable entries were recorded as part of beginning 
balances of the Inventory accounts in the POEA books in CY 2006 upon transition 
to e-NGAS. However, in the absence of records to trace from, no reconciliation of 
the Accounting records and Property reports and records has been made to adjust 
the same. Further, no physical count of inventories was submitted to show the 



55 
 

existence of the said prior year inventory balances. Hence, this necessitates further 
analysis of the inventory entries and balances, and appropriate adjustments.  

 
b) Various inventories were counted but no longer in the books, Inventories still 

in the books but not counted, and undervaluation of inventory 
 

4.8 The Office Supplies Inventory account showed a balance of P577,699.61 as at 
December 31, 2020. However, the RPCI as at December 31, 2020 showed a 
balance of P951,744.71, or a net variance of P374,045.10.  

 
4.9 Analysis of the Inventory Schedule and the RPCI showed that the discrepancy of 

P374,045.10 was due to the following: a) various Inventories were physically 
counted but no longer recorded in the books; b) Inventory items still in the books 
but not counted; and c) undervaluation of inventory in the books, to wit: 

 
Table 18. Summary of Discrepancy between Inventory Schedule and RPCI 

Particulars Amount (In Pesos) 
a) Various Inventories were counted but no longer in the 
books 354,067.83 

b) Inventory items still in the books but not counted (1,854.32) 
c) Undervaluation of inventory in the books 21,831.59 
Total 374,045.10 

 
c) Absence of RPCI for Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory 

account 
 

4.10 As at yearend, Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory account showed 
a balance of P1,418,733.56. However, the existence and completeness of said 
Accountable Forms cannot be ascertained due to the absence of RPCI as at 
December 31, 2020 despite continuous communication and reminder to submit the 
same, hence renders the whole balance unreliable.  

 
4.11 We recommended that Management require:  

  
a) the Chief Accountant to: 
 

 look into the propriety of the unsupported/unreliable prior year 
entries and unreliable beginning book balances of the Inventory 
accounts and adjust the errors, as necessary; and 

 

 record to their appropriate Inventory account classification the 
Inventories found existing as per physical count and the undervalued 
Inventory items; 

 
 
 



56 
 

b) the Property Officer to:  
 
 look into the whereabouts of the Inventory items which were still 

existing in the books but not found at the time of physical count of 
inventory; and 
 

 submit the RPCI for Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers 
Inventory account as of December 31, 2020; and 

 
c) both Accountant and Property Officer to conduct periodic reconciliation, 

at least semi-annually, of the Inventories accounts to arrive at accurate 
and reliable balances of their respective records. 

 
4.12 The Management commented that the Accounting Division is continuously 

working on analysis and reconciliation of various old accounts/e-NGAS beginning 
balances, including Inventory accounts. The Accounting Division and GSPD will 
reconcile their records taking into consideration the observation raised by COA.   
 

4.13 The Management also submitted the copy of RPCI for accountable forms as of 
December 31, 2020. 

 
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PPE)  
 
Several PPE items not appropriately classified 
 
5. Several PPE items were not appropriately recorded in their proper account 

classification as prescribed under the RCA of the GAM for NGAs, Volume III, hence 
either overstating or understating some items/classes of PPEs including their 
respective accumulated depreciation in the aggregate amount of P7,197,226.62 in CY 
2020. 

 
5.1 The RCA as embodied in Volume III of the GAM provides for the classification 

of different PPE to be recognized in the book of accounts of agencies and their 
description. Amongst others are land, buildings, power supply systems, other 
structures, machinery, office equipment, information and communication 
technology equipment, communication equipment, disaster response and rescue 
equipment, medical equipment, sports equipment, other machinery and equipment, 
motor vehicles, furniture and fixtures, books, and other PPE. 

 
5.2 Review of the PPE Ledger Card (PPELC) as of December 31, 2020 being 

maintained by the Accounting Division disclosed that PPEs with net aggregate 
value of P7,197,226.62 were not recorded to their proper account classification 
prescribed in the RCA as provided by the GAM, e.g., some Other Machinery and 
Equipment were recorded as Other Structures, Information and Communication 
Technology Equipment were recorded as Communication Equipment, etc.   

 



57 
 

5.3 As a result, the following accounts were either overstated or understated in the 
book of accounts of POEA:

Total 7,197,226.62 7,197,226.62 
 

5.4 We recommended that Management direct the Chief Accountant to reclassify 
the abovementioned PPEs to their proper accounts to correct the PPE 
balances in the books of accounts.  

 
5.5 The Management commented that adjusting entries will be prepared to correct the 

recording of PPE accounts. They will be reviewing the original entries and collect 
supporting documents of JEV preparation. 

 
Discrepancies between the Accounting books and RPCPPE 
 
6. Discrepancies of P63,598,694.12 were noted between the balances of the account PPE 

as against the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) due to: a) PPEs 
physically counted but not recorded totaling  P11,249,081.03, b) recorded but not 
existing valued at P27,676,284.99, and c) some recorded value/costs in the books 
differ with the amounts in RPCPPEs by  P47,171,490.16, aside from the unidentified 
items of Building, Other Equipment, and Other PPE recorded as part of beginning 
balances in the POEA books in CY 2016 upon transition to e-NGAS and named as 
‘For reconciliation’ with a net book value of P81,278,940.09,  hence cast doubt on the 
existence and completeness of recorded PPE and rendered the year-end balances 
unreliable. Furthermore, Property Cards (PCs) were not properly maintained for all 
items of PPE.  

 



58 
 

6.1 Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, on the Physical Count 
of PPE, provides that: “The entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, 
which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count 
of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 71) as at December 31 of 
each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 
31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during 
the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper 
accounting/recording.” 

 
6.2 Likewise, Section 42 of the same Chapter and Manual, on the Accounting and 

Property Records to be Maintained for PPE, states that “The Chief Accountant 
shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE including work and other 
animals, livestock, etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the 
acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment 
loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the 
Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their 
custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC 
shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They 
shall also be reconciled with other property records like PAR.” 

 
6.3 The PPE accounts of POEA as of December 31, 2020, excluding Construction in 

Progress account, showed a total PPE balance of P315,529,861.15. However, the 
RPCPPE as of December 31, 2020 showed a total PPE of P251,931,167.03, hence 
presented a net discrepancy of P63,598,694.12 between the books and physical 
count, to wit:

6.4 Further analysis of the PPE book balances and the RPCPPE showed that the 
discrepancy of P63,598,694.12 was due to the following: i.) PPEs totaling 
P11,249,081.03 were counted but not recorded in the books; ii.) PPE items totaling 
P27,676,284.99 were recorded in the books but not counted; iii.) variances totaling 
P47,171,490.16 between the amount of the PPE items recorded per books and the

6.6 The unidentified items of Building, Other Equipment, and Other PPE were 
recorded as part of beginning balances in the POEA books in CY 2016 upon 
transition to e-NGAS and named as ‘For reconciliation’. However, as of yearend, 
no reconciliation has been made to reclassify each items into specific categories of 
PPEs as required by the GAM. As a result, no depreciation of the said items of 
PPE was recognized from CYs 2016 to 2020.    

 
6.7 Furthermore, the Property Officer failed to properly maintain PCs prescribed under 

Section 42, Chapter 10, of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I for all items of PPE to 
monitor receipt, transfer and disposition of PPE. Some PPE have no PCs, hence 
no record to reconcile the balance per PPELC maintained by the Accounting 
Division.  

 
6.8 We recommended that the Management require the: 

 
a. Chief Accountant and Property Officer to conduct at least semestral 

reconciliation of their respective Accounting records and Property 
records and reports; 

 
b. Chief Accountant to: 

 
 maintain PPELC to present the details of the PPE per account 

category instead of a lump sum basis, reconciled with the Property 
records and reports to support the controlling PPE account book 
balances;  
 

 make adjusting entries to reflect the PPEs found existing but not 
recorded in the books of accounts; 

 
c. Property Officer to: 

 
 maintain and update PCs to account for the receipt and disposition of 

all items of PPE;  
 



61 
 

 come up with a strategic plan, which may involve support from other 
personnel and the concerned respective offices/end-users, for the 
conduct of complete annual physical count of all PPE, and submit the 
corresponding RPCPPE to concerned agency officials; and 

 
 look into the whereabouts of the PPEs which were recorded in the 

books but not found at the time of PPE physical inventory.   
 

6.9 The Management commented that the Accounting Division and GSPD are 
gradually working on the reconciliation. 
 

RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES ACCOUNTS 
 
Dormant Receivables and Liabilities accounts 
 
7. Out of the total balance of P15,282,887.07, P10,905,722.71 or 71.36 percent remained 

non-moving from six to 37 years in the following accounts; a) Accounts Receivable, 
b.) Due from NGAs, c.) Advances to Officers and Employees, d.) Due to Government-
Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs); and e.) Due to NGAs. Likewise, the 
receivables collectability is doubtful or nil due to absence of supporting records, 
rendering the validity of the said accounts doubtful. Management failed to conduct 
reconciliation and initiate request from the Commission on Audit to write-off the 
dormant accounts under COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 9, 2016 and 
COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 5, 1997. 

 
7.1 Section 111 of PD No. 1445 states that: 

 
  “(1) The account of an agency shall be kept in such details as is 

necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be 
adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies 
of the government 

 
    (2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall 

be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate 
or misleading information.” 

 
7.2 COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 5, 1997 defines dormant account as an 

individual account or group of accounts which balances remained non-moving for 
more than five years. Section III(B) of the same Circular also provides the 
guidelines on these accounts, as follows: 

 
 “a.  Dormant accounts in an active fund shall be reviewed, analyzed and 
reconciled together with the other related accounts in the Trial Balance 
(TB). 
 



62 
 

 b. After the review and validation of accounts, the following procedures 
shall be followed:  

b.1  Effect the adjusting entries and prepare the preliminary TB 
b.2  Determine the proper disposition of reconciled and validated 

accounts: 
b.3 If there are cash accounts which will affect the books of the 

National Treasury, furnish the BTr with the JV pertaining 
thereto; and 

b.4  If the analysis/review of the accounts/funds is not possible due 
to absence of records and documents, the agency head 
concerned should request for write-off and/or adjustment of 
account balances from the COA, supported by: 
b.4.1 List of available records and extent of validation made 

on the accounts; and 
b.4.2 Certifications and reasons why the books of 

accounts/records, FSs/schedules and supporting 
vouchers/documents cannot be located.” 

 
7.3 COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 9, 2016 further defines Dormant 

Receivable Accounts as accounts which balances remained inactive or non-
moving in the books of accounts for 10 years or more and where 
settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained. 

 
7.4 On the procedures to write-off dormant accounts, Section 8 of the same COA 

Circular provides that: 
 

“8.2 The head of the government entity shall file the request for authority to 
write-off dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund 
transfers to the COA Audit Team Leader (ATL) and/or Supervising Auditor 
(SA). No filing fee is required. 

 
8.3 The request shall be supported by the following documents: 

a. Schedule of dormant accounts by accountable 
officer/debtor/government entity and by account, certified by the 
accountant and approved by the Head of the government entity; 
 

b. Certified relevant documents validating the existence of the conditions, 
as applicable, such as: 
 
Xxx 

  b.6 Proof of exhaustion of all remedied to collect the receivables 
and demand to liquidate the cash advances and fund transfers, such 
as but not limited to copies of served or returned demand letters: 

   



63 
 

 b.7 Certification by the responsible officials of the entity to the 
effect that there are no records/documents available to validate 
claim: and  

 
 b.8 Other justifications, like in the case of request for write-off due 

to loss of documents, the circumstances of the loss should be stated 
in the letter-request.” 

 
7.5 The Trial Balance as of December 31, 2020 showed that the balances with dormant 

accounts for the following Assets and Liabilities accounts of the POEA amount to 
P15,282,887.07, details are as follows:

*Based on available data 

 
7.7 The dormant balances remained in the books as of December 31, 2020 despite the 

recommendation of the Audit Team in the prior years’ AARs to reconcile those 
balances with the records of the concerned government agencies, private 
sponsoring organizations and creditors (for receivables and payables); and if 
necessary, make a request to write-off the said account balances. However, the 
Management still has not made any reconciliations nor made a formal request to 
write-off balances of said accounts. Hence, the inclusion of the dormant accounts 
of doubtful validity and remote or nil collectability affects the reliability of the 
affected asset and liability accounts balances presented in the financial statements.  
Actions taken by the Management were inadequate to address these deficiencies. 

 
7.8 We reiterated our prior years’ audit recommendations and further 

recommended that Management require the concerned agency officials to: 
 
a. submit the required documents to facilitate the approval of the requested 

write-off of dormant receivables amounting to P1,175,269.00 arising from 
employers’ unpaid processing fees;  



65 
 

 
b. adopt alternative measures to enforce the collection of the remaining 

dormant receivables including applicable legal action against the debtor 
foreign employers in coordination with the Philippine foreign offices in 
the countries of the employers;  

 
c. exhaust efforts to locate the documents supporting the dormant unsettled 

advances of P107,567.41 recorded as Revolving Funds but without 
supporting details; 

 
d. reconcile the dormant Receivables and Liabilities accounts with the   

debtor/creditor government agencies to determine their validity; and 
 
e. if after all efforts to collect and determine validity of the dormant accounts 

prove futile, submit request for write-off of the accounts which became 
dormant for more than 10 years supported by the required documents and 
guided by the procedures in the write-off of dormant accounts as set forth 
in COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 9, 2016. 

 
7.9 The Management commented that the Accounting Division has exerted efforts to 

retrieve/locate important papers pertaining to these dormant accounts but to no 
avail as of now. The Division just transferred to their newly renovated office in 
September 2020 and is still in the process of unboxing and organizing files in the 
storage room. 
 

7.10 The Management also commented that the Administration will explore other ways 
to collect the receivables from foreign employers. The said AOM was endorsed to 
the Legal Counsel as to priority of legal action taking into consideration and the 
cost and age of receivables. 
 

7.11 The Management further posited that it intends to pursue the request for write-off 
of long outstanding accounts. 

 
REVENUE/INCOME  

 
Non-maintenance of updated subsidiary records and discrepancy of income recorded per 
GL and CRJ 
 

8. The failure by the Management to maintain updated subsidiary records resulted in 
the differences of the recorded collected income per General Ledger (GL) from that 
of the: a) Cash Receipts Journal (CRJ) of collections from OEC (COs and REUs by 
P50,000.00; and b) SL balance pertaining to POLO OEC by P2,905,686.19, hence 
cast doubt on the reliability of the reported income for CY 2021.  

 
8.1. Among the books of accounts that are required to be maintained by NGAs as 

prescribed in Section 12, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Vol. I is the SL. The 



66 
 

SL is required to be maintained for each of the control account in the GL. The SL, 
as shown in Appendix 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Vol. II, shows the details for each 
control account in the GL which is maintained per account and fund cluster by the 
Accounting Division/Unit. 

 
8.2. Section 69(1) of PD No. 1445 provides that “Public officers authorized to receive 

and collect moneys arising from taxes, revenues, or receipts of any kind shall remit 
or deposit intact the full amounts so received and collected by them to the treasury 
of the agency concerned and credited to the particular accounts to which the said 
moneys belong. Xxxx” 
 

8.3. Comparison made between the amount recorded per Processing Fee account and 
the submitted RCD (CO and REUs) totaling P109,856,073.50 and 
P109,806,073.50, respectively, showed a variance of P50,000.00, as follows: 
 

Table 25. Discrepancy between GL and RCD/CRJ

Per GL   109,856,073.50  
Per RCD/CRJ   109,806,073.50  
Difference           50,000.00 

 
8.4. On the other hand, comparison of the submitted SLs of POLO OEC collections, 

which is based on the RCD forwarded to the Management and RCD from the 
POLO in ten countries for the months between March to December, showed an 
unreconciled difference of P2,905,686.19 between the amount recorded per GL 
Cash in Bank-LCCA account. Details of the unreconciled difference are as 
follows: 

 
Table 26. Unreconciled Difference per GL and SL

Difference (1,527,906.78) (1,377,779.41) (2,905,686.19)  

 
8.5. The said unreconciled differences between the balances in the controlling GL Cash 

in Bank account and the subsidiary records maintained cast doubts on the 
reliability of the Cash in Bank and corresponding Trust Liabilities account 
balances reported as at year-end.  
 

8.6. We recommended that the Management require the Chief Accountant to: 
 

a. determine and verify the details of the discrepancy noted between the 
CRJ and the amount recorded in the controlling GL account Income-
Processing Fee, and to make adjustments as necessary to correct the 
account balance; and 
 



67 
 

b. update monthly the subsidiary records of the POLO OEC collections and 
to conduct periodic reconciliation of the subsidiary records with the 
corresponding GL accounts Cash in Bank, Cash-Treasury Agency, 
Deposit account, and Income-Processing Fee, and make appropriate 
actions thereto to resolve the discrepancies.  

 
8.7. The Management commented that the Accounting personnel in-charge of 

recording collections and deposits is currently looking on the matter and 
adjustments will be made as soon as the origin of discrepancy is determined. 
Further, reconciliation of the accounts CIB, CTAD and Income-Processing Fee 
will be done regularly. In addition, the SL and GL balances as of  
December 31, 2020 of these accounts will be reviewed thoroughly and adjustment 
will be effected if necessary. 

 
 
B. COMPLIANCE AUDIT 
 
Delays in the submission of required financial and accounting reports 
 
9. Delays and non-submission of the required financial and accounting reports and 

documents for CY 2020 within the prescribed period is not in accordance with 
Section 60, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of the 
2009 Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts (RRSA), and Section 32, 
Chapter 3 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus prevented the timely audit, review 
and evaluation of the Agency’s financial transactions and reporting of audit results 
thereof. 

 
9.1 Section 60, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, on Financial Reporting, 

states that: 
 

“All NGAs shall prepare and submit the following financial statements and 
schedules as follows, within the prescribed deadline: xxx”

9.2 Moreover, Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of the RRSA, as prescribed under COA Circular 
No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, provide for the responsibilities of the 
agency head and accountant for audit and settlement of accounts, pertinent portions 
of which are quoted below: 

 



68 
 

“Section 7.1 Responsibility of the Agency Head 
 

7.1.1 The head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all 
government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: 
(a) the required financial and other reports and statements are submitted 
by the concerned agency officials in such form and within the period 
prescribed by the Commission; (b) the settlement of disallowances and 
charges is made within the prescribed period; (c) the requirements of 
transactions suspended in audit are complied with; and (d) appropriate 
actions are taken on the deficiencies noted as contained in the NSs, NDs, 
NCs and AOM. 

 
Section 7.2 Responsibility of the Agency Accountant 

 
7.2.1 The Chief Accountant. Bookkeeper or other authorized official 
performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency 
shall ensure that: 
 

a) the reports and supporting documents submitted by the accountable 
officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and 
submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing 
month; 

 
b) the financial records are made accessible at reasonable hours to the 

Auditor or his authorized representatives when needed;” 
 

9.3 On the other hand, Section 32, Chapter 3 of the GAM for NGAs, Vol. I, which 
prescribes the submission of budget and accountability reports, provides that:

9.4 Section 122 of PD No. 1445 also provides the following: 
 

“Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the 
Commission may under regulations issued by it require the agency heads, 
chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, 
administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials of the 
various agencies to submit TBs, physical inventory reports, current 
plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the 
exercise of its functions. 
 
Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents and 
reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of 
payment of their salaries until they shall have complied with the 
requirements of the Commission. 
 
No appropriation authorized in the General Appropriations Act shall be 
available to pay the salary of any official or employee who violates the 
provisions of this section, without prejudice to any disciplinary action that 
may be instituted against such official or employee. 

 
9.5 POEA adopted the use of e-NGAS, which facilitated the speedy generation of 

various financial reports as well as the processing of the financial transactions. 
Notwithstanding the principle behind the practice of e-NGAS, POEA failed to 
properly benefit from its use and defeated the very purpose of it. 

 
9.6 Review on the submission of various financial reports and FSs of POEA showed 

that these were not submitted by the Accounting Division within the period 
prescribed by the abovementioned rules and regulations.  

 
9.7 As of January 18, 2021, inventory of the financial reports and documents, BRS, 

Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) and various transactions with JEVs submitted by 
the Accounting and Budget Divisions to the Audit Team show significant delays

9.8 The Audit Team recognizes that due to COVID-19 Pandemic that caused major 
disruption of work in CY 2020, the required financial reports and documents were 
not submitted on time. However, submission of the required reports and documents 
had been long overdue for audit, review, evaluation and the preparation of the 
AAR of POEA for CY 2020 for the audit results. 

 
9.9 Moreover, the delays on the submission of financial reports and other financial 

documents, even before the COVID-19 Pandemic, had always been a consistent 
observation of the Audit Team in previous years. The Management had always 
justified that the major cause thereof was due to the lack of Accounting personnel 
who could assist in the processing and encoding of the documents. Until now, the 
Management has yet to address the issue of lack of Accounting personnel.  

 
9.10 We reiterated the prior years’ audit recommendation that the Management 

require the concerned Accounting and Budget officials and employees to: 
 

a. submit the monthly, quarterly and yearly financial reports and the 
pertinent supporting documents within the prescribed period to enable 
the Audit Team ample time to review the reports, audit the related 
transactions and to report the corresponding results of audit; and    

 



71 
 

b. be likewise reminded of their responsibilities in rendering financial 
reports and the disciplinary action that may be instituted against official 
or employee who have not complied with the requirements as provided in 
Section 122 of PD No. 1445. 

 
9.11 The Management commented that the COVID-19 Pandemic resulted in reduced 

manpower and limited working hours in the Accounting Division. From March 16 
to May 31, 2020, only 2 Accounting staff were able to come to POEA. As such, 
they had to attend to more pressing daily matters. The extension of limited working 
hours until now added to the delay in encoding and approving of transactions in e-
NGAS. The Accounting Division is again, reminded of their responsibilities on the 
submission of FSs.  

 
9.12 Catch up strategies were being implemented to fast-track submission of reports. 

These include assigning an Accountant III to focus on FS preparation. No 
additional task is/will be assigned to her until we have completely submitted the 
CY 2020 reports. Additional accounts are also assigned to assist in approving 
posting in the e-NGAS. The personnel of Accounting Division are directed to 
render overtime. 

 
TRUST LIABILITIES  

 
Unutilized funds under Trust Liabilities account not taken up as income 
  
10. The unutilized funds under Trust Liabilities amounting to P15,727,638.67 recorded 

under the Cash in Bank (CIB) - Local Currency, Current Account (LCCA) intended 
to cover expenditures for Employment Permit System (EPS) – Test of Proficiency in 
Korean (TOPIK), EPS-Training Fees, CAEP and Pre-Licensing Orientation 
Seminar (PLOS) remained unremitted to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) as at 
December 31, 2020, contrary to the provisions provided in Sections 4 and 65 of PD 
No. 1445 that resulted in unrealized and unrecognized Miscellaneous Income 
accruing to the General Fund of the government.    
 
10.1 Section 4 of PD No. 1445 states that “Trust Funds shall be available and may be 

spent only for the specific purpose for which the trust was created or the funds 
received." 

 
10.2 Moreover, Section 65 of the same PD states that “Accrual of income to 

unappropriated surplus of the General Fund. – (1) Unless otherwise specifically 
provided by law, all income accruing to the agencies by virtue of the provisions of 
the law, orders and regulations shall be deposited in the National Treasury or in 
any duly authorized government depository, and shall accrue to the 
unappropriated surplus of the General Fund of the Government.”  

 
10.3 Skill tests and training/seminars are undertaken for the recruitment agency’s 

recruitment education program under the following POEA programs: a) EPS-
TOPIK; b) CAEP; and c) PLOS. Fees collected by the POEA are constituted as 



72 
 

trust funds deposited in a bank account to cover projected expenses for each 
activity until its completion/conclusion in a given year and any balance shall be 
deposited to the BTr as income at year-end and shall accrue to the unappropriated 
surplus of the General Fund of the Government. 

 
a) The EPS-TOPIK funds are intended to conduct specific skill tests to select 

eligible Filipino job seekers who can then apply for jobs and get proper 
working visa for Korea. While EPS-Training Fees are collected from selected 
applicants for refresher course in preparation for deployment to their 
employers in Korea. 
 

b) CAEP funds are seminar fees from the officers and personnel of licensed 
recruitment and manning agencies for the conduct of agency education 
program aimed to be more responsive in providing quality information to have 
a more compliant recruitment/manning agency with the POEA legal and 
administrative procedure and processes. 
 

c) PLOS funds are fees collected from agency owners for the seminar as a pre-
qualification requirement for the issuance of a license that should be attended 
by the applying agency’s Sole Proprietor/Proprietress, Managing Partner, 
President, Chief Executive Officer, Operations Manager, Members of the 
Board of Directors, and Branch Managers, to avoid incurring violations which 
can result in suspension or other penalties imposed on the agency. 

 
10.4 The illustrative accounting entries prescribed in the GAM for NGAs, Volume III, 

which are applicable for the collection of fees, disbursement for each activity and 
remittance of unutilized funds to the BTr from EPS – TOPIK, EPS – Training Fees, 
CAEP and PLOS are as follows:

10.5 Analysis of the Trust Liabilities account balance of P243,940,604.02 as at 
December 31, 2020 showed that there were unutilized funds of P15,727,638.67 
deposited in the CIB – LCCA for EPS-TOPIK, EPS-Training Fees, CAEP and 
PLOS that remained unremitted to the BTr at year-end, as follows:  
 



73 
 

Table 29. Balances as at December 31, 2020 
Particulars Amount (In Pesos) 

EPS-TOPIK 1,062,050.81 
EPS- Training Fee 1,816,014.06 
CAEP 11,691,201.10 
PLOS 1,158,372.70 
Total 15,727,638.67 

 
10.6 In effect, the unutilized funds accumulated from the previous and current years 

amounting to P15,727,638.67, which remained unremitted to the BTr as at 
December 31, 2020, were not taken up as income but remained as trust liabilities, 
hence overstated the Trust Liabilities account and understated the Miscellaneous 
Income account balances by the same amount. Had the unutilized trust funds been 
remitted to the BTr every end of the year, this could have reduced the CIB-LCCA 
and the Trust Liabilities accounts to their proper balances and recognized the 
Miscellaneous Income accruing to the General Fund of the government with the 
following accounting entries:

Regular Fund  
Cash - TAD, Regular 15,727,638.67  

Miscellaneous Income  15,727,638.67 
 

10.7 We recommended that Management require:  
 

a. the concerned Officers to remit promptly to the BTr all unutilized trust 
funds for EPS-TOPIK, EPS-Training Fees, CAEP and PLOS and 
henceforth, require strict adherence to the provisions stated in Section 65 
of PD No. 1445; and 
 

b. the Accountant to make the necessary entries to recognize the unutilized 
funds as income upon remittance to the BTr. 

 
10.8 The Management commented that the POEA programs (EPS-TOPIK, EPS-

training, CAEP & PLOS), whose collections are constituted as trust funds, are 
continuing in nature. As such, it is of utmost importance that cash/funds are readily 
available when needed. 
 

10.9 The Management further commented that the Accounting Division will determine 
if indeed there are excess funds taking into consideration the plans and projects of 
program implementors to be effected if necessary. 

 
 



74 
 

Service Agreement contracts not in accordance with DBM-CSC-COA Joint Circular 
 
11. Forty (40) Service Agreement contracts with an aggregate budget of P3,517,819.73 

entered into by the POEA contain provisions for the payment of 13th month pay, 
service leave incentives and mandatory deductions, which is not in accordance with 
DBM-Civil Service Commission (CSC)-COA Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2017, as 
amended. Furthermore, audit of the submitted DVs totaling P3,137,220.36 disclosed 
that no taxes were withheld from the payments of the monthly service fees of the Job 
Orders/Contractors, nor supported with any document/s showing compliance with 
the tax laws requirements. 

 
11.1 DBM-CSC-COA Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2017, as amended, provides for the Rules 

and Regulations Governing Contract of Service and Job Order Workers in the 
Government. 

 
11.2 Section 6.2.2 of the said Joint Circular states that “Engaging the services of 

individual contractor shall be subject to pertinent provisions of RA No. 9184 and 
its implementing guidelines, as applicable...” 

 
11.3 Further, Section 7.4 of the same Joint Circular provides that “The services of the 

contract of service and job order workers are not covered by Civil Service law and 
rules thus, not creditable as government service. They do not enjoy the benefits 
enjoyed by government employees, such as leave, PERA, RATA and thirteenth 
month pay.” 

 
11.4 Furthermore, the 3rd Paragraph of Section 8.0 of the said Joint Circular imposes 

that “Individuals hired through contract of service have the option to enroll 
themselves in social benefit programs thru the Social Security System (SSS), 
PhilHealth and Pag-IBIG Fund as self-employed members.” 

 
11.5 Moreover, Section 9.0 of the same Circular provides that “Individuals hired 

through job order shall be paid wages equivalent to the daily wage/salary of 
comparable positions in government and a premium of up to 20% of such 
wage/salary.” 

 
11.6 In CY 2020, the POEA entered into 40 individual Service Agreement contracts 

with a total budget of P3,517,819.73. 
 

11.7 Review of the Service Agreement contracts disclosed the following deficiencies: 
 

a. Out of the 40 Service Agreement contracts, 36 of which contain similar 
provision that provides for the breakdown of the monthly minimum service fee, 
to wit: 

 
 
 



75 
 

Table 31. Breakdown of Monthly Minimum Service Fee 
Particulars Amount (In Pesos) 

Basic Salary 11,814.00 
13th Month Pay 984.50 
Service Leave Incentive 223.75 
SSS and EC 970.00 
PhilHealth 177.21/200.00 
Pag-IBIG 100.00 

 
b. The service contracts further provides that submission of receipts as proof of 

payment for the mandatory premium contributions (SSS, EC, PhilHealth,  
Pag-Ibig) are required for the subsequent processing of service fee. 
 

c. The 13th Month Pay was paid on a monthly basis equivalent to 1/12 of the basic 
salary. The Service Leave Incentive was fixed at the amount of P223.75 per 
month. The inclusion and payout of 13th month pay and service leave incentive 
to Job Order/Contractor violates Sections 7.4 and 8.0 of the  
DBM-CSC-COA Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2017.  Hence, POEA is not obliged to 
pay for the mandatory premium contributions since the option belongs to the 
Job Order/Contractor as mentioned in the 3rd Paragraph of Section 8.0 of the 
said Circular.   
 

d. Disclosure in the Service Agreement of the mentioned items as basis in the 
computations in arriving at total monthly service fees is no longer necessary 
since the said Circular already provided the manner of computation of the wages 
of Job Orders/Service contractor which is equivalent to the daily wage/salary of 
comparable positions in government and a premium of up to 20% of such 
wage/salary. 
 

e. The project documents of the Service Agreements contracts provided only an 
estimated monthly rate but failed to provide the basis of the said rates. The 
project document should have provided the comparable position in the 
government which the rate was based and adding a premium thereto to comply 
with Section 9.0 of the abovementioned Circular. 

 
11.8 Furthermore, audit of the submitted DVs totaling P3,137,220.36 disclosed that no 

taxes were withheld from the payments of the monthly service fees of the Job 
Orders/Contractors, and were not supported with any document/s showing 
compliance with the tax laws requirements. Under the National Internal Revenue 
Code, as amended, if the individual taxpayer’s gross receipts/income for a year 
does not exceed P250,000.00, the Job Order/Contractor shall submit an Income 
Payee’s Sworn Declaration of gross receipts/sales and the withholding agent shall 
execute its own Income Payor/Withholding Agent’s Sworn declaration stating the 
number of persons who shall not be subjected to withholding taxes as required by 
BIR RR-11-2018. Hence, even if the service fee of each service contractor or Job 



76 
 

Order does not or will not exceed P250,000.00 in a given year, compliance with 
the requirements of our tax laws is still mandatory. 

 
11.9 We recommended that the Management direct all the concerned POEA 

officials to:  
 

a. revise the pro-forma Service Agreement Contract and provisions to 
conform with DBM-CSC-COA Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2017, as amended; 
 

b. comply with the withholding of taxes on Service Agreements/Job Orders 
contracts in accordance with tax laws and regulations and the submission 
of Sworn Declaration for persons who shall not be subjected to 
withholding taxes as required by BIR RR-11-2018; and 
 

c. support the Service Agreement contracts with duly revised project 
documents with provisions on the basis of monthly rates of the Job 
Orders/Contractors.  

 
11.10 The Management commented that the Human Resources Development Division 

revised the pro-forma contract for Job Order/Contractors effective March 2021 to 
exclude the standard social benefits program and the 13th month pay. 
 

11.11 Further, the Management also assured that the Accounting Division is compiling 
the sworn statements, copy of contracts, and TIN ID of the JO/Service Contractors 
for submission to BIR. 
 

 
C. OTHER COMPLIANCE ISSUES 
 
Budget Utilization 
 
12. Out of the total allotment of P549,659,617.26 for Personal Services (PS), 

Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) and Capital Outlays (CO) for 
CY 2020, the amount of P534,646,257.05 was obligated, leaving P15,013,360.21 or 
2.73 percent unutilized or savings generated due to cost-cutting measures and 
reduced operating expenses, and cancellation/deferment of some programs/activities 
because of the current Pandemic situation. 

   
12.1 Under the National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 580 dated April 22, 2020, 

departments, bureaus and offices of the NGAs, as a general rule, shall spend what 
is programmed in their respective appropriations. It highly encouraged, among 
others, the full budget utilization of each agency and provides guidelines on the 
release of the funds for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 and the adoption of economy 
measures in the government due to the emergency health situation.  The following 
guidelines are provided: 
 
 



77 
 

1.2 General Guidelines 
 
1.2.1  To partially generate the required amounts to implement the national 

policy to address the COVID-19 situation, while observing the overall 
expenditure program for FY 2020, government instrumentalities 
concerned are advised that thirty-five percent (35%) of programmed 
appropriations under the FY 2020 GAA shall no longer be made 
available for release effective April 1, 2020. Likewise, at least ten 
percent (10%) of the total released allotments to covered entities 
under Sec. 2 hereof for Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses 
(MOOE) and Capital Outlays (CO), shall no longer be available for 
obligation. 

 
12.2 Analysis of POEA’s budget utilization for CY 2020 as compared to CY 2019 

showed a slight decrease of 0.94 percent in the unobligated allotment from the 
previous year, as presented in the table:

12.6 Notwithstanding the unutilized allotments, the POEA achieved most of its CY 
2020 targets except for the target inspection and assessment of recruitment and 
manning agencies under its Overseas Employment Regulatory Program wherein 
only 47 percent was accomplished.   

 
12.7 We commended the Management in its effort in implementing cost-cutting 

measures and the reduction of related expenses showing an efficient 
utilization of financial resources. However, in view of the effects of the 
Pandemic brought about by COVID-19, we recommended that Management 
continue to monitor activities affected by the Pandemic and to continue to 
develop initiatives, such as the conduct of services/activities online or limit the 
activities outside of POEA office premises, which would further enhance 
prudent utilization of resources in the achievement of the target agency 
performance on its mandated programs, projects and activities. 

 
12.8 The Management commented that the Agency is continuously exercising prudence 

and due diligence “as a good father of a family” in disbursing government funds 
consistent with its intended purposes as identified in the approved GAA. 

 
12.9 The Management also asserted that the outbreak of the Pandemic and the threat re-

emerging infection continues to pose global health as well as economic concerns. 



82 
 

Thus, the POEA Management acknowledge this new living environment and has 
introduced many new initiatives in order to cope up with the challenges and still 
ensure non-stoppage of service delivery to its stakeholders. The ICT Branch has 
launched various online services that cater to the needs of POEA clients in 
compliance with health protocols. Also, conduct of activities outside of POEA 
office premises is generally discouraged, that is why savings from travelling and 
representation expenses were generated at the end of the year. 

 
 
OTHER COMPLIANCE ISSUES 
 
Compliance with Revenue Regulations 
 
13. POEA Central Office (CO) complied with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) 

Revenue Regulations (RR) pertaining to remittance of taxes withheld from suppliers, 
compensation and judgement awards within the prescribed period except for the 
months of March, April and May 2020, causing penalties amounting to P300,965.48 
due to late filing despite the extension given in response to the  
COVID-19 Pandemic as provided in BIR RR No. 7-2020 dated March 27, 2020. 
Further, the Due to BIR account balance of ₱194,712.84 as of December 31, 2020, as 
adjusted, remain unaccounted whether this pertain to unremitted taxes withheld or 
balances subject to reconciliation that may result in adjustments. 

 
13.1 Under Department of Finance (DOF)-DBM Joint Circular No. 1-2000A dated July 

31, 2001, which prescribes the procedure for the remittance of all taxes withheld 
by NGAs to the BIR, NGAs shall file before the BIR a Tax Remittance Advice 
(TRA) supported by withholding tax returns on or before the 10th day of the 
following month after the said taxes had been withheld. 

 
13.2 BIR RR No. 10-2008 dated July 8, 2008 for compensation and Revenue 

Memorandum Circular No. 23-007 dated March 23, 2007 expanded the coverage 
for withholding of Income Tax on Compensation and Expanded VAT. 

 
13.3 BIR RR No. 1-2013 dated January 23, 2013 further expands the coverage of 

taxpayers required to file tax returns and pay taxes through the Electronic Filing 
and Payment System (eFPS) and includes NGAs to mandatorily use the electronic 
TRA. 

 
13.4 BIR RR No. 7-2020 dated March 27, 2020 provides the extension of statutory 

deadlines and timelines for the filing and submission of any documents and the 
payment of taxes pursuant to Section 4 (z) of Republic Act (RA) No. 11469, 
otherwise known as “Bayanihan to Heal As One Act,” declaring a state of national 
emergency over the entire country.  

 
13.5 For CY 2020, the taxes withheld from suppliers and compensation income of 

employees including the beginning balance amounted to P52,139,527.22. Total 



83 
 

remittances amounted to P51,842,511.83, leaving a balance of P6,708,268.05 at 
yearend. After considering the remittances of the December 2020 tax withheld 
totaling ₱6,513,555.21, made through Bank Deposit and eFPS in January 2021, 
the Due to BIR account showed an adjusted balance of ₱194,712.84. Details of 
monthly tax withheld and remittance are shown in the table below:

13.6 The Due to BIR account balance of ₱194,712.84 as at December 31, 2020, as 

adjusted, however, remained unaccounted, whether this pertains to unremitted 
taxes withheld or amount balances subject to reconciliation that will result in 
adjustments that are yet to be effected. 

 
13.7 We recommended that Management direct the Chief Accountant to: 

 
a. analyze/determine the causes of the remaining balance of Due to BIR as 

at yearend amounting to ₱194,712.84 and account for unremitted tax 
collections and remit the same to the BIR, or make the adjustments, as 
necessary, to correct the account balance; and 
 



84 
 

b. develop measures to ensure that tax deadlines are met despite the office 
work limitations brought about by the Pandemic as COVID-19 is foreseen 
to be still prevalent in the near future.  

 
13.8 The Management commented that an Accounting staff was already assigned to 

analyze and reconcile the transactions posted in Due to BIR account. Some 
reconciling items were, in fact, already identified. However, further checking and 
preparation of supporting dcouments have to be done before adjustments can be 
made. Accounting Division will update the Audit Team on the reconciliation and 
adjustments.  
 

13.9 The Management further said that remittance of taxes withheld had been made on 
time despite the imposition of the different types of community quarantines since 
July 2020. Personnel from Accounting Division are always made aware of the due 
dates of reports (including remittance of tax withheld), which unfortunately almost 
all fall on the 10th day of the following month. Work schedules and task 
assignments are organized in such a way that allows ample time for the preparation 
and signing of reports. Succession plan is also in place and can be implemented 
anytime, if necessary. 

 
14. Taxes totaling P898,007.55 were not properly withheld from the contractor’s billings 

due to erroneous tax base used in the computation of the taxes due as prescribed by 
BIR Revenue Regulations. 

 
14.1 The tax base used in computing the taxes withheld was gross billings net of 

recoupment, retention fees and LDs instead of the gross billings less recoupment, 
retention fees only which represent the amount actually or constructively received 
by the contractors subject to Value Added Tax (VAT). The proper tax to be 
withheld should have been as follows:

14.2 Based on the above table, the taxes withheld from progress payments of the two 

contractors were short by P898,007.55 for CY 2020.  
 

14.3 We recommended that Management direct the Chief Accountant to withhold 
the unpaid taxes of the contractors OCM Steel Construction and I.M. Bongar 
& Co., Inc from their next progress payments and, henceforth, use the proper 
gross tax base in the computation of taxes due on their billings. 

 
14.4 The Management commented that the recomputed unwithheld taxes will be 

deducted in their next billing. Further, the proper gross tax base will be used in 
computation of tax withheld in the succeeding progress billings of contractors. 

 
Compliance with the withholding and remittance of Government Service Insurance System 
(GSIS) contributions and loan repayments 
 
15. For year 2020, the POEA has faithfully complied with the Government Service 

Insurance System (GSIS) regulations on the withholding of GSIS contributions and 
repayment of loans from its employees and the remittance thereof within the 
prescribed period pursuant to the provisions of RA No. 8291, otherwise known as the 
“Revised Government Service Insurance Act of 1997.” However, the year-end 
balance of the Due to GSIS account totaling P379,170.85 pertains to the prior years’ 
and CY balances with no details or breakdown, making the account balance 
unreliable. 

 
15.1 Section 6 of RA No. 8291, an Act amending PD No. 1146, as Amended, 

Expanding and Increasing the Coverage and Benefits of the GSIS, Instituting 
Reforms therein and for Other Purposes, provides the following provisions: 

 
“Collection and Remittance of Contributions: 

 
(a) The employer shall report to the GSIS the names of all its employees, their 

corresponding employment status, positions, salaries and such other pertinent 
information, including subsequent changes therein, if any, as may be required 
by the GSIS; the employer shall deduct each month from the monthly salary 
or compensation of each employee the contribution payable by him in 
accordance with the schedule prescribed in the rules and regulations 
implementing this Act. 
 



86 
 

(b) Each employer shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and employers’ 
contributions within the first ten (10) days of the calendar month following 
the month to which the contributions apply. The remittance by the employer 
of the contributions to the GSIS shall take priority over and above the payment 
of any and all obligations, except salaries and wages of its employees.” 

 
15.2 As at December 31, 2020, the Due to GSIS account showed the following balance:

Balance, December 31, 2020 379,170.85 

 
15.3 For CY 2020, the POEA deducted from the salaries of its officials and employees 

the employees’ GSIS contributions and payments of loans totaling 
₱41,260,637.03. However, refund to employees amounting to P6,934,870.08 was 
done due to the GSIS loan moratorium program for members to provide relief to 
government employees whose families are having financial difficulties because of 
the COVID-19 continuing crisis and quarantine measures. The loan moratorium 
shall mean deferment of payment of loan amortization wherein payment/deduction 
of loan amortization shall resume in 2021. On the other hand, the withheld monthly 
GSIS deductions, including the government share, were verified remitted within 
the prescribed period which is on the 10th day of the succeeding month. During the 
year, monthly remittance of withheld contributions and deductions totaled 
₱33,956,041.75, leaving a balance of ₱379,170.85 as at yearend. Details of 
monthly GSIS premium and loan deductions and remittance thereof are shown

15.4 The unremitted balance of the Due to GSIS account of ₱379,170.85 is attributed 

to the prior years’ and CY balances that remained unaccounted, whether these 
pertain to unremitted contributions/repayment of loans or balances which should 
be subjected to reconciliation and may result in adjustments. 

 
15.5 We recommended that Management require the Chief Accountant to 

analyze/determine the causes of the remaining balance of Due to GSIS as at 
year-end and account for unremitted contributions/repayment of loans and 
remit the same to GSIS, or make the adjustments, as necessary, to correct the 
account balance. 

 
15.6 The Management commented that the Accounting Division is simultaneously 

preparing analysis of the accounts for mandatory deductions (GSIS, HDMF, 
PHIC) from basic salary in coordination with HRDD which is in-charge of the 
payroll system. The reported problems/errors with the online GSIS system that 
started February 2020 until April 2020 wherein all remittances transactions were 
brought back to old system of GSIS is one that is being covered in the 
reconciliation because the basis of salaries was different already from the old  
vis-a-vis the new system. The Management will give an update once reconciliation 
is completed. 

 
Compliance with Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) Insurance Act 
 
16. For CY 2020, POEA complied with the required PhilHealth Premium share of 

employees and Government Share in accordance with the provisions of  
RA No. 7875. However, the Due to PhilHealth account balance of P80,559.87 as of 
December 31, 2020 includes PYs’ unaccounted balances, erroneous CY 2020 entries 
and adjustments recognized in the account, thus rendering the year-end account 
balance unreliable. 

  
16.1 Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the National Health Insurance Act 

of 2013 or RA No. 7875 provides the following: 
 

“Section 18. Payment of Premium Contributions 
 

a. The member’s monthly contribution shall be deducted and withheld 
automatically by the employer from the former’s salary, wage or earnings. The 
premium contributed shall be divided equally between the employer and the 



88 
 

employed. The employer’s counterpart shall not, in any manner, be charged to 
the employee.  

 
b. The monthly premium contribution of employed members shall be remitted by 

the employer on or before the date prescribed by the Corporation.”   
 

16.2 Pursuant to RA No. 7875, POEA withheld from the employees’ salaries the 
mandatory PhilHealth contributions for CY 2020 and promptly remitted the same 
to the PhilHealth. The employees’ withheld contributions of P2,569,369.66, 
employer’ share of ₱2,803,713.71, and the preceding year beginning unremitted 
balance which totaled to ₱5,450,383.22 were remitted during the year. The details 
of the monthly withholding and remittances to PhilHealth are shown below:

16.3 The Due to PhilHealth account has a balance of P80,559.87 as of  

December 31, 2020, which is attributed to the unremitted CY 2020 contributions 
and the PYs’ unaccounted balances carried forward as beginning balance in 
January 2020. The CY 2020 transactions recorded under the account are 
summarized as follows:

16.5 Due to aforementioned deficiencies, the accuracy of the reported Due to PhilHealth 

account balance of ₱80,559.87 as of December 31, 2020 could not be relied upon. 
 

16.6 We recommended that Management require the Chief Accountant to 
trace/analyze the details of the prior years’ balance of the Due to PhilHealth 
account and thereafter remit immediately or make the necessary adjustments 
as necessary to correct the account balance. 

 
16.7 The Management commented that the Accounting Division has already analyzed 

the Due to PhilHealth account for 2020 and JEVs were already prepared for those 
items confirmed to be for adjustment and with complete supporting documents. 
More so, the analysis of transactions for CYs 2016 to 2019 is still ongoing and the 
Accounting Division will submit an updated analysis of account. 

 
Compliance with RA No. 9679, Strengthening the Home Development Mutual fund (Pag-
IBIG)  
 
17. POEA Management complied with the required withholding deductions and 

remittance of Pag-IBIG Premium share of employees, Government Share, and 
Employee Loans Repayment/ Amortization in accordance with the provisions of RA 
No. 9679.  Moreover, the account balance as of December 31, 2020 of P10,791.97 is 
mostly attributed to the PYs unaccounted balances, and erroneous recording of CY 
2020 transactions, thus rendering the Due to Pag-IBIG account balance unreliable. 
Also, a difference of P220,561.58 was noted between the amount withheld as recorded 
per books and per schedule of contributions and remittances submitted by the 
Accounting Division. 

 
17.1 Rule VII of the IRR of RA No. 9679, An Act Further Strengthening the Home 

Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) and for Other Purposes dated July 21, 2009 
provides the following: 

 
“Section 2. Method of Collection and Payment 



90 
 

 
Monthly contributions of members to the Fund shall be collected 
through payroll deductions by their respective employers, who for 
this purpose shall act as agent both of the Fund and the member. 
xxx 

 
Section 3(a). Remittance of Collections.  

 
All employers shall remit to the Fund their contributions and the 
contributions of their covered employees as well as the latter’s loan 
amortizations or payments to the Fund, as provided for under 
Section 2 of this Rule, when applicable, within fifteen (15) days 
from the date the same were collected unless another period is 
previously agreed upon between the employer and the Fund, or 
within such periods as the Fund may prescribe otherwise.” 

 
17.2 Pursuant to RA No. 9679, POEA deducted the Pag-IBIG contributions and short-

term loan amortization from the salaries of employees, and remitted the same 
within the prescribed period. In CY 2020, total amount of ₱2,817,969.64 
representing HDMF contributions was withheld from the salaries of officials and 
employees, loan payments including government share. Remittances totaling 
₱2,814,869.64, which include part of beginning balance, were made in CY 2020 
thereby leaving an unremitted balance of P10,791.97. Details of the monthly 
deductions and the remittances including the employer’s share are shown in the 
table below;

17.3 The Due to Pag-IBIG account balance of P10,791.97 as of December 31, 2020 is 
attributed to the unremitted CY 2020 contributions and the PYs’ unaccounted 
balances carried forward as beginning balance in January 2020. The CY 2020 
transactions recorded under the account are summarized as follows:

17.5 Also, comparison made on the submitted schedule by the Accounting Division and 

the GL balance recorded per books amounting to P2,597,508.06 and 
P2,817,969.64, respectively, disclosed a difference of P220,461.58. Verification 
showed that the noted variance was due to the exclusion of Pag-IBIG Contributions 
- GS of P62,600.00 of REU and Employee Loans/Amortizations amounting to 
P157,861.58 in the balance reflected in the submitted schedule.  

 
17.6 Due to aforementioned deficiencies, the balance of the Due to Pag-IBIG account 

of ₱10,791.97 as of December 31, 2020 could not be relied upon. 
 

17.7 We recommended that Management require the Chief Accountant to: 
 

a. trace/analyze the details of the prior years’ balance of the Due to  
Pag-IBIG account and thereafter remit immediately or make the 
necessary adjustments as necessary to correct the account balance; and 
 

b. ensure that the balances reported in the submitted Schedules of 
Contributions and Remittances - Pag-IBIG is reconciled with the balance 
recorded per books/GL and to accordingly update/reconcile the variance 
noted. 



92 
 

17.8 The Management commented that the Accounting Division has already analyzed 
the Due to Pag-IBIG account for CYs 2016 to 2020. The analysis of the account 
showed that the reconciling items has to be adjusted or remitted. JEVs were already 
prepared for those items confirmed to be for adjustment and with complete 
supporting documents. The Management will update COA on the progress of 
analysis as we further work back on this account. 
 

17.9 The Management also ensured that the schedule of contribution and remittances 
attached to DVs are reconciled to the figures in the books/GL. It was during the 
consolidation in the annual report when some of the figures were missed. The 
Management assured that the Annual Schedule will be reconciled with the GL 
before submission. 

 
Gender and Development (GAD) 
 
18. The POEA formulated its GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) designed to address gender 

issues related to its mandate on overseas employment and services and allocated a 
GAD budget of P66,114,558.26 or 12.96 percent of its appropriations which met the 
minimum five percent allocation required in Section 31 of the General Provisions of 
the GAA for FY 2020. However, only 13 out of 20 target GAD outputs were 
accomplished due to the Pandemic wherein expenditures of P42,606,908.39 or 64 
percent were incurred out of its GAD Budget. 

 
18.1 Section 31 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA provides that all 

agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address 
gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the 
applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, 
the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive 
Development (1995-2025), and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).   

 
18.2 The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which 

shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. For this purpose, activities 
currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that 
contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of 
marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human 
rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance, are considered sufficient 
compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget shall be 
evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies. 
The preparation and submission of the annual GAD Plan and annual GAD 
Accomplishment Report shall be subject to the guidelines issued by the agencies 
concerned. 

 
18.3 Review of the PCW-endorsed POEA GPB to address gender issues/concerns for 

CY 2020 disclosed that the proposed budget amounting to P59,503,433.26 was 
11.67 percent of the P510,051,000.00 total appropriations of POEA for FY 2020, 



93 
 

which complied with the minimum requirement of five percent allocation 
attributed to Agency programs and activities.  

 
18.4 However, review of GAD Accomplishment Report of POEA for CY2020 

disclosed that two additional GAD activities with a budget of P6,611,125.00 were 
included in its program, thus raising the GPB to P66,114,558.26 or 12.96 percent 
of its appropriations. 

 
18.5 Despite the Pandemic, the Agency was able to accomplish 13 out of the 20 GAD 

planned activities as identified in their GPB while expending only P42,606,908.39 
or 64.44 percent of the total GAD Budget, as illustrated below:

non-implementation of the seven GAD activities was due to the Pandemic and in 
compliance with the provisions of DBM NBC No. 580 dated April 22, 2020 on 
Adoption of Economic Measures in the Government Due to the Emergency Health 
Situation. Relative thereto, the remaining seven 2020 GAD Activities - 
Organization Focused will be adopted for implementation in CY 2021.

more GAD-related programs, projects and activities that promote gender 
equality.  

 
18.8 The Management commented that with the foregoing events for the FY 2021 and 

Government’s regulation and implementation of quarantine protocols that still 
continue to prohibit face-to-face transactions, the Administration had foreseen that 
some PPAs under its GPB 2021 will still be affected by this regulation. However, 
the Management posited that POEA will continue to adhere to its mandate and 
implement PPAs related to GAD for the protection and welfare of their clients, 
most especially the OFWs.
