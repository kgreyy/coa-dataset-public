EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) was created in 

1982, through Executive Order (EO) No. 797, to manage the overseas employment 

program. From its inception in 1982, an EO and three Republic Acts (RAs) were 

issued, namely: EO No. 247 (1987), RA No. 8042, known as “The Migrant Workers 

and Overseas Filipino Act of 1995,” RA No. 9422 (2007) and RA No. 10022 (2010), 

all with the ultimate objective of establishing a high standard of protection and 

promotion of the welfare of migrant workers. 

 

As provided in the RAs, the POEA shall regulate private sector participation in 

the recruitment and overseas placement of workers by setting up a licensing and 

registration system. It shall also formulate and implement, in coordination with 

appropriate entities concerned, when necessary, a system for promoting and 

monitoring the overseas employment of Filipino workers taking into consideration 

their welfare and the domestic manpower requirement. It shall be responsible for the 

regulation and management of overseas employment from the pre-employment stage, 

securing the best possible employment terms and conditions for overseas Filipino 

workers, and taking into consideration the needs of vulnerable sectors and the 

peculiarities of Sea-Based (SB) and Land-Based (LB) workers. In appropriate cases, 

the Administration shall allow the lifting of suspension of erring recruitment/manning 

agencies upon the payment of fine of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) for every 

month of suspension.  

 

In addition to its powers and functions, the Administration shall inform migrant 

workers not only of their rights as workers but also of their rights as human beings, 

instruct and guide the workers how to assert their rights and provide the available 

mechanism to redress violation of their rights. It shall also be responsible for the 

implementation, in partnership with other law-enforcement agencies, of an intensified 

program against illegal recruitment activities. For this purpose, the POEA shall 

provide comprehensive Pre-Employment Orientation Seminars that will discuss topics 

such as prevention of illegal recruitment and gender-sensitivity.  

 

The Administration shall not engage in the recruitment and placement of 

overseas workers except on a government-to-government arrangement only. In the 

recruitment and placement of workers to service the requirements for trained and 

competent Filipino workers of foreign governments and their instrumentalities and 

such other employers as public interests may require, the Administration shall deploy 

only to countries where the Philippines has concluded bilateral labor agreements or 

arrangements provided that such countries shall guarantee to protect the rights of 

Filipino migrant workers and that such countries shall observe and/or comply with the 

international laws and standards for migrant workers.

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial transactions and operations of the POEA for the 

year ended December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of 

assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements 

(FS); (b) determine the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and 

regulations; and (c) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’(PYs’) audit 

recommendations.  

 

 

 



vii 
 

E. Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of 

the FS of the POEA for CY 2020 in view of total misstatements of P8,787,217.89 in 

Receivables, Financial Liabilities, Inter-agency Payables and Service Income accounts 

due to accounting errors and omissions, as stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report 

and as discussed in detail in Part II of this Report. 

 

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
  

Among the significant audit observations and recommendations, which are 

discussed in detail in Part II of this report, are as follows: 

 

a. The Agency’s Receivables, Financial Liabilities, Inter-Agency Payables and 
Service Income accounts were misstated by an aggregate amount of P8,787,217.89 

due to accounting errors and omissions, hence resulting in the unreliability of its 

financial statements (FSs) as at December 31, 2020. (Observation No. 1) 

 

Unrecorded DBM-PS deliveries, erroneous recording and unreconciled 2015 and 

PYs’ discrepancies 

 

We recommended that the POEA Management require: a) the Property 

Officer to forward to the Accounting Division promptly all pertinent 

documents pertaining to receipt of goods and issuances made thereto, 

particularly the deliveries made by Department of Budget and Management – 

Procurement Services (DBM-PS), for proper recording in the accounting 

books; b) the Chief Accountant and Property Officer to reconcile at least 

quarterly their respective records/reports to establish the correct balance of 

the reported deliveries made by DBM-PS and adjust them accordingly; c) the 

Chief Accountant to make adjustments in the books for the unrecorded 

current and prior year DBM-PS deliveries to establish the correct account 

balance; and d) the Chief Accountant to reconcile the Accounting books with 

DBM-PS books annually to establish the correct amounts of undelivered items 

and remaining balances; and henceforth, to immediately bring to the DBM-

PS attention the reconciling items determined for correction in their books. 

 

Non-recognition of collected income for the liquidated damages (LD) and 

erroneous recording of progress billings paid to the contractor 

 

We recommended that Management direct the Chief Accountant to: a) 

observe the proper recording of the progress payments of contracts previously 

set up as Accounts Payable following the prescribed entries in the Government 

Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs); and 

b) make the necessary adjusting entries to correct the error in recognizing 

income from LDs for CY 2020. 

 



viii 
 

Erroneous recording of remittance of penalties to the Bureau of Internal Revenue 

(BIR) 

 

We recommended that Management direct the Chief Accountant to make the 

necessary adjusting entries to correct the error in recording of remittances of 

penalties to the BIR. 

 

Erroneous recording of collections and income 

 

We recommended that the Management require the Chief Accountant to make 

adjustments as necessary, to take up the misstatements in the recorded 

Processing Fee and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account and to also take up 

the unrecorded interest income earned through the depository accounts and 

remit the same to the Bureau of the Treasury. 
 

b. The Cash in Bank – Local Currency Current Account (CIB – LCCA) account 
balance as of December 31, 2020 includes unaccounted PYs balances of 

P23,098,743.94 recorded from CYs 2016 to 2020 for which there were no 

subsidiary records nor necessary data/information to substantiate the beginning 

balance, hence, cast doubts on the propriety and reliability of the CIB-LCCA 

balance at year-end. (Observation No. 2) 

 

We recommended that the Management require the Accountant to exhaust 

efforts to locate the supporting documents to establish the propriety and 

reliability of the prior years’ balances of the account CIB-LCCA, and to 

reclassify the SLs to the appropriate fund source.  

 

c. Discrepancies of P63,598,694.12 were noted between the balances of the account 
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) as against the Report on the Physical Count 

of PPE (RPCPPE) due to: a) PPEs physically counted but not recorded totaling  

P11,249,081.03, b) recorded but not existing valued at P27,676,284.99, and c) some 

recorded value/costs in the books differ with the amounts in RPCPPEs by  

P47,171,490.16, aside from the unidentified items of Building, Other Equipment, 

and Other PPE recorded as part of beginning balances in the POEA books in CY 

2016 upon transition to e-NGAS and named as ‘For reconciliation’ with a net book 

value of P81,278,940.09,  hence cast doubt on the existence and completeness of 

recorded PPE and rendered the year-end balances unreliable. Furthermore, Property 

Cards were not properly maintained for all items of PPE. (Observation No. 6)  

 

We recommended that the Management require the: a) Chief Accountant and 

Property Officer to conduct at least semestral reconciliation of their respective 

Accounting records and Property records and reports; b) Chief Accountant to 

maintain PPELC to present the details of the PPE per account category 

instead of a lump sum basis, reconciled with the Property records and reports 

to support the controlling PPE account book balances and make adjusting 

entries to reflect the PPEs found existing but not recorded in the books of 



ix 
 

accounts; c) Property Officer to maintain and update PCs to account for the 

receipt and disposition of all items of PPE, come up with a strategic plan, 

which may involve support from other personnel and the concerned respective 

offices/end-users, for the conduct of complete annual physical count of all PPE, 

and submit the corresponding RPCPPE to concerned agency officials, and 

look into the whereabouts of the PPEs which were recorded in the books but 

not found at the time of PPE physical inventory. 

 

d. Out of the total balance of P15,282,887.07, P10,905,722.71 or 71.36 percent 
remained non-moving from six to 37 years in the following accounts; a) Accounts 

Receivable, b.) Due from NGAs, c.) Advances to Officers and Employees, d.) Due 

to Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs); and e.) Due to 

NGAs. Likewise, the receivables collectability is doubtful or nil due to absence of 

supporting records, rendering the validity of the said accounts doubtful. 

Management failed to conduct reconciliation and initiate request from the 

Commission on Audit to write-off the dormant accounts under COA Circular No. 

2016-005 dated December 9, 2016 and COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 

5, 1997. (Observation No. 7) 

 

We reiterated our prior years’ audit recommendations and further 

recommended that Management require the concerned agency officials to: a) 

submit the required documents to facilitate the approval of the requested 

write-off of dormant receivables amounting to P1,175,269.00 arising from 

employers’ unpaid processing fees;  b) adopt alternative measures to enforce 

the collection of the remaining dormant receivables including applicable legal 

action against the debtor foreign employers in coordination with the 

Philippine foreign offices in the countries of the employers;  c) exhaust efforts 

to locate the documents supporting the dormant unsettled advances of 

P107,567.41 recorded as Revolving Funds but without supporting details; d) 

reconcile the dormant Receivables and Liabilities accounts with the   

debtor/creditor government agencies to determine their validity; and e) if after 

all efforts to collect and determine validity of the dormant accounts prove 

futile, submit request for write-off of the accounts which became dormant for 

more than 10 years supported by the required documents and guided by the 

procedures in the write-off of dormant accounts as set forth in COA Circular 

No. 2016-005 dated December 9, 2016. 

 

e. The unutilized funds under Trust Liabilities amounting to P15,727,638.67 recorded 
under the CIB-LCCA intended to cover expenditures for Employment Permit 

System (EPS) – Test of Proficiency in Korean (TOPIK), EPS-Training Fees, CAEP 

and Pre-Licensing Orientation Seminar (PLOS) remained unremitted to the BTr as 

at December 31, 2020, contrary to the provisions provided in Sections 4 and 65 of 

PD No. 1445 that resulted in unrealized and unrecognized Miscellaneous Income 

accruing to the General Fund of the government (Observation No. 10) 

 



x 
 

We recommended that Management require: a) the concerned Officers to 

remit promptly to the BTr all unutilized trust funds for EPS-TOPIK, EPS-

Training Fees, CAEP and PLOS and henceforth, require strict adherence to 

the provisions stated in Section 65 of PD No. 1445; and b) the Accountant to 

make the necessary entries to recognize the unutilized funds as income upon 

remittance to the BTr. 

 

The aforementioned audit observations and recommendations were discussed 

with Agency Officials in an Exit Conference conducted on June 1, 2021 and their 

comments were included in this Report, where appropriate. 

 

G. Status of Settlement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 
 

The total unsettled audit suspensions and disallowances as of December 31, 2020 

amounted to ₱15,000.00 and ₱10,130,407.39, respectively.  

 

H. Status of Implementation of PYs’ Audit Recommendations 
 

Of the 66 audit recommendations contained in the 2019 Annual Audit Report, 

21 were fully implemented and 45 were not implemented. The details of the prior 

years’ recommendations are presented in Part III of this Report. 

 

Status No. of Recommendations Percentage
