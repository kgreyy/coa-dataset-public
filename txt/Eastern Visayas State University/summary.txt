EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)	Introduction



	The Eastern Visayas State University (EVSU) started in 1907 as part of the Provincial School and became a separate educational entity in 1915 with the name Leyte Trade School.



Since then, the school underwent several changes to adapt to its curricular area coverage.  In 1965, by virtue of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 4572, it became a chartered college under the name Leyte Institute of Technology (LIT), an institute of higher learning committed to the service of a larger academic area of responsibility.



In 2004, by virtue of R.A. No. 9311, s. of 2004, the Leyte Institute of Technology became a university and is now known as the Eastern Visayas State University (EVSU), an institution committed to the service of a larger area of responsibility through academic excellence and technological development.  It has added new programs to meet the demands of the labor sector here and abroad.



The EVSU Main Campus is located at Brgy. 43, Quarry District, Tacloban City, and has four integrated Commission on Higher Education (CHED)-Supervised Institutions (CSIs) located in the municipalities of Burauen, Tanauan, Carigara, and in Ormoc City.



The audit covers the review of accounts and operations of EVSU for Calendar Year (CY) 2020.  The audit was conducted to:  a) ascertain the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and regulations; b) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the management’s assertions on the financial statements; and c) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.

C)	Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered an adverse opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of EVSU for CY 2020 due to the materiality of the errors/deficiencies noted in the audit of accounts as stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report and discussed in detail in Part II of this Report, as follows:



a)   inaccurate and unreliable year-end balances of the following accounts:

6)	Advances for Operating Expenses, Advances for Payroll, Advances to Special Disbursing Officers, Advances to Officers and Employees aggregating ₱27,319,043.49 due to abnormal balances, errors in recording, and unsubstantiated unliquidated cash advance balances amounting to ₱4,572,248.76, ₱5,984,527.60, and ₱1,139,077.36, respectively;

c)   Honoraria-Civilian with year-end balance of ₱54,261,798.97 was misstated due to erroneous recording to the account of the salary differential of EVSU-Main Campus employees amounting ₱3,232,778.00.





D)	Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



The following are the significant audit observations and recommendations which are discussed in detail in Part II of this Report:



1)		The Financial Statements, Trial Balances, Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS), and their supporting schedules CY 2020 were not submitted to the Audit Team within the reglementary period of submission, contrary to Section 122 of PD No. 1445; Section 7.2.1 (a) of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009; Sections 48 and 60 of Chapter 19, and Section 7 of Chapter 21, of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.



	We recommend that the University President: 



	a.	require the Director of Finance Services, and the University Accountant to submit immediately to the Audit Team, the Financial Statements, Trial Balance, BRS and their supporting documents for CY 2020; and



b.	take appropriate action, against officials and employees concerned for the repeated failure to adhere to the provisions of the aforecited laws, rules and regulations; withhold the payment of salaries of officials/personnel responsible for the failure to submit the documents and reports mentioned herein until they shall have complied with the requirements of COA pursuant to Section 122(2) of PD No. 1445. 1445.



2)		Unexpended fund of the Tanauan, Burauen, Ormoc and Carigara campuses in the aggregate amount of ₱1,262,420.73 was not remitted to National Treasury which has resulted in the accumulation of the cash balances in their respective Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account, contrary to Paragraph 3.4.5 of the National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated January 6, 2020.



We recommended that the President instructs the Cashiers and the Accountants of the external campuses to: 



a.  remit the unused fund in the amount of ₱1,262,420.73 to the National Treasury, and to refrain from keeping unexpended allotments in the Other Receivables and Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account in accordance with laws, rules and regulations; and 



b.  make the necessary adjusting entries upon remittance to the National Treasury, and submit the JEV supported with evidentiary documents to the Audit Team for verification.



3)		Payments for Honoraria of the Board of Regents (BOR) of the EVSU-Main Campus, Tacloban City, for CYs 2019 and 2020 amounting to ₱440,075.00.00, were charged against the IGF, contrary to Item 6.0 of the NBC No.  2007-510 dated May 8, 2007 and Section 4(d) of RA No. 8292, thereby depleting the IGF of the University.



We recommended that the University President require the Budget Officer to strictly adhere to the provisions of Item 6.0 of the NBC No. 2007-510 dated May 8, 2007 and Section 4 (d) of RA No. 8292, and stop the practice of charging payments of honoraria to the Board of Regents against the IGF so as not to deplete this fund.



4)		The recoupment of advance payments to contractor for mobilization and the deduction of 10% retention money were not imposed on the progress billing payments for projects at EVSU Carigara and EVSU Ormoc, in violation of paragraphs 4.3 and 6.1, Annex E of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184.



We recommended that the University President direct the Accountants of the various EVSU campuses to:



a)	compute for unrecouped advances amounting to ₱276,759.59, and the 10% retention of ₱184,501.80 in the next progress payments for the construction of two-storey Information Technology Building (Phase I) at EVSU Carigara;



b)	make the necessary adjustments in the books of EVSU Carigara for the unrecorded retention money amounting to ₱105,782.48; 



c)	carefully review the journal entries before posting to the general ledgers and strictly implement the rules and regulations provided for under the GAM for NGAs to ensure that balances and accounts are presented fairly in the financial statements of the University; and



d)	henceforth, strictly adhere to the provisions of RA No. 9184 particularly on advance payments and retention money to ensure the recoupment of the advances made to contractors and the coverage/recovery for uncorrected discovered defects and third-party liabilities that may arise during the implementation of the project for which the retention money is intended.



5)		Cash donation received by EVSU Burauen Campus amounting to ₱100,000.00 was not acknowledged with an official receipt, hence not recorded in the books of the campus, contrary to Section 63 of the PD No. 1445.  Consequently, equipment procured out of the donated funds were likewise not recorded in the books, thereby understating the Inventory accounts of EVSU Burauen Campus.



We recommended that the University President require the Accountant and Property Management Officer of Burauen Campus to:



a)	prepare a JEV to record in the books of Burauen Campus the various equipment and the other expenses in the amount of ₱75,939.50 and ₱24,060.50, respectively, and submit to COA copy of the JEV for audit.



b)	post in the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) and the Property Card the various equipment procured.



c)	Thereafter, issue official receipts to acknowledge all moneys received as donation so that these are recognized as part of government funds.



The above audit observations and recommendations were communicated to management through Audit Observation Memoranda (AOMs).
