Dear Dr. De Vera and Dr. Tanggol,

	

We are pleased to transmit the Annual Audit Report (AAR) on the audit of the Mindanao State University – Iligan Institute of Technology, Iligan City, for the Calendar Year 2020 in compliance with Section 2, Article IX-D of the Philippine Constitution and Section 43 of Presidential Decree No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines.



The audit was conducted to (a) ascertain the degree of reliance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.



The audit report consists of Part I – Audited Financial Statements, Part II – Audit Observations and Recommendations, Part III – Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations, which were discussed with the officials and staff concerned, and Part IV – Appendices.



We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs) and we believed that it provided a reasonable basis for the audit results.



The Auditor rendered a modified-qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the University due to the following: 



1)	The accuracy and validity of the balance of the Cash in Bank account for seven (7) bank accounts as of October 12, 2020, could not be relied upon due to the existence of bulk  unreconciled items between the Bank Statements and the Check and Advice to Debit Disbursements Records (CkADADRecs), between the Bank Statements and the Subsidiary Ledgers, and the CkADADRecs and the Subsidiary Ledgers amounting to ₱175,674,093.85, ₱151,261,120.06, and ₱212,161,954.39, respectively, arising from the non-preparation of the monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS), as required under Section 74 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume 1.

 

2)	Accounts Receivable totaling P49,057,475.20 is unreliable and doubtful due to a) unavailable  supporting records/documents to explain their existence/establishment, b)  balances that remained non- moving for five consecutive years or more, c) unreconciled inter-agency transactions, d) Unadjusted balances in transferring of fund to another fund, and   d) provision of non- moving Impairment Loss-Accounts Receivables  for consecutive six years,   contrary  to Section 27 of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSASs), Section 15, Chapter 2  and Section 9, Chapter 3  of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs)  and Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) 1445, thus, impairing the accuracy and correctness of the balances of Receivable Accounts and the corresponding revenue accounts  in the Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020.



The details of the above and other findings and recommendations were discussed by the Audit Team with you and other officials in an exit conference on February 16, 2021 are discussed in detail on Part II of the report.



We request that the recommended measures be implemented and we would appreciate being informed on the actions taken thereon by accomplishing the attached Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation (AAPSI) form, to be submitted to the Audit Team within 60 days from receipt of this report, pursuant to Section 89 of RA 11465, the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act for FY 2020.

AAR #1

The accuracy and validity of the balance of the Cash in Bank account for seven (7) bank accounts as of October 12, 2020, could not be relied upon due to the existence of bulk  unreconciled items between the Bank Statements and the Check and Advice to Debit Disbursements Records (CkADADRecs), between the Bank Statements and the Subsidiary Ledgers, and the CkADADRecs and the Subsidiary Ledgers amounting to ₱175,674,093.85, ₱151,261,120.06, and ₱212,161,954.39, respectively, arising from the non-preparation of the monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS), as required under Section 74 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume 1.



We recommended that management to demand from its personnel who is/are in charge of the preparation of BRS to prepare and submit the bank reconciliation statements until the month of October 2020, and until then, to withhold the salaries of these personnel. Furthermore, Management should inform these personnel of the importance of reconciliation of records and instruct them to abide by the provisions mandating the timely submission of BRS.















AAR #2

Due to weak internal control, various unrecorded deposits and interest income totaling to P12,534,506.85 and P15,540,915.49 in the Check and ADA Disbursements Records and the Subsidiary Ledgers, respectively, as well as unconsidered numerous disbursements and tax remittances totaling to P101,925.47 and P798,662.54, in their respective books, affecting the accuracy and reliability of the Cash-In Bank (CIB) account and a result of deviation from the procedures of recording financial items laid down in the Government Accounting Manual.

		We recommended that Management to make the necessary correction cited above and instruct its accountable officers and the Accounting personnel to follow the steps discussed in this memorandum to ensure that recording of cash and other liquid assets are properly made. Further, we recommended that internal control be assessed so that lapses and loopholes be detected and corrected. 



















AAR #3

The accuracy and existence of the balance of the cash in Bank Account as of September 30, 2020 could not be ascertained due to the non-preparation/non-submission of the monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) as required under Section 74 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume 1.



We recommended the Management to demand from its personnel who is/are in charge of the preparation of BRS to prepare and submit the bank reconciliation statements of the month of January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, and September 2020, and until then, to withhold the salaries of these personnel. Furthermore, Management should instruct the personnel to abide by the provisions mandating the timely submission of BRS. 

	



















AAR #4

Receivable Accounts totaling P49,057,475.20 is unreliable and doubtful due to a) Unavailable  supporting records/documents to explain their existence/establishment, b)  Balances that remained non- moving for five consecutive years or more, c) Unreconciled inter-agency transactions, d) Unadjusted balances in transferring of fund to another fund, and   d) Provision of non- moving Impairment Loss-Accounts Receivables  for consecutive six years,   contrary  to Section 27 of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSASs), Section 15, Chapter 2  and Section 9, Chapter 3  of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs)  and Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) 1445, thus, impairing the accuracy and correctness of the balances of Receivable Accounts and the corresponding revenue accounts  in the Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020.





We recommended   to management the following courses of actions:



1)	Exert efforts to retrieve the documents in support to the existence of the receivable accounts, otherwise, evaluate the dormant accounts and comply with all the conditions and requirements of COA Circular 2016 – 005 dated December 19, 2016 for the request for write-off;



2)	Reconcile properly with the GSIS for the alleged under remittance of the premiums due as of October 30, 2020 in the amount of  Php  95,788,027.76 and if warranted, remit immediately the amount due to refrain from further accrual of interest to avoid  adverse effect on the concerned  employees, as well as to prevent the filing of administrative, criminal and collection cases against the institute;



3)	Effect the adjusting entry to close the transfer of account from Fund 05 to Fund 07 in the amount of P78,000.00; and 



4)	Properly evaluate the recognized Impairment Loss amounting to P12,751.40 which remained non-moving since December 2014 in order present fairly the Financial Statements of the agency.

















AAR #5

Student Assistance Fund for Education (SAFE) for Loan to students granted by the Commission on Higher Education( CHED) last April 2010 has an unutilized balance of P1,443,000.00 representing 72.15% of the P2,000,000.00 given, thus, defeating the purpose of the program and the would be benefits that the students could have derived from that program.



We recommended that management should enforce immediately the terms and conditions set under the Contract of Loan which provides that if the principal debtor/borrower fails to pay the amount granted on the date stipulated therein, then the amount due shall be deducted from the payroll of the Co-makerat Five Hundred Pesos (P500.00) per month until fully paid which deduction does not need any notice or demand to the principal debtor or to the Co-maker. Moreover, the DSA office should reconcile with the Accounting Office to come up with the correct outstanding balance of loans. 



We recommended further, that the balance of  P1,443,000.00 should be returned to the funding agency since the sustainability and efficiency of the program were not attained and assured.

	

















AAR #6

Management is very lax in enforcing agreement to render return service by a number of faculty members granted with Fellowship Awards with the unpaid expenditures of  P10,415,519.26 as of November 30, 2020 for their Study Grants which is not consistent with the Guidelines for Faculty Development Program (FDP) /Academic Personnel Development Program (APDP) and in violation of the Fellowship Agreement Contract executed and entered into by the institute and the grantee,  thus, defeating the  purpose and objectives of the program and the maximum benefits that could have been  derived therefrom were not realized.







We recommended to management the following:



a)	Enforce strictly the terms and conditions set forth under the Fellowship Agreement Contract and that payment of the two reneging fellows on installment basis should not have been allowed as it was a breach of the Contract. It also became a precedence whereby the grantees would not be forced or obliged to return service to the institute after the study grant;



b)	File administrative and legal charges against the aforementioned reneging fellows who were granted with the Study Grants in the Academic Year period since 1992 to present immediately,  if warranted;



c)	Execute the terms and conditions stipulated in the Surety Agreement;  



d)	Require the Academic Panel to strictly screen the applicants or nominees for the APDP or FDP to avoid the same circumstances and  to protect the interest of the institute; and



e)	Require the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs to file properly and completely all supporting documents in relation to the Grantees’ Fellowship Awards  including the Office who facilitated and administered the implementation of Faculty Development Program (FDP) /Academic Personnel Development Program (APDP) for monitoring purposes.

















AAR #7

Non-submission of complete supporting documents for six (6) major projects with an aggregate cost of P 160,329,578.85 is violation to COA Circular No. 2009-01 dated February 12, 2009 and COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 thus, prevented the auditor to undertake auditorial and legal review necessary for generating timely and relevant audit results and also, cast doubts on the regularity of the payment of the transactions.



We recommended to management to:

a)	Submit immediately the lacking supporting documents as stated in our letter dated December 11, 2019 per Annex B;



b)	Submit the documentary requirements as provided in COA Circular 2012-001 for the payment transactions for the six(6) projects and submit the documents as provided in Annex B of  COA Memo No. 2005-006 dated Feb. 28, 2005  for the changes in the initial contract project costs; and



c)	Concerned personnel must revisit the pertinent rules and regulations such as COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009,  Item 9.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and COA Memorandum No. 2005-027 dated Feb. 28, 2005.

















2019 AAR















AAR # 1

The reported balance of  Construction in Progress account amounting to P605,076,647.61 as of December 31, 2019 is inconsistent  to Chapter 10, Section 8(g) and Section 27(c) of Government Accounting  Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies,  Volume I dated January 24, 2014  thus,  impairing the accuracy and reliability of the Financial Statements.

We recommended that the Accountant should reclassify the completed and turned-over projects which were taken up in the books under Construction in Progress account to appropriate asset account. Also, the corresponding depreciation should be recognized and recorded in the books of accounts and the CIPLC shall be kept in the Accounting Division for each project.



We recommended further that Physical Plant Division Office should submit promptly the required pertinent documents upon completion of the constructed projects to the Accounting Office for proper recording thereof.















AAR # 2

1)	Non-preparation of Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) for two (2) bank accounts is inconsistent with Section 5 of Chapter 21, Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I, thus, differences of records in both the concerned accountable officer and the banks have not been corrected.

2)	Unrecorded long outstanding bank reconciling items under the cash account is inconsistent with  Section 6, Chapter 21 of GAM Volume I, thus, impairing the fair presentation of Cash in Bank and other related accounts balance at a given reporting period.

3)	Delayed submission of BRS is inconsistent with Chapter 21 of GAM Volume I thus; correction of differences of records in the banks and in the books of accounts could not be done promptly. 

4)		Non-recording of daily collections by the accounting office to Cash Collecting Officer Account for fund 05 (Business Related Funds) for the period September 9, 2017 to October 11, 2018 amounting to P1,217,550.45 is in violation of Section 1, Chapter III,   Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume III. Thus, accountability of the collecting officer could not be ascertained promptly at a given time.

1)	We recommended that the Accounting Office should prepare and submit to the Office of the Auditor the corresponding BRSs for the two (2) bank accounts (0324-0056-41 and 0321-2333-68) for the months of August 2018 to present.

2)	We recommended the Cashier and the Accounting Division to effect all reconciling items to present fairly the Cash in Bank and other related accounts balance at every reporting period.

3)	We recommended that the Accounting Division should maintain a record to show the date of receipt of Bank Statements or stamp the date of receipt on the face of bank statement to monitor properly the preparation and timely submission of BRS.

4)	We recommended that the accounting division must record daily collections from fund 05 to Cash Collecting Officer account.















AAR # 4

The actual operational timelines of 77 to 309 days for the procurement of Goods and Services/Infrastructure Projects through Public Bidding of Shopping were not in consonance with the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Procurement Law (RA 9184) thereby showing inefficient Procurement System of the institute, thus, its general operations may be hampered and the attainment of its objectives also may hardly be achieved.

We recommended the Management to:



a)	Adhere strictly to the operational timelines for each procurement activity as provided in the Annex C of the 2016 Revised IRR of Republic Act 9184.



b)	Avoid the different causes of delay in every phase of the procurement activities of institute such as not stating clearly the specifications on the PR, longtime preparation of RFQ upon completion of the PR, longtime serving of the PO to the winning supplier and other causes as mentioned above.















AAR # 5

The submission of the monthly/quarterly financial statements/reports and related supporting documents/schedules were delayed from 7 days to 279 calendar days, contrary to Section 60, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), and Executive Order (EO) No. 292 series of 1997, and reiterated under Section 5.5.b of COA Circular No. 2015-002, thus hindered the timely audit of the transactions and in case of noted deficiencies as the case maybe, prompt corrections thereof could not be made.

	We recommended the Management to:

	

	a) Instruct the Accountant to strictly comply with existing COA rules and regulations on the timely submission of the required financial statements/reports and its related schedules and supporting documents to the Audit Team; and

	

	b)  Advise the Accountant to employ strategies to comply with the audit requirements despite of personnel constraints. If deemed necessary, withholding of the salaries of concerned officials should be imposed thereof if continuous failure of timely submission of financial and accounting reports until it would be complied with pursuant to  Section 122 (2) of PD 1445.



















AAR # 6

Under Remittance of the Premiums and Loan Repayments due to Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) in the aggregate amounts of P 550,227.74 and P 111,252.53, respectively is contrary to Section 14 of Republic Act (RA) 8291, GSIS Act of 1997, thus, depriving the concerned officials and employees of the maximum benefits and privileges that they would have received and entitled to.

We recommended the Management the following:



1)   Monthly payment or remittance in full for the due premiums and loan repayments should be made. In the event of unpaid balance for a given month, payment in the succeeding month should be made to avoid penalty or interest of 2% of the total premium obligation for every month of delayed remittance;



2)  Reconcile the records with the GSIS on the amounts for the due premiums and loan repayments as well as the amounts remitted for June 2019 and the rests of the month to come up with the same  unpaid balance as of June 30, 2019 and onward;





3)   Require the AAO to update promptly the profile of all employees of the institute to arrive at the correct computation of premiums due to GSIS every month and thereafter remit the same to them; and



4)  Require the AAO to coordinate with the ERF Officer on the timely deduction of the monthly amortization due on the loans certified or approved.

















2018 AAR















AAR # 1

Donated Properties, Plant and Equipment (PPE) amounting to P24.126 million were not booked up in the books contrary to Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) 1145, thereby, understating the balances of the PPE accounts which impaired the accuracy and correctness of the same in the Financial Statements as of February 28, 2018.

We recommended the management to establish clearly the true ownership of the different donated properties per Physical Inventory Report of the Supply & Management Division and thereafter record them as part of the PPE in the books of accounts.















AAR # 2

Deficiencies and revisions in the pre-design plans of the infrastructure project– Design and Build College of Arts and Social Sciences (CASS) Building with a contract cost of P108.889 million resulted in the delayed implementation of the project, thereby defeating the purpose of implementing infrastructure projects thru design and build scheme, as provided in Appendix G of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A 9184 and depriving the public of the benefits that could have been derived from its immediate use.

We recommended that Management:

a)			Facilitate the immediate review and approval of the revised Detailed Design Plans in order to prevent the recurrence of the delay in the implementation of the project for the same reason; 

b)			Ensure the immediate actual implementation and completion of the project. Otherwise, appropriate sanctions on the contractor if he is at fault should be imposed thereof, like blacklisting or rescindment of the contract if it warrants or imposition of liquidated damages;

c)			Monitor and supervise thoroughly the implementation of the project just in case Changes like Time Extension or Variation Order are justified and approved to ensure completion in accordance with the terms and conditions stipulated in the contract; 

















AAR # 4

Subsidiary Ledger (SL) for Cash in Bank Account for each specific program/project was not maintained in accordance with the sound accounting system thus, its cash in bank balances could not be promptly determined. 



We recommended management to require the Accounting the establishment of Cash in Bank Subsidiary Ledger Account for each program or project implemented by the institute in the computerized books of accounts to keep track easily its respective running balances. This facilitates also our verification of balances on the submitted Financial Reports and would minimize or prevent occurrence of unreconciled balances in the same reports and in the electronic records. This further expedites the preparation of the Liquidation/Financial Reports of the institute to be submitted to its respective funding agency like DOST, CHED and others.















AAR # 6

The Payment of monthly retainer’s fee of P40,000.00 to the deputized Legal Counsel of the institute for the period January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 has no legal basis thereby rendering the transactions excessive.

We recommended the management to refund the payments made in excess thereof for the contract period January 1, 2018 to Dec. 31, 2018.















AAR # 8

Tarpaulin Signboards for infrastructure projects were not posted or displayed in the project location contrary to COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 2013, thereby restraining public participation in the promotion of good governance through transparency and accountability.

We recommended that management:

a)	At the beginning of the year, provide the assigned SA and ATL with a list of all on-going government PPA and those that are to be implemented during the year;



b)	Direct the Project Engineers to check/monitor the agency/contractor’s proper installation of signboards/notices of implemented PPA;



c)	Inform the audit team within ten (10) days after the award of the infrastructure project or before the start of the program/activity that the appropriate project signboards and/or public notices are already posted in order for the audit team to validate the same; and



d)	Post the sign boards and/or public notices in the project location as soon as the award of project has been made.

















2017 AAR















AAR # 4

The accuracy and reliability  of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts amounting to P855,846,256.11 could not be ascertained due to the discrepancies noted as against the balance of P721,044,670.28 per Physical Inventory Report contrary to Sections 74 of PD 1445, Section 4.3 of COA Circular No. 97-005 dated July 10, 1997 and Section 42, Chapter 10, of the Government Accounting Manual, Volume I, thus, affecting the fair presentation  of the  PPE accounts  in the Trial Balance  as of  December 31, 2016.



We recommended the following courses of actions:

a)	Correct/Adjust the errors in RPCPPE or Accounting Division, then investigate and reconcile immediately the discrepancies between the balances reflected in the RPCPPE and the books of accounts.

b)	Require the Accountant to maintain and update the PPELC and the Supply and Property officer to maintain and update also the PC as well as the PARs, and conduct regular reconciliation with each office’s records. The balance per PPELC should always reconcile with the PC of the Supply and Property Management Division.

c)	Require the use of the RPCPPE prescribed under Government Accounting Manual, Volume 1.















AAR # 5

Review and evaluation of the Trust Fund Accounts of the Institute as of September 30, 2017 revealed the following deficiencies/errors:

a)	There are Trust Fund Accounts balances that remained non- moving for five consecutive years or more and also, there are other accounts that remained in the books which are no longer necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which said funds were established, contrary to COA Circular 97-001 dated February 5, 1997 and Joint Circular No. 4-2012  dated September 11, 2012 of  Department of Finance, Department of Budget and Management and Commission On Audit;

b)	An aggregate unutilized balance of P5,005,971.89 for some completed  Programs/ Projects which are not remitted to their respective funding agency until to date and remained in the  books for one  year or more,  contrary to the Terms and Conditions provided in the Memorandum of Agreement; and

c)	Three (3) Checking Accounts maintained within One Hundred Twelve (112) Trust Fund Accounts is not in accordance with the Sound Accounting System.

We recommended to the management the following:

a)	The total balance of  P712,863.18 for the nine(9) dormant trust fund accounts and the total balance of P4,078,267.00 consisting of fifteen(15) Trust Fund Accounts which are inactive for 2 to 4 years and could not be explained/specified by the Accounting Division as to its continued existence or they are no longer necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which the said funds were established, should be closed and remitted to the Bureau of  Treasury.

b)	The aggregate unutilized balance as of Sept. 30, 2017 of P5,005,971.89 for the completed Ten(10) Programs/Projects should be returned to its respective funding agency without valid obligations.

c)	Submit copies of remittance slips for the above three (3) recommendations to the Auditor for monitoring purposes.



















2013 AAR















AAR # 1

Laxity of management to settle long outstanding cash advances from prior years in violation of COA Circular 97-002 and 2012-004 affected the accuracy in the presentation of cash and expense accounts.

We have recommended to:

•	Comply strictly with COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 on the grant and prescribed period of liquidation of cash advances.

•	Analyze and reconcile negative or abnormal balances and request for write off for those dormant accounts of deceased employees.

•	Cause the suspension of salaries of employees concerned until cash advances from previous years were fully liquidated.















AAR# 3

Funds from other national government agencies amounting to P1,913,104.35 remained in the Institute for several years in violation of COA Circular No. 94-013 thereby, depriving the source agency to utilize the funds in other government programs.

We have recommended to:

•	Direct the various Project Coordinators to submit status of projects in order to formally establish the termination of the project. If projects are completed, require a copy of terminal reports as proof and facilitate the immediate return of the excess funds to the source agency so that it can be utilized in other government programs.

•	Coordinate with MSU Main relative to the proper turnover of the College of Medicine funds still in the Institute. This deprived the other qualified University to utilize the unused fund in the previous years.















AAR # 5

Grant of CNA Incentive to Institute officials and employees was found to be excessive in violation of Section 7.1.2 DBM Budget Circular No. 2013-4 dated Nov. 25, 2013 due to noncompliance with the prescribed guidelines on the utilization of savings from which the incentive shall be sourced.

We have recommended to Comply strictly with DBM Budget Circular No. 2013-4 and to refund the excess amount of CNA granted.

Agency Background

The history of the Institute goes way back to 1946 with the establishment of the Iligan City National High School (ICHS). In 1956, the ICHS was converted into the Lanao Technical School (LTS) under the Bureau of Vocational Education (BEV). In 1965, Republic Act No. 4626 converted LTS into the Northern Mindanao Institute of Technology (NMIT). However, this law was not implemented. On July 12, 1968, Republic Act No. 5363 integrated LTS into the MSU System. During the 62nd Meeting of the MSU Board of Regents on March 12, 1975, the first comprehensive reorganizational plan of the Institute was approved under BOR Resolution No. 894, Series of 1975. This plan made the Institute the first autonomous unit of the MSU System. In the years that followed, Mindanao State University – Iligan Institute of Technology continually expanded and developed its academic programs while enhancing its research, infrastructure, and cultural activities.

	The Mindanao State University – Iligan Institute of Technology in Iligan City, Lanao del Norte, Mindanao is one of the ten campuses of the Mindanao State University System. Its mandate is to provide a program for an effective manpower training urgently needed for the industrial and commercial development in Mindanao. Its vision is to be a world-class institution of higher learning renowned for its excellence in Science and Technology and for its commitment to the holistic development of the individual and society. Its mission is to provide quality education for the industrial and socio-economic development of Mindanao with its diverse cultures through relevant programs in instruction, research, extension, and community involvement.

A)			INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



The auditor rendered a modified-qualified  opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements for the year then ended due to the effects of observations on the accuracy and validity of the balance of the Cash in Bank account for seven (7) bank accounts as of October 12, 2020, which could not be relied upon due to the existence of bulk  unreconciled items between the Bank Statements and the Check and Advice to Debit Disbursements Records (CkADADRecs), between the Bank Statements and the Subsidiary Ledgers, and the CkADADRecs and the Subsidiary Ledgers amounting to ₱175,674,093.85, ₱151,261,120.06, and ₱212,161,954.39, respectively, arising from the non-preparation of the monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS), as required under Section 74 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume 1; and Receivable Accounts totaling P49,057,475.20 is unreliable and doubtful due to a) unavailable  supporting records/documents to explain their existence/establishment, b)  balances that remained non- moving for five consecutive years or more, c) unreconciled inter-agency transactions, d) Unadjusted balances in transferring of fund to another fund, and   d) provision of non- moving Impairment Loss-Accounts Receivables  for consecutive six years,   contrary  to Section 27 of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSASs), Section 15, Chapter 2  and Section 9, Chapter 3  of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs)  and Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) 1445, thus, impairing the accuracy and correctness of the balances of Receivable Accounts and the corresponding revenue accounts  in the Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020.



B)	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMNEDATIONS



In addition, the following is a summary of significant observations and recommendations in the audit and/or evaluation of the operation of the university which needs immediate action.  These and other audit observations and recommendations are fully discussed in Part II of the report and were discussed by the Audit Team with you and other officials in an exit conference on February 16, 2021.



			1)		Due to weak internal control, various unrecorded deposits and interest income totaling P12,534,506.85 and P15,540,915.49 in the Check and ADA Disbursements Records and the Subsidiary Ledgers, respectively, as well as unconsidered numerous disbursements and tax remittances totaling to P101,925.47 and P798,662.54, in their respective books, affected the accuracy and reliability of the Cash-In Bank (CIB) account and resulted in the deviation from the procedures of recording financial items laid down in the Government Accounting Manual. 



We recommended that Management make the necessary corrections cited above and instruct its accountable officers and the Accounting personnel to follow the steps discussed in this memorandum to ensure that recording of cash and other liquid assets are properly made. Further, we recommended that internal control be assessed so that lapses and loopholes be detected and corrected.



			2)		The accuracy and existence of the balance of the cash in Bank Account as of September 30, 2020 could not be ascertained due to the non-preaparation/non-submission of the monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) as required under Section 74 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume 1.

	

	We recommended that management demand from its personnel who is/are in charge of the preparation of BRS to prepare and submit the bank reconciliation statements of the month of January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, and September 2020, and until then, to withhold the salaries of these personnel. Furthermore, Management should instruct the personnel to abide by the provisions mandating the timely submission of BRS.

	

			3)		The Student Assistance Fund for Education (SAFE) for Loan to students granted by the Commission on Higher Education( CHED) last April 2010 has an unutilized balance of P1,443,000.00 representing 72.15% of the P2,000,000.00 given, thus, defeating the purpose of the program and the would be benefits that the students could have derived from that program.

	

	We recommended that management should enforce immediately the terms and conditions set under the Contract of Loan which provides that if the principal debtor/borrower fails to pay the amount granted on the date stipulated therein, then the amount due shall be deducted from the payroll of the Co-maker at Five Hundred Pesos (P500.00) per month until fully paid which deduction does not need any notice or demand to the principal debtor or to the Co-maker. Moreover, the DSA office should reconcile with the Accounting Office to come up with the correct outstanding balance of loans. 

	

	We recommended further, that the balance of P1,443,000.00 should be returned to the funding agency since the sustainability and efficiency of the program were not attained and assured.

	

			4)		The Agency failed to submit complete supporting documents for six (6) major projects with an aggregate cost of P 160,329,578.85 in violation to COA Circular No. 2009-01 dated February 12, 2009 and COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 thus, prevented the auditor to undertake auditorial and legal review necessary for generating timely and relevant audit results and also, cast doubts on the regularity of the payment of the transactions.

	

	We recommended that Management: (a) submit immediately the lacking supporting documents as stated in our letter dated December 11, 2019 per Annex B; (b) submit the documentary requirements as provided in COA Circular 2012-001 for the payment transactions for the six (6) projects and submit the documents as provided in Annex B of  COA Memo No. 2005-006 dated Feb. 28, 2005  for the changes in the initial contract project costs; and (c) concerned personnel must revisit the pertinent rules and regulations such as COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, Item 9.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and COA Memorandum No. 2005-027 dated Feb. 28, 2005..

	

			5)		Management is very lax in enforcing agreement to render return service by a number of faculty members granted with Fellowship Awards with the unpaid expenditures of  P10,415,519.26 as of November 30, 2020 for their Study Grants which is not consistent with the Guidelines for Faculty Development Program (FDP) /Academic Personnel Development Program (APDP) and in violation of the Fellowship Agreement Contract executed and entered into by the institute and the grantee,  thus, defeating the  purpose and objectives of the program and the maximum benefits that could have been  derived therefrom were not realized.

	

	We recommended that Management: (a)  enforce strictly the terms and conditions set forth under the Fellowship Agreement Contract and that payment of the two reneging fellows on installment basis should not have been allowed as it was a breach of the Contract which may become a precedence whereby the grantees would not be forced or obliged to return service to the institute after the study grant; (b)  file administrative and legal charges against the reneging fellows who were granted with the Study Grants in the Academic Year period since 1992 to present immediately,  if warranted; (c)  execute the terms and conditions stipulated in the Surety Agreement; (d) require the Academic Panel to strictly screen the applicants or nominees for the APDP or FDP to avoid the same circumstances and  to protect the interest of the university; and; and (e) require the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs to file properly and completely all supporting documents in relation to the Grantees’ Fellowship Awards  including the Office who facilitated and administered the implementation of Faculty Development Program (FDP) /Academic Personnel Development Program (APDP) for monitoring purposes.









A)	SUMMARY OF TOTAL SUSPENSIONS, DISALLOWANCES AND CHARGES

		

		The University has unsettled suspension of P1,087,385.34, unsettled charges of P8,886.00 and unsettled disallowances of P3,542,286.33 as of December 31, 2020.

Modified–Qualified Opinion



We have audited the accompanying financial statements of MSU-Iligan Institute of Technology, Iligan City, which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as at December 31, 2020, and the Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Cash Flows, Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity and Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts for the year then ended and Notes to Financial Statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.



In our opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the Bases for Modified-Qualified Opinion section of our report, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the MSU-Iligan Institute of Technology as at December 31, 2020 and its financial performance, its cash flows and its comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs).



Bases for Modified –Qualified Opinion



As discussed in Part II and Part III of this report:



The accuracy and validity of the balance of the Cash in Bank account for seven (7) bank accounts as of October 12, 2020, could not be relied upon due to the existence of bulk  unreconciled items between the Bank Statements and the Check and Advice to Debit Disbursements Records (CkADADRecs), between the Bank Statements and the Subsidiary Ledgers, and the CkADADRecs and the Subsidiary Ledgers amounting to ₱175,674,093.85, ₱151,261,120.06, and ₱212,161,954.39, respectively, arising from the non-preparation of the monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS), as required under Section 74 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume 1; and Receivable Accounts totaling P49,057,475.20 is unreliable and doubtful due to a) unavailable  supporting records/documents to explain their existence/establishment, b)  balances that remained non- moving for five consecutive years or more, c) unreconciled inter-agency transactions, d) unadjusted balances in transferring of fund to another fund, and   d) provision of non- moving Impairment Loss-Accounts Receivables  for consecutive six years,   contrary  to Section 27 of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSASs), Section 15, Chapter 2  and Section 9, Chapter 3  of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs)  and Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) 1445, thus, impairing the accuracy and correctness of the balances of Receivable Accounts and the corresponding revenue accounts  in the Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020.



We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the agency in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our modified-qualified opinion.



Key Audit Matters



Except for the matter described in the Bases for Modified-Qualified Opinion section, we have determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report.



Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements



Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.



Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the University’s financial reporting process.



Auditor’s Responsibilities for Audit of the Financial Statements



Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

			The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and comply with the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) issued by the Commission on Audit per COA Resolution No. 2014-003 dated January 24, 2014.

			The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, unless stated otherwise. The Statement of Cash Flows is prepared using the direct method.

			

	Note 3: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

		

	1)				The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with the PPSAS.  

			

	2)					Financial Instruments



a)			Financial Assets



		Initial recognition and measurement	

		

		Financial assets within the scope of PPSAS 29 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are classified as financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. MSU-IIT determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

		

		Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace (regular way trades) are recognized on the trade date, i.e., the date that the MSU-IIT commits to purchase or sell the asset.

		

		MSU-IIT’s financial assets include: cash and short-term deposits; trade and other receivables; and loans and other receivables.

		

		Subsequent measurement

		

		The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their

		classification.

		

		Financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit

		

		Financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through surplus and deficit. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. 

		

		Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.  Financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in surplus or deficit.

		

		Loans and receivables

		

		Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less impairment. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Losses arising from impairment are recognized in the surplus or deficit.

		

		Held-to-maturity

		

		Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities are classified as held to maturity when the MSU-IIT has the positive intention and ability to hold it to maturity.  

		

		After initial measurement, held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less impairment.  Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in surplus or deficit.

		

		Derecognition

		

		MSU-IIT derecognizes a financial asset or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of similar financial assets when:



--	The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or is waived

--	The Institute has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party; and either: (a) the Institute has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset; or       (b) the Institute has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

		

		Financial assets carried at amortized cost

		

		The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in surplus or deficit. 

		

		If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not yet been incurred).

		

		Loans together with the associated allowance are written off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery and all collateral has been realized or transferred to the institute.

		

		Impairment of financial assets

		

The MSU-IIT assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred “loss event”) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. Evidence of impairment may include the following indicators:



--	The debtors or a group of debtors are experiencing significant financial difficulty;

--	Default or delinquency in interest or principal payments;

--	The probability that debtors will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization; and

--	Observable data indicates a measurable decrease in estimated future cash flows (e.g. changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults).

		

b)			Financial Liabilities

		

		Initial recognition and measurement

		

		Financial liabilities within the scope of PPSAS 29 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit or loans and borrowings, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. 

		

		All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings, plus directly attributable transaction costs.

		

		MSU-IIT’s financial liabilities include payables and due to officers and employees.

		

		Subsequent measurement 

		

		The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification.

		

		Financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through surplus or deficit.

		

Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term.



This category includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by PPSAS 29.



Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in surplus or deficit. 



Financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit



Financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through surplus or deficit.



Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term.



This category includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by PPSAS 29.



Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in surplus or deficit.



Loans and borrowing



After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognized in surplus or deficit when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the effective interest method amortization process.



Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.

		

		Derecognition

		

		A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.

		

		When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in surplus or deficit.



c)	   Offsetting of financial instruments

	

		Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated statement of financial position if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

		

		

	3)					Cash and Cash Equivalents

		

		Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash at bank, deposits on call and highly liquid investments, with an original maturity of three months or less, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.

		

	4)					Inventories

		

		Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition. To the extent that inventory was received through non-exchange transactions (for no cost or for a nominal cost), the cost of the inventory is its fair value at the date of acquisition.

		

		After initial recognition, inventory is measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. However, to the extent that a class of inventory is distributed or deployed at no charge or for a nominal charge, that class of inventory is measured at the lower of cost and current replacement cost.

		

		Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of operations, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale, exchange, or distribution.

		

		Inventories are recognized as an expense when deployed for utilization or consumption in the ordinary course of operations of the MSU-IIT.

		

	5)					Property, Plant and Equipment

		

		Recognition

		

		An item is recognized as property, plant, and equipment (PPE) if it meets the characteristics and recognition criteria as a PPE.

		

		The characteristics of PPE are as follows:

		• tangible items;

		• are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes; and

		• are expected to be used during more than one reporting period.

		

		An item of PPE is recognized as an asset if:  

		• It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to the entity; and

		• The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably.

		

		Measurement at Recognition

		

		An item recognized as PPE is measured at cost.

		

		A PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction is measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition.

		

		The cost of the PPE is the cash price equivalent or, for PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction its cost is its fair value as at recognition date.

		

Cost includes the following:



--		its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates;

--		expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items; and

--		initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired, or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that period.

		

		Measurement after Recognition

		

		After recognition, all PPE are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 

		

		When significant parts of PPE are required to be replaced at intervals, the MSU-IIT recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major repair/replacement is done, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. 

		

		All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense in surplus or deficit as incurred. 

		

		Depreciation

		

		Each part of an item of PPE with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately.

		

		The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expense unless it is included in the cost of another asset.

		

		Initial Recognition of Depreciation

		

		Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.  

		

		For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation is for one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month.  

		

		However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, depreciation is for the succeeding month.

		

		Depreciation Method

		

		The straight line method of depreciation shall be adopted unless another method is more appropriate for agency operation.

		

		Estimated Useful Life

		

		The MSU-IIT uses the Schedule on the Estimated Useful Life of PPE by classification prepared by COA.

		

		It uses a residual value equivalent to at least five percent (5%) of the cost of the PPE.

		

		Impairment 

		

		An asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount, or recoverable service amount, if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable service amount.

		

		Derecognition

		

		The MSU-IIT derecognizes items of property, plant and equipment and/or any significant part of an asset upon disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected from its continuing use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the surplus or deficit when the asset is derecognized.

		

	6)					Intangible Assets

		

		Recognition and Measurement

		

		Intangible assets are recognized when the items are identifiable non-monetary assets without physical substance; it is probable that the expected future economic benefits or service potential that are attributable to the assets will flow to the entity; and the cost or fair value of the assets can be measured reliably.

		

	7)					Changes in Accounting Policies and Estimates

		

		The MSU-IIT recognizes the effects of changes in accounting policy retrospectively. The effects of changes in accounting policy are applied prospectively if retrospective application is impractical.

		

		It recognizes the effects of changes in accounting estimates prospectively by including in surplus or deficit.

		

		The MSU-IIT corrects material prior period errors retrospectively in the first set of financial statements authorized for issue after their discovery by:

		

		•	Restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in which the error occurred; or

		•	If the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating the opening balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for the earliest prior period presented.

		

		Foreign currency transactions

		

		Transactions in foreign currencies were initially recognized by applying the spot exchange rate between the function currency and the foreign currency at the transaction. 

		

		At each reporting date:

		

		•	Foreign currency monetary items were translated using the closing rate;

		•	Nonmonetary items that were measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency were translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction; and

		•	Nonmonetary items that were measured at fair value in a foreign currency were translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.

		•	Exchange differences arising: (a) on the settlement of monetary items, or      (b) on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous financial statements, were recognized in surplus or deficit in the period in which they arise, except as those arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign operation.

		

	8)					Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions

		

Recognition and Measurement of Assets from Non-Exchange Transactions



An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction, other than services in-kind, that meets the definition of an asset are recognized as an asset if the following criteria are met:



--		It is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential associated with the asset will flow to the entity; and

--		The fair value of the asset can be measured reliably.



An asset acquired through a non-exchange transaction is initially measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition.



Recognition Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions



An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction recognized as an asset is recognized as revenue, except to the extent that a liability is also recognized in respect of the same inflow.



As MSU-IIT satisfies a present obligation recognized as a liability in respect of an inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction recognized as an asset, it reduces the carrying amount of the liability recognized and recognize an amount of revenue equal to that reduction.



Measurement of Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions



Revenue from non-exchange transactions is measured at the amount of the increase in net assets recognized by the entity, unless a corresponding liability is recognized.



Measurement of Liabilities on Initial Recognition from Non-Exchange Transactions



The amount recognized as a liability in a non-exchange transaction is the best estimate of the amount required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date.



Taxes



Taxes and the related fines and penalties were recognized when collected or when these were measurable and legally collectible. The related refunds, including those that were measurable and legally collectible, were deducted from the recognized tax revenue.



Fees and fines not related to taxes



The MSU-IIT recognizes revenues from fees and fines, except those related to taxes, when earned and the asset recognition criteria are met. Deferred income is recognized instead of revenue if there is a related condition attached that would give rise to a liability to repay the amount. 



Other non-exchange revenues are recognized when it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential associated with the asset will flow to the entity and the fair value of the asset can be measured reliably.

		

		Gifts and Donations

		

		The MSU-IIT recognizes assets and revenue from gifts and donations when it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential will flow to the entity and the fair value of the assets can be measured reliably.

		

		Goods in-kind are recognized as assets when the goods are received, or there is a binding arrangement to receive the goods. If goods in-kind are received without conditions attached, revenue is recognized immediately. If conditions are attached, a liability is recognized, which is reduced and revenue recognized as the conditions are satisfied.

		

		On initial recognition, gifts and donations including goods in-kind are measured at their fair value as at the date of acquisition, which were ascertained by reference to an active market, or by appraisal. An appraisal of the value of an asset is normally undertaken by a member of the valuation profession who holds a recognized and relevant professional qualification. For many assets, the fair value is ascertained by reference to quoted prices in an active and liquid market.

		

Transfers



The MSU-IIT recognizes an asset in respect of transfers when the transferred resources meet the definition of an asset and satisfy the criteria for recognition as an asset, except those arising from services in-kind.



Services in-Kind



Services in-kind are not recognized as asset and revenue considering the complexity of the determination of and recognition of asset and revenue and the eventual recognition of expenses.



Transfers from other government entities



Revenues from non-exchange transactions with other government entities and the related assets are measured at fair value and recognized on obtaining control of the asset (cash, goods, services and property) if the transfer is free from conditions and it is probable that the economic benefits or service potential related to the asset will flow to the MSU-IIT and can be measured reliably.

	9)					Revenue from Exchange Transactions

		

		Measurement of Revenue

		

		Revenue shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.

		

Rendering of Services



The MSU-IIT recognizes revenue from rendering of services by reference to the stage of completion when the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably. The stage of completion is measured by reference to labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated labor hours. 



Where the contract outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognized only to the extent that the expenses incurred are recoverable. 



Sale of Goods



Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods and when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits or service potential associated with the transaction will flow to the MSU-IIT.



Interest income



Interest income is accrued using the effective yield method. The effective yield discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. The method applies this yield to the principal outstanding to determine interest income each period.

		

		Rental income

		

		Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and included in revenue. 

		

	10)					Budget Information

		

		The annual budget is prepared on a cash basis and is published in the government website. 

		

		As a result of the adoption of the cash basis for budgeting purposes, a separate Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts is presented showing the basis, timing or entity differences. Explanatory comments are provided in the notes to the annual financial statements; first, the reasons for overall growth or decline in the budget are stated, followed by details of overspending or under-spending on line items.

		

		The annual budget figures included in the financial statements are for the MSU-IIT. These budget figures are those approved by the governing body both at the beginning and during the year following a period of consultation with the public.

		

	11)					Employee Benefits

		

		The employees of the MSU-IIT are members of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), which provides life and retirement insurance coverage. 

		

		The MSU-IIT recognizes expenses for accumulating compensated absences when these are paid (commuted or paid as terminal leave benefits). Unused entitlements that have accumulated at the reporting date are not recognized as expense. Non-accumulating compensated absences, like special leave privileges, are not recognized.

		

		Measurement uncertainty

		

		The preparation of financial statements in conformity with PPSASs, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the period.

		

		Estimates were based on the best information available at the time of preparation of the financial statements and were reviewed annually to reflect new information as it becomes available. Measurement uncertainty exists in these financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

		

Note 4: Changes in Accounting Policies

		

		The MSU-IIT adopted the Revised Chart of Accounts for National Government Agencies to conform with the PPSAS pursuant to COA Circular No. 2014-003 dated April 15, 2014 re: Conversion from the Philippine Government Chart of Accounts under the New Government Accounting System per COA Circular No. 2004-008 dated September 20, 2014 as amended, to the Revised Chart of Accounts for National Government Agencies. This accounting change had no significant impact on the University’s financial statements.

		

		A foreign currency transaction is a transaction that is denominated or requires settlement in a foreign currency. It shall be recorded, on initial recognition in the functional currency, by applying to the foreign currency amount the spot exchange rate between the functional currency and foreign currency at the date of the transaction.

AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



Financial and Compliance Audit



		1)	Due to weak internal control, various unrecorded deposits and interest income totaling P12,534,506.85 and P15,540,915.49 in the Check and ADA Disbursements Records and the Subsidiary Ledgers, respectively, as well as unconsidered numerous disbursements and tax remittances totaling to P101,925.47 and P798,662.54, in their respective books, affected the accuracy and reliability of the Cash-In Bank (CIB) account and resulted in the deviation from the procedures of recording financial items laid down in the Government Accounting Manual.

		

The Government Accounting Manual covers the financial reporting by national government agencies which include state universities.	

		

		Sec. 3, Chapter 2, states that fiscal responsibility shall, to the greatest extent, be shared by all those exercising authority over the financial affairs, transactions, and operations of the government agency. The head of any agency of the government is immediately and primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency. Persons entrusted with the possession or custody of the funds or property under the agency head shall be immediately responsible to him, without prejudice to the liability of either party to the government. Further, every officer of any government agency whose duties permit or require the possession or custody of government funds or property shall be accountable therefor and for the safekeeping thereof in conformity with law. Every accountable officer (AO) shall be properly bonded in accordance with law.

		

		No AO shall be relieved from liability by reason of his having acted under the direction of a superior officer in paying out, applying, or disposing of the funds or property with which he is chargeable, unless prior to that act, he notified the superior officer in writing of the illegality of the payment, application, or disposition. The officer directing any illegal payment or disposition of the funds or property shall be primarily liable for the loss, while the AO who fails to serve the required notice shall be secondarily liable.

		

		Because of the heavy responsibilities put upon accountable officers, the GAM has included in its content financial templates and the corresponding instructions on how to fill in the templates with the needed data. Also, procedures and journal entries from time of receipt of the asset to the time of disposal are clearly written in its pages.

		

		In reporting revenue and other receipts, for example, Chapter 5 of the same Manual has enumerated different revenue received by agencies. Sec. 39 prescribes the procedures and financial templates to be used in every procedure. The Section states that receipts and deposits shall be reported as follows:

		

a)			At the close of the business day, the Collecting Officers shall prepare the Report of Collections and Deposits (RCD) for submission to Accounting Office/Unit. The report lists all the ORs issued in numerical sequence including cancelled ones.

b)			The RCD shall be supported by documentary evidence such as duplicate copies of ORs and validated deposit slips.

c)			The Collecting government entity issuing electronic Official Receipt (eOR) should generate and submit daily to the Auditor a copy of the RCD. In case the collection system is not integrated with the accounting system, the Accounting Division/Unit shall recognize the collections and deposits based on the generated reports duly certified by the Collecting Officer/Cashier/Head of Cash/Treasury Unit.

Checks shall be drawn only on duly approved disbursement voucher (DV) or Payroll. These shall be used for payment of regular expenses which cannot be conveniently nor practically paid using the ADA or not authorized to be paid using the Petty Cash Fund or advances for operating expenses. Sec. 12 of the Chapter laid down the procedures for disbursements by checks and the recording thereof in the Cashier Unit and the Accounting Unit:

		The procedures prescribed in the GAM was not utilized by MSU-IIT in the recording of its collections and disbursements as numerous issues arise during the verification and reconciliation of its books and reports, on the other hand, and the bank statements, on another.

		

		In the conduct of reconciliation between the bank statements and the books of the Agency, the Special Audit Team was able to reconcile eighteen (18) bank accounts, out of the 21 bank accounts, with their books for CY 2019, while only fourteen (14) bank accounts for CY 2020 due to the unavailability of bank statements, or even the bank account snapshots in contrary to the agreement that existed during the special conference conducted between the Special Audit Team, together with the Residents Auditors, and the Management.

		

		During this period, voluminous reconciling items were revealed for both the records of the Cashier Unit and the Accounting Unit. There are even items that were not taken up in the agency’s bank reconciliation statements.

		

		The following Schedules enumerates the unrecorded deposits and income, as well as the unconsidered disbursements, in the books and their existence since the CY 2018 Cash Examination, or even earlier:

		The agency did not give any consideration that these reconciling items exist due to its failure to periodically reconcile the records of its depositories and its own records, carrying forward the errors or reconciling items from year to year, making the CIB account unreliable every year of reporting.

		

		Failure of the agency to follow the process laid down by the GAM religiously, or as discussed above, may result to unrecorded or unconsidered items in the records of the agency. Further, because the Agency’s bank statements are not monitored and reconciled, there are items that have added to the already existing unreconciled items, thus, the potential for undetected loss is high, hence, government funds may be embezzled and lost in the hands of accountable officers without being detected.

		

		Also, when the Agency has no existing internal control better than that laid in the GAM and it has failed to follow the procedures in the Manual, weak internal control of cash may result and funds of the government may be used for what it is not intended.

		

		We recommended that Management require the Accountant to draw a JEV to make the necessary correction cited above and instruct its accountable officers and the Accounting personnel to follow the steps discussed in this memorandum to ensure that recording of cash and other liquid assets are properly made. Further, we recommended that internal control be assessed so that lapses and loopholes be detected and corrected. 

	



Management Comment:



During the Exit Conference, the Vice Chancellor for Administration and Finance took notice of the observation and committed to try their bests to address the issues and implement the recommendations.





2)	The accuracy and validity of the balance of the Cash in Bank account for seven (7) bank accounts as of October 12, 2020, could not be relied upon due to the existence of bulk unreconciled items between the Bank Statements and the Check and Advice to Debit Disbursements Records (CkADADRecs), between the Bank Statements and the Subsidiary Ledgers, and the CkADADRecs and the Subsidiary Ledgers amounting to ₱175,674,093.85, ₱151,261,120.06, and ₱212,161,954.39, respectively, arising from the non-preparation of the monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS), as required under Section 74 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume 1.



		Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) provides that the monthly BRS shall be prepared by the Chief Accountant/designated staff within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the Government Servicing Bank. In turn, the Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty days after the receipt of the monthly BS to the Head of the Agency and the COA Auditor, with all the supporting documents and journal entry vouchers.

		

		A bank reconciliation, in layman’s term, is the process of matching information regarding cash accounts from accounting records to the corresponding information on bank statements. It needs to be done regularly to identify discrepancies before they become problems. It is a very important tool for internal control of cash flows. In view of that fact, the Government Accounting Manual has set up a whole chapter for its discussion.		

		Though the finance officer has the duty to supervise the accounting department/unit and ensure that all financial reports are accomplished completely on time, it is the head of the agency, chancellor in this case, who is required by the Section 74 of P.D. No. 1445 to see to it that reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the monthly reports of depositories (bank statements) and the balance found in the books of the agency. Chancellors not only be interested in the educational operation of their respective universities, but should also be, most importantly, interested in the financial well-being of their agencies.

		

		Despite the number of memorandums transmitted to the Agency of similar findings, it has failed to prepare the monthly BRS, notwithstanding that bulk discrepancies between the records of the government banks and the agency’s books were involved.

		

		As of this date, the Special Audit Team managed to reconcile the bank statements and the books of the agency for eighteen (18) bank accounts dated December 26, 2019 and fourteen (14) bank accounts dated October 12, 2020, that, unfortunately, resulted to a numerous reconciling items which we have issued a separate audit observation memorandum.

		

		The seven (7) bank accounts with unreconciled balances showed the existence of a discrepancy between the bank records and the cashier’s books amounting to ₱175,674,093.85, and a discrepancy of ₱151,261,120.06 between the bank records and the accounting records. Also there was a discrepancy of ₱212,161,954.39 between the cashier’s records and the accounting books.  These amounts are better shown in the following table:

		The huge amount of discrepancies between records and the non-existence of the BRS at the end of every month should signal the head of the agency of the irregularities in function of its finance unit. The non-receipt of bank statements from the depositories should not shrug off the importance of monthly reconciliation of cash records, given that cash is the most liquid asset that can be easily manipulated by its holders.

		

		The Head of the Accounting Unit commented that because of the subsisting work arrangements due to pandemic that only few were reporting to the office while others are exercising their work from home arrangement, the manpower of the Unit is not enough to cope up with its deadlines.

		

		We commented that the Civil Service Commission’s mandate of alternative work arrangement that part of the work week is to be made at home should not be meant to be holidays or no-work days, this should be mean that work must be done even from home, and that the new work arrangement should not hamper the preparation of the Agency’s reports and their submission on time, as mandated by existing rules and regulations.

		

		The main objective of bank and book reconciliation is to check the correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s records, serve as a deterrent to fraud, and enable the agency bank to take up charges and credits recognized by the bank or agency but not yet known to the bank.

		

		With the delay in the preparation of the BRS, delay of submission thereof to COA follows, and, as consequences, the timely correction may not be made and lapses in the bank transactions may not be noticed. In other words, the objectives of the preparation are defeated. Thus, purpose of preparation is defeated and balances are not accurate.

		

		We recommended that Management demand from its personnel who is/are in charge of the preparation of BRS to prepare and submit the bank reconciliation statements until the month of October 2020, and until then, to withhold the salaries of these personnel. Furthermore, instruct them to abide by the provisions mandating the timely submission of BRS.



Management Comment:



The Chief Accountant explained that the delay in the preparation of BRS is attributable to the fact that the voluminous transactions being processed and the duties assigned to the accounting office cannot be effectively executed by its existing manpower complement. 



He further added that on the recommendation of withholding the salaries of the personnel in charge of the preparation of BRS, the personnel shall be given a chance to be heard before implementing such deprivation of salaries. Also, there has to be substantial amount of evidence to warrant such recommendation. In this case, the Accountant would like to validate the personnel in charge’s PDF to verify whether or not such personnel have the primary duties and responsibilities on the said BRS. 



The Audit team commented that delay in the preparation of BRS has been the perineal problem of the agency which is the main cause of having numerous unreconciled items. The team insisted that withholding of salaries from the personnel who are in-charged of preparation of BRS should be enforced as prescribed in the aforementioned government rules and regulations. This might resolve of lessen the issue on unreconciled items.





3)	The accuracy and existence of the balance of the cash in bank account as of September 30, 2020 could not be ascertained due to the non-preparation/non-submission of the monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) as required under Section 74 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume 1.



Section 74 of PD No. 1445 requires the head of agency to see to it that reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the monthly reports of depositories (bank statements) and the balance found in the books of the agency.



The Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Chapter 21, in describing the method of preparation of the BRS, states that the monthly BRS shall be prepared by the Chief Accountant/designated staff within ten days from receipt of the monthly bank statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/ Credit Memoranda (CM) from the Government Servicing bank. In turn, the Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty days after the receipt of the monthly BS to the following:



	Original	-	COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents and JEVs)

	Copy 2		-	Head of Agency

	Copy 3	 	-	Accounting Division/Unit File

	Copy 4		-	Bank, if necessary



Despite of the above provisions, the Agency failed to timely prepare the monthly BRS of its twenty-two (22) bank accounts. As of October 15, 2020, the latest BRS received by the Office of the Auditor were as follows:

Analyzing the table above, we see that:



--	The latest bank and book reconciliation made by the agency is for the period ending January 31, 2019;

--	Out of the 22 bank accounts, only four (4) accounts were reconciled with the books for the period ending January 31, 2020;

--	Two (2) of the active and unclosed bank accounts were reconciled only as of March 30, 2019 that the Accountant never bothered to update the corresponding BRS for periods closer to this date; and

--	The Accountant has not taken seriously his task of reconciling bank accounts and books.



The Agency argued in its reply to the previous memorandum dated October 25, 2019 that it has been compliant to the rules of the Government Accounting Manual that it did prepare and submitted its BRS to the Auditor’s Office within twenty days from the receipt of the bank statements.



However, the Accountant, in a conversation with the Special Audit Team last October 14, 2020, contended that the Agency has already received bank statements for the month of July 2020 but due to lack of manpower caused by the recent pandemic that work week in the office is not 5-day arrangement, the Agency failed in the timely preparation of its BRS.



The main objective of bank and book reconciliation is to check the correctness of both bank’s and agency’s records, serve as a deterrent to fraud, and enable the agency bank to take up charges and credits recognized by the bank or agency but not yet known to the bank.



With the delay in the preparation of the BRS, delay of submission thereof to COA follows, and, as consequences, the timely correction may not be made and lapses in the bank transactions may not be notices. In other words, the objectives of the preparation are defeated.



The Civil Service Commission’s mandate of alternative work arrangement that part of the work week is to be made at home should not be a hindrance to the preparation of the Agency’s reports, as a general and submission of them on time, as mandated by existing rules and regulations.



We recommended that Management review the existing bank accounts and those which are non-moving and demand from their personnel the immediate preparation of BRS and submit them to the Office of the Auditor within 30 days from receipt of this report. 



Management Comment:



Management commented that MSU-IIT Chief Accountant instructed Ms. Sheila Mae Malagum, assigned at the Remittance Section, to prioritize the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) indicated in the said AOM. Accounting office has been doing the BRS until this date.



Nevertheless the Chief Accountant would like to manifest the following events that transpired during this year 2020:



	1. The Chief Accountant is newly appointed and just assumed his office last February 2020;



	2. Upon assumption one of his priorities is to respond to the 2019 Audit observation Memoranda;



	3. However, the latter had been deferred because on March 20, 2020, in light f the public health emergency of international concern involving covi-19, the institute through Memo Circular 2020-003, declared suspension of work and classes, and maintained skeleton workforce;



	4. The Accounting Office’s personnel as part of the skeleton workforce have been consistent in delivering services despite the imminent danger and immeasurable fears suffered by the employees;



	5. The Accounting office has to adopt new rules and regulations issued by government agencies, such as DBM, CSC, and Institute IATF guidelines and have to accept the new norms.



	6. As to the availability of the Bank Statements, they have been available last October 2020 for the period March to June 2020;



	7. As to the manpower set-up of the Accounting Office, the Chief Accountant observed that such office has been constrained with three (3) personnel. Thus, the Accounting Office has accumulated backlogs;

	8. Alternative Work Arrangements (Work from Home) has not been that effective and efficient at the Accounting Office because of the availability of computers, internet/intranet systems; and



	9. Finally, the Institute will adopt 75% and 100% physical manpower starting November and December 2020, respectively.



	In addition hereto, during the exit conference, the Vice Chancellor for Administration and Finance has committed to monitor the compliance of the Accounting Division with the timely submission of BRS.





Receivables Accounts



4)	Receivable Accounts totaling P71,591,113.64 is unreliable and doubtful due to a) unavailable  supporting records/documents to explain their existence/establishment, b)  balances that remained non-moving for five consecutive years or more, c) unreconciled inter-agency transactions, d) unadjusted balances in transferring of fund to another fund, and   e) provision of non- moving Impairment Loss-Accounts Receivables  for consecutive six years,   contrary  to Section 27 of the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSASs), Section 15, Chapter 2  and Section 9, Chapter 3  of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs)  and Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) 1445, thus, impairing the accuracy and correctness of the balances of Receivable Accounts and the corresponding revenue accounts  in the Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020.

	

Section 27 of the PPSAS 1 and Section 15, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs Volume 1 state that “the Financial Statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity.” Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSASs.”



Sec. 9, Chapter 3 of GAM Volume I also provides that Impairment Losses and Allowance for Impairment Losses. When an uncertainty arises about the collectibility of an amount already included in revenue, the uncollectible amount, or the amount in respect of which recovery has ceased to be probable, is recognized as an expense (impairment losses), rather than as an adjustment of the amount of revenue originally recognized.

Entities shall evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable on an ongoing basis based on historical bad debts, customer/recipient credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in payment activity. An allowance is provided for known and estimated bad debts.



Further, Sections 111 and 112 of PD No.  1445 require agencies to keep the accounts in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government; and that the highest standard of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. Each government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations conformably with PPSASs and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations.

	As stated in the Notes to Financial Statements, the Due from Government-Owned and/or Controlled Corporations in the amount of P1,128,940.99 under Fund 01 represents the over remittance to GSIS as a result of reconciliation. This has been reflected in the Trial Balance of the institute since Dec. 31, 2014. Ironically, per our confirmation letter with the GSIS as attached herewith as Appendix B, it turned out that as of October 31, 2020, MSU - Iligan Institute of Technology due premiums inclusive of interests from July 1997 to aforementioned date are amounting to Ninety-Five Million Seven Hundred Eighty-Eight Thousand Twenty-Seven and 76/100 (Php 95,788,027.76), herewith attached as Appendix C is a Letter of GSIS to the institute of which a copy was furnished to us. 



As a matter of fact, in CY 2019, we had a Memorandum issued to the institute pertaining to the Under Remittance of the Premiums and Loan Repayments due to Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) which was incorporated in the Annual Audit Report (AAR) as of December 31, 2019.



On Dec. 4, 2017, an amount of P78,000.00 was transferred from Fund 05 to Fund07 with DV No. 10887717122965. The entry to close the Other Receivables – Due from Other Funds account was not made upon transfer and until to date.



Moreover, provision of Impairment Loss of P12,751.40 has not been changed since CY 2014.



With the foregoing observations, the Receivable Accounts in the amount of P71,591,113.64 are doubtful and unreliable, thus, impairing the fair presentation of Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020.



 	We recommended that management institute the following courses of actions:



a)	Exert efforts to retrieve the documents in support to the existence of the receivable accounts, otherwise, evaluate the dormant accounts and comply with all the conditions and requirements of COA Circular 2016 – 005 dated December 19, 2016 for the request for write-off;



b)	Reconcile properly with the GSIS for the alleged under remittance of the premiums due as of October 30, 2020 in the amount of  Php  95,788,027.76 and if warranted, remit immediately the amount due to refrain from further accrual of interest to avoid  adverse effect on the concerned  employees, as well as to prevent the filing of administrative, criminal and collection cases against the institute;



c)	Effect the adjusting entry to close the transfer of account from Fund 05 to Fund 07 in the amount of P78,000.00; and 



d)	Properly evaluate the recognized Impairment Loss amounting to P12,751.40 which remained non-moving since December 2014 in order present fairly the Financial Statements of the agency.



Management Comment:



The Management commented the following:



a)	The Accounting Division will request a r write-off after thorough evaluation of the transactions included in the Accounts Receivable which are dormant and beyond collectibility;

b)	The Management is now in the process of reconciliation with the GSIS;

c)	The Accounting Division will record the adjusting entry to close the transfer of account from Fund 05 to Fund 07 in the amount of P78,000.00;

d)	The Accounting Division will review the Impairment Loss and co-relate it with the identified dormant accounts. If there is a need to increase the impairment loss as a result thereof, then, the Impairment Loss will be updated.





5)	Student Assistance Fund for Education (SAFE) for Loan to students granted by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) last April 2010 has an unutilized balance of P1,443,000.00 representing 72.15% of the P2,000,000.00 given, thus, defeating the purpose of the program and the would be benefits that the students could have derived from that program.



The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) provided a financial assistance of P2,000,000.00 in CY 2010 for graduating students of MSU-IIT to help defray educational expenses of the students through its Student Assistance Fund for Education (SAFE) for Loan Program.



For the graduating students to avail of the said loan, MSU-Iligan Institute of Technology (MSU-IIT) through its Department of Student Affairs (DSA) and the graduating student referred to as Principal Debtor and a permanent employee of the institute referred to as CO-MAKER, entered into a Contract of Loan under the following terms and conditions, to wit:



1)	That the amount of Eight Thousand Pesos (P8,000.00) shall be granted to the student-borrower, without interest;

2)	That the amount shall be payable after two (2) years or Twenty Four (24) months after graduation from college or when the principal debtor/borrower is already gainfully employed, whichever comes first, without need of demand for payment from the DSA;

3)	That the Co-maker is jointly and severally bound with the principal debtor in the payment of this loan and thus, should the principal debtor/borrower fails to pay the amount granted on the date stipulated above, MSU-IIT shall deduct the amount due from the payroll of the Co-maker;

4)	In this case, the amount due shall be deducted from the payroll of the Co-maker without notice or demand from the principal debtor or from the Co-maker until the full amount shall have been fully paid;

5)	That the amount to be deducted from the payroll shall not be less than Five Hundred Pesos (P500.00) per month; and

6)	That the Co-maker shall likewise be liable for payment of the entire amount borrowed, even prior to the lapse of the Two-year period stated above, if the principal debtor has already been gainfully employed after graduation but fails to pay to MSU-IIT.



Apart from the Contract of Loan, another document was also executed which was the Commitment of the Co-Maker to Pay the CHED SAFE Loan, in case of default by the Principal Borrower where details, terms and conditions are stipulated therein.



Our review of the pertinent documents at the DSA Office who administered the implementation of the SAFE Loan Program disclosed that for the period from CY 2010- CY 2015, a number of students availed of   loans with their corresponding co-makers as attached herewith as Appendix D. It has an outstanding balance of loan in the total amount of P616,255.00 as of September 30, 2020 and unutilized balance of P1,443,000.00.



Our interview with the DSA personnel revealed that the last student who availed of the loan was last March 2015. Since then, no student had ever availed of the program because no regular employee of the institute was willing to be Co-maker or guarantor. Thus, the balance of P1,443,000.00 remained unutilized since 2015 to date. As a matter of fact, Dr. Edward L. Banawa, the then acting director of DSA Office, wrote a letter dated October 18, 2016  to Ms. Dela Rama,  the former  OIC of the Accounting Office, urging to return the amount of P1,443,00.00 to CHED Region X as the funding agency,which was not given due course.



Moreover, our verification of the books of accounts disclosed a balance of Loan Receivable – Others of P614,255.00 which represents the outstanding balance of loans granted to students and the unreleased balance of P1,443,000.00 which are reflected in the Financial Statements since December 31, 2015.



With the foregoing observations, the management apparently had not enforced the collection strategy as set under the Contract of Loan. They did not exert maximum and diligent efforts to collect from the student-borrowers or in case of default, from the respective co-makers, some of whom have already retired or due for retirement. Thus, the objectives of the Student Assistance Fund for Education (SAFE) for Loan Program were not attained.



We recommended that management should enforce immediately the terms and conditions set under the Contract of Loan which provides that if the principal debtor/borrower fails to pay the amount granted on the date stipulated therein, then the amount due shall be deducted from the payroll of the co-maker at Five Hundred Pesos (P500.00) per month until fully paid which deduction does not need any notice or demand to the principal debtor or to the Co-maker. Moreover, the DSA office should reconcile with the Accounting Office to come up with the correct outstanding balance of loans. 



We recommended further, that the balance of  P1,443,000.00 should be returned to the funding agency since the sustainability and efficiency of the program were not attained and assured.

	

Management Comment:



	Management returned the unexpended balance of P1,443,000 to the Commission on Higher Education and submitted the disbursement voucher of the said transaction. Moreover, they are now trying to collect the outstanding loan balances from the principal debtors or to the respective co-makers. As of February 15, 2021, the management has already collected the total amount of P290,200.00.

	

	

6)	Management is very lax in enforcing agreement to render return service by a number of faculty members granted with Fellowship Awards with the unpaid expenditures of  P10,415,519.26 as of November 30, 2020 for their Study Grants which is not consistent with the Guidelines for Faculty Development Program (FDP) /Academic Personnel Development Program (APDP) and in violation of the Fellowship Agreement Contract executed and entered into by the institute and the grantee,  thus, defeating the  purpose and objectives of the program and the maximum benefits that could have been  derived therefrom were not realized.



By Virtue of Resolution No. 264 series of 2010 of the Board of Regents of the Mindanao State University, the MSU- Iligan Institute of Technology is authorized to grant Fellowship awards as a privilege to faculty members of the Institute who shall be sent for advanced studies or training to leading Universities/Institutions in the Philippines and/or abroad.  



The criteria for Fellowship Grants, among others, are to those who are deserving, ready and willing to assume a share in the expense for their self-improvement, and they are awarded in the interest of the Institute and for the purpose of enhancing the usefulness of the teaching staff.



After going through several procedures, the Applicants or Nominees were interviewed, screened and supervised by the Academic Panel created by the Institute. Once a faculty member has met the requirements, accepted and availed the grant, a Contract of Fellowship Agreement was executed by and between the faculty member, referred to as Grantee and the Institute, referred to as Grantor.



The responsibilities of the Institute as Grantor in the Fellowship Agreement are the following:

1)	The Grantor shall issue a Special Order awarding to the Grantee the study grant;

2)	The Grantor authorized the Grantee to avail of the study leave on full time basis; and 

3)	Provide the Grantee with the following privileges;

a)	Salary and other remuneration due him;

b)	Monthly stipend;

c)	Tuition and other fees (per bill sent to the Institute);

d)	Book Allowance;

e)	Thesis Allowance;

f)	Roundtrip air fare (return fare to be reimbursed at the end of the Academic Year and upon presentation of used tickets; Apart from the Contract of Loan, another document was also executed which was the Commitment of the Co-Maker to Pay the CHED SAFE Loan, in case of default by the Principal Borrower where details, terms and conditions are stipulated therein.



The responsibilities of the Faculty Member as Grantee are the following:



1)	The Grantee shall, among others, pursue a program leading to __(course)____________________ at the __________________. He shall change his field of specialization nor venue his studies other than what is specified in the course he is pursuing and as stated in the Agreement. In case the grantee shall shift to another program or transfer to another university he must seek first the approval of the Grantor stating the reasons for the Transfer; Upon termination of the grant, the grantee shall serve at his official station for a period as stated in the return service provision of the scholarship grant;



2)	Should the GRANTEE fail to finish or complete the degree due to resignation, voluntary retirement or fails to render return service, or for other causes within the control of the GRANTEE, the GRANTEE shall be liable to pay the Institute, within thirty (30) days from deferment of the study grant or fail to render return service, the amount equal to the total expenses incurred for his/her scholarship. It shall include all expenses incurred for his/her study and emoluments and salaries received, with 12% interest per annum computed from date of deferment or failure to render or complete return service. Should the return service not be completed due to the causes previously cited, the monetary equivalent shall be deducted from the total obligation to be paid. In case of failure to settle the account after the billing, a two (2%) percent per annum penalty shall be imposed. In no case shall the payment of refund be on installment basis.



The Guidelines for FDP provided also the Return Service requirements of Grantees which shall be based on the following;

:

1)	Local

	1)	For study grants of one year or more, a return service of 2 years for every year of study grant or a major fraction thereof shall be required.

	2)	For study grants, travel grants for observation and attendance in seminars, special training grants, and other grants involving 6 months but not less than 1 month, a return service of one year shall be required.

2)	Foreign

	1)	For study grants of 1 year or more, a return service of 3 years for every

year of study leave or a major fraction thereof shall be required.

	2)	For study grants, travel grants for observation and attendance in seminars, special training grants, and other grants involving 6 months but not less than 1 month, a return service of one and a half years shall be required.

	3)	For grants involving less than 1 month, no return service shall be required.

3)	The return service proviso applies without distinction to both study grants on official time only and those with privileges.

4)	When a grantee does not render the required return service stipulated in the fellowship contract following the expiration of the grant,

	1)	The Chancellor shall write to the institution where the grantee is presently connected about his/her return service obligation and lack of clearance from the University;

	2)	The grantee’s case shall be submitted to the University Legal Division administration for administrative and legal charges.



In addition to Fellowship Agreement, a SURETYSHIP AGREEMENT was also executed wherein made and entered into by and between a Surety and the Grantee, referred to as Principal. As stated under this Suretyship Agreement, among others, is “The liability of the SURETY under this Agreement shall be solidary, direct and immediate and not contingent upon the pursuit by MSU-IIT of whatever remedies it may have against the PRINCIPAL, and the SURETY shall, at anytime on demand, pay to MSU-IIT whatever amount is owing from the PRINCIPAL to MSU-IIT to the extent as stated in the Agreement.



Moreover, the considerations for Renewal, Extension or Recall of a grantee were also provided in the Guidelines.



We noted in our review and evaluation of the implementation of Academic Personnel Development Program (APDP) or Faculty Development Program (FDP) that a number of faculty members availed of the program but they did not return to render service to the institute upon completion of their studies. Two were not able to finish their degree and yet they did not return to the institute. We noted further that supporting documents of other grantees were neither available nor complete in the Office of Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs who facilitated and administered the program.   Attached herewith Appendix E showing the List of Reneged Fellows with the Summary and Details of their Study Grants based on the available pertinent documents submitted to our office.



It can be gleaned from the Annex that the Fellowship was granted to the faculty members in the Academic Year period from 1992 to 2008, more than ten years ago already, but the Institute’s Legal Administration has not undertaken any administrative and legal charges against them except for Mr. Eduardo Senajon. They only issued Demand Letters for the return service obligation of the grantees. It was noted also that two of these reneging fellows made payment for their obligation on installment basis which is contrary to the terms and conditions set forth under Fellowship Agreement Contract.



It is clear and understandable that once the grantee signed the Fellowship Contract, he/she took the responsibility and obligations, binding him/her to fulfil the stipulated terms and conditions therein and to take also whatever consequences that may arise therefrom.



Meanwhile, the Other Receivables account as of November 30, 2020 reflected an outstanding balance of P10,405,160.42 representing the amount to be reimbursed to the institute by the nine (9) Reneging Fellows who failed to render Return Service upon termination of their grants, breakdown of which is as follows:

								    Balance as of 

NAME 								November 30, 2020

1)	Abal, Eva G.							        P    635,793.40

2)	Arig, Melicent J.							1,069,146.41

3)	Delid, Ma. Merdeka							   605,836.00

4)	Senajon, Eduardo T.						 	1,466,081.37

5)	Dimalen Davis 							1,572,052.06

6)	Dimalen, Editha D. 							   374,785.36

7)	Giganto, Reynaldo							2,164,179.53

9)	Paler, Mary Elvie A.							2,397,124.83

Other Receivables as of November 30, 2020 per Book (Net)   P   10,405,160.42



It is worthy to emphasize that one of the responsibilities of the grantees as set forth in the Fellowship Agreement Contract is upon termination of the grant, the grantee shall serve at his official station for a period as stated in the return service provision of the scholarship grant. However, when a grantee does not render the required return service stipulated in the fellowship contract following the expiration of the grant, the Chancellor shall write to the institution where the grantee is presently connected about his/her return service obligation and lack of clearance from the University, and the grantee’s case shall be submitted to the University Legal Division administration for administrative and legal charges.



With the foregoing observations, the institute is apparently lax on enforcing and taking legal action against the faculty members who enjoyed the Fellowship Study Grant but failed to render Return Service to the institute. Hence, the objectives and the maximum benefits that could have been realized were not achieved.



We recommended that management do the following:



a)	Enforce strictly the terms and conditions set forth under the Fellowship Agreement Contract and that payment of the two reneging fellows on installment basis should not have been allowed as it was a breach of the Contract. It also became a precedence whereby the grantees would not be forced or obliged to return service to the institute after the study grant;



b)	File administrative and legal charges against the aforementioned reneging fellows who were granted with the Study Grants in the Academic Year period since 1992 to present immediately,  if warranted;



c)	Execute the terms and conditions stipulated in the Surety Agreement;  



d)	Require the Academic Panel to strictly screen the applicants or nominees for the APDP or FDP to avoid the same circumstances and  to protect the interest of the university; and



e)	Require the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs to file properly and completely all supporting documents in relation to the Grantees’ Fellowship Awards  including the Office who facilitated and administered the implementation of Faculty Development Program (FDP) /Academic Personnel Development Program (APDP) for monitoring purposes.



Management Comment:



The Chancellor commented that they started to undertake legal action against these reneging faculty members.



Further, during the Exit Conference, the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs explained on the fifth recommendation that since only internally granted scholarships pass through the OVCAA and for the external scholarship grants, there are different point persons for each grant whereby they could not file properly and completely all supporting documents in relation to scholarship grants. But if OVCAA will be the repository for all scholarship grants documents through a memorandum from the Chancellor, then, they would be willing to have all the subject documents.





Compliance - Procurement Activities



7)	Non-submission of complete supporting documents for six (6) major projects with an aggregate cost of P 160,329,578.85 is violation to COA Circular No. 2009-01 dated February 12, 2009 and COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 thus, prevented the auditor to undertake auditorial and legal review necessary for generating timely and relevant audit results and also, cast doubts on the regularity of the payment of the transactions.



	COA Circular No. 2009-01 dated February 12, 2009 prescribes the submission of copy of government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents to the Commission on Audit irrespective of amount.

		

Item 3.1.1 of the said circular requires that “Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.” 

	

COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribed the Revised Guidelines and Documentary Requirements for Common Government Transactions.



These laws provide the documentary and information requirements of perfected contracts to facilitate the submission, review and evaluation process.  The copies of documents required to be submitted shall include those enumerated in Item 3.1.2 and such other documents peculiar to the contract and/or to the mode of procurement and considered necessary in the auditorial, legal and technical review as well as in the inspection of projects.

	

As for the penalty, Item 4.1 provides that “Any unjustified failure of the officials and employees concerned to comply with the requirements herein imposed shall be subject to the administrative disciplinary action provided in (a) Section 127 of Presidential Decree No. 1445; (b) Section 55, Title I-B, Book V of the Revised Administrative Code of 1987; and (c) Section 11 of Republic Act No. 6713.”

	

A letter dated October 16, 2019 was received from the management requesting our good office to conduct a review of seven (7) projects as attached herewith as Appendix F. Per our review of the project contracts and its supporting documents, except for one, we found out that there were lacking supporting documents which prevented us to facilitate the conduct of legal and auditorial review of the project contracts. Therefrom, we communicated this to the management through a letter dated December 11, 2019 enumerating therein the lacking supporting documents for each project as attached herewith as Appendix G. Since then, no reply has been received yet from the management.



Further, we post-audited the pertinent disbursement vouchers for each project and revealed that some documents required in the disbursement transactions were not attached thereto but still payments have been made. Attached is Appendix H showing the results of our post-audit of the pertinent vouchers which have apparently lacking documents as enumerated therein.



Aside from the lacking documents enumerated in the Appendix H, we noted also that the initial contract amounts for the six projects differed from the total payments made which means there were changes in the initial contract costs of the projects. Thus, additional documentary requirements as provided in Section 9.1.1.2 of COA Circular 2012-001 and a list of documents as enumerated in the Annex B of COA Memorandum No. 2005-027 dated Feb. 28, 2005 should have been submitted to our office for review/evaluation of the changes in the contract to determine its reasonableness.



Per our post-audit of the disbursement vouchers, the aforementioned additional documentary requirements or the list of documents were not attached to the payment transactions.



With the foregoing observations, the Audit Team was not able to undertake auditorial and legal review of the contract in the evaluation of compliance with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations, completeness of documentary requirements and an initial evaluation of the contractual covenants that should not be disadvantageous to the government. This would also delay the communication to management of any information or deficiencies noted in the review. 

			

Further, this also cast doubts as to reasonableness of project costs and contract prices and the legality and propriety of the contracts and its pertinent bidding documents.



We recommended that management:



a)	Submit immediately the lacking supporting documents as stated in our letter dated December 11, 2019 per Appendix G;



b)	Submit the documentary requirements as provided in COA Circular 2012-001 for the payment transactions for the six(6) projects and submit the documents as provided in Appendix G of  COA Memo No. 2005-006 dated Feb. 28, 2005  for the changes in the initial contract project costs; and



c)	Concerned personnel must revisit the pertinent rules and regulations such as COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, Item 9.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and COA Memorandum No. 2005-027 dated Feb. 28, 2005.



Management Comment:



During the Exit Conference, the Physical Plant Division Director explained that they are trying to locate some of the required documents at their office and at the Procurement Servicing Division. He added that they are trying their best in securing them for submission to COA. The Chancellor further added and assigned the OVCAF to secure the required documents within ten days.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Supervising Auditor gave the management ten (10) days from the date of the Exit Conference (February 16, 2021) to submit the required documents otherwise a Notice of Suspension shall be issued thereto.





Compliance with Tax Laws



MSU-IIT regularly remitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) taxes withheld from compensations and VAT from purchased of goods and service.  For the period ended December 31, 2020, taxes collected amounted to P106,202,337.49 and remitted to the BIR amounted to P105,885,951.85, the difference is due to tax refunds and adjustments.

Compliance with RA No. 8291 Re: Deduction of GSIS Premiums and Remittances



During CY 2019, a Memorandum was issued to the Institute pertaining to the under remittance of the Premiums and Loan Repayments due to Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) which was incorporated in the Annual Audit Report (AAR) as of December 31, 2019, recommendations therewith were not yet fully implemented (See details in Part III).



Further, as stated in the Notes to Financial Statements, the Due from Government-Owned and/or Controlled Corporations in the amount of P1,128,940.99 under Fund 01 represents the over remittance to GSIS as a result of reconciliation. This has been reflected in the Trial Balance of the university since Dec. 31, 2014. Ironically, per our confirmation letter with the GSIS as attached herewith as Appendix B, it turned out that as of October 31, 2020, MSU - Iligan Institute of Technology due premiums inclusive of interests from July 1997 to aforementioned date are amounting to Ninety-Five Million Seven Hundred Eighty-Eight Thousand Twenty-Seven and 76/100 (P95,788,027.76), herewith attached as Appendix C is a Letter of GSIS to the institute of which a copy was furnished to us. 



Nonetheless, for the period ended December 31, 2020, MSU-IIT deducted from its personnel a total of P49,950,190.15 GSIS premiums and remitted the same with GSIS as of year-end. On the other hand, the total government share in the GSIS premiums of its officials and employees amounting to P51,995,008.78  was also remitted as of December 31, 2020.

Status of Implementation

2019 AAR

	AAR # 1

The reported balance of  Construction in Progress account amounting to P605,076,647.61 as of December 31, 2019 is inconsistent  to Chapter 10, Section 8(g) and Section 27(c) of Government Accounting  Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies,  Volume I dated January 24, 2014  thus,  impairing the accuracy and reliability of the Financial Statements.

We recommended that:

a)	Accountant should reclassify the completed and turned-over projects which were taken up in the books under Construction in Progress account to appropriate asset account; 

b)	Accountant should recognize their corresponding depreciation and recorded in the books of accounts; 

c)	Accounting Division should keep CIPLC for each project; and

d)	Physical Plant Division Office should submit promptly the required pertinent documents upon completion of the constructed projects to the Accounting Office for proper recording thereof.

PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

Attention:	ALMA G. MARANDA

AAO



Dear Dr. Tanggol,



Relative to the Government Service Insurance System’s consistent thrust to ensure updatedness of Agency’s premium remittances and insurance coverage of all government members, we are respectfully informing you of your Agency’s total outstanding premium obligation to the System. As of October 31, 2020, MSU - Iligan Institute of Technology due premiums inclusive of interests from July 1997 to aforementioned date are amounting to Ninety Five Million Seven Hundred Eighty Eight Thousand Twenty Seven and 76/100 (Php  95,788,027.76).  Hereunder is the breakdown:



Personal Share (PS), Government Share (GS) and Employees Compensation (EC) PREMIUMS



Interest Due on PS, GS and EC Premiums



T O T A L



Php  17,698,889.68 *



Php   78,089,138.08



Php  95,788,027.76



 *Subject for reconciliation and adjustment 

       

We wish to remind you that under Section 14 and 15 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of the Republic Act 8291, it is provided that:  



“Section 14 Remittance of Contributions: 



Sec. 14.1. Each government agency shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and government agency’s contributions within the first ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply.  The remittance by the government agency of the contributions to the GSIS shall take priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except salaries and wages of its employees. 



Sec. 14.3. The said amounts shall be remitted to the GSIS within the first ten (10) days of the calendar month when the deductions were effected, accompanied by supporting lists in the form prescribed by the GSIS. 



Sec. 15 Interest on Delayed Remittance: 



The government agency shall be imposed interest for every month of delay, or a portion thereof, in the remittance of the monthly premium contributions and other amounts due the GSIS, at the rate of 2% per month simple interest.  Such interest will begin to accrue at the end of the month following the due month.”



We hereby demand the immediate payment or settlement of the above stated amount – your Agency’s outstanding obligation with the System to refrain from further accrual of interest, thus avoiding its adverse effect on the employees’ Period with Premium Payment (PPP), as well as to prevent the filing of administrative, criminal and collection cases against your agency by our Legal Services Group (LSG) in Manila. 

   

For further inquiries, you may email us at geosin@gsis.gov.ph and/or nddimaporo@gsis.gov.ph or contact our Billing, Collection and Reconciliation Personnel, Ms. Glynn E. Osin, Officer-in-Charge, BCR Division, or Mr. Norsalem ‘Alex’ D. Dimaporo, Team Leader of the Billing and Collection Unit, GSIS Iligan Branch Office at telephone number (063) 221-8698.



Thank you.
