The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the consolidated financial statements of the GHQ, AFP as at December 31, 2020.



E)	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

	

1)	The balances of Cash in Bank – Local Currency Current Account  and Cash in Bank – Local Currency Savings Account amounting to ₱5,774,658,348.88 and ₱1,465,682,806.26, respectively, as at December 31, 2020 had been rendered inaccurate due to several omissions in recognition of fiscal events of substantial amounts in the books of GHQ Central Office (GHQ-CO), Provident Fund, AFP Real Estate Office (AFPREO), AFP Pension and Gratuity Management Center (AFPGMC), AFP Modernization Act Trust Fund (AFPMATF), Presidential Security Group (PSG), AFP Health Service Command (AFPHSC), Central Command (CENTCOM) and Western Command (WESCOM) contrary to Section 6, Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume 1. (Observation No. 1)

	

	We recommended that Management: a) require the Accountants of GHQ-CO, Provident Fund, AFPREO, AFPMATF, AFPPGMC, PSG, CENTCOM and WESCOM to verify and take up necessary reconciling items in the books, and make representations with the Land Bank of the Philippines servicing branch to call attention on the provision of debit and credit memo details; b) require WESCOM to utilize the LandBank we-Access facility particularly the viewing, printing or downloading of statement of accounts for all accounts maintained with the LBP for timely reconciliation of the agency's records with the actual bank balance; c) direct AFPHSC Financial Service Unit to determine details of unidentified payroll account balance and to process, if warranted, its corresponding Advice to Debit Account in favor of the payees.  Otherwise, the balance should be remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr); d) form an ad hoc group that will dedicate time and effort to determine details of inactive bank accounts and unreconciled balances; and draft recommended entries to close balances of the said accounts; and e) deliberate on the action to be taken on the unutilized Medical Assistance Program fund of PSG given the considerable period that it has remained unused and inform the Department of Health that its initial release is still intact.

	

2)	The balance of Due from National Government Agencies of ₱1,369,022,428.33 as at December 31, 2020 has been rendered inaccurate due to a discrepancy of ₱218,582,249.06, between records of AFP Accounting Center, PSG and Implementing Agencies (IAs).  (Observation No. 3)



We recommended that Management: a)	exercise caution in the transfer of funds to PS-DBM given the substantial amounts of unliquidated transfers from prior years; b) direct the Accountant of GHQ-CO, AFPREO and PSG to record in the books the direct deposit/refund of the PS-DBM to the Bureau of the Treasury upon obtaining supporting documentation; ii.	provide documents to PS-DBM relative to the unrecorded fund transfers amounting to ₱422,342.14 and request that the same be taken up in the books; verify and record the receipts of supplies and materials worth ₱772,665.63; conduct regular reconciliation with implementing agencies to ensure prompt detection of discrepancies, if any; and request implementing agencies to provide copies of liquidation reports and supporting documents for accounts already liquidated per confirmation and to return unused funds; c) request for authority to write-off dormant unliquidated fund transfers following the guidelines provided under COA Circular 2016-005;  and d) direct the GHQ Supply Accountable Officer (SAO) to: maintain a record per unit/office to monitor advance payments made and corresponding deliveries/receipts of supplies, and ensure prompt submission of Delivery Receipts and supporting documents to AFPAC; and request PS-DBM to expedite delivery of the remaining procured items and to return any excess payments.



3)	Projects/equipment/supplies/services procured through outsourcing to the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) remained unimplemented/undelivered as of December 31, 2020; thus, depriving the government and intended users of expected benefits that would have been derived therefrom.  Moreover, book balances of fund transfers at the GHQ-CO and AFPHSC have a discrepancy of ₱63,901,347.63 with that of the PITC records. (Observation No. 4)



We recommended that Management: a)	make a written representation to PITC to expedite procurement, delivery and completion of the remaining items; otherwise, demand for refund of unutilized funds to be remitted to the BTr; b) require the AFPAC and 6th FASU to reconcile regularly with PITC and prepare necessary JEVs to take-up valid reconciling items; and c) request the PITC to notify Management whenever charges or credits were made in the account of the latter, and forward supporting documents to the AFPAC.



4)		The weak enforcement of liquidation/settlement of transferred funds, and inadequate reconciliation with Operating Units resulted in the accumulation of unliquidated fund transfers of ₱118,392,009.30, of which ₱5,638,707.53 are dormant.  Further, a variance of ₱6,775,729.88 exists between the books of GHQ-CO, AFPREO and Operating Units. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended that Management direct the AFP Accounting Center to: a)	 make constant follow-ups to operating units for the submission of liquidation reports and return any unused funds particularly for projects or activities that are already completed; b) conduct regular reconciliation with counterparts and prepare necessary JEVs to take up valid reconciling items; and c) request for authority to write-off dormant unliquidated fund transfers following the guidelines provided in COA Circular 2016-005.



5)		The accuracy, completeness, existence, and collectability of Other Receivables account balance of ₱499,086,572.48 could not be ascertained due to: a) unrecorded pension overpayments of ₱3,187,078.28; b) overdue accounts of ₱128,368,294.64 of which ₱52,708,387.55 are dormant accounts; and c) presence of negative subsidiary leger balance of ₱4,094,581.36. (Observation No. 7)

	

	We recommended that Management: a)	require the AFPPGMC to submit a periodic report of overpayments due for recovery as well as recoveries already made to the AFP Accounting Center so that the latter will be able to record said transactions; b) advise the GHQ ONAF to: i. fast track the commissioning of an automated billing system that will, among others, promptly impose/record penalties for late/non-payment of arrears; enable monitoring of outstanding concessionaire balances; and identify possible reconciling items with the AFPAC; ii. consistently issue demand letters to concessionaires with arrears (copy furnished the Office of the Auditor) and ensure strict implementation of other provisions embodied in SOP 05-16; and c)	require the GHQ-CO, AFPREO, PSG, AFPHSC and CENTCOM to explore other possible ways to collect overdue accounts, if all efforts undertaken prove to be futile, file a request for write-off following the guidelines in COA Circular 2016-005.

	

6)		The balance of Inventory accounts totaling ₱10,149,821,564.88 as at year-end has been rendered inaccurate due to: a) unrecorded consumptions/issuances of various inventory items; b) presence of unreconciled ₱613,190,206.69 balance; c) misclassification of inventories; and d) non-submission of Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI). (Observation No. 8)

	

	We recommended the following remedial measures: a)	AFP Accounting Center (AFPAC) and AFPHSC to: i. determine cause/s behind the unrecorded issuances of supplies and materials inventory items despite being covered by Property Transfer Reports, Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) and Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI), and to implement steps to take up unrecorded issuances in the books; ii. effect necessary adjusting entries to correct misclassifications and erroneous recording of inventories; b) GHQ SAO to ensure that issuances of semi-expendable property are covered with Inventory Custodian Slip to be promptly forwarded to the AFPAC for proper recording; c) Office of the Quarter Master General (OTQMG) to promptly forward to AFPAC statements of account on fuel usage from fleet card transactions and all documents relative to FOL deliveries and issuances; d) AFPAC, OTQMG and GHQ SAO to conduct periodic reconciliation of records and analyze balances of SLs composing Inventory accounts labeled as “Unreconciled” and draw necessary accounting entries as details are identified; e)	 GHQ SAO and OTQMG to effect timely preparation of PTRs/RISs/RSMI and its prompt submission to AFPAC; f) Inventory Committee of WESCOM to reconcile with the accounting and property records the net variance of ₱2,848,044.19 to ensure reliability and accuracy of inventory items recorded in the Inventory accounts in the FS; and g) OTQMG, GHQ SAO and Inventory Committee of the Unit to ensure the conduct of physical count of inventories for FOL at least twice a year and submit copy of the RPCI to the Office of the Auditor not later than July 31 and January 31 of each year.

	

7)		The accuracy, completeness, and valuation of the PPE account balance of ₱125,414,059,434.27 had been adversely affected by various weaknesses that are contrary to the provisions Chapter 5 of the GAM, Volume I. (Observation No. 9)

	

We recommended that Management: a)	direct the Accountants of GHQ-CO, AFPMATF, PSG, AFPHSC, PMA, SOLCOM, NOLCOM and WESCOM to: i. draw accounting entries to record receipt and transfer of PPE, derecognition of demolished office building, reclassification of all completed projects to its proper PPE account, and to correct the accumulated depreciation balances of PPE accounts; ii. analyze details of PPE accounts with negative balances and draw the necessary accounting entries; iii. reconcile their records with the SAO and make the necessary adjustments; b) direct the SAO and concerned units to forward all documents regarding unrecorded PPE to the accounting units for proper recording of receipts and transfers of PPE; c) explore the possibility of forming a Technical Working Group that will focus on the analysis and verification of undocumented accounts; d) direct the Accountants, SAO and Inventory Committee to conduct and finish the physical count of PPE, and submit the RPCPPE for validation;  e) direct the SAO and 7th AFP FASU to coordinate with each other for recording of disposed unserviceable PPE, including proper accomplishment of the IIRUP; and f) notify COA audit team prior to any disposal of PPE is undertaken to allow inspection thereof in compliance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445.

Moreover, the balance includes ₱7,610,163.20 in accountabilities of accountable officers (AOs) who were either inactive, retired, AWOL, deceased or separated from the service; and ₱183,580.38 in negative SL balances. (Observation No. 10)

12)		The non-recognition of the application of deposits and/or delivery and acceptance of supplies/equipment/services totaling ₱2,793,750,330.37 at AFPMATF misstated the Guaranty Deposits account balance of ₱8,174,739,731.04 contrary to Section 7 Chapter 19 of the GAM Volume 1.  Moreover, transferred funds to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) was over by US$48,151.63 or ₱2,455,733.13. (Observation No. 14)

	

	We recommended that Management: a)	advise the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, J4 and AFP Accounting Center (AFPAC) to discuss/settle issues on the ₱2,793,750,330.37 unrecorded transactions for deliveries already made, and the ₱2,455,733.13 excess fund transfer to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY); b)	 based on the results of discussions made in (a), direct the AFPAC (subject to availability of adequate supporting documents) to draw accounting entries to record completed transactions and the adjustment for the excess fund transfer; c)	 require the AFPAC and OJ4 to periodically hold coordination meetings to thresh out issues that hamper timely recognition of guaranty deposit transactions; and d) ensure that the AFP or NG has control or possession of funds transferred to the FRBNY as payment for the project that was cancelled (US$485,659.00 or ₱4,828,451.00); the unintentional overpayment (US$48,151.63 or ₱2,455,733.13); and residual funds from LOA PI-B-UAI and PI-B-VCD.

	

13)		The accuracy of the Accounts Payable balance of ₱519,238,197.40 as at December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained due to accounting errors and deficiencies of GHQ-CO and AFPMATF-CO such as :  a) misinterpreted accounting treatment of transactions; b) presence of negative SL balances of ₱1,235,284.87; c) non-reversion of long outstanding payables to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit); and d) set-up of payable without corresponding allotment contrary to the GAM and Section 98 of PD 1445.

(Observation No. 17)

	

	We recommended that Management require the AFPPGMC to: a) conduct an assessment of causes of erroneous data generated by the PenMIS, whether there is failure on the human intervention aspect (errors in encoding data or failure to update pensioner information); or a failure or limitation of the system to process data despite accurate encoding; b) formulate (in collaboration with the Noncurrent Records Division, Office of the Adjutant General) responsive and attainable courses of action that will address the weaknesses that result in over/ underpayments, errors and other difficulties that hinder the delivery of efficient service to its clients; and c) closely monitor over/underpayments to its clients for the purpose of implementing corrective action thereon, i.e. to recover overpayments and conversely, to settle underpayments from/to its clients.

	

15)	Twenty bank accounts with book balance of ₱1,812,797,567.87 deposited with the LBP, DBP and UCPB are continuously retained despite the absence of express written authority from the Permanent Committee as required in Section 10 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA. (Observation No. 21)

	

	We recommended that Management promptly comply with the cited rules and close the stated bank accounts, or obtain authority from the Permanent Committee for its retention.

	

16)	Scholarship fund, donation, interest income and other unutilized funds totaling ₱469,124,099.81 were not remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury contrary to Sections 5 and 6 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA. (Observation No. 22)

We recommended that Management formulate and implement an action plan to put back on track completion of pending projects and to enforce, where applicable, the employment of available remedies provided under the Revised IRR of RA 9184 such as the imposition of liquidated damages.



18)	The ₱4,342,889.23 balance of fund transfers to implementing agencies (IAs) intended for the Yolanda and Marawi victims/beneficiaries remained unliquidated for more than two years. (Observation No. 28)



We recommended that Management require: a)	the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, J1 to address the issues that continue to restrict the disbursement of the remaining Marawi fund; otherwise, require PA to return the same so that it can be deposited to the BTr; and b) the PA for the submission of liquidation reports for the Yolanda Fund.
