OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Financial  
 

Unrecorded issuances of Supplies and Materials  

1. Supplies and Materials issued to requisitioners/end-users totaling ₱492,634.00 
were not recognized in the books of accounts as these were not reported in the 

Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) used as basis by the 

Accounting Office in preparing Journal Entry Voucher to record the issuance 

of inventories on stock, thus affecting the fair presentation of the Office 

Supplies and Materials Inventory and Other Supplies and Materials Expenses 

accounts.   

 

Section 7, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM provides that “when inventories 

are sold, exchanged, or distributed, their carrying amount shall be recognized as an 

expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. If there is no 

related revenue, the expense is recognized when the goods are distributed or the 

related service is rendered.” 

 

Likewise, Section 17, Chapter 8, Volume I of the same Manual enumerates 

various records, forms and reports prescribed for use, which includes among others, 

the RSMI. The RSMI is used by the Accounting Unit to prepare JEV to record the 

issue of stock. 

 

Verification showed that the following supplies and materials totaling 

₱492,634.00 issued to various requisitioners/end-users from September to 

December 2020 were not included in the RSMIs for that period, thus were not 

recognized in the books of accounts. This was the time when the office lockdown 

was imposed and work from home arrangement was implemented at the crucial 

period of the COVID 19 pandemic.

Total 492,634.00 

 

It was also noted that the RSMI prepared by the Supply Officer was not in 

accordance with the prescribed format shown in Appendix 64, Volume II of the 

GAM. It did not include the “Unit Cost” portion, which is essential in counter-



37 

 

checking the total cost of issuance per journal entry voucher (JEV) prepared by the 

Accounting Unit. 

 

The unrecorded issuance of inventory items in the RSMI resulted in the 

overstatement and understatement of the accounts Office Supplies and Materials 

Inventory and the Other Supplies and Materials Expenses, respectively, by 

₱492,634.00. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to:   

 

a) instruct the Supply Officer to check the completeness of the RSMIs 
against the Requisition and Issue Slip before submission to the 

Accountant for recording purposes;  

 

b) require the Accountant to prepare an adjusting entry for the unreported 
issuance of supplies and materials in CY 2020; and 

 

c) prepare the RSMIs in accordance with the format shown in Appendix 64, 
Volume II of the GAM.    

 
 

Unsubmitted disbursements vouchers  
 

2. The non-submission to the Auditor’s Office of the 76 disbursement vouchers 
(DV) for the month of December 2020 totaling ₱17,550,475.37 or 18.35 percent 

of the total expenses for the year, prevented the Audit Team to establish the 

correctness and reliability of the affected accounts’ balances in the financial 

statements as at year end. 

 

Section 100. Reports of disbursing officers in a government agency. 

Disbursing officers in any government agency shall render monthly reports of their 

transactions pursuant to regulations of the Commission to be submitted not later 

than the fifth day of the ensuing month to the auditor concerned who shall conduct 

the necessary examination and audit within thirty days from receipt thereof. 

 

Section 7.2.1(a) of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 

provides that the Chief Accountant, bookkeeper or other authorized official 

performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall 

ensure that the reports and supporting documents submitted by the accountable 

officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the 

Auditor within the fist ten days of the ensuing month. 

 

The 76 DVs processed and paid for December 2020 with a total of 

₱17,550,475.37, which is 18.35 percent of the total expenses for the year, were not 

submitted by the Bookkeeper to the Audit Team as of the audit report preparation.

Inquiry revealed that although the DVs and OBRs were prepared, these were 

not signed on time by the authorized signatories, due to the implementation of the 

AWA and the prolonged lockdown at the NEB building where the PLLO main 

office is located, brough about by the COVID 19.  

 

The non-submission of the assigned personnel to submit the DVs to the 

Auditor’s Office for more than three months, prevented the Audit Team to conduct 

timely post audit and review of all expenditures covered by the 76 DVs. Hence,  

prevented the Audit Team to establish the correctness and reliability of the affected 

accounts’ balances in the financial statements as at year end.    

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the assigned 

personnel to submit the DVs and its supporting documents to the Audit Team 

within the reglementary period. 

 

 

B. Compliance Audit 
 

Undisposed obsolete/expired inventory items and unserviceable/idle PPE 
  
3. Unaccounted obsolete/expired and non-moving inventory items, and various 

unserviceable/idle PPE, with a total carrying amount of ₱68,706.38, stored in 

rented storage rooms, were not disposed for than three years, depriving the 

agency of any benefit or income that may be derived from its disposal, and 

continuously incurring unnecessary rental expenses. Moreover, no Inventory 

Report and IIRUP for the identified unserviceable PPE items was submitted, 

contrary to Section 40, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM. 

 

The Manual on Disposal of Government Property as embodied in NBC No. 

425 dated January 28, 1992 was issued to guide agencies in their disposal 

undertakings. Part I (A) thereof provides, among others, that disposal occurs when a 

piece of equipment or property can no longer provide efficient service or, though 

still working, has been rendered useless due to obsolescence.  Disposal proceedings 

should be immediately initiated to avoid further deterioration of the property and 

the consequent depreciation in its value. A systematic and timely disposal will yield 

benefits in terms of a higher appraised value/selling price and enabling storage 

areas available for other purposes. 

 



39 

 

Moreover, Section 40, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM provides that a 

property is said to be unserviceable if it is no longer capable of providing the entity 

with future economic benefits or service potential. PPE reported in the IIRUP shall 

be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and 

Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation).  

 

The following were determined to be unserviceable properties which includes 

the unserviceable properties under the Other Assets account:   

 

Particulars Carrying Amount

      2  units Executive Chair 1,365.00 

      1 unit Electronic Typewriter 1,528.20

     2 sets Sofa  

 

1,600.00 

       Total  68,706.38 

 

For CY 2020, due to the pandemic, no RPCIs were submitted to the Audit 

Team, such that obsolete, expired and non-moving inventory items were not 

accounted for. These includes office dividers, which were disassembled from the 

HOR Office sometimes in CY 2016 when PLLO was expel from the PPLO office at 

located there, obsolete printers, worn-out office tables and chairs, and other 

obsolete forms and scrap materials. 

 

On the other hand, although the Inventory Committee submitted the Report of 

Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) for CY 2020, the “Remarks” portion was not 

filled-up; hence, other relevant information relative to the PPE are missing 

including its conditions and whereabouts.  This could be attributed to the lack of 

proper training on asset and property management of the Acting Property/Supply 

Officer who was designated only in January 2020.  

 

Inspection of two storage rooms rented by the agency along J. P. Laurel, 

Manila for ₱15,000 a month per room or a total of ₱360,000 a year, since October 

2018, revealed that various obsolete, expired/non-moving inventories, and no 

longer used and unserviceable PPE of the agency are stored therein.  

 

Had Management prioritize the disposal of its obsolete/non-moving 

inventories and unserviceable/idle PPEs, the agency could have saved ₱360,000.00 

in rental expenses for the year, and further deterioration of the property could have 

been avoided. A systematic and timely disposal will yield benefits in terms of a 

higher appraised value/selling price. 

 



40 

 

Further, the Property Unit had not prepared the IIRUP as of December 31, 

2020, which should have been the basis of the Accounting Office to drop the 

unserviceable PPEs from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant 

and Equipment Less Accumulated Depreciation. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Property 

Officer to: 

 

a) account for the obsolete/non-moving inventories, and prepare the 
corresponding IIRUP;  

 

b) submit the IIRUP to the Accounting Office for the dropping of 
unserviceable PPEs from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-PPE, 

and to the Disposal Committee for their disposal to avoid further 

deterioration, and avoid payment of storage rooms rental; and 

 

c) Require the newly designated acting Property/Supplier Officer to attend 
trainings and seminars on asset and property management, to enhance 

his skills.

The (AWA) has contributed to the increase in the number of committee/ 

monitoring reports due to a more focused environment in a work-from-home set-

up. Physical energy is conserved, absent traveling time in going to office thus 

creating a space for a more relaxed and focused execution of a task. Time 

conserved in traveling has contributed to an increased time to accomplish reports, 

which resulted in the implementation of the 10 programmed activities.
