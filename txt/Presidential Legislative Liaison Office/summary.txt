these concerns through the various processes. It is mandated to promote the 

presidential legislative initiatives and other Administration-sponsored priority

and conflict resolutions, preparation of Presidential urgent certification of 

priority bills up to the ceremonial signing of the same;

presidential appointees to the Cabinet;

programs;

31, 2020, PLLO has a total manpower of 78, consisting of 26 regular plantilla

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of the PLLO for the CY 2020, 

except for the unsubmitted 76 disbursement vouchers totaling ₱17,550,475.37 or 

18.35 percent of the total expenses in CY 2020.  It was conducted to: a) ascertain 

the level of assurance that may be placed on the Management’s assertion(s) on the 

financial statements; b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as extent of 

compliance on the applicable laws, rules and regulations; c) recommend agency’s 

improvement opportunities; and d) determine the extent of implementations of prior 

year’s audit recommendations. Moreover, the audit was conducted in accordance 

with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). 

 

 

E. Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements    
 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements due to the non-submission of the 76 Disbursement Vouchers 

(DVs) for the month of December 2020 totaling ₱17,550,475.37 or 18.35 percent of 

the total expenses in CY 2020 which prevented the Audit Team to establish the 

correctness and reliability of the affected accounts’ balances in the financial 

statements as at year end.    

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations  

 
The following are the significant audit observations and the corresponding 

recommendations that were discussed with the Management officials concerned, 

details of which are discussed in Part II of this report:  

 
1.   Supplies and Materials issued to requisitioners/end-users totaling ₱492,634.00 

were not recognized in the books of accounts as these were not reported in the 

Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) used as basis by the Accounting 

Office in preparing Journal Entry Voucher to record the issuance of inventories 

on stock, thus affecting the fair presentation of the Office Supplies and Materials 

Inventory and Other Supplies and Materials Expenses accounts.   

 

We recommended and Management agreed to:   

 

a) instruct the Supply Officer to check the completeness of the RSMIs against 
the Requisition and Issue Slips (RIS) before submission to the Accountant 

for recording purposes;  

 



v 

 

 

b) require the Accountant to prepare adjusting entry for the unreported 
issuance of supplies and materials in CY 2020; and 

 

c) prepare the RSMIs in accordance with the format shown in Appendix 64, 
Volume II of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM).    

 

2.  Unaccounted obsolete/expired and non-moving inventory items, and various 
unserviceable/idle PPE, with a total carrying amount of ₱68,706.38, stored in 

rented storage rooms, were not disposed for than three years, depriving the 

agency of any benefit or income that may be derived from its disposal, and 

continuously incurring unnecessary rental expenses. Moreover, no Inventory 

Report and IIRUP for the identified unserviceable PPE items was submitted, 

contrary to Section 40, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Property Officer to: 

 

a) account for the obsolete/non-moving inventories, and prepare the 
corresponding IIRUP;  

 

b) submit the IIRUP to the Accounting Office for the dropping of unserviceable 
PPEs from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-PPE, and to the Disposal 

Committee for their disposal to avoid further deterioration, and avoid payment 

of storage rooms rental; and 

 

c) Require the newly designated acting Property/Supplier Officer to attend 
trainings and seminars on asset and property management, to enhance his 

skills.   

 

 

G. Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 

All the four audit recommendations contained in the CY 2019 Annual Audit 

Report (AAR) were implemented. The details are presented in Part III of this report.
