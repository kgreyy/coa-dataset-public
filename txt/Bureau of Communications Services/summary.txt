   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 

A.   Introduction 
 

The Bureau of Communications Services (BCS) traces its roots from the 

defunct Bureau of National and Foreign Information (BNFI) created in 1973 under 

the Department of National Information (DNI).  The BNFI was charged with the 

overall coordination and integration of government-wide programs locally and 

internationally.  In 1980, the DNI was reorganized and became the Office of Media 

Affairs (OMA).  After the EDSA Revolution in 1986, OMA was abolished and 

created in its stead was the Office of the Press Secretary (OPS) by virtue of 

Executive Order (EO) No. 92, placing in its direct management all information 

agencies, including the BNFI. 

 

On July 25, 1987, President Corazon Aquino signed E.O. No. 297 

reorganizing the OPS and its attached bureaus and agencies.  Consequently, BNFI 

was abolished and BCS was created.  In 2010, President Benigno Aquino signed 

E.O. No. 4 reorganizing and renaming the OPS as the Presidential Communications 

Operations Office (PCOO), the mother agency of BCS. 

 

Among the functions of the BCS are as follows:  

 

a. Develop and conduct a public information program that will enhance 
awareness and secure positive acceptance and support of the 

programs and activities of the Government and the Presidency; 

 

b. Coordinate information dissemination on programs and projects 
including the campaigns directed to the Bureau’s target public; 

 

c. Supervise the over-all conceptualization and production of special 
publications and audio-visual information/communication materials 

for the Government and the Presidency; and 

 

d. Supervise the conceptualization, production, printing and 
dissemination of all information/communication materials and 

publications in support of the activities of Government and the 

Presidency. 

   

   BCS is currently headed by Ms. Ma. Florinda Princess E. Duque, Director 

IV.  It consists of five divisions, namely, the: (1) Office of the Director, (2) 

Planning and Research Division, (3) Special Production Division, (4) Special 

Operations Division and (5) Finance and Administrative Division.

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the significant audit observations and corresponding 

recommendations, details of which are discussed in Part II of this report.  

Management views and comments were incorporated in the report, where 

appropriate. 

 

1. Submission of monthly liquidation reports to PCOO were delayed by one 
month to seven months while no monthly progress report on Philippine 

Identification System (PhilSys) project-related activities was submitted to 

PCOO contrary to the pertinent MOA provisions. Thus, the status of 

utilization of the fund transfer and accomplishment of the BCS for the project 

could not be properly monitored by PCOO. (Observation No. 1) 

 

          We recommended and Management agreed to require the Head of the 

Production Unit and the Accountant to:  

 

a. prepare the weekly progress report, as required in the amended MOA and 
submit the same so that issues/concerns could be immediately addressed; 

and  

 

b.  ensure that the monthly liquidation reports are submitted immediately in 

the succeeding month. 
 

2. Actual expenditures incurred for the hiring of personnel for the two BCS 
offices exceeded the allocated budget therefor, contrary to a sound cash 

management/budget planning. (Observation No. 2) 

  

We recommended and Management agreed to require the OIC, Head of the 

Finance and Administration (FAD) to ensure that the subject PCOO 

transferred funds are only used for PhilSys project-related expenditures and 

that the same are utilized in accordance with the approved work and financial 

plan. Moreover, ensure that the services of the hired personnel are utilized for 

PhilSys project activities. 

 

3.    Payments to a legal consultant totaling P550,000.00 were made without the 

written authority and acquiescence from the Office of the Solicitor General 

(OSG), and concurrence from COA on the hiring of a Legal Consultant, in 

violation of COA Circular No. 95-011 dated December 4, 1995. (Observation 

No. 3) 

                    

We recommended that Management: 

 

a.   hold the concerned agency officials who signed/approved the COS, 
approved the payments, and certified as to the necessity and lawfulness 

of the expenses and completeness of supporting documents liable for the 



v 
 

refund of salaries of the Legal Consultant in view of the lack of the 

OSG’s written authority and acquiescence, and COA’s concurrence; and 

 

b.   henceforth, ensure compliance with the provisions of Circular No. 95-
011 before engaging the services of a private lawyer. 

 

4. The OIC, Head of FAD also performed disbursing functions contrary to the 
principle of sound internal control on the segregation of duties and functions, 

thereby, creating opportunities to conceal errors or irregularities. 

(Observation No. 4) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

a. immediately designate another agency officer/personnel to handle the 
cash advance ensuring that no incompatible functions are performed in 

order to provide effective check and balance, and to prevent one person 

to conceal errors and/or irregularities; and  

 

b. direct the OIC, Head of FAD to liquidate the cash advance and return any 
remaining balance of his accountability, without delay, to the Cashier.   

 

5. One hundred nineteen (119) paid Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) involving 
the total amount of P1,479,962.74 were not supported with adequate 

documentary requirements prescribed under COA Circular No. 2012-001 

dated June 14, 2012, hence, the validity, propriety and regularity of the 

transactions were not ascertained. (Observation No. 5) 

  

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

b.   require the concerned payees and/or responsible personnel or office to 
immediately submit the lacking documentary requirements to the Audit 

Team to effect proper review of the transactions; and  

 

c.   henceforth, instruct the Accountant to ensure that the DVs are supported 
with applicable documentary requirements for each type of transaction as 

prescribed under COA Circular no 2012-001, and refrain from processing 

claims with incomplete documentation. 

 

 

G. Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 

The 11 audit recommendations contained in the CY 2019 Annual Audit 

Report (AAR) were implemented by Management. The details are presented in 

Part III of this report.
