OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
 

A. Financial and Compliance 
 

Delayed /non- submission of monthly reports to PCOO 

 

1. Submission of monthly liquidation reports to PCOO were delayed by one month 
to seven months while no monthly progress report on Philippine Identification 

System (PhilSys) project-related activities was submitted to PCOO contrary to 

the pertinent MOA provisions. Thus, status of fund transfer and 

accomplishment of the agency for the project could not be properly monitored 

by PCOO. 
 

On April 8, 2019, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) and PCOO entered 

into an agreement where the PCOO and its attached agencies, including the BCS, 

shall develop and produce the multimedia communication requirements for the 

PhilSys project.  

 

On September 27, 2019, PCOO and BCS entered into a MOA with validity 

until December 31, 2020, where the latter shall be responsible, among others, for the 

following:  

a)    Monitor, and execute, together with the PSA and PCOO the 

implementation of the services under this MOA and ensure completion of 

projects in accordance with the communications Plan of the PCOO and 

PSA;  

b)  Provide the printing and actual production of information   and 

communications materials as needed by the PCOO and PSA, including 

the freight and dissemination thereof;  

c)   Assist and provide logistics support to the PCOO, PSA, and Philippine 

Information Agency (PIA) in the conduct of the roadshows, media 

forums, and other such analogous events under the communications plan 

of the PCOO and PSA;  

d)    Liquidate to the PCOO on a monthly basis all expenses made in relation 

to the execution of activities under this MOA; and  

e)   Submit to the PCOO, on a monthly basis, progress reports undertaken 

relative to the execution of the activities under this MOA.  

 

While the PCOO shall provide a budget of P60 million to cover the necessary 

expenses for the execution of the undertakings of the BCS under the MOA. However, 



27 

 

only P30 million shall be initially transferred by the PCOO to BCS representing the 

first tranche.  

 

The first tranche of P30 million was received by BCS on November 21, 2019, 

which was deposited to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr). On December 2, 2019, BCS 

requested DBM for the issuance of Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) but the DBM in 

its letter dated December 4, 2019 returned the request to BCS without prejudice to its 

resubmission in January 2020 considering there are only few remaining days in 

December. It was on January 20, 2020 that the BCS resubmitted the request for 

issuance of NCA, which was released in February 2020.      

 

Inspection of pertinent records showed that BCS was delayed in the submission 

of monthly liquidations of the PCOO transferred funds, ranging from one month to 

seven months, with details shown below:

                           Note:  No utilization yet from November 2019 to January 2020 since the NCA 

was received only in February 2020 

 

On the other hand, no monthly progress report was prepared and submitted by 

BCS to PCOO. Management attributed the delayed submission of liquidation reports 

and non-submission of progress report to the following:  

 

a) Due to COVID-19 pandemic that placed the entire Metro Manila under 
lockdown, instead of the required monthly progress report, the same had 

been submitted only whenever PCOO requested, and status of updates were 

also given during online meetings called by PCOO.  

 

Management, however, did not provide the Audit Team any document to 

support said action.    

 

b) The current alternative working arrangement, i.e., skeleton workforce of 
the officers and employees of BCS, made it difficult for them to submit on 

a monthly basis. The personnel responsible for the liquidations and 



28 

 

processing of documents, some are senior citizens are mostly not available 

due to the situation. 

 

It was learned that the MOA was amended in January 2021 to reflect vital 

changes, part of which is the submission of the progress reports on a weekly basis.  

The amendment also extended the validity of the MOA until May 2021.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Head of the 

Production Unit and the Accountant to:  

 

a. prepare the weekly progress report, as required in the amended MOA 
and submit the same so that issues/concerns could be immediately 

addressed; and  

 

b.   ensure that the monthly liquidation reports are submitted immediately 

in the succeeding month. 
 

 

Actual expenditures for the hiring of personnel exceeded the allocated budget 

 

2. Actual expenditures incurred for the hiring of job order personnel  for the two 
BCS offices in relation to PhilSys project  exceeded the allocated budget 

therefor, contrary to a sound cash management/budget planning. 

 

Pursuant to PD No. 1445, “The Head of a government agency and all those who 

exercise authority over the financial affairs, transactions, and operations of the 

agency, shall take care of the management and utilization of government resources in 

accordance with law and regulation, and that they are safeguarded against loss or 

wastage to ensure efficient, economical, and effective operations of the government.” 

 

Per approved monthly cash program for the first tranche of P30 million of the 

PhilSys project, P2,648,399.00 shall be for Personnel Allocation, as follows:  

 

Office/Division Amount (P) 

Office of the Director (OD) 646,751.00 

Finance and Administrative Division (FAD) 601,648.00 

Special Operations Division (SOD) 780,000.00 

Special Production Division (SPD) 620,000.00 

          Total 2,648,399.00 

 

Audit of disbursements disclosed that the actual expenditures incurred for the 

hiring of personnel charged to PhilSys funds totaled P2,412,315.73. While said 

amount did not exceed the total budget, the actual expenditures for the two BCS 

offices, however, were more than their respective budget allocation, as shown on the 

next page:

Total 15 2,648,399.00 2,412,316.73 236,083.27 

 

Based on the monthly cash program covering the period from January to May 

2020, the hired personnel would only be engaged by the BCS for a period of four 

months. However, audit revealed that of the 15 hired personnel, 13 were actually paid 

for more than four months as of December 2020, as presented below:

FAD

2 6 July to December 

2 11 February to December 

SPD 

1 5 February to June 

3 7 February to August 

 

It should be mentioned that the hired personnel for OD consists of a Legal 

Consultant and two Social Media Manager while FAD hired personnel were mostly 

Administrative Assistant.  

 

As of December 31, 2020, the budget for personnel allocation was almost 

depleted which could pose problem in the succeeding payments of the hired personnel 

considering that the MOA with PCOO was extended until May 31, 2021.  

Consequently, the personnel allocation would be augmented from other fund 

allocation which could affect the implementation of the other activities for Philsys.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the OIC, Head of 

FAD to ensure that the subject PCOO transferred funds are only used for 

PhilSys related expenditures and that the same are utilized in accordance with 

the approved work and financial plan.  Moreover, ensure that the services of the 

hired personnel are utilized for PhilSys activities.

Unauthorized hiring of private lawyer 

 

3. Payments of a legal consultant totaling P550,000 were paid without the written 
authority and acquiescence from the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), and 

concurrence from COA required under COA Circular No. 95-011 dated 

December 4, 1995.  
 

COA Circular No. 95-011 dated December 4, 1995 states that: 

 

Xxx, public funds shall not be utilized for payment of then services 

of a private legal counsel or law firm to represent government agencies 

in court or to render legal services for them.  In the event that such legal 

services cannot be avoided or is justified under extraordinary or 

exceptional circumstances, the written authority and acquiescence from 

OSG or the Government Corporate Counsel, as the case may be, and the 

written concurrence from COA shall first be secured before the hiring or 

employment of a private lawyer or law firm. 

 

While COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 defines “Irregular 

expenditure” as expenditure incurred without adhering   to established rules, 

regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have gained 

recognition in laws. Irregular expenditures are incurred if funds are disbursed without 

conforming with prescribed usages and rules of discipline.  

 

On February 1, 2020, BCS hired a Legal Consultant for the Office of the 

Director at the rate of P50,000.00 per month covering the period from February 1, 

2020 to May 1, 2020.  Thereafter, her contract of service was renewed every three 

months, the latest was for the period January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021.  

 

As stipulated in the COS, the Legal Consultant shall perform the following 

duties and responsibilities: 

 

1. Legal consultant for PhilSys directly reporting to the Office of the 
Director;  

2. All signing documents must be checked by Legal consultant before the 
Director signs; 

3. Assist in creating administrative policies for the BCS as approved by the 
Director; 

4. Assist in preparation and monitoring of PhilSys, BCS-BAC and 
accounting matters and documentation; 

5. All legal matters will be discussed with the legal consultant; and 
6. Perform other functions as maybe assigned from time to time. 

 



31 

 

In the audit of payment for the services of the Legal Consultant for the period 

February 1 to December 31, 2020 amounting to P550,000.00, it was noted that the 

covering DVs were not supported with the required written conformity and 

acquiescence from the OSG, and written concurrence from COA.  

 

 Inquiry from the OIC, Head of the Finance and Administration (FAD) 

disclosed that the BCS did not obtain the said requirements before it engaged the 

services of the Legal consultant contrary to COA Circular No. 95-011.   

 

In the absence of OSG‟s written authority and acquiescence and COA‟s written 

concurrence, payments for the services of Atty. Nagui were considered irregular 

expenditures as contemplated in COA Circular No. 2012-003.   

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. hold the concerned agency officials who signed/approved the contracts, 
approved the payments, and certified as to the necessity and lawfulness 

of the expenses and completeness of supporting documents liable for 

the refund of salaries of the Legal Consultant in view of the lack of 

written authority from OSG and acquiescence, and concurrence of 

COA; and 

 

b. henceforth, ensure compliance with the provisions of COA Circular 

before engaging the services of a private lawyer.  
 

Management Comment: 

 

Management commented that the main intention of hiring the private lawyer 

was not to do legal matters but to assist the new Director in running the BCS 

particularly in the implementation of PhilSys project.   

 

While the new Management has passionate vision to further improve the 

administrative performances and quality services of the organization in achieving its 

goals and mandate, circumstances created a sense of urgency to hire an experienced 

administrative consultant for the guidance of the agency.  The BCS has already 

accepted the Philsys project which was decided by the previous Management. At the 

same time, BCS was faced with a crisis of a sudden dismissal of its two top 

Management heads and a budget officer whose positions play a vital role in the 

organization which resulted in a vacuum that required immediate solutions so as not 

to impede the operations of the agency.  

 

The service of the private lawyer is more of a consultant on the administrative 

and technical working aspect to ensure that deliverables of BCS for the PhilSys 

project are being met, and Management call her Attorney out of respect. Her acquired 

legal knowledge is an added factor in creating policies and ensuring that processes of 

the organization are above board and within the bounds of law so that BCS will not 



32 

 

create the same mistakes from the past as to what happened to the top Management 

officials that made the situation of the entire organization deeply wounded.  All of 

these were done in good faith.  

 

Moving forward, Management commits that the titles of the service contracts 

will be carefully guided by the observation and will serve as lessons learned. Thus, 

Management respectfully and humbly appeal for kind reconsideration to forego the 

recommendation on holding the concerned officials liable for the payments of the 

consultant.  

 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

 The Audit Team will review the accomplishment reports to be submitted by 

Management to validate the alleged services rendered by the private lawyer.  

However, Management should state the actual duties and responsibilities of the 

individuals to be hired in future contracts of services.  

 
 

Incompatible functions  

 

4. The OIC, Head of FAD also performed disbursing functions contrary to the 
principle of sound internal control on the segregation of duties and functions, 

thereby, creating opportunities to conceal errors or irregularities.  

 

Section 124 of PD No. 1445 states that: “It shall be the direct responsibility of 

the agency head to install, implement and monitor a sound system of internal 

control.” 

 

One of the standards of internal control is the segregation of duties and 

functions wherein key duties and functions such as authorization, custody and 

accounting/recording shall be assigned to separate officers and individuals to 

eliminate opportunities to conceal errors and irregularities 

 

 Section 10.1.3, Part IV, Internal Control Standards for the Philippine Public 

Sector (ICSPPS)- Segregation of Duties, provides that: “To reduce the risk of error, 

waste and wrongful acts, no singular individual or teams should control all key stages 

of transactions or events.  Rather duties and responsibilities should be systematically 

assigned to a number of individuals to ensure that effective checks and balance exist.” 
 

Verification of records disclosed that on February 21, 2020, the OIC, Head of 

FAD was authorized to hold cash advance in the amount of P100,000 to defray 

expenses in connection with the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) 

Campaign.  

  

As such, he has the custodial and disbursing responsibilities over the 

government fund which were incompatible with his functions as Head of the FAD 



33 

 

since he has supervision and influence over some stages of transactions like approval 

of Disbursement Vouchers, Journal Entry Vouchers, and is also a signatory to the 

financial reports/statements.   

 

Allowing one person to perform conflicting duties creates opportunities for 

concealment of errors or irregularities and manipulation of records.  

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. immediately designate another agency officer/personnel to handle the 
cash advance ensuring that no incompatible functions are performed 

in order to provide effective check and balance, and to prevent one 

person to conceal errors and/or irregularities; and   

 

b. direct the OIC, Head of FAD to liquidate the cash advance and to 
refund any remaining balance of his accountability, without delay, to 

the Cashier.   
 

 

Incomplete documentation 

 

5. One hundred nineteen (119) paid Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) involving the 
total amount of P1,479,962.74 were not supported with adequate documentary 

requirements prescribed under COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, 

hence, the validity, propriety and regularity of the transactions were not 

ascertained.  

       

Section 4 of PD No.1445 states that “claims against government funds shall be 

supported with complete documentation and all laws and regulations applicable to 

financial transactions shall be faithfully adhered to.” 

 

While COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribes the revised 

guidelines and documentary requirements for common government transactions.  It 

provides specific documentary requirements for payment of each type of transactions. 

 

Result of post audit revealed that 119 DVs involving the total amount of 

P1,479,962.74 were not supported with adequate documentary requirements. Of the 

said number of DVs, 118 were for the payments of salaries of Contract of Service 

(COS)/Job Order (JO) personnel hired by the agency for the PhilSys Information 

Campaign totaling P1,475,566.74. However, said payments were not supported with 

either copy of contract, Daily Time Record (DTR), and accomplishment report. On 

the other hand, no supporting document was attached to the other DV covering the 

reimbursement of the cost of materials and meals in the amount of P4,396.00.  

 

Due to lack of documents/incomplete documentation, the validity, propriety and 

regularity of the transactions were not established.    

 

 



34 

 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to:  

 

b. require the concerned payees and/or responsible personnel or office to 
immediately submit the lacking documentary requirements to the 

Audit Team to effect proper review of the transactions; and  

 

c. henceforth, instruct the Accountant to ensure that the DVs are 
supported with applicable documentary requirements for each type of 

transaction as prescribed under COA Circular no 2012-001, and 

refrain from processing claims with incomplete documentation.
