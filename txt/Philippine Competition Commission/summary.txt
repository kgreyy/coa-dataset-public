EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

A. Introduction

The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) was created under Republic
Act (RA) No. 10667 or the Philippine Competition Act and was formally organized
on February 1, 2016. It is an independent quasi-judicial body with the original and
primary jurisdiction over the enforcement and implementation of provisions of the
law and its implementing rules and regulations. It has the authority to conduct
inquiries, to investigate and determine cases involving breaches of competition law,
and act against anti-competitive agreements, abuses of dominant position, and anti-
competitive mergers and acquisitions, such as through imposition of sanctions, fines,
and penalties; issuance of injunction orders; requirement of divestment; or
disgorgement of excess profits, among others.

As a regulatory body, the PCC will help protect markets in the Philippines
from anti-competitive behavior, thereby protecting consumers from having their
choices unfairly limited by companies that seek to severely limit these choices in
order to increase profits. Its vision is to be a world-class authority in promoting fair
market competition to help achieve a vibrant and inclusive economy and advance
consumer welfare.

The PCC is composed of a Chairperson and four Commissioners, who shall
have the rank equivalent of cabinet secretary and undersecretary, respectively. The
term of office of the Chairperson and the Commissioners shall be seven years
without reappointment.

The PCC is headed by Dr. Arsenio Balisacan, Chairman, currently assisted
by four Commissioners. The PCC has formed offices through which it will carry
out its mandate, namely, Administrative and Legal, Communication and
Knowledge Management, Competition Enforcement, Economics, Financial,
Planning and Management and Mergers and Acquisitions. PCC holds office at 25/F
Vertis North Corporate Center, North Avenue, Quezon City.

As of December 31, 2020, it had a total manpower of 250 composed of 5
fixed-term, 27 co-terminus, 162 plantilla positions, 19 individual and 37
institutionalized job-order personnel.

D. Scope of Audit

The audit covered the accounts and operations of the PCC for CY 2020. It
was conducted to: (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the
Management’s assertion on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of
transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and
regulations; and (c) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit

International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs).

E. Auditor’s Report of the Financial Statements

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of
the financial statements as at December 31, 2020 due to non-submission of
Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) for the months of October to December 2020
totaling P83,787,886.04.

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations

The following are the significant audit observations and corresponding
recommendations:

1. Two unserviceable laptops with total carrying amount of ₱46,549.91 reported
in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP)
were not dropped from the ICT Equipment account, contrary to Section 40,
Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM, affecting the fairness of presentation of
ICT Equipment in the financial statements. (Paragraph no. 1)

We recommended that Management instruct the:

a) Accountant to draw a Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to recognize the
impairment loss of the two (2) unserviceable laptops reported in the
IIRUP; and

b) Property Officer to submit the IIRUP to the agency’s Disposal
Committee for the immediate disposal of the unserviceable equipment.

2. Disbursement vouchers for the months of October to December 2020
amounting to ₱83,787,886.04 were not submitted for audit, thus the Audit
Team was not able to establish the correctness and reliability of the affected
accounts’ balances in the financial statements as at year end. (Paragraph no.
2)

We recommended that Management direct the Chief Accountant and other
concerned officers and employees to strictly comply with the prescribed
deadlines in the submission of financial reports and documents to the Office of
the Auditor.

The above findings and recommendations were discussed with Management
officials concerned in an exit conference held on March 17, 2021. Management
views and comments were considered in the report, where appropriate. The details
