PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

A. Financial and Compliance Audit

Unserviceable equipment still included in the ICT Equipment balance

1. Two unserviceable laptops with total carrying amount of ₱46,549.91 reported
in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP)
were not dropped from the ICT Equipment account, contrary to Section 40,
Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM, affecting the fairness of presentation of
ICT Equipment in the financial statements.

Section 40, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM states:

c) PPE is said to be unserviceable if it is no longer capable of
providing the entity with future economic benefits or service
potential.

d) All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and
Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix
74). PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by
debiting Impairment Loss – Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of
the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation).

The submitted Report of Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment
(RPCPPE) and IIRUP showed two (2) unserviceable laptops with the following
details:

Total 171,184.00 124,634.09 46,549.91

Verification of the PPE accounts revealed that these two unserviceable laptops are
still carried in the books of the agency as the Accountant has not drawn yet a
Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to recognize impairment loss on the unserviceable
PPEs reported in the IIRUP, required under Section 40 (d), Chapter 10, Volume I of
the GAM; thus, affecting the fair presentation of ICT Equipment in the financial
statements.



38

We recommended that Management instruct the:

a) Accountant to draw a JEV to recognize the impairment loss of the two (2)
unserviceable laptops reported in the IIRUP; and

b) Property Officer to submit the IIRUP to the agency’s Disposal Committee
for the immediate disposal of the unserviceable equipment.

Management Comment:

The Property Officer is currently updating the IIRUP. Corresponding
adjustments/reclassification will be immediately reflected in the books of accounts,
and upon disposal of the laptops.

Delayed Submission of Disbursement Vouchers

2. Disbursement vouchers for the months of October to December 2020
amounting to ₱83,787,886.04 were not submitted for audit, thus the Audit
Team was not able to establish the correctness and reliability of the affected
accounts’ balances in the financial statements as at year end.

Paragraph 6.05 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 provides that “the
official involved in the daily recording of transactions in the books of accounts shall
turn over the receipts and the disbursement records with all paid vouchers and
documents evidencing the transactions to the Auditor within 10 days from date of
receipt of said documents.”

While Section 60 (c), Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM, states that all NGAs shall
prepare and submit the following financial statements/trial balances (FS/TB) and
supporting schedules (SS)/documents within the prescribed deadline.

Entity/Office Statement/Report Deadline Submit to

Monthly TBs and SSs Ten days after the endof the month

In the preparation of the TB, the source/summarizing documents are posted to the
respective SLs. The source documents include the DV, JEV and other supporting
documents.



39

Review on the submission of the required reports and documents submitted to the
Audit Team showed that the DVs were not regularly and timely submitted by the
Accounting Office. As of February 18, 2021, financial reports and documents
covering the period January to September 2020 were delayed.

In consideration of the unexpected challenges and limitations in the overall
operations of agencies brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected
the personnel working arrangement and the submission of financial reports to the
Audit Team, we made an adjustment in the deadline of submission of reports; thus,
the number of days delayed was significantly reduced by two months. Still, the new
computed delay is 10 to 109 working days.

As of February 18, 2021, DVs for the months of October to December 2020
totaling P83,787,886.04 were not yet submitted for audit. Details of the delay are
shown below.

The non-submission to the Auditor’s Office of the aforementioned financial reports
prevented the Audit Team to establish the correctness and reliability of the affected
accounts’ balances in the financial statements as at year end.



40

We recommended that Management direct the Chief Accountant and other
concerned officers and employees to strictly comply with the prescribed
deadlines in the submission of financial reports and documents to the Office of
the Auditor.

Management Comment:

The PCC acknowledged the delay in the submission of DVs/JEVs and supporting
documents and the value of its timely submission to the Office of the Commission
on Audit (COA) for the efficient conduct of the examination and review of the
accounts and operations of the PCC. However, the pandemic brought so many
challenges and limitations in the overall operations of PCC, which significantly
affected the financial processes and submission compliance. The adoption of the
alternative work arrangements such as Work-From-Home (WFH) and Skeletal
Work Force (SWF) in conformity with Inter-Agency Task Force for COVID-19 and
relevant Civil Service Commission rules and regulations affected the efficiency of
government operations compared to the normal times. Nonetheless, PCC continued
to proactively observe business continuity through electronical means, but despite
the precautions observed by PCC, several personnel, including 2 personnel from
accounting tested positive for COVID-19; thus, suspended the physical operations
of PCC for the time being until swab tests of all direct contacts were released.
Further, the sudden transfer of one of the Accountants to other agency and the filing
of sick of leave of the other Accountant significantly reduced the manpower and
operating capacity of the Accounting office. Notwithstanding these circumstances,
PCC assured the Audit Team that they will exert all efforts to improve the system,
to be able to comply on the timely submission of financial reports and documents.

Gender and Development Plan (GAD) and Implementation

3. The PCC had formulated a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues for
FY 2020 through integration in the Agency’s regular activities.

Section 31 of the General Provision (GP) of RA No. 11465 or the General
Appropriation Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year 2020 provides the Programs and Projects
related to GAD. All agencies of the government shall formulate GAD Plan
designed to address gender issues, insofar as it relates to their intended functions,
and integrate the same in their regular activities.

The PCC allotted a budget of P138,780,872.00 for GAD and incurred a total
expense of P55,830,393.26 or 32.55 percent and 13.09 percent, respectively, of the
agency’s total appropriations of P426,330,224.00.

The PCC reported accomplishments relative to the implementation of its plans and
programs related to GAD as presented in the next page.
