C. Scope and Objectives of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial accounts and operations of NTRC for CY 2020.  The 

audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on 

management’s assertion on the Financial Statements (FSs); (b) determine the agency’s 

compliance with laws, rules, and regulations; (c)  recommend agency’s improvement 

opportunities: and, (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit 

recommendations.  

 

 

D. Audit Methodology 
 

We adopted a risk-based approach in the audit of the FSs of the NTRC and in the review 

of compliance with laws, rules, and regulations.  The Audit Team which carried out the 

audit, among others: (i) examined financial and accounting procedures adopted by the 

NTRC and other relevant documentation; (ii) assessed internal controls regulating 

financial operations; (iii) conducted substantive testing of a representative sample of 

selected transactions;  (iv) carried out review, on test check basis, of a number of 

contracts and transactions related to movements in balances of assets, liabilities, 

revenues, and expenses; and, (v) conducted interviews and held discussions with the 

concerned officials and staff  in the agency. 

 

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and the 

concerned officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda. 

 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the NTRC’s 

FSs as at December 31, 2020 due to  the material accounting errors that affected the 

balances of the Inventories, Property, Plant and Equipment and other related accounts, 

as discussed in Part I - Independent Auditor’s Report and in Part II - Observations 

and Recommendations of this report.  

  

 

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

Among the audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in Part 

II of this report, the significant observations are summarized as follows: 

 

1. Various accounting errors due to the inclusion of semi-expendable items already 
issued to end-users in the balances of various Semi-Expendable Inventory accounts, 

and of tangible items below capitalization threshold for Property, Plant and 

Equipment resulted in the misstatements of the related accounts. 

 



  

iii 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief, Accounting 

Division to analyze the transactions and make the necessary adjustments to 

correct the aforementioned errors, and henceforth, observe the proper 

recognition of transactions and classification of accounts in accordance with 

the Government Accounting Manual and other existing accounting rules and 

regulations. 
 

2. Non-preparation and submission of the Requisition and Issue Slip (RISs) and 

Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMIs) for issued inventory item/s under 

various Semi-Expendable Machinery and Equipment accounts had not provided the 

bases to report issuances of the inventory item/s and for the recognition of the 

related expenses in the books.  

 

 We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief, 

Administrative Division to: (a) require the end-user to accomplish the RIS and 

the Administrative Division to indicate therein the issuances of inventory 

item/s requisitioned; (b) prepare the RSMI based on the RISs, and forward 

the same to the Accounting Division as basis for the preparation of the Journal 

Entry Voucher to recognize inventory item/s already issued to end-users. 

 

The aforementioned observations and the corresponding recommendations were 

communicated to concerned agency officials thru the issuance of the CY 2020 

Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations.  Management’s comments 

were received on March 17, 2021, and incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

 

 

G. Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 
 

There were no Notices of Suspension (NSs), Disallowances (NDs) and Charges (NCs) 

issued in CY 2020. The disallowance of P106,750.00 at the beginning of the year was 

fully settled on December 6, 2019 by the persons liable who are still active NTRC 

personnel, and remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury.  NSSDC No. 2020-01 dated June 

3, 2020 for P106,750.00 was subsequently issued and received by NTRC on June 4, 

2020.
