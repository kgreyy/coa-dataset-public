OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

Financial Audit 
 

Accounting Errors 

 

1. Various accounting errors due to the inclusion of semi-expendable items already 
issued to end-users in the balances of various Semi-Expendable Inventory 

accounts, and of tangible items below capitalization threshold for Property, Plant 

and Equipment resulted in the misstatements of the related accounts.  

 

 Section 15, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of the Government Accounting Manual 

(GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) requires that the financial 

statements (FSs) present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash 

flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects 

of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 

recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in the 

Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards (PPSASs), renamed as International 

Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs) pursuant to COA Resolution No. 2020-

001 dated January 9,2020. 

 

Review and verification of the accounts and transactions of the National Tax 

Research Center (NTRC) disclosed accounting deficiencies which affected the 

accuracy of the balances of some of the accounts presented in the FSs at year-end, as 

summarized in Table 1.

According to Management, the books were either purchased or donated to the 

agency prior to CY 2020, issued to the librarian and placed in the library for general 

reference upon delivery.  Also, examination of the General Ledger for Books revealed 

that there were no acquisitions or disposals of books in CY 2020. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief, 

Accounting Division to analyze the transactions and make the necessary 

adjustments to correct the aforementioned errors, and henceforth, observe the 

proper recognition of transactions and classification of accounts in accordance 

with the GAM and other existing accounting rules and regulations.  

 

 

Compliance Issue 

 

2. Non-preparation and submission of the RISs and RSMIs for issued inventory 
item/s under various Semi-Expendable Machinery and Equipment accounts had 

not provided the bases to report issuances of the inventory item/s and for the 

recognition of the related expenses in the books. 

  

Section 17 (d), Chapter 8, Volume 1 of the GAM  provides that the Requisition 

and Issue Slip (RIS) shall be used by the end-user to request issue of supplies and 

materials that are carried on stock. It is also used by the Property and/or Supply 

Division/Unit to record issues of item/s requisitioned, among others.   

 

Section 17(g) of the same Chapter requires that the Report of Supplies and 

Materials Issued (RSMI)  be prepared by the Property and/or Supply Custodian based 

on the RIS and be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the 

Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to record the supplies and materials issued. 

 

As of December 31, 2020, the Semi-Expendable Machinery and Equipment 

accounts had a total balance of P329,681.30. The breakdown is presented in Table 2.

Accounts Amount

Semi-Expendable Information and Communications Technology Equipment  264,877.00  

Semi-Expendable Other Equipment     47,924.30  

Total   P329,681.30  

 



 

27 
 

While the said accounts had book balances as at year-end, examination of the 

Report on Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) revealed that there were no semi-

expendable items on hand reported as at year-end. Verification of the stock cards 

showed that as of December 31, 2020, all semi-expendable items were already issued 

to end-users. 

 

Inquiry with the Chief, Administrative Division and concurrent Property 

Officer disclosed that the semi-expendable items were directly issued to the end-users 

upon delivery, thus, semi-expendable office equipment, ICT equipment and other 

equipment recognized in the books totaling P329,681.30 as of December 31, 2020 were 

no longer on hand or in the possession of the Property Division. However, the RISs and 

RSMIs were not prepared for all requests/issuances of semi-expendable inventories 

since it was understood that Inventory Custodian Slip is what should only be prepared, 

hence, no RISs and RSMIs were submitted to the Accounting Division. 

 

As a result of the non-preparation and submission of the RISs and RSMIs, 

issuances of inventories were not reported by the Administrative Division to the 

Accounting Division and the latter had no bases for recognizing the related expenses 

in the books for the issuances of semi-expendable inventories to end-users. 

 

       We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief, 

Administrative Division to:  (a) require the end-user to accomplish the RIS and 

the Administrative Division to indicate therein the issuances of inventory item/s 

requisitioned; (b) prepare the RSMI based on the RISs, and forward the same to 

the Accounting Division as basis for the preparation of the JEV to recognize  

inventory item/s already issued to end-users. 

 

 

Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts/Areas 

 

3. COVID-19 Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 
 

For CY 2020, the NTRC had not received funds specifically for Coronavirus 

Disease 2019 (COVID-19) response and/or recovery but had utilized its budget for 

related expenses.  As shown in Table 3, the agency spent a total amount of P544,344.11 

for COVID-19 response.

Office supplies and fuel to support its employees as per 

DOH AO No. 2020-0015 and CSC MC No. 18, s. 2020 

Total P544,344.11  

 

Presidential Proclamation No. 922, s. 2020 was issued declaring a State of 

Public Health Emergency throughout the Philippines due to the Corona Virus Disease 

2019 (COVID-19) and the Code Alert System for COVID-19 was raised to Code Red 



 

28 
 

Sub-level Two (2) in accordance with the recommendation of Department of Health 
(DOH) and Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious 

Disease. The same Presidential Proclamation likewise declared a State of Calamity 

throughout the Philippines and imposed an Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) 

throughout Luzon. 

 

In line with this, the Office of the President, DOH and Civil Service (CSC) 

issued guidelines in support for all government employees during this time of 

pandemic. 

 

On the sector-specific plans and guidelines, and provision of supplies/materials for 

hazard control 

 

Paragraph B, Section VI of AO No. 2020-0015 dated April 27, 2020 of the 

DOH on Risk-based Public Health Standards Across Settings provides that at the 

minimum, all actors shall implement the prescribed interventions in various settings 

depending on their Risk Severity Grading. For each prescribed intervention, concrete 

examples of corresponding hazard controls (e.g. engineering control, administrative 

control, and PPEs) are provided. NGAs shall build on the identified interventions in 

developing sector-specific policies and plans, and may propose adjustments for 

additional interventions inconsistent with those indicated in this Order. 

 

Section VII of the same AO states that NGAs shall develop and submit their 

sector-specific plans and guidelines on the operationalization of the risk-based public 

health standards to the DOH, which shall be consolidated and endorsed by the 

Secretary of Health to the IATF. 

 

The NTRC did not develop nor submit its sector-specific plans and guidelines 

to the Department of Finance (DOF) in compliance with Paragraph B, Section VI of 

AO No. 2020-0015 dated April 27, 2020. However, NTRC issued Office Circulars 

prescribing guidelines for the prevention of COVID-19 to ensure safety of all its 

employees and stakeholders. 

 

Moreover, as a response to the ongoing pandemic, the NTRC procured 

thermoguns, alcohols and facemasks totaling P99,720.00 to be used by its employees. 

Facemasks were distributed only to those who goes to work while thermoguns and 

alcohols were placed in the entrance of the office for general use. Disbursement 

Vouchers (DVs) and supporting documents on these procurements were verified and 

were found to be properly and completely documented. 

 

        On the provision of transportation facilities to employees on skeleton workforce  

 

Item d, Section 4.0 of CSC Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 18, s, 2020 states 

that reasonable transportation facilities and housing quarters shall be provided to 

employees assigned as skeleton workforce, whenever practicable, and subject to 

budgeting, accounting and auditing rules and regulations. 



 

29 
 

 

NTRC provided staff cars for those employees who will be reporting to office, 

both in  the DOF and the Palacio del Gobernador during the ECQ/Modified ECQ 

(MECQ) where public transportation was limited or not yet available. During 

ECQ/MECQ, a total amount of P113,124.11 was spent for fuel, oil and lubricants. 

DVs and supporting documents on these expenses were verified and were found to 

be properly and completely documented. 

 

On the grant of hazard pay to employees during the ECQ/MECQ 

 

Section 1 of AO No. 26 dated March 24, 2020 authorized the NGAs to grant 

COVID-19 Hazard Pay to personnel who physically reported for work during the 

implementation of ECQ in their respective work stations, in an amount not exceeding 

P500.00 per day per person. 

 

Section 2 of the same AO states that the conditions on the grant of the COVID-

19 Hazard Pay; that the heads of government agencies may grant the COVID-19 

Hazard Pay to their personnel/workers without the need for further approval by the 

Department of Budget and Management (DBM), subject to the following guidelines 

and conditions:  

 

1. The personnel are occupying regular, contractual or casual 
positions, or are workers engaged through COS, JO, or other similar 

schemes. 

  

2. The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for 
work at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed 

official working hours by the head of agency/office during the 

period of implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine 

measures in the area of such office or work station. 

 

3. The total rate of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay shall be based on the 
number of days an employee/worker physically reports for work 

during the Enhanced Community Quarantine period using the 

formula under Section 1 hereof. 

 

Review of the Hazard Pay expenses for CY 2020 disclosed that the NTRC 

granted hazard pay at P500/day totaling P331,500.00 to NTRC officials and 

employees who reported to office during the ECQ (March 17 to May 15) and MECQ 

(May 16 to 31; August 4 to 18).  

 

Verification of the relevant DVs on the grant of hazard pay showed that the 

payments were supported with Office Circular declaring skeletal workforce during 

ECQ and MECQ, payroll and  Daily Time Record of the NTRC employees who were 

authorized to report. 

 



 

30 
 

The Office Circular provided the alternative workforce arrangements such as 

home and creation of skeletal workforce. The number of days and key personnel who 

will work on rush assignments, attend meetings and other activities which will require 

their presence will be determined by the respective supervisors of each branch of the 

NTRC. The schedule is submitted to the Human Resource Division physically or 

electronically and is updated on a weekly basis. 

 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

4. Out of the seven activities in the GPB, five were implemented while two were not 
implemented, thus, affected the achievement of the corresponding GAD 

objectives for the related gender issues. 

 

All agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to 

address gender issues within their mandate.  The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the 

regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five per cent of their budgets. 

 

The Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) endorsed the NTRC’s GAD 

Plan and Budget (GPB) for CY 2020 of P3,010,000.00 or 4.85 per cent of its 

P62,000,000.00 appropriations.  

 

Evaluation of the GBP and GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) for CY 2020 

showed the following: 

 

a) The PCW-endorsed GPB of P3,010,000.00 does not tally with the budget 
indicated in the GAD AR of P2,717,595.00.  The said reported budget in 

the AR of P2,717,595.00 was also the reported actual cost/expenditure for 

GAD;  

 

b) There were two other planned activities in the GPB that were not 
accomplished, however, the same were not presented in the GAD AR as 

unaccomplished activities. 
 

c) Five out of the seven planned activities were implemented while two 
activities were not implemented, the details of these planned activities with 

the budget and the corresponding expenses for those implemented are 

shown in Table 4:

furniture.

7. Set up a GAD database management system which 
will serve as repository of all relevant sex 

disaggregated data (SDD) that are being encoded, 

processed, generated and analyzed. 

200,000.00 0.00        200,000.00  

Total P3,010,000.00  P2,717,595.00  P  292,405.00  

 

As can be gleaned from the above table, there were two activities where the 

actual expenses exceeded the budget set in the GPB. According to Management,   the 

budget for the activities based on the attribution of the related cost for the number of 

participants to the activities had been underestimated.  Moreover, tax implications 

were originally planned to be only as studies, however, the same were published in the 

NTRC Tax Research Journal thereby increasing the actual expenses. 

 

Management informed that the set up of GAD data management is in the 

process of planning and building of contents, while the renovation of the lactation 

station is still for discussion with other top management on which floor it will be built 

due to ongoing renovation of the 2nd floor in which some of the NTRC employees will 

be stationed. 

 

Thus, the GAD objectives relative to the renovation of the lactation station and 

setting up of a GAD database management system which are to enhance maternal 

requirements of women employees and to institutionalize the use of SDD in the 

NTRC’s programs, projects and activities, respectively, were not achieved. 

 



 

32 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chairperson, 

GAD Focal Point System to: 

 

a) Use the budget in the GPB endorsed by PCW as well as the planned 
activities vis-a-vis the accomplishments in the preparation of the GAD AR 

to present the actual variance between the GAD budget and the actual 

expenses for each activity and  which GAD activities had been 

accomplished or not; and 

 

b) Plan carefully the agency’s GAD activities so that the actual cost do not 
exceed the budgeted amount, and determine and include in the GPB those 

which can be implemented in a given year, to provide a basis for the 

related budget. 

 

 

5. Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWD) 
 

In compliance with Section 32 of the General Appropriations Act  for FY 2020, 

the NTRC has conducted the following seminars related to activities benefitting SCs 

and PWDs: (a) Webinar on Gender and Mental Health; (b) Webinar on Mental Health 

Measures for Elderly During Pandemic; and (c) Webinar on Violence Against Women 

and Children, at a total attributed cost of  P337,620.00 and actual cost of P15,916.00 

for the honoraria of resource persons.  
 

 

6. Tax Laws and Regulations, GSIS and Pag-IBIG Premium Contributions and  
Loan Amortizations, and PhilHealth Premium Contributions 

 

The NTRC had complied with the withholding and remittances of taxes  

pursuant to the rules and regulations issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).  

However, remittances of premium contributions and loan amortizations  to the 

Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) and the Philippine Health Insurance 

Corporation (PhilHealth) for March to May 2020 and March to December 2020, 

respectively, were not remitted within the 10th day of the ensuing month when 

deductions were made. Delays in the remittance of mandatory deductions and loan 

amortizations to the Pag-IBIG were likewise noted for April and December 2020. The 

details are presented in Table 5.

Due to GSIS pertains to Retirement and Life Insurance Premiums on salary 

adjustments for December 2020 that were for remittance to the GSIS.  Due to Pag-

IBIG represents Pag-IBIG loan premium on the last salary paid to an outgoing 

employee for the month of December 2020 while Due to PhilHealth consists of 

PHIC premium contributions (both personal and government share) of the NTRC 

officials and employees for the month of December 2020.  

 

 

7. GSIS Property Insurance Law 
 

Management has complied with the Property Insurance Law by insuring all 

its insurable properties, with carrying amount of P6,873,057.22 as of December 31, 

2020, at a total premium of P88,881.90. 

 

 

8. Hiring of Casual, Job Orders, Contractual, and Consultant 

 
The NTRC did not hire any casual, job order or contractual employees, and 

consultants in CY 2020. 

   

 

9. Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges 
 

The balances of the Notices of Suspensions (NSs), Disallowances (NDs), and 

Charges (NCs) as at year-end are summarized in Table 6.
