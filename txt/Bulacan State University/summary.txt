		C.	 Scope of Audit



	The audit covered the accounts and operations of the BulSU for CY 2020.  It was conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the Management’s assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as extent of compliance on applicable laws, rules and regulations; c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; d) determine the extent of implications of prior year’s audit recommendations.  Moreover, the audit was conducted in accordance with International Standard of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). The thrust areas identified in the audit instructions were audited on a sampling basis and the findings are incorporated in Part II of this report, as follows:



1. Financial Audit



	a)	Cash

	b)	Cash Advances

	c)	Intra-Fund Transfers to and from Other funds

	d)	Property, Plant and Equipment

	e)	Liabilities

	f)	Infrastructure Projects

	g)	Expenses



2. Compliance Audit 



				a)	Internal Control on Cash Management

				b)	Compliance with BIR Rules and Regulations

				c)	Compliance with R.A. No. 8291 (GSIS)

				d)	Compliance with R.A. No. 9679 (Pag-IBIG Fund Law)

				e)	Gender and Development (GAD) 

				f)	University Assessment of Performance in Licensure Examinations

A)				 Independent Auditor’s Report 

		

	The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of different accounts in the financial statements because of the following accounting errors and omissions such as (a) understatement by ₱262,042,961.36 of the Cash in Bank, Local Currency Current Account (LCCA) due to unrecorded/unadjusted valid reconciling items in the Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS);  and (b) doubtful existence, reliability and accuracy of the  year-end balances of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts due to (i) unreconciled differences of ₱328,618,460.82 between the accounting and property records; (b) incomplete physical inventory-taking of PPEs; (c) non-recognition of various donated properties for failure to determine the proper valuation; and (d) unaccounted/missing PPEs in the amount of ₱8,152,265.08. 

		

			In view of the foregoing, we recommended and management agreed to undertake the following courses of action:

		

--			On Cash in Bank, Local Currency Current Account (LCCA)

		

							a)			Instruct the Accountant to (i) draw the appropriate journal entry vouchers (JEVs) to recognize all reconciling items requiring adjustment in the books of the University; (ii) prepare the BRS on a monthly basis to properly identify the source and nature of errors/adjustments; and (iii) furnish the AGDBs with copies of the BRS to inform them of the required adjustments/supporting documents on their part,  thus, ensuring the accuracy of both the bank’s and the University’s records on the Cash in Bank accounts. 

		

--			On Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts

		

							b)			Instruct the Accountant and Supply Unit to facilitate the reconciliation of their records and adjust the books of accounts and property records, as warranted, once the results have been established; 

		

							c)			Investigate the cause and determine the whereabouts of the missing PPEs from the accountable officers (AOs). Otherwise, instruct the Accountant to set up a receivable to establish the accountability of the AOs who failed to present the missing PPEs; 



							d)			Determine the fair market value of the unrecorded donated PPEs and provide depreciation to present the PPE at its proper valuation; and

		

							e)			Undertake proper planning and designate additional members of the Committee on Inventory to facilitate the completion of the physical count of all PPEs owned by the University; and i) follow the instructions provided for accomplishing the Property, Plant, and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) and Property Card (PC) to ensure that the balances of the PPEs presented in the reports submitted by the Accountant and the Supply Unit are both correct; and ii) assign a property number for each PPE issued to the different offices for proper monitoring purposes. 



		

B)			Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations

	

			Summarized below are the other significant audit observations with their recommendations, the details of which are presented in Part II of this report.

		

1)			The reliability of the Land account with a reported balance of ₱29,362,874.12 as of December 31, 2020 was doubtful due to (a) failure to secure the Transfer Certificates of Title (TCTs) of various parcels of land under the name of the University contrary to Section 39 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445; (b) unreconciled difference of ₱5,122,425.33 between the Accounting and Property records; and (c) unrecorded fair market value (FMV) of the donated lot, thus, affecting the fair presentation of the Land account in the financial statements. (Observation No. 2)



We reiterated our previous year’s recommendation and the University President agreed to (a) require the University officials concerned to facilitate the immediate titling of the parcels of land in the name of the University to protect its interest; (b) instruct the University Accountant to cause the immediate recording of the fair market value of the donated lands; and (c) instruct the University Accountant and the Supply Officer to reconcile their records on the cost of  each parcel of  land to arrive at the correct Land account balance to be reflected in the financial statements.



2)			The absence of subsidiary ledgers (SLs) and documents to support the reported balance of Other Payables account in the amount of ₱958,975,401.43 as of December 31, 2020 rendered doubt on its existence, completeness and accuracy contrary to Section 111 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445.  (Observation No. 4)

		

We recommended and management agreed to direct the Accountant to: 	



a)	Exert effort in determining and extracting the details of Other Payables amounting to ₱958,975,401.43 and maintain subsidiary ledgers (SLs) to support the General Ledger (GL) controlling account for Other Payables; and



b)	Identify the remaining balances of externally-funded projects lodged under Other Payables and transfer the same to the Due to NGAs account and/or other appropriate accounts, if warranted.



3. 	Out of the recorded Receivables with a carrying value of ₱357,280,649.82 as at year-end, the accuracy and collectability of some accounts totaling to ₱122,882,652.29   were uncertain due to (a)  absence of effective measures for the collection of long outstanding accounts from students’ unpaid loans and tuition fees totaling to ₱71,564,227.98; (b) discontinuance of sending of bills/statement of accounts to a lessee with outstanding leases of ₱49,780,407.21 as at December 31, 2020; and (c) unreconciled records on student loans under the Student Financial Assistance Program (STUFAP) resulting in a discrepancy of ₱1,538,017.10. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended and management agreed to undertake the following courses of action:



a)	Determine the whereabouts of the alumni of the University who were able to graduate despite their unsettled accountabilities and demand in writing the immediate settlement thereof; 



b)	Determine the amount due from Graceland, Inc. and record in the books; 



c)	Demand payment from Graceland, Inc. for their continuous occupation in the premises of the University; 



d)	Exert effort in collecting payments of arrearages from the delinquent stall lessees; and



e)	Instruct the Accounting Unit and the OSS to reconcile and update their records to come up with more reliable information regarding the SAFE loan program.  

	

	4. 	Various idle, obsolete and unserviceable properties with a total carrying amount of ₱6,717,470.79 as of December 31, 2020 were still carried in the books of accounts due to lack of a disposal program,  resulting in the further deterioration of the assets, thus, depriving the Agency of any benefit or financial gain that may be derived from their monetization and overstating the recorded PPE balances for failure to derecognize items of no economic value to the Agency contrary to Section 79 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No.1445,  National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 425 dated January 28, 1992, and Section 40, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. (Observation No. 6)

	

We recommended and management agreed to undertake the following courses of action:



a)	Conduct periodic inspection and assessment of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and facilitate the immediate disposal of idle and unserviceable PPEs which are of no longer use and/or benefit to the Agency in accordance with NBC No. 425 in as much as their values tend to diminish due to the passage of time and constant exposure to elements; and



b)	Instruct the Accountant to drop from the books of accounts the unserviceable PPEs following the procedures prescribed under Section 40, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.

	

5. 	Despite the impressive performance of the Bulacan State University (BulSU) in majority of the Licensure Examinations, there were programs which manifested declining University Passing Rates (UPRs) for the last five years, specifically in the programs of Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Guidance Counseling, and Secondary Education. The Bustos Campus of the University significantly showed poor performance in the licensure examinations for Secondary Education which raised alarm on the capability of the BulSU in producing professionals in the field of education. Moreover, BulSU failed to obtain a Center of Excellence and/or Center of Development status from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for any of its programs, thus, casting doubt on the performance of the University performance in the areas of instruction, research and publication, extension and linkages and institutional qualifications. (Observation No. 17)

	

We recommended and management agreed to undertake the following courses of action: 



a)	Require the Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA) to revisit the programs with declining UPRs for the last five years; 



b)	Require the Dean of Bustos Campus to conduct an in-depth evaluation of its programs to identify the causes of the poor performance in licensure examinations of its graduates; and



c)	Conduct an evaluation and institute reforms on the programs offered by the University to improve performance in the areas of instruction, research and publication, extension and linkages and institutional qualifications which are the general criteria of CHED for the grant of COE and COD statuses. 





C)		Summary of Total Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges as of year-end 

	

				As of December 31, 2020, the University had unsettled audit disallowances totaling to ₱38,359,030.18. The Notices of Disallowances (NDs) issued in CY 2020 pertained to the Cultural and Athletic Activities Allowance granted to the regular faculty and personnel of BulSU in December 2019 which was disallowed in audit due to irregular payment.  The NDs were appealed by the University, and is now the subject of evaluation by the Office of the Regional Director, COA Regional Office No. III, City of San Fernando, Pampanga.

	

D)		Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations

	

				Of the 63 audit recommendations contained in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report (AAR), 20 were fully implemented, 6 were partially implemented and 37 were not implemented.
