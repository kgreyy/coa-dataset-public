AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

Financial Audit 

 

Accounting Errors/Omissions 

 

1. Various accounting errors/omissions in the keeping of accounts resulted in the 
misstatements of some assets, liabilities, equity and expense accounts in the FSs. 

 

The International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 provides that 

financial statements (FSs) shall present fairly the financial position, financial 

performance, and cash flows of an entity.  Fair presentation requires the faithful 

presentation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance 

with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses 

set out in the IPSASs.  The application of IPSASs, with additional disclosure, when 

necessary, is presumed to result in FSs that achieve a fair presentation. 

 

Sections 111 and 112, Chapter 2, Title III of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, 

require, among others, each government agency to record its financial transactions and 

operations conformably with generally accepted accounting principles and in 

accordance with pertinent laws and regulations. 

 

Review and verification of the accounts and transactions of the Department of 

Finance (DOF) disclosed errors/omissions that resulted in the misstatements of affected 

accounts, as shown in Table 1.

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant to analyze the related transactions and prepare the necessary 

adjusting entries to correct the aforementioned errors; and henceforth, observe 

the proper/correct recognition of accounts and transactions in accordance with 

the GAM for NGAs and other applicable rules and regulations. 

 

 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

2. The existence, completeness and accuracy of the balances of several asset, liability 
and expense accounts were not ascertained due to discrepancies between the 

books and related records/reports, non-compliance with accounting standards 

and other issuances, and dormancy of accounts, among others.  
 

Analysis of the accounts and transactions of the DOF revealed various 

deficiencies that have an impact on the fair presentation of the year-end balances of 

affected accounts, as summarized in Table 2.

In view of cross-cutting issues, the accounting deficiencies also include 
compliance issues as discussed below including the corresponding recommendations. 

 

a. Funds transferred to GOCCs not liquidated within the prescribed period 

 

As at December 31, 2020, the reported balance of Due from Government Owned 

or Controlled Corporations totaled P54.670 million, representing fund transfers to the 

Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP), Philippine Center for Economic 

Development (PCED), Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) and 

Philippine Postal Corporation (PPC) for the implementation of specific projects. 

Although fund transfers are to be liquidated within 10 days after the end of each month 



53 

 

or the end of the agreed period for the project, these fund transfers remained 

unliquidated as at year-end, as presented in Table 3.

Based on the DAP’s reply to our confirmation, the amount of P10.610 million 

was already expended/utilized for consulting services and other expenses incurred from 

November 2019 to December 2020 for the implementation of the COFSRP-Phase II 

project and PCME totaling P8.249 million and P2.361 million, respectively. 

 

The Accounting Division (AD) informed that liquidation reports and 

documents are still under verification by the DAP, thus were not submitted yet to the 

DOF as at December 31, 2020.  

 

The funds transferred to the PCED for the implementation of the DOF- PDMSG 

Careership program in the amount of  P7.500 million was not liquidated as at December 



54 

 

31, 2020, even if the time frame of the implementation of the project from February 

2018 to June 2020 had already lapsed. The PDMSG personnel monitoring the 

implementation of the PCED-Careership program informed that follow up with the 

PCED on the submission of the report of disbursements, among others, had been made 

but no reports have not been submitted yet to the DOF. 

 

For the fund transfer of P14.130 million for the API-MITHI project, the PITC 

had already completed the procurement of API gateway cloud license, which had been 

duly delivered to the DOF and accepted by the DOF end-user. It was informed by the 

AD that the liquidation of the API-MITHI project funds of P14.111 million was 

recognized in the books only on January 4, 2021, while the balance of P18,715.08 was 

refunded by the PITC and recognized in the books on March 5, 2021.  Thus, the fund 

transfer remained outstanding as at December 31, 2020.  

 

On the DESP-ISMS project funded from the CY 2019 General Appropriations 

Act (GAA), the concerned personnel from the Central Information Management Office 

informed, and as confirmed by the AD, the said project did not push through in CY 

2020 due to problems encountered in the signing of the Memorandum of Agreement 

between the DOF and the PITC, thus, the amount of P10.5 million was refunded to the 

DOF on March 16, 2021.  

 

As to the fund transferred to the PPC in the amount of P9,192.00, this represents 

payment for postal stamps which were delivered only on January 15, 2021, thus, the 

fund transfer was also outstanding as at year-end. 

 

The non-submission of the reports of disbursements and supporting documents 

to liquidate the fund transfers within the prescribed period and refunds of fund transfers 

by the concerned GOCCs made beyond CY 2021 caused the non-recognition of the 

expended/utilized amounts of the fund transfers in the books. Thus, the completeness 

and accuracy of the balances of Due from Government Owned or Controlled 

Corporations and the related asset and expense accounts as at year-end were not 

ascertained.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant to: (a) demand the submission of the liquidation reports and related 

supporting documents  for all outstanding fund transfers as at December 31, 2020 

and thereafter on a monthly basis, at year end or after project completion in order 

to recognize in the books expended/utilized amounts or any excess funds  to fairly 

present affected accounts  in the FSs as at  the end of the appropriate reporting 

period; and (b) recognize in the books the related disbursements or any excess 

funds from the fund transfers upon receipt of the liquidation reports. 

 

b. Unreconciled accounting and property records/report for Office Supplies Inventory 
 

Item D, Appendix 57 Instructions on the SLC, Volume II of the GAM for NGAs 

provides that the semestral physical inventory of supplies shall be reconciled with the 



55 

 

SLCs and Property records; while Item E, Appendix 58 Instructions on the SC provides 

that the balance per SC shall be reconciled regularly with the SLCs maintained by the 

AD.  Any discrepancies shall be immediately verified and adjusted. 

 

As at December 31, 2020, the general ledger balance of Office Supplies 

Inventory and the total balance of the SLCs maintained by the AD, both totaled P5.591 

million.  On the other hand, the balances of the SCs maintained by the General Services 

Division (GSD)-Property Section (PS) totaled P3.069 million while the RPCI as at 

December 31, 2020 showed the same total. 

 

Comparison of the balances of SLCs with the SCs and the RPCI for the 

inventory items disclosed a net discrepancy of P2.522 million, with details shown in 

Table 4.

Review and analysis of the accounting and property records disclosed that the 

net discrepancy of P2.522 million was due to the following: 

 

i. Unaccounted net discrepancy between the SLCs, and SCs and RPCI balances - 

P1.677 million 

 

Analysis and verification of inventory transactions recognized in the SLCs 

compared to that of the transactions posted in the SCs showed unreconciled balances 

with a net difference of P1.677 million, as presented in Table 5.

Difference  P 3,999,524.23  P 2,322,459.41  P 1,677,064.82  

 

During the actual physical count conducted, the net difference of P1.667 million 

between the SLCs and SCs/RPCI’s balances pertains to inventory items which were 

not physically counted. Verification with the GSD-PS revealed that the SCs were not 

maintained for the inventory balances in the SLCs.  Review of the SLCs disclosed that 

the inventory balances were for prior years’ transactions aged from four to16 years, 

where issuances and disposals may not have been recognized in the books as the 

transactions occurred, hence the difference.  

 

According to the Accounting personnel currently in charge of the recognition 

of inventories, these are inventory items recognized in the books in the past years, but 

corresponding issuances/disposals were not taken up by previous bookkeepers, thus 

balances remained in the books, carried over to the next accounting periods and 

remained dormant as at December 31, 2020.  It was assured, however, by the AD and 

the GSD-PS that available documents will be gathered to support the adjustments to 

the Office Supplies Inventory. 

 

ii. Dormant SLC balances - P864,844.19  
  

Review of the SLCs for Office Supplies Inventory showed two dormant 

balances labeled “Other SL” amounting to P0.819 million and P46,000.00, or a total of 

P0.865 million.  Verification with the AD disclosed that these SLC balances were 

forwarded from prior years and were recognized as items for reconciliation during the 

roll-out of the old e-NGAs in CY 2005. The items recognized in the said SLCs 

remained dormant and were not analyzed and documented for adjustment, as necessary 

and reported in the appropriate inventory records/reports, rendering the reported SLCs’ 

year-end balances unreliable. 

 



57 

 

iii. Unrecognized inventory items in the SLCs - P19,837.05 

  

Examination of the corresponding SLCs of inventory items posted in the SCs 

and counted during the physical count disclosed that the said items were not recognized 

in the SLCs as at December 31, 2020.  According to the AD and the GSD-PS personnel 

concerned, documents on procured and delivered office supplies totaling P19,837.05 

may have been misplaced and had not been submitted to the AD. However, both are 

willing to locate the documents in order to recognize the inventory items in the related 

SLCs. 

 

Due to the noted deficiencies in recognizing inventories in the SLCs and SCs, 

from the time of purchase/acquisition to issuance/disposal, dormant balances and 

unrecognized inventories, resulting in unreconciled balances between the accounting 

and property records, the existence, completeness and accuracy of the balance of Office 

Supplies Inventory at year-end of P5.591 million was not ascertained.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant and the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), GSD to reconcile the 

SLCs, SCs and RPCI’s balances and make the necessary adjustments in their 

respective records after reconciliation. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief 

Accountant to analyze the dormant SLC balances and to exert effort to gather the 

related documents for adjustment in the SLCs as necessary.  
 

We further recommended that Management instruct the CAO, GSD to: (a) 

locate immediately the documents pertaining to inventory items totaling 

P19,837.05 and submit the same to the AD; and (b) henceforth, promptly provide 

the AD with the appropriate documents on the purchase of inventory items for 

the latter to recognize the inventories in the books. 

 

c. Unliquidated balances of Advances to Special Disbursing Officer as at year-end 
 

As at December 31, 2020, Advances to Special Disbursing Officer had a balance 

of P1.607 million.  Verification of the related records with the AD disclosed the 

following cash advance (CA) balances of SDOs at year-end, as presented in Table 6.

of P1.607 million as at December 31, 2020.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned SDOs 

to ensure that all CAs for specific purposes or time-bound undertakings are 

liquidated immediately after the purpose for which the CA had been granted had 

been served, through the submission of liquidation reports and supporting 

documents, and/or refund of the unexpended balances of the CAs. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief 

Accountant to monitor unliquidated CAs through notification or demand letter to 

concerned SDOs to help ensure that CAs are fully liquidated as at year-end.

Deficiencies in the review of dividend remittances 

 

3. Non-submission of the results of the review of the dividend remittances and of the 
requests for dividend reliefs/downward adjustments in dividends, and absence of 

a database on such review had precluded the determination of the accuracy of the 

dividend remittance to the BTr and the validity of/approval on non-/under-

remittances of dividends by the GOCCs.  

 

Pursuant to Section 7 of Republic Act (RA) No. 7656, “An Act Requiring 

Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) to Declare Dividends 

Under Certain Conditions to the National Government, and For Other Purposes”, the 

DOF promulgated the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of RA No. 

7656 approved on November 9, 1993, that GOCCs shall share a substantial amount of 

their net earnings to the National Government (NG).  

 

a. Non-submission of the results of the review of the correctness of dividend 

remittances for the dividend years 2017-2019 
 

Section 7 of the RIRR further provides that: (a) simultaneous with the payment 

of the dividends to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr), the GOCC shall send to the 

Department of Finance (DOF) the: (i) schedule showing the computation of dividends 

due (copy furnished the BTr); (ii) copy of its Annual Income Tax Return, duly received 

by the BIR or authorized agent banks, for the relevant dividend year; (iii) financial 

statements for the relevant dividend year duly received by the BIR or authorized agent 

bank; and (iv) schedules on program subsidies and subsidies granted to settle tax 

obligations for prior year/s treated as revenues, and actual disbursements of program 

subsidies treated as expenses. The schedules should be signed by the GOCC’s chief 

executive officer; and (b) the DOF-Corporate Affairs Group (CAG) shall determine 

and review the correctness of the computation of dividend remittance. 

Section 5 of the RIRR requires that except as otherwise provided therein, all 

GOCCs covered by these rules regardless of shareholdings, shall annually declare 

dividends directly to the NG in the name of the Treasurer of the Philippines (i) on or 

before May 15 of each year, at least fifty per cent (50%) of their Net Earnings, as Cash, 

Stock and/or Property Dividends, and (ii) in the interest of promoting fiscal discipline 

and improving revenue generation efforts, the DOF, upon consultation with the DBM 

and the Governance Commission for GOCCs (GCG), may request the GOCC to remit 

above 50 per cent  minimum dividend rate in the event that the GOCC has excess cash 

or windfall earnings; provided that the viability and purposes for which the GOCC has 

been established are not impaired. 

Section 9 (a) of the RIRR states that xxx. In case of failure of a GOCC to declare 

and remit the proper amount of dividends in accordance with the RIRR to RA 7656 

xxx (ii) The BTr in coordination with DOF, shall assess the GOCC a penalty charge 



60 

 

for late payment equivalent to the prevailing 364-day regular Treasury bill rate plus 

five per cent on the dividend due. 

 

Confirmation with the BTr Accounting Service on dividend remittances by 

GOCCs revealed that 67 GOCCs remitted dividends for CYs 2017-2019 totaling 

P31.212 billion, P40.791 billion and P53.421 billion, respectively, or a total of 

P125.424 billion.  Details are shown in Table 7.

Based on Table 7, a total of 19 GOCCs did not declare and remit dividends to 

the BTr within CYs 2017 to 2019.  

 

In addition, five GOCCs did not also declare and remit dividends to the BTr, as reported in 
the Annual Audit Reports (AARs) of the GOCCs published in the COA website.  Details are 

presented in Table 8.

In order to verify and evaluate the correctness, accuracy and completeness of 

the GOCCs’ remittances of dividends to the BTr, the Audit Team in its letter dated 

January 25, 2021, requested from the Corporate Affairs Group (CAG) the following: 

(a) List of GOCCs’ declared dividends versus dividends as reviewed by CAG; (b) List 

of GOCCs’ declared dividends remitted to BTr; (c) List of GOCCs’ penalties due to 

non-remittance and/or delayed remittance of dividends; and other documents as 

needed. In spite of several follow-ups, however, the CAG did not submit the requested 

documents that will enable the determination of the CAG’s compliance with the 

required review of the correctness of the dividend remittances by the GOCCs. 

 

Moreover, as the BTr only receives the dividend remittances from the GOCCs, 

which are recognized in the books of the BTr-National Government (NG) and for which 

results of the CAG’s review of the correctness of the dividends have not been received, 

it has no information on the correctness of the dividends received to determine any 

shortfall in the dividends.  While the BTr had also observed non-remittances of 

dividends by GOCCs in certain years, it could not recognize dividends receivable from 

the GOCCs without any advice from the DOF on reason/s for non-remittance of 

dividends or if any dividend is due from the GOCCs.  Shortfalls in dividend remittances 

by the GOCCs, if any, could not likewise be determined by the BTr and recognition of 

dividends receivables could not be made if the results of the CAG’s review of the 

correctness of the dividend remittances by the GOCCs to the BTr or how much 

dividend is due from each GOCC is not furnished to the BTr. 

 

Thus, the CAG’s non-submission of the requested documents on dividend 

remittances by the GOCCs did not facilitate the determination of its compliance with 

required review of the correctness of the dividends remitted by the GOCCs to the BTr 

and of the correctness of the dividends received by the NG, and the recognition of 

dividend receivables, if any, in the BTr-NG books. 

 

We recommended that Management require the Director, CAG to: (a) 

make available to the Audit Team the results of the review of the correctness of 

the computation of the dividends declared and remitted by the GOCCs to BTr 

and the related supporting documents to enable the assessment of its compliance 

with the said review; (b) ensure that all GOCCs that are to declare and remit 

dividends  do so every dividend year in order to improve the revenue generation 

of the NG; and (c) determine  the validity of the non-declaration and remittance 

of dividends by the GOCCs to the NG. 

 



63 

 

We also recommend that Management direct the Director, CAG to: (a) 

coordinate with the BTr and request for a report on dividends received to  

determine if dividends determined  to be due to the NG had been received  and 

that any non-remittance of dividends are valid and with the appropriate approval 

of the President of the Philippines or his authorized representative;  and (b) agree 

with the BTr on which office will bill the GOCCs for non-/under-remittances of 

dividends; and (c) provide the BTr with the results of  CAG’s review of the 

dividend remittances to provide the bases for verifying the correctness of 

dividends received and for the setting up of dividend receivables from GOCCs in 

case of shortfalls in remittances. 

 

b. Non-provision of the results of the evaluation of GOCCs’ request for dividend 

relief/downward adjustments in dividends, and related deficiencies 

Section 7, Flexible Clause - (a) In the interest of the national economy and 

general welfare, and in consideration of the viability of the GOCCs and the purposes 

for which they were established, the percentage of the annual Net Earnings that shall 

be declared by the GOCC may be adjusted by the President of the Philippines below 

the minimum 50% Dividend rate, upon recommendation of the Secretary of Finance. 

(b) Subject to Section 7a of these Rules, a downward adjustment in dividend rate below 

the minimum 50% may be allowed in various cases xxx; (c) Request for downward 

adjustment should be submitted to the Secretary of Finance on or before May 15 of the 

year following the relevant dividend year. xxx. 

 

The AARs of the selected GOCCs published in the COA website disclosed that 

various GOCCs had requested from the CAG relief from the declaration and 

remittances of dividends/downward adjustments, with the details shown in Table 9.

In a letter dated March 1, 2021, the Audit Team requested from the CAG, any 

report/s/documents on the results of evaluation of the GOCCs’ requests for dividend 

reliefs and dividend downward adjustments, and also on the various GOCCs’ noted 

deficiencies in the declaration and remittances of dividends to the BTr as reported in 

the published AARs as these may affect the revenue collections of NG. However, no 

documents were provided by the CAG.  

 

According to the CAG Director, although assessments were made on the 

GOCCs’ declaration and remittance of dividends to the BTr, as mandated, the CAG 

was not able to maintain a database monitoring mechanism of the results of 

assessments, and other related information where complete information could be 

verified at any given time.  The CAG took note of the weakness in the monitoring of 

GOCCs’ dividends and informed of the plan to develop a system of monitoring the 

dividend remittances as their priority. 

 

The inability of  the CAG to provide the reports on the results of assessments 

made on the various issues in relation to the declaration of dividends and remittances  

and the absence of a database on its review of such dividends and actions thereon had 

not provided proof that the CAG had undertaken such review to ensure that the NG had 

received all revenues due to it, approvals on requests for dividend relief/downward 

adjustment  were granted  in accordance with the provision of pertinent laws, and 

under-remittances of dividends are justifiable based on the same laws and have been 

approved by the President of the Philippines upon recommendation of the Secretary of 

Finance.  

 

 



65 

 

We recommended that Management require the Director, CAG to: (a) 

provide the Audit Team with the results of its evaluation of  the requests for 

dividend reliefs/downward adjustments in dividends and related supporting 

documents to enable the verification of the validity and approval on non-/under-

remittances and requests for dividend relief/downward adjustments to facilitate 

verification of the correctness of dividend remittances and/or approval of 

dividend reliefs/downward adjustments in dividends.  

 

We also recommend that Management instruct the Director, CAG to 

provide the BTr the results of evaluation of the requests for dividend 

reliefs/downward adjustments in dividends to facilitate verification of the 

correctness of the dividends received from the GOCCs.

4. COVID-19 Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 
 

For CY 2020, the DOF had not received funds specifically for Coronavirus 

Disease 2019 (COVID-19) response and/or recovery but had utilized its budget for 

related expenses.   

 

COVID-19-related expenses charged to Personnel Services (PS) and 

Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) totaled P2.552 million and

P0.290 million, respectively.  The results of audit of these COVID-related transactions 

are as follows: 

 

On the provision of transportation facilities to employees on skeleton workforce  

 

Item C, Section 4.0 of Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular 

(MC) No. 18, s. 2020 requires that reasonable transportation facilities and housing 

quarters shall be provided to employees assigned as skeleton workforce, whenever 

practicable, and subject to budgeting, accounting and auditing rules and regulations. 

 

The DOF used its shuttle service vehicles to transport personnel on skeleton 

workforce from the declaration of the ECQ up to reporting date. Cash advances 

totaling P1.200 million were granted to the SDO, which covered the gasoline expenses 

and other related expenses such as the repair and maintenance of vehicles for CY 2020. 

Gasolines expenses, and toll fees and minor repairs recognized under Fuel, Oil and 

Lubricant Expenses and Other Maintenance and Operating Expenses totaled 

P221,759.15 and P42,275.01, respectively.

On the grant of hazard pay to employees during the ECQ 

 

Section 1 of Administrative Order (AO) No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 of the 

Office of the President authorized the national government agencies (NGAs) to grant 

COVID-19 hazard pay to personnel who physically reported for work during the 

implementation of ECQ in their respective work stations, in an amount not exceeding 

P500.00 per day per person. 

 

Section 2 of the same AO provides the conditions on the grant of the COVID-

19 hazard pay and that the heads of government agencies may grant the COVID-19 

hazard pay to their personnel/workers without the need for further approval by the 

Department of Budget and Management (DBM), subject to the following guidelines 

and conditions:  

 

1. The personnel are occupying regular, contractual or casual positions, or are 
workers engaged through contract of service (COS), job order (JO), or 

other similar schemes. 

 

2. The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work 
at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official 

working hours by the head of agency/office during the period of 

implementation of ECQ measures in the area of such office or work station. 

 

3. The total rate of the COVID-19 hazard pay shall be based on the number 
of days an employee/worker physically reports for work during the ECQ 

period using the formula under Section 1, which is P500.00 x No. of days 

physically reporting for work during the quarantine period. 

 

Review of the transactions recognized under account Hazard Pay and Other 

Professional Services for CY 2020 disclosed that the DOF granted COVID-19 hazard 

pay to regular employees and JO personnel at P500 per day totaling P2.552 million 

and P26,000.00, respectively, who reported to office during the ECQ (March 17 to 

May 15, 2020 ) and Modified ECQ (MECQ) (May 16 to 31, 2020 and  August 4 to 

18, 2020).  

 

Verification of the disbursement vouchers on the grant of hazard pay showed 

that the payments were supported with office orders of the DOF employees and JO 

personnel, authorized to work during the ECQ and MECQ, Daily Time Records and 

list of personnel who rendered service during the community quarantine. 

 

 

5. Gender and Development (GAD)  
 

Section 31 of the GAA for FY 2020 mentioned that all agencies of the 

government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their 



67 

 

mandate.  The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, 

which shall be at least five per cent of their budgets. 

 

The Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) endorsed the DOF’s GAD Plan 

and Budget (GPB) for CY 2020, with a budget of P1.983 million or 0.24 per cent of 

its P837 million appropriations in the FY 2020 GAA.                 

Based on the CY 2020 GAD Accomplishment Report (AR), the DOF 

implemented 12 out of 14 projects, activities and programs (PAPs), which include three 

PAPs undertaken but were not included in the GPB, with reported  expenses totaling 

P7.000 million. Among others, the GAD activities undertaken by the DOF are 

presented in Table 12.

(TWG) of DOF-GFPS, were not implemented during the year due to (a) the use of the 

majority of the funds of the MDFO to finance the government’s COVID-19 response, 

suspending the MDFO’s operations resulting in the non-attainment of the target 

database; and (b) the inability of the members of the DOF-GFPS to convene and to 

prioritize the implementation of GAD Capacity Development Programs with the 

prioritization of projects and programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and 

economic recovery, respectively.

The DOF generally complied with the provisions of the National Internal 

Revenue Code on the withholding of taxes and prompt remittance of all taxes withheld 

in compliance with DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 1-2000 dated January 3, 2000, 

as amended, and with existing regulations of the GSIS and Pag-IBIG on premium

8. GSIS Property Insurance Law (RA 656) 
 

The Department has not yet renewed its insurance policies on its properties with 

the GSIS for the period CY 2020-2021. The Management had submitted a letter dated 

October 20, 2020 to the GSIS stating that the updated Inventory List will be submitted 

to their Office by end of October for the purpose of policy renewal. The letter was 

received by the GSIS on October 21, 2020. 

  

On November 16, 2020, the DOF submitted an intent letter to the GSIS 

supported with the Property Insurance Form (PIF) for the renewal of insurance of its 

insurable properties which was received by the GSIS on November 18, 2020. The GSIS 

issued the insurance billing statements all dated November 14, 2020. The Audit Team 

noted that the DOF did not settle the billing statement since the amount insured of 

P978.656 million per billing statement is not equal to the amount in the PIF of P1.126 

billion submitted to the GSIS. Hence, the DOF communicated thru email on December 

16, 2020 this concern. 

 

According to the personnel assigned in the insurance of DOF’s property, there 

were several communications between the DOF and GSIS. The GSIS disclosed that the 

insurance billing statement of the DOF is for signature of their officials and it assured 

that the term of the insurance will start from the time of the expiration of the former 

policy. 

 

 

9.  Hiring of casuals, job orders, contractuals, and consultants 
  

For CY 2020, the DOF hired a total of 275 additional personnel, which 

consisted of 61 JOs, 192 outsourced personnel, and 22 consultants who provided 



71 

 

technical assistance and other related functions. The Management hired and paid the 

JOs and outsourced personnel  pursuant to CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular (JC) No. 1 

s. 2017 dated June 15, 2017, as amended by CSC-COA-DBM JC No. 1 s. 2018 dated 

November 9, 2018, and COA-DBM JC No. 1 s. 2020 dated March 19, 2020. 

Consultants were hired through negotiated procurement and paid based on the agreed 

contract, in consonance with Item 7, Annex H, RIRR, RA No. 9184. 

 

 

10.  Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges 
 

For CY 2020, no Notice of Suspension (NS), Notice of Disallowance (ND) and 

Notice of Charge (NC) were issued. Notice of Settlement of Suspensions, 

Disallowances and Charges (NSSDCs) issued during the year for settlements of 

P238,394.88 of disallowances in prior years pertain to: (a)  the partial settlement of
