and five Assistant Secretaries.  The DOF has a total manpower of 477 permanent 

officials and employees and 20 contractual employees as at December 31, 2020. To

C. Scope and Objectives of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial accounts and operations of the DOF for the year 

ended December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of 

assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements 

(FSs)  (b) determine the propriety of transactions, as well as the extent of compliance 

with pertinent laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency’s improvement 

opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit 

recommendations. 

 

 

D. Audit Methodology 
 

We adopted a risk-based audit approach in the audit of the FSs of the DOF and in the 

review of compliance with laws, rules and regulations.  The Audit Team which 

carried out the audit, among others: (i) examined financial and accounting procedures 

adopted by the DOF and other relevant documentation; (ii) assessed internal controls 

regulating financial operations and carried out compliance testing for determining 

the extent of control in operation; (iii) conducted substantive testing of a 

representative sample of selected transactions;  (iv) carried out review, on test check 

basis, of transactions related to movements in balances of assets, liabilities, revenues 

and expenses, and (v) conducted interviews and held discussions with the concerned 

officials and staff of the agency. 

 

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and the 

concerned officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda.   

 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

A qualified opinion was rendered on the fairness of presentation of the DOF’s FSs as 

at December 31, 2020 due to material accounting errors and omissions that affected

the account balances of Construction in Progress-Buildings and Other Structures, 

Buildings, Expenses accounts, Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit), Advances to 

Contractors and, Accounts Payable, as discussed in Part I -  Independent Auditor’s 

Report and in Part II - Observations and Recommendations of this report.  

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

Among the audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in Part 

II of this report, the significant observations are summarized as follows: 

 

1. Various accounting errors and omissions in the keeping of accounts resulted in 
the misstatements of some assets, liabilities, equity and expense accounts in the 

FSs. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant 

to analyze the related transactions and prepare the necessary adjusting 

entries to correct the aforementioned errors; and henceforth, observe the 

proper/correct recognition of accounts and transactions in accordance with 

the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies and 

other applicable rules and regulations. 

 

2. The existence, completeness and accuracy of the balances of several asset, 
liability and expense accounts were not ascertained due to discrepancies between 

the books and related records/reports, non-compliance with accounting standards 

and other issuances, and dormancy of accounts, among others. 

 
a. Funds transferred to Government Owned or Controlled Corporations 

(GOCCs) not liquidated within the prescribed period 
 

We recommended  and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant to: (a) demand the submission of the liquidation reports and 

related supporting documents  for all outstanding fund transfers as at 

December 31, 2020 and thereafter on a monthly basis, at year end or after 

project completion in order to recognize in the books expended/utilized 

amounts or any excess funds  to fairly present affected accounts  in the 

FSs as at  the end of the appropriate reporting period; and (b) recognize 

in the books the related disbursements or any excess funds from the fund 

transfers upon receipt of the liquidation reports.  

 

b. Unreconciled accounting and property records/report for Office Supplies 
Inventory 

 

i. Unaccounted net discrepancy between the Subsidiary Ledger Cards 
(SLCs), and Stock Cards (SCs) and Report on the Physical Count of 

Inventories (RPCIs) balances - P1.677 million 



iv 

 

 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant and the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), General 

Services Division (GSD) to reconcile the SLCs, SCs and the RPCIs’ 

balances and make the necessary adjustments in their respective 

records after reconciliation. 

 

ii. Dormant SLC balances - P864,844.19 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief 

Accountant to analyze the dormant SLC balances and to exert 

effort to gather the related documents for adjustment in the SLCs 

as necessary.  

 

iii. Unrecognized inventory items in the SLCs - P19,837.05 
 

We recommended that Management instruct the CAO, GSD to: (a) 

locate immediately the documents pertaining to inventory items 

totaling P19,837.05 and submit the same to the Accounting 

Division; and (b) henceforth, promptly provide the Accounting 

Division with the appropriate documents on the purchase of 

inventory items for the latter to recognize the inventories in the 

books. 

 

c.  Unliquidated balances of Advances to Special Disbursing Officer as at year-

end 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the concerned 

Special Disbursing Officers (SDOs) to ensure that all Cash Advances 

(CAs) for specific purposes or time-bound undertakings are liquidated 

immediately after the purpose for which the CA had been issued had 

been served, through the submission of liquidation reports and 

supporting documents, and/or refund of the unexpended balances of the 

CAs. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief 

Accountant to monitor unliquidated CAs through notification or demand 

letter to concerned SDOs to  help ensure that CAs are fully liquidate as 

at year-end. 

 

3. Non-submission of the results of the review of the dividend remittances and of 
the requests for dividend reliefs/downward adjustments in dividends, and absence 

of a database on such review had precluded the determination of the accuracy of 

the dividend remittance to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) and of the validity 

of/approval on the non-/under-remittances of dividends by the GOCCs. 

 



v 

 

 

Non-submission of the results of the review of the correctness of dividend 

remittances for the dividend years 2017-2019 

 

We recommended that Management require the Director, Corporate Affairs 

Group (CAG) to: (a) make available to the Audit Team the results of the 

review of the correctness of the computation of the dividends declared and 

remitted by the GOCCs to BTr and the related supporting documents to 

enable the assessment of its compliance with the said review; (b) ensure that 

all GOCCs  that are to declare and remit dividends do so every dividend year 

in order to improve the revenue generation of the National Government 

(NG); and (c) determine  the validity of the non-declaration and remittance 

of dividends by the GOCCs to the NG. 

 

We also recommend that Management direct the Director, CAG to: (a) 

coordinate with the BTr and request for a report on dividends received to  

determine if dividends determined  to be due to the NG had been received  

and that any non-remittance of dividends are valid and with the appropriate 

approval of the President of the Philippines or his authorized representative;  

and (b) agree with the BTr on which office will bill the GOCCs for non-

/under-remittances of dividends; and (c) provide the BTr with the results of 

the CAG’s review of the dividend remittances to provide the bases for 

verifying the correctness of dividends received and for the setting up of 

dividend receivables from GOCCs in case of shortfalls in remittances. 
 

Non-provision of the results of the evaluation of GOCCs’ request for dividend 

relief/downward adjustments in dividends, and related deficiencies 

 

We recommended that Management require the Director, CAG to: (a) 

provide the Audit Team with the results of its evaluation of  the requests for 

dividend reliefs/downward adjustments in dividends and related supporting 

documents to enable the verification of the validity and approval on non-

/under-remittances of dividends;  and (b) establish a database on its review 

of dividend remittances and requests for dividend relief/downward 

adjustments to facilitate verification of the correctness of dividend 

remittances and/or approval of dividend reliefs/downward adjustments in 

dividends.  

 

We also recommend that Management instruct the Director, CAG to provide 

the BTr the results of evaluation of the requests for dividend 

reliefs/downward adjustments in dividends to facilitate verification of the 

correctness of the dividends received from the GOCCs. 

 

The aforementioned observations and the corresponding recommendations were 

communicated to concerned officials through the issuance of the CY 2020 Summary 

of Audit Observations and Recommendations in lieu of an exit conference.
