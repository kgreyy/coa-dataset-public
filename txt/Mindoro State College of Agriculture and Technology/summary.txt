EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



Introduction



The Mindoro State College of Agriculture and Technology (MinSCAT) was first founded as Mindoro National Agricultural School (MINAS) on August 26, 1951.  On June 10, 1976, it was converted to Mindoro College of Agriculture and Technology (MCAT), then on May 25, 1995, it became a State College by virtue of Republic Act No. 8007, an “Act Converting MCAT to MinSCAT”. The two other existing CHED-Supervised Institutions (CSIs) in the Province of Oriental Mindoro, namely, the Polytechnic College of Calapan (PCC) and the Bongabong College of Fisheries (BCF), were subsequently integrated with MinSCAT pursuant to the pertinent provisions of Republic Act No. 8292, the Higher Education Modernization Act of 1977.   Republic Act No. 8760, otherwise known as the General Appropriations Act of 2000 first provided the unified appropriation for all the three campuses for its operating expenses.  On June 4, 2013, Republic Act No. 10596, “An Act converting MinSCAT into a State University to be known as the Mindoro State University (MinSU) and appropriating funds therefor” was signed by His Excellency President Benigno Simeon C. Aquino but the College has yet to comply with some requirements before it could be renamed as MinSU. 



	The College is currently headed by its President, Dr. Levy B. Arago, Jr. with Ms. Joelene C. Leynes as Vice President for Administration and Finance, Dr. Baldomero J. Bicaldo, Jr. as Vice President for Academic Affairs, Dr. Ma. Concepcion I. Mores as Vice President for Research, Development and Extension and assisted by the respective Administrators of the three campuses, as follows:

In addition, the following are other significant observations and recommendations in the audit of the College for the year 2020: 



1)	The College still maintains separate bank accounts for the two campuses despite the One Fund Concept policy, contrary to Section 3, Item N of Commission on Higher Education Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 20, s. of 2011, thus those bank accounts maybe considered unauthorized per Item 3.3 of Department of Finance, Department of Budget and Management and Commission on Audit Joint Circular No. 4, s. of 2012.



We recommended that Management cause the closure of all unauthorized bank accounts of Bongabong and Calapan Campuses and ensure that only one bank account is maintained for each type of fund for all collections made by the College  in compliance with Section 3, Item N of CMO No. 20, s. of 2011, unless specifically provided by law.



2)	Unserviceable properties recorded under Other Assets account in the Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020 and those included in the Report of Physical Count of Property Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) totaling P2,054,899.97 and P5,302,507.19, respectively, were not yet disposed by the College thereby exposing the assets to further deterioration, contrary to Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Manual on Disposal of Government Property prescribed under DBM National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 425.



We recommended that Management instruct the Supply/Property Units to prioritize the preparation of Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) to facilitate disposal of unserviceable properties as required under Section 79 of PD No. 1445 and DBM Manual on Disposal of Government Property.



3)	Salary differential, Representation and Transportation Allowance (RATA), and honoraria totaling P3,938,642.00 were paid out of the College Special Trust Fund (STF) contrary to Section 4(3) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, Section 4(d) of Republic Act (RA) No. 8292 and COA Circular No. 2000-002 dated April 4, 2000, thus defeated the intended purpose of the fund. In addition, RATA amounting to P564,500.00 and honoraria amounting to P159,515.00, respectively were paid to designated officials and to the BOT and Committee on Finance who are not entitled thereto in violation of DBM National Budget Circular (NBC) Nos. 548 and 461,  Republic Act No. 8292 and DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 2003-6.



We recommended that the Management: (a) stop the payment of salary differential, RATA and honoraria of the BOT/Finance Committee Members out of the STF; (b) strictly observe the rules and regulations on the use of STF as provided under CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, series of 2011, Section 4(3) of PD No. 1445, RA No. 8292, COA Circular No. 2000-002, 2017 ORAOHRA (Revised July 2018), DBM National Budget Circular No. 548, DBM NBC No. 404, s. 1989, DBM NBC No. 461 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2003-6 and ensure that future payments of the above-mentioned benefits are in compliance with the said laws, rules and regulations; (c) cause the refund of the paid salary differentials, RATA and honoraria without valid/legal basis and revert the  amount to the STF; (d) stop the payment of salary differential to designated College Vice-Presidents as per Section 13 (c) (7) of CSC Memorandum Circular No. 14, series of 2018 dated August 30, 2018, or the 2017 Omnibus Rules on Appointments and other Human Resource Actions (ORAOHRA), Revised July 2018; (e) make representation with the DBM to provide funds for the payments RATA to authorized College Officials per Section 4.5 of DBM National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 548 dated May 15, 2013, Section 4.0 of NBC No. 404, s. 1989 and Chapter 7, Section 7.13.2 of NBC No. 461 and per diems of the Chairperson and Members of the BOT and Finance Committee as per DBM Budget Circular No. 2003-6 dated September 29, 2003 in the General Appropriations Act in the ensuing year and onwards; and (f) stop the practice of paying honoraria to the Members of the BOT, instead provide them per diem and reimbursement of the necessary expenses incurred in attending Board meetings pursuant to DBM Budget Circular No. 2003-6 dated September 29, 2003.



4)	Technical specifications of seven (7) electric elevators with a total cost of P12,600,000.00 which is part of the Renovation/ Improvement/ Upgrading of Academic Buildings and Provision of Facilities for Persons with Disabilities (PWD) project were not indicated in the bidding documents contrary to Sections 12.1, 17.2 and 18 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184, thus, conformity and compliance needs of the College was not properly evaluated and assured.  



We recommended that the College President: (a) require the BAC and other concerned personnel to submit the detailed specifications of the seven electric elevators in support of the total cost of P12,600,000.00; and (b) instruct the members of the BAC to ensure that the College abides by the standards set forth in the 2016 RIRR of RA 9184 including the proper review of the technical specifications, scope of works, terms of references and bidding documents, among others, prior to the advertisement/posting of procurement opportunities. 



5)	Five (5) infrastructure projects were reported at only 13.28 to 67.73 percent completed as of the latest progress report despite the expiration of contract period and approved time extension due to the inability of the College to monitor and evaluate the performance of the contractors and devise calibrated measures in response to delays in the implementation, contrary to Item 12.1, Annex E of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 and Item 4.2 of GPPB Circular No. 03-2019 dated March 8, 2019. 



We recommended that the Management instruct the present Director for Auxiliary, Inspectorate Team and Engineer to: (a) furnish the Audit Team with copies of duly approved additional time extensions granted to the concerned contractors supported with documents such as Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) Resolutions for appropriate adjustments of the target date of completions of the above projects; and (b) evaluate the performance of contractors and implement calibrated measures in response to delays in implementation as per Item 12.1, Annex E of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184 and Item 4.2 of GPPB Circular No. 03-2019 dated March 8, 2019.



6)	Liquidated damages imposed to contractors of six projects were understated by P273,330.52 due to  erroneous  computation on the number of days delayed, inconsistent with Annex A of GPPB Resolution No. 02-2020 dated February 27, 2020, to the prejudice of the College.



We recommended that the Management instruct the Accountant and other concerned personnel to deduct the uncollected liquidated damages totaling P273,330.52 from any money  due to the concerned contractor/s or from the retention money or other securities posted by the contractor, or a combination thereof, whichever is convenient to them as per Annex A of GPPB Resolution No. 02-2020 dated February 27, 2020.



7)	The contract costs of six projects totaling P103,565,925.85 were found higher than the COA cost estimates of P79,035,284.01  by P24,530,641.84, as computed per Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Department Order (DO) No. 197 dated October 7, 2016, thus considered excessive expenditures defined under Section 5.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, to the prejudice of the government.



We recommended that the Management (a) submit the lacking documents such as the appropriate plans and complete details/specification of projects and work items, respectively to avoid suspension in audit of the payments for the projects Renovation/Improvement/Upgrading of Academic Buildings and Provision of Facilities for Persons with Disabilities (PWD), and Renovation/Improvement/Upgrading of Multi-Purpose Gymnasium and Student Activity Center, including ventilation, both located in Victoria Campus; and (b) require the Accountant and other concerned personnel to deduct from the amounts due to concerned contractors the cost deficiencies in four other projects in the above table totaling P488,403.21 or institute appropriate action to compel them to pay the amount, as the case may be. 



8)	The propriety and validity of payments out of Mandatory Reserve under the Special Trust Fund (STF) totaling P3,940,602.90 cannot be ascertained due to lack of supporting documents required in COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, in violation of Section 4(6) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445.



We recommended that Management direct the Accountant and other concerned personnel in the Accounting Office to i) ensure that future DVs are supported with complete documents before their submission to the Audit Team; and ii) submit the required documents enumerated in Annex E to avoid suspension in audit of the payments made.



9)	Financial reports, disbursement vouchers and other documents were submitted to the Audit Team 11 to 454 days beyond the prescribed period in violation of Section 60, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, and pertinent provisions in Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and other COA rules and regulations, thus precluded the Audit Team from the conduct of timely audit and rendition of reports. 



We reiterated our previous recommendations that Management (a) require the Accountant, Budget Officer, Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) Secretariat and concerned officers and employees to give priority in the preparation and submission of the required financial statements, accounting reports, records, other financial documents and supporting schedules and copies of contracts and its supporting documents within the prescribed period pursuant to pertinent provisions of PD 1445 and other COA Rules and Regulations; and (b) assign additional personnel to assist the Accountant in the preparation and submission of the required financial statements, accounting reports, records and other financial documents within the prescribed period to facilitate timely verification and audit of financial transactions of the College.



The above audit findings and recommendations were discussed with concerned officials and staff in an exit conference conducted on March 30, 2021. Management’s comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate.
