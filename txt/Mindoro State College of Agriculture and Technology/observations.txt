PART II - DETAILED OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)	Financial and Compliance



Doubtful balances of Cash in Bank-Local Currency-Current Account- P250,065,311.46, Accounts Receivable- P7,048,966.88, Inventories-P4,442,582.69, Property, Plant and Equipment-P631,326,415.69 and Biological Assets-P1,450,849.77





1)	The correctness, existence and reliability of the balances of Cash in Bank- Local Currency Current Account (CIB-LCCA) totaling P250,065,311.46, Accounts Receivable totaling P7,048,966.88, Inventories totaling P4,442,582.69, Property, Plant and Equipment with carrying amount of P631,326,415.69 and Biological Assets totaling P1,450,849.77 as of December 31, 2020 are doubtful due to lapses/errors in recording, classifying and reconciling the accounts as required under pertinent provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) and Presidential Decree No. 1445, thus affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the Statement of Financial Position of the College. 



Section 7, Chapter 19, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) provides that financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs). The application of IPSASs, with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair presentation.



As of December 31, 2020, the Statement of Financial Position (SFPos) of the College reported a balance of P250,065,311.46, P7,048,966.88, P4,442,582.69, P631,326,415.69 and P1,450,849.77  for the Cash in Bank- Local Currency, Current Account (CIB-LCCA), Accounts Receivable, Inventories, Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and Biological Assets accounts, respectively, broken down as follows:

Audit of the above mentioned accounts for CY 2020 disclosed the following lapses and deficiencies that casted doubts on the correctness, existence and reliability of these asset accounts, thereby affecting their fair presentation in the Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020. 





Cash in Bank- Local Currency, Current Account (CIB-LCCA)



a)	  Book reconciling items particularly unrecorded deposits totaling P3,949,604.70  as of year-end, was not yet adjusted, thus, understated the balance of the CIB- LCCA. 



Chapter 21, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) provides:



--	The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the Government Servicing Bank (GSB), reconcile the BS with the General Ledger (GL) and prepare the Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) in four copies. (Section 5)



--	The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall prepare a Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the books of accounts. (Section 6) [Emphasis ours]



Review and verification of the submitted bank reconciliation statements of the College for the month of December 2020 revealed that unrecorded deposits since CY 2015 of Calapan and Main Campuses were not yet recognized or taken-up in the books of accounts, thus understating the balance of the CIB- LCCA of the College as at year-end, as summarized in the table below:

TOTAL





P3,949,604.70



Per inquiry with the Accountant, Cashier and Collecting Officer, the unrecorded transactions were directly deposited by the payees to the bank without informing the College of the deposits made and no copies of machine validated deposit slips were furnished as basis for the issuance of the corresponding official receipts and eventual recording thereof. 



Based on the Statement of Financial Position and Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS), the above reconciling items remain unadjusted contrary to above cited Section 6, Chapter 21 of GAM, Volume I, thus understating the CIB-LCCA balance as of December 31, 2020 and affecting its fair presentation.



Further review of the BRS disclosed other reconciling items such as over recording of collection and bank errors, as described in the table below including relevant information gathered as a result of inquiry.



Nature/Type

Amount (Php)

Over recording of collection due to erroneous recording of STF collections under Official Receipts (OR) Nos. 327453-327454 dated October 22, 2020 both in the RCD and CRR of Special Trust Fund (STF) and Trust Fund (TF).

4,100.00

Erroneous Bank Charges- bank’s erroneous debiting of Regular Agency Fund (RAF) and TF checks from STF account resulting to insufficiency of STF bank balance to cover subsequent issued checks.

4,400.00

Bank errors- for debiting the amount of P3,580.00  instead of P3,366.00 only per STF Check No. 1430304 dated July 10, 2017.

214.00



The Cashier informed that the erroneous recording of STF collections totaling P4,100.00 both in the RCD and in the CRR of STF and TF was due to confusion caused by the voluminous transactions and lack of personnel assistance. 



The College Accountant informed that they have already brought the matter to the bank who agreed to revert the erroneously charged bank penalty of P4,400.00 upon receipt of the request letter from the College.  Unfortunately, the amount of P4,400.00 was not yet reverted by the bank to date because  the College Accountant forgot to prepare and submit the necessary request letter.





b)	  Unrecorded balance of Trust Fund from Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice) amounting to P43,556.27, contrary to pertinent provisions in Presidential Decree No. 1445.



Section 66 of Presidential Decree No. 1445  provides that Receipt of special, fiduciary and trust funds shall be recorded as income of special, fiduciary or trust funds or funds other than the General Fund only when authorized by law as implemented by rules and regulations issued by the Permanent Committee xxx. 



Verification of the CIB-LCCA balance of the College as of December 31, 2020 also revealed that the remaining balance of the Trust Fund from PhilRice amounting to P43,556.27, deposited in the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) with account number 0502-1064-49 and under the name of the College, was not recorded in the books of accounts, contrary to the above cited provisions of PD No. 1445, thereby understating the balance of the CIB-LCCA as at year-end by the same amount. 



Inquiry with the Accountant and Budget Officer revealed that the balance of the TF from PhilRice was not recorded in the books of accounts although it is in the name of the College, for it was formerly managed and disbursed directly by the personnel of PhilRice and that they have no knowledge of the nature and purpose of the remaining balance of P43,556.27. 





c)	  Non-maintenance of Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) for each bank accounts, contrary to Volume II of the GAM



Volume II of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) provides that the Accounting Office shall maintain Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) which shall shows the details for each control account in the General Leger (GL) per account and fund cluster and that every end of the month, totals between SLs and GL control account should be reconciled. Xxx.



Verification of the CIB-LCCA of the College also revealed that the required subsidiary ledgers for all the CIB accounts were not prepared and maintained, thus reconciliation of the totals of these SLs balances with its controlling account in the GL was not undertaken, hence casting doubts on the reliability of recorded balance of CIB-LCCA totaling P250,065,311.46 as at year-end.



The  Accountant justified that failure prepare and maintain the required SL was mainly  due to other task of greater importance but committed to prepare the SLs for RAF and STF this year.  





We recommended that Management:

	

i)	instruct the Accountant to facilitate the documentation and proper recording of all the remaining reconciling items in the books of accounts and submit copies of JEVs to the Audit Team as proof of compliance;

	

ii)	instruct the Accountant, Budget Officer and other concerned personnel to coordinate with the PhilRice officials and verify on the status of remaining balance of Trust Fund deposited in the name of the College to determine the appropriate actions to be undertaken.  If the fund is no longer needed, return/remit the unexpended balance to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr); and 



iii)	instruct the Accountant and other concerned personnel to prioritize the preparation and maintenance of SLs for each bank accounts and reconcile it with the control account in the GL monthly as required under Volume II of the GAM to ensure accuracy and reliability of the recorded CIB balances.



Management commented that appropriate letters of instructions were issued to the concerned key personnel to attend to our recommendations and that initial coordination with PhilRICE have been undertaken.

 

In addition, the Accountant and the Cashier commented that they have already facilitated the documentation and recording of some of these unrecorded direct deposits to the bank accounts and will submit copies of Journal Entry Vouchers (JEV) and supporting documents as proof of compliance. Also they informed that they already started the preparation of the required SLs per bank accounts. 





Receivables



d)	  Allowance for Impairment Loss was not provided on Accounts Receivable from school fees totaling P5,345,297.43, of which the collectability of the said amount has ceased to be probable, contrary to  Section 9, Chapter 5 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I,  thus the net realizable value of the asset was not correctly presented in the financial statement.



Section 9, Chapter 5 of GAM, Volume I, provides that in accounting for revenue and other receipts, when an uncertainty arises about the collectability of an amount already included in revenue, the uncollectible amount, or the amount in respect of which recovery has ceased to be probable, is recognized as an expense (impairment losses), rather than as an adjustment of the amount of revenue originally recognized. Entities shall evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable on an ongoing basis based on historical bad debts, customer/recipient credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in payment activity. An allowance is provided for known and estimated bad debts. [Emphasis our]



Review and verification of the submitted Aging Schedule of Account Receivables revealed that out of the past due accounts of P6,899,167.87, allowance for impairment losses for the recorded receivables in the total amount of P5,345,297.43 from school fees whose collectability is uncertain or not probable, were not provided, contrary to the above mentioned provision of the GAM, thus overstating the net realizable value of recorded Receivables as at year-end as presented in the table below:

e)	  Accounts Receivable totaling P4,072,521.87 that remained dormant for more than 10 years were not written-off contrary to COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 was issued by the Commission on Audit (COA), by virtue of its exclusive authority under Section 2 (2), Article IX-D of the 1987 Philippine Constitution prescribing the guidelines and procedures in reconciling and cleaning the books of accounts of National Government Agencies (NGAs), Local Government Units (LGUs), and Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) of, among others, dormant receivable accounts or those receivables that remained inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for ten (10) years or more and where settlement or collectivity could no longer be ascertained for fair presentation of accounts in the financial statements.



Verification of the submitted Aging Schedule of Account Receivables also revealed that out of the past due accounts totaling P6,899,167.87,  59.03 percent or P4,072,521.87 remained inactive or non-moving for ten years or more thus, considered dormant.  However, the Management did not file a request for authority to write-off the dormant accounts to the Audit Team as required under COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, thus the said accounts remained in the College’s books of accounts.





f)	  Accounts Receivables and Other Receivables totaling P1,576,230.72 and P12,146.00, respectively, were  not properly classified to the appropriate accounts. 



In the previous year, the Audit Team noted misclassified accounts, as follows:

Verification showed that the recommendation to reclassify the above transactions to appropriate accounts prescribed under the RCA in GAM, Volume III, were not yet effected by the concerned Accountant, thus overstating the balance of Receivables and Other Receivables by P1,576,230.72 and P12,146.00, respectively, and understating the balance of Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) by P98,000.00, Due from Other Funds by P1,454,702.60, Due from Officers and Employees by P40,029.36, Accounts Payables by P0.24, Due to Other Funds by P340.00 and Other Payables by P4,015.00.



In an inquiry, the Accountant informed that the provision of allowance for impairment losses for Receivables whose recovery are uncertain or not probable, the necessary actions on dormant receivable accounts and the reclassification of Receivables to appropriate accounts prescribed in the RCA under GAM, Volume III, were not yet undertaken due to their attendance on other matters of equal importance and reduced work schedules during community quarantines because of COVID-19 pandemic. 





We reiterated our previous recommendations that Management instruct the Accountant and other concerned personnel to:



a)	set-up/provide adequate Allowance for Impairment Loss for recorded account receivables which  are uncertain or improbable of collection as per Section 9, Chapter 5 of GAM, Volume I;



	ii.   prioritize  the verification, analysis, validation, gathering of supporting documents and request authority from COA for the write-off of dormant accounts receivable accounts of the College pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016; 



iv)	take the necessary adjusting journal entries to reclassify recorded Receivables to appropriate accounts in accordance with  the Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) under the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume III; and 



v)	submit to the Audit Team copies of Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) and supporting documents as proof of compliance with the above-cited recommendations on provision of allowance for impairment losses and reclassification of recorded Receivables to appropriate accounts under the RCA.



The Management agreed with the recommendations and commented that the Accountant and concerned key personnel were already instructed to address and implement them this year. 





Inventories 



g)	  Issued semi-expendable properties totaling P3,663,372.00 were still recognized as inventory account  instead of the appropriate expense accounts, contrary to Item b of Section 10, Chapter 8 of GAM, Volume I, thus, overstated the balance of Inventory and understated the expense accounts. 



Item b of Section 10, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I, provides that tangible items below the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 shall be accounted as semi-expendable property and that these tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon issue to end-user. [Emphasis ours] 



In order to establish accountability over this semi-expendable properties, Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) shall be issued to concerned end-user and this accountability shall be extinguished only upon the return of the item to the Property and Supply Division/Unit, or in case of loss, upon approval of the relief from property accountability. (Section 11, Chapter 8 of GAM, Volume I)



Verification of Inventory accounts as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that Semi-expendable Information and Communication Technology Equipment, Semi-expendable Technical and Scientific Equipment, Semi-expendable Furniture and Fixtures and Semi-expendable Books, totaling P34,350.00, P99,610.00, P82,220.00 and P3,447,192.00, respectively, were already issued to end-users, however they were not yet recognized as Expense contrary to the provisions of Item b of Section 10, Chapter 8 of GAM, Volume I, thus overstating the balance of Inventory and understating the related expenses accounts as at year-end. 



Interview with the Accountant disclosed that the recorded semi-expendable properties totaling P3,663,372.00 were items that were previously included in the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts that were reclassified to appropriate semi-expendable property accounts. However, due to absence of ICS and approved Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS), recognition of appropriate expenses was not yet effected in the books of accounts.





We recommended that Management instruct the Accounting Office to coordinate with the Supply Office or concerned end-users with issued semi-expendable properties to provide copies of Requisition and Issue Slips (RIS) and Inventory Custodian Slips (ICS) as basis in recording the issued semi-expendable properties as expenses as per Item b of Section 10, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I.



The Management is amenable with our recommendations and commented that proper instructions have been issued to the concerned key personnel to address them. 



Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE)



h)	  Incomplete physical count of PPE in Bongabong Campus contrary to Section 38, Chapter 10 of GAM, Volume I. 



Section 38, Chapter 10 of GAM, Volume I, for NGAS provides that the entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording.



For CY 2020, the College conducted physical count of PPE in Main and Calapan Campuses and submitted the required RPCPPE on February 26 and March 8, 2021, respectively, but not in Bongabong Campus due to the resignation of the staff tasked to conduct the activity.   Instead, they submitted RPCPPE on March 5, 2021 based on the Property Acknowledgement Receipts (PAR) on file, inconsistent with the provisions in Chapter 10, Section 38, Volume I of GAM for NGAS, thus casting doubts on the existence and completeness of PPE in Bongabong Campus.  



As previously emphasized, the annual physical inventory count and the preparation of the inventory reports are indispensable procedures for checking the integrity of property custodianship and validation of the accuracy of the book balances. 

i)	  Discrepancies totaling (P81,985,839.40) between the costs of PPE per submitted RPCPPE and Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020, inconsistent with Chapter 10, Section 38 of GAM, Volume I.



Verification and comparison of the costs of PPE per submitted RPCPPE with the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position (SFPos) of the College as of December 31, 2020 revealed discrepancies in the total amount of (P81,985,839.40) as follows:

Non-reconciliation of the amounts per RPCPPE with the accounting records is contrary to the provisions in Chapter 10, Section 38 of GAM, Volume I, which provides, among others, that the entity shall have a periodic physical count and equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording, thus casting doubts on the accuracy and reliability of the recorded PPEs and affecting their fair presentation in the SFPos as of December 31, 2020.



In addition, it was also noted that the RPCPPE lacks necessary information for each property, especially the property number which could help ease the physical count contrary to Appendix 73 of GAM, Volume II. 



Inquiry with the Accountant revealed that copies of RPCPPE prepared by the Supply Officers of the three Campuses were not forwarded to her Office hence, the reconciliation of the noted discrepancies such as those equipment that were found in station but were not recorded in the books of accounts as well as the adjustments of losses, if any were not facilitated.



As also previously emphasized, it is important that the PPE balances per physical inventory reports and per books are in agreement at all times to ensure reliability of the reported balances in the financial statements, thus discrepancies noted should be immediately adjusted in the books.





j)	  Inclusion of issued items below the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 in the PPE accounts totaling P37,634,674.27, contrary to Chapter 10, Section 4 and Chapter 8, Section 10 of GAM, Volume I.



Review of the submitted schedules for PPE of the College showed that issued items below the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 totaling P37,634,674.27 were still carried in the books as PPE despite our previous year’s recommendation of adjusting the same to inventory items, pursuant to Chapter 10, Section 4 of GAM, Volume 1, for NGAs, which provides the application of capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 as the minimum cost of an individual asset to be recognized as PPE in the Statement of Financial Position. Tangible assets below the capitalization threshold shall be accounted for as semi-expendable property and shall be recognized as expenses upon issue to end-user in compliance with Chapter 8, Section 10 of GAM, Volume I, for NGAs. Consequently, this resulted in the overstatement of PPE and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts by P37,634,674.27 as at year-end. Details are as follows:

Inquiry with the Accountant revealed that they were not able to prioritize the adjustment of these issued semi- expendable properties to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account due to their attendance to other task of equal importance that were also included in our previous year’s recommendation. Nevertheless, the Accountant committed to prioritize the identification and analysis of these issued semi-expendable properties for eventual reclassification.





k)	  Non-maintenance of PPE Ledger Cards (PPELCs) and Property Cards (PCs) by the Accounting and Supply Office, respectively, contrary to Chapter 10, Section 42 of the GAM, Volume I



Chapter 10, Section 42 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that the Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall be also reconciled with other property records like PAR. The forms and the instructions in accomplishing them were provided in Appendix 69 and 70 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II.



Verification of property records for CY 2020 revealed that preparation and maintenance of the required PPELCs were still not performed by the Accounting Office which, according to the Accountant was due to voluminous transactions and lack of personnel in their office.  Meanwhile, verification of records in the Property/Supply Office disclosed that only PPEs acquired in CY 2020 were recorded in PPELC instead of PC, contrary to the provisions in Section 42, Chapter 10 of GAM, Volume I cited above.  





l)	  Equipment and major repairs and maintenance of buildings and equipment totaling P3,817,928.50 paid out of Mandatory Reserve were recorded as Other Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (OMOOE) instead of the appropriate Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts contrary to pertinent provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, hence,  understated the  asset accounts and overstated  the expense/equity  accounts.



Pertinent provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, on the recognition of an asset as PPE on the Statement of Financial Position (SFPos) includes, among others, the following:



--	The cost of an item of PPE shall be recognized as asset if, and only if it meets the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00. (Section 3.e)



--	Items with individual values below the threshold but which work together in the form of a group of network asset whose total value exceeds the threshold shall be recognized as part of the primary PPE. (Example: computer network, PABX system, sewerage system). (Section 4.a)



--	Repairs and maintenance primarily maintain or improve the functionality and capacity of the PPE; increase its service life; improve the quality of its output; or reduce the operating cost. These may be categorized into major and minor repairs. Minor repairs shall be directly charged to expense account “Repairs and Maintenance” of the specific PPE while major repairs shall be added to the carrying amount of the PPE and shall be depreciated over the remaining life of the PPE. Where cost cannot easily be differentiated between a minor or major repair, it shall be treated as expense. X x x (Section 24)



Review of the payments of expenditures out of the Mandatory Reserve Fund and   financial statements revealed that procured equipment and supplies and materials for the repair/rehabilitation of buildings/equipment were taken up in the books as expenses under the Other MOOE account even though some of these meet the criteria to be recognized as PPE in the SFPos. Details are as follows:

The misclassification of the above disbursements resulted in the overstatement of the Other MOOE account by P3,817,928.50 and understatement of the related PPE by the same amount as at year-end, contrary to the above cited provisions of the GAM, Volume I.



The Accountant admitted the error and committed to reclassify the same to the appropriate PPE accounts this year.  





We recommended and reiterated our previous recommendations that Management:



a)	assign new personnel/Inventory Committee to conduct complete annual physical count of PPE as of December 31 of each year and prepare and submit the corresponding Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) to the Auditor concerned and Accounting Division/Unit not later than January 31 of each year; 



ii. 	instruct the Inventory Committee to furnish the Accounting Office of their RPCPPE for each year and reconcile the costs of PPE per RPCPPE and amounts recorded in the books of accounts as per Section 38, Chapter 10 of GAM, Volume I;



iii.  instruct the Accounting Office to prioritize and exert extra efforts to reclassify to appropriate accounts those items which are below the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 but were still recognized as PPE and submit copies of Journal Entry Voucher to the Audit Team as proof of compliance; 



iv. assign additional personnel in the Accounting and Supply Office, respectively of all Campus to assist in the preparation, updating and maintenance of the prescribed property records for each type of property and equipment and ensure that these are properly reconciled with the RPCPPE and the control accounts and any discrepancies shall be immediately verified and adjusted; and 



v.   direct the Accountant to reclassify to appropriate PPE accounts  the disbursements totaling P3,817,928.50 erroneously recorded under Other MOOE accounts and submit copies of Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to the Audit Team as proof of compliance.



The Management commented that instructions have been issued to concerned key personnel to address our recommendations and that since they don’t have enough funds for hiring additional personnel, the duties and responsibilities of the existing personnel are rationalized to facilitate the conduct of physical count of College PPE, preparation, updating, maintenance and reconciliation of accounting and property records. 





Biological Assets



m)	   The Quarterly Report of Biological Assets (QRBA) was not submitted by the caretaker of biological assets, inconsistent with Chapter 11, Section 11 of GAM, Volume I.



For CY 2020, the Biological Asset’s Caretakers of the College failed to submit, through the Director for Production and Business Operations (DPBO), to the Accounting Office, the required QRBA contrary to Chapter 11, Section 11 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, for National Government Agencies which provides the procedures on the acquisition and recognition of Biological Assets, which includes the following:



--	The Biological Asset’s Caretaker/responsible person prepare the Quarterly Report of Biological Assets (QRBA) containing, among others, the balances at the beginning of the quarter and the changes in fair value of the biological assets due to physical changes such as: a) growth, b) degeneration, c) production, and d) procreation; and

--	Submit the QRBA to the Accounting division/unit.

	

	Inquiry with the concerned DPBO revealed that each caretaker prepares the “Monthly Inventory Records” for their animal and agricultural crop projects.  Copies of said records were furnished to the College Supply Office, however, they were not aware/informed that they are also required to submit same reports and the QRBA to the Accounting Office. 



Since the biological asset’s caretaker failed to submit the required QRBA to the Accounting Office, the accuracy of the Biological Assets recorded in the books of accounts may not be reliable.  It also hindered the Accounting Office to recognize any gain or loss due to physical and price changes of the assets and to reconcile the carrying amounts of breeding stocks.  Thus, the amount of Biological Assets recorded in the SFPos as of December 31, 2020 is doubtful. 



In addition, the Statement of Financial Position, Statement of Financial Performance and Reconciliation of the carrying amounts of the Breeding Stocks required under Section 13, Chapter 11 of the same Manual were not prepared by the Accounting Office due to absence of QRBA, thus the financial condition as well as the results of operation/performance of breeding stocks for CY 2020 cannot be determined. 





n)	  Non-maintenance of Biological Asset’s Property Cards (BAPCs) and Subsidiary Ledgers for Biological Assets by the Caretakers and Accounting Office, respectively, contrary to Chapter 11, Section 11 of GAM, Volume I



Verification of the Biological Assets account also revealed that both the Caretakers and Accounting Office did not prepare and maintain the Biological Assets Property Cards (BAPC) and Subsidiary Ledgers (SL) for Biological Assets, respectively, contrary to Section 11 Chapter 11 GAM for NGAs, Volume I which provides the procedures of the acquisition and recognition of assets requiring the use of Biological Asset Property Cards (BAPC) which shall be kept by the Biological Asset’s Caretaker or Officer-in-Charge for each class or type of biological assets to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, transfer, disposal and other information about the property.



The DPBO, who is in-charge of the supervision of the Caretakers, confirmed the absence of BAPC since he assumed his post.  The Accountant also stated that the main reason for the non-preparation and non-maintenance of the required BAPC and SLs for Biological Assets was due to voluminous transaction and lack of personnel in the Accounting Office. Consequently, it resulted to difficulty in verifying the accuracy of the reported balance of biological assets totaling P1,450,849.77 as at year-end.





We recommended that Management instruct the Biological Assets’ Caretakers, through the Director for Production and Business Operations (DPBO): 



a)	 to regularly submit the Quarterly Report of Biological Assets (QRBA) to the Accounting Office for proper recording and the latter to prepare the required financial and reconciliation statements for Breeding Stocks as per Sections 11 and 13, Chapter 11 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I; and 



b)	to exert efforts in finding records that they can use in the preparation and maintenance of Biological Assets Property Cards (BAPC) for each class or type of assets or refer to their “Monthly Inventory Records” as starting point and assign additional personnel in the Accounting Office to assist in the preparation and maintenance of the required SLs for Biological Assets, respectively.



Management commented that appropriate communications were already issued to the identified concerned key personnel to address our recommendations. 





Unauthorized bank accounts



2)	The College still maintains separate bank accounts for the two campuses despite the One Fund Concept policy, contrary to Section 3, Item N of Commission on Higher Education Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 20, s. of 2011, thus those bank accounts maybe considered unauthorized per Item 3.3 of Department of Finance, Department of Budget and Management and Commission on Audit Joint Circular No. 4, s. of 2012.



Section 3, Item N, of Commission on Higher Education Memorandum Circular (CMO) No. 20, s. 2011 dated August 4, 2011 provides that only one depository account for one type of fund will be maintained for all collections made by the State Universities and Colleges (SUCs). It shall be deposited in the official depository bank, government bank or government accredited commercial or depository bank. (One Fund Concept)



Item 3.3 of DOF, DBM and COA Joint Circular No. 4, s. of 2012 dated September 11, 2012 provides that unauthorized accounts refer to cash account balances maintained by agencies without specific authority or legal basis or cash account balances with a specific authority but maintained with non-Authorized Government Depository Banks (AGDBs).



In prior years, the three campuses of the College separately maintained its own bank accounts with the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP)- Calapan Branch located at Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro, as depository and disbursement accounts for different types of fund.  In CY 2020, the College adopted the One Fund Concept with centralized operations in the Main Campus located at Alcate, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro.  



Review and verification of the Cash in Bank- Local Currency Current Account of the College for CY 2020 revealed however, that the bank accounts of Calapan and Bongabong Campuses were not yet closed even after the implementation of the One Fund Concept, contrary to the above cited provision of CMO No. 20, s. 2011.  Thus, the following bank accounts of the two campuses may be considered unauthorized per Item 3.3 of DOF, DBM & COA Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012. Details are as follows:

Upon inquiry with the Accountant, she justified that the balances of the Regular Agency Fund (RAF) and Special Trust Fund (STF) bank accounts of Bongabong and Calapan Campuses are being used for payment of payables and will be closed thereafter. For the Trust Fund – Senior High School Voucher Program (TF-SHSVP) bank accounts, the same could not be closed either as it is required under DepEd Order No. 46, series of 2015, as depository account for SHSVP participating schools. It was further commented that they still need to properly scrutinize and verify the composition of the Trust Fund (TF) bank accounts as it involves grants that needs to be returned to the source agencies; and that the TF bank accounts for Cafeteria and Income Generating Projects (IGPs) of Calapan Campus are still not closed for easy monitoring of said accounts. 



The justifications given maybe true, but the College has to comply with the provision of CMO No. 20, s. of 2011 requiring SUCs to maintain only one depository account for one type of fund.





We recommended that Management cause the closure of all unauthorized bank accounts of Bongabong and Calapan Campuses and ensure that only one bank account is maintained for each type of fund for all collections made by the College  in compliance with Section 3, Item N of CMO No. 20, s. of 2011, unless specifically provided by law.



Management commented that appropriate letters of instruction were already issued to concerned key personnel to attend to our audit recommendations. They also agreed to close some of these bank accounts except for IGP and Cafeteria in Calapan Campus accounts. The Audit Team advised the Management to transfer the ending balances of the IGP and the said Cafeteria bank accounts to the Main Campus account and maintain subsidiary ledgers to record and monitor the transactions.  



Undisposed unserviceable properties



3)	Unserviceable properties recorded under Other Assets account in the Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020 and those included in the Report of Physical Count of Property Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) totaling P2,054,899.97 and P5,302,507.19, respectively, were not yet disposed by the College thereby exposing the assets to further deterioration, contrary to Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Manual on Disposal of Government Property prescribed under DBM National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 425.



 Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that when government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the Commission, after advertising by printed notice in the Official Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of general circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the expense of publication, by notices posted for a like period in at least three public places in the locality where the property is to be sold. In the event that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned and approved by the Commission.



Pertinent provisions of the Manual on Disposal of Government Property prescribed under Department of Budget and Management (DBM) National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 425 dated January 28, 1992 provides the following:



--	Any or all of the following conditions shall constitute disposable property: a) property which can no longer be repaired or reconditioned; b) property whose maintenance cost/costs of repair more than outweighs the benefits and services that will be derived from its continued use; c) property that has become obsolete or outmoded because of changes in technology; d) serviceable property that has been rendered unnecessary due to change in the agency’s function or mandate; e) unused supplies, materials and spare parts that were procured in excess of requirements; and f) unused supplies and materials that became dangerous to use because of long storage or use of which is determined to be hazardous. (Part II.B)



Review of the financial statements of the College for the period ended December 31, 2020 revealed that unserviceable properties totaling P2,054,899.97 were reported in the Statement of Financial Position (SFPos) under the Other Assets account while verification of Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) for CY 2020 disclosed that it includes also unserviceable properties and demolished structures totaling P5,302,507.19 that are yet to be disposed, as follows:

Interview with the Accountant revealed that based on the Schedule of Depreciation on file, out of the recorded unserviceable properties under Other Assets account in the total amount of P2,054,899.97, 99 percent or  P2,035,149.97 had been reported and carried in the books of accounts for more than ten years while the remaining 1 percent or P19,750.00 pertains to fully depreciated library books that were acquired in CY 2014.  



The Supply Officer admitted the erroneous recording of the unserviceable and demolished structures in the RPCPPE and confirmed that preparation and completion of the IIRUP to facilitate the disposal is now on-going. 



The failure of the Supply and Property Officer to immediately dispose the unserviceable properties exposed them to further deterioration thus deprived the College of the benefits of a higher disposable value and the availability of storage facilities for other purposes.  





We recommended that Management instruct the Supply/Property Units to prioritize the preparation of Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) to facilitate disposal of unserviceable properties as required under Section 79 of PD No. 1445 and DBM Manual on Disposal of Government Property.



The Management commented that instructions have been issued to concerned key personnel and the Supply Officer and committed to prioritize the preparation of IIRUP and facilitate disposal of those unserviceable properties within this year. 





4)	Salary differential, Representation and Transportation Allowance (RATA), and honoraria totaling P3,938,642.00 were paid out of the College Special Trust Fund (STF) contrary to Section 4(3) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, Section 4(d) of Republic Act (RA) No. 8292 and COA Circular No. 2000-002 dated April 4, 2000, thus defeated the intended purpose of the fund. In addition, RATA amounting to P564,500.00 and honoraria amounting to P159,515.00, respectively were paid to designated officials and to the BOT and Committee on Finance who are not entitled thereto in violation of DBM National Budget Circular (NBC) Nos. 548 and 461,  Republic Act No. 8292 and DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 2003-6.



Section 4(3) of Presidential Degree (PD) No. 1445 states that “Trust Funds shall be available and may be spent only for the specific purpose for which the trust was created or the funds received”.



Section 4(d) of Republic Act (RA) No. 8292 also provides that any income generated by the University or College from tuition fees and other charges, as well as from the operation of auxiliary services and land grants, shall be retained by the University or College, and may be disbursed by the Board of Regents/Trustees for instruction, research, extension, or other programs/projects of the University or College: Provided, that all fiduciary fees shall be disbursed for the specific purposes for which they are collected. 



Section 2.1.4 of COA Circular No. 2000-002 dated April 4, 2000 provides that “In no case shall the STF be used for the payment of salaries and the creation of new position”.



Post-audit of the disbursement vouchers of the College revealed that payments for salary differential of two designated College Vice-Presidents (VPs), RATA of designated VPs, Deans of Colleges, Directors and Department/Unit Heads and honoraria of Board of Trustees (BOT) and BOT Finance Committee totaling P1,954,427.00, P1,930,800.00 and P53,415.00, respectively, were charged against the College STF contrary to Section 4(3) of  PD 1445, Section 4(d) of RA 8292 and Section 2.1.4 of COA Circular No. 2000-002.  



Management justified that funds for the salary differential of the designated VPs were included in the College Programs of Receipts and Expenditure (PRE) on internally generated income for FYs 2019 and 2020, duly approved by the BOT and that payments of RATA were sourced from  STF since there is no provision for the purpose in the GAA and the College BOT has the power to authorize the use of income generated as deemed necessary and urgent for the attainment of its objectives and goals under Section 4(d )of RA 8292 and Section 2.2 of COA Circular No. 2000-02 dated April 4, 2000.



Management further clarified that the charging of honoraria to the STF was based on provisions of Commission on Higher Education Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 20, s. 2011 that the SUC shall provide for the common fund out of which the expenditures considered as SUC wide common administrative cost shall be paid which includes, cost in the holding of BOR/T meeting, travel expenses of the BOR/T members, honoraria and other incentives of the BOR/T.



However, Section 2.1.4 of COA Circular No. 2000-002 dated April 4, 2000 strictly provides that the use of STF for payment of salaries is not allowed. 



Also, Section 13.1.1 of DBM National Budget Circular No. 548 dated May 15, 2013 states that the amount required for the grant of commutable or reimbursable RATA to the incumbents or OICs of regular positions and to designated officials in SUCs shall be charged to the respective agency appropriations/budgets for the purpose. In case of deficiencies, the same shall be charged against agency savings. [Emphasis ours]



Moreover, Section 4(d) of Republic Act (RA) No. 8292 limits the use of income generated by the University or College for instruction, research, extension, or other programs/projects of the University or College.  The Supreme Court even clarified in its decision in the case of Ricardo E. Retoras vs Commission on Audit, G.R. No. 211999, promulgated on August 20, 2019 that “Meetings of the state university and Colleges governing boards cannot be considered as instruction, research, extension, or any other similar project or program” 



  The Audit Team also noted the following irregularities in the payment salary differential, RATA and honoraria:





a)	  The payment of salary differential to two designated College Vice-Presidents totaling P1,954,427.00 is contrary to the 2017 Omnibus Rules on Appointments and Other Human Resource Actions (Revised July 2018) by the Civil Service Commission (CSC).



Section 13.c.7 of the Revised Civil Service Commission (CSC) Omnibus Rules on Appointment and Other Human Resource Actions (ORAOHRA), circularized through Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 14, s. 2018 dated August 30, 2018 provides that designees cannot be granted the salaries of the position they are being designated to. However, allowances that go with the performance of the functions such as RATA (Representation and Transportation Allowance) or EME (Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses) may be granted as provided under the provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) or appropriation ordinance of the respective local sanggunian; provided, that the grant of the same is specifically stated in the designation order. [Emphasis ours]



In CY 2020, Dr. Baldomero J. Bicaldo, Jr. designated Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA) and Ms. Joelence C. Leynes, designated VP for Administration and Finance (VPAF) who were holders of Associate Professor IV and Assistant Professor I position, respectively, were paid salary differentials equivalent to the difference between their present salaries and the 1st step of the salary grade of a permanent VP position, as follows:

In the verification of the memorandum orders issued by the College President designating the above-named VPs, it was stated that “the designation of the personnel as VPs does not require additional remuneration”.  Thus, the payment of their salary differential is contrary to the CSC MC No. 14, s. 2018.



The management stated that the payments of salary differential to designated VPs were based on Item 8 of CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2018 dated June 22, 2018 and Item 7.13.3.1 of DBM Manual of Position Classification and Compensation, Chapter 7 quoted as follows:



--	Item 8 of CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2018 dated June 22, 2018 



 Faculty members who are designated as VPs shall be entitled to the difference between their present salaries and the 1st step of the salary grade of a permanent VP Position as shown in the first section of this document.



--	DBM Manual of Position Classification and Compensation, Chapter 7, Item 7.13.3.1 



Faculty and non-faculty members who are designated as VPs shall be entitled to the difference between their present salaries and the 1st step of the salary grade of the VP positions corresponding to the level of the SUCs concerned. Said salary differential shall form part of their actual salaries as designated VPs. The year-end benefits (YEB) and retirement and life insurance premiums (RLIP) shall be adjusted accordingly during their period of designations.



The above-cited provisions are inconsistent with the provisions of the Revised CSC Omnibus Rules on Appointment and Other Human Resource Actions (ORAOHRA), circularized through Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 14, s. 2018 dated August 30, 2018.



It should be emphasized that the CSC, as per Section 3, Article IX-B of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, has the mandate to establish a career service and adopt measures to promote morale, efficiency, integrity, responsiveness, progressiveness and courtesy in the civil service. x x x” and that Section 26, Chapter 5, Title I (A), Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987 states that “all personnel actions shall be in accordance with such rules, standards and regulations as may be promulgated by the Commission. Thus, the payment of salary differential to two designated VPs is not allowed in audit.





b)	  RATA totaling P564,500.00  was paid to 19 designated officials who are not among those entitled to the said allowance under Section 4.5 of DBM National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 548 dated May 15, 2013 and Chapter 7, Section 7.13.2 of NBC No. 461



Post-audit of disbursement vouchers show that the College paid RATA totaling P1,930,800.00 to 51 designated College Officials in CY 2020.



Among those entitled to receive RATA under Section 4.5 of DBM National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 548 dated May 15, 2013 are Designated Vice-Presidents, Deans of Colleges, Directors of Centers/Institutes/Services and Satellite Campuses duly authorized by law, and Department Heads in SUCs consistent with NBC No. 404, s. 1989.



In relation to the above-cited provisions of NBC No. 548, Section 4.0 of NBC No. 404, s. 1989 provides that the following personnel/officials of State Universities and Colleges are hereby entitled to receive the monthly commutable transportation and representation allowances equivalent to chiefs of divisions:



a)	Designated head of an approved Research Function, xxx;

b)	Designated head of authorized Extension Service, xxx;

c)	Designated head of Auxiliary Services, xxx;

d)	Designated head of each satellite campus/branch/center/institute, duly mandated by law, xxx; and 

e)	Designated head of Administrative and Financial Services.



Further, Chapter 7, Section 7.13.2 of NBC No. 461 provides that RATA based on rank equivalence at the rates provided in the annual General Appropriations Act (GAA) are authorized to be paid to faculty members designated as follows:



a)	Designated Vice-Presidents;

b)	Designated Dean of the Graduate School, xxx;

c)	Designated Dean of Colleges, xxx;

d)	Designated Director of Research Services, xxx;

e)	Designated Director of Extension Services, xxx;

The Management stated, among others, that RATA were paid to 51 designated key officials per NBC No. 548 and 461 in the total amount of P1,930,800.00 to cover the expenses incurred in the discharge of their duties and responsibilities.



However, RATA paid to 19 officials listed in the table above in the total amount of P564,500.00 has no legal basis.  



 

c)	  Payment of honoraria to College Board of Trustees (BOT) and BOT Finance Committee totaling P159,515.00 is contrary to Section 3 (c) of RA 8292 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2003-6 dated September 29, 2003.



Section 3 (c) of RA 8292 provides that the members of the BOR/BOT shall serve without compensation, but they shall be reimbursed for necessary expense incurred in their attendance of meetings of the Board or in connection with their official business authorities by resolution of the Board.  



DBM Budget Circular No. 2003-6 dated September 29, 2003 also provides that the Chairperson shall be entitled to receive per diems in an  amount equivalent to 25% of the monthly RATA of the SUC President for every meeting actually attended but not to exceed four (4) paid meetings in a month, while the Members are entitled to receive per diems in amount equivalent to 25% of the monthly RATA of the SUC Vice-President for every meeting actually attended but not to exceed four (4) paid meetings in a month and that these amounts shall be charged against the amount appropriated for the purpose in the General Appropriations Act and any deficiency shall be charged against savings. [Emphasis ours]



Audit of disbursement vouchers and journals for CY 2020 showed that the College paid honoraria to the Board of Trustees (BOT) and BOT Finance Committee amounting to P159,515.00 for attending various meetings to discuss and approve resolutions on the operations of the College in CY 2020, as summarized in the table below:.

The grant of honoraria instead of per diem to the BOT and BOT Finance Committee is not in accordance with Section 3 (c) of RA No. 8292. 



Management claimed that the amount of honoraria paid to the BOT and the BOT Finance Committee were the equivalent per diems authorized under NBC No. 2003-6. However, per verification, the honoraria paid was higher by P34,965.00 compared to the amount of per diem authorized under DBM Budget Circular that should have been paid,  as presented in Annex B. 





We recommended that Management:



a)	stop the payment of salary differential, RATA and honoraria of the BOT/Finance Committee Members out of the STF;



b)	strictly observe the rules and regulations on the use of STF as provided under CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, series of 2011, Section 4(3) of PD No. 1445, RA No. 8292, COA Circular No. 2000-002, 2017 ORAOHRA (Revised July 2018), DBM National Budget Circular No. 548, DBM NBC No. 404, s. 1989, DBM NBC No. 461 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2003-6 and ensure that future payments of the above-mentioned benefits are in compliance with the said laws, rules and regulations;



c)	cause the refund of the paid salary differentials, RATA and honoraria without valid/legal basis and revert the  amount to the STF;



d)	stop the payment of salary differential to designated College Vice-Presidents as per Section 13 (c) (7) of CSC Memorandum Circular No. 14, series of 2018 dated August 30, 2018, or the 2017 Omnibus Rules on Appointments and other Human Resource Actions (ORAOHRA), Revised July 2018; 



e)	make representation with the DBM to provide funds for the payments RATA to authorized College Officials per Section 4.5 of DBM National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 548 dated May 15, 2013, Section 4.0 of NBC No. 404, s. 1989 and Chapter 7, Section 7.13.2 of NBC No. 461 and per diems of the Chairperson and Members of the BOT and Finance Committee as per DBM Budget Circular No. 2003-6 dated September 29, 2003 in the General Appropriations Act in the ensuing year and onwards; and



f)	stop the practice of paying honoraria to the Members of the BOT, instead provide them per diem and reimbursement of the necessary expenses incurred in attending Board meetings pursuant to DBM Budget Circular No. 2003-6 dated September 29, 2003.



Salary Differential of Vice-Presidents 



The Management commented that in the organization structure of State Universities and Colleges (SUCs), Vice-Presidents (VPs) are positioned to perform administrative and supervisory roles in the major mandated functions of the Institution. However, SUCs lack plantilla position for VPs. MinSCAT just like other SUCs, have its Board of Trustees who appoint qualified personnel as vice presidents upon recommendation of the President to perform the duties and responsibilities of permanent VP positions; extending the opportunity for undertaking and executive responsibilities to qualified personnel with inclination to such nature of work thereby giving the Board flexibility for the development of promising SUC personnel for higher responsibilities (Item 7 of SUC Levelling Benefits in CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, Series of 2018).



They also informed that the sourcing of the funds in the STF was based on the following:



--	Items 6.0 and 10.0 of DBM and CHED Joint Circular (JC) No. 1, s. 2003 dated May 29, 2003 which states that no new plantilla position of VP shall be created. Instead, designation may be made in accordance with the classification of the SUCs as evaluated under this instrument and that no release shall be made for the initial implementation of this circular. It is understood that any amount needed shall be sourced from the available savings or income of the SUC concerned. 

--	Item 3.0 of DBM and CHED JC No. 1-B, s. 2007 dated June 21, 2007 which states that the Incremental Personal Services, as a result of SUC Leveling, will be charge against the income/savings of the respective SUCs subject to usual accounting and auditing rules and regulations. 



We acknowledged the comments of the Management and the bases that they have cited, however, we stand by our position that all personnel actions shall be in accordance with such rules, standards and regulations as may be promulgated by the Civil Service Commission as per Section 26, Chapter 5, Title I (A), Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987, thus, the provisions of Section 13.c.7 of the Revised Civil Service Commission (CSC) Omnibus Rules on Appointment and Other Human Resource Actions (ORAOHRA), circularized through Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 14, s. 2018 dated August 30, 2018 which provides that designees cannot be granted the salaries of the position they are being designated to should have been observed by the College. In addition, Section 2.1.4 of COA Circular No. 2000-002 dated April 4, 2000 provides that “In no case shall the STF be used for the payment of salaries and the creation of new position” while G.R. No. 211999 promulgated on August 20, 2019 also limits the use of STF for instruction, research or extension. With these, the payments of salary differential to designated VPs out of the STF may be subject to refund for violating the cited regulations. 



RATA of designated Officials



Management commented that due to the absence of plantilla positions, faculty members and employees who have appropriate education, training, experience and expertise were designated as VPs, Directors, Department/Unit Heads to perform the mandated functions, normal operations and development endeavors of the College and due to exigencies of service, these designated employees work beyond the number of hours than their total faculty workload and even render overtime services/extra work beyond office hours and during weekends and holidays to complete and finish their task. To support and reinforce efficiency, ingenuity, higher level of performance and boost morale of and cover the expenses incurred in the discharge of the duties and responsibilities of these designated employees, RATA were given. 



In addition, they also commented that recommendation for possible amendments to NBC No. 404, s. 1989 will be brought to higher ups, like DBM and CHED, since there are numerous reforms already applied on the SUC structure as well as the scope of its function. These changes entail additional manpower with appropriate competence and additional number of key persons in order to render the structure functional. 



We noted the comments provided by Management, but we would like to point out that Section 13.1.1 of DBM National Budget Circular No. 548 dated May 15, 2013 states that the amount required for the grant of commutable or reimbursable RATA to the incumbents or OICs of regular positions and to designated officials in SUCs shall be charged to the respective agency appropriations/budgets for the purpose. In case of deficiencies, the same shall be charged against agency savings. Also, Section 4.5 of DBM National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 548 dated May 15, 2013 and Chapter 7, Section 7.13.2 of NBC No. 461 provides the list of designated officials entitled to RATA. Hence, with these, RATA of designated officials should have been charged against the GAA and not in STF and officials not among those authorized under NBC Nos. 548 and 461 should not have been granted RATA.



Honoraria of College BOT and BOT Finance Committee



Management commented that payment of honoraria to BOT out of the STF was based on Section 18 of CMO No. 20, s. 2011 which provides, among others, the provision of common fund of SUC on which the expenditures considered as SUC common administrative cost shall be paid, such as: cost of holding BOR/T meetings; travel expenses of the BOR/T members; honoraria and other incentives of the BOR/T and that the honoraria given are determined based on the rates provided in NBC No. 2003-6 though instead of “per diem” named “honoraria”.



We maintained our position that since it was partly discussed in G.R. No. 211999, promulgated on August 20, 2019 that “Meetings of the State University and Colleges governing boards cannot be considered as instruction, research, extension, or any other similar project or program” and that DBM Budget Circular No. 2003-6 dated September 29, 2009 provides that, x x x amounts of per diems shall be charged against the amount appropriated for the purpose in the General Appropriations Act and any deficiency shall be charged against savings, these should have not been sourced from the STF. In addition, as per re-computation, payments were higher by P34,965.00 compared to the amount of per diem authorized under DBM Budget Circular that should have been paid.







Lapses in the implementation of GAA funded infrastructure projects



5)	Technical specifications of seven (7) electric elevators with a total cost of P12,600,000.00 which is part of the Renovation/ Improvement/ Upgrading of Academic Buildings and Provision of Facilities for Persons with Disabilities (PWD) project were not indicated in the bidding documents contrary to Sections 12.1, 17.2 and 18 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184, thus, conformity and compliance needs of the College was not properly evaluated and assured.  



Section 17.2 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184 provides that the bidding documents shall be prepared by the procuring entity following the standard forms and manuals prescribed by the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) and that the bidding documents shall include the following, among others, technical specifications and other terms in the bidding documents which shall reflect the necessary specifications required to meet the needs of the procuring entity in clear and unambiguous terms. [Emphasis ours]



In addition, Section 18 of the same RIRR provides that specifications for the procurement of goods shall be based on relevant characteristics, functionality and/or performance requirements. Reference to brand names shall not be the same make and brand, and to maintain the performance, functionality and useful life of the equipment. This Section shall also apply to the goods component of Infrastructure Projects and Consulting Services.



Further, Section 12.1 of the same RIRR provides the different functions of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC), which includes among others the creation of Technical Working Group (TWG) from a pool of technical, financial and/or legal experts to assist them in the (a) review of the technical specifications, scope of works and terms of reference; (b) review of bidding documents; (c) shortlisting of consultants; (d) eligibility screening; (e) evaluation of bids; (f) post-qualifications; and (g) resolution of request for reconsideration.



Review of the contract and its supporting documents for the Renovation/ Improvement/ Upgrading of Academic Buildings and Provisions of Facilities for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) project costing P14,948,525.00 show that the technical specifications of seven (7) electric elevators with a total cost of P12,600,000.00 for various buildings in three Campuses included in the project cost were not provided in the bidding documents contrary to the above- cited provisions of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184,  thus the necessary specifications required to meet the needs of the College and the intended beneficiaries/users was not assured. Proper evaluation of the function, performance and design standards of the elevators within that range of the approved ABC and proper inspection of delivered/installed equipment cannot be undertaken without the required technical specifications.    



In an inquiry with Engr. Benjamin J. Mataya, Jr., former Director for Auxiliary who signed in the “Prepared by” portion of the program of works, he justified that he did not prepare the program of works although he was the signatory, thus he cannot tell why the technical specifications of the electric elevators were not provided in the bidding documents. In addition, inquiry with the former BAC Chairperson, Ms. Joelene C. Leynes, revealed that the new sets of College Key Officials who assumed their post in CY 2018 already revised the program of works prepared by the former Officials, however they overlooked the absence of technical specifications of the electric elevators. 



The failure of the concerned Officials who prepared the program of works, as well as of the BAC and TWG to notice the absence of the technical specifications in the bidding documents only shows that there was no proper review and evaluation made.  Likewise, the necessary specifications required to meet the needs of the College and the intended beneficiaries/users was not assured.





We recommended that the College President:



a)	require the BAC and other concerned personnel to submit the detailed specifications of the seven electric elevators in support of the total cost of P12,600,000.00; and 



b)	 instruct the members of the BAC to ensure that the College abides by the standards set forth in the 2016 RIRR of RA 9184 including the proper review of the technical specifications, scope of works, terms of references and bidding documents, among others, prior to the advertisement/posting of procurement opportunities. 



The Management commented that the members of the BAC were instructed during a special meeting to address and implement our recommendation in the future procurement activities and explained that the observed deficiencies in the review of technical specifications, scope of works, terms of references and bidding documents may have been the outcome of hurried preparation/revision of procurement documents right after the advent of the new administration in 2018 when the requirement for early procurement activities were required by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and that the inadvertent deficiencies were not immediately addressed until it became one of the findings.





6)	Five (5) infrastructure projects were reported at only 13.28 to 67.73 percent completed as of the latest progress report despite the expiration of contract period and approved time extension due to the inability of the College to monitor and evaluate the performance of the contractors and devise calibrated measures in response to delays in the implementation, contrary to Item 12.1, Annex E of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 and Item 4.2 of GPPB Circular No. 03-2019 dated March 8, 2019. 



Item 12.1, Annex E of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of RA No. 9184 provides that all procuring entities implementing government infrastructure projects are mandated to evaluate the performance of their contractors using the NEDA-Approved Contractors Performance Evaluation System (CPES) Guidelines for the type of project being implemented. These guidelines cover all infrastructure projects awarded by the government regardless of contract amount and funding source. CPES evaluation shall be done during construction and upon completion of each government project. To ensure continuous implementation of CPES, all Procuring Entities concerned are required to include in their Projects’ Engineering and Administrative Overhead Cost the budget for the implementation of CPES pursuant to NEDA Board Resolution No. 18 (s. 2002).



In relation to the above provision of Annex E of the RIRR of RA No. 9184, Item 4.2 of the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Circular No. 03-2019 dated March 8, 2019 provides the calibrated actions in response to delays in the implementation of infrastructure projects that the College should have observed to ensure the timely implementation of those infrastructure projects and effectively manage the performance of the concerned contractors, which includes the following:



--	Negative Slippage of 5%



The contractor shall be given a warning and be required to:



a)	Submit a detailed “catch-up” program every two weeks in order to eliminate the slippage and to restore the project to its original schedule;

b)	Accelerate work and identify specific physical targets to be accomplished over a  definite period of time; and 

c)	Provide additional input resources such as the following: money, manpower, materials, equipment, and management, which shall be mobilized for this action. 



The implementing unit shall exercise closer supervision and meet the contractor every other week to evaluate the progress of work and resolve any problems and bottlenecks.



--	Negative slippage of ten percent (10%) –



The contractor shall be issued a final warning and be required to come-up with a revised detailed “catch-up” program with weekly physical targets together with the required additional input resources.



The implementing unit shall intensify on-site supervision and evaluation of the project performance to at least once a week and prepare contingency plans for a possible termination of the contract or take-over of the work by administration or contract.



--	Negative slippage of fifteen percent (15%) –



The contractor shall be issued a final warning and be required to come-up with a revised detailed “catch-up” program with weekly physical targets together with the required additional input resources.



The implementing unit shall intensify on-site supervision and evaluation of the project performance to at least once a week and prepare contingency plans for a possible termination of the contract or take-over of the work by administration or contract.

Post- audit of disbursement vouchers and supporting documents of infrastructure projects revealed that five infrastructure projects with a total contract costs of P81,750,630.85 and with expired contract time were only 13.28 to 67.73percent complete  or equivalent to a total amount of P35,808,004.85  based on the latest paid work accomplishment, as presented in Annex C.

	

Verification of documents such as contracts, notices to proceed, certification/inspection reports of the Inspectorate Team, submitted copies of approved time extensions revealed that the contract duration of the above- listed projects have already expired.  Based on the accomplishment reports attached to the latest payments, the projects were only 13.28 to 67.73 percent accomplished as of December 31, 2020. For further verification, the Audit Team conducted ocular inspections on January 26, 28 and 29, 2021, together with agency personnel and confirmed that the above-listed projects were really not yet completed.



In addition, it was also noted that the College concerned personnel failed to monitor and evaluate the performance of the contractors and to implement calibrated measures in response to delays in the implementation such as giving warnings/final warnings to concerned contractors and requiring them to: (a) submit detailed catch-up program; (b) to accelerate their works; and (c) to provide additional inputs to ensure the timely implementation of the project as well as the intensification of on-site supervision and evaluation of the project performance to at least once a week and the preparation of contingency plans for a possible termination of contract or take-over of the work by administration or contract as per Item 12.1, Annex E of the 2016 RIRR of RA 9184 and Item 4.2 of GPPB Circular No. 03-2019 dated March 8, 2019. 



Inquiry with the incumbent Director for Auxiliary, Inspectorate Team and other concerned personnel revealed that the contractors of the five unfinished projects claimed that COVID-19 pandemic affected their working schedules and deliveries of construction materials, thus they requested for time extensions. They also informed that monitoring and evaluation of contractors and implementation of calibrated measures in response to delays in the project implementation were not conducted and implemented due to confusion on the proper person responsible when the Engineer in charge to supervise the projects of the College resigned from his post last year.  





We recommended that Management instruct the present Director for Auxiliary, Inspectorate Team and Engineer to:



a)	furnish the Audit Team with copies of duly approved additional time extensions granted to the concerned contractors supported with documents such as Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) Resolutions for appropriate adjustments of the target date of completions of the above projects; and 



b)	evaluate the performance of contractors and implement calibrated measures in response to delays in implementation as per Item 12.1, Annex E of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184 and Item 4.2 of GPPB Circular No. 03-2019 dated March 8, 2019.



The Management commented that they have already advised the concerned contractors on the delay in completion of these projects, however, continued implementation of community lockdowns due to COVID-19 pandemic prohibits the employment of additional workforce and affected the deliveries of construction materials. 





7)	Liquidated damages imposed to contractors of six projects were understated by P273,330.52 due to  erroneous  computation on the number of days delayed, inconsistent with Annex A of GPPB Resolution No. 02-2020 dated February 27, 2020, to the prejudice of the College.



Annex A of GPPB Resolution No. 02-2020 dated February 27, 2020 provides the harmonized rules on imposition of liquidated damages provided under Annexes D and E of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184, which includes, among others:



a)	Once the contract duration expires, including any time extension duly granted, and the contractor refuses or fails to satisfactorily complete the work, the Procuring Entity shall impose upon the contractor in default liquidated damages. Liquidated damages is an amount equal to at least one tenth (1/10) of one (1) percent of the cost of the unperformed portion of the works for every day of delay; and



b)	To be entitled to such liquidated damages, the Procuring Entity does not have to prove that it has incurred actual damages. Such amount shall be deducted from any money due or which may become due the contractor under the contract or collect such liquidated damages from the retention money or other securities posted by the contractor, or a combination thereof, whichever is convenient to the Procuring Entity.



In our post- audit of the disbursement vouchers for payments of progress billings of the concerned contractors of six projects with certificate of completion, we noted that the College deducted a total amount of P909,652.97 as liquidated damages in the final payments, as follows:

P909,652.97

 

Review and verification of relevant documents attached to the DVs such as contract agreements, notices to proceed and duly approved time extensions showed that the number of days delayed computed by the Inspectorate Team was lower by two to 68 days.  On the basis of Annex A of GPPB Resolution No. 02-202 dated February 27, 2020 and the re-computation of the Audit Team, the total liquidated damages of P1,182,983.49 should have been deducted instead of P909,652.97, thus the overpayment of P273,330.52 as shown in Annex D.





We recommended that Management instruct the Accountant and other concerned personnel to deduct the uncollected liquidated damages totaling P273,330.52 from any money  due to the concerned contractor/s or from the retention money or other securities posted by the contractor, or a combination thereof, whichever is convenient to them as per Annex A of GPPB Resolution No. 02-2020 dated February 27, 2020.



The Management is amenable with our recommendations and committed to collect from the concerned contractors the uncollected liquidated damages totaling P273,330.52.





8)	The contract costs of six projects totaling P103,565,925.85 were found higher than the COA cost estimates of P79,035,284.01  by P24,530,641.84, as computed per Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Department Order (DO) No. 197 dated October 7, 2016, thus considered excessive expenditures defined under Section 5.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, to the prejudice of the government.



Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Department Order (DO) No. 197 dated October 7, 2016 provides the revised guidelines in the preparation of Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC).



Section 5.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 provides that excessive expenditure signifies unreasonable expense or expenses incurred at an immoderate quantity and exorbitant price. It also includes expenses which exceed what is usual or proper, as well as expenses which are unreasonably high and beyond just measure or amount. It also includes expenses in excess of reasonable limits. 



The Audit Team requested the assistance of the COA RO IV-B Regional Technical Services (RTS) for the technical evaluation of the above- listed infrastructure projects implemented by the College for CY 2019 to determine the reasonableness of the Approved Budget for the Contracts (ABCs) and the contract costs.   Results of the technical review of six projects disclosed that the contract amounts of P103,565,925.85 were found higher by P24,530,641.84 compared to the COA cost estimates of P79,035,284.01 per Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Department Order (DO) No. 197 dated October 7, 2016 as presented in the following table:

We recommended that Management: 



a)	submit the lacking documents such as the appropriate plans and complete details/specification of projects and work items, respectively, as enumerated in the table above to avoid suspension in audit of the payments for the projects Renovation/Improvement/Upgrading of Academic Buildings and Provision of Facilities for Persons with Disabilities (PWD), and Renovation/Improvement/Upgrading of Multi-Purpose Gymnasium and Student Activity Center, including ventilation, both located in Victoria Campus; and 



b)	require the Accountant and other concerned personnel to deduct from the amounts due to concerned contractors the cost deficiencies in four other projects in the above table totaling P488,403.21 or institute appropriate action to compel them to pay the amount, as the case may be. 



The Management commented that the observed deficiencies may have been the outcome of hurried preparation/revision of procurement documents right after the advent of the new administration in 2018 when the requirement for early procurement activities were required by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and that the inadvertent deficiencies were not immediately addressed until it became one of the findings. They also commented that it has been ensured during their coordination with the contractors that the quantity and quality of items conformed to the costing in the approved POW and BOQ. 



In addition, they also commented that in a special meeting with key officials/persons, they were instructed to fulfill their specific concerns such as for the Accountant to deduct from any amount due the concerned contractors the cost deficiencies in the total amount of P488,403.21.



We appreciated the commitment of the Management to implement our recommendations and advised them to submit the lacking documents such as the appropriate plans and complete details/specification of projects and work items for further review of the COA RO IV-B Regional Technical Services Office and to avoid suspension in audit of the payments made for the projects Renovation/Improvement/Upgrading of Academic Buildings and Provision of Facilities for Persons with Disabilities (PWD), and Renovation/Improvement/Upgrading of Multi-Purpose Gymnasium and Student Activity Center, including ventilation, both located in Victoria Campus.	





Payments not supported with complete documents



9)	The propriety and validity of payments out of Mandatory Reserve under the Special Trust Fund (STF) totaling P3,940,602.90 cannot be ascertained due to lack of supporting documents required in COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, in violation of Section 4(6) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445.



Section 4(6) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that “Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.”



COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 provides the revised guidelines and documentary requirements for common government transactions. 



On January 9, 2020, during the combined 2019 3rd and 4th Quarter regular BOT meeting held at Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Central Office located at C.P. Garcia Avenue, UP Diliman, Quezon City, the College BOT approved under Resolution No. 02, s. 2020 the use of P9,289,796.40 from Mandatory Reserve Fund to address the emergent need for repair and replacement and purchase of additional tools and equipment caused by typhoon Tisoy and the  amount of P340,500.00 for repair and replacement of classroom building, office and instructional equipment destroyed by typhoon Ursula last December 25, 2019 at Bongabong Campus.



Post-audit of Disbursement Vouchers (DVs)/payments totaling P3,940,602.90 out of the Mandatory Reserve Fund under the Special Trust Fund (STF) of the College for CY 2020 revealed that the required supporting documents under COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 were not attached, thus precluded the Audit Team to verify the validity and accuracy of the payments made. Details were presented in Annex E.





We recommended that Management direct the Accountant and other concerned personnel in the Accounting Office to i) ensure that future DVs are supported with complete documents before their submission to the Audit Team; and ii) submit the required documents enumerated in Annex E to avoid suspension in audit of the payments made.



During the exit conference, the Accountant commented that the required supporting documents were available and that they just forgot to attach them to the DVs that were submitted to the Audit Team. Nevertheless, they committed to submit the same. 





Delayed submission of financial reports, DVs and other documents



10)	Financial reports, disbursement vouchers and other documents were submitted to the Audit Team 11 to 454 days beyond the prescribed period in violation of Section 60, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, and pertinent provisions in Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and other COA rules and regulations, thus precluded the Audit Team from the conduct of timely audit and rendition of reports. 



Section 107 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 states that Xxx, all accountable officers shall render their accounts, submit their vouchers, and make deposits of money collected or held by them at such times and in such manner as shall be prescribed in the regulations of the Commission.



Section 122  of the same P.D. states among others that: (1) Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions; and (2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have complied with the requirements of the Commission. (Emphasis ours)

Records of the Audit Team show that the College Accountant, Budget Officer and other concerned personnel failed to submit the financial statements, accounting reports, records and other financial documents and supporting schedules within the period prescribed in the above-cited laws, rules and regulations, having substantial delays ranging from 11 to 454 days, as summarized below.

Delayed submission of the said financial reports and accounting records were also noted and reported in the previous audit period. 



The College Accountant explained that aside from lack of manpower and the voluminous transactions and other tasks of equal importance that their office performs such as the reproduction, sorting and filing of DVs and their supporting documents, the transition into one- fund concept/centralization of accounting units in the Main Campus and the imposition of various community lockdowns due to COVID-19 were the main factors that caused the delays in the preparation and submission of the required reports, records and supporting documents. 



The delayed submission of financial statements, accounting reports, records and other financial documents and supporting schedules to COA within the prescribed period precluded the Audit Team from performing timely review and audit of the transactions to determine the validity, accuracy and completeness of the recorded transactions.





We would like to reiterate our previous recommendations that Management:



a)	require the Accountant, Budget Officer, Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) Secretariat and concerned officers and employees to give priority in the preparation and submission of the required financial statements, accounting reports, records, other financial documents and supporting schedules and copies of contracts and its supporting documents within the prescribed period pursuant to pertinent provisions of PD 1445 and other COA Rules and Regulations; and



b)	assign additional personnel to assist the Accountant in the preparation and submission of the required financial statements, accounting reports, records and other financial documents within the prescribed period to facilitate timely verification and audit of financial transactions of the College.
