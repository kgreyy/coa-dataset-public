Atty. BENJAMIN C. ABALOS, JR. 
Chairman 

Metropolitan Manila Development Authority 

MMDA Bldg., EDSA corner Orense St. Guadalupe, Makati City    

 

Dear Chairman Abalos: 

  

Management Letter (ML) on the Audit of the 

Metropolitan Manila Development Authority 

For the Calendar Year (CY) ended December 31, 2020 
 

1. Pursuant to Section 2, Article IX-D of the Constitution of the Philippines and Section 
43 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 or the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, 

we have audited the accounts and operations of the Metropolitan Manila Development 

Authority (MMDA) for the year ended December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted with 

applicable legal and regulatory requirements and the International Standards of Supreme 

Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 

obtain a reasonable basis for our conclusion. 

2. The audit was conducted to (a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on 
management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of 

transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; 

(c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of 

implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.    
 

3. Deficiencies observed in the course of the audit were earlier communicated through 
the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda (AOM).  Due to limitations in the holding of 

gatherings during Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine (MECQ) in Metro Manila, as 

a measure in fighting against the spread of Coronavirus Disease (COVID) 19, the Summary 

of Audit Observations and Recommendations (SAOR) was issued to Management on May 26, 

2021 in lieu of the conduct of physical actual Exit Conference.  Management comments on 

the SAOR and the replies to AOMs previously issued were incorporated in this Management 

Letter, where appropriate.   
 

4. As at audit reporting date, the MMDA has not submitted to the Audit Team the year-
end financial statements, hence, we are issuing this Management Letter in lieu of the Annual 

Audit Report (AAR).

I. Introduction 
 

5. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority was created under Republic Act 
(RA) No. 7924 on March 1, 1995 based on the policy of the State to treat Metropolitan Manila 

as a special development and administrative region wherein certain basic services affecting or 

involving Metro Manila as metro-wide services are more efficiently and effectively planned, 

supervised and coordinated by a development authority as created therein, without prejudice 

to the autonomy of the affected local government units. 

 

6. Under the said Act, the MMDA shall perform planning, monitoring and coordinative 
functions, and in the process exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over the delivery 

of metro-wide services within Metro Manila without diminution of the autonomy of the local 

government units concerning purely local matters.   

 

7. Metro-wide services under the jurisdiction of the MMDA are those services which 
have metro-wide impact and transcend legal political boundaries or entail huge expenditures 

such that it would not be viable for said services to be provided by the individual local 

government units (LGUs) in the Metropolitan Manila.  These services shall include the 

following key areas: 

 

 Development Planning; 

 Transport and Traffic Management; 

 Solid Waste Disposal and Management; 

 Flood Control and Sewerage Management; 

 Urban Renewal, Zoning and Land Use Planning and Shelter Services; 

 Health Sanitation, Urban Protection and Pollution Control; and 

 Public Safety. 
 

8. The MMDA is headed by a Chairman and assisted by two (2) Undersecretaries as a 
Deputy Chairman and as a General Manager. The MMDA is composed of the following 

offices:

13. Validation made with regard to non-attainment of targets and decreased 
accomplishments during the year 2020 revealed that: 

 

 

 

 



6 
 

a) Under MFO 1: Safe and Well-Maintained Sanitary Landfill (SLF), the waste 
reduction efforts are the primary responsibility of the LGUs under RA No. 9003 or 

the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act. To ensure operational environmental 

compliance, the Solid Waste Management Office (SWMO) of the MMDA has 

conducted a total of 88 regular inspections during CY 2020.    

  

b) Under MFO 2: Traffic and Transport Management Services, the target deployment 
of traffic constables/enforcers was not achieved due to the implementation of 

skeletal workforce for the period of March to September 2020 as a precautionary 

measure to curb the spread of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Some 

of the field personnel were given other tasks by the agency or were allowed to work 

from home due to their age or medical conditions. 

 

c) Under MFO 3: Reduction of Flooding in Flood Prone Areas in Metropolitan 
Manila, the Flood Control and Sewerage Management Office (FCSMO) has made 

a request with the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and the Congress 

to revise the target for the decrease in flooded areas from 40.00 percent to 12.00 

percent stating that the target set for CY 2020 was too high and was not attainable. 

Meanwhile, the non-completion of flood control projects before the rainy season is 

mainly attributed to delayed/long procurement timeline. The FCSMO also deemed 

it necessary to change the said output indicator into completion of projects within 

contract time and requested the revision to the DBM. The FCSMO remarked that 

the first quarter of the year is allotted in the procurement process thus, FCSMO will 

only be able to mobilize its resources and start the programmed activities on the 

second quarter of the year, at its earliest. Therefore, completion of all projects 

before the rainy season may not be feasible as some have a 150-calendar day 

duration. Both of the revisions requested were reflected in the GAA for FY 2021.  

 

 

II. Detailed Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

Non-submission of the CY 2020 Financial Statements 

 

14. MMDA failed to submit its CY 2020 Financial Statements contrary to Section 41 
(2) of PD No.1445 and Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of the Government Accounting 

Manual for National Government Agencies (GAM for NGAs). 

 

15. The Financial Statements (FS) provide users with information about an entity’s 
resources and obligations at the reporting date and the flow of resources between reporting 

dates. This information is useful for users making assessments of an entity’s ability to continue 

to provide goods and services at a given level, and the level of resources that may need to be 

provided to the entity in the future so that it can continue to meet its service delivery 

obligations. 

 

 

 



7 
 

16. Relative thereto, Section 41.2 of PD No. 1445 provides that: 
 

“To carry out the purposes of this section, the chief accountant or the 

official in charge of keeping the accounts of a government agency shall 

submit to the Commission year-end trial balances and such other 

supporting or subsidiary statements as may be required by the 

Commission not later than the fourteenth day of February. xxx” 

(emphasis ours) 

 

17. Likewise, Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume 1 of GAM for NGAs requires 
Central/Head/Main Offices of all NGAs to prepare and submit year-end financial statements 

on February 14 of the following year to the COA Auditor, DBM and COA-GAS. 

 

18. Verification of records of documents received from Management revealed that as of 
audit date, the MMDA’s CY 2020 Year-end Financial Statements with corresponding CY 

2019 balances, consisting of the Statement of Financial Position, Statement of Financial 

Performance, Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity, Statement of Cash Flow, Statement 

of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amount and the Notes to Financial Statements 

comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes, were 

not submitted to COA despite several written and verbal follow-ups made. 

 

19. Consequently, the non-availability of the required financial reports hampered the 
timely and complete audit/review and evaluation of the financial transactions and account 

balances of the agency. 

 

20. We recommended that Management submit to COA the CY 2020 Financial 
Statements to enable the latter to fully execute the financial audit and render an audit 

opinion on the fairness of presentation on the MMDA’s FSs. 
 

 

Delay in the submission of the required financial reports/records and other documents subject 

for audit 

 

21. Despite prior years’ audit recommendation, the Agency has yet to comply with 
the required timely submission of financial reports/records with supporting transaction 

documents, contracts/purchase orders and notices/certificates of acceptance of deliveries 

which prevented the Audit Team from having a systematic and effective review of the 

documents with the end view of generating timely and relevant audit results. 

 

22. The following guidelines are to be observed in the submission of financial reports/ 
records and other documents:

24. It is worth-mentioning that Management has yet to properly address the following: 
 

a) the monthly submission of Trial Balance with accompanying supporting 
schedules as required in the above-cited provision of GAM and quarterly FSs; 
 

b) reports that are yet to be submitted such as Trial Balances, Bank Reconciliation 
Statements, Liquidation Reports, Report of Collection and Deposits with Official 

Receipts and Disbursement Vouchers; 

 

c) submission of supporting documents for adjusting and closing entry vouchers 
made during the year; and 

 

d) unsubmitted/unaccounted Disbursement Vouchers, Purchase Orders, Notice of 
Delivery and Contracts as shown in the following table:

Particulars No. of items Period Covered 

Contracts 47 2020 

Purchase Order 106 2018-2020 

Notice of Delivery 176 2018-2020 

 

25. Inquiry from Accounting personnel concerned disclosed that financial reports and 
other financial documents were not submitted on time due to lack of manpower to prepare the 

said reports and documents. The personnel also explained that disbursement vouchers, 

payrolls and other financial documents took some time to be submitted to them by the 

Treasury and Administrative Division hence; it likewise delayed their submission of reports 

and documents which will still be subjected for review/analysis and for encoding in e-NGAS. 



10 
 

Moreover, there are still unsubmitted vouchers as of this report as the checks were not yet 

claimed by the payees.  

 

26. A letter dated July 6, 2020 was issued by the Audit Team and reiterated on October 
14, 2020 to inquire on the status and to furnish the Supply Division the list of 

unsubmitted/unaccounted purchase orders and notices of deliveries for the years 2018-2019.   

According to Management, some of the transactions covered by those documents were 

cancelled thus, no longer submitted to the audit team. Despite prior efforts in retrieving, 

however, there are still documents that remain unsubmitted/unaccounted for and this is being 

continuously monitored by the Audit Team.  

 

27. Inquiry revealed that notices of deliveries were submitted late to the Audit Team due 
to delayed inspection and acceptance of delivered items by the Supply Division which result 

in the delay in the processing of documents specifically those items that are delivered in the 

field offices. The implementation of the skeletal workforce also affected the timely movement 

of documents among offices of the agency. As of report date, the unsubmitted/unaccounted 

purchase orders, notice of deliveries and contracts are still being collated by their Office. 

 

28. The delayed or non-submission of the financial reports/records with supporting 
transaction documents, contracts/purchase orders and notices/certificates of acceptance of 

deliveries prevented the Audit Team from having a systematic and effective review of the 

documents with the end view of generating timely and relevant audit results. 

 

29. We reiterated the previous recommendation that Management require all 
concerned agency officials/personnel to strictly comply with the pertinent rules and 

regulations on the timely submission of financial reports/records and copies of all

Delayed Implementation of Flood Control Projects by the Flood Control Sewerage 

Management Office – P1.279 billion 

 

30. Of the 94 programmed flood control projects for CY 2020, 67 projects with a total 
cost of P835,244,000.00 were not completed as at year-end due to delays in the conduct 

of procurement activities and/or pending release of Special Allotment Release Order 

(SARO) from the Department of Budget and Management. Moreover, 41 projects 

totaling P444,213,624.54 were not completed/implemented within the specific contract 

time due to inadequate planning and lack of coordination with the concerned LGUs, 

communities, the DPWH and other government agencies.  Furthermore, the Output 

Indicator for 100% projects completed prior to on-set of rainy season has not been fully 

attained as 26 flood control projects costing P234,471,025.62 were completed during the 

rainy seasons of 3rd and 4th quarters of CY 2020. All of these hindered the MMDA in 

attaining its important objective to mitigate flooding in the Metropolis.

31. Flood control and sewerage management is one of the mandates of the MMDA 
covering the formulation and implementation of policies, standards, programs and projects for 

an integrated flood control, drainage and sewerage system. 

 

32. Sections 20 and 60 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 or the GAA of FY 
2020, provides the guidelines on early procurement activities and cash based budgeting 

system, respectively. 

 

33. Meanwhile, Sections 37.1.2, 32.4 and 38.2 of the Revised Implementing Rules and 
Regulations (RIRR) of RA No. 9184 presents the timelines to be observed in the conduct of 

procurement activities. 

 

34. The following are the noted significant gaps in the implementation of the MMDA’s 
flood control projects: 

 

a) Non-completion of 67 out of 94 programmed flood control projects for CY 2020 
due to incurrence of delays in the conduct of procurement activities and pending 

release of SARO from DBM – P835.244 million  

 

35.  For CY 2020, a total of P1,637,428,000.00 was budgeted for FCSMO 
Program/Activity broken as follows:

36. The appropriations for Capital Outlay-Infrastructure Projects totaling 
P1,072,277,000.00 covers 94 flood control projects/structures set to be completed in CY 2020. 

Of these, 27 projects have been completed (28.72 percent), 33 are on-going (35.11 percent), 

nine (9) have not been yet started (9.57 percent), and 25 are for perfection of contracts (26.60 

percent) as of December 31, 2020.  These are summarized in Table 8.

37. Review of the MMDA’s Procurement Monitoring Report (PMR) for CY 2020 
disclosed significant gaps in the period of action on specific procurement activities, 

particularly on the issuance of Notice of Award (NOA), conduct of bid evaluation, and Pre-

Procurement Conference to the issuance of Notice to Proceed (NTP). Summary is shown as 

follows:

Annex C 

157 to 278 days 156 days 1 to 122 days 24 

 

38. Discussion with the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) members disclosed that the 
delay in the conduct of pre-procurement activities to issuance of the NTP ranging from one 

(1) to 122 days, mentioned above, was due to limited movement of MMDA personnel/officials 

resulting from alternative work arrangement implemented by the Authority in relation to 

COVID-19 pandemic quarantine restriction which ultimately affected the procurement 

activities. Further, most of the signatories in the procurement activities are also member of the 

Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for COVID-19. 

 

39. It is worth mentioning that the BAC had already started the procurement process as 
early as the 4th quarter of CY 2019 for some of the proposed Infrastructure Projects for CY 

2020. However, it was noted that the procurement process for 43 proposed flood control 

projects with a total cost of P433,890,896.79 were awarded only on the 2nd semester of CY 

2020. Section 20 of RA No. 11465 provides that government agencies are authorized to 

expedite the implementation of their procurement activities. Thus, agencies can undertake 

procurement activities, short of award, prior to the approval of GAA, and receipt of allotments 

issued by DBM. 

 

40. Furthermore, there are 25 flood control projects with a budget amount of 
P386,359,000.00 still subject for perfection of contracts. The Head of Budget Division 

informed the Audit Team that they are still waiting for the release of SARO from DBM since 

according to the Office of the Executive Secretary it is subject for re-evaluation. Despite 

several written and verbal follow-ups made by them, no release was yet made by DBM for 

the said projects. 

 

41. It is understandable that the procurement activities were affected due to COVID-19 
pandemic, but the succeeding Annual Procurement Plans (APPs) must be assessed to ensure 

that the agency’s commitment for an efficient and economic procurement process will be 

attained. Due to the foregoing, the socio/economic benefits that could be derived from the 

unimplemented/uncompleted projects were not attained during the year. 

 



13 
 

42. We recommended and Management agreed to require the BAC to faithfully 
comply with the procurement timelines/period prescribed under Sections 37.1.2, 32.4 

and 38.2 and Annex C of RA No. 9184 and its RIRR and for the Budget Division to 

continue follow up the release of SARO from DBM. 
 

b) Non-completion of 41 programmed flood control projects within the specific 
contract time nor implemented due to inadequate planning and lack of 

coordination mechanism with concerned LGUs, communities, DPWH and other 

government agencies – P444.213 million 

 

43. The primary consideration of the government for entering into a contract is the timely 
completion of the infrastructure projects so that the intended benefits may be achieved. 

Consequently, the contracting parties are bound to adhere faithfully to agreed terms and 

conditions of the contract.  

 

44. The RIRR of RA No. 9184 requires the conduct of detailed engineering for the 
procurement of infrastructure projects. 

 

45. In the evaluation of the status of flood control projects being implemented by the 
FCSMO for CY 2020, it was noted that 20 flood control projects amounting to 

P217,770,976.94 were not finished within the specific contract time or required completion 

date. The number of delays ranges from seven (7) days up to 185 days as of December 31, 

2020. Further evaluation disclosed that there were 21 flood control projects funded under CYs 

2019 and 2018 GAAs amounting to P226,442,647.60 which remain uncompleted as of year-

end. Summary of uncompleted projects as follows:

2018 5 40,465,279.57 

Total 41 444,213,624.54 

 

46. Perusal of the submitted MMDA’s Publicized Government Projects / Programs / 
Activities (GPPAs) Report as of December 31, 2020 revealed significant delays in the 

implementation of the flood control projects due to issuance of Suspension Orders for the 

following reasons: 

 

 late/pending issuance of clearance from LGUs, barangays, community and 
other concerned agencies; 

 delayed construction works due to community quarantine restrictions brought 
by COVID-19 pandemic; 

 typhoon or unfavorable weather condition; 

 removal of obstructions within the vicinity of the project; and 

 issuance of Change Order as a result of change of design from gravity wall 
(riprap) to retaining wall.   



14 
 

47. Moreover, there were seven (7) flood control projects delayed due to late/pending 
issuance of permit from LGU/barangay to wit:

48. Generally, the causes of delay may have been outside of control of MMDA such as, 
typhoon/unfavorable weather condition and imposition of lockdown due to COVID-19 

pandemic for which a time extension may be approved by the Agency. However, the issues   

needing coordination with the LGUs, DPWH and other concerned agencies are unintentional 

but procedural and consequential which affect the timely completion of the projects. 

 

49. As of audit date, it is worth mentioning that the FCSMO had started its coordination 
with DPWH and LGUs of Metro Manila for CY 2020 proposed flood control projects through 

a memorandum/letter dated November 12, 2019 informing them of the National Expenditure 

Program (NEP) of MMDA FCSMO for CY 2020. However, there are still flood control 

projects with delayed implementation due to lack of coordination resulting in the late/pending 

issuance of permits, among others. 

 

50. The foregoing conditions manifested inadequacy of strategies to implement planned 
activities for which funding/budget was approved for; and lack of comprehensive and 

technical evaluation undertaken to establish the viability of the projects thus, depriving the 

target communities of the immediate benefit/use of flood control projects. 

 

 



15 
 

51. We recommended and Management agreed through the FCSMO to: 
 

a) ensure that cause/s or factors of delay controllable by the agency are duly 
considered and properly addressed prior to project implementation; 

 

b) improve full coordination with other government agencies, among others, 
the DPWH and the LGUs, as well as the community, for a more effective and 

synchronized planning of programs and projects;  

 

c) secure an explanation as to the reasons/causes of delayed/pending issuance 
of clearance from LGU/barangay; and 

 

d) closely monitor the status/progress of projects to ascertain that the 
strategies adopted are responsive to fast track the implementation of the 

projects. 
 

c) Non-attainment of the Output Indicator for 100% projects completed prior to on-
set of rainy season as 26 flood control projects were completed during rainy 

seasons of 3rd and 4th quarters of CY 2020 – P234.471 million  

 

52. The National Capital Region has always been plagued with perennial flooding due to 
its deltaic nature with some areas below sea level. Major factor that aggravates and triggers 

the flooding specially in the low-lying areas in Metro Manila is caused by long duration of 

rainfall highly intensified by typhoons. Therewith, the necessity to effect program for 

prevention and protection should be timely. 

 

53. The GAA for FY 2020 provided the following Output Indicators for the Organizational 
Outcome vis-à-vis Accomplishments: 

 
Table 12. FCSMO’s Output Indicators of its Organizational Outcome

16 
 

54. The above table shows that one of the Output Indicators for the MFO of FCSMO for 
CY 2020 is 100 percent of projects completed prior to on-set of rainy seasons.   

 

55. Verification showed that of the 94 flood control projects for CY 2020, only 28.72 
percent or 27 projects with a total project cost of P234,471,025.62 were completed during the 

year and of the 27 completed flood control projects, 26 were completed in the 3rd and 4th 

quarters of CY 2020, thereby defeating the intent of mitigating or preventing the impact of 

heavy rains to the public at large to which these projects could easily serve their purposes. 

 

56. The Director of FCSMO informed the Audit Team that the delayed/long procurement 
timeline was mainly attributed to the delayed completion of flood control projects during rainy 

season.  

 

57. We recommended and Management agreed through the FCSMO to expedite the 
implementation of procurement activities for the timely prosecution and completion of 

its flood control projects wherein procurement activities should be done as early as the 

first quarter to ensure completion of flood control projects before the onset of the rainy 

seasons which normally starts in the month of June and onwards. 
 

 

 Delayed/Non-Completion of Infrastructure Projects   – P1.885 billion  

   

58. Delays in the procurement activities due to non-observance of the timelines 
indicated in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP) resulted in the delayed implementation 

of ten (10) projects under Traffic Engineering Center (TEC), Metrobase and Health and 

Environmental Protection Office (HEPO) with a total cost of P681,769,627.52. 

Moreover, nine (9) projects with an aggregate contract cost of P1,203,336,567.11 were 

not completed within the specific contract time due to: (a) inadequate planning and 

absence of coordination with the concerned LGUs, communities and other agencies; and 

(b) unsatisfactory performance of the contractor. 

 

a) Delays in the conduct of procurement activities due to non-observance of the 
procurement timelines indicated in the APP   –  P681.770 million 

 

59. Transport and Traffic Management is one of the mandates of the MMDA.  This 
mandate includes the formulation, coordination and monitoring of policies, standards, 

programs and projects to rationalize the existing transport operations, infrastructure 

requirements, the use of thoroughfares, and promotion of safe and convenient movement of 

persons and goods; provision for the mass transport system and the institution of a system to 

regulate road users; administration and implementation of all traffic enforcement operations, 

traffic engineering services and traffic education programs. 

 

60. On the other hand, Health Sanitation, Urban Protection and Pollution Control include 
the formulation and implementation of policies, rules and regulations, standards, programs 

and projects for the promotion and safeguarding of the health and sanitation of the region and 



17 
 

for the enhancement of ecological balance and the prevention, control and abatement of 

environmental pollution. 

 

61. For CY 2020, a total of P686,302,667.65 was budgeted for MMDA’s Infrastructure 
Projects of TEC, Metrobase, and HEPO funded under local funds. All of these projects are 

on-going as of December 31, 2020. Details are as follows:

62. Review of the Project Monitoring Report disclosed that all of the mentioned projects 
were awarded to contractors only on the 4th quarter of CY 2020. Also, it was noted that there 

were significant gaps in the period of action on specific procurement activities, particularly 

on the issuance of NOA and Pre-Procurement Conference to the issuance of NTP. Summary 

is shown as follows:

63. Discussion with BAC members disclosed that the delay in the conduct of procurement 
activities ranging from three (3) to 143 days as indicated in the Table above was due to limited 

movement of MMDA personnel/officials resulting from alternative work arrangement 

implemented by the Authority due to COVID-19 pandemic quarantine restriction which 

ultimately affected the procurement activities. It was also noted that most of the signatories in 

the procurement activities are members of the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for COVID -

19 and are always preoccupied with work. 

 

64. Meanwhile, it was observed that the schedule for each procurement activity of the 
above mentioned projects, as indicated in the APP, covers the period of January to May 2020. 

However, Section 20 of RA No. 11465 provides that government agencies are authorized to 

expedite the implementation of their procurement activities. Thus, agencies can undertake 

procurement activities, short of award, prior to the approval of the GAA and receipt of 

allotments issued by the DBM. 

 

65. The APP is considered as a major determinant in the choice of strategy to be employed 
as well as in the scheduling of procurement activities which helps delivers an expeditious 

output. Also, it serves as an important tool in resource and financial management, allowing 

the Procuring Entity the flexibility to optimize the utilization of scarce resources. 

 

66. It is understandable that the procurement activities were affected due to COVID-19 
pandemic but the succeeding APPs must be assessed to ensure that the Government 

commitment for an efficient and economic procurement process will be attained.  Due to the 

delays in procurement activities, the timely implementation of the projects was affected. 

 



19 
 

67. We recommended and Management agreed to require BAC to faithfully comply 
with the procurement timelines/period prescribed under Sections 37.1.2, 32.4, 38.2 and 

Annex C of RA No. 9184. 

 

b.1  Non-completion of projects within the specific contract time due to inadequate 

planning and absence of coordination  with the concerned LGUs,  communities 

and other agencies  - P1.203 billion projects 

 

68. The primary consideration of the government for entering into a contract is the timely 
completion of the infrastructure projects so that the intended benefits may be achieved. 

Consequently, the contracting parties are bound to adhere faithfully to agreed terms and 

conditions of the contract.  

 

69.  The worsening traffic congestion in Metro Manila necessitates the adoption of an 
Intelligent Transport System (ITS) to help in the traffic management. A study on the ITS was 

primarily done to serve as a road map for the envisioned upgrading of the existing Metro 

Manila Traffic Signal System and related facilities and equipment, signalization of new 

warranted intersections and associated works into the latest cutting edge technology in ITS. 

The expansion project of traffic signalization of new warranted intersections now with LED 

lightings would greatly help in the safety, productivity, mobility and efficient traffic 

management in the Metropolis. 

 

70. Perusal of the MMDA’s GPPAs Report as of December 31, 2020, submitted by 
Management showed significant delays in the implementation of the projects due to numerous 

Suspension Orders issued by the agency for various reasons pertaining to traffic signalization 

projects as follows:

71. The Audit Team requested from Management their revised target completion of the 
above-mentioned projects. However as of audit report date, none was provided yet by 

Management. Generally, the causes of delay may have been outside of control by the MMDA, 

one of which is the imposition of lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic for which a time 

extension or a revised timeline may be approved by the agency. However, the issues in the 

need for coordination with the LGUs, communities and other agencies, i.e. Department of 

Transportation (DOTr), are those factors which are unintentional but procedural and 

consequential that may affect the timely completion of the projects. 

 

72. The foregoing conditions manifested inadequacy of strategies to implement planned 
activities for which funding/budget was approved for and comprehensive and technical 

evaluation  were already undertaken to establish the viability of the projects thus, depriving 

the target communities of the immediate benefit/use of facilities. 

 

73. We recommended and Management agreed through the TEC, Metrobase and 
HEPO to: 

 

a) ensure that cause/s or factors of delay/non-implementation controllable by the 
agency are properly addressed prior to project implementation; 

 

b) improve full coordination with other agencies, the LGUs, as well as the 
communities for a more effective and synchronized planning of programs and 

projects; and 

 

c) closely monitor the status/progress of the projects to ascertain that the 
strategies adopted are responsive to fast track the implementation of the 

projects.

 b.2  Non-completion of projects within the specific contract time due to unsatisfactory 

performance of the contractor  – P57.036 million project 

 

74. The Phase III of Traffic Signalization Projects totaling P390,392,962.00 presented in 
Table 15 remained incomplete and the project was terminated on February 17, 2020 due to 

unsatisfactory performance.  

 

75. On March 4, 2021, a Memorandum was issued by MMDA requesting for the collection 
and settlement of liabilities of the contractor, Prime Gigabuild Construction Corporation 

(formerly Ron Daniel Construction Corporation), amounting to at least P57,035,645.10 

broken down as follows: 

 
Table 16. Claims from the Contractor 

Particulars 
Amount 

(In PhP) 

Unrecouped advances for mobilization fee less collectibles (unpaid 

progress billings) of contractor 

2,131,559.57 

Missing items of delivered and paid Traffic Signal Facilities based on 

final inventory and turn-over to the Authority 

13,404,642.56 

Liquidated Damages based on remaining work of the Project 41,499,442.97 

Total 57,035,645.10 

 

76. Inquiry with the Head of Traffic Signalization Office disclosed that the said project is 
for bidding in CY 2022 upon approval of the DBM of their request for the additional funding 

pertaining to revised estimated cost of the remaining works of Phase III-Traffic Signalization 

Projects.  

 

77. From the facts presented, the contractor had taken advantage of the interest-free use 
of the advances for purposes other than the contracted works pending resolution of the 

problems/issues.  The agency could have required the return of the advance payments as well 

as the missing inventory items and liquidated damages while the issues have not yet been 

settled/resolved so that the government funds in the hands of the contractor could have been 

utilized to finance other priority projects of the government.  

 

78. We recommended and Management agreed through TEC to demand and 
monitor the settlement of liabilities of Prime Gigabuild Construction Corporation 

(formerly Ron Daniel Construction Corporation), the contractor primarily involved in 

the project. 
 

Management Comments: 
 

79. Management responded that TEC and Metrobase will adhere to the recommendations 
to take appropriate measures in addressing properly the factors/causes of delay before project 

implementation, improve full coordination with government agencies and private sectors for 

synchronized planning of programs and projects and improve strategies to fast track the 

implementation of projects.  

 



23 
 

80. It is worthy to mention that Metrobase has undertaken coordination with private utility 
companies prior to project implementation and requested for as-built plan of their facilities 

located within Metro Manila in order to avoid damage to any installed conduit/pipes/drainage 

facilities within the work area, specifically along the major thoroughfares covered by the 

project. Walk-through and ocular inspection were also conducted by joint teams to facilitate 

activities. 

 

81. For the footbridge project, the Design and Construction of Pedestrian Footbridge along 
Samson Road A. Mabini, a coordination was done before the project implementation, 

however, unforeseen underground facilities of Maynilad, telecommunication facilities and 

high-tension wires of MERALCO took time in removing their facilities. The Enhanced 

Community Quarantine restriction due to COVID-19 pandemic also caused the delay on 

project implementation. For the Design and Construction of Pedestrian Footbridge along 

Regalado Ave., it was completed on March 2, 2021. Coordination with DOTr MRT7 was done 

prior to the project implementation, but was advised to put on-hold the construction of 

footbridge until the completion of the MRT7 guideway structures.  

 

82. Furthermore, for the terminated contract of Phase III-Upgrading of Traffic Signal Field 
Facilities at 155 Signalized Intersections including Integration to the New Command Center, 

a Demand Letter was sent to Mr. Joseph Elton Salimbagon, President of Prime Gigabuild 

Construction Corporation (formerly Ron Daniell Construction Corporation) last April 29, 

2021, and the Legal Service will undertake appropriate legal remedies for the collection and 

settlement of liabilities. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

83. The Audit Team will further validate if Management will be able to implement/comply 
with the recommendations including monitoring of the settlement of liabilities. 

 

 

Non-compliance with the reversion of dormant Cash – P30.070 million 

 

84. The Cash in Bank maintained for MMDA Housing Revolving Fund with a 
balance of P30,070,323.63 as of December 31, 2020 has been idle/unutilized for seven (7) 

years but was not reverted to the General Fund, contrary to COA Circular No. 2015-

001 and DOF-DBM-COA Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012. 

 

85. COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015 prescribes the guidelines and 
procedures in the reversion to the General Fund of all Dormant Cash, Unauthorized Accounts, 

Unnecessary Special and Trust Funds and Related Accounts in conformity with the Permanent 

Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012, implementing Executive 

Order (EO) No. 431 dated May 30, 2005. 

 

86. Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012 defines 
the following relevant terms: 

 



24 
 

 Dormant accounts refer to collections authorized by law to be deposited with an 
Authorized Government Depository Bank (AGDB) but have remained inactive for 

more than five (5) years. 

 

 Unnecessary special and trust funds as authorized special and trust funds 
maintained by government agencies with AGDBs but which are no longer 

necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which said funds were established 

i.e., specific projects/programs, the implementation of which have been completed 

or abandoned. 

 

87. Analysis of the Subsidiary Ledgers of the Cash in Bank accounts of MMDA revealed 
that Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) bank account CA#2882-1019-94, in the name of 

MMDA Housing Revolving Fund, has been unmoving since 2017 with transactions pertaining 

to interests and bank charges only. Details of the account transactions since its establishment 

are as follows:

88. Per inventory of bank accounts submitted by the Accounting Division, the LBP bank 
account was established for the MMDA Housing Revolving Fund through Metro Manila 

Commission (MMC)-MMDA Resolution No. 14-07 dated March 19, 2014. The said 

resolution authorized the allocation of the portion of proceeds from the sale of MMC NAPICO 

properties in the amount of P30,000,000.00 as revolving fund/fund assistance for the MMDA 

Housing Project to assist qualified MMDA employees to avail their own house and lot. 

 

89. Inquiries with the Accounting Division as well as verification of journal entries posted 
in e-NGAS revealed that the Trust Fund for this project was established on January 31, 2017 

through a fund transfer from Philippine National Bank (PNB) General Fund Account No. 265-

540643-6 to LBP - Trust Fund Acct. No. 2882-1019-94. The amount transferred to set-up the 

Trust Fund for the MMDA Housing Project is composed of the following: 

 
Table 18. Amount transferred to set-up the Trust Fund for MMDA Housing Project 

Particulars 
Amount 

(In PhP) 

Principal Amount (Amount authorized per MMC-MMDA Resolution No. 14-07) 30,000,000.00 

Interest earned by the principal amount from March 25, 2014 to January 31, 2017 

when still deposited in Philippine National Bank as computed by the bank  
68,000.00 

Less: Bank Charges 150.00 

Total amount transferred to LBP Acct. No. 2882-1019-94  30,067,850.00 



25 
 

90. Analysis revealed that since the establishment/creation of the trust fund, this bank 
account has been non-moving with transactions pertaining only to interests and bank charges 

as shown in Table 18. The lapse of four (4) years that the said account had not been moving 

made the bank account inactive and deemed no longer necessary or which seemed to be 

already abandoned. 

 

91. In addition, since the amount transferred to the Trust Fund on January 31, 2017 still 
included the principal amount of P30,000,000.00, it could be inferred that the fund has not 

been utilized since the execution of MMC-MMDA Resolution No. 14-07 in 2014, which 

brings the total period that the fund has been inactive to seven (7) years. Furthermore, 

interview with personnel from Planning Division disclosed that there were no current plans to 

continue the implementation of the housing project which would make the maintenance of the 

trust fund no longer necessary. 

 

92. It is the declared policy of the State that unless otherwise specifically provided for by 
law, all income collected by agencies of the government by virtue of the provisions of law, 

orders and regulations shall be deposited in the National Treasury and shall accrue to the 

unappropriated surplus of the General Fund of the Government. Therefore, the maintenance 

of dormant accounts or unnecessary special and trust funds deprives the government of the 

use of the unremitted amount for other programs/projects. 

 

93. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountant to 
conduct a thorough analysis to determine the necessity of maintaining the noted dormant 

trust fund account and undertake the necessary action to facilitate its reversion to the 

general fund as prescribed in the Procedural Guidelines under COA Circular No. 2015-

001 dated January 29, 2015. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

94. Management commented that the audit observation is noted. Since the Planning 
Division declared that there are no plans to continue the implementation of the MMDA 

housing project that resulted in the Cash in Bank being idle/unutilized for seven (7) years, 

Management opted to transfer the amount to General Fund to support the Agency's program 

for COVID-19 response. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

95. As per inquiry with Accounting Division, the transfer of the dormant cash to a bank 
account under the General Fund is still for further validation upon submission of documents 

regarding the transfer and the appropriate journal entries relative to the transaction. Per COA 

Circular No. 2015-001, the dormant trust fund cash accounts maintained for projects which 

has been abandoned shall be remitted to the National Treasury as it shall accrue to the 

unappropriated surplus of the General Fund of the Government and not only of the Agency. 

 

 

 



26 
 

Deficiencies in the grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances 

 

96. Non-compliance with rules and regulations in the granting, utilization and 
liquidation of cash advances (CAs) resulted in (a) insufficient fidelity bonds of three (3) 

special disbursing officers (SDOs) for payroll  to cover their accountabilities for cash 

advances; (b)   CAs granted that  exceeded the authorized amount per duly issued Special 

Orders; (c) CAs granted to five (5) Accountable Officers (AOs) that were not utilized 

and remained in their custody for a period of five (5) to 22 months; (d) additional CAs 

that were granted to two (2) SDOs even without liquidation of previous CAs; and             

(e) existence of long-outstanding unliquidated CAs amounting to P5,766,547.21. 

 

a) Insufficient fidelity bond of three (3) SDOs for payroll to cover  accountabilities 
for CAs 

 

97. Section 14, Volume I of GAM for NGAs provides that, “Except for cash advance for 
official travel, no officer or employee shall be granted cash advance unless he/she is properly 

bonded in accordance with existing laws or regulations. The amount of cash advance which 

may be granted shall not exceed the maximum cash accountability covered by his/her bond”. 

 

98. Section 5.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009 provides that - 
“The amount of bond shall be based on the total accountability (cash, property and accountable 

forms) of the accountable public officer as determined by the head of the Agency. Provided, 

the individual maximum accountability of each accountable officer shall not exceed One 

Hundred Million Pesos (100M) xxx.” 

 

99. The Revised Schedule of Premium Rates shows in part the following: 
 

              

100. Upon validation of the sufficiency of posted fidelity bonds of the AOs in relation to 
the CAs designated under their custody, it was noted that three (3) disbursing officers were 

granted CAs which exceeded the amount of the maximum cash accountability covered by 

their bond. Details are presented in the next page:

101. As can be gleaned from the preceding table, the CAs granted exceeded the maximum 
accountability per their approved bond in the amount ranging from P2,002.10 to 

P1,429,142.54.   

 

102. In addition, the CAs with Check No. 438822 dated November 6, 2020 and 438826 
dated November 9, 2020 amounting to P3,567,625.22 and P3,056,348.00, respectively, were 

granted even without an approved bond to cover the date of the grant, contrary to existing 

laws or regulations. 

 

103. Inadequate fidelity bonding of the SDOs exposes the government to risk that it may 
not be indemnified in case of possible loss of government funds resulting from shortages and 

defalcations thus, proper monitoring of the SDO’s fidelity bonds is required.  

 



28 
 

104. We recommended and Management agreed to post adequate bonds for all AOs 
in order for the government to be appropriately insured against losses pursuant to 

Section 101 of PD No. 1445, Section 14 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, and Section 5.1 of 

Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009. 

 

b) Grant/release of CAs exceeding the authorized amount   
 

105. Section 89 of PD No.1445 provides that no cash advance shall be given unless for a 
legally authorized specific purpose. A cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as 

soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served. No additional cash advance shall 

be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first 

settled or a proper accounting thereof is made. 

 

106. Paragraph 4.4.3 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides that 
the cash advance shall be supported by the following documents: 

 

 Copy of authority by the Agency Head (attachment to initial cash advance); 

 Copy of approved application for bond (attachment to initial cash advance); 

 Budget for COE of the Agency field office or agency activity in the field. 
 

107. Verification of the amount of CAs granted to the SDOs against the authorization issued 
through Special Orders revealed that CAs which exceeded the amount authorized were 

released to the SDO. Further details are as follows:

108. As can be gleaned from the preceding table, there are CAs granted which exceeded 
the authorized amount per approved Special Orders by as much as P52,280.20 to 

P2,429,142.54. 

 

109. Granting or releasing CAs beyond the authorized amount provided through the explicit 
authority from the Head of the Agency or his duly authorized representative may affect the 

legality and validity of the grant thereof. 

 

110. We recommended and Management agreed to stop releasing/granting additional 
CAs to the accountable officer exceeding the authorized amounts allowed by the Head 

of the Agency or his duly authorized representative. 

 

c) CAs granted to five (5) AOs not utilized and remained in their custody for a period 
of five (5) to 22 months 

 

111. Paragraph 5.7 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides that 
“When a cash advance is no longer needed or has not been used for a period of two months, 

it must be returned to or refunded immediately to the collecting officer”. 

 

112. Verification and analysis of the subsidiary ledger balances as of December 31, 2020 
disclosed that the following AOs had no recorded replenishment nor liquidation for 2 to 22 

months as detailed in Table 22.

113. The foregoing may be an indication that the maintenance of these PCFs was no longer 
necessary and should be refunded in accordance with Paragraph 5.7 of COA Circular 97-002. 

 

114. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accounting Division to 
closely monitor the PCF with the view of requiring the refund of all CAs which have 

been idle for a period of at least two months pursuant to paragraph 5.7 of COA Circular 

No. 97-002 and direct the immediate return of the PCF if upon evaluation the 

maintenance thereof is no longer necessary, in order for the Authority to maximize the 

use of government resources. 

 

d) Grant of additional CAs to two (2) SDOs even without liquidation of previous cash 
advances 

 

115. Paragraph 4.1.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 provides that no additional cash 
advances shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given 

to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made. Further, paragraph 4.1.3 thereof 

provides that cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the purpose for which it was given 

has been served. 

 

116. Review of the Subsidiary Ledger of Advances to SDO revealed that additional CAs 
were granted to two (2) SDOs notwithstanding the unliquidated balance of their previous CA, 

contrary to the above regulation. Details are as follows:

1117553 375,000.00  1,022,144.60 

 

117. As shown in the preceding table, CAs were granted to the two (2) SDOs even though 
they still have an unliquidated balance from their previous CAs, which resulted in the 

accumulation of their unliquidated cash advance balances of as much as P5,780,000.00 and 

P1,022,144.60. 

 



33 
 

118. The foregoing practice of granting additional CAs even though previous CAs had not 
yet been fully liquidated and processed indicates weak monitoring of liquidations which may 

expose government funds to risks of misuse and lead to the accumulation of unliquidated CAs 

in large amounts.  

 

119. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountant to: 
 

a) refrain from granting additional CAs unless the previous one has been 
liquidated and accounted for in the books; and 

 

b) issue a Certification for every CA submitted for liquidation to attest that the 
previous ones have been liquidated and accounted for in the books. 

 

e) Existence of long-outstanding unliquidated CAs – P5,766,547.21 
 

120. Section 2 of PD No. 1445 provides that, “It is the declared policy of the State that all 
resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law 

and regulations, and safeguard against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, 

with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of 

government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests 

directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.” 

 

121. Records show that CAs amounting to P5,766,547.21 pertains to unliquidated balances 
of former AOs who were no longer connected with the Agency due to retirement or 

resignation. A request for authority to write-off the dormant CAs was submitted by 

Management to the Audit Team. However, the request was denied by COA on various dates. 

Per Report of Request for Write-off dated December 31, 2020, demand letters will be issued 

by Management for the collection of P726,153.04, while request for authority to write-off will 

be filed again for the remaining balance of P5,040,394.17 upon completion of the required 

supporting documents.  

 

122. The existence of long-outstanding balances, most of which belonged to AOs who were 
allowed to be separated from the service without settling their accountabilities, indicates that 

the Agency had not been strict in monitoring CAs and in enforcing the prescribed period of 

liquidation thereof.    

 

123. This condition resulted in unliquidated balances as of year-end and the high possibility 
of loss of government funds relating to the balances of long-outstanding CAs. 

 

124. We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountant to: 
 

a) properly monitor and enforce the timelines for liquidation and require the 
concerned AOs to immediately liquidate their outstanding CAs for which the 

purpose has been served; and 

 



34 
 

b) exert extra efforts to locate the whereabouts of the AOs with long-outstanding 
CAs and exhaust all available options towards the settlement of their 

accountabilities. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

125. Application for additional bond of the concerned AOs is in-process and subject to 
approval of the National Treasury.  

 

126. For the granting of CA beyond the amount authorized per Special Orders, 
Management stated that this happened only during the pandemic when personnel were on 

skeletal work force while others were on a work-from-home arrangement. During this period, 

there was an instruction to rush the payrolls of personnel most especially the Oyster Group 

who have not received their salaries for several months. Since the Treasury Division has 

limited SDOs at that time, the CAs were lodged to the three SDOs. All these CAs were already 

liquidated at year end.  

 

127. For the two AOs’ CAs with no movement and/or unutilized for more than two (2) 
months, Management commented that they have already pending liquidation or on-going 

compliance with documentary requirements. This included the deceased accountable officer 

who has submitted partial liquidation and the remaining balance is to be deducted from her 

terminal leave.  Demand letters will be issued for them to liquidate their cash advances. 

 

128. For granting of additional CA prior to liquidation and accounting in the books of the 
prior balance, Management commented that the CA of one (1) SDO was used for COVID-19 

response and the immediate purchase of supplies and meals were needed. However, the 

liquidation of the previous CA was submitted to the accounting Office prior to the grant of 

additional one, although still in the process of verification and still not recorded in the books 

during that time. As for the CA of other SDO, there was an erroneous encoding date in e-

NGAS of the liquidation report. It was recorded on December 29, 2020, but the liquidation 

was supposed to be dated December 10, 2020 which is prior to the grant of additional cash 

advance on December 11, 2020. 

 

129. For the long-outstanding unliquidated CAs, Management commented that demand 
letters were sent to said AOs in 1998, 1999, 2000, and in 2012 but no replies were received 

for the settlement of the said long outstanding cash advances. In 2019, the Authority requested 

for write-off of the said long outstanding unliquidated CAs but was advised by the previous 

auditors to exert extra efforts to locate the whereabouts of the concerned AOs. They have 

asked assistance of different agencies such as NBI, DILG, COMELEC and CSC to locate 

them but to no avail. Also, demand letters were again sent to the AOs but no replies were 

received. They will be refiling their Request for write-off of said unliquidated CAs. 

 

 

 

 

 



35 
 

Auditor’s rejoinder: 

 

130. On granting of CA beyond the amount authorized per Special Orders, analysis of 2019 
transactions showed the practice of granting CA for payroll in excess of the authorized amount 

per Special Orders was also done even before the COVID -19 pandemic.  

 

131. On the observation on the grant of additional CA prior to liquidation and accounting 
in the books of the prior balance, Section 1.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 

2012 provides the general guidelines for granting of Cash Advances, which states that, “No 

additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash 

advance given to him is first liquidated and accounted for in the books.” Since the liquidation 

of CAs were still not recorded in the books, the granting of additional one was in violation of 

the mentioned Circular. This was also discussed during the CY 2019 AAR Exit Conference. 

 

132. The actions taken by Management to implement the audit recommendations will be 
further validated and monitored in succeeding audit. 

 

 

Deficiencies pertaining to registration and issuance of motor vehicles – P0.111 million 

 

133. The MMDA, empowered with metro-wide transport and traffic management 
under RA No. 7924, remained non-compliant with Sections 3, 5 and 8 of RA No. 4136 as 

the Authority has: (a) 416 vehicles that have not been registered in CY 2020 due to 

failure to comply with the Land Transportation Office (LTO) inspection pending 

repairs/rehabilitation of vehicles for registration; and (b) 30 vehicles that were issued to 

end-users despite the registration of vehicles under the name of the previous owners. 

Moreover, late registration of vehicles resulted in the incurrence of unnecessary 

penalties totaling P110,917.00.  

 

134. The MMDA’s scope of services pursuant to Section 3 of RA No. 7924 (the law 
creating the MMDA) covers, among other services, transport and traffic management, to wit:  

 

“Transport and traffic management which include the formulation, coordination, 

and monitoring of policies, standards, programs and projects to rationalize the 

existing transport operations, xxx provision for the mass transport system and the 

institution of a system to regulate road users; administration and implementation of 

all traffic enforcement operations, traffic engineering services and traffic education 

programs, including the institution of a single ticketing system in Metropolitan 

Manila.” 

 

135. Related thereto, RA No. 4136, an act on the laws relative to land transportation and 
traffic rules, requires the following, among others:  

 

 Section 5 requires that all motor vehicles and other vehicles must be registered; 
hence,  

 



36 
 

(a) No motor vehicle shall be used or operated on or upon any public highway of 
the Philippines unless the same is properly registered for the current year in 

accordance with the provisions of this Act. 

 

(b) Any registration of motor vehicles not renewed on or before the date fixed for 
different classifications, as provided hereunder shall become delinquent and 

invalid. xxx 
 

 Section 8 provides the Schedule of registration fees stating that except as otherwise 
specifically provided in the Act, each application for renewal of registration of motor 

vehicles shall be accompanied by an annual registration fee.  

 

136. Joint Administrative Order No. 2014-01 provided the revised schedule of fines and 
penalties for violation of laws, rules and regulations governing land transportations. 

 

137. The MMDA, given the authority on traffic enforcement operations, traffic engineering 
services and traffic education programs, including the institution of a single ticketing system 

in Metropolitan Manila, has not faithfully complied with the LTO traffic rules requirements 

on vehicle registration, as discussed in the following paragraphs: 

 

a) Non-registration/non-renewal of registration of Motor Vehicles in CY 2020 
 

138. One of the functions of the Transport Division (TD) is to register all vehicles owned 
by MMDA. Available records obtained from the TD disclosed that of the 763 vehicles, 

excluding the unserviceable vehicles, recorded in the Report on the Physical Count of 

Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE), only 347 motor vehicles,  motorcycles, service 

vehicles and trucks had been registered with the LTO in CY 2020. Hence, 416 units or 54.52 

percent of the total motor vehicles were still unregistered with the LTO. 

 

139. In the letter dated January 26, 2021 of the TD Unit Head to the Audit Team, the 
following are the reasons/causes why various MMDA vehicles were not regularly 

renewed/registered to LTO: 

 

1. Various vehicles did not pass in LTO Inspection due to defective signal light, plate 
light and brake light, failed smoke emission, faulty electrical wirings, unsightly 

body, corroded/unreadable chassis number and among others. Some vehicles are 

non-operational during the renewal month particularly those old vehicles since 

they need to undergo repairs/rehabilitation. 

 

2. There are lacking/incomplete documents required to comply with the inspection 
and documentation policy for the renewal of LTO registration. 
 

3. Some end-users failed to coordinate with the TD for LTO inspection. They are 
more focused on operations. 

 

140. Aging of motor vehicles owned by the MMDA revealed that most of them had already 
exceeded their useful/service life as shown in Tables 24 and 25.

141. The current status of the above listed vehicles is an indication that one (1) of the seven 
(7) mandates of MMDA which is the Transport and Traffic Management, covering the 

administration and implementation of all traffic enforcement operations such as imposition of 

penalties for unregistered vehicles, is not attained. 

 

142. In compliance to our previous years’ audit recommendations, the Agency had issued 
various Memoranda geared to avoid the late and non-renewal of registration of MMDA 

vehicles, to wit: 
 

1. Memoranda issued to end-users reminding them the prescribed date of registration 
and inspection to LTO; 

 

2. Memorandum dated October 15, 2020 issued by former MMDA Chairman Danilo 
Lim requiring all offices of MMDA for the submission of inventory and status 

report of service vehicles and equipment assigned to them; 

 

3. Memorandum dated October 15, 2020 issued by Atty. Romando S. Artes, AGM 
for Finance and Administration, banning the use of unregistered MMDA motor 

vehicles wherein violator/s shall be charged administratively in accordance with 

the provisions of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service 

(RRACCS); and 

 

4. Memorandum dated October 22, 2020 issued by Undersecretary Frisco S. San 
Juan, Jr, creating a Committee to evaluate and study the Agency’s current fleet of 



38 
 

vehicles in order to determine its road worthiness, as well as the need to replace 

unserviceable vehicles. 

 

143. Interview with TD Unit Head disclosed that the above-mentioned Memoranda were 
not implemented in CY 2020 due to the limited movement of the MMDA officials/personnel 

as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine restrictions.  

 

144. Also, due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, MMDA in cooperation with LTO 
had conducted one-day registration caravan on October 30, 2020, to cater the renewal of 

unregistered MMDA vehicles due to COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

145.  However, despite of the above actions taken by the Authority, there were still 416 
MMDA owned vehicles not registered with the LTO. As one of the implementing agency for 

Traffic Enforcement, MMDA should act as a role model for the public in following strictly 

the rules and regulations prescribed by the LTO for motor vehicle renewal/registration. 
 

b) Various vehicles issued but still registered under the name of previous owners 
 

146. Audit disclosed that there were 30 vehicles issued to end-users which were registered 
in CY 2020 under the names of the previous owners, contrary to Section 3 of RA No. 4136 or 

the Land Transportation and Traffic Code. The said law defines the “owner” as the actual 

legal owner of a motor vehicle in whose name such vehicle is registered with the LTO. Until 

the transfer of ownership is registered in the name of the new owner, the previous owner is 

still considered the registered owner of the motor vehicle. Details of registered vehicles under 

the names of previous owners are as follows:

147. In relation thereto, the Transport Unit Head informed the Audit Team of the following:  
 

1. For Honda Civic with Plate No. ZNN 273, there are no available documents such 
as Deed of Donation to comply with the transfer registration requirements of the 

LTO.  

2. For all the vehicles registered under the name of the DPWH-NCR, the LTO is 
requiring MMDA to provide the Deed of Donation for the transfer of registration. 

 

3. The transfer of Certificate of Registration (CR) to MMDA for the remaining 
vehicles is currently being handled by previous owners. 

 

c) Incurrence of penalties due to late registration – P110,917.00 
 

148. In CY 2020, the MMDA incurred unnecessary expenses representing penalties for late 
registration/renewal of motor vehicles amounting to P110,917.00.  

 

149. According to TD, the various vehicles were not renewed within the prescribed period 
as most of the vehicles did not immediately pass or were not cleared with the LTO inspector. 

Common noted deficiencies by the LTO inspector are broken windshield, failed smoke 

emission, unreadable chassis number and among others. In compliance thereof, the MMDA 

had issued Memoranda to end-users reminding them to have the required LTO inspection of 

the vehicle one-month before the prescribed date of registration so as to give end-users ample 

time to make the necessary repairs, if possible.  

 

150. In effect, the lapses to faithfully observe reasonable steps in monitoring the needed 
repairs and documentation for the timely registration of the vehicles resulted in wastage of 

government funds due to the unnecessary penalties. 

 

151. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a) ensure that all MMDA-owned motor vehicles are promptly registered with 
LTO as government vehicles under the name of the MMDA;  

 

b) require the Transport Division to: 
 

i. renew the registration of all serviceable motor vehicles within the 
period prescribed to avoid incurrence of penalties; and 

 

ii. provide the detailed information per vehicle as to the reasons/causes 
of non-renewal/non-registration of 416 MMDA vehicles with the LTO. 

 

Management Comments: 
 

152. Management commented that another LTO caravan was held on February 16-17, 
2021. The LTO Caravan covers some of the unregistered vehicles in previous years up to CY 

2020 and the renewal of registration up to plate ending in “4” for the year 2021. 

 



40 
 

153. With regard to 416 vehicles that were not registered in CY 2020, 14 vehicles are 
registered in CY 2020, others were identified as “off-road” which does not require 

Registration while others are “under repair” and lack or with incomplete documents. The 

remaining vehicles are for identification in coordination with the Supply and Property 

Division. However, for those not registered in CY 2020, the registration process continues 

simultaneous with the renewal of registration. 

 

154. With regard to various vehicles still registered under the name of previous owners, 
Transport Division is in constant communication with the previous owner. Management hopes 

to have most of the 30 vehicles transferred to MMDA within this year. 

 

155. The COVID-19 pandemic that happened since March 2020 also affected the 
registration internally and externally. The implementation of sudden lockdown of offices, the 

skeletal workforce and quarantined personnel from the involved agencies greatly affected the 

processing of registration. 

 

 

Lost opportunities for collection of revenues 

 

156. The MMDA was not able to maximize the collection of fines and penalties due to: 
(a) non/delayed encoding of 4,869 issued Ordinance Violation Receipt (OVR) tickets in 

the Metropolitan Road Rules Enforcement System (MRRES) resulting in the risk of 

underassessment of fines and penalties; (b) lack of the calibrated speed guns since CY 

2018 to enforce traffic regulation on the speed limit, thus, resulting in the lost revenues 

by approximately P18.946 million for three-years; and (c) significantly low percentage 

of traffic violators summoned (number of notices of violation issued over the total 

number of violations captured). 

 

157. Under RA No. 7924 or the law creating the MMDA, one of the powers and functions 
of the Agency is to “install and administer a single ticketing system, fix, impose and collect 

fines and penalties for all kinds of violations of traffic rules and regulations, whether moving 

or non-moving in nature, and confiscate and suspend or revoke driver’s licenses in the 

enforcement of such traffic laws and regulations.  

 

158. Analytical review performed on the Revenue accounts of the MMDA in CY 2020 
showed that there was a notable decrease in the collected fines and penalties imposed by the 

Agency as summarized below: 

 
Table 31. Summary of Decrease in Collected Fines and Penalties

         *extracted from e-NGAS on April 12, 2021 

 



41 
 

159. The decrease in collected fines and penalties were largely attributable to lapses in the 
internal controls relating to the assessment and collection of the fines and penalties as well as 

traffic laws that ceased to be enforced due to pandemic such as the yellow lanes and coding 

scheme.  The Agency was not able to maximize the collections which could have been used 

for its programs and projects for the benefit of the public and for its own operating 

requirements due to the following:  

 

a. Non/delayed-encoding of issued OVR tickets in the MRRES   
 

160. On March 28, 2006, MMDA entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with 
STRADCOM Corporation to secure the latter’s services in the development, implementation, 

operation and maintenance of a fully automated MRRES. It is an online and real time 

interconnection system with the LTO Information Technology (IT) Project for motor vehicle 

and driver’s license databases and also creates an alarm in the Motor Vehicle Registration 

System and/or Driver’s Licensing System of the LTO. Thus, the Law Enforcement and Traffic 

Adjudication System becomes more efficient and effective in its mandate to enforce traffic 

rules and regulations within the Metropolitan Area and ensure efficient revenue collection. 

 

161. The interconnection of the MRRES with the LTO IT Project permitted the creation of 
alarm to the LTO for unsettled OVRs, compelling the violators to secure clearance from the 

Authority before they can renew their license or vehicle registration. Based on the process 

flow provided by the OVR Redemption, clearance procedures start with the concerned 

violator/payor filling-up the application form and attaching the requirements. He/she will then 

undergo computer verification of driver/vehicle records through MRRES and manual 

verification of old Traffic Violation Receipt (TVRs), which is now the OVR, for violations 

dated earlier than 2004. For individuals with more than three (3) violations, a seminar 

conducted by the TEC Traffic Education Center shall be completed. The total amount of 

penalties will be assessed through the violations encoded in the MRRES and violations from 

old TVR records and will be collected by the Treasury Operation Service. The alarm will be 

lifted upon validation of payment. The process ends with the preparation and issuance of 

clearance. 

 

162. Upon matching the OVR tickets issued to enforcers pertaining to CY 2020 
apprehensions against the extracted data on encoded tickets as of March 31, 2021, findings 

showed that there were 4,869 tickets that were not encoded. 

 

163. The foregoing condition suggests that there was an apparent insufficiency of controls 
implemented to prevent the occurrence of unencoded tickets thus, resulted in the 

underassessment of penalties to be paid and subsequently under collection of revenues which 

deprives the government of the use thereof for programs/projects. 

 

164. Although corrections may be made in the system to encode the noted tickets, the 
delayed encoding may also result in negative feedback from the public, particularly when they 

make a payment based on their assessed violations in the MRRES and then afterwards being 

informed that they still have a pending penalty/ies and violation alert with the LTO since these 

were not included in their previous assessment due to late encoding.  



42 
 

 

165. Furthermore, unencoded tickets hamper the process of redemption of the concerned 
person/violator when his ticket has no record yet in the MRRES since redemption has yet to 

go through the manual records of the person to determine the correct amount to be assessed. 

This may result in unnecessary inconvenience to the public.  

 

b. Lack of the calibrated speed guns since CY 2018 
 

166. The Overspeeding Enforcement Group (OSEG) was established in 2011 for the 
enforcement of MMDA Regulation No. 11-003 dated June 23, 2011 which sets the maximum 

speed limit to 60 km/hour for all types of vehicles including motorcycles traversing Diosdado 

Macapagal Avenue located in the cities of Pasay and Paranaque. The area of coverage was 

subsequently extended to include the area from Philcoa to Dona Carmen along 

Commonwealth Avenue in Quezon City per Memorandum Circular No. 04-2013 dated 

February 22, 2013 of the MMDA. 

 

167. Memorandum Circular No. 14-2011 dated August 17, 2011 sets forth the guidelines 
in the implementation of MMDA Regulation 11-003 and provided the following fines to be 

imposed on violators of the three types of over-speeding: 

 
Table 32. Fines imposed on Over-Speeding Violations on LGUs of Pasay and Paranaque

Paranaque 1,000.00 5,000.00 or 6 months imprisonment 2,000.00 and traffic seminar 

 

168. MMDA Regulation No. 17-003 dated December 5, 2017 was also issued to establish 
a 50 km/hr speed limit on buses and trucks traversing the circumferential and radial roads in 

Metro Manila, as follows: 

 
Table 33. Area of Coverage of MMDA Regulation No. 17-003 

Circumferential Roads Radial Roads 

Recto Avenue Roxas Boulevard 

Pres. Quirino Avenue Taft Avenue 

Araneta Avenue SLEX 

EDSA Shaw Boulevard 

C.P. Garcia Avenue Ortigas Avenue 

Southeast Metro Manila Expressway Magsaysay Blvd./Aurora Blvd.  

 Quezon Ave./Commonwealth Ave. 

 A. Bonifacio Avenue 

 Rizal Avenue 

 Del Pan/ Marcos Highway/McArthur Highway 

 

169. Moreover, MMDA Regulation No. 19-001 dated March 26, 2019 established a speed 
limit of 60 km/hour for all other motor vehicles for the same areas covered by MMDA 

Regulation No. 17-003 for which a penalty of P1,000.00 was established for any violator. 

 



43 
 

170. The OSEG use calibrated speed guns which are specially designed cameras used to 
identify and capture motorists who violate the established speed limit. The OSEG has two 

speed guns which were last calibrated on August 29, 2016. Upon expiration of the calibration 

in 2017, the apprehension for overspeeding violations had ceased due to the lack of reliable 

and accurate equipment. Since then, the function of the OSEG personnel has been to assist the 

No Contact Apprehension Policy (NCAP) unit by taking videos of traffic violations, Yellow 

Lane, MC Lane, HOV Policy and other violations apprehended by NCAP, through handheld 

cameras. The OSEG also performs contact apprehensions through issuance of UOVR tickets. 

 

171. Inspection of documents provided by the OSEG disclosed that purchase request for 
the re-calibration of the speed guns were accomplished on April 24, 2018, eight (8) months 

after the expiration of the last calibration. However, per inquiry with personnel from OSEG, 

the procurement coincided with the election ban at that time and the purchase request did not 

materialize. Another purchase request was prepared on the same date for the procurement of 

additional two (2) speed guns but was also not completed. The BAC declared a failure of 

bidding per BAC Resolution 2018-455 dated December 21, 2018, since no bid proposal were 

received at the scheduled deadline of submission.                                                

 

172. The next purchase request prepared was for four (4) speed guns dated January 23, 
2019, for which a bid opening was conducted on November 4, 2019, but the procurement also 

did not push through for reasons that have not been disclosed in the inquiries made. In 

February 2021, a new purchase request was prepared for four (4) speed guns and is yet to be 

approved as of audit report date. 

 

173. Due to the lack of the calibrated speed guns, the MMDA Regulation No. 11-003 on 
speed limit was last implemented in 2017. Based on the submitted accomplishment report of 

OSEG, the total apprehensions on speed limit were 5,766 in CY 2016 and 6,865 in CY 2017. 

Multiplied by the minimum fine imposed for these violations, the apprehensions are 

equivalent to at least P5,766,000.00 for CY 2016 and P6,865,000.00 for CY 2017 for a total 

of P12,631,000.00, or P6,315,500.00 on the average per year. These figures are reflective of 

the lost revenues approximately, P18,946,500.00 for a three-year period, which the Agency 

could have collected had the speed limit requirement been enforced effectively and 

continuously for CYs 2018, 2019 and 2020. 

 

174. In addition, an MMDA report published on the Agency’s website on September 8, 
2020 showed that over speeding was one of the major causes of road crashes in Metro Manila. 

Enforcement of the MMDA Regulation on the maximum speed limit could also have 

contributed on the campaign to decrease the number of traffic accidents that results to tragic 

loss of life and property. 

 

c. Significantly low percentage of traffic violators summoned 
 

175. The process for the No Contact Apprehension starts with the capture of video and 
image of vehicles violating traffic rules and regulations. This process is done by the CCTV 

Operators in Metrobase and also through the handheld cameras of the OSEG. These captured 

videos are forwarded to the NCAP Office through a shared network server. The ticketing 



44 
 

enforcers in NCAP reviews the videos and prepares the notice of violation/summon upon 

validation that a violation was committed and was clearly captured in the video. 

 

176. Analysis of the data provided by the NCAP Office showed that there was a 
significantly low percentage of violations summoned relative to the number of videos captured 

pertaining to traffic violations. Only 31 percent, 14 percent and 28 percent of the captured 

videos of traffic violations were issued a summon/citation ticket for CYs 2018, 2019 and 2020, 

respectively, summarized as follows:

Total 1,632,641 349,200  1,273,645 

 

177. Per inquiry with the NCAP Deputy Head, the low percentage of violations issued is 
attributable to the same factors that also existed in 2019, such as: 

 

(i) Backlogs in reviewing the raw videos due to lack of manpower 
 

178. Currently, there are 19 ticketing officers in NCAP. The apprehending officers takes 
10 minutes to validate the video and image of moving vehicle violating traffic rules and 

regulations. Then, he will retrieve the registration record of the captured vehicle thru the LTO 

Information Query Facility which takes about 3-5 minutes. Finally, he/she encodes and prints 

the summon which takes about 2-3 minutes. Overall, the total time it takes to review the video 

to the printing of the summon is 15-18 minutes. 

 

179. In CY 2019 alone, raw videos totaled 901,851 videos. Considering the average number 
of minutes from review to printing of summons, each ticketing enforcer can review up to 29 

videos per day. However, prior interview revealed that each ticketing enforcer is given a quota 

of 50 videos per day to account for the lack of manpower, although there is no written 

Memorandum for this and the instruction was only verbal. Considering the quota provided for 

the 17 ticketing enforcers in CY 2019, the total capacity of the NCAP was 850 per day. 

Multiplied by standard days per year of 261 days, a total of 221,850 videos can be reviewed 

per year. This is way below the 50 percent of the total videos captured by the Metrobase and 

by the handheld cameras in CY 2019.  

 

180. In CY 2020, the number of captured traffic violations was reduced by 83 percent due 
to removal of the bus lanes and lifting of coding which contributed the most to the total number 

of violations committed by motorists. In addition, implementation of lockdowns relative to 



45 
 

the COVID-19 pandemic decreased the number of captured traffic violations due to reduced 

number of motorists. Even so, the previous year backlogs caused by the insufficient manpower 

in the NCAP office and worsened by the skeletal work arrangement in the light of the COVID-

19 pandemic has resulted in the “voiding” of the captured traffic violations which had 

remained unvalidated for more than one (1) year. This is further discussed in the following 

paragraphs regarding voided violations. 

 

181. Backlogs in the review of the videos results in the delayed/ non-issuance of the 
summons which could impede the effective enforcement of traffic rules and consequently 

preclude the Agency from maximizing the revenue collections therefrom. 

 

 (ii)  Corrupted files due to computer virus  

 

182. As per submitted report by the NCAP, a total of 100,266 videos of traffic violations 
captured by the OSEG from June to August 2018 were corrupted due to a computer virus. 

This damaged the external hard disk drive and thus were not validated by the apprehending 

officers resulting in the non-issuance of citation tickets/summons. Per interview with NCAP 

Head, the hard disks containing the corrupted files were checked by the Management 

Information System Staff (MISS) which issued a certification that the external hard drive used 

by the NCAP Office was brought to them for checking last December 2018. However, upon 

their testing, the hard drive was no longer operational. The NCAP also asked for assistance of 

a third party to repair the damaged disk but also arrived at the same result.  

 

(iii) Voided violations after one year even without approved policy issued 
 

183. Moreover, per inquiry with personnel from NCAP, captured violations for which one 
year had lapsed from the date the violation was committed were voided, such that 

summons/notices of violation will no longer be sent for these violations as the apprehended 

may no longer acknowledge the violation when a significant period had already lapsed from 

the time the violation was committed. 

 

184. According to personnel from NCAP, there is no written memorandum regarding the 
voiding of traffic violations for which one year had lapsed since the time the violation is 

committed. 

 

(iv) Poor quality of the captured video  
 

185. One of the reasons cited for the low percentage of summons created was the poor 
quality of the videos captured in the Metrobase. Issuance of citation tickets to incorrect plate 

number is avoided as well as uncertain apprehensions when the violation is not clearly 

captured so that unclear videos were disregarded in the preparation of summons. 

 

186. In line with the Agency’s embarkment to develop   its Intelligent Transport System 
(ITS) capacities since CY 2011, MMDA entered into a contract agreement with Net Pacific, 

Inc./Dimax Technologies Center/NTechnologies Corporation (Consortium) for the 

Procurement and Installation of CCTV cameras for the MMDA’s No Contact Apprehension 



46 
 

Program with a contract amount of P319,954,396.00. The contract was notarized on 

November 12, 2019 and the NTP was acknowledged by the Contractor on November 15, 2019. 

The project completion period shall be 720 calendar days from the date of NTP. The project 

is on-going as of audit date. 

 

187. It was noted that the procurement process for the project was only completed on the 
4th quarter of 2019. The DBM has issued Circular Letter No. 2010-9 dated December 30, 

2010 directing government agencies to expedite the implementation of their procurement 

activities. Thus, agencies can undertake procurement activities, short of award, prior to the 

approval of the GAA, and receipt of allotments issued by the DBM. Compliance thereof could 

have allowed early implementation of the project. 

 

188. In line with the Agency’s objective to support the intensified campaign and 
implementation of the NCAP, the effective and timely implementation of the project could 

reverberate the increase in the revenue-generation function of the Agency since better quality 

cameras could result in more appropriate apprehensions from which accurate summons could 

be generated and issued. 

 

189. The foregoing conditions where the traffic violations captured were not reviewed and 
issued a summon tend to decrease the revenues collected by the Agency since traffic fines and 

penalties cannot be imposed without the due notice to the apprehended motorist. In addition, 

non-issuance of notices of violation seemingly equates to ineffective implementation of the 

traffic policies relative to NCAP for the period where the captured traffic violations were 

disregarded due to backlogs and lapse of time, corruption of files and poor quality of captured 

videos. This goes against the mandated function of the agency to enforce all traffic laws and 

regulations in Metro Manila. 

 

190. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a) direct the Redemption Unit to encode all the noted unencoded tickets and 
thereafter, formulate a written policy to strengthen supervision and 

monitoring over encoding of the OVR tickets to assess the penalties on a 

timely basis and maximize the collection of revenues therein; 

 

b) speed up the procurement of the necessary calibrated speed guns of the OSEG 
to address the non-enforcement of traffic regulation on the maximum speed 

limit, thus henceforth generate revenue from fine imposed for these recurring 

over speeding violations and to decrease the number of traffic accidents; 

 

c) devise an action plan to improve the number of summons/notices of violation 
created from captured traffic violations by: 

 

i. addressing the insufficiency of manpower in NCAP to avoid backlogs; 
 

ii. ensuring that all captured violations are protected from the risk of 
corruption of files;  



47 
 

 

iii. formulating a written policy that will direct the NCAP Office to ensure 
that all captured traffic violations are reviewed and if warranted, a notice 

of violation is prepared, within a reasonable period to avoid the captured 

violations from being disregarded/voided due to lapse of time; and 

 

iv. monitoring the timely implementation of the project for Procurement and 
Installation of CCTV cameras for MMDA No Contact Apprehension 

which will improve the quality of videos of the captured traffic violations. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

191. Non/delayed encoding of the tickets were due to late transmittal of tickets which were 
encoded upon receipt, non-transmittal of the tickets for which the apprehending officers were 

provided a warning for non-remittance to Redemption Unit, tickets that were returned to OVR 

Supply due to the death of an enforcer and due to the medical condition of another enforcer, 

damaged tickets, incorrect entry and overlooked tickets. 

 

192. Since CY 2017, the Overspeeding Group has been requesting for the acquisition of 
new speed guns which conforms with the international standards and with secure data 

encryption. Unfortunately, each bidding process resulted in failed bid. For the medium term 

solution, they have an ongoing Public Private Partnership (PPP) with Awin Construction in 

which one of the projects is the installation of CCTV cameras which is capable of capturing 

overspeeding vehicles. 

 

193. Currently, there is no more backlogs in the NCAP since the implementation of the new 
busway system. The unit head requested the NCAP personnel to be included in the refresher 

course at the Traffic Education Center in Sta. Mesa Manila so they can familiarize themselves 

with the traffic violations. Through the course, it is expected that lesser complaints will be 

received. The unit head also recommended a personnel to undergo photography trainings and 

seminars to improve the quality of captured videos. 

 

194. Management had stated in their reply that they will abide with all the 
recommendations. 

 

Auditor’s rejoinder: 

 

195. The late or non-transmittal of the tickets issued is an indication that the OVRs were 
not properly controlled and monitored which may result in lost tickets that are not reported 

immediately and late/non-encoding of used OVR tickets. The Audit Team will further validate 

in the succeeding audit if Management is able to strengthen the supervision and monitoring 

over the OVR tickets.   

 

196. As NCAP commented that there were no more backlogs in the review of violations 
and preparation of notices, it was noted that backlogs from previous years were not considered 



48 
 

since they were already deemed voided due to lapse of one year. Management’s action on this 

matter will be further validated and monitored in the succeeding audit.

The Agency was not compliant with the various provisions of PCW-NEDA-

DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 dated March 18, 2014 and other GAD 

related issuances. 

 

MMDA failed to observe the timelines prescribed in the processing and 

submission of GAD reports in accordance with the applicable guidelines. 

 

Review of the submitted documents revealed the following: 

 

 Review and approval of GPB in May 2020 was  way beyond the deadline of 
August to November 2019. 

 

 Agency was able to submit the CY 2020 GAD AR to PWC earlier than the 
deadline. 

 

 Management submitted to COA its Agency-level approved GPB prior to the 
review and endorsement of PCW and its final and endorsed Agency-Level 

approved report with GMMS Authentication was not submitted to COA 

including its GAD AR which is still being reviewed by PCW as of report 

date. 

 

The prescribed deadlines in the submission of GAD Reports were not strictly 

observed and followed due to slow movement of reports/documents within the 

agency and to PCW caused by the pandemic. The communication with PCW 

reviewers   slowed down and/or delayed including the submission of the 

Accomplishment Reports and supporting documents to the GAD Secretariat of 

the various implementing units/divisions of MMDA involved in specific GAD 

activity. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed thru the GAD Focal Point 

System (GFPS) to: 

 

a) submit the approved and endorsed annual GPB and GAD AR for CY 
2020 (with GMMS Authentication) pursuant to PCW Memorandum 

Circular No. 2019-02 and PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01;  

 

b) strictly follow the prescribed timelines in the preparation and submission 
of GAD Reports per PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2019-02 and 

PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 to facilitate timely processing 

and the subsequent review and endorsement by the PCW; and

Section 4.4 of PCW - National 

Economic Development Authority 

(NEDA) and DBM  Joint Circular 

No. 2012-0101 dated March 18, 

2014 (Institutionalizing GAD 

Database/Sex-disaggregated Data) 

provides that the agency shall 

develop or integrate in its existing 

database (Gender and 

Development) GAD information 

to include gender statistics and 

sex-disaggregated data that have 

been systematically produced or 

gathered as inputs or bases for 

planning, budgeting, 

programming, and policy 

formulation 

MMDA failed to provide Sex-Disaggregated Data or set-up a GAD database 

to serve as basis for gender-responsive planning, programming and policy 

formulation 

 

On a letter dated February 5, 2021 and reiterated on March 22, 2021, the Audit 

Team requested Management to submit gender statistics and sex-disaggregated 

data that have been systematically produced or gathered as inputs or bases for 

planning, budgeting, programming, and policy formulation in accordance with 

Section 4 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012. As of March 31, 2021, 

the agency was not able to submit the said information which precluded the Audit 

Team to validate compliance with the aforementioned guidelines.  

 

As stated in the GAD AR of MMDA, Survey Questionnaire was formulated to 

gather sex-disaggregated data on various offices of MMDA but the same was not 

pursued/implemented due to the pandemic. However, from the above 

information, Management also failed to maximize their efforts and to take 

advantage of the online platforms available to have the survey accomplished 

online if the respondents are not physically available to answer such surveys. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the GFPS to:  

 

a) undertake gender analysis to identify and confirm existing gender issues 
and ensure that the programs, projects and activities are responsive to 

the said issues; 

 

b) institutionalize the GAD database with adequate and systematically 
gathered sex-disaggregated data which will provide the bases for gender 

analysis, planning, programming and policy formulation; and 

 

c) coordinate with/seek assistance from the agency’s MISS in the 
establishment/development of a systematic and effective GAD Database. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

To comply with the recommendation of COA, sex-disaggregated data in detailed 

breakdown as to employment status, age, length of service, position level, highest 

educational attainment, field of expertise, salary grade and eligibility were 

collated and submitted to the Audit Team. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

Management complied with the submission of sex-disaggregated data as of 

December 31, 2020 that will be used as basis for gender analysis, planning and 

policy formulation in CY 2021. However, the gender statistics/sex-disaggregated 

data lacked gender analysis which shall include investigating disparities between 

gathered data, reasons and addressing any gaps.  

 

Moreover, the submitted data are manually gathered and the assistance of MISS, 

as recommended by the Audit Team, in order to establish or develop a systematic 



50 
 

LRRs Observations and Recommendations  

and effective GAD database as a reliable tool for gender, analysis, planning, 

programming and policy formulation was not complied. 

 

Part 3.4 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM 

Joint Circular 2012-001 provides 

that “To aid gender 

mainstreaming, agencies shall 

perform gender analysis using 

existing tools, such as the HGDG 

to ensure that the different 

concerns of women and men are 

addressed equally and equitably in 

their PAPs.”  

 

Moreover, Part 10.2 of the same 

circular provides that “In case an 

agency attributes a portion or the 

whole of the budget of its major 

program to the GAD budget, it 

shall subject the same to the 

HGDG test to determine the actual 

expenditures that may be 

attributed to the GAD budget. If 

required, the agency may present 

the HGDG test result to GAD 

funds audit to justify GAD budget 

expenses. The result of the HGDG 

test shall be submitted to PCW.” 

MMDA failed to establish the reliability of Gender Analysis conducted 

through the use of the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines 

(HGDG) Checklist in the Assessment of Gender-Responsiveness of 

Programs and Projects. 

 

On March 26, 2021, Management was able to submit two (2) accomplished 

HGDG Checklist but the following observations were noted: 

 

 HGDG checklist was not properly used to determine actual expenditures 
attributable to GAD projects.  

 

 Other reported projects/programs that were mainstreamed to GAD 
activities and expenditures   were not provided with any HGDG 

evaluation. 

 

It was commendable that for FY 2020, the agency started to use the HGDG 

checklist to evaluate their programs and projects to be included in GAD as 

compared in the prior years. However, the Agency was not able to use its 

application fully to help them assess the gender-responsiveness of their major 

programs and projects and properly address gender issues integrated in its GPB 

and GAD AR. The HGDG is a tool designed for government agencies to integrate 

gender concerns not only from the design and management but to the 

implementation, monitoring and evaluation of agency programs and projects. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed through the GFPS to: 

 

a) educate and require their GAD Focal Persons/Alternates per offices to 
institutionalize the use of the HGDG templates from planning and 

budgeting up to the implementation and reporting phase of programs 

and projects; and 

 

b) apply the HGDG Checklist for the proper assessment of programs and 
projects and proper evaluation of development interventions that will 

contribute in the achievement of the organizational goals/outcomes. 

 

Section 9.2 of the PCW-NEDA-

DBM Joint Circular 2012-01 dated 

March 18, 2014 provides that 

“Agencies shall inform the PCW 

in writing if there are changes in 

the PCW-endorsed GPBs as a 

result of revising the GPB based 

on the approved GAA and or the 

need to implement additional 

PAPs relevant to current gender 

issues or GAD-related 

undertakings as needed. PCW, in 

turn, shall acknowledge receipt of 

adjusted GPB and shall inform the 

Three (3) activities reported and implemented by the Agency under GAD 

Programs and Projects with expenditures amounting to P6.721 million were 

not included in the approved GPB for CY 2020. The said activities were also 

not provided with HGDG evaluation to determine if appropriate to be 

included under GAD. 

 

There are three (3) programs/activities with aggregate cost of P6,720,841.71 that 

were not included in the approved GPB of the agency, thus, have not been 

evaluated by PCW if acceptable and can be considered and included in GAD 

expenditures pursuant to Section 9.2 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular 

2012-01 and with zero GAD budget allotted.

activities in the adjusted GPB are 

acceptable. 

 

Section 10.b of the same Circular

the budget of its major program to 

the GAD budget, it shall subject 

the same to the HGDG test to

budget. If required, the agency 

may present the HGDG test result 

to GAD funds audit to justify GAD 

budget expenses. The result of the 

HGDG test shall be submitted to 

PCW.” 

 

Since there was no HGDG checklist submitted relative to the above projects it 

could not be ascertained whether these programs/activities were evaluated to be 

gender-responsive and appropriate to be included as part of GAD activities 

 

We recommended and Management agreed through the GFPS to: 

 

a) comply with Section 9.2 and Section 10.b of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint 
Circular 2012-01 to formally inform PCW if there are changes or 

additional P/P/As that need to be included in the GPB and to assess 

whether acceptable and consistent with the purpose of GAD; and 

 

b) strictly monitor and implement only programs and projects that are 
contained in the reviewed and evaluated Annual GPB or as 

appropriately revised. 

 

Section 10.b of the PCW-NEDA-

DBM Joint Circular 2012-01 

provides that “In case an agency

Expenditures for two (2) programs in the amount of P9.967 million was 

inappropriately considered as part of GAD Expenditures. 

 

As a result of review of the GAD AR and its supporting documents, it was 

revealed that there are two (2) programs with an amount of P9,967,077.00 that 

were inappropriately included as GAD expenditures as summarized below:

We recommended and Management agreed through the GFPS to comply 

Section 10.b of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular 2012-01 and likewise, 

revise the GAD AR accordingly to reflect only GAD expenditures that are 

justifiable and chargeable to GAD. 

 

PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular 

No. 2012-01 provides a Guide in 

Completing the GAD Plan and 

Budget Template particularly for

“The GAD Budget is the cost of

Majority of programs, projects and activities in the GAD plan and budget 

were not implemented or partially implemented as of the end of the year 

despite the GAD budget being nearly utilized up to 95.00 percent or P606.666 

million. 

 

Comparative analysis of the submitted Annual GAD AR for FY 2020 with the 

MMDA’s GPB for 2020 revealed that of the 24 GAD planned programs/projects, 

only eight (8) or 33.33 percent were completely implemented, three (3) or 12.5 

percent were partially implemented, 11 or 45.83 percent were not implemented 

at all and two (2) or 8.33 percent with no status or actual output indicated. The

LRRs Observations and Recommendations  

activity should be estimated by 

object of expenditure 

low accomplishment was mainly due to the pandemic and implementation of 

strict protocols on face-to-face activities. 

 

It was noted, however, that even if majority of the projects were not implemented, 

the GAD budget was nearly utilized with an amount of P606,666,166.38 or 95.00 

percent of the total budget amounting to P638,837,599.67.  

 

This is an indicative that expenditures were charged to GAD funds even if these 

were not assessed as GAD-related. In addition, there were programs implemented 

that were not included in the approved GPBs or with zero budget allotted but with 

corresponding expenditures. 

 

Based on the review of submitted supporting documents to the Audit Team, not 

all reported GAD expenditures were justified or provided with appropriate details 

to facilitate the audit and validation of amounts. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed through the GFPS to:  

 

a) re-assess the identified GAD issues, to include practical activities and 
programs that are essential yet doable within the available timelines;  

 

b) require the Heads of implementing departments/offices to ensure that 
GAD programs, projects and activities are implemented as planned to 

attain the GAD objectives; 

 

c) facilitate the appropriate revision of the GAD AR to update the status of 
the programs with no stated accomplishments/ identify the reasons for 

non-implementation; and 

 

d) provide the details of expenditures to support the actual figures 
presented in the budget utilization in the GAD AR. 

 

Programs/Projects for Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) 

Section 32 of the General 

Provisions of the GAA for FY 

2020, or RA No. 11465 states that 

“All agencies of the government 

shall formulate plans, programs 

and projects intended to address 

the concerns of senior citizens 

(SCs) and persons with disability 

(PWDs), insofar as it relates to 

their mandated functions, and 

integrate the same in their regular 

activities. Moreover, all 

government infrastructures and 

facilities shall provide 

architectural or structural features, 

designs and facilities that will 

reasonably enhance the mobility, 

safety and welfare of persons with 

disability pursuant to Batas 

The Agency was able to formulate the Plan and integrate in its total budget 

the amount of P41.500 million to address the concerns of SCs and PWDs but 

majority of the programs/projects in the Plan were not implemented 

considering that actual disbursements already exceeded the budget by 

P38.444 million or 92.64 percent thereof as of year-end. Moreover, 

insufficient infrastructure and facility-related programs were accomplished 

and indicated in the Plan to address the concerns of SCs and PWDs during 

the year.   

 

Audit revealed that out of the targeted 12 projects/programs in the MMDA’s plan 

and budget for the year to address the concerns of SCs and PWDs, only four (4) 

projects were implemented while eight (8) were not implemented at all thus, 

despite that the integrated disbursements of the fund exceeded the budgeted 

amount.  

 

Majority of the actual disbursements presented in the Accomplishment Report 

were attributable to the amount of salaries and wages of senior citizens and 

differently-abled persons and the actual expenditures exceeded the budget by 

P40,073,458.00 or almost 200 percent of the budget due to the increase in the 

number of senior citizens hired by the agency for the year to augment the

LRRs Observations and Recommendations  

Pambansa Blg. 344 and R.A No. 

7277, as amended. 

deficiencies in manpower from different unit offices of MMDA. However, the 

audit team could not validate the figures reported for actual expenditures 

attributed to the increased salaries and wages as incomplete documents were 

submitted.  

 

On an interview with the Head of the Focal Committee, it was disclosed that the 

resulting expenditure they present under the amount of salaries and wages is 

based from approximate analysis and estimate by securing the list of Senior 

Citizen and PWDs employed by the agency for the year and their positions 

multiplied by the appropriate salary grades per the Department of Budget and 

Management (DBM) Modified Salary Schedule for CY 2020 (First Tranche) and 

based on standard working days per month and per year, as they are having 

difficulty securing actual figures from the Administrative Division due to their 

workloads. As a result, the figures presented may not be accurate and reliable. 

Further inquiry also revealed that inadequate participation of the other members 

of the committee and lack of designation of concerned personnel from the 

Administrative and Finance Service as official members of the committee, 

contributes to the poor planning and reporting process, including inaccurate 

budget formulation and reporting of expenditures. 

 

It was also noted that aside from one footbridge rehabilitated and the retrofitted 

street lightings, there were no other facility-related programs/projects included 

nor accomplished in the Plan.  Review of the copy of the Minutes of Meeting of 

the Focal Committee dated February 21, 2020, the need for additional facility-

related programs was recognized by the Focal Committee such as, installation of 

handrails along MMDA stairways and construction of ramps. However, none of 

these were included in the annual plan and accomplishment for the year. 

 

Moreover, the Agency failed to improve its crafted Annual Plan and Budget for 

CY 2020 despite prior years audit recommendations on the Performance 

Indicators/Targets which need to be more specific, measurable and time-bound; 

and to include any uncertainties in the annual plan and budget statements. 

 

The above issues show that the annual plan and budget did not fully reflect the 

objectives and desired outcomes to fully address the concerns of the Senior 

Citizens and PWDs employed by the agency. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed, through the Senior Citizen and 

PWD Focal Point Committee, to:  

 

a) require the enhanced coordination among the heads of implementing 
departments/offices of the agency and ensure that P/P/As are 

implemented as planned to attain the objectives as outlined in their 

annual plan and budget; 

 

b) re-assess the identified issues and activities, in coordination with the 
implementing and operational offices of the agency, to consider the 

inclusion of facility-related programs and those projects that are 

essential and doable within the available timelines and budget allocation;  

 

c) provide a detailed schedule and computation together with the 
disbursement vouchers and   supporting documents necessary to validate 

the actual expenditures of salaries and wages of SCs and PWDs including 



54 
 

LRRs Observations and Recommendations  

the cost pertaining to pedestrian footbridge completely repaired and 

rehabilitated and retrofitting of street lightings as presented in the 

Accomplishment Report in coordination with the concerned offices; 

 

d) consider the restructuring of the present Committee and designation of 
concerned personnel from the Administrative and Finance Service to 

enhance planning and reporting process and to ensure the reliability and 

accuracy of reports; and 

 

e) resolve any uncertainties in the plan and budget statements and by 
making the Performance Indicators and Targets specific, measurable 

and time-bound to ensure alignment of issues, objectives and activities.   

 

Management Comments: 

 

Indeed, only four (4) out of eight (8) identified projects were implemented in CY 

2020 because majority of SCs employed by MMDA were on a Work From Home 

arrangement during community quarantine brought about by the pandemic. 

Senior Citizens slowly started reporting to work physically only around October 

2020 using alternative work arrangement. 

 

However, despite non-implementation of the four projects, actual disbursement 

exceeded the budget by P38.44 million or by 92.64 percent mainly because the 

number of SCs and DAP employed in year 2020 increased compared to 2019. RA 

No. 9994 of the Expanded Senior Citizen Act does not limit the number of senior 

citizen to be employed in the government as long as the senior citizen has the 

capacity and desire for work and can be re-employed, he can be a productive 

member of the society. Thus, MMDA has set no limit as to the number of SCs to 

be employed.  

 

Management accepted the recommendation to reconstitute/restructure the 

membership of the focal committee to include members from all operating units 

of MMDA in order to enhance planning and implementation process and 

members from the Administrative and Finance Service and ensure reliability and 

accuracy of funding and expenditure reports. Restructuring of the Committee will 

address the following gaps: 

 

1. coordination among MMDA offices; 
2. assessment of programs to include more client-based and facility related 

programs; 

3. validation of disbursement and actual expenditures with necessary 
supporting documents; and 

4. improve annual plan and budget with more specific, measurable and 
time bound performance indicators and targets discussed and 

deliberated by all concerned offices and units of MMDA. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

Although the law does not explicitly state any limitation on hiring the basis of 

employees’ age but on the basis of the service they provide, the Audit Team 

suggested that Management must also take into consideration that the positions 

to be given to the senior and differently abled-person are just and appropriate for 

their age and physical conditions. 



55 
 

LRRs Observations and Recommendations  

 

On the other hand, the re-assessment of issues and activities as well as other 

findings will be further validated in the succeeding audit, such as if the Focal 

Committee will be able to consider projects that are beneficial, essential and 

doable and that the reconstitution/restructuring of the Focal Committee will be 

implemented so that the gaps on current controls will be resolved. 

  

Compliance with Philippine Youth Development Plan 

Section 33 of the General 

Provisions of the GAA for FY 

2020 or RA No. 11465 provides 

that “All agencies of the 

government, including 

government owned and controlled 

corporations, shall provide 

allocation for youth development 

projects and activities, which shall 

include government internship 

opportunities, within the 

framework of the Philippine Youth 

Development Plan (2017-2022). 

 

The Philippine Youth 

Development Plan (PYDP) 2017-

2022 is a participation-focused 

plan, developed with the 

participation of various 

stakeholders to enable, ensure and 

promote the rights and welfare of 

the Filipino youth which focuses 

on the nine centers such as health, 

education, economic 

empowerment, social inclusion 

and equity, peace-building and 

security, governance, active 

citizenship, environment and 

global mobility. For Health 

Strategy 1 of PYDP 2017-2022 or 

ensure youth participation in 

healthy living and prevention of 

injuries and accident, MMDA is 

one of the lead agencies involved 

in ensuring the decrease in the 

number of accidents involving the 

youth 

Events/trainings/lectures on road safety and traffic rules and laws, and 

engineering interventions were conducted in compliance with Section 33 of 

the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 and the Health Strategy 1 of 

Philippine Youth Development Plan (PYDP) 2017-2022 where the agency is 

one of the lead agencies. However, there are still other programs and 

projects planned by the agency for the year such as, internship opportunities 

and other programs/activities that were not implemented. 

 

Evaluation of the Accomplishment Reports for CY 2020 submitted by the agency 

revealed the following: 

 

There are 355 activities with 8,510 participants conducted 

seminars/trainings/workshop involving road safety, enforcement of traffic rules 

and laws and engineering interventions for the year but was insufficient to 

achieve or exceed the baseline target of 631events and 144,498 participants per 

PYDP. As a result, the effectiveness of these programs towards information 

dissemination on road safety and enforcement of traffic rules and regulations are 

likewise limited.  

 

However, it is worth to mention that as a result of current and prior efforts, the 

number of fatal road accidents/injuries reported involving the youth gradually 

decreased per review of Metro Manila Accident Reporting System (MMRAS) 

from years 2018-2020.  

 

Further, in our CY 2019 audit findings it, was revealed that the Youth 

Development Plan is poorly crafted and needs improvement as the assigned 

division/unit to handle the youth programs and projects were not defined and the 

specific sources of funding and the expected results and performance indicators 

were also not provided. The same findings in CY 2019 AAR were observed in 

the review of plans and accomplishment for CY 2020. 

 

Likewise, inquiry with Budget Division and Treasury revealed that unlike in 

previous years’, there were no youth hired or given internship opportunities for 

the year under Special Program for Employment of Students (SPES). Moreover, 

audit disclosed that only one (1) out of eight (8) other programs was implemented 

by the agency due to unavailability of participants and schedules brought about 

by the pandemic.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed through its Youth Focal Point 

Committee to: 

 

a) continue to maintain/exceed agency’s efforts, in coordination with 
Traffic Education Division, the conduct of events/ activities/ lectures 

despite that in-house activities are limited. As an alternative, it may be

LRRs Observations and Recommendations  

done through virtual meetings, conferences and events like webinars 

using various platforms online; 

 

b) enhance the APP for Youth by defining the strategic interventions, unit 
offices responsible and their respective budget allocation and sources of 

funding, timeframe, indicators and targets to ensure proper 

identification and alignment of issues, objectives and activities to 

contribute in the achievement of the objectives and outcomes; 

 

c) integrate all agency’s annual programs and projects for the youth and 
establish a strict monitoring of implementation of proposed activities 

toward the accomplishment of all programs and projects at year-end; 

and  

 

d) re-assess other identified issues and activities in coordination with other 
implementing units within the agency to include activities and programs 

that are essential and practical yet doable within the available timelines. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

The reduction in the number of youth beneficiaries were due to the enforcement 

of ECQ and other IATF protocols, specifically, preventing mass gathering like 

field trip to the Children's Road Safety Park and preventing minors and school 

children to go outside of their residences to prevent further spread of COVID-19 

disease. 

 

The following Plans and Programs are targeted and considered to further enhance 

the activities of the Children's Road Safety Park (CRSP) and increase the youth 

beneficiaries of the Traffic Education Division: 

 

a. To tie-up with the Department Education (DepED) regarding conduct of 
Road Safety for School Children webinar within the 2nd quarter of the 

year; and 

b. To conduct "Road Safety Education for the Boy Scout of the Philippines 
all over the country which is targeted to commence by the last week of 

March. 

 

Moreover, amidst the challenges and difficulties brought about by the outbreak 

and surge during the early and latter part of last year as well as the continued 

imposition of community quarantine this year, the Focal Committee was able to 

launch a webinar focused on the topic of anxiety in response to growing need for 

intervention among the youth. However, other program would have to be 

cancelled and postponed due to the very nature and concept such as Lakbay Aral, 

Tree Planting, and Youth Fund Run which are not allowed during the Community 

Quarantine. Further the focal committee will seriously consider the 

recommendations set forth by COA. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

It will be further validated in succeeding audit if Management will be able to 

implement their plans to improve their annual programs and activities for the 

youth from planning to implementation including resolving any gaps on current 

control such as reliable reporting of their accomplishments.

LRRs Observations and Recommendations  

Compliance with Property Insurance Law 

Section 2 of RA No. 656, 

otherwise known as Property 

Insurance Law, provides that in 

order to indemnify or provides that 

in order to indemnify or 

compensate the Government as 

defined in this Act for any damage 

to, or loss of, its properties due to 

fire, earthquake, storm or other 

casualty there is established the 

“Property Insurance Fund”. 

 

Moreover, Section 5 of the same 

RA state that every Government, 

except a municipal government 

below first class, is hereby 

required to insure its properties, 

with the Fund against any 

insurable risk herein provided and 

pay the premiums thereon, which, 

however, shall not exceed the 

premiums charged by private 

insurance companies. Provided, 

however, that the system reserves 

the right to disapprove the whole 

or a portion of the amount of 

insurance applied for. Provided, 

further, That such property or part 

thereof as may not be insurable or 

acceptable for insurance may be 

insured with any private insurance 

company and each government as 

defined herein shall include in its 

annual appropriation the amount 

necessary to cover the premiums 

for the insurance of its properties 

during each fiscal period and remit 

the same immediately to the 

System as provided in Section 11 

hereof. 

Insurable properties amounting to at least P7.063 billion were not insured 

with the General Insurance Fund (GIF), as required under Sections 2, 5 and 

11 of RA No. 656, thus, leaving its properties at risk of loss without right of 

indemnification. Further, disposed and unserviceable properties were 

subjected to insurance coverage, thereby incurring unnecessary expenses 

amounting to P14,041.26. 

 

Verification of the insurance coverage of buildings and other insurable properties 

of the agency revealed that various properties totaling P7,063,597,322.17 were 

not insured with the GIF of the GSIS. 

 

Despite the audit team’s previous year’s recommendation, it was noted that the 

70 pumping stations amounting to P6,344,396,816.15 and 14 ferry stations of 

P202,842,935.17 were not yet insured.  

 

Analysis also showed that MMDA had not acquired insurance coverage for all its 

547 operational motor vehicles listed in RPCPPE costing P294,876,688.03. The 

63 motorcycles and 27 service vehicles were covered with Comprehensive 

Insurance while 235 vehicles were covered with Compulsory Third Party 

Liability (TPL). With mere CTPL insurance coverage, the MMDA cannot be 

indemnified in the event of loss of the vehicle due to theft/car napping or even 

against damages sustained from floods and other reasons beyond the TPL 

coverage. The remaining 222 operational motor vehicles costing 

P105,611,220.14 were not insured with GSIS.  

 

Moreover, consistent with the Agency’s mandate to provide immediate response 

in times of emergencies and calamities, the trucks and other heavy equipment 

used in emergency response situations are inevitably exposed to greater risks of 

damage/loss due to huge flood water, fire and other perils brought about by 

calamities/disasters.  

 

Verification revealed that of the 241 operational trucks and other heavy 

equipment listed in RPCPPE as of December 31, 2020 with a total cost of 

P518,878,163.73, only 87 were insured under TPL coverage. The lack of 

comprehensive insurance coverage for this equipment may cause other hazards 

not covered by the acquired insurance. 

 

Interview with Transport Division (TD) Unit Head disclosed that service vehicles 

and equipment were insured with TPL coverage only because this was the policy 

adopted by the former MMDA Chairman, continued by the succeeding 

administration. In this policy, the driver of the vehicle/equipment was made 

responsible for damages incurred due to their negligence.   

 

Further analysis of the list of properties insured by the Authority to GSIS revealed 

that there were 26 properties already disposed or unserviceable and still insured, 

thereby incurring unnecessary expenses. An interview with TD Head disclosed 

that the listing of vehicles for payment and availment of insurance coverage are 

processed simultaneously with the list of vehicles to be registered to LTO. 

However, the updating of inventory/status report of vehicles and other properties 

were affected due to limited conduct of inspection as a result of COVID-19 

pandemic quarantine restrictions. In effect, the said situation resulted to wastage 

of government funds amounting to P14,041.26. 



58 
 

LRRs Observations and Recommendations  

 

We reiterated our recommendation and Management agreed to: 

 

a) request funding from DBM and insure all buildings, pumping stations 
and ferry stations owned by MMDA; 

 

b) continuously acquire comprehensive insurance coverage for all its 
vehicles especially the newly acquired assets and insurable properties in 

compliance with RA No. 656; and  

 

c) establish proper coordination between the end user, SPD and Transport 
Division and come up with updated masterlist of the actual status of the 

vehicles in order to avoid payment and availment of insurance coverage 

for unserviceable properties.
