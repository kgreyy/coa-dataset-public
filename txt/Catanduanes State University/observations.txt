 OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)	FINANCIAL AND COMPLIANCE

		

1)	The reported balance of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) in the financial statements amounting to ₱513.06 million did not reconcile with the balance shown in the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) of ₱493.57 million or a variance of ₱19.49 million. Also, various PPEs taken up in the books were not included in the RPCPPE and vice versa.



Section 42, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I provides:



Sec. 42. Accounting and Property Records to be maintained for PPE. The Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like PAR. (underscoring supplied)



The PPE account reflected a book balance, net of Construction in Progress (CIP), amounting to ₱513.06 million while the RPCPPE reported a balance amounting to ₱493.57 million, thus, a variance totaling ₱19.49 million. Presented in the table below is the comparative figures of the PPE account balances, to wit;

Clearly, the Accounting and the Supply Services did not undertake periodic reconciliation of their respective records, hence the variance. This has been a subject of audit observation in the previous audit reports in which the corresponding recommendation remained unacted upon by concerned offices.



The inability of the Accounting and Supply Services to reconcile their records resulted in the understatement of PPE in the books and RPCPPE by ₱55.83 million and ₱56.90 million, respectively, thus, affected the fair presentation of these accounts in the financial statements.



We recommended that Management require the Accounting and Supply Services to cause the immediate reconciliation between their respective records and effect the necessary adjustments in both records.



Management Comment:



During the exit conference, the Supply Officer and Accountant agreed to reconcile the difference. As per record, the discrepancies could have been due to the recorded Investment and Other Machinery by the Supply Services Office. Both the Supply Services Officer and Accountant assured that reconciliation will be made on the remaining discrepancies of the PPE accounts and adjust the book accordingly to come up with reliable records by the end of CY 2021.





2)	Various Biological Assets of the Catanduanes State University (CSU) - Panganiban Campus with a total value of ₱383,050 were not recorded in the books of accounts due to the inability of the caretaker to prepare and submit the reports to the Accounting Office. 



Section 11(a), Chapter 11 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, requires that the Biological Asset’s Caretaker/Officer-in-Charge, upon receipt of biological asset and based on the approved Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR), Delivery Receipt and other supporting documents, record the biological asset in the Biological Assets Property Card (BAPC), and submit copies of the approved IAR with the required supporting documents to the Accountant, who in turn shall prepare Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to recognize the receipt of the biological asset and post the appropriate accounts in the General Journal (GJ), General Ledger (GL) and Subsidiary Ledger (SL) for biological assets.



Further, Section 11(b), of the same chapter above requires that the Biological Asset’s Caretaker/Officer-in-Charge prepare Quarterly Report of Biological Assets (QRBA) containing, among others, the balances at the beginning of the quarter and the changes in fair value of the biological assets due to physical changes such as: a) growth, b) degeneration, c) production, and d) procreation. Submit the QRBA to the Accountant who in turn shall prepare JEV to recognize the gain or loss on fair value of the biological asset due to physical changes, and post the appropriate accounts in the GJ, GL and SL for biological assets.



The CSU Panganiban Campus owns and maintains Biological Assets both for instructional and income generating purposes. However, verification of the financial records revealed that the said assets were not recorded in the books of accounts. The Accountant informed the Audit Team that the caretaker does not submit the required reports to their office, hence, the non-booking up of the biological assets. When interviewed, the caretaker admitted that he was unable to prepare, maintain and submit the required records and reports because most of the biological animals were donated to CSU Panganiban Campus without any document. 



The Audit Team requested for the submission of an Inventory Report of all Biological Animals of the CSU Panganiban Campus, and it is worthy to note that they were able to come up with the breakdown and the corresponding costs thereof as of December 31, 2020, as follows:

The non-recording by the Agency of its biological assets in the books resulted in the understatement of the asset accounts by ₱383,050 and affected its fair presentation in the financial statements as of December 31, 2020.



The caretaker, nevertheless, promised to prepare and submit the required records and reports relative to the biological assets regularly to ensure that the fair value of the assets are updated periodically.



In view thereof, we recommended that the Agency Head require the immediate recording of the biological assets in the books of accounts. Henceforth, monitor the regular submission of reports with special attention on the periodic changes in fair value of the biological assets due to growth, degeneration, production and procreation.



Management Comment:



The Campus Director of the CSU Panganiban Campus agreed to comply with the said recommendations.

	

	

3)		Receivables totaling ₱11.82 million included long overdue and dormant accounts amounting to ₱8.27 million, which have been outstanding for at least two years with some being existent for more than 20 years due to inability of the Agency to collect the same.



			Section 111(2) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 states that:

	

	The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.

	

			Likewise, Section 6.1 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 states that:

			Items 7.1 and 7.4 of the same circular above also state that:

	

	The Accountant shall: 

	

	7.1 Conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis, and validation of the existence of the receivables, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers, and determine the concerned debtors, accountable officers (Regular and Special Disbursing Officers, Collecting Officers, Cashiers) and the source and implementing government entities concerned;

			Further verification and analysis of these receivables disclosed the following:

	

1)		Accounts Receivable

	

		These receivables include current and previous school years’ unpaid tuition and other school fees for both college and graduate students, which remained uncollected. Demand was not made to collect after their due dates due to Management’s lack of regular monitoring.

	

			Out of the total Accounts Receivable as of December 31, 2020, ₱0.74 million and ₱0.63 million pertain to uncollected kindergarten and dormitory fees, respectively. Inquiry from the Accountant revealed that demand on the kindergarten fees could not be made as they were not provided with the list of students with past due accounts. In the same manner that the complete list of dormitory occupants with unpaid rentals were not submitted to them. Receivables were taken up in the books based on the amount submitted to them by the dormitory management and Corporate Business Operations (CBO). For the dormitory fees, each occupant is charged with a ₱600 monthly rental and review of the schedules revealed that one occupant incurred 26 months of arrears. This is a blatant proof that Management did not make any effort to collect the dues. The dormitory management neglected the collection of dormitory fees which resulted in the accumulated balances.

	

			No measures had been undertaken to enforce the collections such as sending demand letters and the like. It must be emphasized that the non-settlement of the past due receivables may be attributed to lack of consistent monitoring and timely follow up after the same were recognized in the books.

	

2)		Other Receivables

	

		These accounts represent due from other creditors with under withholding of tax and intra-agency receivables. 

	

3)		Loans Receivable

	

		These loans receivable have been due from students for over 16 years. These represent receivables from student borrowers who were granted interest free loan under the Student Financial Assistance Program (STUFAP) of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). The CHED has allotted ₱432,000 for CSU and released the funds intended for the purpose in five tranches from May, 2004 to September, 2004. Partial loan repayments were made thru salary deduction for CSU employees who signed as co-makers of students who availed STUFAP loans. 

	

4)		Due from NGAs

	

		These are advances or payments made to the DBM Procurements Services for the procurement of supplies and materials which were not yet delivered due to the unavailability of stocks. Said procurement was made in March, and September, 2019, aging almost 1 year and 9 months, hence, deprived the University of the use of the supplies/materials that should have been long delivered. 

	

5)		Advances to Officers and Employees:

			

			The balance of this account is composed of dormant accounts aged 11 to more than 20 years which remained in the books and Management did not comply with the guidelines set forth under COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. Below is the list of dormant accounts, the nature of which could no longer be traced due to absence of supporting documents:

			The inability of Management to enforce collection of the amounts overdue from the concerned debtors deprived the University of much needed funds which could have been made available to finance its operations, programs, projects and activities. It also resulted in the overstatement of agency assets due to the inclusion of accounts with doubtful existence.

	

			Moreover, the existence of dormant and long outstanding receivables in the books of accounts without supporting documents casts doubt on the accuracy and reliability of the account balances reflected in the financial statements. 

	

			We recommended that Management exert effort for the immediate collection of past due receivables, issue demand letters and closely monitor receivables after recognition in the books to avoid accumulation of past due balances. If the receivable could no longer be collected after having exerted efforts to collect, the same may be requested for write-off. 



Management Comment:



	Management will strictly comply with the recommendations. The Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) for Finance of the University has already coordinated with the Accountant III of the University and instructed the same to strictly observe Section 7.1 and 7.4 of COA Circular No. 2016-005.



	The Office of the CAO-Finance will assist the Accounting Services to conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due and demandable and that cash advances and fund transfers are liquidated within the prescribed period depending upon their nature and purpose in compliance to the above-mentioned circular.



The receivables for unpaid tuition and other school fees for the previous years for both college and graduate students cannot be avoided because of the University policy which allows students to pay either in cash or on installment basis, wherein 40 per cent of the total tuition fees and full miscellaneous fees will be paid upon enrollment, 50 per cent to be paid on or before the mid-term examination and 10 per cent to be paid on or before the final examination. Also, students were allowed to take examinations even without payments in compliance with the CHED Memorandum. Demand letters to be sent to students are also burdensome on the part of the Accounting staff considering the number of students.



For other receivables due from creditors with under withholding of taxes, these will be adjusted immediately from the succeeding claims of the concerned creditors. For the intra-agency receivables, fund transfer has been made already to some accounts while the remaining accounts will be effected by the Accountant once the analysis and verification are completed.



For loan receivables from students, sending demand letters had been repeatedly made directly to the students, however, no reply was received. For those with guarantors, salary deductions were already made and almost finished at the Main Campus. The bulk of the remaining balances were the loans granted to students at Panganiban Campus where upon verification made by the Office of the CAO-Finance revealed that there was no collection yet for the total amount released to students and no demand letters were sent to the grantees. The Accountant of Panganiban Campus has recently agreed, as per instruction by the Office of the CAO-Finance, to send demand letters to the students as well as to the guarantors and request for their consent in effecting the salary deductions.



For the Due from NGAs, portion of the ₱218,139 in the amount of ₱121,108 have been delivered and received by the University as evidenced by the Delivery Receipt No. ROV19-01738 dated April 25, 2019 from the DBM Procurement Service. The remaining balances in the amount of ₱97,030 are still for verification.





 4.	The reliability, accuracy and existence of the reported balances of the Inventory accounts amounting to ₱2.95 million in the financial statements as of December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained due to the inability of the Accounting and Supplies Services Units to completely reconcile their records which disclosed a difference of ₱94,131 compared to the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) in the amount of ₱2.86 million. Also, medical, dental and laboratory supplies already issued to end-user amounting to ₱151,108 remained in the books and still included in the RPCI. 



Volume II of the GAM for NGAs provides for the instructions of the following accounting forms and reports to be used for inventories:



Appendix 57 – Supplies Ledger Card



D. The agency shall conduct physical count of inventories every semester. The semestral physical inventory of supplies shall be reconciled with the SLCs and controlling accounts and Supply and/or Property records. Any discrepancies shall be immediately verified and adjusted.



Appendix 58 – Stock Card



D. The agency shall conduct physical count of inventories every semester. The semestral physical inventory of supplies shall be reconciled with the SLCs and controlling accounts and Supply and/or Property records. Any discrepancies shall be immediately verified and adjusted.



Appendix 63 – Requisition and Issue Slip



A. The RIS shall be used by the Requisitioning Division/Office to request supplies/goods/equipment/property carried in stock and by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to issue the items requested.



Appendix 64 – Report of Supplies and Materials Issued



A. The RSMI is a form prepared by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to report/summarize all issues of inventories (by stock number) during the day.



C. At the end of the month, all RSMIs shall be consolidated by the Accounting Division/Unit for the preparation of the JEV.



D. The Accounting Division/Unit and Supply and/or Property Division/Unit shall conduct periodic reconciliation of the SLC and SC to identify and adjust any discrepancy.



Appendix 66 – Report on the Physical Count of Inventories



C. The report shall be reconciled with the SLCs and SCs maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit, and Property and/or Supply Division/Unit, respectively. Any discrepancy shall be verified and/or adjusted accordingly.



Section 53b of Government Auditing Standards and Procedures and Internal Control System (GAAM Volume III) states that: 



This standard further requires comparison of recorded accountability with existing assets to determine whether the actual assets agree with the recorded accountability. Any discrepancy should be investigated in accordance with existing regulations and appropriate action taken thereon.



	Regular reconciliation between accounting and property records allows the monitoring and testing of the operation of controls and helps detect shortages, losses and identify errors in recording. It allows prompt correction and adjustment of errors and pinpoint responsibility and accountability for property.



Records showed that the total balance of Inventory accounts, as reflected in the GL amounting to ₱2.95 million as of December 31, 2020, did not tally with the balance in the RPCI of ₱2.86 million, thus, the difference of ₱94,131. The unreconciled difference can be attributed to the inability of the Accounting and Supplies Services Units to completely reconcile their respective records and books. Below are the details of the balances of the account appearing in the books maintained by both the Accounting and Supplies Services Units, to wit:

Verification of records revealed that the Supplies Services did not maintain stock cards for Agricultural and Marine Supplies Inventory and Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Inventory. Interview disclosed that the supplies were immediately issued to the end-users upon receipt, with the corresponding RIS. For the medical, dental and laboratory supplies, an inventory is made by the medical services at year-end and the remaining supplies were included in RPCI. This practice did not conform to the above-cited regulations as supplies issued to end-users should have been recorded both in the Stock Cards and SLCs as issuances. The medical, dental and laboratory supplies which were already issued to the end-user upon receipt should not be included in the reported balances shown in the RPCI and GL as of December 31, 2020. Also, regardless of whether the supplies are immediately issued upon receipt, the supply services should still prepare and maintain the required stock cards.



	The above discrepancies may be attributed to the errors committed in recording of the transactions both by the Accounting and Supplies Services Units and the inability to conduct periodic reconciliation of the SLC and SC as required in the above-cited regulations. However, despite the noted discrepancies, the Audit Team lauds the Accounting Office and Supplies Services for coming up with an almost reconciled balance and immaterial differences for most of the accounts. Still, both the Accountant and the Supply Officer should ensure that inventory accounts are reconciled in order to present accurate balances of said accounts in the financial statements.



	The inability to conduct periodic reconciliation between the Accounting and Supplies Services and to observe the proper procedures in recording of inventories resulted in the noted discrepancies and overstated the Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Inventory both in the books and the RPCI by ₱151,108 as of December 31, 2020.



We recommended that the University President require the Accountant and Supply Officer to reconcile the discrepancies between the inventory report and accounting records pursuant to the instructions on how to accomplish the applicable accounting forms and reports provided in Volume II of the GAM for NGAs. It is further recommended that adjustments pertaining to the Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Inventory be made in the books of accounts and the RPCI.



Management Comment:



	The Accountant III and the Supply Services Officer have noted and agreed to comply with the recommendations which are to reconcile the discrepancies between the inventory report and the accounting records pursuant to the instructions provided in Volume II of the GAM for NGAs and to make adjustments in the Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies in the books of accounts and the RPCI.

	

The unreconciled amount of ₱61,112 per Office Supplies records was partly due to the unreported losses caused by the typhoon that brought some damages to the University and the Supply Office was not able to report them to the Accounting Office.



	The adjustments in the Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies in the books of accounts and the RCPI will be made accordingly and stock cards will be prepared and maintained as required.



	

	5.  The balances shown in the Cash Disbursements Records (CDR) of some Accountable Officers (AOs) do not reflect actual balances of cash advances for each month because recording of cash advances and liquidations was not done chronologically and within the month that it was drawn or liquidated. Also, cash advances for payrolls and corresponding liquidations were not properly and clearly recorded in the ledgers.



Sections 6.2 and 6.3 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 requires that:



6.2 The AO shall maintain separate cashbooks for salaries, wages, allowances, etc. and for petty operating expenses. The AO shall record the transactions in the prescribed cashbook daily.xxx (underscoring supplied)



6.3 The AO shall reconcile the book balance with the cash on hand daily. He shall foot and close the books at the end of each month. The AO and the Accountant shall reconcile their books of accounts at least quarterly. (underscoring supplied)



Further, Section 6 (a), Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs Volume I states that:



Sec. 6. Qualitative Characteristics of Financial Reporting. An entity shall present information including accounting policies in a manner that meets the following qualitative characteristics enumerated in PPSAS 1: 



a. Understandability – information is understandable when users might reasonably be expected to comprehend its meaning. For this purpose, users are assumed to have a reasonable knowledge of the entity’s activities and the environment in which it operates, and to be willing to study the information. Information about complex matters should not be excluded from the financial statements merely on the grounds that it may be too difficult for certain users to understand. (underscoring supplied)



Review and verification of CDR prepared and maintained by some AOs revealed the following:



1)	Recording of cash advances and liquidations was not done in chronological order. Some of the cash advances were recorded in the succeeding month or sometimes two to three months after it was drawn. It was further observed that cash advances were recorded on the month that these were liquidated with the end goal of maintaining a zero balance at the end of each month. 



2)	Reconciliation between the Accountant’s SL and the AO’s CDR was not done regularly, resulting in discrepancies between their records. 



These practices are not in consonance with the above-mentioned regulations, thus, the balances shown in the monthly CDRs were unreliable. The AOs admitted their deficiencies and agreed to follow the proper procedures on the recording of cash advances and liquidations.



On the other hand, verification and analysis of the SLs of Advances for Payroll account disclosed the following audit observations:



1)	Some of the entries were not clearly understandable; 



2)	Some of the cash advances made were composed of multiple payrolls but with only one check issued. However, recording of the said cash advance was made by batch, using two or three separate JEV and more often on separate dates; and



3)	Sometimes partial recording of the payrolls is made together with the other cash advances in one JEV. The same is true with the recording of liquidations. The Accounting Office prepared journal entries to take up partial liquidation of cash advances based on payrolls submitted from the Cashiering Services, even when some of the payrolls forming part of the same cash advance were not yet submitted. Oftentimes, the partial recording of liquidations is made together with other liquidations pertaining to different cash advances using one JEV. Hence, it is difficult to trace whether a certain cash advance was completely recorded or whether it was fully liquidated. 



Interview with the Accountant disclosed that liquidations are recorded based on the paid payrolls submitted by the AOs whether they are partial or full liquidations. This practice is not in consonance with the above requirement on the presentation of information in financial reporting and defeated the purpose of providing users with clear and accurate financial information.



We recommended that Management:



a)	Require the AOs to post all transactions chronologically in the CDRs and regularly reconcile their records with the Accountant’s subsidiary ledger; and



b)	Enjoin the Accounting Office to discontinue the practice of partial recording of cash advances and liquidations.



Management Comment:



	The Administrative Officer V of the Cashiering Services and the Accountant III of the University admitted that recording of cash advances and liquidations were not done in chronological order. The cash advances were recorded on the month that these were liquidated and not on the month that these were reported.



	With these inconsistencies, the AOs promised not to do the same mistake again, thus, agreed to follow the proper procedures on the recording of cash advances and liquidations to make the records reliable. Furthermore, the AOs will regularly reconcile their CDR with the Accountant’s SL to avoid discrepancies between records.



	The AOs promised to comply with the recommendations so as to give a financial report that will provide the users with clear and accurate financial information. 





6)	Cash Advances of Officers and Employees totaling ₱0.66 million remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020.



COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 restated with amendments the rules and regulations on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances. The relevant provisions of the Circular are as follows:



Section 5.7 When cash is no longer needed or has not been used for a period of two (2) months, it must be returned to or refunded immediately to the collecting officer.



Section 5.8 	All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year. Except for Petty Cash Fund, the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the cashier/collecting officer who will issue the necessary official receipt.



Section 5.9 	At the start of the ensuing year, a new cash advance may be granted, provided that a list of expenses against previous cash advances is submitted. However, when no liquidation of the previous cash advance is received before January 20, the Accountant shall cause the withholding of the AO’s salary.



Review of the Statement of Financial Position showed unliquidated cash advances of ₱0.66 million as of December 31, 2020 broken down below:

Advances to Special Disbursing Officers

Advances to Officers and Employees

Total

662,499.89



The Advances for Payroll amounting to ₱0.54 million remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020 due to the inability of the payees to claim their compensation. The AOs could have exerted more effort in informing the payees and set a deadline for them to be able to claim their compensation to ensure that cash advances are liquidated within the prescribed period. Advances to Special Disbursing Officers (SDO) amounting to ₱68,449 and Advances to Officers and Employees amounting to ₱57,552 represent advances for special purpose or time-bounded activity and for travelling expenses, respectively.

It was learned that unliquidated cash advances for travelling expenses amounting to ₱36,094 aged over two years remained in the books for more than ten years now. The Accountant informed the Audit Team that they already sent out demand letters to the erring AOs a few years back but nobody responded. The cash advance for travel amounting to ₱16,701 granted to the former Supreme Student Council President remained unsettled despite repeated demands to submit liquidation documents. However, the Accountant informed the Audit Team that the said AO has not been cleared of his school accountabilities yet and was not able to secure school credentials. Meanwhile, the cash advance granted amounting to ₱4,757 was already liquidated as of this writing. 

The unsettled balances for Advances for Payroll totaling ₱0.54 million as well as the Advances to SDO granted amounting to ₱25,000 had been fully liquidated to date. The remaining balance of Advances to SDO amounting to ₱43,449 pertains to receivable from DBM which was erroneously recorded as Advances to SDO instead of Due from NGAs. Entry to reclassify the affected accounts will be made as soon as possible.

The law explicitly mandates that all cash advances be liquidated when the purpose has been served. In case the purpose has not been served or there is an unutilized balance thereof, whether intended for travelling expenses, payroll fund, special funds and other purposes, the same must be refunded at the end of the year. 

The presence of unliquidated cash advances when they are already due and demandable for liquidation is a patent disregard of the pertinent provisions of law and regulations on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances. Considering the length of time that some of these cash advances remained unsettled/unliquidated, accountability for public funds was not cautiously carried out by the AOs concerned.

The non-liquidation of cash advances at the end of the year resulted in the understatement of expenses and overstatement of assets and exposed public funds to risk of loss and/or misuse.

We recommended that Management take the following courses of action:

	a)	Require the immediate liquidation of all outstanding cash advances; and



	b)	Withhold salaries of AOs who are persistently unable to settle their cash advances and continue to ignore the submission of requirements as cited in COA Circular No. 97-002.



Management Comment:



	The CAO for Finance of the University has informed all the Accountable Officers, in which they have fully agreed and committed, that they will religiously observe due diligence in fully liquidating cash advances at the end of each year to avoid the same findings of the Auditor in the future.



	With regard to the cash advances for payroll, the cash advances granted in the amount of ₱380,000 for Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) to students, was not yet encashed during the year but was negotiated on the ensuing year, January 6, 2021 and therefore, no possible risk of loss/misuse of the said amount. The decision not to cancel the check before the end of the year was due to their eagerness to provide immediate financial assistance to the students.



	Cash advances in the amount of ₱156,499 for CNA incentive of retirees was liquidated in the ensuing year. Non-liquidation of the said cash advances was due to unclaimed incentives of some of the retired employees.



	For the cash advances granted to officers and employees in CY 2009 and prior years, demand letters were made but the Office has not received any response and the addresses of some can no longer be located. 



	Advances granted to Special Disbursing Officers had been fully liquidated and reclassified to their appropriate account.



Management assured that strict compliance to COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 and other guidelines relating to cash advances shall be observed and adhered to.



7)		The booked-up Accounts Payable totaling ₱19.71 million as of December 31, 2020 was overstated by ₱11.13 million due to the inclusion of other payables which should have been taken up under their appropriate accounts. 

	

Section 15, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that: 



Financial Statements (FSs) shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses set out in PPSAS.



Likewise, Section 111 of PD No. 1445, states that:



The accounts of the agency shall be kept in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish information needed by the fiscal or control agencies of the government. (2) the highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.



Furthermore, Section 2, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides the definition of terms. For the purpose of this manual, the terms used shall be construed to mean as follows:



a)	Accounts Payable – refers to valid and legal obligations of NGAs/OUs, for which, goods/services/projects have been delivered/rendered/completed and accepted, regardless of the year when these obligations were incurred.



Xxx



Additionally, the Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) for NGAs as prescribed in COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 provides the description of the following payable accounts, to wit:



Accounts Payable - This account is credited to recognize receipt of goods or services on account in the normal course of trade and business operation. This account is debited for payment/settlement of liabilities and/or adjustments.



Due to Officers and Employees - This account is credited to recognize incurrence of liability to officers and employees for salaries, benefits and other emoluments including authorized expenses advanced by the officers and employees. This account is debited for settlement or payment to officers and employees and/or adjustments.

Other Payables - This account is credited to recognize other liabilities not falling under any of the specific payable accounts. This account is debited for payment or settlement of liabilities and/or adjustments.



Examination of the financial statements and the accompanying schedules showed that Accounts Payable had a total balance of ₱19.71 million as of December 31, 2020 with the following details:

However, review and verification of the supporting schedules revealed that the abovementioned amounts included not only the obligations to suppliers for equipment and goods delivered but, likewise included the payables for the salaries, wages and other allowances due for payment to officers and employees and job order personnel, and amounts withheld due for remittance to Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) and Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth). It also included the collectibles of students with scholarship grants who initially paid their tuition fees using their personal money while awaiting funds from their sponsors.



The salaries and wages payable to officers and employees should have been a proper credit to Due to Officers and Employees, while the refund of tuition fees to students should have been taken up under the Other Payables account since it is not an obligation arising from goods delivered or services rendered. Also, the due for remittances to GSIS, HDMF and PhilHealth should have been taken up under Due to GSIS, Due to Pag-IBIG and Due to PhilHealth, respectively. Shown below is the proper classification of the accounts with the corresponding amounts:

The inability of the Accountant to properly classify the payable accounts overstated the Accounts Payable account by ₱11.13 million and understated the Due to Officers and Employees, Due to GSIS, Due to Pag-IBIG, Due to PhilHealth and Other Payables accounts by ₱9.77 million, ₱38,366, ₱95,100, ₱345,858 and ₱0.88 million, respectively, thus, affected their fair presentation in the financial statements as of December 31, 2020.



We recommended that the Agency Head require the Accountant to:



a)	Make/effect the necessary adjustments, through a JEV, to reflect the correct balances of the affected payable accounts; and



b)	Ensure the proper classification of accounts before preparing journal entries.



Management Comment:



	The Accountant III of CSU Main Campus and Accountant I of CSU Panganiban Campus agreed that other payables included in the Accounts Payable will be reclassified to their appropriate accounts in their March 2021 financial reports.





8)	Accumulated unexpended balances of fund transfers from various national government agencies in the total amount of ₱1.79 million as of December 31, 2020 recorded under Due to NGAs account were not properly evaluated due to non-submission of MOA and remained unliquidated/unreturned to the Source Agencies.



Section 4.9 and 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 requires the implementing agency to return to the source agency any unused balance upon completion of the project.



Review of the transactions affecting the Due to NGAs account under Funds 101, 164 and Trust revealed that part of the balance thereof amounting to ₱1.79 million as of December 31, 2020 pertains to unused balances from various completed projects which were not returned to the source agencies.



Further verification of the balance of the account disclosed that some of which existed in the books for more than nine years already. This includes, among others, the amount of ₱214,475 granted by the Bureau of Fisheries in CY 2011. It was clearly stated in the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that any unexpended amount shall be refunded upon completion of the project. It was further noted that some projects have dormant balances ranging from two to four years.

As shown in the preceding table, unused balances of dormant accounts amounting to ₱1.79 million for completed projects remained in the books of the CSU for two to three years. As stated in the aforementioned Circular, the implementing agency shall return any unused balance to the source agency upon completion of the project. The CSU should have caused the return of the unutilized balances to the source agencies upon full implementation of the projects. Keeping the funds idle for a considerable length of time deprived the government on the use of the funds to implement other necessary projects. 



Also, the funds granted by source agencies as fund transfers to the CSU are recorded as receivables by the former and therefore need to be liquidated after the completion of the projects, otherwise, the receivable accounts will remain outstanding in the books of the donor agencies. 



	The continued non-remittance of unused funds when the purpose thereof has already been attained resulted in the unnecessary recognition of liability. The CSU could have decreased its liability account had these balances were fully liquidated or returned to the source agencies.



Meanwhile, the Office of the Auditor was not furnished with copies of the MOA together with the work and financial plans for all the projects. To further substantiate our observation, the Audit Team requested for the submission of MOAs. However, out of the 17 projects funded by various NGAs that were still in the books as of December 31, 2020, only five MOAs were submitted by the CSU, thus, hindered the Audit Team to further evaluate said programs/projects/activities. 



We recommended that the Agency Head require the Accountant to submit the lacking MOAs requested and initiate the immediate return of the unused balances of the completed projects to its source agencies as required under COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994.



Management Comment:



	During the exit conference, the Accountant III justified that for those projects that were already completed, unused balance cannot be refunded to the source agency as the projects do not have terminal reports yet. The CAO–Finance suggested that they will prepare a matrix on the status of each project.



Nevertheless, Management agreed to comply with the recommendation.



	

9)		Copies of Contracts on Infrastructure projects and procurement of school equipment were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor within five working days after perfection thereof. Also, deficiencies were noted on the submitted documents for the infrastructure projects.



COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 requires the government agencies to furnish the auditor with a copy of perfected contracts and purchase orders together with the supporting documents for review. Section 3.1.1 of the mentioned Circular provides as follows:



Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all documents forming part thereof be reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned. x x x

It can be gleaned from the foregoing table that the CSU submitted perfected contracts to COA beyond the prescribed period contrary to Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001. It was noted that the delay in the submission of contracts ranged from 12 to 41 days and some contracts were not yet submitted to the Audit Team.



The delay and non-submission of contracts precluded the Auditor from conducting timely review and evaluation of the contracts and supporting documents, thus, deficiencies noted on the contracts submitted were not corrected on time.



Results of auditorial review on some contracts for infrastructure projects showed the following deficiencies: 



1)	The Performance Security and Indemnity Agreement posted for the project Completion of Entrep Building were not accomplished with the name of the implementing agency, the amounts of premium paid and the period covered, thereby, casting doubt on the validity of the posted bonds.



2)	The submitted Statement of all completed and on-going government and private contracts including the awarded contracts but not yet started by the bidders disclosed the following:



a)	The information as to the date awarded, started and completed projects were not provided by the bidder for the Repair/Rehabilitation/Retrofitting of Laboratory Building, CAS. Only the date of award was stated on the project. 



b)	The statement of work accomplished duly accepted by the procuring entity were not submitted by the bidders as proof of the actual percentage of accomplishment, hence, the outstanding value of the projects could not be validated on the projects, Completion of Entrep Building and Repair/ Rehabilitation/Retrofitting of Laboratory Building, CAS.



The foregoing deficiencies showed that the Bids and Award Committee (BAC) and Technical Working Group (TWG) were not able to fully verify, validate and ascertain the statements and documents submitted by the bidders.



We recommended that the Agency Head:



a)	 Direct the Procurement Officer or the Supply Officer to furnish the Auditor with a copy of contracts/purchase orders, together with the required supporting documents, within five working days from the perfection of the contract for review and evaluation pursuant to COA Circular Nos. 2009-001 and 2012-001; and



b)	Require the BAC and TWG to meticulously verify and validate all documents and statements submitted by the bidders during the bid evaluation and post-qualification activities. 



Management Comment:



Management acceded with the audit observation and agreed to comply with the recommendation. They reasoned out that the two newly designated BAC Secretaries were not yet aware of the regulation on the submission of copies of contracts/purchase orders within the prescribed period, hence, this deficiency. The BAC Chairperson assured that they will comply with the said recommendation by utilizing all means in accordance with RA No. 9184.





10. The Agency did not take action on the contract agreements entered into by the University for various infrastructure projects amounting to ₱293.26 million despite the inability of the contractors to complete them on time. 

	

Section 8.4 of Annex E of the 2016 R-IRR of RA No. 9184 provides that:



In case that the delay in the completion of the work exceeds a time duration equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the specified contract time plus any time extension duly granted to the contractor, the procuring entity concerned may rescind the contract, forfeit the contractor’s performance security and takeover the prosecution of the project or award the same to qualified contractor through negotiated contract.



Section IV, Item A.2 of Annex I of 2016 R-IRR of RA No. 9184 provides that:



The Procuring Entity shall terminate a contract for default when any of the following conditions attend its implementation:



a)	Due to the contractor’s fault and while the project is on-going, it has incurred negative slippage of fifteen percent (15%) or more in accordance with Presidential Decree 1870;



b)	Due to the contractor’s fault and after the contract time has expired, it has incurred a negative slippage of ten percent (10%) or more in the completion of the work; xxx



Section 39.3 of the 2016 R-IRR of RA No. 9184 provides that:



The performance security shall be denominated in Philippine Pesos and posted in favor of the Procuring Entity, which shall be forfeited in the event it is established that the winning bidder is in default in any of its obligations under the contract.

 

Likewise, Item 2 of Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Resolution No. 05-2019 dated March 8, 2019 states that:



2.0 To ensure the timely implementation of infrastructure projects and effective management of the performance of contractors, the following calibrated actions in response to delays in the implementation of infrastructure projects are hereby adopted: 



2.1. Negative slippage of five percent (5%) – The contractor shall be given a warning and be required to: 



2.1.1. Submit a detailed “catch-up” program every two weeks in order to eliminate the slippage and to restore the project to its original schedule; 



2.1.2. Accelerate work and identify specific physical targets to be accomplished over a definite period of time; and 



2.1.3. Provide additional input resources such as the following; money, manpower, materials, equipment, and management, which shall be mobilize for this action. 



The implementing unit shall exercise closer supervision and meet the contractor every other week to evaluate the progress of work and resolve any problems and bottlenecks. 



2.2. Negative slippage of ten percent (10%) – The contractor shall be issued a final warning and be required to come-up with a revised detailed “catch-up” program with weekly physical targets together with the required additional input resources. The implementing unit shall intensify on-site supervision and evaluation of the project performance to at least once a week and prepare contingency plans for a possible termination of the contract or take-over of the work by administration or contract. 



2.3. Negative slippage of fifteen percent (15%) – The implementing unit shall initiate termination of the contract or take-over of the work by administration or contract in accordance with Section 53.3 of the 2016 revised IRR of RA No. 9184 and the Revised Guidelines for the Implementation of Infrastructure Projects by Administration. 



It shall likewise take proper transitory measures to minimize work disruptions, e.g., take-over by administration while negotiation or rebidding is on-going.



Review and analysis of submitted contracts and other documents to determine the target completion dates of infrastructure projects and comparison of the same with the project status list of projects/programs and activities (PPA) as of December 31, 2020 showed that 15 projects were not completed within the targeted completion date as stipulated in the Contract Agreement. Based on the Quarterly Report of PPA as of December 31, 2020 submitted by the CAO, various projects in the total amount of ₱293.26 million were not completed on time as detailed below:

14)	Construction of Two Lawn Tennis Courts- Execution and completion of work is within 60 calendar days as stipulated in the contract dated February 13, 2020. Notice to Proceed was acknowledged by the contractor on February 20, 2020. Original schedule of completion of the project was April 26, 2020 but due to the enhanced community quarantine, extension of 48 CD was approved and new target date of completion was June 13, 2020.



A negative slippage of 28.06 per cent had been incurred as of May 29, 2020 with an actual accomplishment of 36.40 per cent which should have been 64.46 per cent. As of December 31, 2020, the project was 100 per cent completed but no final payment had been made due to punch list on water ponding.



15)	Completion of Buildings & Grounds Building- Execution and completion of work is within 120 calendar days as stipulated in the contract dated September 15, 2020. Notice to Proceed was acknowledged by the contractor on September 23, 2020. Original schedule of completion of the project was January 28, 2021 and new target date of completion was February 26, 2021 due to the request and approved time extension of 30 CDs due to typhoon.



A negative slippage of 14.0263 per cent had been incurred on the accomplishment as of December 11, 2020.



Requests for and approval of extensions of contract time were not attached to each disbursement vouchers nor submitted to this Office, hence, verification on the reasons for such request and the basis for approval of extension could not be evaluated thoroughly. Approval of requests for extension of contract time without valid reason may be taken as undue favor to the contractors instead of penalizing them for their inability to fulfill the contract stipulations. Furthermore, it should be noted that in the preparation of the project plan and determination of the contract period, the unworkable days should have already been considered, hence, an ordinary rainfall should not be a valid reason for extension.



Also, there was no proof that the Agency notified or warned the contractors for the negative slippages incurred nor required them to submit detailed “catch-up” program to eliminate slippage and restore the project to its original schedule as provided under GPPB Resolution No. 05-2019. Likewise, despite the incurrence of negative slippage of 15 per cent and above on some of the enumerated projects, the agency did not terminate the contract but rather continued to grant extensions of contract time as shown in the attached Annex C.



 These observations may be attributed to the lapses and inefficiency of the Local Technical Committee (LTC)/Project Monitoring Committee (PMC) to closely monitor the implementation of the work activities of the projects, and their inability to act on noted deviations from contract agreement. Contractors should have been promptly notified in the instance that delays/deviations from the programmed work activities are noted to avoid continuous incurrence of negative slippages and to ensure that projects are implemented as planned and completed on time.



Further analysis revealed that some of the projects which were reported to be 100 per cent completed as of December 31, 2020 incurred delays exceeding 10 per cent of the scheduled time duration, thus, should have been a ground for the forfeiture of the contractor’s performance security as provided under Section 8.4 of Annex E of the 2016 R-IRR of RA No. 9184. However, there was no proof that the agency caused the forfeiture of the contractor’s performance security. Listed below are the subject infrastructure projects, to wit:

Despite the contractors’ default and the apparent delays and slippages, the Agency did not take legal and appropriate remedies as provided in RA No. 9184 such as take-over/termination of the contract and forfeiture of the contractor’s performance security, or even a warning at the very least. 



The delays in the implementation of infrastructure projects are a recurring deficiency of the Agency as it was also a subject of an audit observation in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report. The inability of the agency to take immediate and appropriate actions on these delays resulted in the non-completion of infrastructure projects on time, thus, depriving the intended beneficiaries of timely usage of the facilities/structures and violated the agreed contract period as stipulated in the contract.



We recommended that the Agency evaluate all ongoing projects and take immediate and appropriate action like issuance of warnings, take-over/termination of contract and forfeiture of the performance security of contractors as provided in the 2016 R-IRR of RA No. 9184. 



We further recommended that the PMC/LTC ensure that all infrastructure projects are closely and properly monitored in accordance with plans and schedules of implementation so that appropriate actions are taken against defaulting contractors and corrective measures are implemented on time. Imposition of liquidated damages on completed projects with delay shall be made to defaulting contractors, if any.



Management Comment:



The current PMC Chairperson informed the Audit Team during the exit conference that the former PMC Chairperson refused to make a reply to the audit observation. Nevertheless, he will try to answer using any available data and document in his possession.

 

The PMC assured that they are investing all their efforts to evaluate all on-going projects and ensures that all infrastructures are closely and properly monitored in accordance with plans, specifications and schedules of implementation so that appropriate actions are taken against defaulting contractors and corrective measures will be implemented.



The LTC of the CSU Panganiban Campus assured that the projects have been closely and properly monitored and pertinent documents and reports on the observations made are regularly submitted to the PMC.



Management assured that they will strictly comply with the recommendations of the Auditor as stated in the AOM which are to evaluate all ongoing projects and take immediate and appropriate action like issuance of warnings, take-over/termination of contract and forfeiture of the performance security of contractors as provided in the 2016 R-IRR of RA No. 9184.





1)	The former BAC awarded the contract for the Completion of Ladies Dormitory amounting to ₱43.90 million to a bidder who was disqualified in the Post Qualification Evaluation. Also, the observed procedural lapses cast doubt on the bidding process adopted. 



Section 34 of the R-IRR of RA No. 9184 prescribes the objectives and process of Post-Qualification.



Section 34.3 requires that the post-qualification shall verify, validate and ascertain all statements made and documents submitted by the bidder with the Lowest Calculated Bid/Highest rated Bid, using non-discretionary criteria, as stated in the bidding documents.



Likewise, Section 34.4 states that, if the BAC determines that the bidder with the Lowest Calculated Bid/Highest Rated Bid passes all the criteria for post-qualification, it shall declare the said bid as the Lowest Calculated and Responsive Bid (LCRB) or Highest Rated and Responsive Bid (HRRB), and recommend to the HoPE the award of contract to the said bidder at its submitted bid price or its calculated bid price, whichever is lower or, in the case of quality-based evaluation procedure, submitted bid price or its negotiated price, whichever is lower.



On the other hand, Section 34.5 states that, if, however, the BAC determines that the bidder with LCB/HRB fails the criteria for post-qualification, it shall immediately notify the said bidder in writing of its post-disqualification and the grounds for it. (underscoring supplied)

 

Section 34.6 requires that, immediately after the BAC has notified the first bidder of its post-disqualification, and notwithstanding any pending request for reconsideration thereof, the BAC shall initiate and complete the same post-qualification process on the bidder with the second Lowest Calculated Bid/Highest Rated Bid. If the second bidder passes the post-qualification, and provided that the request for reconsideration of the first bidder has been denied, the second bidder shall be post-qualified as the bidder with the LCRB or HRRB.



Further, Section 34.7 states that, if the second bidder, however, fails the post-qualification, the procedure for post-qualification shall be repeated for the bidder with the next Lowest Calculated Bid/Highest Rated Bid, and so on, until the LCRB or HRRB, as the case may be, is determined for award, subject to Section 37 of this IRR.



Also, Section 3.3 and 3.4 of GPPB Circular No. 03-2012 dated August 17, 2012 provides that:



Section 3.3 	If the BAC determines that the bidder with the LCB or HRB fails to comply with the criteria for post qualification, it shall immediately notify the bidder in writing of its post-disqualification. (underscoring supplied)



Section 3.4 	The notice shall clearly state all the grounds for the post-disqualification pursuant to the requirements or conditions in the Bidding Documents that the bidder failed to comply with.



In CY 2019, the Agency entered into a contract with Contractor A for the Completion of Ladies Dormitory with a contract price amounting to ₱43.90 million. Examination of documents disclosed that Contractor B was the lowest calculated bidder with a calculated bid amount of ₱39.86 million, but later disqualified during the post qualification evaluation on December 19, 2018 on the ground that said bidder was found out to have several undisclosed on-going projects. However, there was no evidence that the BAC sent a disqualification notice to said bidder, as required.



The BAC then proceeded to conduct post qualification evaluation of Contractor A, the second lowest calculated bidder, on January 16, 2019. The same was disqualified for the reason that the bidder had incurred negative slippage on ongoing projects with the Department of Public Works and Highways’ Infrastructure Program as of December 31, 2018 aside from the unaccomplished infrastructure projects upon expiration of the contract with the CSU. The BAC alleged that on January 29, 2019 Contractor A filed a request for reconsideration with regard to its disqualification. There was no proof that the BAC sent disqualification notice to this bidder and that they received any written Request for Reconsideration thereof. 



The pertinent provisions of RA No. 9184 require that in case the second lowest bidder fails the post-qualification evaluation, the procedure for post-qualification shall be repeated for the bidder with the next lowest calculated bid, notwithstanding any request for reconsideration thereof from the previously disqualified bidders, until the LCRB or HRRB, as the case may be, is determined for award.



On February 4, 2019, the BAC favorably acted on the alleged request for reconsideration filed by Contractor A as evidenced by BAC Resolution No. 037 s. 2019 and a notice of post-qualification dated February 5, 2019 signed by the BAC Chairperson and received by the bidder on February 8, 2019. The BAC did not proceed to the post-qualification evaluation of the third Lowest Calculated Bidder as required under Section 34.7 of RA No. 9184, giving undue advantage to Contractor A and depriving the other bidders of a fair chance in the bidding process. 



The Notices of Post-disqualification as well as the request for reconsideration which should have formed part of the post-qualification documents were not attached to support the contract submitted to this office for contract review. To further substantiate this observation, the Audit Team requested for copies of the Notices of Disqualification sent to the bidders as well as the Request for Reconsideration from Contractor A. However, the BAC was unable to provide these documents. This can be construed that the BAC did not send post-disqualification notices to the bidders. 



The BAC’s inability to send the written notice deprived the bidder with the Lowest Calculated Bid of its right to file a request for reconsideration on its disqualification. On the other hand, without a post-disqualification notice sent to the Contractor A, it is questionable how this bidder learned of its post-disqualification and acted on it by sending a request for reconsideration, as alleged by the BAC. Also, the absence of a written Request for Reconsideration from Contractor A showed that the BAC favored this bidder by awarding the contract and acting favorably on an alleged request that never existed.



Further verification showed that the BAC was unable to clearly and sufficiently provide the details of the grounds for post-disqualification of both first and second LCRB. It should have cited the specific undisclosed on-going projects of Contractor B as well as the particular infrastructure projects of Contractor A which incurred negative slippage and which were not completed upon expiration of the contract. In the same manner that the BAC should have clearly and sufficiently provided the grounds and reasons for coming up with a favorable action on the request for reconsideration of Contractor A. 



The afore-mentioned observed procedural lapses cast doubt on the bidding process and provided undue advantage to the winning bidder, hence, the award of contract may not be warranted and disadvantageous to the government.



We recommended that the Agency Head require the former BAC Chairperson and former Head of BAC Secretariat to submit a written explanation/justification in response to the observed procedural lapses and the reason/s for the award of the contract to the bidder who was previously post-disqualified for further evaluation in audit.



Management Comment:

The former BAC Chairperson and BAC Secretariat explained that the bidding for the Completion of Ladies Dormitory was conducted on December 5, 2018. During the bidding, Contractor B was the lowest bidder. But during the evaluation of its technical, legal and financial documents, the said bidder was post disqualified under Section 23.1,iv of Technical documents under Class A Documents of the R-IRR of RA No. 9184.

The BAC, thru its BAC Secretariat sent a disqualification notice to the bidder in which the basis of its disqualification was stated in the Notice of Post Disqualification.



The BAC, then proceeded to post-qualification evaluation to the next lowest calculated bidder which is Contractor A. On January 25, 2019, a Notice of Post-Disqualification was sent to Contractor A stating therein the basis of their disqualification. Relative to this, Contractor A filed its Motion for Reconsideration (MR) on January 29, 2019.



In accordance with Section 55.1 of the R-IRR of RA No. 9184, Contractor A filed a motion for reconsideration claiming that negative slippage for on-going projects as reported by Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) do not warrant its disqualification, as provided under Section 34.3.b.ii of the IRR. Moreover, the said contractor also claimed that the project was already 100 per cent completed as of the date of bidding and the delays in the implementation of the projects were not entirely due to their fault or negligence. The MR was referred by the BAC Chairman to the TWG for Infrastructure, the Technical Planning Committee (TPC), and the PMC for verification, comments and recommendations.



On February 4, 2019, the BAC conducted a meeting to evaluate the MR filed by Contractor A with the presence of the members of the TWG for Infrastructure and TPC. The TWG and TPC recommended a favorable consideration of the request based on the results of their verification and evaluation.



During the meeting, the BAC was able to ascertain the following:



	a)	The negative slippage for on-going projects of Contractor A with DPWH as shown in the attached documents are below 10 per cent. Section 34.3b,ii.a under Technical Requirements of the R-IRR of RA No. 9184 requires disqualification of a bidder with negative slippage of at least 15 per cent  in anyone project, or a negative slippage of at least 10 per cent  in each two or more contracts, if these are verified to be due to the contractor’s fault or negligence;



	b)	As of the time of bidding, the project Completion of CBA Building Phase IV and Construction of Hostel contracted by CSU with Contractor A were already 100 per cent satisfactorily completed on October 15, 2018, as reported by the PMC Statement of Work Accomplished and Final Inspection Report;



	c)	Both the TPC and PMC agreed that the delays in the implementation of the project were not entirely due to the fault or negligence of the contractor. It was pointed out that there were issues that surfaced during the implementation of the projects which were not anticipated during the planning stage and that there were delays in coming up with final decisions regarding certain works/activities in the projects;



	d)	Before and at the time the BAC declared Contractor A as LCRB and recommended the awarding of the project Completion of Ladies Dormitory hereto, there were no verified reports of any substandard work or defects in the above-mentioned projects.



Considering the matter, the BAC’s favorable action on the MR filed by Contractor A was made in accordance with the provisions of RA No. 9184 and its IRR, and was done in good faith, without favoring any bidder or putting anyone, particularly the government, to any disadvantages.



The BAC has always endeavored to ensure that procurement activities are above board and are within the bounds of law.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:

	

While the BAC was able to submit the post qualification documents as evidence that post-disqualification notices were sent and a motion for reconsideration was received from Contractor A, it was unable to explain why they did not proceed to the post-qualification evaluation of the third Lowest Calculated Bidder as required under Section 34.7 of RA No. 9184, giving undue advantage to Contractor A and depriving the other bidders of a fair chance in the bidding process.





12. 	Variation Orders for various infrastructure projects of the University were not submitted to the Audit Team within five working days from their execution, thus, precluding the timely review and evaluation thereof.



Pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 are as follows:



2.0 COVERAGE



2.1 This circular shall cover all contracts, purchase orders and the like, entered into by any government agency irrespective of amount involved.



3.0 SUBMISSION AND REVIEW PROCESS



	3.1 Contracts



3.1.1 Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned. xxx



3.1.7 The procedures and timelines herein outlined shall also apply to supplementary contracts, variation orders and the like. (underscoring supplied)

Records showed that these variation orders were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor within the required five working days from its execution. Some of the above variation orders were attached to the disbursement vouchers for progress payments. However, most of the variation orders do not form part of the progress payment and the Audit Team learned about them only through the Gantt chart attached as supporting document to the disbursement vouchers.



Timely submission of the variation orders could have also facilitated the verification of the Quarterly Report on Publicized Government Projects/ Programs/ Activities.



The non-submission of the variation orders within the required period precluded the Audit Team from performing timely review and evaluation of the necessity and reasonableness of said orders.



We recommended that Management submit all variation orders to the COA Audit Team within the period required under COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009.



Management Comment:



During the exit conference, the PMC Chairman justified that as of to date, variation orders for three projects were already retrieved except for those projects implemented in CY 2019. Nevertheless, the needed document is being requested from the former Chairman of PMC. Also, it was assured of their compliance to the recommendation.



	

13. Procurement of meals and snack and other expenses totaling ₱82,000 were made through cash advances instead of direct payment to supplier, were not supported with the required supporting documents and did not pass thru the usual procurement process.

Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 states that: “Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.”



Section 10, Rule IV of the R-IRR of RA No. 9184 states that:



All procurements shall be done through competitive bidding, except as provided in Rule XVI of this IRR.



Rule XVI above provided the Alternative Methods of Procurement.



Moreover, quoted hereunder are the pertinent provisions of items 2.2, 2.3 and 3.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002 as follows:



2.2   All payments must be made by check.



2.3 Only payments in small amounts may be made through the petty cash fund. Replenishment of the petty cash fund shall be equal to the total amount of expenditures made there from.



3.1 Regular cash advances are those granted to cashiers, disbursing officers, paymasters, and/or property/supply officers for any of the following purposes:



3.1.1 Salaries and Wages



3.1.2 Commutable allowances



3.1.3 Honoraria and other similar payments to officials and employees



3.1.4 Petty operating expenses consisting of small payments for maintenance and operating expenses which cannot be paid conveniently by check or are required to be paid immediately



In the verification of CY 2020 transactions of the University, it was discovered that some procurements were made thru cash advance by the Accountable Officer and paid to suppliers by way of cash, contrary to the aforementioned regulations.



Management allowed cash advances for the procurement of these transactions amounting to ₱82,000. Shown hereunder are the procurements made thru cash purchases, to wit:

The abovementioned transactions did not qualify to be included in the cash advance of the AO, thus, should instead be paid by check in the name of the supplier pursuant to the aforementioned provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002.



It was also observed that these disbursements were not supported with all the required documents to show that they passed thru the usual procurement processes provided in the IRR of RA No. 9184. The claims were supported only with the official receipt issued by the supplier as acknowledgment of receipt of payments. It should be noted that payment thru cash advance is only a mode of payment. It does not mean that the agency will no longer follow the usual requirements if the payments are made thru the cash advance, unless it is thru the petty cash fund. Since these expenses do not fall under any of the allowable cash advance provided in Item 3.1 of COA Circular No. 97-002, they should have been paid thru check and supported with the documentary requirements as proof that the usual procurement processes and other applicable regulations were observed. It was also noted that the payments were not deducted with the required withholding taxes, thereby depriving the government with tax revenues. 

		

These deficiencies affected the validity and propriety of the transactions which may warrant the suspension thereof in audit. Moreover, the government was deprived of the corresponding tax revenues.  



We recommended that Management stop the practice of using cash advance in the payments for meals and snacks and other incidental expenses. These should be paid thru checks directly payable to the suppliers and supported with the required documents showing that the usual processes of procurement provided in RA No. 9184 are observed. 



Management Comment:



The AO was designated to make cash advances specifically for meals and snacks during meetings of the BOR as well as cash advances for the honoraria of members present during the board meetings. The amount of CA was then entrusted by the AO to the Board Secretary who is the one personally attending board meetings and responsible in the incurrence of expenditures related thereto. After which, the files of payrolls and other supporting documents are immediately turned over to the AO for liquidation. Nonetheless, the AO promised to adhere with the audit recommendations.

		

	

14. Procurement of meals and snacks and other transactions in connection with the zoom meetings of the BOR for CY 2020 in the amount of ₱67,370 was found to be unnecessary and extravagant. 



Sections 4 and 6 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 are quoted as follows:  



 4.0	UNNECESSARY EXPENDITURES



4.1 Definition: The term pertains to expenditures which could not pass the test of prudence or the diligence of a good father of a family, thereby denoting non-responsiveness to the exigencies of the service. Unnecessary expenditures are those not supportive of the implementation of the objectives and mission of the agency relative to the nature of its operation. This would also include incurrence of expenditure not dictated by the demands of good government, and those the utility of which cannot be ascertained at a specific time. An expenditure that is not essential or that which can be dispensed with without loss or damage to property is considered unnecessary. The mission and thrusts of the agency incurring the expenditures must be considered in determining whether or not an expenditure is necessary.



6.0 	EXTRAVAGANT EXPENDITURES



6.1 Definition:	The term "extravagant expenditure" signifies those incurred without restraints, judiciousness and economy.  Extravagant expenditures exceed the bounds of propriety. These expenditures are immoderate, prodigal, lavish, luxurious, grossly excessive, and injudicious.



For CY 2020, the Agency incurred various expenses relative to the activities of the BOR, as shown below:

Verification of the above transactions disclosed that the disbursements made were for meals and snacks during the BOR’s meetings via zoom or video conferencing. Said transactions were made through cash advances drawn by an AO which did not conform to the rules and regulations on the granting and utilization of cash advances and the applicable rules on the procurement of goods/services provided in the IRR of RA No. 9184. 



The BOR’s meetings were all done through zoom or video conferencing which means that participants are not required to go to a particular venue as they can attend at the comfort of their homes or any place of their choice, hence, meals and snacks should have been shouldered personally rather than charging them against government funds. 



Scrutiny of the liquidation reports for the settlement of cash advances, revealed that official receipts from restaurants and food delivery services such as Food Panda and Grab were attached, incurring additional costs for delivery fees. It was also observed that reimbursement of the meals and snacks incurred by participants were deposited to their respective bank accounts via online banking. 



Moreover, attendance sheets were not attached to some of the disbursements, or even a screenshot of the computer monitor showing the attendees, in lieu of attendance sheets.



The payment and allocation of funds for the meals and snacks during video conferencing amounting to ₱67,370 were considered unnecessary and extravagant as they were not essential and can be dispensed with. It did not justify the purpose for which the expenditures have been incurred and has not promoted economy on the part of government.



We recommended that Management discontinue the practice of paying meals and snacks for participants while attending video conferencing/zoom meetings. It is further recommended that only programs/projects essential to the operations of the Agency be given priority in order to avoid unnecessary and extravagant government expenditures as provided under the above-cited provisions of COA Circular No. 2012-003. 



Management Comment:



Management justified that expenses subject of the AOM were incurred during the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19. The government prompted to declare national state of health emergency and imposed drastic measures to prevent/minimize the spread of the virus among the public. Consequently, enhanced community quarantines were imposed in national territories and travel restrictions were in effect, limiting or totally restricting travels to and from the National Capital Region and other areas.



The function of the NGAs including State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) such as the CSU, especially its Governing Body, the BOR, was not hampered by the situation, it is thus part of its functions and duties as the Governing Body to convene, hold meetings as necessary and carry out its mandate as required by law. It was thus imperative that it conduct its meetings in any form of media available, one of which is via the Zoom platform.



In view of the meeting expenses specifically for meals and snacks as being extravagant, these are considered necessary and in fact, do not fall under the definition of unnecessary expenses under the aforementioned COA Circular under the prevailing circumstances as declared in the same circular’s Declaration of Policies. Even though the meetings were conducted online, the need to conduct the meeting via zoom was not by choice of the participants, but was imposed by the prevailing restrictions on travel and mobility to physically attend the meeting. The manner by which such meetings were conducted does not however make reimbursement of the meals of the participants unnecessary because the rules do not distinguish where the attendees attend such meetings, as long as the meeting were made in pursuance with the BOR’s mandate, conducted under the exigency of the service and in support of its duties to provide governance, oversight and guidance to the operations of CSU.



Said expenses were not incurred with total disregard for judiciousness and economy so as to be improper. Each of the meeting expenses, if to be validated with those in attendance and the prevailing prices and rates of such meals will show that it is practical, cost beneficial and commensurate to the needs of the participants. These meals were not lavish or luxurious as there were no items or expenses that were extraordinary and unrestrained to the current standards.



The necessity of providing such meals to the participants, members of the secretariat and resource persons who were physically present at the CSU meeting rooms were also dictated by urgent and practical necessity since the BOR meetings usually last for hours. Those who attended online should likewise be entitled to meal allowances, since what should be of primordial consideration is that they attended the meetings in their official capacities.



The physical attendance of those who attended in the CSU facilities was also made for practical reasons. One is to consolidate attendance in the only platform, thus, utilize and maximize the slow internet bandwidth connectivity in the University and two is to facilitate a more efficient exchange of ideas among those physically present without worrying about communication lag and intermittent lost signals with online participants.



In connection with some of the official receipts attached to the liquidation reports which include delivery costs (Food Panda, Grabfood), the prevailing situation especially in Metro Manila necessitated availment of such food delivery services. Food establishments were barred from allowing dine-in patrons and delivery of food was limited to those authorized to render such services personally.



Also, in the COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, it enumerated the government expenses that were considered Irregular, Unnecessary, Excessive, Extravagant and Unconscionable (IUEEU) by way of examples, similar cases or situations. Expenses such as the subject of this AOM are not included in the list of examples, even assuming that the determination of such rests with proper discretion of the COA.



Management also justified that these expenses were incurred with utmost consideration of existing government rules and exigency of the service. These were not considered illegal in nature and incurred with utmost practicality and due regard to prudence and diligence.



The Board Secretary V and CAO for Finance will consider adapting the COA’s recommendation. Management reiterated plea for consideration on the necessity and practicality of those expenses as explained above. The Interim Board Secretary informed during the exit conference that serving of meals and snacks during Zoom meetings was already discontinued.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Auditor stands on its recommendation to discontinue the practice of paying meals to online participants while attending online conference/meetings. While it is true that the conduct of meetings was made in pursuant to BOR’s mandate and under the exigency of the service and conducting the same via online was not the participants’ choice as imposed by the prevailing restrictions, this also means they are not required to go to particular venue as they can attend at the comfort of their homes or any place of their choice, thus, meals/snacks need not be provided by the University. Furthermore, the conduct of conferences/meetings is part of the BORs regular functions with corresponding remuneration, hence, the meals and snacks should not be borne by the government.



As to Management’s claim that the expenses subject of this observation are not included in the examples enumerated in COA Circular No. 2012-003, it should be emphasized that the cases listed in the said Circular are mere examples and does not in any way limit the Auditor in the determination of IUEEU expenditures as discussed in the Circular and mandated by law. 





15. CSU employees who are on scholarship grant were paid Mid-Year Bonus in the total amount of ₱2.94 million even if they were not qualified to receive such benefit. 



Section 4 of Executive Order (EO) 201, s. 2016 provides that beginning FY 2016, a Mid-Year Bonus equivalent to one (1) month basic salary as of May 15, shall be granted to those who have rendered at least four (4) months of satisfactory service and are still in the service as of same date, to be given not earlier than May 15 of every year. This shall be in addition to the Standard Allowances and Benefits under the Total Compensation Framework embodied in the Congress Joint Resolution No. 4 (s. 2009). The existing Year-End Bonus equivalent to one (1) month basic salary and Cash Gift at prescribed rates shall be given in November of every year.



DBM Budget Circulars (BC) No. 2016-3 and 2017-2 dated April 28, 2016 and May 8, 2017 respectively, were issued to prescribe the rules and regulations on the grant of the annual Mid-year Bonus for CY 2016 and years thereafter. Conditions to be entitled thereof are the following:



a)	Personnel has rendered at least a total or an aggregate of four (4) months of service from July of the immediately preceding year to May 15 of the current year; (underscoring supplied)

b)	Personnel remains to be in the government service as of May 15 of the current year; and

c)	Personnel has obtained at least a satisfactory performance rating in the immediately preceding rating period, or the applicable performance appraisal period.



Likewise, BC No. 2019-4 dated July 5, 2019 was issued to clarify the guidelines on the grant of Mid-Year Bonus to government employees who are on authorized full-time attendance in a scholarship grant or program on official time, wherein the fees and expenses for the grant/program are sponsored by the government or a partner donor institution, and whereby said personnel are allowed temporary release from their official duties and responsibilities for the period of the scholarship, with continued payment of authorized salaries and allowances for the duration of the program. Said Circular states that payment of Mid-Year Bonus to the above-mentioned employees is subject to the following guidelines:



a)	The scholarship grant is part of the human resource development program of the agency and is aimed at directly enhancing the capability of the official/employee to perform the duties and responsibilities of his/her position and contribute to the achievement of the agency’s performance objectives.



b)	A scholar who has rendered at least four (4) months of actual performance of duties with at least a satisfactory rating for the period of July 1 of the immediately preceding year to May 15 of the current year, and is still in the service as of May 15 of the current year may be entitled to the Mid-Year Bonus. Actual performance of duties means that the employee is reporting for work and actually delivering the services required of his/her position. (underscoring supplied)



c)	A scholar with less than four (4) months of actual performance of duties for the period of July 1 of the immediately preceding year to May 15 of the current year, and is still in service as of May 15 of the current year may be entitled to the Mid-Year Bonus, subject to the successful completion of the course program and the fulfillment of the conditions stipulated in the scholarship contract. (underscoring supplied)



d)	A scholar with less than four (4) months of actual performance of duties for the period of July 1 of the immediately preceding year to May 15 of the current year, and who was not able to successfully complete the course program or failed to fulfill all the conditions stipulated in the scholarship contract, shall not be entitled to the Mid-Year Bonus.



e)	The grant of the Mid-Year Bonus to qualified scholars shall be subject to the rules and regulations stipulated in BC No. 2016-3 and 2017-2, as applicable.



Also, pursuant to Item 6.0 thereof, the provisions shall apply retroactively to the grant of the Mid-Year Bonus to qualified scholars beginning FY 2016.



Audit of transactions particularly the payment of bonuses disclosed that some of the officials and employees who were under scholarship grant on official time were paid Mid-Year Bonus even without rendering the required period of actual performance of duties or successfully completing the course program and fulfilling the conditions stipulated in the contract, which is not in consonance with the guidelines set under the aforementioned Budget circulars. The list of personnel who received bonuses and cash gift while on scholarship grant is shown below: (See attached Annex D for the details.)

The grant of mid-year bonuses to the said scholars notwithstanding that they have not met the foregoing conditions is considered illegal/irregular, hence, maybe disallowed in audit.



We recommended that Management take the following courses of action:



a)	Desist from granting mid-year bonus to those undergoing scholarship unless they have met the conditions set forth under DBM Budget Circular Nos. 2016-3, 2017-2 and 2019-4; and 



b)	Require all concerned officials and employees to refund the Mid-Year Bonuses received during the period of the scholarship grant.



Management Comment:



The CAO for Finance is amenable with the observation and promised that compliance with the recommendations will be observed.



The Accountant III and the Administrative Officer V of Human Resource Management Services of the University shall be advised to re-compute and check the figures presented by the Auditor and to send demand letters to the concerned employees and/or to prepare possible scheme on how to settle the refundable amount by the concerned scholarship grantees.



Management assured that they will desist from granting mid-year bonuses to those undergoing scholarship in the future.

16. Management has been unsuccessful in the enforcement of refund for breach of contracts by 14 CSU employee-grantees who were unable to complete their scholarship.



CSU, in its aim to develop its faculty, academic staff and administrative personnel and provide them with opportunities for advancement, awarded scholarship grants to qualified personnel. A scholarship contract is executed by and between the CSU and the grantee before the start of the scholarship grant. One of the obligations and representations of the grantee reads:



Reimburse the UNIVERSITY in cash or through salary deduction within five (5) years of all benefits and other emoluments released by the UNIVERSITY during the scholarship period in the event that, through inexcusable neglect or circumstances within GRANTEE’s control, GRANTEE fails to abide by the terms of this Contract at any time during or after the scholarship period.



Also, Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) for NGAs as prescribed in COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 provides the description of accounts, to wit;

	

Due from Officers and Employees – This account is debited to recognize amount of claims from agency’s officers and employees for overpayment (not covered by Notice of Disallowance), cash shortage, loss of assets and other bills issued by the agency, losses in excess of allowable variance between books and volumetric count of merchandise inventory and the like (not covered by Notice of Charge). This account is credited for receipt of payment, write-off and approved relief from property accountability.



In CY 2017 and 2019, the CSU Management sent demand letters to officials and employees who availed of the scholarship grant but was unable to complete the course within the prescribed period as stated in the scholarship contract. The following were determined to be in default and were required to refund the salaries and other allowances received during the scholarship period: (Please refer to attached Annex E for details)

As shown in the preceding table, some of the scholarship grants were awarded as far back as CYs 1986, 2004, 2005 and 2009, which are 12-35 years ago. Interview with the Accountant revealed that not even one of the personnel refunded any amount despite the demand letters. It was also learned that this receivable was not yet taken up in the books for the reason that some of these scholars filed individual appeals. It should be understood that before the demand letters were sent, the Accounting Office was able to determine the amount of salaries and allowances that each personnel are required to refund, hence, these are valid receivables of the Agency that should have been taken up in the books under the Due from Officers and Employees account, regardless of the appeals filed by the personnel. 



The Audit Team requested for the letter-appeals filed by some of the personnel including any action taken by Management on said appeal. Of the above-named personnel, only Employee F requested for re-computation of the refund of salaries and allowances in his letter dated November 21, 2017, in response to the demand letter dated September 4, 2017 stating that the amount to be refunded totaled ₱0.55 million. Management replied that the financial benefits received by him from June 2010 to September 27, 2010 amounted to ₱97,917. However, another demand letter was sent to said employee dated October 24, 2019 requiring him to refund ₱1.65 million.



Management cited in its demand letter that the CSU has to impose the provision of the contract to collect from the defaulting scholars, but was unable to enforce collection to date. The scholarship contract binds the CSU and the grantee, thus, any default through inexcusable neglect of the grantee is enough basis for Management to enforce collection through payroll deduction even without the grantee’s consent. Likewise, there was no evidence that Management sent follow-up letters or subsequent demand letters to the concerned scholars which may imply that default in scholarship contract is not a serious concern. Had Management started collecting in CY 2017, the refund would have been fully collected in CY 2022.



Continuous deferment to promulgate a decision on the violation by the scholar employees of the terms and conditions stipulated on their contracts resulted in the delay to recover significant amounts of paid salaries and allowances. Also, the inability to take up the receivable understated the Due from Officers and Employees account and affected its fair presentation in the financial statements as of December 31, 2020.



We recommended that Management require the Accountant to recognize the receivable in the books of the University and immediately enforce collection thru salary deduction from defaulting scholars. We also recommended that Management send demand letters to all other defaulting scholars not included in the afore-cited list, if any.



Management Comment:



The Administrative Officer V of Human Resource Management Services justified that upon checking on their records, the listed employees were unable to complete their degrees, thus, defaulted in their scholarship contract obligations. They shall be made to pay or refund to the university the employment-related costs and monetary benefits as stipulated in the contract and also in pursuant to Article VIII (Administrative Sanctions) of the University Integrated staff development Program.



The CAO for Finance and the Accountant III have agreed to comply with the recommendation which is to recognize the receivable in the books of the University this March, 2021. Likewise, sending demand letters to defaulting scholars will be made immediately. However, they are still reluctant to enforce collection through salary deduction immediately because of the effect of this to the income of the concerned scholarship grantees.



To address the issue, a committee to be headed by the Chairman of CSU Integrated Staff Development Program, will be created to study/propose guidelines or Work Instruction (WI) on scholarship termination and will demand for payment not covered in the existing CSU Integrated Development Program. They will also meet these officers and employees to discuss the manner of payment that will be followed.



	

1)		The Agency Head was unable to issue an appropriate policy directive to disseminate and implement the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) while the GAD Focal Person did not prepare and submit the required attachments to the Annual GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) for CYs 2019 and 2020.

	

Section 9.1 of Philippine Commission on Women (PCW)-National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)-DBM Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01 provides that: 



Upon receipt of the letter of endorsement from PCW and or the adjusted GPB, the agency head shall issue an appropriate policy directive, copy furnished PCW, to disseminate and implement the GPBs. The directive shall mandate the agency GFPS to: a) provide technical assistance, as needed, to attached agencies, bureaus and regional offices in the implementation of the GPBs; b) monitor its implementation; c) ensure the preparation and submission of GAD ARs; and d) consolidate reports on the implementation of the GPBs.



Likewise, Section 10.4 of the same Joint Circular states that:



The annual GAD AR shall be accompanied by the following: (1) brief summary of the reported program or project; (2) copies of reported policy issuances; (3) results of HGDG tests, if any; and (4) actions taken by the agency on the COA audit findings and recommendations, if any. 



The GAD AR prepared and submitted by the GAD Focal Person showed that the Agency has undertaken/implemented various GAD programs, projects and activities for CY 2020 as mandated vis a vis the annual GAD Plan. However, the AR submitted was not accompanied by the following required documents:



a) Brief Summary of the reported program or project;

b) Copies of reported policy issuances;

c) Results of HGDG tests; and

d) Actions taken by the CSU on the COA audit findings and recommendations.



Interview with the GAD Focal Person confirmed that the Agency was unable to prepare the required attachments. It was also learned that only the GPB and AR were being prepared and submitted to oversight agencies annually. In addition, the Agency Head was unable to issue an appropriate policy directive, copy furnished PCW, to disseminate and implement the GPBs which is vital in the implementation of the programs and projects as it will provide specific policies and define responsibilities to ensure successful execution of the plan and budget.



The inability of the Agency Head and the GAD Focal Person to issue a policy directive and prepare and submit the required attachments, respectively, precluded the Auditor from extensively validating the reported programs, projects and activities, and did not provide assurance that the plan and budget was properly implemented.



We recommended that the Agency comply with the requirements mandated under Sections 9.1 and 10.4 of PCW/NEDA/DBM JC No. 2012-01.



Management Comment:



During the exit conference, the GAD Focal Person justified that the CSU implementation of GAD is based on CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 1 series of 2015, establishing the policies and guidelines on GAD in the CHED and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), guided by COA Circular No. 2014-001 or the Revised Guidelines in the Audit of GAD Funds and Activities in Government Agencies.



The CY 2020 GPB was forwarded through the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) portal on June 1, 2020. The GAD Focal Person provided copies of the endorsed GPB to the members of the GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) Executive Committee for reference purposes dated June 11, 2020. Prior to this, responsible units were provided a copy of the GPB being part of its preparation. 



The Officer-in-Charge (OIC), Office of the President issued Office Circular No. 007 s. 2020 on the implementation of the provisions of CMO No. 1 s. 2015 where the GPB of the University is anchored.





B)	COMPLIANCE WITH TAX LAWS



The University had complied with the provisions of National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) No. 2-98 dated April 7, 1998, as amended, and other pertinent regulations and issuance of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) on the withholding of the required taxes from compensation and other allowances of University’s personnel and on suppliers’ claims during CY 2020. 



Out of the total taxes withheld during the year totaling ₱36.08 million, ₱32.24 million was remitted as of year-end, thus, leaving unremitted taxes of ₱3.84 million. The unremitted balance represents the taxes withheld for the month of December, 2020 and the same was remitted to BIR in January, 2021.





C)	REMITTANCE OF MANDATORY GSIS, PHILHEALTH AND PAG-IBIG CONTRIBUTIONS AND LOANS AMORTIZATIONS

The University was compliant with existing rules and regulations relative to remittances of mandatory GSIS, PhilHealth and Pag-IBIG contributions and loan amortizations.  Presented below are the withheld taxes and corresponding remittances made during the year.

Hence, the correct balance of Notice of Suspension as of December 31, 2019 (January 1, 2020) should be ₱1,913,496.25. Consequently, the amount of ₱1,758,008.21 should form part of the Notice of Disallowance as of December 31, 2019, thus, the correct balance of ND on December 31, 2019 (January 1, 2020) should be ₱6,070,504.13.



Out of the total disallowances amounting to ₱5.92 million, Notices of Finality of Decision were issued pertaining to ND Nos. 18-026-164 and 18-054-101 amounting to ₱31,276 and ₱0.73 million, respectively, while the remaining NDs amounting to ₱5.16 million were all under appeal.
