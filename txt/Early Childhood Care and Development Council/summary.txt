D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the review of accounts and operations of the ECCD Council for 

the period January 1 to December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) ascertain the 

level of assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial 

statements; (b) determine the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and 

regulations; and (c) determine the extent of implementations of prior years’ audit 

recommendations. 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements (FSs) of the ECCD Council for the year ended December 31, 2020 

due to misstatements in five Asset accounts and one Expense account totaling 

₱297,978,421.73 and ₱8,309.19, respectively, which represent 25.46 percent of the total 

Assets of the Agency amounting to ₱1,170,213,819.29 as at December 31, 2020. 

 



v 

 

F. Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are among the significant audit observations with the 

corresponding recommendations, which are discussed in detail in Part II of this Report: 

 

1. Five Asset accounts and one Expense account have misstatements totaling 
₱297,978,421.73 and ₱8,309.19, respectively, representing 25.46 percent of its 

total Assets of ₱1,170,213,819.29 as at December 31, 2020. Due to the significant 

impact of such misstatements on the reported balances of the affected accounts, 

the accuracy, valuation, completeness, and existence of the said accounts could 

not be relied upon. (Observation No. 1) 

a) Understatement of the Due from LGUs account due to erroneous recording of 
liquidation/utilization report submitted by one LGU amounting to 

₱1,000,000.00.  

 

We recommended, and Management agreed, to: 

 

a. reverse the recorded liquidation of the Panganiban, Catanduanes 
LGU under Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) No. 03-2020-12-148 dated 

December 31, 2020, and restore the accountability in its Subsidiary 

Ledger (SL) pending the submission of actual project expenses 

liquidation/utilization reports; and 

 

b. adopt an appropriate measure to ensure that actual project expenses 
are reported by the LGUs in their liquidation/utilization report and 

the documents submitted are correct and complete before the 

preparation of JEV. 

b) Overstatement of the Due from Government Owned and Controlled 
Corporations (GOCCs) account due to unrecorded transactions between 

ECCD Council and Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) 

books totaling ₱127,426,992.22 

 

We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation that Management: 

 

a. reconcile the difference between the books of the ECCD Council and 
the PITC and prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the 

account balance, as warranted;  

 

b. coordinate with the PITC for the timely submission/furnishing of 
copies of the Credit Memo, Debit Notes, and Delivery Receipts (DRs) 

to facilitate timely recording of transactions prior to the receipt of 

Project Completion Report (PCR); and 

 

c. conduct quarterly inter-agency reconciliation with PITC to 
immediately determine the unreconciled differences and promptly 



vi 

 

effect the corresponding adjustments for fair presentation of the 

Quarterly/Annual FSs. 

 

c) Overstatement of the Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) 
account due to unrecorded transactions between ECCD Council and 

Procurement Service of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM-

PS) books totaling ₱144,907.51. 

 

We recommended, and Management agreed, to conduct quarterly inter-

agency reconciliation with DBM-PS to immediately determine the 

unreconciled differences and promptly effect the corresponding 

adjustments for a fair presentation of the Quarterly/Annual FSs at the 

given period. 

 

d) Overstatement of the Property and Equipment for Distribution Inventory 
account due to unreconciled issuances/transfer of contents to recipient NCDCs 

nationwide amounting to ₱169,290,844.25. 

 

We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation that Management: 

 

a. demand from the PITC and recipient LGUs the submission of the 
duly accomplished DRs and PTRs to support the deliveries made; and  

 

b. eventually drop from the books the delivered/issued inventories to 
reflect the accurate balance of the Property and Equipment for 

Distribution Inventory account.  

 

e) Overstatement of the Property and Equipment for Distribution Inventory 
account due to non-reclassification to Information and Communications 

technology (ICT) Equipment and Semi-Expendable-ICT Equipment of 

various IT Equipment issued to ECCD Council personnel totaling ₱87,513.21 

and ₱28,164.54, respectively. 

 

We recommended, and Management agreed, to: 

 

a. require the Accounting Division to adjust the issued semi-expendable 
Wi-Fis to Accumulated Surplus/Deficit account, reclassify the issued 

laptops to ICT Equipment and record the related depreciation to 

Agency’s book; and  

 

b. Determine the persons responsible for the missing/unaccounted 
broadbands and hold them liable for the loss thereof. 

 



vii 

 

f) Error in recognition of airfare expenses amounting to ₱8,309.19. 
 

We recommended, and Management agreed, to recognize the expenses 

incurred pertaining to prior year’s appropriations to Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) account and the expenses pertaining to current year’s 

appropriations to Travelling Expense account. 

 

2. Out of ₱689,020,984.91 total balances of two Asset accounts, the amount of 
₱487,168,034.51 is unreliable due to: a) unliquidated balance of fund transfers 

pertaining to completed projects by LGUs amounting to ₱375,699,831.81, which 

remained outstanding in the books of ECCD Council by more than one year to ten 

years as at December 31, 2020; and b) unreconciled balances between the General 

Ledger (GL) and SLs of Property and Equipment for Distribution Inventory 

account amounting to ₱111,468,202.70. These are contrary to Section 6, Chapter 

19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government 

Agencies NGAs), Volume I and other pertinent issuances. (Observation No. 2) 

a) Unreliable Due from LGUs account balance due to unliquidated balance of 
fund transfers pertaining to completed projects by LGUs amounting to 

₱375,699,831.81, which remained outstanding in the books of ECCD Council 

by more than one year to ten years. 

 

We recommended, and Management agreed, to strictly require the 

submission of liquidation/utilization report of 270 LGUs with completed 

projects for the construction of NCDC, 94 LGUs for conversion, eight 

LGUs for the procurement of security grills and furniture and fixtures, 

and five LGUs for the rehabilitation of DCCs to ascertain the propriety of 

fund utilization, and to serve as a basis in recording the appropriate 

entries to credit the Due from LGUs account. 

 

b) Unreliable Property and Equipment for Distribution Inventory account 
balance due to unreconciled balances between the GL and SL totaling 

₱111,468,202.70. 

 

 We recommended, and Management agreed, to:  

 

a. direct the Accountant and the Property/Supply Officer to facilitate 
the regular review and reconciliation of records to establish the 

correct Inventory balances at any given time and accordingly adjust 

the noted variances, if warranted; and 

 

b. determine the causes of lapses in inventory management and provide 
intervention or adequate training to the concerned Property/Supply 

Officer on the effective inventory management system. 

 



viii 

 

3. The LGUs’ failure to adhere to the provisions of their Memorandum of 
Agreements (MOAs) with the ECCD Council and COA Circular No. 94-013 

dated December 13, 1994 was still noted which resulted in procedural lapses, as 

follows: a) non-compliance with the project timeline due to some operational 

delays, causing the deferment of benefits to the learners; b) delay/inadequate 

submission of supporting documents to the liquidation/fund utilization reports, 

affecting the timely evaluation of the propriety of the fund utilization and; c) 

delay in the submission of the prescribed documentary requirements for fund 

transfer by the LGUs resulting in unreleased checks at yearend to LGUs for 

NCDC construction and conversion to CDC  projects totaling ₱15,200,000.00. 

(Observation No. 3) 

We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations that Management: 

 

a. undertake close monitoring of the project implementation timelines and 
strictly require the submission of the liquidation/utilization reports so 

that demand to liquidate can be promptly made and the erring/defaulting 

recipient LGUs can be made accountable; 

 

b. require the LGUs with slow progress or which have not implemented the 
project and submitted liquidation/utilization reports within the 

prescribed period as stated in the MOA to submit justification for the 

delayed implementation, otherwise, require the concerned LGUs to 

refund the unutilized fund equivalent to the unimplemented portion of 

the project beyond the timeline; and 

 

c. strictly enforce the provisions of the MOA and COA Circular No. 94-013 
as to the documentary requirements upon the preparation/issuance of 

checks along with the liquidation of funds, and/or investigate the reasons 

for non-compliance by the LGUs. 

 

4. The balance of unliquidated fund transfers totaling ₱342,450,591.97 had remained 
outstanding by more than one to six years due to lapses on various procurement 

outsourcing agreement with PITC, thereby, depriving the intended recipient 

NCDCs and the child learners of the immediate use of the learning resources and 

other items. (Observation No. 4) 

We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations that Management: 

 

a. closely monitor the status of the procurement thru the PITC and require 
them to facilitate the delivery of the procured contents enabling the 

recipient NCDCs to receive the same for the immediate and maximum 

utilization by its intended beneficiaries; and 

 

b. require the return of the balance of transferred funds, in case of 
continuous failure of PITC to deliver. 

 



ix 

 

5. The accuracy and existence of the recorded Property and Equipment for 
Distribution Inventory account of ₱61,954,499.82 at year-end could not be fully 

validated due to deficient control in the inventory accounting system such as: a) 

absence of Supply Ledger Card (SLC), Stock Card (SC), and other sources of 

information for making entries therein, contrary to Chapter 8, GAM for NGAs 

Volume I; b) non-conformance of the report on the physical count of inventories 

with the prescribed format in Appendix 66, GAM for NGAs Volume II; and c) 

non-reconciliation of the Accounting and Property/Supply Unit records. Further, 

the incompatible duties of procurement, accounting, and access to assets were 

being performed by one Agency personnel. (Observation No. 6) 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. strengthen internal controls through the provision of specific guidelines 
and procedures, including responsible offices, officials, and appropriate 

documentation for the inventory accounting sub-systems such as: a) 

receipt, inspection, acceptance and recording deliveries; b) requisition 

and issue; c) transfer and/or disposal; and d) monitoring and inventory 

taking of inventory items; 

 

b. strictly require the Accounting and Property/Supply Units to 
use/maintain the prescribed inventory reports/forms in Chapter 8, GAM 

for NGAs Volume I and adhere to other relevant instructions in 

preparing these reports in accordance with GAM for NGAs Volume II; 

 

c. effect the timely reconciliation with the Accounting and Property/Supply 
records against the related forms/reports to facilitate timely verification 

and adjustments of any discrepancies noted; and 

 

d. consider creating an internal audit service to strengthen the internal 
control system of the Agency. 

 

6. Transparency in governance was not fully assured by the  ECCDC when the 
posting and updating of the information on donations, trust receipts, public funds, 

audit, financial  and physical reports, as well as the required ‘Transparency Seal’ 

in its official website have not been completely undertaken as mandated under 

Sections  89, 90, 91 and 94 of the GP, GAA for FY 2020 or RA No. 11465; thus, 

depriving the public of inclusiveness to the pertinent information necessary to 

enforce accountability among its officials.   

  Moreover, this also affected the Agency’s eligibility for Performance-Based 

Bonus (PBB) in CY 2020 due to non-compliance with the good governance 

conditions required under Memorandum Circular No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 2020. 

(Observation No. 9) 



x 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. comply strictly with Sections 89, 90, 91, and 94 of the GP of the GAA of 
2020 or RA No. 11465 and Section 4 of Memorandum Circular 2020-1 

dated June 2, 2020 issued by IATF on the Harmonization of National 

Government Performance Monitoring, Information and Reporting 

Systems; and 

 

b. ensure that the Agency’s available information technology resources are 
utilized to make certain that the transparency and accountability of its 

operational and financial affairs are strictly implemented.  

 

7. The budget and cash requirements during the year were not effectively and 
efficiently utilized, since out of the ₱197,383,616.90 adjusted allotments received 

by the Agency in CY 2020, ₱161,997,551.58 or 82.07 percent was obligated, 

leaving an unobligated balance of ₱35,386,065.32. Moreover, ₱72,701,312.78 or 

32.14 percent of its total ₱226,230,000.00 NCA had lapsed and reverted to the 

Bureau of Treasury (BTr) depriving all of its stakeholders of the fullest possible 

use that can be derived from the allocated funds to finance its approved programs. 

(Observation No. 10) 

We recommended, and Management agreed, to: 

 

a. maximize the utilization of the allotments and NCAs received within the 
period of its validity to ensure that the optimum results and benefits 

derived from the funds would be realized;  

 

b. observe efficiency in the implementation of the 
programs/activities/projects to fully achieve the objectives and address 

the needs of its intended beneficiaries; 

 

c. intensify the hiring of the unfilled COS positions for the Procurement and 
NCDC Project Units through publication of the vacant positions; and 

 

d. present a catch-up action plan including interventions on the programs 
with unutilized allotments in FY 2020. 

 

 

The foregoing audit observations and recommendations were communicated 

through Audit Observation Memoranda. Due to the present situation caused by COVID-

19, the conduct of the exit conference was not feasible. In lieu thereof, the Audit Team 

furnished a copy of the Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations on the 

results of audit conducted for the CY 2020 on March 25, 2021. Management comments 

were incorporated in this Annual Audit Report (AAR), where appropriate.
