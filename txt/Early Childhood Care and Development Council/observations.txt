PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

Accounting Errors and Omissions 

 

1. Five Asset accounts and one Expense account have misstatements totaling 
₱297,978,421.73 and ₱8,309.19, respectively, representing 25.46 percent of its 

total Assets of ₱1,170,213,819.29 as at December 31, 2020. Due to the significant 

impact of such misstatements on the reported balances of the affected accounts, 

the accuracy, valuation, completeness, and existence of the said accounts could 

not be relied upon. 

 

1.1. Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 requires that the accounts of 
an agency shall be kept in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the 

agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by 

the fiscal or control agencies of the government. It further states that the highest 

standards of honesty, objectivity, and consistency shall be observed in the 

keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. 
 

1.2. Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 
National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I states that “The Financial 

Statements (FSs) shall present fairly the financial position, financial 

performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful 

representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in 

accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 

revenue and expenses set out in Philippine Public Sector Accounting 

Standards1 (PPSAS)” 

 

1.3. Likewise, Volume III of the said GAM for NGAs provides for the Revised 
Chart of Accounts (RCA) (Updated 2019) to be used by NGAs in recording 

transactions. 
 

1.4. Verification of the ECCD Council’s CY 2020 FSs, General Ledger (GL) and 
Subsidiary Ledger (SL) transactions, together with Journal Entry Vouchers 

(JEVs) and supporting documents, disclosed several misstatements in its 

accounts, as shown below:

a) Understatement of the Due from LGUs account due to erroneous recording 
of liquidation/utilization report submitted by one LGU amounting to 

₱1,000,000.00. 

 

1.5. Sections 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 provides 
that within 10 days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the 

Project, the Implementing Agency (IA) shall submit the Report of Checks 

Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursements (RD) to report the utilization of 

the funds. Only actual project expenses shall be reported. The reports shall be 

approved by the Head of the IA. 

 

1.6. As of December 31, 2020, the SL of the Municipality of Panganiban, Province 
of Catanduanes had zero balance and the CY 2020 GL transactions of Due from 

LGUs account showed that a JEV No. 03-2020-12-148 dated December 31, 

2020 was drawn to fully settle the remaining balance of fund transfer for the 

conversion of ten (10) Day Care Centers (DCCs) to Child Development Centers 

(CDCs) at the Municipality of Panganiban amounting to ₱1,000,000.00.  

 



31 

 

1.7. However, the status reports submitted by ECCD Council showed that the 
conversion of DCCs at this Municipality is still ongoing. Inquiry by the 

Management from the Municipal Social Welfare and Development Office 

(MSWDO) of the LGU revealed that the liquidation report they had submitted 

pertains only to funds transferred by the Municipality of Panganiban to its ten 

Barangay-level recipients of conversion funds. The amount thereat was based 

on the approved Program of Work (POW) by the ECCD Council, and the funds 

transferred to Barangays are still subject to liquidation to establish the actual 

project expenses, which is required under Sections 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-

013 dated December 13, 1994. 

 

1.8. As such, ECCD Council   had erroneously credited the balance of the Due from 
LGUs account based on inaccurate reports submitted by the LGU. This may 

also be attributed to non-adherence by the designated Accounting personnel 

with the standard procedures of review and verification of the correctness and 

completeness of data presented in liquidation reports before the preparation of 

JEV. Thus, renders both the Due from LGUs and the related Accumulated 

Surplus/Deficit accounts understated by ₱1,000,000.00 as of December 31, 

2020. 

 

1.9. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. reverse the recorded liquidation of the Panganiban, Catanduanes LGU 
under JEV No. 03-2020-12-148 dated December 31, 2020 and restore 

the accountability in its SL pending the submission of actual project 

expenses liquidation/utilization reports; and 

 

b. adopt an appropriate measure to ensure that actual project expenses 
are reported by the LGUs in their liquidation/utilization report and the 

documents submitted are correct and complete before the preparation 

of JEV. 

 

b) Overstatement of the Due from GOCCs account due to unrecorded 
transactions between ECCDC and PITC books totaling ₱127,426,992.22  

 

1.10. Section 6b, Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that each entity 
shall recognize and present its financial transactions and operations 

conformably to accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the IPSAS with 

PAG, among others. Accrual basis means the transactions and events are 

recognized in the Accounting records and recognized in the financial statements 

of the periods to which they relate. 

 

1.11. Specific guidelines in COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 
provide that the Accountant shall: 

 



32 

 

“Section 7.1 - Conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis and 

validation of the existence of the receivables, unliquidated cash 

advances and fund transfers and determine the concerned debtors, 

accountable officers (Regular and Special Disbursing Officers, 

Collecting Officers, Cashiers) and the source and implementing 

government entities concerned. 

 

Section 7.2 - Reconcile the unliquidated fund transfers between the 

source and implementing government entities, prepare the adjusting 

entries for the reconciling items noted, and require liquidation of the 

balances; xxx” 

 

1.12. Paragraph 10, Article IV of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between 
the ECCD Council and PITC stipulates that all damages liquidated or otherwise, 

and other penalties imposed by PITC in relation to the implementation of 

procurement contracts awarded through PITC under this article shall be for the 

benefit of, and belong to, ECCD Council. 

 

1.13. The delivered NCDC contents were recorded in the books of ECCD Council as 
part of Property and Equipment for Distribution Inventory account based on the 

Contract Value plus applicable Service Fee (SF) and Value Added Tax (VAT). 

 

1.14. The Due from GOCCs account of the ECCD Council in the Statement of 
Financial Position showed a balance of ₱342,450,591.97 as of December 31, 

2020. Confirmation of the accuracy of the book balance with the PITC revealed 

a net discrepancy of ₱127,426,992.22. The amount significantly increased by 

₱74,756,735.53 or 142 percent from ₱52,670,256.69 in CY 2019, mainly due 

to the perennial issue of unrecorded receipts of various NCDC contents from 

PITC and the corresponding SFs plus VAT charges in CYs 2019 and 2020, as 

shown in the table below (For the detailed schedule, see Annex A).

1.15. The SL balance provided by the PITC to the Audit Team reported the penalty 
income earned due to undelivered items in the freight forwarding door-to-door 

delivery services of various instructional contents by Front Cargo Forwarders, 

Inc. to different NCDCs in the country amounting to ₱73,095.89. However, the 

said penalty income was not yet reported and remitted to the ECCD Council, 

contrary to Paragraph 10, Article IV of the MOA. 

 

1.16. Moreover, the related costs of completed and ongoing contracts consisting of 
transportation and delivery service and delivery of brand-new Furniture, 

Fixtures and Accessories, Information Technology (IT) Equipment, Stainless 

Steel signage and other NCDC instructional materials in CYs 2015, 2019 and 

2020 totaling ₱120,946,181.00 were not yet recognized in the books of the 

Agency. Likewise, the related SFS and VAT of these contracts amounting to 

₱6,516,052.11 were also not recorded yet as at yearend. SFs are deducted from 

the funds transferred by ECCD Council to PITC based on the Approved Budget 

for the Contract (ABC), of which 50 percent is payable upon receipt of the 

winning bidder/supplier of the Notice of Award, and another 50 percent upon 

delivery and acceptance of the goods and/or services by ECCD Council. Details

1.17. Lastly, out of the completed deliveries of contents noted above, PITC’s SL also 
showed the return of the unused balance on the supply and delivery of the 7th 

batch of IT Equipment for various NCDCs by Columbia Technologies, Inc. 

under Acknowledgement Receipt (AR) No. 0849 amounting to ₱37,855.00 with 

Check No. 70320710 dated December 28, 2020. The said check was not yet 

recorded in the ECCD Council’s books since it was not received yet as at 

yearend. 

 

1.18. These accounting deficiencies could be attributed to inappropriate practice of 
the Accounting Division of recording only the transactions upon receipt of the 

Project Completion Report (PCR) from PITC, which usually took months or 

years after the actual occurrence of transactions, contrary to the requirement of 

Section 6b, Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I on the accrual basis of 

accounting in accordance with IPSAS with corresponding PAG. 

 

1.19. According to Management, the PITC is not furnishing them copies of inter-
agency documents such as credit memo for the interest earned out of the 

remaining balance in the MOA Account, Debit Note for the SFs, Delivery 

Receipts (DRs) and Certificate of Final Acceptance for the completed deliveries 

of NCDC contents, hence they were not able to record the journal entries on 

time. However, Annex A of the MOA clearly outlined the procurement 

procedures, including the documentary requirements/forms which must be 

provided/adhered to by both parties in the implementation of the procurement 

outsourcing agreement. The Council, being the end-user and with the 

Procurement Head as a provisional member of the PITC Bids and Awards 

Committee (BAC), should have enforced/required the PITC to comply with the 



35 

 

required procedures, including submission of the required documents upon the 

occurrence of transactions at each stage of procurement. 

 

1.20. Further, the condition could have been mitigated/avoided by performing regular 
inter-agency reconciliation between ECCD Council’s records and those of the 

PITC, however, the existence of unreconciled differences in the records of 

ECCD Council and PITC at yearend proved it otherwise, which is contrary to 

the provisions of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. The 

Management provided a copy of a letter dated December 3, 2020, sent to PITC 

to initiate the reconciliation of balances of fund transfers, however, PITC did 

not respond thereat. 

 

1.21. The foregoing deficiencies cast doubts on the accuracy and completeness of the 
year-end balance of the account Due from GOCCs amounting to 

₱342,450,591.97. The net effect of these deficiencies could not be accurately 

determined without reconciling both records. Based on the PITC’s SL, the 

balance of Due from GOCCs account of ECCD Council at yearend is overstated 

by ₱127,426,992.22 and the related accounts affected by these transactions are 

shown in the table under paragraph 1.4 above. 

 

1.22. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation that Management:  
 

a. reconcile the difference between the books of the ECCD Council and 
the PITC and prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the 

account balance, as warranted; 

 

b. coordinate with the PITC for the timely submission/furnishing of 
copies of the Credit Memo, Debit Notes, and DRs to facilitate timely 

recording of transactions prior to the receipt of PCR; and 

 

c. conduct quarterly inter-agency reconciliation with PITC to 
immediately determine the unreconciled differences and promptly 

effect the corresponding adjustments for fair presentation of the 

Quarterly/Annual FSs. 

 

1.23. Management commented that they have been coordinating and requesting the 
concerned PITC officers for a meeting but regrettably, did not receive favorable 

response, thus reconciliation of records was not conducted before the 

preparation of year-end FSs. Another letter-request to schedule a meeting was 

sent to PITC on March 17, 2021. They also had requested PITC to furnish them 

copies of the Credit Memo, Debit Notes and DRs to facilitate timely recording 

of transactions prior to the receipt of the PCRs but the Agency has not received 

affirmative reply to date. The Management was also eager to perform the 

quarterly inter-agency reconciliation with PITC and secure needed documents 

to effect necessary adjustments in their book of accounts, thus they are 

diligently following up on requests for meetings and be provided with 



36 

 

supporting documents on the deliveries made to intended LGU recipients as 

basis of proper accounting entries. 

 

1.24. The Audit Team acknowledged the justification of the Management and its 
commitment to adhere to our recommendations. However, it is reiterated that 

the Management should enforce/require the PITC to comply with the required 

procedures, including submission of the required documents upon the actual 

occurrence of transactions at each stage of procurement in accordance with the 

Annex A of the MOA between ECCD Council and PITC dated September 27, 

2013. DR must be available upon actual receipt of items or signing of Inspection 

and Acceptance Report (IAR) and not after years/months of receipt. The 

Agency must also ensure that these documents will be forwarded to the Property 

and Accounting Divisions for timely recognition of assets in the books, thus 

coordination and reconciliation between Property and Accounting Divisions is 

highly recommended. 

 

c) Overstatement of the Due from NGAs account due to unrecorded 
transactions between ECCD Council and DBM-PS books totaling 

₱144,907.51 

 

1.25. Through Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Resolution No. 11-
2017, the members of the GPPB confirmed that airline tickets will be treated as 

a Common Supplies and Equipment (CSE) item to be purchased from the 

DBM-PS, subject to reasonable advance payment terms to be set by the DBM-

PS.  

 

1.26. In compliance with the abovementioned policy, ECCD Council has joined the 
Government Fares Agreement (GFA) and executed a MOA with the DBM-PS 

on November 14, 2018, on the procurement of airline tickets for official travel 

of ECCD Council employees. Initial fund of ₱600,000.00 was transferred as a 

source of funding for the procurement. Other pertinent provisions of the MOA 

are as follows: 

 

“Section 1.1.2 – The relevant budgeting, accounting, and auditing 

rules and regulations and other pertinent administrative issuances 

shall be applied. 

 

Section 2.2.1 – A one percent (1%) service charge to be computed 

based on the gross amount (exclusive of discount) stated in the 

weekly billing statement shall be imposed for services to be rendered 

by the PS-DBM. The service fee shall only accrue to the PS-DBM 

after consummation of the services of the Suppliers. 

 

Section 4.4.1 – The Client shall appoint an Administrator who shall 

have access to reservations made by any Travel Arranger within the 



37 

 

Client Agency and shall be responsible for receiving Weekly Sales 

Report Summary from Sales and administering line of the credit. 

 

Section 4.4.2 - The fund shall be replenished once it reaches fifty 

percent (50%) utilization, or upon notice by the PS-DBM through a 

Statement of Account (SOA).”  

 

1.27. The Due from NGAs account in the ECCD Council’s Statement of Financial 
Position as of December 31, 2020 showed a balance of ₱738,277.57, broken 

down as follows: 

 
Particulars Amount

1.28. Confirmation of the accuracy of the book balance with the DBM-PS revealed a 
net discrepancy of ₱144,907.51 due to the unreplenished airfare billings plus 

the corresponding one percent (1%) SF charges, and unrecorded office supplies 

purchase return, as shown in the table below:

1.29. The SL balance provided by the DBM-PS to the Audit Team reported five Sales 
Invoices (SIs) dated March 25 to June 4, 2020, with a total amount of 

₱147,530.45 on the procurement of airline tickets from PAL and Cebu Pacific 

thru DBM-PS, which was not yet reported and replenished by the ECCD 

Council as of December 31, 2020.  This comprises of various billing reports 

from respective airlines totaling ₱145,909.24 plus one percent SF charged by 

DBM-PS on the consummated services totaling ₱1,621.21. Likewise, SF 

amounting to ₱70.66 under SI No. GFA20-01021 dated March 4, 2020 was also 

unrecorded. 

 

1.30. According to the Management, the SIs, which are their basis in recording 
replenishments, were not yet emailed by the DBM-PS sales agent and the fund 

utilization rate was not yet fifty percent (50%). However, the Agency 

Administrator, who is also the Finance Officer responsible in processing the 

replenishments of fund to DBM-PS, administers the credit line of the Agency, 

and has access to reservations made by the Travel Arranger. This could be 

utilized to determine unpaid but demandable obligations and recognize the 

applicable expense and payable accounts in the books of the Agency prior to 

closing of the books of accounts at yearend. 

 

1.31. Likewise, a credit memo on the purchase return of office supplies worth 
₱2,693.60 delivered to ECCD Council with Reference No. M20-000003-CSE 

dated January 3, 2020 and recorded in the books of DBM-PS on October 31, 

2020 under JEV No. 01-2020-10-146 was also not recognized in the books of 

the ECCD Council. 

 

1.32. Section 1.2, Article 1 of the MOA provides that the relevant budgeting, 
accounting, and auditing rules and regulations and other pertinent 

administrative issuances shall be applied in the agreement. The non-recording 

of the airline billings, service fees, purchase return and erroneous recognition 

of expenses are contrary to Section 6b, Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs, Volume 

I on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the IPSAS with PAG.  

 

1.33. This also showed non-adherence to Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of COA Circular No. 
2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, which provides the responsibility of the 

Accountant to conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis, and 

validation of the unliquidated fund transfers, including reconciliation of the 

unliquidated fund transfers between the source and implementing government 

entities, prepare the adjusting entries for the reconciling items noted, and 

require liquidation of the balances.  

 

1.34. These above noted deficiencies casts doubt on the accuracy and completeness 
of the year-end balance of the Due from NGAs account. The reconciliation of 

records between parties is necessary to determine the correct balances, but 

based on the DBM-PS SL, the Due from NGAs is overstated by ₱144,907.51 



39 

 

and the related accounts affected by these transactions are shown in the table 

under Paragraph 1.4 above. 

 

1.35. We recommended and Management agreed to conduct quarterly inter-
agency reconciliation with DBM-PS to immediately determine the 

unreconciled differences and promptly effect the corresponding 

adjustments for a fair presentation of the Quarterly/Annual FSs at the 

given period. 

 

d) Overstatement of the Property and Equipment for Distribution Inventory 
account due to unrecorded issuances/transfer of contents to recipient 

NCDCs nationwide amounting to ₱169,290,844.25 

 

1.36. Section 7, Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs states that when 
inventories are sold, exchanged, or distributed, their carrying amount shall be 

recognized as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is 

recognized. If there is no related revenue, the expense is recognized when the 

goods are distributed, or the related service is rendered. 

 

1.37. The ECCD Council signed and executed a MOA with the PITC on September 
27, 2013, engaging the latter to act as the provider of Procurement Outsourcing 

Services and/or supplier of the former’s goods and services requirements 

including the procurement of NCDC contents. In consideration thereof, the 

Agency agreed to pay PITC an SF plus VAT based on the ABC of each 

procurement project to be deducted from the funds transferred by ECCD 

Council to PITC. 

 

1.38. The NCDC contents are either delivered by the PITC to the ECCD Council 
office address or directly distributed to recipient NCDCs located in various 

LGUs. The Property and Equipment for Distribution Inventory account is used 

by the Agency to record receipt and deliveries of these items. The debits and 

credits to the said account from CY 2014 to December 31, 2020 are summarized 

in the table below: 

 
Period Debits Credits Balance 

2014 ₱ 9,083,413.96 - ₱9,083,413.96

Total ₱271,058,434.23 ₱ 209,257,918.41  

 

1.39. The table above shows that out of ₱271,058,434.23 recorded receipts of 
contents from the PITC in CYs 2014 to 2019, ₱209,257,918.41 or 77.20

percent, representing issuances to recipient NCDCs, was dropped from its 

books leaving a balance of ₱61,800,515.82 as of December 31, 2020.  

 

1.40. However, the result of the physical count of the contents inventory, conducted 
by the Audit Team and ECCD Council personnel in its rented warehouse in 

Taguig on February 10, 2021, revealed that only ₱14,395,128.23 worth of 

contents delivered by PITC in CYs 2019 and 2020 remained in their custody, 

as follows:

Total  ₱14,395,128.23 

 

1.41. The outstanding book balance of ₱61,800,515.82, together with unrecorded 
cost of contents on-hand and those directly delivered to Centers by the 

contracted suppliers of PITC in CYs 2019 and 2020 totaling ₱121,885,456.66, 

compared to actual contents on-hand per physical count, resulted in a 

discrepancy of ₱169,290,844.25, as shown in the table below:

Unadjusted Balance per books, December 31, 2020 ₱61,800,515.82 

Add: Unrecorded Receipts  121,885,456.66

Less: Total On-Hand per Physical Count 14,395,128.23 

Net Discrepancy ₱169,290,844.25   

 

1.42. According to the Management, the net discrepancy pertains to the cost of 
issued/transferred contents to recipient centers which the Agency failed to drop 

from the books due to PITC’s failure to submit to the ECCD Council copies of 

DRs and Property Transfer Reports (PTRs) for the contents directly delivered 

by the PITC-contracted suppliers to NCDCs. However, it was observed that 

even the contents delivered by PITC to ECCD Council office, of which the 

Management subsequently facilitated issuances/distribution to centers or to 

Child Development Teachers (CDTs)/LGU representatives during trainings and 

conferences of ECCD Council, were also not supported by DRs and PTRs.  

 

 
2 Total of 347 sets but the 32 sets counted were recorded under Textbook and Other Instructional Materials 

Inventory account  



41 

 

1.43. The Management did not give definite answer as to whether the PTRs, as one 
of the delivery documents that the supplier will provide during delivery to 

recipient centers or to recipient LGU representative upon receipt during 

trainings and conferences of ECCD Council, were prepared based on 

allocation/distribution list prior to delivery schedule to ensure that transfer of 

accountability will be acknowledged by the LGU-representative upon receipt 

of contents.  

 

1.44. The Management was able to submit a summary of issuances/distribution to 
centers, however, the said report presented is not duly reconciled with the 

balance of recorded receipt of contents from PITC since CY 2014 in the books 

of accounts of ECCD Council. The total amount of ₱183,809,955.57 credited 

to Property and Distribution account in CY 2020 was only supported by 

individual PTRs from recipient LGUs dated upon preparation of such PTR in 

CYs 2019 and 2020 and not on the actual date of issuance/distribution of the 

contents and/or receipt by the recipient LGU representatives.  

 

1.45. The absence of such documents casts doubts whether the contents were 
delivered to intended recipient centers and resulted in non-dropping of 

issued/distributed contents to centers. Consequently, the account balance 

remained materially misstated, thus adversely affecting the fair presentation of 

the Agency’s FSs as at yearend. 

 

1.46. We reiterated the prior year’s recommendation that Management: 
 

a) demand from the PITC and recipient LGUs the submission of the duly 
accomplished DRs and PTRs to support the deliveries made; and  

 

b) eventually drop from the books the delivered/issued inventories to 
reflect the accurate balance of the Property and Equipment for 

Distribution Inventory account.  

 

1.47. Management commented that they consistently demand from the recipient 
LGUs of NCDC contents to submit the duly accomplished PTRs and sought the 

assistance of non-procurement administrative and finance staff to follow up the 

submission of the said PTRs that serve as the Council’s basis to drop the 

delivered contents from its books. Likewise, the PITC was also requested to 

immediately furnish the Council duly accomplished DRs that may also be used 

to drop the cost of the delivered contents from its books and upon receipt of the 

PTRs from the LGUs/DRs from PITC, the cost of issued/delivered inventories 

will be dropped from the Council’s Property and Equipment for Distribution 

Inventory account. 

 



42 

 

e) Overstatement of the Property and Equipment for Distribution Inventory 
account due to non-reclassification to ICT Equipment and Semi-

Expendable-ICT Equipment of various IT Equipment issued to ECCD 

Council personnel totaling ₱87,513.21 and ₱28,164.54, respectively 

 

1.48. The Monitoring Report3 of various contents of inventory stored in Taguig 
warehouse as of December 31, 2020 submitted by the Management showed that 

two ASUS X407UF-EB045T laptops costing ₱45,846.21 and ₱41,667.00, 

respectively, which are intended for NCDC CDTs/workers, were issued to 

ECCD Council personnel. The Audit Team requested the Management for a 

copy of the Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) and Property Acknowledgement 

Receipt (PAR) to determine the validity of these issuances, but the Property 

Custodian failed to present the documents.  

 

1.49. Likewise, during the physical count, the IT Equipment inventory revealed a 
shortage of 11 M7350 TP Link 4G LTE Mobile Wi-Fi. Management explained 

that 10 Wi-Fis were also issued to ECCD Council personnel, but the RIS and 

ICS supporting issuances were also not available upon request by the Audit 

Team. The ICS emailed by the Property Custodian on March 5, 2021 showed 

that nine Wi-Fis were issued in CY 2020, while two broadbands remained 

unaccounted. Details of issuances are as follows:

Total ₱28,164.51 

 

1.50. The leniency of Management in handling inventories and issuances thereof to 
end-users without the RIS, PTR, ICS, and PAR to monitor and establish 

accountability over the said properties increases the risk of loss or 

misappropriation of the Agency assets. Further, the said laptops amounting to 

₱87,513.21 and Wi-Fi broadbands amounting to ₱28,164.51 should have been 

reclassified to ICT Equipment account and Semi-Expendable-ICT Equipment 

account, respectively. Consequently, the expenses on issued semi-expendable 

contents and depreciation of the ICT equipment were not recognized in the 

 
3 Monitoring Report of Inventory stored in Taguig warehouse as of December 31, 2020 was submitted on 

February 5, 2021 in lieu of the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI).

books, thereby misstating the affected accounts in the financial statements at 

yearend. 

 

1.51. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a) require the Accounting Division to adjust the issued semi-expendable 
Wi-Fis to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account, reclassify the issued 

laptops to ICT Equipment and record the related depreciation to 

Agency’s book; and  

 

b) determine the persons responsible for the missing/unaccounted 
broadbands and hold them liable for the loss thereof. 

 

f) Error in recognition of airfare expenses amounting to ₱8,309.19 
 

1.52. Matching principle of accounting requires that expenses incurred by an 
organization must be charged to the Statement of Financial Performance in the 

accounting period in which the revenue, to which those expenses relate, is 

earned. Also, Section 119 of PD No. 1445 states that all lawful expenditures 

and obligations incurred during the year shall be taken up in the accounts of that 

year. 

 

1.53. Further analysis and vouching of fund replenishment to DBM-PS amounting to 
₱249,104.22, recorded with JEV No. 03-2020-02-007 dated February 24, 2020 

and its supporting documents, showed that the total amount of ₱8,309.19 for 

airfare charges and SFs in CY 2019 was inappropriately recorded by the ECCD 

Council as current year expense under the Traveling Expenses account instead 

of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit). 

 

1.54. We recommended, and Management agreed, to recognize the expenses 
incurred pertaining to prior year’s appropriations to Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) account and the expenses pertaining to current year’s 

appropriations to Travelling Expenses account. 

 

Other Accounting Deficiencies 

 

2. Out of ₱689,020,984.91 total balances of two Asset accounts, the amount of 
₱487,168,034.51 is unreliable due to: a) unliquidated balance of fund transfers 

pertaining to completed projects by LGUs amounting to ₱375,699,831.81, which 

remained outstanding in the books of ECCD Council by more than one year to 

ten years as at December 31, 2020; and b) unreconciled balances between the GL 

and SLs of Property and Equipment for Distribution Inventory account 

amounting to ₱111,468,202.70. These are contrary to Section 6, Chapter 19 of the 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I and other pertinent issuances. 

 



44 

 

2.1. Section 6, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I enumerated the 
qualitative characteristics of financial reporting, among which, are reliability, 

faithful representation, and completeness, defined as follows: 

 

a) Reliability – reliable information is free from material error and bias, and 
can be depended on by the users to represent faithfully that which it purports 

to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. 

 

b) Faithful representation – to represent faithfully transactions and other 
events, it should be presented in accordance with the substance of the 

transactions and other events, and not merely their legal form. 

 

c) Completeness – the information in FSs should be complete within the 
bounds of materiality and cost. 

 

2.2. Various deficiencies in recording and reporting financial transactions also 
affected the reliability and accuracy of the reported balances of the FSs, as 

summarized below and discussed in the succeeding paragraphs:

2.3. Section 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 and Annex 
II of the MOA between ECCD Council and recipient LGUs stipulate the 

required documentary requirements and the prescribed period to liquidate the 

fund transferred to LGUs. 

 

2.4. The Due from LGUs account in the Council’s Statement of Financial Position 
as at December 31, 2020 showed a balance of ₱627,220,469.09, broken down 

as follows:

₱627,220,469.09 year-end balance of Due from LGUs account pertains to 

completed projects of 270 LGUs for the construction of NCDC, 94 LGUs for 

the conversion, eight LGUs for the procurement of security grills and furniture 

and fixtures, and five LGUs for the rehabilitation of DCCs, which remained 

unliquidated/partially liquidated for more than one year to ten years, as

2.7. This deficiency is attributed to the non-submission of the project fund 
utilization and liquidation reports by the LGUs within the prescribed period as 

stipulated in the MOA and pursuant to COA Circular No. 94-013 dated 

December 13, 1994.  

 

2.8. Despite all the efforts undertaken by the Management to monitor and follow up 
thereof, partial, or non-liquidation by the concerned LGUs continually takes 

place. As such, the Audit Team had further issued demand letters to 102 LGUs 

which have not submitted their liquidation reports and other required 

documents despite the completion of the projects. 

 

2.9. The submission of a liquidation/utilization report is essential to ascertain the 
propriety of the fund utilization. Also, it serves as the basis of the proper 

deduction/crediting of the Due from LGUs account together with the recording 

of the related Expense account/s. Thus, non-submission of the same, despite 

project completion, will result in an overstatement of the Due from LGUs 

account by ₱375,699,831.81. Besides, the related Financial Assistance to LGUs 

and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts are understated by ₱13,331,905.49 

and by ₱362,367,926.32, respectively. 

 

2.10. We recommended that Management strictly require the submission of 
liquidation/utilization reports of 270 LGUs with completed projects for the 

construction of NCDC, 94 LGUs for conversion, eight LGUs for the 

procurement of security grills and furniture and fixtures, and five LGUs 

for the rehabilitation of DCCs to ascertain the propriety of fund utilization, 

and to serve as a basis in recording the appropriate entries to credit the 

Due from LGUs account. 

 

2.11. Management commented that they are diligently requiring concerned LGUs to 
submit liquidation/ utilization reports on the fund transferred for the 

construction of NCDCs, conversion of existing CDCs, procurement of security 

grills and furniture and fixtures and rehabilitation of DCCs. The Administrative 

and Finance Unit staff were also tapped to follow up with the LGUs the 

immediate submission of the necessary report and more attention will be given 

for the fund transfers which purpose were already completed. 

 

2.12. The Audit Team acknowledged the response of the Management and its 
commitment to adhere to our recommendations. We also encourage the 

Management to maintain a database/monitoring report which contains pertinent 

information such as date, contact person, mode of communications or follow-

up and the recipient-LGUs’ response regarding the liquidation of fund transfers.

b) Unreliable Property and Equipment for Distribution Inventory account 
balance due to unreconciled balances between the GL and SL totaling 

₱111,468,202.70 

 

2.13. Appendix 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II provides the SL format showing 
by debtor/creditor the detail for each control account in the GL to be maintained 

per account and fund cluster by the Accounting Division. The SL balances of 

debtors/creditors shall be reconciled with their respective controlling account 

in the GL regularly or at the end of each month. 

 

2.14. Review of the total receipts of various contents from the PITC as reported in 
the SL/Status of Fund Transferred to PITC4 and the GL, shown under the tables 

in paragraphs three and four above, respectively, revealed a discrepancy of 

P111,468,202.70, computed as follows:  

 

Particulars Balance 

Total deliveries from the PITC per Status Report ₱382,526,636.93 

Total deliveries from the PITC per GL 271,058,434.23 

Difference ₱111,468,202.70   

 

2.15. The difference was attributed to unrecorded cost of contents on-hand and those 
directly delivered to Centers by the contracted supplier of PITC in CYs 2019 

and 2020 totaling ₱121,885,456.66 and the unsupported but recorded receipts 

in CYs 2014 to 2017 totaling ₱10,417,253.96, of which the detail is still for 

reconciliation by the Accounting and Supply/Procurement Divisions of ECCD 

Council. 

 

2.16. We recommended that Management:  
 

a. direct the Accountant and the Property/Supply Officer to facilitate the 
regular review and reconciliation of records to establish the correct 

Inventory balances at any given time and accordingly adjust the noted 

variances, if warranted; and 

 

b. determine the causes of lapses in inventory management and provide 
intervention or adequate training to the concerned Property/Supply 

Officer on the effective inventory management system. 

 

2.17. Management commented that they instructed the concerned Accounting and 
Property/Supply Officer to strictly conduct the regular review and 

reconciliation of records. The causes of lapses in inventory management will 

be determined and the concerned personnel will be provided with adequate 

training on the effective inventory management system.

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 

Substantial Non-Compliance with the Provisions of the MOA between ECCD Council and 

Fund Recipient – LGUs 

 

3. The LGUs’ failure to adhere to the provisions of their MOAs with the ECCD 
Council and COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 was still noted 

which resulted in procedural lapses, as follows: a) non-compliance with the 

project timeline due to some operational delays, causing the deferment of benefits 

to the learners; b) delay/inadequate submission of supporting documents to the 

liquidation/fund utilization reports, affecting the timely evaluation of the 

propriety of the fund utilization and; c) delay in the submission of the prescribed 

documentary requirements for fund transfer by the LGUs resulting in unreleased 

checks at yearend to LGUs for NCDC construction and conversion to CDC  

projects totaling ₱15,200,000.00. 

 

3.1. Republic Act (RA) No. 10410, also known as the “Early Years Act”, is an Act 
which recognizes children from age zero to eight years as the first crucial stage 

of educational development, of which the age zero to four years shall be the 

responsibility of the ECCD Council. Section 2 of the same Act provides that 

the State shall institutionalize a National System for ECCD that is 

comprehensive, integrative, and sustainable that involves multi-sectoral and 

inter-agency collaboration at the national and local levels among government; 

among service providers, families, and communities; and among the public and 

private sectors, non-government organizations; professional associations and 

academic institutions. 

 

3.2. In pursuance of the above mandate, the Council aims to further enhance the 
provision of quality home-based and center-based ECCD programs by 

establishing NCDCs in partnership with LGUs. 

 

3.3. The LGUs that availed of the NCDC program entered into agreement with the 
Council through signing of a MOA. The program cost of ₱2,300,000.00, which 

is subject to liquidation, shall be utilized for the construction of the NCDC and 

will be released by the Council to the LGU upon perfection of the MOA and 

submission by the latter of the letter-request for the release of fund and 

information on the mode of construction. 

 

3.4. Aside from the establishment of the NCDC, the Council also manages the 
implementation of the conversion of existing DCCs to CDCs. Another MOA is 

entered into by the Council and the LGUs with established NCDCs to 

implement the said program. Under this, the Council will assist ten DCCs per 

LGU in the form of fund support amounting to ₱1,000,000.00 for the 

instructional materials renovation/repair/rehabilitation/completion of DCCs. 

 



49 

 

3.5. As per Agreement, the above programs are expected to be completed within 
210 calendar days from the receipt of the funds. The LGU shall refund to the 

Council the total fund release for these projects should it fail to complete the 

project’s implementation within the prescribed period. 

 

3.6. Section 7, Annex II of the MOA, entitled “Control, Accounting and Liquidation 
of Funds and Reportorial Requirements,” states that to liquidate the total 

amount released, the LGU shall submit within ten (10) days after the end of 

each month the following: a) letter of LGU submitting the liquidation with 

statement of percentage (%) of financial liquidation; and b) Statement of 

Releases and Disbursements (SORD), RCI and RD, duly verified by LGU 

Auditor. 

 

3.7. While Sections 4.6 and 4.9 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 
1994 provide that: 

 

“4.6 Within 10 days after the end of each month/end of the agreed 

period for the Project, the IA shall submit the RCI and the RD to 

report the utilization of the funds. Only actual project expenses 

shall be reported. The reports shall be approved by the Head of 

the IA. 

 

4.9 The IA shall return to the Source Agency (SA) any unused balance 

upon completion of the project.” 

 

3.8. Section 4.6 of PD No. 1445 and Section 5(f), Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, 
Volume I state that claims against government funds shall be supported with 

complete documentation. 

 

3.9. As at December 31, 2020, the ECCD Council had already provided total funds 
of ₱1,959,852,090.38 to 811 LGUs for the construction of NCDCs from CYs 

2011-2020, of which ₱1,447,673,194.53 or 73.87 percent was

3.17. The aforementioned delays in the completion of ECCD Council projects were 
due to some valid operational lapses such as the delayed/suspended 

procurement activities, delivery of construction materials and construction due 

to restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, change in 

administration and natural calamities such as typhoons and volcanic eruption.  

 

3.18. However, it was observed that LGUs of Alcoy, Tinglayan, San Remigio, 
Abuyog, Matag-ob, Bulan, Poro, Aparri, Salug, Hinundayan, Badiangan, Sta. 

Catalina and Basilisa with noted delays ranging from two months up to two 

years, had various project site issues such as the existence of buildings on the 

proposed site, which requires permission to be demolished and, in some cases, 

the need to change site. While LGUs of Candijay and Sagbayan did not provide 

valid reasons on the delayed procurement. This constitutes disregard and non-

compliance with the provisions of the MOA on the counterpart obligation of 

the LGUs to provide proof of ownership for the project site and the prescribed 

number of days to complete the project, thus adversely affects the timely and 

full attainment of the ECCD Council’s flagship program objective of ensuring 

that children aged zero to four reach their optimum growth and development. 

 

3.19. Moreover, it is also provided in the MOA, as duties and responsibilities of the 
ECCD Council, to monitor the implementation of the projects and to impose 

the refund of total fund release upon failure of the LGUs to complete the 

project’s implementation within the prescribed period, without valid 

justification. 

 

b) Delay and inadequate submission of liquidation/fund utilization reports by 
the LGUs with completed projects  

 

3.20. From the aforementioned review of the PMR, which revealed that 723 
constructions of NCDCs and 138 conversions were completed projects as of 

December 31, 2020, the aging schedule of Due from LGUs account still 



55 

 

reported an unliquidated balance of ₱313,094,257.59 for the construction of 

NCDCs and ₱58,092,059.89 for the conversion of existing DCCs to CDCs,

Subtotal - Rehabilitation of DCCs 4,099,508.57

3.22. This deficiency, as recurringly observed, is mainly attributed to the non-
submission of the project fund utilization and liquidation reports of the 

completed projects by the LGUs within the prescribed period as stipulated in 

the MOA and COA Circular No. 94-013 despite the series of follow-ups made 

by the Council. In fact, the Audit Team had also issued demand letters to 

defaulting 102 LGUs. The submission of liquidation/utilization report is 



56 

 

essential to ascertain the propriety of fund utilization and the implementation 

of the program. In addition, it also serves as the basis of the proper 

deduction/crediting of the Due from LGUs account together with the recording 

of the related expense account/s. 

 

3.23. Further, vouching of the recorded liquidations of 97 LGUs for the period from 
January to November 2020 disclosed that ECCD Council still records most of 

the liquidations without the sufficient documents. Summary of the documents 

submitted by LGUs for liquidation purposes are as follows: 

 
Documents Submitted No. of LGUs 

Statement of Percentage  

of Final Liquidation 

0 

SORD 66 

RCI 21 

RD 20 

 

3.24. As can be gleaned from the above summary, most of the LGUs submitted only 
the SORD and none had submitted the Statement of Percentage of Final 

Liquidation. The submission of other required documents to liquidate the funds, 

as stipulated in the MOA and COA Circular No. 94-013 RCI and RD, were not 

substantially adhered to by the LGUs, hence the propriety of fund utilizations 

could not be ascertained. 

 

3.25. The ECCD Council is reminded on the provisions of Section 4.6 of PD No. 
1445 and Section 5(f), Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I which state 

that claims against government funds shall be supported with complete 

documentation. The practice of recording the submitted liquidations by the 

LGUs despite the lack of supporting documents is a valid ground for the 

suspension of transactions which may lead to disallowance if not satisfactorily 

explained or validly justified by the parties concerned. 

 

c) delay in the submission of the prescribed documentary requirements for 
fund transfer resulting in unreleased checks at yearend to LGUs for their 

NCDC and CDC projects totaling ₱15,200,000.00 

 

3.26. Moreover, as of December 31, 2020, four checks with total amount of 
₱9,200,000.00 for the construction of NCDC and six checks with total amount 

of ₱6,000,000.00 for the conversion of DCC to CDC remained unreleased by 

ECCD Council to the recipient-LGUs. Details are as follows:

3.27. This is due to LGUs’ delay in submitting the documentary requirements, such 
as POW, ranging from 27 to 75 days reckoned from the date of preparation of 

checks by the ECCD Council. It has been the practice of the ECCD Council to 

prepare funding support check beforehand based on the MOA, the allocated 

amount of ₱2,300,000.00 each for the construction of NCDC, and 

₱1,000,000.00 each for the conversion to CDCs, upon submission of a letter-

request by the latter, without considering the POW as pre-requisite in 

determining the estimated cost of the project, thereby, resulting in unreleased 

checks at yearend and the need to release additional funding to LGUs whenever 

the amount in the POW exceeds the amount stipulated in the MOA. 

 

3.28. We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations that Management: 
 

a. undertake close monitoring of the project implementation timelines 
and strictly require the submission of the liquidation/utilization report 

so that demand to liquidate can be promptly made and the 

erring/defaulting recipient-LGUs can be made accountable; 

 

b. require the LGUs with slow progress or have not implemented the 
project and submitted liquidation/utilization reports within the 

prescribed period stated in the MOA to submit justification on the 

delayed implementation, otherwise, require the concerned LGUs to 

refund the unutilized fund equivalent to the unimplemented portion 

beyond the timeline; and 

 

c. strictly enforce the provisions of the MOA and COA Circular No. 94-
013 as to the required documentary requirements upon the 

preparation/issuance of checks along with the liquidation of funds, and 

or investigate the reasons for non-compliance by the LGUs. 

 

3.29. Management commented that they will continue to closely monitor the timely 
implementation of projects and require concerned LGUs to submit liquidation 

reports and return savings out of the amount granted to them. Based on the 

monitoring by NCDC Unit Staff, the LGUs that showed slow progress of 

implementation were advised to address the reasons of the delay/asked to 



58 

 

explain the reasons/especially those that incurred exceedingly long delay. There 

were already cases where LGUs were required, and complied, to refund to the 

Council the transferred funds that remained unutilized for a long period of time 

and as recommended, the provisions of the MOA and COA Circular No. 94-

013 as to the required documentary requirements will be followed upon the 

preparation/issuance of checks along with the liquidation of funds. 

 

Unliquidated fund transfers with PITC  

 

4. The balance of unliquidated fund transfers totaling ₱342,450,591.97 had 
remained outstanding by more than one to six years due to lapses on various 

procurement outsourcing agreement with PITC, thereby, depriving the 

intended recipient NCDCs and the child learners of the immediate use of the 

learning resources and other items. 

 

4.1. Prior to CY 2020, the ECCD Council had insufficient number of permanent 
plantilla positions to comply with the requirements in establishing its own BAC. 

To address the Agency’s procurement requirements, most importantly those 

that are needed in the implementation of its NCDC program such as, but not 

limited to, procurement of NCDC contents, the Agency signed and executed a 

MOA with the PITC on September 27, 2013, engaging the latter to act as the 

provider of Procurement Outsourcing Services and/or supplier of the former’s 

goods and services requirements.  

 

4.2. In consideration thereof, the Agency agreed to pay PITC a service fee plus VAT 
based on the Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC) of each procurement 

project to be deducted from the funds transferred by ECCD Council to PITC. 

Initial payment of 50 percent shall be due PITC, upon receipt by the winning 

bidder/supplier of the Notice of Award (NOA), which PITC shall prepare and 

sign on behalf of ECCD Council and the remaining balance of 50 percent shall 

be due PITC upon delivery and acceptance of the goods and/or services by 

ECCD Council. 

 

4.3. For each procurement project, the ECCD Council sends a Letter of Intent to 
PITC, together with the Agency Outsourcing Request (AOR), Terms of 

Reference (TOR), and Fund Transfer through check in the name of PITC. After 

receipt of the aforementioned documents and funding, PITC conducts 

procurement activities in coordination with the ECCD Council as to the 

product/service technical evaluation. 

 

4.4. Article III of the MOA provides, among others, the following policies on the 
manner of payment for goods and services procured by ECCD Council through 

or from PITC: 

 

1. “ECCD Council hereby authorizes PITC, upon the effectivity of 
this Agreement, to cause the opening of a Bank Account with an 



59 

 

authorized government depository bank under the account name 

“Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC-ECCDC 

MOA)” (hereafter referred to as the “MOA Account”), for the 

purpose of facilitating ECCD Council’s payments to PITC, by 

way of fund transfer, for all goods and services to be procured 

through or from PITC under this Agreement. 

 

2. Funds transferred to the MOA Account shall be the principal 
mode of ECCD Council’s payment for all goods and services to 

be procured through or from PITC under this Agreement, except 

as provided in No. 4 of this Article. 

 

3. Funds transferred to the MOA Account shall be considered as 
the source of funding for all goods and services to be procured 

through or from PITC, which funds shall be subject to a 

liquidation process based on the submission of the 

corresponding report of disbursement duly verified by the 

resident COA auditor of PITC.” 

 

4.5. The Due from GOCCs account of the ECCD Council in the Statement of 
Financial Position showed a balance of ₱342,450,591.97 as of December 31, 

2020. Audit of the account disclosed that the Agency transferred a total amount 

of ₱623,085,898.35 to the PITC in CYs 2013-2019 for the procurement of 

various NCDC contents such as IT equipment, signage, furniture and fixtures, 

manipulative learning materials, etc. and freight forwarding services. Out of the 

transferred balance, only ₱280,635,306.38 or 45.04 percent was liquidated. The

4.7. A setback in the procurement procedures undertaken by the PITC has been 
repeatedly observed as manifested by the delay in the deliveries of items 

procured and paid for in prior years. The delivery rate on fund transferred more 



61 

 

than four years up to six years ago (CYs 2014-2016) ranged from 60 to 96 

percent, while those transferred more than one year up to more than three years 

ago (CYs  2017-2019) showed zero to 26 percent only. Fund transferred in CYs 

2018 and 2019 have no corresponding delivery until CY 2020 and only the 

refunds of the unused fund transfers from completed projects totaling 

₱17,053,143.71 were recorded in the Agency’s books, as shown in the table

4.9. This observation has been noted in the previous year’s wherein the Management 
pointed out that the delay in the delivery occurred due to the lengthy period 

undertaken by PITC in reviewing and finalizing the specifications of the items 

to be procured before proceeding with the procurement activities. However, it 

was observed that over the years, PITC had contracted the services of the same 

suppliers for the supply and delivery of particular NCDC contents, in which the 

specifications remain the same or the changes are minimal, hence the reason is 

deemed unacceptable.  

 

4.10. Further, review of the MOA revealed that it did not provide for delivery 
timelines or target dates for completion of procurement procedures, thus 

delivery schedule is indefinite because the compliance rests solely with PITC’s 

terms and the availability of procurement schedule. Consequently, penalty in 

case of non-compliance or untimely compliance cannot be enforced.  

 

4.11. Due to the lapses in the ongoing procurement agreement with PITC, child 
learners of various NCDCs nationwide remained unequipped with the needed 



63 

 

NCDC contents which are necessary to their learning, development, and 

growth. Moreover, this may also subject the funds to risk of depreciation in 

terms of purchasing power considering the inflation or rise in prices of goods 

and services. Given the fact that these funds were transferred one to four years 

ago, the quantity of goods/services intended to be purchased by these fund 

transfers may no longer be obtained as originally planned given the changes in 

prices that took place in that given period. 

 

4.12. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations that Management: 
 

a. closely monitor the status of the procurement thru the PITC and 
require them to facilitate the delivery of the procured contents enabling 

the recipient NCDCs to receive the same for the immediate and 

maximum utilization by its intended beneficiaries; and 

 

b. require the return of the balance of transferred funds, in case of 
continuous failure of PITC to deliver. 

 

4.13 Management commented that their former Procurement Head and an ad-hoc 

member of PITC-BAC is doing continuous monitoring, coordination, and 

follow-up with concerned PITC officers to speed-up the delivery of contents to 

target beneficiaries. While there is delay in the procurement and delivery of 

goods for the ECCD Council’s AORs, the same are in various stages of 

procurement and delivery and hopefully may be delivered to the LGUs the 

soonest possible.  

 

Unliquidated fund transfers to DBM-PS   

 

5. The balance of unliquidated fund transfers to DBM-PS totaling ₱7,969.44 for 
the procurement of office supplies had remained outstanding by more than one 

to seven years, thus depriving the intended users of the immediate use thereof 

and the funds remain idle in the account of the DBM-PS. 

 

5.1. Item 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013 provides that it is the duty and 
responsibility of the IA to return to SA any unused balance and refund of 

disallowances upon the completion of the project. 

 

5.2. Specific guidelines in COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 
provides that the Accountant shall conduct regular and periodic verification, 

analysis, and validation of the existence of the unliquidated fund transfers and 

determine the source and implementing government entities and liquidation of 

the balances. 

 

5.3. The Due from NGAs account in the ECCD Council’s Statement of Financial 
Position as of December 31, 2020 showed a balance of ₱738,277.57, 

comprising of balance from advance payments for office supplies totaling 



64 

 

₱38,277.57 and initial deposit for airline ticket (PAL and Cebu Pacific) 

requirements for travel totaling ₱700,000.00 to DBM-PS. 

 

5.4. Aging of the account balance as of December 31, 2020 disclosed that out of 
₱38,277.57 unliquidated fund transfers for the procurement of common-use 

office supplies, ₱30,308.13 pertain to undelivered balance of two current year 

Agency Procurement Requests (APR), while the remaining ₱7,969.44 pertain 

to offsetting over/under deliveries of 14 APRs in prior years which remained 

outstanding for over one year to more than seven years from the date of issuance 

of checks. Details are shown in the following table:

5.5. The undelivered balance was also reported and duly reconciled with the DBM-
PS books, but the ECCD failed to apply its current office supplies requirements 

to the said balance or enforce the refund thereof, contrary to Item 6.7 of COA 

Circular No. 94-013 and specific guidelines in COA Circular No. 2016-005 

dated December 19, 2016, thus depriving the intended users of the immediate 

use thereof and the funds idle in the account of the DBM-PS. 

 

5.6. We recommended and Management agreed to apply its current office 
supplies requirements from the transferred funds outstanding with the 

DBM-PS amounting to ₱7,969.44 and/or demand the refund of the 

unutilized/dormant funds and remit the same to the Bureau of the 

Treasury (BTr).

Inadequate Inventory Accounting System 

 

6. The accuracy and existence of the recorded Property and Equipment for 
Distribution Inventory account of ₱61,954,499.82 at yearend could not be fully 

validated due to deficient control in the inventory accounting system, such as: 

a) absence of Supplies Ledger Card (SLC), Stock Card (SC), and other sources 

of information for making entries therein, contrary to Chapter 8, GAM for 

NGAs Volume I; b) non-conformance of the report on the physical count of 

inventories with the prescribed format in Appendix 66, GAM for NGAs, Volume 

II; and c) non-reconciliation of the Accounting and Property/Supply Unit 

records. Further, the incompatible duties of procurement, accounting, and 

access to assets were being performed by one Agency personnel. 

 

6.1. The heads of the government agencies are responsible for ensuring that all 
resources entrusted to them are managed, expended, or lawfully utilized and 

safeguarded against loss or wastage to ensure efficiency, economy, and 

effectiveness in operations of government, as provided under PD No. 1445, s. 

1978, as amended. Internal Control, including internal audit, provides the 

foundation for stronger accountability and good governance in public service 

organizations. 

 

6.2. Chapter 8, GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides the pertinent provisions related 
to Inventory Accounting System. These are as follows: 

 

Section 9 - Perpetual Inventory System requires accounting records 

to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the 

maintenance of the SLC by the Accounting Division/Unit and SC by 

the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock.     

 

Section 13 - The Inventory Accounting System consists of the 

system of monitoring, controlling, and recording of acquisition and 

disposal of inventory. It also requires that the Accounting and 

Property Offices shall conduct periodic reconciliation of their 

records to identify and adjust any discrepancy. 

 

Section 14 - The Sub-Systems for inventory accounting are as 

follows: a) Receipt, Inspection, Acceptance and Recording 

Deliveries of Inventory Items; b) Requisition and Issue of Inventory 

Items; and c) Transfer and/or Disposal of Inventory Items. 

 

Section 17 – Provided list and explanation of the records, forms, and 

reports prescribed for use and/or to be maintained by the NGAs for 

the effective implementation of Inventory Accounting System.  

 

6.3. Currently, the ECCD Council does not have written specific guidelines and 
procedures on delivery, acceptance, and recording of internally and outsourced 



66 

 

procured assets. Evaluation of the existing procedures of the ECCD Council 

was conducted to determine the causes of perennial deficiencies in the ECCD 

Council’s Property and Equipment for Distribution account and to determine 

compliance with the Inventory Accounting System prescribed under the GAM 

for NGAs, and noted the following: 

 

a) Absence of SLC, SC and other original sources of original sources of 
information for making entries therein  

 

6.4. Section 17 (c) of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that the Accounting 
Unit should maintain SLC (Appendix 57) to record materials received, issued 

and the balance both in quantity and amount at any time. The IAR (Appendix 

62), Requisition Issue Slip (RIS) (Appendix 63), Report of Supplies and 

Materials Issued (RSMI) (Appendix 64), Purchase Order (PO) (Appendix 61), 

and DR serve as the original sources of information for making entries on the 

card.  

 

6.5. The audit disclosed lapses in the existing procedure of the Accounting Unit in 
recording the total cost of funds liquidated by the PITC upon receipt of PCR as 

a debit to Inventory account and not based on the IAR and DR upon actual 

receipt of items. The corresponding quantity and unit cost of each item received, 

and subsequent issuances/transfers were not also accounted for in the SLC due 

to the absence of IAR, DR, RIS, RSMI, PO, DR, and PTR from the 

Property/Supply Unit. 

 

6.6. Further, for check and balance, the same Manual prescribes the maintenance of 
SC (Appendix 58) by the Property/Supply Unit for inventories in their custody 

to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. Periodically, the balance 

per SC shall be reconciled with SLC maintained by the Accounting 

Division/Unit. However, SC was not also maintained by the Property/Supply 

Unit. 

 

b) non-conformance of the report on the physical count of inventories with the 
prescribed format in Appendix 66, GAM for NGAs, Volume II 

 

6.7. Section 17 (i) of the GAM for NGAs also prescribes the use of Report on the 
Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) (Appendix 66) to report the physical 

count of supplies by type of inventory as at a given date. It shows the balance 

of inventory items per card and per count and shortage/overage, if any.  

 

6.8. The Management submitted the report on the physical count of inventories for 
the semester ending December 31, 2020, on February 5, 2021. However, instead 

of the prescribed format in Appendix 66, GAM for NGAs, Volume II, a 

Monitoring Report of Other Contents delivered to ECCD Council stored at 

Taguig warehouse was submitted. The said report does not include the details 

of contents directly delivered to the centers by the PITC-contracted suppliers. 



67 

 

The result of the evaluation of the adequacy and completeness of the said report 

are as follows:

6.9. As can be gleaned from the table above, majority of the required information in 
the RPCI template prescribed under the GAM for NGAs, Volume II were not 

provided in the monitoring report submitted by the Management.  

 

c) non-reconciliation of the Accounting and Property records 
 

6.10. Appendix 57 and 58, GAM for NGAs, Volume II instruct that transactions shall 
be posted promptly in SLC and SC based on the sources of information, and the 

semestral physical inventory of supplies shall be reconciled with the SLCs and 

SCs and controlling accounts and Supply and/or Property records. The 

absence/inadequacy of such forms/reports prohibits the timely recording of 

transactions and reconciliation between records, thus discrepancies were not 

immediately verified and adjusted. 

 

6.11. Moreover, it was noted that the former Procurement Head and a designated 
provisional member of the PITC BAC is also responsible for the receipts, 

issuances, preparation, and reconciliation of monitoring report on the Property 

and Equipment for Distribution Inventory account of the agency. This is 

contrary to one of the preventive measures of internal control on proper 

segregation of duties among different people to reduce the risk of error or 

inappropriate action. 

 

6.12. The unreconciled variances and discrepancies in both the Accounting and 
Property/Supply Units’ records were primarily due to the failure of both Offices 

to maintain the required reports, conduct reconciliation of their respective 

records during the year, failure of the Accounting Units to update its records 

caused by the non-preparation and non-submission of the source documents 

such as the IAR, RIS, RSMI, PO, and DR by the Property/Supply Unit and the 

performance of incompatible duties of procurement, accounting, and access to 

assets by one person, signifies the lack of sound Inventory Accounting System 

as prescribed in Chapter 8, GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

6.13. Likewise, the non-submission of complete, accurate, and reliable inventory 
records by the Accounting and/or Property/Supply Units of the Agency to the 

Audit Team rendered it difficult to ascertain the accuracy and existence of the 

reported Property and Equipment for Distribution Inventory account at yearend. 

 

6.14. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. strengthen internal controls through the provision of specific guidelines 
and procedures, including responsible offices, officials, and 

appropriate documentation for the inventory accounting sub-systems 

such as: a) receipt, inspection, acceptance and recording deliveries; b) 

requisition and issue; c) transfer and/or disposal; and d) monitoring 

and inventory-taking of inventory items; 

 



69 

 

b. strictly require the Accounting and Property/Supply Units to 
use/maintain the prescribed inventory reports/forms in Chapter 8, 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I and adhere to other relevant instructions in 

preparing these reports in accordance with GAM for NGAs, Volume 

II; 

 

c. effect the timely reconciliation with the Accounting and 
Property/Supply records against the related forms/reports to facilitate 

timely verification and adjustments of any discrepancies noted; and 

 

d. consider creating an Internal Audit Service to strengthen the internal 
control system of the Agency. 

 

6.15. Management commented that they will consolidate their guidelines and 
procedures to include the responsible offices and officials as well as the systems 

from receipt, monitoring, inventory-taking, issuance and disposal of inventory 

items. They will also require the Accounting and Property/Supply Units to 

use/maintain the prescribed inventory report/forms in accordance with GAM 

for NGAs, Volumes I and II and the conduct of timely reconciliation of records. 

The creation of Internal Audit Service/creation of an Internal Auditor position 

will be considered in the next request to DBM for additional plantilla positions. 

 

Irregular and Unnecessary Consultancy Services 

 

7. Audit of Consultancy Services expenses incurred by the ECCD Council in CY 
2020 totaling ₱2,110,000.00 showed some gaps, such as: a) two retired key 

employees were hired as highly-technical consultants but carried out the 

functions of their previous designations; and b) non-submission of a copy of 

perfected Consultancy Contracts including each of all the documents forming 

part thereof to determine adherence to competitiveness and transparency, 

which are contrary to Section 129, Rule XII of Civil Service Commission (CSC) 

Resolution No. 1800692 promulgated on July 3, 2018,  Revised Implementing 

Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 9184, and COA Circular No. 2009-001 

dated February 12, 2009 on the timely submission of contracts; hence, may 

render the transactions irregular and unnecessary. 

 

7.1. Section 5.i of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 defines consulting services as 
“services for infrastructure projects and other types of projects or activities of 

the government requiring adequate external technical and professional expertise 

that are beyond the capability and/or capacity of the Government to undertake 

such as, but not limited to: (i) advisory and review services; (ii) pre-investment 

or feasibility studies; (iii) design; (iv) construction supervision; (v) 

management and related services; and (vi) other technical services or special 

studies”. 

 



70 

 

7.2. Section 2 of the same Revised IRR states that government procurement of 
infrastructure projects, goods and consulting services shall be competitive and 

transparent, and therefore shall go through public bidding. However, the law 

allows the use of alternative methods of procurement in some exceptional 

instances, provided, there is prior approval of the Head of the Procuring Entity, 

as recommended by the BAC and the conditions required by law for the use of 

alternative methods are present. 

 

7.3. For the procurement of consulting services, negotiated procurement (NP) and 
limited source bidding are the only alternative methods that may be used. NP 

may be resorted in any of the following cases: a) Two Failed Biddings; b) 

Emergency Cases; c) Take-over of Contracts; d) Adjacent or Contiguous 

Projects; e) Agency to Agency; f) Scientific, Scholarly or Artistic Work, 

Exclusive Technology and Media Services; g) Highly Technical Consultants 

(HTC); and h) Small Value Procurement (SVP). 

 

7.4. Likewise, Section 54.6 of the Revised RIRR mandated the Consultants to 
register with the Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System 

(PhilGEPS) and provide a PhilGEPS registration in the following alternative 

methods of procurement as a condition for award of the contract: direct 

contracting, shopping for ordinary office supplies and equipment; take-over of 

contracts; scientific, scholarly, or artistic work; highly technical consultants; 

small value procurement; lease of real property and venue; and non-

governmental organization (NGO) participation. 

 

7.5. Section 129, Rule XII of CSC Resolution No. 1800692 promulgated on July 3, 
2018, provides that “No person who has reached the compulsory retirement 

age of 65 years can be appointed to any position in the government, except 

to a primarily confidential position.” 

 

7.6. COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 requires that within five 
(5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of 

its subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities, a copy of said contract and each 

of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be 

furnished to the Auditor of the Agency concerned. 

 

7.7. For the CY 2020, the ECCD Council incurred a total amount of ₱2,110,000.00 
for the technical services support of five consultants in the different 

Offices/Units of the Agency. Their individual monthly Honorarium ranged 

from ₱50,000.00 to ₱80,000.00 and the total expenses incurred in CY 2020 are 

summarized in the table below:

7.8. Analysis of the postings in the GL, the supporting documents on payments 
made to Consultants and the reports submitted by the Human Resource 

Management Unit of ECCD Council as of December 31, 2020 revealed the 

following observations/deficiencies: 

 

a) Two retired key employees were hired as highly technical consultants but 
carried out the functions of their previous designations  

 

7.9. In CY 2020, Mr. Felixberto C. Sanchez and Ms. Leticia B. Pichay, both 
plantilla-contractual employees, carrying out key roles in the operations of the 

ECCD Council as Chief Administrative Officer/Chief Accountant and Planning 

Officer V, respectively, had their compulsory retirement effective March 18, 

2020 and May 10, 2020, respectively.  

 

7.10. Executive Director Teresita G. Inciong, in a letter dated April 6, 2020, received 
by the CSC through electronic mail on May 8, 2020, requested the extension of 

service of Ms. Pichay after the latter’s 65th birthday on May 10, 2020 premised 

on exigency of the service. The CSC, in a Resolution No. 2000848 promulgated 

on September 25, 2020 and issued on September 28, 2020, granted the 

extension of service of Ms. Pichayfor a period of six (6) months from May 11, 

2020 to November 10, 2020.  

 



72 

 

7.11. It was noted that in this resolution, the CSC reminded ECCD Council to prepare 
a contingency plan and scout for qualified personnel for the said position to 

replace Ms. Pichay upon her exit. However, the ECCD Council opted to hire 

Ms. Pichay as highly technical consultant effective November 16, 2020 to 

December 31, 2020. 

 

7.12. Further, Mr. Sanchez officially retired and was replaced by Ms. Necitas D. 
Largo, former Procurement Head of ECCD Council on March 13, 2020 through 

an Office Order No. 22 s. 2020 signed by Director Inciong, until her plantilla-

contractual appointment was approved by the CSC effective July 1, 2020 until 

December 31, 2020. 

 

7.13. Ms. Pichay was not able to submit the supporting documents on her claims for 
payment of actual services rendered as a Consultant for the period from 

November 16, 2020 to December 31, 2020. However, the Terms of Reference 

(TOR) attached to the request for quotation/proposal on the hiring of ECCD 

Council Individual Program Consultant for NCDC Project Management and 

Special Concerns, which was posted on PhilGEPs on November 6, 2020, 

provided the list of tasks/responsibilities as follows: 

 
TERMS OF REFERENCE 

Tasks/Responsibilities 

1. Provide assistance to the ECCD Council Management in the conduct of NCDC project 
management and other special concerns to ensure compliance with government 

regulations; 

2. Render advice on the strategies and approaches for the prompt submission by the local 
government units of financial documentary requirements specifically on Fund 

Utilization Reports and take the lead in monitoring compliance thereof; 

3. Provide support and assistance in addressing timely and emerging ECCD concerns and 
coordinate in the implementation of special programs and projects as may be assigned 

by the Management; 

4. Coordinate in the gathering and maintenance of ECCD database such as establishment 
of roster of private learning centers; 

5. Recommend actions and responses to be taken on matters referred by ECCD Council 
Management related to financial management and administration;

submitted by the LGUs as basis to update the Council's financial records; 

7. Attend and participate in the Council's planning, conferences, workshops and other 
periodic and special meetings as required by ECCD Council Management; 

8. Pursue networking and partnering efforts at the local level for efficient and responsive 
program implementation and participate in official trips when needed; 

9. Coordinate with various ECCD Council Units and other partner-agencies units for 
collaboration and pertinent concerns including the Council's legislative agenda; 

10. Prepare communications and documentation proceedings of ECCD Council's meetings 
and other activities as may be required by Management; 

11. Submit a monthly report of accomplishment to the Council. 

 

7.14. It was observed that these tasks/responsibilities listed in TOR pertain to part of 
Ms. Pichay’s responsibility as former Planning Officer V of ECCD Council, 



73 

 

and some other tasks were not highly technical in nature and could be performed 

or were already part of functions of the existing regular and contract of service 

employees of the Agency.  

 

7.15. Likewise, post-audit of disbursement vouchers on the payment of Consultancy 
Services of Mr. Sanchez for the period from July 16, 2020 to December 31, 

2020 amounting to ₱330,000.00 showed that the services he rendered refer to 

functions of the regular employees, specifically his previous designation as 

Chief Administrative Officer. This was affirmed in the Accomplishment 

Reports submitted as summarized below:

74 

 

7.16. On these premises, it can be construed that the Agency contracted the services 
of these two former regular employees not in the necessity of external highly 

technical and professional expertise that are beyond the in-house capability 

and/or capacity of the Agency to undertake, as required under  Section 5.i of 

the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184, nor the exception in the general rule that the 

appointment of a person over sixty-five years old is not allowed, for positions 

that are primarily confidential, under Section 129, Rule XII of CSC Resolution 

No. 1800692 promulgated on July 3, 2018, but to address the absence of key 

agency personnel.  

 

7.17. This may be attributed to the lack of succession and contingency plans of the 
ECCD Council in cases of pre-determined personnel changes like retirements, 

wherein the task and responsibilities of the retired employees must be properly 

turned over, the incumbent personnel must be trained, or there is an urgent need 

to hire qualified applicants for the long-term replacement of critical positions 

in the Agency, so it can continue to achieve its objectives despite their absence. 

 

b) Non-submission of a copy of perfected Consultancy Contracts and each of 
all the documents forming part thereof to determine adherence to 

competitiveness and transparency 

 

7.18. The Personnel Complement Report submitted by the Human Resource 
Management Unit of ECCD Council showed that there are five Consultants 

hired in CY 2020. Their contract periods ranged from one and half to six months 

and the modes of procurement are as follows:

5 Leticia B. Pichay November 16 to December

NP– HTC/SVP 

 

7.19. It was noted that Ms. Domingo and Mr. Tantuan were hired as Consultants since 
CY 2013 and their consultancy contracts were renewed semi-annually since 

then. The Management was not able to provide the details of the original mode 

of procurement of their consultancy services and the reason for their continued 

hiring, considering the time elapsed since they were originally hired.  

 

7.20. Meanwhile, Ms, De Mesa, Mr. Sanchez, and Ms, Pichay were hired on February 
1, 2020, July 16, 2020, and November 16, 2020, respectively, through an NP-

HTC/SVP mode of procurement. The evaluation of the submitted consultancy 



75 

 

contracts with Ms. De Mesa and Mr. Sanchez revealed that all the documents 

forming part thereof and all other required information and supporting papers 

to justify the hiring of Consultants, as set forth in the Annex D of COA Circular 

No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, and the result of validation of BAC as 

to legal, technical, and financial capability of the individual consultant required 

under Annex H of RA No. 9184 were not forwarded to the Audit Team for 

technical evaluation. Further, the consultancy contract and other supporting 

documents/attachments of Ms. Pichay remain unsubmitted to date. 

 

7.21. The absence of the aforementioned contract and documents hindered the 
assessment on whether the services rendered by these Consultants were beyond 

the in-house capability of the ECCD Council and precluded the Audit Team 

from proper evaluation of the reasonableness of the consulting fees incurred by 

the Agency, and the adherence to competitiveness and transparency. 

 

7.22. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. evaluate the organizational structure, staffing pattern and manpower 
requirements of each Offices/Unit of the Agency to determine if the 

consultancy services needed are beyond the optimum in-house 

capability of the Agency to undertake, and to ensure that the need for 

the procurement of consulting services is thoroughly reviewed to 

minimize procurement of consultancy services that can be performed 

by the incumbent personnel or staff;  

 

b. devise succession and contingency plans in cases of personnel changes 
due to retirements and resignations, which includes proper turn-over, 

adequate training on the incumbents and hiring of a qualified applicant 

for the long-term replacement of critical positions in the Agency; and 

 

c. provide the necessary supporting documents of the consultancy 
contracts of five ECCD Council Consultants such as the TOR and all 

other required information and supporting papers to justify their 

hiring to avoid suspension or disallowance on related disbursements. 

 

7.23. Management commented that they always based their decision to hire the 
services of individual Consultants, even those hired under contractual and COS 

basis, on the need to enhance the capability of the existing staff to facilitate the 

achievement of the Agency’s mandate. The Council agreed to devise a 

succession plan in cases of retirements and resignations including proper turn-

over and training of qualified incumbents and new personnel especially for 

critical positions. Relative to this, the Council has been actively pursuing to fill-

up the vacant Accountant position but regrettably failed to employ one despite 

at least two ad placements and screening of applicants. The Agency submitted 

the information/papers related to the hiring of Consultants. 



76 

 

7.24. The Audit Team acknowledges the justification and efforts exerted by the 
Management. However, it has to be emphasized that compliance with the CSC 

on the preparation of a contingency plan and scouting for qualified personnel 

must be prioritized and the Council must set specific timeline for this endeavor.  

 

Non-submission of Perfected Contracts/Purchase Orders (POs) 

 

8. Copies of the 22 perfected contracts/POs and their supporting documents 
relative to the procurement of goods and services totaling ₱29,068,704.56 in CY 

2020 were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor for review and evaluation 

within five working days from the execution, contrary to the requirements of 

Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009. 

 

8.1. Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 
2009 relative to the submission of contracts/POs to the Commission require 

that: 

 

“Section 3.1.1 - Within five (5) working days from the execution of a 

contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies, or 

instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled 

corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each 

of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or 

incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency 

concerned. In case of agencies audited on an engagement basis, 

submission of a copy of the contract and its supporting documents 

shall be to the Auditor of the mother agency or parent company. 

 

Section 3.2.1 - A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, 

and each supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days 

from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned. Within 

the same period, the Auditor shall review and point out to 

management defects and/or deficiencies, if any, in the same manner 

provided in the second and third sentences of item 3.1.4 hereof.” 

 

8.2. The purpose of furnishing the advance copy of contracts is for the Auditor to 
review and evaluate its compliance with requirements of applicable laws, rules, 

and regulations, completeness of documentary requirements, that the 

contractual covenants are not disadvantageous to the government and if there 

be deficiencies, to suggest such corrective measures as are appropriate and 

warranted. 

 

8.3. Section 2(j), Chapter 3 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I defines obligation as an 
act of a duly authorized official which binds the government to the immediate 

or eventual payment of a sum of money. Obligation may be referred to as a 

commitment that encompasses possible future liabilities based on current 

contractual agreement.

8.4. The ECCD Council’s Financial Accountability Report (FAR) No. 3 – Aging of 
Due and Demandable Obligations (ADDO) as of December 31, 2020 for Fund 

Cluster 01 – Regular Agency Fund and Fund Cluster 03 – Special Accounts-

Locally Funded, reported various unpaid obligations by the Agency in CY 

2020, for the procurement of goods and services in which the contract/PO and

8.5. The Management was reminded thru email on January 18, 2021, to comply with 
the provision of COA Circular No. 2009-001 on the timely submission of 

contracts/POs. However, it remained as the Agency’s practice to submit the 

copies of contracts/POs and supporting documents as attachment to 

Disbursement Vouchers upon payment to suppliers. As a result, the Audit Team 

was precluded from performing auditorial review of the procurement 



78 

 

transactions and the prompt detection/correction of possible deficiencies as well 

as the timely reporting of the audit results to the Management. 

 

8.6. In view of the deficiencies noted, the Agency is reminded of sanctions provided 
under Section 4 of COA Circular No. 2009-001, to wit: 

 

“Any unjustified failure of the officials and employees concerned to 

comply with the requirements herein imposed shall be subject to the 

administrative disciplinary action provided in (a) Section 127 of PD 

No. 1445; (b) Section 55, Title I-B, Book V of the Revised 

Administrative Code of 1987; and (c) Section 11 of RA No. 6713.” 

 

8.7. We recommended, and Management agreed, to require the BAC to submit 
the Contracts/POs and their supporting documents and observe the five-

day reglementary period in submitting the same to facilitate timely review 

and appropriate action thereon. 

 

Transparency and Accountability in Government Operations 

 

9. Transparency in governance was not fully assured by the  ECCDC when the 
posting and updating of the information on donations, trust receipts, public funds, 

audit, financial  and physical reports, as well as the required ‘Transparency Seal’ 

in its official website have not been completely undertaken as mandated under 

Sections  89, 90, 91 and 94 of the GP, GAA for FY 2020 or RA No. 11465; thus, 

depriving the public of inclusiveness to the pertinent information necessary to 

enforce accountability among its officials.   

 

Moreover, this also affected the Agency’s eligibility for Performance-Based Bonus 

(PBB) in CY 2020 due to non-compliance with the good governance conditions 

required under Memorandum Circular No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 2020.  

 

9.1. Applicable provisions in the GAA of FY 2020 or RA No. 11465 to enhance 
transparency and accountability in the government are the following: 

 

• Section 89. Report on Commission on Audit Findings and 
Recommendations  

 

“Within sixty (60) days from receipt of the COA Annual Audit Report, 

agencies concerned shall submit to the COA, either in printed form or by 

way of electronic document, a status report on the actions taken on said 

audit findings and recommendations using the prescribed form under COA 

Memorandum No. 2014-002 dated March 18, 2014. They shall likewise 

furnish the DBM, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President 

of the Senate of the Philippines, the House Committee on Appropriations, 

and the Senate Committee on Finance, either in printed form or by way of 

electronic document, a copy of said reports. 



79 

 

The heads of agencies and the agencies’ web administrator or their 

equivalent shall be responsible for ensuring that said status reports are 

likewise posted in their respective websites.” 

 

• Section 90. Financial Reports  
 

 “On or before the tenth (10th) day of the month immediately following the 

covered period, departments, bureaus, offices and instrumentalities of the 

National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal 

autonomy and SUCs, shall submit the monthly report on appropriations, 

allotments, obligations and disbursements of current appropriations, as 

well as the monthly report of disbursement, through the following: a) URS 

or other electronic means for reports not covered by the URS; and b) 

Agency’s website. 

 

 The agency shall send written notice when said reports have been submitted 

or posted on its website to the DBM, House of Representatives, Senate of 

the Philippines, House Committee on Appropriations, and the Senate 

Committee on Finance, and other offices where the submission of reports is 

required under existing laws, rules, and regulations. The date of notice to 

said agencies shall be considered the date of compliance with this 

requirement.” 

 

• Section 91.  Financial and Physical Reports 
 

 “Within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter, departments, 

bureaus, offices and instrumentalities of the National Government, 

including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs, shall 

submit the quarterly reports on its financial and physical accomplishments 

as well as reports and other information mandated in the special and 

general provisions of this Act, through the following: a) URS or other 

electronic means for reports not covered by the URS; and b) Agency’s 

website. 

 

 The agency shall send written notice when said reports have been submitted 

or posted on its website to the DBM, House of Representatives, Senate of 

the Philippines, House Committee on Appropriations, and the Senate 

Committee on Finance, and other offices where the submission of reports is 

required under existing laws, rules, and regulations. The date of notice to 

said agencies shall be considered the date of compliance with this 

requirement. 

 

 Failure to comply with any of the foregoing shall result in the automatic 

suspension of the salaries of the responsible official or employee until they 

have complied with the above requirements pursuant to Section 57, Chapter 

6, Book VI of E.O. No. 292. 



80 

 

 Repeated failure or refusal of said official and employee to submit the above 

reports or to post the reports on the Agency’s official website without any 

justifiable cause may be a ground for administrative disciplinary action, 

subject to pertinent civil service rules and regulations. The head of agency 

shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with this penalty provision.” 

 

• Section 94. Transparency Seal  
 

“To enhance transparency and enforce accountability, all agencies of the 

government shall maintain a Transparency Seal to be posted on their 

websites. The Transparency Seal shall contain the following information: 

(i) the agency’s mandates and functions, names of its officials with their 

position and designation, and contact information; (ii) approved budgets 

and corresponding targets, immediately upon approval of this Act; (iii) 

modifications made pursuant to the general and special provisions in this 

Act; (iv) annual procurement plan/s and contracts awarded with the 

winning supplier, contractor or consultant; (v) major activities or projects 

categorized in accordance with the 0+10 point socio economic agenda and 

their target beneficiaries;   (vi) status of implementation, evaluation or 

assessment reports of said programs or projects; (vii) Budget and Financial 

Accountability Reports; (viii) People’s Freedom of Information (FOI) 

Manual signed  by head of agency, Agency Information Inventory, 2018 and 

2019 FOI Summary Report, and 2018 and 2019 FOI Registry; and (ix) 

annual reports on the status of income authorized by law to be retained 

and/or used and be deposited outside of the National Treasury, which shall 

include the legal basis for its retention and/or use, the beginning balance, 

income collected and its sources, expenditures, and ending balance for the 

preceding fiscal year. 

 

The heads of the agencies and their web administrators or their equivalent 

shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with this section.” 

  

9.2. Further, Section 4 of Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 
2020 issued by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on the Harmonization of 

National Government Performance Monitoring, Information and Reporting 

Systems on Guidelines on the Grant of the PBB for Fiscal Year 2020 under 

Executive Order No. 80 s. 2012 and Executive Order No. 201 s. 2016, likewise 

provides the Good Governance Conditions (GGCs) based on performance 

drivers of the Results-Based Performance Management System (RBPMS) and 

the priorities of the Duterte Administration for 1) heightened transparency; 2) 

stronger public accountability; and 3) more inclusive and people-centered 

public service, as one of the conditions to be eligible for the grant of PBB. 

Among these is the maintenance/update of the agency Transparency Seal under 

Section 94 of the GP of the FY 2020 GAA.   

 



81 

 

9.3. Ideally, the Transparency Seal summarizes all the needed data in the nine 
identified components as prescribed in the current budget act. It is depicted by 

a pearl shining out of an open shell, which is a symbol of a policy shift towards 

openness in access to government information. It hopes to inspire Filipinos in 

the civil service to be more open to citizen engagement; on the other hand, it 

invites the citizenry to exercise their right to participate in governance. This 

initiative is envisioned as a step in the right direction towards solidifying the 

position of the country as a shining example for democratic virtue in the region. 

 

9.4. Validation of the Agency’s official website at https://eccdcouncil.gov.ph/ 
showed that the following requirements mandated under Sections 89, 90, 91 

and 94 of the GP, GAA for FY 2020 or RA No. 11465 are not/partially complied 

with by the ECCD Council:

Not applicable to ECCD 

Council 

n/a 

 

9.5. The Management’s failure to fully utilize its official website to disclose to the 
public all the vital information enumerated above is a glaring setback in 

adopting measures to ensure transparency and accountability which is required 

from the Agency, as one of the budgetary reforms being undertaken to 

encourage good governance among the different branches of government.   

 

9.6. Similarly, the need to employ these available digital platforms is more fitting 
nowadays due to the challenges brought in by the pandemic, where restriction 

on movement is imposed across the country.   Making use of the advances 

provided by this website to communicate the important information is now the 

new norm that is unparalleled and paramount under these circumstances. 



83 

 

9.7. Furthermore, like what happened in previous years, these deficiencies also 
affected the Agency’s eligibility for PBB in CY 2020 due to non-compliance 

with good governance conditions required under Memorandum Circular No. 

2020-1 dated June 2, 2020 issued by IATF on the Harmonization of National 

Government Performance Monitoring, Information, and Reporting Systems.  

 

9.8. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. comply strictly with Sections 89, 90, 91, and 94 of the GP of the GAA 
of 2020 or RA No. 11465 and Section 4 of Memorandum Circular 2020-

1 dated June 2, 2020 issued by IATF on the Harmonization of National 

Government Performance Monitoring, Information and Reporting 

Systems; and 

 

b. ensure that the Agency’s available information technology resources 
are utilized to make certain that the transparency and accountability 

of its operational and financial affairs are strictly implemented.  

 

9.9. Management acknowledged the observation in their website and explained that 
they introduced a new layout and design of the website’s interface which is 

more user-friendly and responsive to the viewers. Since its updating, together 

with the program and other contents of the site, the Council also began to upload 

the documents required in the Transparency Seal section. However, the 

uploading of the documents was not completed due to the unpredictable work 

schedule last year. They informed the Audit Team that the ECCD Council has 

been issued a Certificate of Compliance by the IATF on the Harmonization of 

National Government Performance Monitoring, Information, and Reporting 

Systems for the FOI Manual that was uploaded in their Transparency Seal 

Section. However, this was removed temporarily, while redesigning the site. 

Lastly, as recommended, the ECCD Council will utilize its available technology 

resources to ensure transparency and accountability of its operational and 

financial affairs by strictly complying with the applicable provisions of the 

GAA and Memorandum Circular issued by the IATF. 

 

Budget Utilization 

 

10. The budget and cash requirements during the year were not effectively and 
efficiently utilized, since out of the ₱197,383,616.90 adjusted allotments received 

by the Agency in CY 2020, ₱161,997,551.58 or 82.07 percent was obligated, 

leaving an unobligated balance of ₱35,386,065.32. Moreover ₱72,701,312.78 or 

32.14 percent of the total ₱226,230,000.00 Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) had 

lapsed and reverted to the BTr depriving all of its stakeholders of the fullest 

possible use that can be derived from the allocated funds to finance its approved 

programs. 

 



84 

 

10.1. The government budget is the financial plan of the government for a given 
period, usually for a fiscal year, which shows what its resources are, and how 

they will be generated and used over the fiscal period. The budget is the 

government’s key instrument for promoting its socio-economic objectives. The 

government budget also refers to the income, expenditures, and sources of 

borrowings of the National Government (NG) that are used to achieve national 

objectives, strategies, and programs. 

 

10.2. Section 60 of the RA No. 11465, or the GAA of FY 2020, and Section 3.4 of 
the National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated January 6, 2020 state that 

all appropriations authorized under the FY 2020 GAA, shall be available for 

release and disbursement for the purpose specified until December 31, 2020.  

 

10.3. However, RA No. 11520, as approved by the President on December 29, 2020 
extended the availability of the 2020 appropriations for Maintenance and Other 

Operating Expenses (MOOE) and Capital Outlay (CO) up to December 31, 

2021. 

 

10.4. Section 4(v) of R.A. No. 11469 dated April 1, 2020 or The Bayanihan to Heal 
as One Act directed the discontinuance of appropriated program/activities/ 

projects (P/A/Ps) of any agency of the Executive Department, in FYs 2019 and 

2020 General GAAs, including unreleased appropriations and unobligated 

released allotments.  

 

10.5. NBC No. 580 dated April 22, 2020 provides possible measures for the 
discontinuance of appropriated P/A/Ps, whether released or unreleased as well 

as unobligated allotments of covered entities as of March 31, 2020 to fund the 

operations and response measures related to the Coronavirus disease (COVID-

19) emergency situation. 

 

10.6. A three-year analysis of ECCD Council’s budget utilization showed a steady 
increase in the unutilized amount despite significant decrease of allotment in 

CY 2020 due to discontinued Programs, Activities and Projects (PAPs) totaling 

₱6,516,062.00, in compliance with NBC No. 580 dated April 22, 2020 and the 

unreleased appropriation of ₱294,623,000.00 for the establishment of NCDCs. 

The percentage of unutilized budget in CY 2020 had further increased by 4.88 

percent from 13.05 percent in CY 2019 to 17.93 percent in CY 2020, to wit:

10.7. Review of ECCD Council’s BFARs showed that of the total appropriations of 
P498,590,678.90 for CY 2020, the amount of ₱197,383,616.90 was received as 



85 

 

allotments including funds from Continuing Appropriations.  Of the total 

allotments received, ₱161,997,551.58 or 82.07 percent was obligated, leaving

10.8. Significant unobligated balances were noted in the allotments for MOOE in the 
Agency’s regular and special funds amounting to ₱21,521,034.27 and 

₱12,562,191.86, respectively. Review of the reports submitted by the 

Accounting and Budget Divisions on the actual performance or work 

accomplishment in relation to the work targets of the Agency vis-à-vis the 

financial resources determined that the cause of underutilization are as follows:  

 

a) Unobligated MOOE Allotment – Regular Fund of ₱21,521,034.27

10.11. The Development of Policies, Standard and Guidelines program of the ECCD 
Council aimed to address equity, inclusion of the disadvantaged/marginalized 

groups, improve quality life among children and families and ensure 

effectiveness in the implementation of program components. This involves 

study of culture and belief systems that influence the curriculum, approaches in 

teaching and learning systems and collaborative partnership among national 

and local government agencies, non-government organizations, families, and 

communities. On the other hand, Capacity Building pertains to human resource 

development program through its different modes of trainings which targeted 

not only the child development teachers and workers but also their supervisors, 

the City/Municipality Social Welfare Development Officers. 

 

10.12. Most of the activities under these two PAPs have allocated funds for venue and 
equipment rentals, accommodations, food and transportation services, 

brochure, campaign and training materials and tuition fees with partner 

universities/schools, which the Agency failed to utilize due to restrictions 

imposed by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of 

Emerging Infectious Diseases of the National Government to limit the spread 



87 

 

of COVID-19. According to Management, they had implemented some training 

programs through alternative mode of delivery, wherein trainings and seminars 

are conducted through webinars (Zoom and Facebook live) and blended 

(modular and online) learning. On the advocacy materials, instead of actual 

printing/reproduction, they had developed a series of digital advocacy materials 

such as infographics, e-posters, and videos to support parents/families and other 

ECCD service providers, thus generated savings. 

 

10.13. However, the Program Implementation Review (PIR) (Detailed Report 
Attached as Annex H) results showed that the full attainment of the objectives 

for the Capacity Building and Institutional Development of Stakeholders and 

other Partners may not be fully achieved by the participants from various 

geographical areas in the country due to internet connectivity issues and the 

individual's self-learning management as compared to face-to-face training 

wherein the participants could rely on lecturer/administrator for full guidance 

and support on the discussion of the module content. Further, some of the target 

participants were unable to attend the trainings because they were already 

engaged/pre-occupied with COVID-19 response programs and activities being 

implemented in their LGUs. 

 

10.14. The ECCD Council’s Radio Program, Radyo Bulilit, was supposed to be 
renewed with Radyo Pilipinas for another season but the contract did not push 

through due to COA findings. The ECCD Council attempted to find other 

possible partners within budget such as Southeast Asian Ministers of Education 

Organization (SEAMEO) and the Official Radio Station of the University of 

the Philippines (DZUP). Unfortunately, both stations were not able to 

accommodate the program due to lack of manpower and airtime slot. Moreover, 

because of the Pandemic, the Council was not able to personally scout more 

possible partners and eventually decided to push through with a new program 

that will be produced by the Council itself in 2021. 

 

10.15. While the total allocated budget of ₱84,600.00 for accreditation of ECCD 
Council Service Providers which showed zero or low utilization for the past 

years, remained underutilized by ₱44,834.00 or 53 percent in CY 2020 due to 

non-implementation of licensing/ registration/ accreditation/ monitoring of 

ECCD Council Service Providers since CY 2014. According to Management, 

accreditation/recognition activities were suspended due to continued temporary 

closure of schools and learning centers and the public health risks of face-to-

face activities.  

 

b) Unobligated MOOE Allotment – SAGF of ₱12,562,191.86 
 

10.16. The MOOE allocation in the Special Fund for the Agency’s program, 
establishment of NCDCs and conversion of existing DCCs to CDCs in various 

LGUs to be sourced from the contributions of PAGCOR and in accordance with 

RA No. 10410, had an unutilized balance of ₱12,562,191.86. The fund was

10.17. As of December 31, 2020, ECCD Council reported a utilization rate of 90.69 
percent or the equivalent of ₱122,417,808.14 of the aforesaid programs/projects 

and administrative expenses, as presented below:

10.18. As can be gleaned from the table above, the Travelling Expenses with a net 
unobligated allotment of ₱9,473,559.35 is where the big chunk of the 

underutilized fund comes from. These are also due to the travel restrictions 

imposed by the National Government to limit the spread of COVID-19, hence 

the planned face-to-face initial meeting/conference with LGUs Officials 

regarding the establishment of NCDCs and monitoring of ongoing projects, 

including site inspection, visitation and final inspection were not conducted by 

the Agency personnel in CY 2020. 

 

10.19. According to the Management, to ensure the continuation of good quality 
monitoring and evaluative work while respecting and sustaining the national 

efforts to limit the spread of the virus and respond to the Pandemic, the 



89 

 

Agency’s NCDC Unit devised an internal “Guidance Note for NCDC Project 

Monitoring Under the New Normal” wherein the large part of data collection 

and project status monitoring is being done remotely, using various methods 

and tools e.g., table monitoring, virtual conference and orientation and 

submission of reports through internet via emails or Facebook Messenger. The 

Agency had furnished the Audit Team copy of said Guidance Note, however, 

the actual result/report for this new monitoring and evaluation process, which 

could have shown the effectiveness of the new measures implemented by the 

Agency, is not yet submitted to the Audit Team.  

 

10.20. Furthermore, the unobligated allotment of ₱3,088,632.51 under the Other 
Professional Services was due to unfilled vacancy of Procurement Head 

position for six months and the discontinued hiring of additional engineers 

under the NCDC Unit due to the Pandemic. However, the number of additional 

positions and the amount of salaries were not reflected in the Agency’s Work 

and Financial Plan and the Agency’s CY 2020 APP remained unsubmitted, thus 

the Audit Team was not able to validate the reasonableness of the unobligated 

allotment. 

 

10.21. In addition, the Agency received a total of ₱226,230,000.00 NCAs for the 
period covered January 1 to December 31, 2020, of which an amount of 

₱153,528,687.22 or 67.86 percent was disbursed, while ₱72,701,312.78 or 

32.14 percent had lapsed and reverted to the BTr. Details are presented below:

10.22. The Audit Team acknowledges the challenges brought about by the Pandemic 
and its effects in fully utilizing the Agency’s authorized budgetary and cash 

requirements with its continued efforts to deliver the outputs under the new 



90 

 

normal. However, unobligated allotments and lapsed NCAs existence during 

the year are not a sound management practice in the effective and efficient 

utilization of its available resources. With this, the Council’s mandate in 

promoting quality delivery of integrated ECCD Programs by both the public 

and private Centers to Filipino ages 0-4 is not fully achieved, depriving all its 

stakeholders of the maximum benefits from these programs. 

 

10.23. We recommended, and Management agreed, to: 
 

a. maximize the utilization of the allotments and NCAs received within 
the period of its validity to ensure that the optimum results and benefits 

derived from the funds would be realized;  

 

b. observe efficiency in the implementation of the programs/activities/ 
projects to fully achieve the objectives and address the needs of its 

intended beneficiaries; 

 

c. intensify the hiring of the unfilled Contract of Service (COS) positions 
for the Procurement and NCDC Project Units through publication of 

the vacant positions; and 

 

d. present a catch-up action plan including interventions on the programs 
with unutilized allotments in FY 2020. 

 

10.24. Management acknowledged that the substantial amount of unutilized allotment 
was due to the restrictions brought by the Pandemic, thus chargeable training, 

travelling and other professional services expenses did not materialize as 

originally planned. They committed to prioritize the implementation of 

programs with significant unutilized allotments in FY 2021 and the hiring of 

additional COS personnel whose services will not require out-of-town travels 

under the current restrictions.

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

12. The implementation of the GAD related PAPs of ECCD Council had various 
lapses such as: a) the appropriated amount of ₱2,459,630.00 is 4.27 percent or 

less than five percent of its adjusted annual budget of ₱57,627,000.00; b) the 

GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) includes ₱900,000.00 provision for contingent 

activities or “other services,” which is among those expenses not allowed to be 

charged thereto,  contrary to GP of the GAA for FY 2020 and Section 6.1 of 

Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01 of Philippine Commission on Women (PCW)-

National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA)-DBM effective 

January 2013; and c) out of ₱2,459,630.00 approved GPB, only ₱851,379.27 or 

34.61 percent was utilized due to partial/non-implementation of the  target GAD 

PAPs caused by the Pandemic and non-occurrence of contingent activities, 

thereby resulting in underutilization of GAD funds and partial/non-attainment 

of GAD objectives for the year. 

 

12.1. Section 31 of the GP of the GAA for FY 2020 provides that all agencies of the 
government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues 

within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable 

provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women (MCW), 

Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against 

Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-

Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan 

(2017-2022).  

 

12.2. The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies which 
shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budget appropriations, which is also 

required in Section 6.1 of Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01 of PCW-NEDA-

DBM effective January 2013. Utilization of GAD budget shall be evaluated 

based on the GAD performance indicators identified by the said agencies. 

 

12.3. Annex A of JC No. 2012-01 of PCW-NEDA-DBM effective January 2013 
provides guidelines in completing the GPB template. It states that the primary 

consideration is the clearness of gender issue being addressed by the expense 

or activity and provides the sample list of expenses allowed and not allowed to 

be charged to the GAD Budget.  



92 

 

12.4. PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2020-01 dated April 27, 2020 also provides 
guidance on the revision and/or implementation of the FY 2020 GAD Plan and 

Budget to implement GAD PAPs that address gender issues and concerns 

related to the COVID-19 situation.  Such measures should be in line with their 

respective agency mandates, MCW, and Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.  The 

computation of the minimum five percent (5%) GAD budget shall be based on 

the total adjusted budget of the agency following NBC No. 580.   

 

12.5. The revised GPB of the ECCD Council for CY 2020 showed that a total of 
₱2,459,630.00 was appropriated for GAD related PAPs. The amount represents 

4.27 percent of its adjusted annual budget following NBC 580 of 

₱57,627,000.00, which is less than the minimum requirement of five percent 

(5%) required by the GP of FY 2020 GAA and Section 6.1 of JC No. 2012-01 

of PCW-NEDA-DBM effective January 2013. The GPB budget is lower by 

₱421,720.00.  

 

12.6. Further, CY 2020 GAD Accomplishment Rreport (AR) disclosed that the total 
amount of ₱851,379.27 or only 34.61 percent of the approved budget, has been 

utilized for GAD thru programs and projects that integrated gender perspective 

in the operations of the Agency, as summarized in the table below:

12.7. As can be gleaned from the table above, the underutilization was attributed 
mainly to the partial/non-implementation of PAPs related to provision for 



93 

 

Antigen/Rapid test, RT-PCR test, and COVID-19 vaccine for employees with 

an unexpended balance of ₱835,000.00 or 51.92 percent of the overall 

unutilized amount.  
 

12.8. It was observed, however, that due to the uncertainty of occurrence or 
incurrence of these expenses in CY 2020, the ₱900,000.00 budget set aside for 

these purposes may be categorized as contingency funds or “other services,” 

which is among expenses not allowed to be charged to GPB as provided in 

PCW-DILG-DBM-NEDA Joint Memorandum Circular No. 2012-01 effective 

2013. Further, the NGAs are authorized to use their appropriated budget for 

activities related to the Agency’s mandate and any departure from such requires 

special approval from the DBM. The LGUs, in coordination with DOH, are 

tasked to administer the testing of persons who are under investigation/infected 

with COVID-19 virus and the roll-out of vaccine, thus in the absence of existing 

guideline authorizing other NGAs to set aside their GAA fund specifically for 

COVID-19-related expenses such as testing and vaccine for their employees, 

may result in an irregular transaction. 
 

12.9. Moreover, the Agency also failed to maximize the use of allocated budget for 
the conduct of month-long National Women's Month Celebration, Out of Office 

Planning, and Budgeting Sessions, online seminar/webinar related to COVID-

19 Pandemic impact to workplace and ECEP due to restrictions brought by the 

Pandemic, wherein an aggregate excess budget of ₱773,250.73 or 48.08 percent 

of the overall unutilized amount was noted. 

 

12.10. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. provide a budget and integrate its regular PAPs for GAD equivalent to 
at least five percent (5%) of the Agency’s total appropriation in 

accordance with Section 31 of the GP of the GAA for FY 2020 and 

Section 6.1 of JC No. 2012-01 of PCW-NEDA-DBM effective January 

2013; and 

 

b. instruct the GAD Focal Point System/Person to refrain from including 
provision of contingency funds or other services of PPAs in the GPB 

and ensure that the identified GAD Programs and activities are gender- 

responsive. 

 

12.11. The Management commented that the original total GPB of the Council for FY 
2020 submitted to PCW amounted to ₱6,554,579.50, which is equivalent to 

11.37 percent of the Council’s adjusted budget of ₱57,627,000.00. The Agency 

had included in this Plan four major programs of the Council as part of the 

Attributed Programs. However, upon review of PCW Specialist, only one 

program passed for attribution, which resulted in an approved amount of 

₱2,459,630.00 or 4.27% of the adjusted budget of the Council. On the other 

hand, the inclusion of the activities related to COVID-19 Pandemic was the 

result of the issuance of PCW Memo Circular No. 2020-03 dated April 27, 2020 



94 

 

re: Adjustment and/or Implementation of the FY 2020 GPB in view of the 

Coronavirus Disease 2019 Situation. This Circular enjoined all national 

government agencies and instrumentalities to review and revise, as necessary, 

their FY 2020 GPB to implement measures to address gender issues and 

concerns arising from the unequal status of their women and men stakeholders 

due to COVID-19 situation. Moreover, the Management explained that the low 

utilization of GPB approved amount is due to the late approval of the Agency’s 

plan. In addition to this, the issuance of PCW Memo Circular No. 2020-03 dated 

April 27, 2020 had also brought about delays in the endorsement of the Revised 

2020 GPB of the Council since it was only endorsed on October 1, 2020. 

 

Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability 

 

13. The ECCD Council complied with Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA 
No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020 in the implementation of programs/projects 

and plans for senior citizens and differently-abled persons. 

 

13.1. Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, the GAA for FY 2020, 
states that: 

 

“All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs 

and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and 

persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated 

functions and integrate the same in their regular activities. 

 

Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall 

provide architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that 

will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons 

with disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA No. 

7277.” 

 

13.2. One of ECCD Council’s materials/documents is the “Standards and Guidelines 
for Center-Based Early Childhood Programs for 0 to 4-Year-Old Filipino 

Children”. This material explicitly states different guidelines in ensuring 

activities and programs that will include and safeguard the rights of children 

with disability. This document was rolled-out through trainings and orientations 

to different stakeholders who also include senior citizens serving the 

government and other private child development centers. For 2020, the 

trainings/seminars on the new Standards and Guidelines conducted by ECCD 

Council included topics also emphasizing the concerns of senior citizens and 

persons with disabilities (PWDs).  

 

13.3. All the continuing programs of the ECCD Council for the capacity building of 
the ECCD Council Service Providers were offered to and attended by different 

age levels including senior citizens during the Agency’s 2020 run of programs. 

These programs included the “Leading and Managing an Integrated ECCD 



95 

 

Program (LMIEP)” for City/Municipal Social Welfare and Development 

Officers, and ECEP, the “Induction Programs" for the Child Development 

Workers and other trainings requested by public and private sectors related to 

the different ECCD programs.  Some of these programs were participated in by 

PWDs. Similarly, strategies on handling children with special needs were also 

taught in the different training programs for teachers of the NCDC and DCCs. 
 

13.4. The ECCD Council continued to monitor the compliance of LGUs in the 
standard detailed engineering design, technical specification as well as the 

program of works for the construction of NCDCs specifically to include 

facilities for persons/children with disabilities such as disability ramps with 

stainless steel railing located at the entrance area of the constructed centers, 

grab rails inside the adult toilets of NCDCs and sufficient space for wheelchairs. 

Also included in the monitoring of compliance are the DCCs which were part 

of the rehabilitation or conversion program of the Council. 
 

13.5. We commended Management for its continuous support and 
implementation of programs benefitting senior citizens and PWDs.
