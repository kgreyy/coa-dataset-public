PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



A)	Financial Audit



Unadjusted accounting errors/omissions and uncorrected accounting deficiencies



1)	A qualified opinion was rendered on the Financial Statements due to various accounting errors/omissions amounting to ₱3.154 million and accounting deficiencies such as absence of subsidiary ledgers on 120 accounts and unaccounted difference in the Due to BIR with an aggregate amount of ₱998.303 million which exceeded the materiality level of ₱3.275 million which prevented alternative audit procedures to be undertaken to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence relating to various assertions on the accounts.



Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 provides that “Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position; financial performance, and cash flow of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs.”

In view of the errors/omissions amounting to ₱3.154 million and various accounting deficiencies such as absence of subsidiary ledgers on 120 accounts and unaccounted difference in the Due to BIR with an aggregate amount of ₱998.303 million which exceeded the materiality level of ₱3.275 million which prevented alternative audit procedures to be undertaken to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence relating to various assertions on the accounts, a qualified opinion was rendered on the Financial Statements.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant to effect the necessary adjustments on the errors/omissions with the corresponding supporting documents and to correct the noted deficiencies.





B)	 Compliance with Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements



High fund utilization/obligation rate



2)	Overall, the agency’s fund utilization/obligation of ₱156.638 million is 97.66 percent compared to its appropriation/allotment of ₱160.388 million. Also, it registered a utilization rate of 96.78 percent or ₱94.591 million due to savings on procurement and austerity measures being implemented by the agency for its major program, Fertilizer and Pesticide Regulatory Program, which were utilized in accordance with the purpose of the appropriation/allotment of ₱97.741 million.



Low cash utilization/disbursements



3)	Of the total Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) of ₱243.397 million received during the year, 84.71 percent or ₱206.186 million was utilized/disbursed with a balance of ₱37.211 million which was reverted to the National Treasury due to discontinuance of appropriated “Programs, Activities and Projects (P/A/Ps)” for second quarter and late submission and incomplete documentation of disbursement, hence, payment could not be processed.



Section 3.11.3 of the National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 577 provides that: “The Monthly Disbursement Program (MDP) or Budget Execution Documents (BED) No. 3, as evaluated by Department of Budget and Management (DBM), shall serve as the basis for the release of disbursement authorities including the comprehensive NCA covering the full year cash requirements of the agency for its regular operating requirements.”



Moreover, DBM Circular Letter (CL) No. 2019-3 dated January 4, 2019 sets out the guidelines for the crediting of the NCA to be used for the operations of all agencies of the government as well as its validity, to wit:



2.1 All NCA Releases for Regular MDS Sub-Accounts, to be credited for any month, whether part of the comprehensive release or constituting additional NCA releases, shall continue to be valid until the last working day of the 3rd month of the quarter covered.



2.3 	It is understood that all NCA balances of regular MDS Sub-Accounts at the end of each quarter are considered lapsed after the last working hours of said quarter.



Section 1.3 of the NBC No. 580 dated April 22, 2020, directed the discontinuance of appropriated programs, projects or activities of any agency of the Executive Department, in the Fiscal Years (FYs) 2019 and 2020 General Appropriations Act (GAAs), including unreleased appropriations and unobligated released allotments. Among the purpose of the Circular is to provide for the possible measures for the discontinuance of appropriated P/A/Ps, whether released or unreleased as well as unobligated allotments of covered entities, to fund the operations and response measures related to the COVID-19 emergency situation.



Overall cash utilization/disbursement as of December 31, 2020 is as follows:

For CY 2020, FPA received NCA amounting to ₱243.397 million and utilized/disbursed the amount of ₱206.186 million or equivalent to 84.71 percent utilization rate, leaving an unutilized amount of ₱37.211 million which were automatically reverted to the National Treasury.



Management commented that the reversal of unutilized NCAs was due to: (i) delays in the transmittal of claims by the Regional Field Offices of FPA due to the lockdown and community quarantine imposed in connection to COVID-19 pandemic; (ii) procurement of the Capital Outlay originally programmed at the second quarter was not executed due to the non-availability of items in the Procurement Service-DBM; (iii) discontinuance of identified programs, activities and projects programmed for second quarter  due to the issuance of NBC No. 580; and (iv) late submission and incomplete documentation of disbursement vouchers in FPA Central Office, thus, the delay in the processing of transactions.



Due to the above deficiencies, the expected benefits from the P/A/Ps funded from the government funds were not fully realized to the disadvantage of the intended beneficiaries.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	instruct all Regional Field Offices to immediately submit the Disbursement Vouchers with complete supporting documents to the Accounting Section to facilitate its payment before the quarterly reversion will take place and to avoid reversion of fund; and



b)	fast track the procurement process and ensure that all procurement activities and implementation of programs are within timelines set in the implementation of agency programs to comply with the Cash Budgeting System pursuant to EO 91.



Reversion of dormant cash, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary fund



4)	The agency has no dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds and related accounts for reversion as of year-end, in conformity with Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012, dated September 11, 2012, implementing EO No. 431, dated May 30, 2005. All fees, charges, assessments, and other receipts or revenues collected, trust receipts and performance bonds and deposits, among others, except as unauthorized by law to be returned by the agency for its use, were deposited/remitted to the National Treasury pursuant to Section 4 to 14 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA (Receipts and Income).



Granting and liquidation of cash advances



5)	Cash advances during the year for operating expenses, official local and foreign travels and special purpose time bound undertakings amounting to ₱1.021 million were granted and liquidated in accordance with COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997.There were no unliquidated cash advances in prior years.

Non-liquidation of fund transfers to implementing agencies 



6)	Fund transfer to NGAs during the year for the implementation of the agency’s projects amounting to ₱59.000 million or 100 percent of the funds transferred were not liquidated. Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years amounting ₱3.000 million or 66.67 percent of the prior year’s balance of ₱4.500 million contrary to COA Circular No.94-013. 



COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 sets forth the rules and regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to implementing agencies are as follows:

The funds transferred to the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) amounting to ₱59.000 million was made on March 13, 2020 for the construction of six-storey Laboratory building of FPA. One of the terms and conditions stated in the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was that the project should commence on June 13, 2020 and should be completed on September 5, 2021, hence, the liquidation of the fund transfer is not yet due. The construction had already started, as of year-end.



On the other hand, the prior year’s balance of ₱3.000 million at the end of the year pertains to transferred funds of ₱4.500 million to five (5) LGUs in CY 2018 for the implementation of Organic Fertilizer Development Program for the distribution of composting facilities for biodegradable wastes (CFBW) to qualified LGUs. Hence, to ensure the proper implementation of the program, Special Order No. 51 dated March 28, 2018 was issued by the Executive Director of FPA creating the Organic Fertilizer Development Program Project Committee composed of project advisors, project monitoring committee, finance committee and secretariat. Among the functions of the project monitoring committee is to monitor/validate the program implementation while for the finance committee is to monitor the disbursement of funds in the implementing agencies. 



Validation of the program implementation made by the monitoring committee, disclosed that four of the five LGUs have already established their CFBW as of June 2019. LGU Caloocan has received its procured machine this 4th quarter of CY 2020 only. Based on the submitted status report of the monitoring committee on the program implementation, the procurement and establishment of the composting facility has been done, hence, should have been liquidated as of the end of CY 2020, as stipulated in the MOAs.



As of year-end, only LGUs Morong, Rizal and Victoria, Laguna have submitted the Report of Disbursements. This year, another follow up was made by the Accountant from the other three (3) LGUs, however, to date, no reply was received. The Report of Utilization and the unutilized amount of ₱0.030 million, which was inadvertently submitted and transferred to DA, RFU No. III by LGU Macabebe, Pampanga in 2019, was not taken up in the books of the FPA this year due to non-submission of Report of Disbursements and failure of the Accountant of DA, RFU No. III for the return of the unutilized fund transferred into their account despite constant follow ups made by the FPA Accountant.



During the year, coordination with the different LGUs on the utilization of the fund transfers resulted in the liquidation amounting ₱1.499 million or 33.31 per cent compared to prior year’s liquidation amounting to only ₱0.001 million.



This is a reiteration of prior year’s audit observation.







We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Finance Committee to:



a)	send formal notices requiring the concerned LGUs to immediately submit the RCIs and/or RDs and to return the unused funds, if any; and



b)	request the DA RO III Regional Director to instruct the Accountant to return the unutilized fund.



Granting and liquidation of fund transfers to PS-DBM



7)	Fund transfers to Procurement Service for its common office supplies and equipment requirement during the year amounted to ₱6.695 million, of which, items corresponding the amount of ₱3.582 million were delivered, leaving a balance of ₱3.112 million which are all current advances. The granting and liquidation thereof were in accordance with COA Circular No. 94-013. There were no unliquidated fund transfers in prior years.



Dormant receivables not requested for write-off



8)	Dormant receivable accounts amounting to ₱3,958.26 were not requested for write-off, as required under COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 prescribes the guidelines and procedures on the write-off of dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers of NGAs, LGUs, and GOCCs. Pertinent provisions are as follows:



“5.4 Dormant Receivable Accounts – accounts which balances remained inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for ten (10) years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.



Moreover, it provides that:



“8.2 The Head of the government entity shall file the request for authority to write-off dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers to the COA Audit Team Leader (ATL) and/or Supervising Auditor (SA).”



The dormant accounts amounting to ₱3,958.26 pertain to receivables from employees who are no longer connected with the agency, as presented below:

The FPA did not give due attention to these dormant accounts, hence, as of this date these remained in the books. The Accountant commented that the whereabouts of the debtors cannot be located due to lack of documents and information on the debtors’ addresses, thus, collectability is uncertain. 



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountant to request for authority to write-off the receivable accounts after complying with the documentary requirements and conditions set forth in COA Circular No. 2016-005. 



Insurance of physical assets with GSIS



9)	The agency insured with the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) property amounting to ₱197.483 million with corresponding insurance premiums paid in the amount of ₱0.677 million, in accordance with Republic Act (RA) No. 656, otherwise known as the “Property Insurance Law”, as amended by PD No. 245 dated July 13, 1973.



Non-disposal of unserviceable property



10)	Unserviceable property with book value of ₱10.157 million remained not disposed of, contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 1445, thus, exposing them to further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value.



During the year, the agency reported unserviceable Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) with a book value of ₱10.445 million. Of this amount, various office equipment amounting to ₱0.288 million were disposed of through public bidding on June 25, 2020 with proceeds of ₱0.003 million under Official Receipt (OR) No.5743420 dated June 25, 2020, leaving a balance of ₱10.157 million which remained undisposed of as of year-end.  Due to lack of personnel in the Property Section, the Inventory Committee, prioritized the conduct of the year-end physical inventory of PPE, hence, facilitation of appraisal of the remaining unserviceable PPE was not done. Details are as follows:

	

	Unserviceable PPE

	Book Value

	(In million Pesos)

	Motor Vehicles

	1.928

	Information and Communications Technology Equipment 

	2.899

	10.445

	Less Disposed unserviceable PPE – Office Equipment

	0.288

	Total Unserviceable PPE

	10.157

The non-disposal of said unserviceable PPE exposed them to further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value, contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 1445 which provides that:

	

			“When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence.  If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or duly authorized representative of the Commission, after advertising by printed notice in the Official Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of general circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the expense of publication, by notices posted for a like period in at least three public places in the locality where the property is to be sold. In the event that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned and approved by the Commission.”

	

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the OIC-Chief, General Services Section and Inventory Committee to:

	

a)	assign additional personnel in the Property Section to facilitate the appraisal and consequently disposal of the unserviceable property; and 

	

b)	expedite and facilitate the disposal of the remaining unserviceable PPE, in accordance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445, to prevent further deterioration and realize possible income therefrom.



Emergency Procurement Activities during a State of Calamity



11)	This year’s procurement of goods and services through negotiated (emergency purchase), amounting to ₱13.036 million were in accordance with Section 53.2 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulation (IRR) of RA No. 9184 (Procurement Law), which provides that:



“In case of imminent danger to life or property during a state of calamity, or when time is of the essence arising from natural or man-made calamities or other causes where immediate action is necessary to prevent damage to or loss of life or property, or to restore vital public services, infrastructure facilities and other public utilities. In the case of Infrastructure Projects, the Procuring Entity has the option to undertake the project through negotiated procurement or by administration or, in high security risk areas, through the AFP.”



Delayed/Non-submission of government contracts



12)	Of the total 151 government contracts submitted during the year, 95 contracts were found in order. However, copies of 56 government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents with corresponding amount of ₱7.026 million were not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from two to 95 days, inconsistent with Items 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009.



The following are the guidelines among others, on the submission of government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents and copies of delivery documents to wit: 



--	Sec. 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 states that “Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, xxx, a copy of said contract and each of all documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.”



--	Section 3.2.1 of the same COA Circular provides that “A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and every supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned.”



Audit disclosed that 53 approved government contracts and three Purchase Orders (POs) amounting to ₱7.026 million were not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from two to 95 days as of year-end which is inconsistent with the above cited regulation, as shown below:

The delays in submission of government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents increased by 37 days ranging from 2-95 days during the year compared to the average delays of 1-58 days in CY 2019.



Both the BAC and the Supply and Property Section informed that utmost efforts are being done for the timely submission of the required government contracts and POs, however, due to the alternative work arrangement of employees being implemented in the agency in this time of pandemic and the persons in-charge in the submission of such inadvertently forgot to submit the above government contracts within the prescribed period.



The delayed submission of the contracts/MOAs/JOs/POs and the corresponding supporting documents within the prescribed period prevented the audit team on the timely review, evaluation and generation of a relevant audit result on the transactions. Nonetheless, the 95 government contracts submitted were found in order.



This is a reiteration of prior years’ audit observation.



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the BAC and the Supply and Property Section to formulate a strategy or devise a plan for the staff to follow to ensure submission of the copy of approved contracts, MOAs, JOs and POs together with their supporting documents within the prescribed period.

Their salaries were charged against the Maintenance and Operating Expenses (MOOE) in the total amount of ₱9.669 million, as authorized under DBM Circular Letter (CL) No. 2013-5 dated July 22, 2013.



Non-allocation and/or utilization of fund for GAD programs/activities



18)	The FPA allocated only the amount of ₱0.209 million or 0.13 percent, far less than the five percent of its appropriations of ₱165.388 million for GAD-related activities inconsistent with Section 31 of the GAA for CY 2020. Also, the FPA did not furnish the Audit Team the PCW-endorsed GAD Plan and Budget and GAD Accomplishment Report for CY 2020, contrary to Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014, hence, utilization of GAD budget and evaluation of outputs/accomplishments on planned activities based on GAD performance indicators could not be made.

	

Section 31 of the GAA for FY 2020 provides that:

	

			“All agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination 0f All forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022)

	

	The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with the requirement. Utilization of GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.”

	

Item 8 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides that:

			

			“All government instrumentalities shall formulate their annual GPBs within the context of their mandates. The NGA shall submit the GPBs and the corresponding GAD Accomplishment Reports (AR) to the PCW for the latter’s review and endorsement to the DBM in accordance with PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2016-05. The PCW shall then acknowledge receipt of the GPBs and review the same and inform the agency of its comments or actions on the GAD plans. The PCW shall then endorse all revised GPBs and return these to the NGAs for their submission to the DBM. Upon receipt of the PCW-endorsed GPBs, the agency shall submit the same to the DBM along with their annual GAD Accomplishment Report for the previous year in accordance with the budget call. Once the GAA has been approved and where budget and program adjustments have to be made based on final agency budgets, the agency shall submit an adjusted GPB to the PCW. The adjusted GPB shall be the basis for implementing the GPBs as well as for monitoring and reporting.”

	

Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 states that, 

	

			“The Audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit Team assigned to the agency within five (5) working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the PCW or their mother or central offices as the case maybe.”

		

PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 provides under Item 7.0 that:



                “FY 2020 GAD ARs submitted to PCW shall be authenticated by the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) with a barcode. Concerned agencies shall print the GMMS-authenticated GAD AR for signature of their agency head and submit signed copies to PCW and their respective COA Audit Team.”

The accounting and budget records showed that only ₱0.209 million or 0.13 percent of the Agency’s appropriation of ₱165.388 million was allocated and spent by the FPA in the implementation of its GAD-related activities, which is far below the required five percent of allocation or ₱8.269 million, contrary to Section 31 of the General Provisions of GAA for FY 2020. The Focal Person commented that some planned programs and activities were not undertaken due to Management’s order to limit gatherings or activities this year due to the COVID pandemic, for this reason, the amount spent was far below the required five percent.

	

Moreover, the PCW-endorsed GPB and GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) for CY 2020 were not submitted to the Audit Team despite requesting submission of the same. The focal person informed that they submitted the GPB for CY 2020 to PCW for approval, however, the PCW did not return the endorsed GPB to the agency. It was also informed that due to her sudden designation as Officer in-Charge in the Finance Administrative Division she was not able to follow it up with the PCW, hence, the same were not submitted.	

		

Without the approved and PCW-endorsed GPB and Accomplishment Report for CY 2020, the outputs/accomplishments on planned activities could not be assessed. Similarly, evaluation on the utilization of GAD budget based on GAD performance indicators and compliance with existing regulations on GAD could not be made.

			

This is a reiteration of last year’s audit observation, only that the agency has complied to submit the AR of CY 2019.

		

We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations and Management agreed to:

	

a)	allocate at least five percent of the Agency’s appropriation for the conduct of GAD-related programs, projects and activities to maximize the agency’s contribution towards the attainment of the GAD intended purpose or objectives;

	

b)	coordinate and follow-up with PCW the reviewed and PCW-endorsed GPB and AR; and

	

c)	instruct the GAD Focal Person to strictly adhere to the deadlines set on the timely submission of GPB and AR with financial details to the Audit Team once approved/endorsed by the PCW.



Non-allocation and/or utilization of fund for SCPWD programs/activities



19)	For CY 2020, the FPA spent ₱0.052 million in the implementation of the activities for the Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability (SCPWD), in addition to providing ramps, a wheelchair and priority lane for them.  However, the FPA did not formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of SCPWD pursuant to Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020. Moreover, the Work and Financial Plan (WFP) and Annual Accomplishment Report (AR) were not submitted to the Audit Team, thus, hindered this Office to conduct an evaluation of activities undertaken if it has fully achieved the objective for which the program was designed.



Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 provides that, “All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of SCs and PWDs, in so far as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrated the same in their regular activities”.



Noteworthy for CY 2020, the FPA has designated an official/focal person, on October 15, 2020, who shall be responsible for the planning and implementation of the Economic Independence Program for Persons with Disabilities in compliance to Rule III, Section 2.1 of the IRR of Executive Order No. 417 which directs all national government agencies, except those not mandated by Executive Order No. 417, including their attached bureaus or offices and local government units shall assign an official who shall serve as the focal person responsible for the planning and implementation of the Economic Independence Program for Persons with Disabilities.



However, this year, the Agency did not formulate plans, programs and projects for SCPWD to comply with the aforementioned provision. As such, the Work and Financial Plan (WFP) and Accomplishment Report (AR) were neither prepared nor submitted. 



The non-preparation of plans, programs and projects and similarly the absence of WFP and AR hinder the audit team from conducting an evaluation of activities undertaken if it has benefited the SCPWD and if it has fully achieved the objectives for which the program was designed. 



This is a reiteration of last year’s audit observation, whereas, of note the AR of CY 2019 was furnished the audit team.



We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation and Management agreed to instruct the focal person to formulate plans, programs and projects intended for SCPWD to address their concerns and integrate the same in their regular activities as required in Section 32 of the GAA for FY 2020 and similarly, submit the WFP and AR with full financial details on the activities conducted for evaluation and assessment.



Implementation of ODA Funded Projects

20)	The FPA did not receive and disburse funds for the implementation of Official Development Assistance (ODA) Funded projects.



Receipt and utilization of Disaster Related Fund



21)	The agency did not receive and disburse funds for the Disaster Risk Reduction Management Fund and/or Quick Response Fund. 







Audit suspensions, disallowances and charges



22)	Of the ₱0.556 million audit disallowance for prior years, ₱0.018 million was settled, leaving an unsettled amount of ₱0.538 million, due to lax enforcement by management of full settlement of disallowance within the six-month period as prescribed under Section 10.4 of COA Circular 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009. No Notices of Suspensions (NSs), Notices of Disallowance (NDs) and Notice of Charge (NCs) were issued during the year.



COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 prescribes the use of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) in which among others particularly in Chapter III states the guidelines in the issuance of AOM/NS/ND/NC/NSSDC and SASDC.



Section 7, Chapter II of the RRSA provides the responsibilities for audit and settlement of accounts, as shown below:



7.1.1	The head of the Agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: (a)xxx; (b) the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within the prescribed period; (c) the requirements and transactions suspended in audit are complied with; xxx



 7.1.2	The head of the Agency shall initiate the necessary administrative and/or criminal action in case of unjustified failure/refusal to effect compliance with the foregoing requirements by subordinate officials. Gross negligence in disciplining subordinates who are the subject of repeated adverse audit findings shall subject the officials concerned to disciplinary action by the proper authorities as the evidence may warrant.



Section 22.1 – a decision of the Commission Proper (CP), Adjudication and Settlement Board (ASB), Director or Auditor upon any matter within their respective jurisdiction; if not appealed as herein provided, shall become final and executory.



The total disallowances of various transactions as of December 31, 2020 as well as the settlement during the year, is summarized as follows:

The beginning balance of ND pertains to the disallowance of ₱0.556 million in CY 2019 of two FPA employees, who are still active and connected with the agency, one of the employees settled his liabilities thru partial voluntary payment in the amount of ₱0.018 million during the year, while the other employee filed an appeal to the COA.



The balance of the audit disallowances amounting to ₱0.538 million as of year-end remained unsettled due to lax enforcement by management of full settlement of disallowances within the prescribed time. 



NDs issued prior to the effectivity of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) amounting to ₱2.632 million are not included in the reflected balance but are deemed disallowances/charges which shall continue to be enforced in accordance with these Rules as provided under Section 28 thereof. Said amount pertains to disallowances of officers and employees who are no longer connected with FPA for more than 10 years. Demand letters were sent, however, some were returned to sender and others had no reply, hence, making the settlement of the same difficult, or even, impossible.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	give due regard to the decision that would be issued by the Commission Proper on the appeal pertaining to the ND Nos. 19-002-101(17-18) and 19-003-101(17) dated September 10, 2019 and November 27, 2019, respectively; and



b)	require the concerned person liable to refund the amount disallowed as regards ND No. 19-001-1019 (2018-2019) dated July 30, 2019, since there was no appeal made and an NFD was already issued.
