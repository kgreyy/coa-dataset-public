	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

	

	

A)	Introduction



The Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA) was created on May 30, 1977 by virtue of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1144 with the mandate of regulating, controlling and developing the fertilizer and pesticide industries. It is tasked to assure the agricultural sector adequate supply of fertilizer and pesticide at reasonable prices, rationalize the manufacture and marketing of fertilizer, protect the public from the risks inherent in the use of fertilizer and pesticides, and educate the agricultural sector in the use of these inputs. It was formerly an attached agency of Department of Agriculture (DA). By virtue of Executive Order (EO) No. 165 dated May 5, 2014, FPA was transferred to the Office of the President. On September 17, 2018 under EO No. 62, the supervision of FPA was returned to the DA.



The FPA is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of seven officials from seven government agencies under Other Executive Offices. The Executive Director leads the FPA operations, with five Divisions and 12 Field Units headed by Regional Officers (ROs) reporting directly to the Executive Director. The five FPA Divisions are: Fertilizer Regulations Division (FRD), Pesticide Regulations Division (PRD), Finance and Administrative Division (FAD), Laboratory Services Division (LSD) and Planning, Management and Information Division (PMID).



The FPA is presently headed by Executive Director Wilfredo C. Roldan.  As of year-end, 146 of the 159 authorized plantilla positions were filled-up. In addition, the regular positions of FPA were complemented by 48 individuals hired under Contract of Service (COS), for a total workforce of 194. Details are shown below:

For CY 2020, FPA has total Regular Appropriation of ₱157.498 million, Automatic Appropriation of ₱2.129 million, and Special Purpose Fund of ₱5.761 million or a total of ₱165.388 million. Total allotment of ₱160.388 million consists of Agency Specific Budget, Automatic Appropriations, Special Purpose Fund and Continuing Appropriations amounting to ₱151.649 million, ₱2.129 million, ₱5.266 million and ₱1.344 million, respectively.



A state of national emergency was declared under Republic Act (RA) No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act (Bayanihan Act One) which was approved on March 24, 2020, in view of the adverse effect and serious threat of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) to health, safety, security and livelihood of the Filipinos. In order to sustain COVID-19 response and recovery interventions by the government, RA No. 11494 or the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act (Bayanihan Act Two) was approved on September 11, 2020. To facilitate the country’s response to the pandemic, the Congress, through RA No. 11469, granted emergency powers to the President which include but not limited to realignment from savings on other items of appropriations in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 General Appropriations Act (GAA) in the Executive Department to fund measures that address and respond to the COVID-19 emergency and on March 28, 2020,  a Memorandum of the Executive Secretary was issued to the DBM Secretary to direct the discontinuance  of appropriate programs, projects or activities of any agency of the Executive Department, hence, the difference of ₱5.000 million between the allotment and the appropriation of the agency. Since the FPA did not receive funds in line with Bayanihan Act One and Bayanihan Act Two, the FPA considered realignment/modifications of budget/allotments to accommodate COVID related transactions sourced out from existing object of expenditures of the regular budget of the agency to facilitate the agency’s response to the pandemic.



C)	Scope of Audit and Objectives 



		The audit covered the accounts, transactions and operations of FPA for CY 2020. The audit was conducted to (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.

		

D)	Independent Auditor’s Report 



	A qualified opinion was rendered on the CY 2020 financial statements of FPA due to various accounting deficiencies with an aggregate amount of ₱998.303 million which exceeded the materiality level of ₱3.275 million and unadjusted accounting errors/omissions amounting to ₱3.514 million and are discussed in detail in Part II of this report.

	

E)	Significant Observations and Recommendations



1)	Of the total Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) of ₱243.397 million received during the year, 84.71 percent or ₱206.186 million was utilized/disbursed with a balance of ₱37.211 million which was reverted to the National Treasury due to discontinuance of appropriated “Programs, Activities and Projects (P/A/Ps)” for second quarter and late submission and incomplete documentation of disbursement, hence, payment could not be processed. (Observation No. 3)



We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	instruct all Regional Field Offices to immediately submit the Disbursement Vouchers with complete supporting documents to the Accounting Section to facilitate its payment before the quarterly reversion will take place and to avoid reversion of fund; and



b)	fast track the procurement process and ensure that all procurement activities and implementation of programs are within timelines set in the implementation of agency programs to comply with the Cash Budgeting System pursuant to EO 91.



2)	Fund transfers to NGAs during the year for the implementation of the agency’s projects amounting to ₱59.000 million or 100 percent of the funds transferred were not liquidated. Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years amounting to ₱3.000 million or 66.67 percent of the prior year’s balance of ₱4.500 million contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013. (Observation No. 6)



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Finance Committee to:



a)	send formal notices requiring the concerned LGUs to immediately submit the RCIs and/or RDs and to return the unused funds, if any; and



b)	request the DA, RFU III Regional Director to instruct the Accountant to return the unutilized fund.



3)	Unserviceable property with book value of ₱10.157 million remained not disposed of, contrary to Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, thus exposing them to further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value. (Observation No. 10)



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the OIC-Chief, General Services Section and Inventory Committee to:

	

a)	assign additional personnel in the Property Section to facilitate the appraisal and consequently disposal of the unserviceable property; and 

	

b)	expedite and facilitate the disposal of the remaining unserviceable PPE, in accordance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445, to prevent further deterioration and realize possible income therefrom.

	

4)	Of the total 151 government contracts submitted during the year, 95 contracts were found in order. However, copies of 56 government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents with corresponding amount of ₱7.026 million were not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from two to 95 days, inconsistent with Items 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009. (Observation No. 12)



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the BAC and the Supply and Property Section to formulate a strategy or devise a plan for the staff to follow to ensure submission of the copy of approved contracts, MOAs, JOs and POs together with their supporting documents within the prescribed period. 

	The observations and recommendations were discussed with agency officials in an exit conference conducted on April 22, 2021. Management comments were considered in the report, where appropriate.



F)	Enforcement of Settlement of Accounts



Of the ₱0.556 million audit disallowance for prior years, only ₱0.018 million was settled, leaving an unsettled amount of ₱0.538 million, due to lax enforcement by management of full settlement of disallowance within the six-month period as prescribed under Section 10.4 of COA Circular 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009.  No Notices of Suspensions (NSs), Notices of Disallowance (NDs) and Notice of Charge (NCs) were issued during the year.



For disallowances amounting to ₱2.632 million issued prior to the effectivity of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts (RRSA), no settlement was made during the year.



G)	Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations

	

	Out of 31 prior year’s audit recommendations, 14 were implemented and 17 were not implemented by Management as of December 31, 2020, of which 14 were reiterated in Part II of this report.
