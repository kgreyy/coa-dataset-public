PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)	Financial and Compliance Audit



1)		Dormant Accounts Receivables and Advances to Officers and Employees amounting to P3,509,341.28 and P179,092.27, respectively, aged 10 years and above were not requested for write-off contrary to COA Circular 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, thus affecting the fairness of presentation of the related receivable and equity account balances in the financial statements.

	

COA Circular 2016-005 provides guidelines and procedures on the write-off of dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers of National Government Agencies.



Items 5.4 and 5.5 define dormant Receivable Accounts and Unliquidated Cash Advances as follows:



“5.4 Dormant Receivable Accounts - accounts which balances remained inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for ten (10) years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.”



“5.5 Dormant Unliquidated Cash Advances - advances granted to disbursing] officers, agency ~officers and employees which remained non-moving for ten (10) years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.”



Our review of the Accounts Receivables of the College and scrutiny of the details in the Schedules of Accounts Receivables as of December 31, 2020, showed that the amount of P3,509,341.28 and P179,092.27  were included in the Accounts Receivables and Advances to Officers and Employees, respectively, which had been dormant for more than 10 years  and with remote possibility of collection.  

 

	The account “Accounts Receivables” represents students’ tuition and other fees.  Out of the P41,672,750.55, reflected in the financial statements at year-end, 8.42% or P3,509,341.28 has remained outstanding and uncollected for 10 years or more because these accounts belonged to dropout students or those who were not able to return to school for the next school year.  Although there was no written demand to oblige the students to settle their remaining obligations, the students with existing accountability could not get any credentials from the Registrar’s Office unless they first settle their accounts.  



	





The Accountant said that he will coordinate first with the Registrars of the four CHMSC campuses to discuss the status of the students.  He will be requesting write off only for the accounts aged 10 years and above of drop out students.  However, the dormant accounts of those who have already graduated shall not be requested for write off since the CHMSC still has the chance of collecting the unpaid balance from them.



On the other hand, the balance of the Advances to Officers and Employees amounting to P179,092.27  (please see Annex A for details) pertain to the accounts of persons who were already separated from the service due to retirement, reassignment or even death.



Interview with the Accountant disclosed that the dormant accounts were not requested for write off due to the non-availability of necessary records/documents, and the Accounting Office had difficulty in sending demand letters to those who were already retired or resigned because their whereabouts are no longer known.  

		

Considering that the foregoing accounts may already be dormant pursuant to COA Circular 2016-005, continuously carrying these in the books may affect the presentation of the related receivable and equity accounts in the financial statements. Thus, after exerting diligent efforts and management has sufficient proof that the possibility of collection is already nil, they may request from the Commission on Audit (COA) for authority to write-off these dormant accounts in accordance with the guidelines prescribed in the said COA Circular.



We recommended and Management, thru the College President, agreed to require the Accountant, after showing proof that all means to collect has been exhausted to no avail, to request for authority from the Commission on Audit to write-off the dormant accounts in accordance with the guidelines prescribed in COA Circular No. 2016-005.





2)		The cost of major repairs and betterments of school buildings and other structures amounting to ₱408,990.62 and ₱6,334,215.00 respectively were directly charged to expense contrary to Sections 24, 24(b) and 25, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) Volume I, thus affecting the fairness of presentation of the financial statements at year-end.



Section 24, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I categorizes repairs and maintenance into minor and major repairs.  Minor repairs shall be directly charged to the expense account “Repairs and Maintenance” while major repairs shall be added to the carrying amount of the PPE and shall be depreciated over the remaining life of the PPE. 











Moreover, Sections 24(b) and 25 of the same Manual establish the criteria determining when such is capitalized or directly expensed as follows:

	

	“Section 24(b) - Parts of some items of PPE may require recurring replacement such as a road needing resurfacing every few years or non-recurring replacement such as replacing the interior walls of a building. Under the recognition principle, an entity recognizes in the carrying amount of an item of PPE the cost of replacing part of such an item when that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met. The carrying amount of those parts that are replaced is derecognized” 

	

“Sec. 25. Betterments.  Betterments are enhancements to the future economic benefits or service potential of a capital asset, such as:



a. an increase in the previously assessed physical output or service capacity;

b. a reduction in associated operating costs;

c. an extension of the estimated useful life; or

d. an improvement in the quality of output.”  (Underscoring Ours)



The aforementioned section also states that the cost incurred for repairs and betterments of the existing Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) should be capitalized when the amount is material and it results in the increase in future economic benefits. 



Our post-audit of the transactions of Carlos Hilado Memorial State College (CHMSC) in CY 2020 revealed that the disbursements for the repairs and betterments of existing school buildings and other structures amounting to ₱408,990.62 and ₱6,334,215.00 (See Annex B for details), respectively, were directly charged to expense under the account “Repairs and Maintenance- Buildings and Other Structures”.



However, records showed that the cost of repairs for school buildings and other structures was for the replacement of the old ceiling amounting to ₱408,990.62 and since the cost incurred substantially exceeded the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00, these should have been recognized as a major repair to be capitalized.



The Audit Team also noted that the repairs amounting to P290,460.00 involved enhancements of a certain structure and conversion of the same from one purpose to another. For instance, the old clinic was improved into a crime laboratory.  The enhancements and conversion resulted to increase in the future economic benefits or service potential that is expected to be derived from its use and should also have been capitalized.





The Accountant informed the Audit Team that he admittedly could not identify the cost of repairs, whether it was major which had to be capitalized or minor which could be directly charged to expense.  He further explained that as a matter of practice, all repairs were immediately taken up as expense.



Furthermore, verification of the books of accounts disclosed that the prior year’s cost for betterments of the school building, still in the process of construction up to date, which was initially recorded as Construction in Progress, was adjusted in CY 2020 as follows:



Accounts

Debit

Credit

Repairs and Maintenance Expense- B&OS

2,056,546.31



                Construction in Progress



2,056,546.31



The Accounting Staff explained to the Audit Team that the adjustment was made because they thought that it was erroneously recorded to the Construction in Progress account instead of expense.  However, since the cost of repairs involves a material amount and will result to increased future economic benefits, the previous entry made was correct, thus, the adjustment made in the current year should be reversed.



 	As a result of the direct charging to expense accounts of the foregoing transactions, instead of its capitalization and subsequent recognition as expense in the form of depreciation, and the erroneous adjusting entry, the expense and PPE account balances were overstated and understated, respectively, thereby affecting the fairness of presentation of the financial statements at year-end.



 We recommended and Management, thru the College President, agreed to direct the Accountant to prepare adjusting entries to properly record the incurrence of major repairs and betterments of school buildings and other structures and reverse the erroneous adjusting entry.



Henceforth, the Accountant should identify the cost of repairs and betterments of Property, Plant and Equipment, its materiality and future economic benefits so that proper charging to the appropriate accounts can be made.





















3)		Purchases of inventories held for sale amounting to ₱2,024,460.00 were directly charged to expense contrary to Section 7, Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) Volume I, thus affecting the fairness of presentation of the financial statements at year-end.



Section 2, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Vol. I considers inventories as an asset when it is held for sale in the ordinary course of operations. Furthermore, Section 7 of the same Manual provides that:



“When inventories are sold, exchanged, or distributed, their carrying amount shall be recognized as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. If there is no related revenue, the expense is recognized when the goods are distributed or the related service is rendered.” (Underscoring Ours)

	

Post-audit of the disbursements of Carlos Hilado Memorial State College (CHMSC) disclosed that the purchase of 4,140 sets of P.E. uniforms at P489.00 per set totaling ₱2,024,460.00 per check no. 401163 dated February 6, 2020, intended for sale under its Income Generating Project (IGP), was directly recorded to the Cost of Sales account.



Moreover, the records of the Business Affairs Office (BAO) for the P.E. uniforms inventory in CY 2020 showed the following:





 Quantity (sets)

Beginning Inventory

Less:  Sales during the year 

2,657

1,299,273.00

Ending Inventory 

1,483

₱     725,187.00



The BAO facilitates the sale of PE Uniforms at P650.00 per set to the students, as one of the income generating projects of the CHMSC and submits a quarterly report to the Accounting Office as their basis to take up the cost of goods sold. 



The Audit Team interviewed the Accountant on the immediate recording of expense on the purchases of PE Uniform and he said that it is solely for convenience.  He explained further that he although initially recorded it as an expense, an adjusting entry was made, at year-end, upon receipt of the report from the BAO, to set up the actual ending inventory by debiting the Inventory Held for Sale account and crediting the Cost of Sales account.  





However, verification of the financial records revealed that there was no such adjusting entry made at year-end. We noted that only the following entry was made to record the purchase of uniforms for sale:



Accounts

Cost of Sales

₱2,024,460.00

Nevertheless, the following entries should have been recorded:

 

A)	Upon purchase of 4,140 sets of P.E. uniforms at P489.00 per set

₱2,024,460.00

1,299,273.00



     Sales Revenue



₱1,727,050.00

     Inventory Held for Sale



1,299,273.00



Since the purchases were recorded as a direct expense instead of to the Inventory Held for Sale account, the asset account was understated by ₱725,187.00 representing the cost of the ending inventory at year-end and also overstated the Accumulated Surplus account by the same amount, thereby affecting the fairness and presentation of the financial statements.



We recommended and Management, thru the College President, agreed to direct the Accountant to prepare adjusting entry to properly establish the Inventory Held for Sale Account.



Henceforth, the Accountant should recognize the Inventory Held for Sale account upon purchase and record the expense only when the items are sold pursuant to the pertinent rules of inventory. 











4)		Liquidated damages and retention money amounting to P498,581.66 and P499,858.30, respectively, were not deducted from payments to the contractor contrary to Section 68 of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184 and Items 6.1, 6.2, 8.1 and 8.3, Annex “E” of its Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (R-IRR), thus, excessive disbursements in the total amount of P998,439.96 were incurred.

	

	Section 68 of R.A. No. 9184 and Items 8.1 and 8.3 Annex “E” of its Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (R-IRR) contain the following provisions on Liquidated Damages:



1)	“Section 68. Liquidated Damages. - All contracts executed in accordance with this Act shall contain a provision on liquidated damages which shall be payable in case of breach thereof. The amount thereof shall be specified in the IRR.”

	

2)	Item 8.1, Annex “E” of R.A. No. 9184’s R-IRR:



“Where the contractor refuses or fails to satisfactorily complete the work within the specified contract time, plus any time extension duly granted and is hereby in default under the contract, the contractor shall pay the procuring entity for liquidated damages, and not by way of penalty, an amount, as provided in the conditions of contract, equal to at least one tenth (1/10) of one (1) percent of the cost of the unperformed portion of the works for every day of delay. (Underscoring Ours) 



3)	Item, 8.3 Annex “E” of R.A. No. 9184’s R-IRR:



	“To be entitled to such liquidated damages, the procuring entity does not have to prove that it has incurred actual damages. Such amount shall be deducted from any money due or which may become due the contractor under the contract and/or collect such liquidated damages from the retention money or other securities posted by the contractor whichever is convenient to the procuring entity.” (Underscoring Ours) 

























In our post audit of the project pertaining to the construction of driveway and parking lot in the CHMSC, Fortune Towne Campus, Bacolod City, we noted that although the contractor incurred a very significant delay, no liquidated damages were imposed as shown in the following details:

₱4,998,583.00

	

The construction of the foregoing project was for a 60-day contract period starting on December 27, 2018 up to February 17, 2019. However, the contractor, Wilkinson Construction, was not able to complete the project on the specified target date and instead, incurred a 222-day delay.  Thus, the Project Management Team (PMT) responsible for preparing all documents to support the payments to contractors, recommended the imposition of liquidated damages (LD) amounting P498,581.66.  The Audit Team reviewed the computation of the recommended LD and found it to be correct, as follows:

	

LD = P4,998,583.00(contract price) x 44.93% (unfinished portion)      

      = P2,245,863.34 x 1/10% x 222 days

      = P498,581.66



The Computation Sheet of the LD was among the documents submitted by the PMT to the Accounting Office to support the final payment to the contractor.  However, we noted in post-audit that the LD was not deducted by the Accounting Office on the final payment to the contractor for the 100% accomplishment as of September 27, 2019.



Further review of the disbursement vouchers related to the said project revealed that the Accounting Office did not also deduct the corresponding retention money of P499,858.30 (10% of P4,998,583.00 of contract price).  We noted that for the first and final progress billing for 55.07% and 100% work accomplishment, respectively, retention money was not deducted at all, nor did the contractor submit a bank guarantee which is contrary to Items 6.1 and 6.2, Annex E of the R-IRR of the RA 9184 which states:

















1)	Item 6.1, Annex “E” of R.A. No. 9184’s R-IRR:



“Progress payments are subject to retention of ten percent (10%) referred to as the “retention money.  Such money shall be based on the total amount due to the contractor prior to any deduction and shall be retained from every progress payment until fifty percent (50%) of the value of works, as determined by the procuring entity, are completed. xxx”(Underscoring Ours)



2)	Item 6.2, Annex “E” of R.A. No. 9184’s R-IRR:



“The total “retention money” shall be due for release upon final acceptance of the works.  The contractor may, however, request the substitution of the retention money for each progress billing with irrevocable standby letters of credit of from a commercial bank, bank guarantees or surety bonds callable on demand, of amounts equivalent to the retention money substituted for and acceptable to Government, provided that the project is on schedule and is satisfactorily undertaken.  Xxx”(Underscoring Ours)



The Manual of Procedures for the Procurement of Infrastructure Projects defines retention money as the amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the progress payments, before deductions are made, that is withheld by the Procuring Entity to cover the uncorrected discovered defects and third party liabilities.  It is due for release after the defects liability period, upon final acceptance of the works.  To date, no final acceptance of the project has been issued because it was inadvertently overlooked. 



The Audit Team interviewed both the Accountant and the person in charge of preparing the disbursement voucher (DV) and they both said that the LD and retention money were inadvertently overlooked by them.  The Accountant explained further that because he has confidence in the competence of the person in charge, he did not review the computation anymore.  



The person in charge of preparing the DV acknowledged the error made and assured the Audit Team that she will make the necessary arrangements with Wilkinson Construction that the LD of ₱498,581.66 will be deducted from the unreleased retention money from its other infrastructure projects with the CHMSC.



	On the other hand, the Management Audit Analysis (MAA) who reviews the correctness and validity of the transactions prior to the President’s approval explained to the Audit Team that she did not also notice that there was no LD imposed inspite of the fact that there was a Computation Sheet attached to the DV.  







It is undisputed, in this case, that the contractor failed to perform the contracted works within the period stated in the contract by incurring a 222-day delay without even requesting for an extension.  Therefore, when the contractor fails to finish the works within the period agreed upon without any justifiable reason, the liability for damages as a result of such default arises. Liquidated damages are not considered as a penalty but a means of compensation for the breach of the contract.  It is to be deducted at the rate and manner provided by law.  



The failure of the CHMSC to deduct the liquidated damages and retention money from the payments made to the contractor resulted to the incurrence of excessive disbursements amounting to P498,581.66 and P499,858.30, or a total of P998,439.96.  Moreover it was disadvantageous to the government because it sends off the wrong signal that the College condoned the breach made by the contractor on his contract and allowed the latter to be free of his obligation for defects and third party liabilities.



We recommended and Management, thru the College President, agreed to demand from the contractor the liquidated damages of P498,581.66 which were not deducted from the latter’s claims, otherwise, the same shall be disallowed in audit.  He should also instruct the Accountant to henceforth, thoroughly review all the payments made to contractors to ensure that liquidated damages and retention money are properly deducted therefrom in compliance with R.A. No. 9184 and its R-IRR. 





5)		Payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay to contractors of security and janitorial services and also to officials, employees and job order personnel amounting to ₱359,100.00 and ₱112,300.00, respectively, was not in accordance with Items 3.6, 4.1, 4.3 and 4.4 of Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Budget Circular (BC) No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020, thus resulting to unauthorized disbursements of public funds. 



DBM BC No 2020-1 provides that Administrative Order (AO) No. 26 authorizes the grant of COVID- 19 Hazard Pay, in an amount not exceeding ₱500.00 per day per person, to government employees and workers engaged through contract of service (COS) or job order (JO) basis who physically report for work during the implementation of an Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ).



Items 3.6, 4.1, 4.3 and 4.4 of the aforementioned BC provide guidelines and conditions on the coverage for the grant of the COVID-19 hazard pay, as follows: 



	Item 3.6-



“Workers engaged through COS, JO, or other similar schemes”. (Emphasis ours)







Item 4.1 



The COVID-19 Hazard Pay to be granted shall not exceed ₱500.00/day per person, which shall be computed as follows: (Emphasis ours)

----media/image1.png----



	



Item 4.3- 



“The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official working hours by the head of agency/office during the period of implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine measures in the area of such office of work station.”  (Emphasis ours)



Item 4.4- 



 “The total rate of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay shall be based on the number of days an employee/worker physically reports for work during the Enhanced Community Quarantine period using the formula under Item 4.1 hereof.” (Emphasis ours)



At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire Province of Negros Occidental, by virtue of Executive Order (EO) No. 20-20, series of 2020 issued by the Provincial Governor, was placed under ECQ starting 12:01 am of March 30, 2020 until 11:59 pm of April 14, 2020.  The ECQ was extended until 11:59 pm of April 30, 2020 per Provincial Governor, EO No. 20-20-A Series of 2020.



Our post-audit of the Carlos Hilado Memorial State College’s (CHMSC) disbursements revealed that payments of COVID-19 Hazard Pay from the period                March 20 to April 15, 2020 were made to the following contractors or service providers of security and janitorial services, as follows:

In relation to the preceding paragraph, Item 6.0 of the Civil Service Commission (CSC), Commission on Audit (COA) and DBM (JC) No.1 s. 2017 dated June 15, 2017 enumerates and distinguishes different forms of COS such as the Institutional COS, Individual COS, and Job Order (JO). 



It can be inferred, therefore, in application of the legal maxim of statutory construction — expressio unius est exclusio alterius, that the express stipulation in Item 3.6 of DBM BC No. 2020-1 of the word JO, despite being one the forms of COS, right after the word COS, establishes the intention of the author of the circular to not include all types of COS.  Moreover, Item 1.0 of the same Joint Circular states that the COVID-19 Hazard pay shall be granted to “government employees and workers” but institutional COS are not considered as government workers because they are hired by the private agency which was contracted by the government to provide manpower services.  Thus, it is in no way similar to the Individual COS or JOs who are directly hired by the government agency concerned.



Item 6.1.4 of CSC-COA-DBM JC No. 1 s.2017 further provides:



“The contractor or service provider shall be responsible for providing the workers with compensation and benefits compliant with the existing labor law including the necessary social security and other benefits mandated by law in addition to the direct compensation as payment for their services”. (Underscoring Ours)



	We reviewed the contracts between CHMSC and its janitorial and security service providers and noted that there is no stipulation obliging the CHMSC to grant benefits to Institutional COS workers because the contract only includes, among others, the following:



a)		Salary;

b)		Mandatory Contributions-Employer Share (SSS Premiums Philhealth Contributions, and    Pag-ibig fund);

c)		Other Benefits (13th Month Pay and 5 days Incentive Pay); and

d)		Night Shift Differential.

	

Our interview with the Vice President for Administration and Finance disclosed that CHCMSC granted COVID-19 hazard pay to the Institutional COS workers, since they were physically present for the maintenance of the College during the ECQ, exposing them to health risks and hazards.



We emphasize that the grant of other benefits, unless required by law, is a managerial prerogative of the employer over its employees. However, in this case, the institutional COS workers are not considered as employees of CHMSC, thus, the payment it made to the respective contractors or service providers despite the fact that the Institutional COS workers are not covered by the DBM BC No. 2020- 1 to be one of the grantees of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay, is without any legal basis.

	Further, post-audit of the disbursements for COVID-19 hazard pay showed that the total amount of ₱112,310.00 (please see Annex C for details), was paid to CHMSC officials/employees and job order personnel for the period March 17-29 and May 1-15, 2020.  However, since the Province of Negros Occidental was placed under ECQ only for the period March 30 to April 30, 2020, the personnel concerned were not entitled to the payment of hazard pay before and after the ECQ period.

	

	We also noted that there were erroneous computations of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay, particularly payments made to drivers.  The drivers, who rendered more than 8 hours of service a day, were paid more than ₱500.00/day.  For instance, those who served from 4 am to 11 pm, which is more than 16 hours, on a single day were computed two days of hazard pay which is contrary to the aforecited Item 4.1 which states that the COVID-19 hazard pay shall not exceed ₱500.00/day per person. Thus, the computation is on a per day basis and not on the number of hours rendered.



The staff of the Human Resource Management Office (HRMO) explained that in their interpretation of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay, the employee must physically report to the Office and render at least eight hours a day to avail the full amount of ₱500.00/day.  In their interpretation, if an employee renders 16 hours within the day, it would already be equivalent to two days COVID-19 Hazard Pay, and if the service rendered is less than eight hours in a day, the hazard pay is pro-rated accordingly. 



	The Head of the HRMO also revealed that the CHMSC granted COVID-19 Hazard Pay to its Officials/Employees and JO starting on March 17, 2020 because DBM BC 2020-1 took effect beginning March 17, 2020.  However, we are also reminding the management that even if the DBM Circular took effect on March 17, 2020, the grant of the COVID-19 Hazard pay is authorized only during the implementation of the ECQ which in the case of the Province of Negros Occidental, took effect at 12:01 AM of March 30, 2020 and not on March 17, 2020.

 

We recommended and Management, thru the College President, agreed to require the contractors or service providers of security and janitorial services and all the concerned personnel to immediately refund the payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay otherwise, the same shall be disallowed in audit and to henceforth ensure that all disbursements of public funds are in accordance with written guidelines issued by proper authorities.



















6)		Payment of Magna Carta Hazard Pay to the designated College Nurse amounting to P90,642.82 was not supported with complete documentation contrary to Item No. 5.8 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, thus the validity of the transactions could not be determined.



Item 5.8 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribes the documentary requirements for the payment of Hazard Pay, enumerated as follows:



a)	Certification by the Secretary of Department of Health (DOH) that the place of assignment/travel is a disease-infested/distress or isolated areas/station (for Public Health Workers);

b)	Duly Accomplished time record of employees or travel report;

c)	Copy of special order from the agency/department head covering the assignment to hazardous/difficult areas; and

d)	Approved DTR/Service Report	



Our verification of the disbursements of the Carlos Hilado Memorial State College (CHMSC) for CY 2020 showed that the amount of P90,642.82 was paid to the faculty designated as  College Nurse assigned at CHMSC, Fortune Towne Campus.  The payment under ADA No. 12-008-2020-1204 dated December 16, 2020 covered the period April 16, 2018 to April 15, 2020 or during the tenure of her designation as College Nurse.



Perusal of the Disbursement Voucher and its supporting documents disclosed that the payment was supported only by the letter request of the Head of the Human Resource Management Office (HRMO) and the Vice President for Administration and Finance (VPAF) to the College President requesting approval for the grant of Hazard Pay to the designated Nurse.  The other documentary requirements prescribed in Item 5.8 of COA Circular No. 2012-001were not attached especially the Certification by the Secretary of the DOH that the place of assignment is a disease-infested/distressed or isolated area/ station.



The Certification from the Secretary of DOH, as a requirement for the payment of Hazard Pay is also restated under Item 3.1 of Department of Budget and Management and Department of Health Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2016 dated July 15, 2016, which reads as follows:  



“As a general compensation policy, and in line with Section 21 of RA No. 7305, Hazard Pay may be granted to PHWs if the nature of their duties and responsibilities, their actual services, and location of work, expose them to great danger, occupational risks,  perils to life, and physical hardships, as determined by the Secretary of Health, or by the Head of the Agency or the Local Chief Executive, with the approval of the Secretary of Health.” (Underscoring Ours)







The Head of HRMO informed the Audit Team that she overlooked to request a Certification from the Secretary of DOH but will facilitate it immediately. 



The mere letter-request from the Head of HRMO and VPAF cannot satisfy what is required under the rules and regulation on the grant of Hazard Pay to Public Health Workers.  Thus, the absence of a Certification from the Secretary of Health indicating that the nature of her work exposes the College Nurse to great danger for which she is allowed to claim Hazard Pay, as well as the other required supporting documents makes the validity of the disbursement doubtful. 



We recommended and Management, thru the College President, agreed to direct the Head of the HRMO to expedite the request for the Certification from the Secretary of Department of Health and also require the Designate Nurse to submit the Approved DTRs covering the period April 16, 2018 to April 15, 2020.  Henceforth, the Accountant should strictly comply with the documentary requirements prescribed in COA Circular No. 2012-01 dated June 14, 2012 and other pertinent rules and regulations on the grant of Hazard Pay.  





7)		Three (3) infrastructure projects with an aggregate contract cost of P112,573,665.97 were not carefully planned contrary to Section 2 of the Government Procurement Manual, Volume 3 and Section 17.6 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9184 which caused significant delays in project completion and deprived the College the use of new school buildings and facilities.

	

	Section 2 of the Government Procurement Manual, Volume 3 discusses the procedures related to preparation for the procurement of infrastructure projects.  It emphasizes the importance of planning because it provides higher efficiency and efficacy and enables the procurement officials to anticipate the onset of events and gives them the opportunity to choose the best course of action to ensure that desired results are optimized at the least possible cost.  It also discusses the three basic activities of preparing for procurement which are:  (1) procurement planning, (2) preparation of bidding documents and (3) conduct of pre-procurement conference.



	As stated in the Manual, the purpose of procurement planning is “for the Procuring Entity to schedule its procurement activities in advance, consistent with its approved budget and its target date of implementation”.  And for infrastructure projects, the appropriate timing/phasing of project activities such as engineering and design and acquisition of right of way to reduce project costs, among others, shall be considered.













	In addition, the importance of detailed engineering is provided in Section 17.6 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (R-IRR) of R.A. 9184, as follows:



“No bidding and award of contract for Infrastructure Projects shall be made unless the detailed engineering investigations, surveys and designs, for the project, have been sufficiently carried out and duly approved in accordance with the standards and specifications prescribed by the HOPE concerned or his duly authorized representative, pursuant  to the recommendation of the end-user or implementing unit and in accordance with the provision of Annex ”A” of this IRR.  Xxx”



	We reviewed the Report on Program, Project and Activities (PPA) of the College and noted that there were three (3) projects whose completion was delayed, as follows:

Our review of the contract and its supporting documents and post-audit of the disbursement voucher pertaining to the foregoing projects showed that the contractors had sent letter requests to the Board of Trustees (BOT) for time suspension and time extension, all of which were approved.  One of the common reasons for the contractors’ request for extension was the delayed demolition of existing structures in the construction site.



Further verification by the audit team showed that the demolition permits for the 4-storey 20 Classroom Academic Building and the 3-storey Academic Building were processed by the CHMSC officials concerned only on February 2018 and were approved by the Office of the Building Official, Bacolod City on March 16, 2018 and April 8, 2018, respectively.  For the project Design and Build for the Upgrading of Post-Harvest Laboratory, the demolition permit showed no date of approval by the Office of the Building Official, Municipality of Binalbagan but it was notarized on February 28, 2020 or a month after initial project implementation.  





Gleaned from the foregoing, it is evident that the demolition permits were processed and approved only after the project was initially started.  However, best construction practices dictate that in the conduct of procurement planning for these infrastructure projects, the procuring entity should have taken into consideration the need to demolish the existing structures on the construction site and should have secured the demolition permit prior to awarding the contract.  



We were also informed by the Head of the Project Management Team (PMT) that the COA inspection of the existing structures prior to demolition was also delayed but our records show that the a COA Technical Audit Specialist had indeed rendered an inspection report on the first two projects.  For the Design and Build project, due to the imposition of Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ), inspection by the COA Technical Audit Specialist was no longer possible and the PMT should have coordinated with the Audit Team in this regard instead of just waiting for the COA’s inspection before demolition.



Due to the lack of proper procurement planning and thorough detailed engineering on the part of the Office of the Physical Plant Development and Management (PPDM) which is in charge of planning infrastructure procurement, significant delays were incurred and the projects were not completed within their target completion dates.  Thus, the College was deprived of the use of new school buildings and facilities.  Moreover, as discussed in another Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM), the government had incurred excessive disbursements because liquidated damages were not deducted from the contractor’s claims.



We recommended and Management, thru the College President, agreed to instruct the Head of the PPDM Office to henceforth, observe proper procurement planning activities and thorough detailed engineering in order to avoid delays in project implementation and to follow-up the completion of the Design and Build for Upgrading of Post-Harvest Laboratory Project which was supposed to be completed last March 4, 2021 but is still on-going to date.  





8)		Bangus fry sales amounting to ₱51,750.00 were not dropped from the Asset account and no corresponding disclosure was made contrary to Section 10(h) Chapter 11 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) Volume I, thus affecting the fairness of presentation of the Consumable Biological Assets and Accumulated Surplus account balances at year-end.



Section 2(f), Chapter 11 of the GAM for NGAs defines Consumable Biological Assets, as those “held for harvest as agricultural produce or for sale or distribution at no charge or for a nominal charge as biological assets. Examples of consumable biological assets are animals and plants for one-time use such as livestock intended for the production of meat, livestock held for sale, fish in farms, crops such as maize and wheat, and trees being grown for lumber.”(Emphasis Ours)





Moreover, Section 10(h), Chapter 11 of the same Manual provides disclosure requirements on Biological Assets, as follows:

 

“An entity shall present a reconciliation of changes in the carrying amount of biological assets between the beginning and the end of the current period. 



The reconciliation shall include:



4. Decreases attributable to sales and biological assets classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale) in accordance with the relevant international or national standard dealing with non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations.” (Emphasis Ours)

	Review of the year-end Financial Statements revealed that the Consumable Biological Assets account balance amounting to ₱51,750.00 remained unchanged from December 31, 2016 to date.  Our verification of the original transactions showed the following details:

Purchase of Bangus Fry for Fishpond



₱51,750.00





	Interview with the project-in-charge of the Binalbagan Campus’ Income Generating Project (IGP) disclosed that the bangus fry purchased were intended to be cultivated and sold upon harvest. He added that in 2017, the bangus, upon attainment of harvestable specifications, were actually sold. 



Query with the Accounting staff revealed that the sale of bangus was recorded by debiting the Cash Collecting Officer and crediting the Sales on Fishery Production accounts, but no corollary entry was made to reflect the resulting decrease in the Consumable Biological Assets account and the corresponding Cost of Goods Sold.



	We verified that the entry made to record the sales of bangus, covered by various Official Receipts on May 2017, as follows:



Accounts

   Debit

   Credit



Cash Collecting Officer

439,323.00



     Sales on Fishery Production



         439,323.00





 The entry to take up the sales was correct, however, in addition, the following entry should have been made to take up the expenses made upon the sale of the bangus:



Accounts

Debit

Credit



Cost of Goods Sold

51,750.00



     Consumable Biological Assets



         51,750.00

 

	Gleaned from the foregoing, it is noted that the entry made by the Accountant did not credit the Consumable Biological Account for the sale of the bangus, thereby overstating the same. We also noted that there was no related disclosure in the Notes to Financial Statements for the past years to date; thus, the subject account in the financial statements may not be fairly presented. 



We recommended and Management, thru the College President, agreed to direct the Accountant to prepare adjusting entry to properly record the sale of the harvested Bangus and henceforth, prepare the disclosure requirement on the Biological Assets as provided under Section 10(h), Chapter 11 of GAM for NGAs.





9)		Unexpended balances of Priority Development Assistance Funds (PDAF) as of December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱107,567.00 were not remitted to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr), thus, depriving the government of additional funds that could have been used for other government priority projects. 



Supreme Court Decision in Greco Antonious Beda Belgica, et al., vs. Paquito Ochoa, Jr., et al., G.R. No. 208566; Social Justice Society President Samson Alcantara vs. Franklin Drilon, G.R. No. 208493: Pedrito Nepomuceno, etc., vs. President Benigno Simeon Aquino III, et al. , G.R. No. 209251, all dated November 19, 2013, declared PDAF as unconstitutional in view of the inherent defects in the rules within which it operates,  thereby requesting the immediate return of the remaining balance of PDAF to the BTr.



In view thereof, the Supreme Court ordered all government agencies with existing PDAF to stop its disbursements or release and to return the same to the national coffers.



We verified from the Accounting records and noted that the Carlos Hilado Memorial State College (CHMSC) received PDAF from the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) on July 1, 2013 for the tuition fee of the students.   Out of the funds received, only ₱92,443.00 was expended in the same year, leaving a balance of ₱107,567.00.  











However, our analysis of the year-end financial statements showed that the unexpended balances of PDAF amounting to ₱107,567.00 still remained in the books for over seven years and were not yet returned to the BTR despite repeated verbal instructions of the audit team to the College Accountant to comply with the aforementioned Supreme Court decision.  This deprived the government of additional funds that could have been used for other government priority projects.

	

The Accountant said that he was not able to remit the unexpended balance of PDAF because he simply forgot to do so due to his voluminous workload.  However, he assured the audit team that he will process the immediate remittance of the PDAF as soon as possible. 



We recommended and Management, thru the College President, to require the Accountant to immediately return the unutilized PDAF balance amounting to ₱107,567.00 to the Bureau of Treasury in compliance with the Supreme Court decision declaring the PDAF as unconstitutional. 



	During the exit conference, the Accountant said since the PDAF was deposited to their MDS account, the remaining balance of ₱107,567.00 had already been reverted to DBM but he was not able to make an adjusting entry for the return of funds.  He said further that he will supply the Audit Team of the necessary documents and adjusting entry shall be made in CY 2021.





10)		The fidelity bonds of two Cashier were not sufficient to cover their total accountability for the period covered by their respective bonds, contrary to Items 5.1, 7.3 and 7.3.2 of Treasury Circular No. 02-009 dated August 6, 2009, thus, exposing the College’s funds to unsecured possible losses. 



Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009 provides the rules and   regulations governing the fidelity bonding of accountable public officers.



  Item 5.1 thereof requires that:



“The amount of bond shall be based on the total accountability (cash, property and accountable forms) of the accountable public officer as determined by the Head of Agency. Provided, the individual maximum accountability of each accountable public officer shall not exceed One Hundred Million Pesos (P100M).xxx.” 













Furthermore, Items 7.3 and 7.3.2 of the same circular provide guidelines upon occurrence of subsequent increase in accountability, as follows:



Item 7.3-



“Any increase in the amount of accountability, resulting to an increase in the amount of bond shall be subject to increase in premium” 



Item 7.3.2- 



“The amount of bond premium shall be computed based on the increased amount of bond. The bond shall take effect upon the time of payment of premium on the new bond application”



We verified the fidelity bond details of the concerned Cashier of the Binalbagan and Talisay Campuses and noted the following:

Our examination of the subsidiary ledgers pertaining to the concerned accountable officers’ collections and disbursements revealed that their total average accountability within the effective period covered by their fidelity bond exceeded the maximum cash accountability of their approved bond, shown as follows:



Accountable Officer

Per Audit

750,001.00 to1,000,000.00

18,539,355.27

3,500,000.00



The Campus Cashiers contended that the amount of bond, which is ₱500,000.00, is the amount applied since their initial assumption up to date. It is inferred, therefore, that despite the subsequent increase in the accountable officer’s total actual accountability, the amount of bond remains unchanged.

 As provided in Item 4.8 of the aforementioned treasury circular, the Fidelity Fund shall be available for the purpose of replacing defalcations, shortages, unrelieved losses in the accounts of bonded public officers, for the payment of fees and cost incident to civil proceedings brought against them to recover sums paid on their account from said Fund.  Thus, insufficient bond coverage places the government at a disadvantage in the unlikely event that the aforementioned conditions arise because the existing bond of the accountable officer may not be enough to replace any possible losses.



We recommended and Management agreed that the College President increase the bond of the Campus Cashiers to cover their average maximum cash accountability and to henceforth ensure that they are always properly bonded in accordance with Items 5.1, 7.3 and 7.3.2 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009.





B)	COMPLIANCE WITH TAX LAWS



	The Carlos Hilado Memorial State College complied with tax laws on the withholding of taxes from salaries, wages and other services, as well as Value-Added-Tax from purchases of goods and services which were remitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue.  





C)	COMPLIANCE WITH GSIS, HDMF AND PHILHEALTH REGULATIONS



The College withheld during the year premiums accruing to GSIS, HDMF and Philhealth and these were all remitted in accordance with the pertinent regulations of GSIS, HDMF and Philhelath.





D)	STATUS OF SUSPENSIONS, DISALLOWANCES AND CHARGES



The status of suspensions and disallowances as of December 31, 2020 is shown as follows:
