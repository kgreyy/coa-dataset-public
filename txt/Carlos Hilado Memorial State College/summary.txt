A)	Introduction



The Carlos Hilado Memorial State College (CHMSC) is a public educational institution that aims to provide higher technological, professional and vocational instruction and training in science, agriculture and industrial fields as well as short term or vocational courses.   It is a leading institution in higher and continuing education committed to engage in quality instruction, development-oriented research, sustainable lucrative economic enterprise, and responsive extension and training services through relevant academic programs to empower a human resource that responds effectively to challenges in life and act as catalyst in the holistic development of a humane society.

It was formerly known as the Paglaum State College which in the year 1983 by virtue of  Batas Pambansa Bilang 477 three institutions of learning were integrated into a tertiary state educational institution namely, the Negros Occidental College of Arts and Trades (NOCAT) in the Municipality of Talisay, Bacolod City National Trade School (BCNTS) in Alijis, Bacolod City; and the Negros Occidental Provincial Community College (NOPCC) also in Bacolod City. 

The administrative seat of this first state college in Negros Occidental was located                    at the five-hectare Talisay Campus which was originally established as Negros Occidental School of Arts and Trades (NOSAT) under RA No. 848, authored and sponsored by Hon. Carlos Hilado.

The renaming of the college to Carlos Hilado Memorial State College was effected by virtue of House Bill No. 7707, authored by then Congressman Jose Carlos V. Lacson of the 3rd Congressional District, Province of Negros Occidental, which finally became a law on May 5, 1994. 

The College is governed by its Board of Trustees, headed by                                                               Dr. Norberto P. Mangulabnan, College President and assisted by the Vice President for Academic Affairs, Vice President for Administration and Finance and Vice President for Research and Extension.

The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) ascertain the propriety of financial transactions and compliance to prescribed laws, rules and regulations (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the financial statements of CHMSC for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the exceptions stated in the Independent Auditor’s report discussed in Part II of the report.





F)	Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



The following are the significant observations with the corresponding recommendations:



1)		Dormant Accounts Receivables and Advances to Officers and Employees amounting to P3,509,341.28 and P179,092.27, respectively, aged 10 years and above were not requested for write-off contrary to COA Circular 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, thus affecting the fairness of presentation of the related receivable and equity account balances in the financial statements.

	

We recommended and Management, thru the College President, agreed to require the Accountant, after showing proof that all means to collect has been exhausted to no avail, to request for authority from the Commission on Audit to write-off the dormant accounts in accordance with the guidelines prescribed in COA Circular No. 2016-005.









2)		The cost of major repairs and betterments of school buildings and other structures amounting to ₱408,990.62 and ₱6,334,215.00 respectively were directly charged to expense contrary to Sections 24, 24(b) and 25, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) Volume I, thus affecting the fairness of presentation of the financial statements at year-end.



We recommended and Management, thru the College President, agreed to direct the Accountant to prepare the adjusting entries to properly record the incurrence of major repairs and betterments of school buildings and other structures and reverse the erroneous adjusting entry.



Henceforth, the Accountant should identify the cost of repairs and betterments of Property, Plant and Equipment, its materiality and future economic benefits so that proper charging to the appropriate accounts can be made.



3)		Purchases of inventories held for sale amounting to ₱2,024,460.00 were directly charged to expense contrary to Section 7, Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) Volume I, thus affecting the fairness of presentation of the financial statements at year-end.



We recommended and Management, thru the College President, agreed to direct the Accountant to prepare adjusting entry to properly establish the Inventory Held for Sale Account.



Henceforth, the Accountant should recognize the Inventory Held for Sale account upon purchase and record the expense only when the items are sold pursuant to the pertinent rules of inventory. 



4)		Liquidated damages and retention money amounting to P498,581.66 and P499,858.30, respectively, were not deducted from payments to the contractor contrary to Section 68 of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184 and Items 6.1, 6.2, 8.1 and 8.3, Annex “E” of its Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (R-IRR), thus, excessive disbursements in the total amount of P998,439.96 were incurred.



We recommended and Management, thru the College President, agreed to demand from the contractor the liquidated damages of P498,581.66 which were not deducted from the latter’s claims, otherwise, the same shall be disallowed in audit.  He should also instruct the Accountant to henceforth, thoroughly review all the payments made to contractors to ensure that liquidated damages and retention money are properly deducted therefrom in compliance with R.A. No. 9184 and its R-IRR. 



The above findings as well as other observations were discussed with management in an exit conference conducted on May 25, 2021.  Management comments are incorporated in the report where appropriate.
