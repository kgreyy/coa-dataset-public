PART II – AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)	Financial and Compliance Audit



1. The existence, accuracy and reliability of the reported balances of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts totaling P135,934,707.38 could not be ascertained due to some errors in recording, resulting in a discrepancy of P19,266,594.10 between the accounting records and the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE), contrary to the prescribed policies and procedures in the recording, reporting and maintenance of the PPE accounts under GAM for NGAs, Volume I.



As of year-end the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account has a balance of P135,934,707.38 in the Statement of Financial Position(SPF). Comparison of the balance per books against the Report of Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) submitted by the Agency of P116,668,113.28 disclosed a  discrepancy of P19,266,594.10, as presented in the following table:

Analysis of the account revealed that part of the discrepancies noted above could be attributed to the following:  



a)	Cost of renovations of PCSD Buildings particularly Palawan Sustainable Development Training Institute (PSDTI) Building, and District Management Office Building totaling P8,714,235.83 was recorded as Buildings but not reported in the RPCPPE.



b)	Cost of Environmentally Critical Areas Network (ECAN) Regulation and Enforcement Division (ERED) Museum amounting to P959,763.25 which was reported under the Other Structures account was not included in the RPCPPE.



c)	Office supplies amounting to P2,659,330.57 were recorded in the books as ICT Equipment instead of Office Supplies Inventory, inconsistent with Chapter 3 of GAM, Volume III, which provides the following:



Office Supplies Inventory - This account is used to recognize the cost or value of purchased/acquired office supplies such as bond papers, inks, and small tangible items like staple wire removers, punchers, staplers and other similar items for government operations. Credit this account for issuance to end-users, transfers, loss or other disposal.



Information and Communications Technology Equipment - This account is used to recognize the cost incurred in the purchase of information and communications technology equipment, which includes hardware (computers, printers, scanners, and the like) and pre-loaded software such as but not limited to operating systems which are included in the cost of the computer hardware. This also includes data communications equipment and such other peripherals and auxiliary equipment necessary to put the system into operational mode.



d)	Various motor vehicles amounting to P3,687,829.80 were reported in the books but not included in the RPCPPE. Details are shown below.

e)	Semi-expendable items totaling P1,192,463.00(Annex A) with costs below the capitalization threshold were classified as PPE, contrary to Section 10, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I, which provides that tangible items below the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 shall be accounted as semi-expendable property. This deficiency likewise understates the corresponding inventory account by the same amount.

f)	The demolished District Management Office (DMO) Building amounting to P2,827,591.95 was still in the books and included in the RPCPPE.



g)	Various unserviceable properties totaling P4,228,065.64 (Annex B) were included in the RPCPPE, contrary to Section40 of GAM, Vol. I, which provides that all unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP). PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation).



It was also noted that the Property/Supply Office and the Accounting Office still failed to maintain/update the Property Cards (PCs) and the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Cards (PPELC), respectively, contrary to Section 42, Chapter 10 of GAM, Volume I, which provides that “the Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like PAR”.



The Accountant and Supply Officer confirmed the noted deficiencies and committed to update their records. 



The noted deficiencies and the discrepancy of P19,266,594.10 between the books and the RPCPPE as shown in the above table rendered the balances of the PPE accounts unreliable.

	

	We recommended that the Executive Director instructs:

	

a)		the Accountant to effect the necessary corrections/adjustments on the noted deficiencies to present fairly the value of the PPE accounts in the financial statements and to recognize in the books only those PPE that meet the recognition criteria stated under Section 3, Chapter 10 of GAM; and

	

b)		the Property/Supply Officer and Accountant to maintain and update the PCs and PPELCs on all the PPE accounts and ensure that these are regularly reconciled with the Accounting records. Investigate any discrepancy noted and make necessary adjusting entries, if warranted.

	

	The Management agreed to comply with the audit recommendations.

	

	

2. 	The accuracy and existence of Inventories totaling P3,387,503.32 could not be ascertained due to a) discrepancy of P2,984,841.12 between the accounting records and the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI); b) failure of the Accounting Office to maintain the SLC; and c) failure of the Property/Supply Office to prepare and submit RSMI to the Accounting Office, in violation of the prescribed policies and procedures in the recording, reporting, and maintenance of records of the Inventory accounts under GAM for NGAs.

	

The Statement of Financial Position (SFP) of the Agency as of December 31, 2020 shows various Inventory accounts totalling P3,387,503.32. Verification of the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) revealed a total balance of only P402,662.20 as of year-end or a discrepancy of P2,984,841.12 between the balance per books and the RPCI. A comparison of the Inventory balances between the accounting records and the RPCI is shown below.

The Accountant stated that the Inventory balances represent the costs of the remaining items of supplies and materials purchased in prior years with no corresponding issuances recognized in the books due to the failure of the Property/Supply Office to prepare and submit the RSMI to the Accounting Division/Unit, contrary to Section 17, Chapter 8 of GAM, Volume I, which provides that Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) shall be prepared by the Property and/or Supply Custodian based on the Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) and shall be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the JEV to record the supplies and materials issued.



The Audit Team also noted that Office Supplies amounting to P2,364,651.54 were directly recorded under Office Supplies Expense account instead of Office Supplies Inventory, inconsistent with Section 3 of GAM, Volume III, which provides that Office Supplies Inventory account is used to recognize the cost or value of purchased/acquired office supplies such as bond papers, inks, and small tangible items like staple wire removers, punchers, staplers and other similar items for government operations. Credit this account for issuance to end-users, transfers, loss or other disposal.



Moreover, the Accounting Office failed to maintain the Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) contrary to Section 17, Chapter 8 of GAM, Volume I, which provides that Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) (Appendix 57) shall be used to record materials received, issued, and the balance both in quantity and amount at any time. It shall be maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit for each kind of supplies and materials. The IAR, RIS, Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI), PO and DR serve as the original sources of information for making entries on the card.



The noted discrepancy of P2,984,841.12 between the recorded balance of Inventory Account by the Accounting Unit and the Property Office; and the failure of the Accounting Office to maintain the SLC and the Property/Supply Office to prepare and submit RSMIs to the Accounting Office, rendered the existence, accuracy, and completeness of the reported balances of the Inventory accounts doubtful.



We recommended that the Executive Director require:



a. 	the Accountant to (i) maintain SLCs and reconcile them with the RPCI; (ii)make necessary adjustments on any discrepancies noted; and (iii) ensure proper classification of accounts in accordance with  Section 3 of GAM, Volume III; and



b. the Property/Supply Officer to regularly submit RSMIs to the Accounting Office as basis in recording issued supplies and materials.



	The Management agreed to comply with the audit recommendations.



3.	Overpayment of Terminal Leave Benefits to eight employees totaling P411,655.44 due to errors in the mathematical computation of accumulated leave credits and failure to deduct the mandatory annual five days’ vacation leave prescribed under Section 25 (d) of Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 4.



Rule XVI of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order (EO) No. 292, as amended by CSC MC Nos. 41, series 1998, 6 and 14, series 1999, provides the guidelines on terminal leave. Also, the computation for terminal leave benefits isprovided under Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Budget Circular No. 2016-2 dated March 29, 2016, as follows:



		TLB = S x D x CF

	

		Where:

	

		TLB = Terminal Leave Benefits

		S = Highest monthly salary received

		D = No. of accumulated vacation and sick leave credits

		CF = constant factor which is .0481927

	

	Post-audit of the disbursement vouchers (DV) on the payment of terminal leave benefits to eight  retired/resigned employees totaling P3,311,134.11 in Calendar Year (CY) 2020 revealed that the attached leave cards were not complete contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445.  Missing leave cards cover the period of three to 26 years. When the Audit Team requested the HRMO to submit the missing leave cards, the assigned personnel declared that those were the only available records/data in the office that were transferred to him/her by the former staff assigned.  The HRMO also stated that the beginning balances of the leave cards were based on the recovered ledgers which were among the documents turned over by the former staff.

	

Review of the available/submitted leave cards of the retired/resigned employees disclosed that the balances of the vacation and sick leave were inaccurate due to errors in the mathematical computation of leave credit balances.  The HRMO also failed to deduct the annual five days forced leave of those with at least 10 days’ vacation leave balance contrary to Section 25 (d) of CSC MC No. 41, series 1998, whichprovides that:



All officials and employees with 10 days or more vacation leave credits shall be required to go on vacation leave whether continuous or intermittent for a minimum of five (5) working days annually under the following conditions: (d) Those with accumulated vacation leave of less than ten (10) days shall have the option to go on forced leave or not. However, officials and employees with accumulated vacation leave of 15 days who availed of monetization for 10 days, under Section 22 hereof, shall still be required to go on forced leave.



A re-computation of the accumulated leave credits of retired/resigned employees based on available leave cards showed that there were overpayments of terminal leave benefits totaling P411,655.44, as shown below.

	We recommended that Management:

	

	a. cause the refund of the excess payment of terminal leave benefits from the retired personnel;

	

	b. instruct the HRMO to exert efforts to locate the missing leave cards to facilitate the recomputation of vacation and sick leave balances of each personnel from start of employment up to the last date of service; and 

	

	c. henceforth, ensure the correctness of computation of vacation and sick leave balances before payment of terminal leave benefits.

	

	The Management agreed to comply with the audit recommendations and informed that they already started looking for the missing leave credits.

4.  Disbursements for repairs and maintenance of motor vehicles totaling P2,356,693.10 were not completely supported with the required documents prescribed under Section 9.1.3.4 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, contrary to Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 thus, casting doubt on the validity and propriety of the transactions.

	

Section 4 (6) of P.D. No. 1445 otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines which states that claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.



Sec. 9.1.3.4 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribed the documentary requirements for the repair and maintenance of aircraft, equipment, and motor vehicles, as follows:



--	Additional documents under Annexes Q and R of COA Memorandum No. 2005-027 dated February 28, 2005 required to be submitted to the Auditor’s Office within five days from the execution of the contract:

--	Copy of the pre-repair evaluation report and approved detailed plans by the agency showing un sufficient detail the scope of work/extent of repair to be done

--	Report of waste materials

--	Copy of document indicating the history of repair



--	Post-inspection reports

--	Warranty Certificate

--	Request for payment

--	Bill/Invoices

--	Certificate of Acceptance

--	Pre-repair inspection reports

--	Such other documents peculiar to the contract and/or to the mode of procurement and considered necessary in the auditorial review and in technical evaluation thereof

Likewise, COA Circular No. 81-131A dated January 29, 1981 provides that a record of repairs of vehicles, and other equipment be kept by the agency, indicating therein the type of repair undertaken, the date when it was made, and other pertinent data for the information and guidance of the COA, the agency and others concerned.



Post-audit revealed that disbursements for repairs and maintenance of motor vehicles totaling P2,356,693.10 in CY 2020 were not supported with post-inspection reports, warranty certificates, pre-repair inspection reports, and maintenance/repairs history records indicating the date, cost, and nature of repairs done on each motor vehicle.



In the absence of the required documents, detailed review and verification of the transactions cannot be undertaken by the Audit Team thus, casting doubt on the validity and propriety of the expenses.

	

	We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to ensure that disbursements are supported with complete and proper documents pursuant to existing rules and regulations and to maintain a record of maintenance/repair of each government equipment indicating the date, nature of the repair undertaken, and other pertinent data as required under COA Circular No. 81-131A.

	

	The Management agreed to comply with the audit recommendations.

	

5.	Lapses in the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances were noted in audit, such as a) incomplete supporting documents; b) not used solely for its intended purpose; and c) additional cash advances were granted despite non-liquidation of the previous cash advancescontrary to COA Circular Nos. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 and 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. Likewise, cash advances were reported/recorded in the books as fully liquidated despite non-refund of the excess/unutilized amount resulting in the understatement of the reported balance of the Advances to SDO account by P355,293.57.



COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides the pertinent rules and regulations regarding the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances (CAs), as follows:



--	No Cash advance shall be given unless for a legally specific purpose.

--	No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.

--	A cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served.

--	The cash advance shall be used solely for the specific legal purpose for which it was granted. Under no circumstance shall it be used for encashment of checks or for liquidation of a previous cash advance.



Likewise, Section 1.2.2, 1.2.3 and 5.7.4 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribed the revised guidelines and documentary requirements for common government transactions, as follows: 



1.2.2 Petty Cash Fund



--	Summary of Petty Cash Vouchers

	--	Report of Disbursements

	--	Petty Cash Replenishment Report

	--	Approved purchase request with certificate of Emergency Purchase, if necessary

	--	Bills, receipts, sales invoices

	--	Certificate of inspection and acceptance

	--	Report of Waste Materials in case of replacement/repair

	--	Approved trip ticket, for gasoline expenses

	--	Canvass from at least three suppliers for purchases involving P1,000 and above, except for purchases made while on official travel

	--	Summary/Abstract of Canvass

	--	Petty Cash Vouchers duly accomplished and signed

	--	OR in case of refund

	--	For reimbursement of toll receipts

		--	Toll Receipts

		--	Trip Tickets

	--	Such other supporting documents that may be required and/or required under the company policy depending on the nature of expenses



1.2.3 Field/Activity Current Operating Expenses



--	Same requirements as those for salaries, petty operating expenses, other personal services, and maintenance and other operating expenses depending on the nature of expenses incurred



5.7.4 Lecturer/Coordinator



--	Office Order

--	Coordinator’s report on lecturer’s schedule

--	Course Syllabus/Program of Lectures

--	Duly approved DTR in case of claims by the coordinator and facilitators

Review of the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances by the Agency, revealed the following deficiencies:



a)	Liquidation of cash advances for field/activity operating expenses, specifically for payments of catering services, rental, meals and office supplies, and payment of honoraria of resource persons and coordinators, lacked the canvass from at least three suppliers and summary/abstract of canvass and coordinator’s report on lecturer’s schedule, course syllabus/program of lectures and duly approved DTR of the coordinator and facilitators, as required pursuant to Sections 1.2 and 5.7.4 of COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012.



b)	Cash advance amounting to P225,572.00 for field/activity operating expenses was used in paying the salary of two contractual employees amounting to P54,583.13 and reimbursements of travel expenses of employees amounting to P34,900.00, contrary to Section 4.1.7 of COA Circular No. 97-002.



c)	Additional cash advances were granted to a Special Disbursing Officer (SDO) despite non-liquidation of previous cash advances contrary to the above mentioned provision. Details of the cash advances granted to the said SDO in CY 2020 are shown below.

Total Advances to Special Disbursing Officer, December 31, 2020

P355,293.57

The unliquidated balance of P355,293.57 was refunded only in January and March 2021 but the Advances to SDO account as reflected in the SFP as of December 31, 2020 was already zero.  Hence, the reported balance of Advances to SDO account in the financial statement as of December 31, 2020 was understated by the said amount and at the same time overstated the corresponding asset and/or expense accounts debited upon recording in full the liquidation of the cash advances. 



We recommended that Management enforce strict compliance with the rules and regulations on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances and ensure that liquidations of cash advances are supported with complete and proper documents required by regulations. 



We also recommended that the Accountant ensure that only the amount liquidated and refunded are recorded in the books.



The Management confirmed the noted observations and informed that Intra-Office Memorandum (IOM) No. 39 dated March 15, 2021 was already issued to address the noted lapses in the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances.  The management also committed to conduct an extensive evaluation on the proper handling of cash advances.



6.	Delayed/non-submission of monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements, in violation of Sections 5 and 7, Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual, Volume I, deprived the Agency of the benefit of prompt review and correction of error, if any.



Chapter 21 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, provides the guidelines on the preparation and submission of the Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS), as follows: 



Sec. 4 - The monthly BRS shall be prepared by the Chief Accountant/designated staff for each of the bank accounts maintained by the agency/entity using the Adjusted Balance Method. Under this method, the book balance and the bank balance are brought to an adjusted cash balance that must appear on the Statement of Financial Position.



Sec. 5 - The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the Government Servicing Bank (GSB), reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the BRS in four copies.



Sec. 7 - The Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS within twenty days after receipt of the monthly BS to the following:



Original – COA Auditor (with all the supporting documents and JEVs)

Copy 2 – Head of Agency/Entity

Copy 3 – Accounting Division/Unit file

Copy 4 – Bank, if necessary



Records show that the Accountant failed to submit the monthly BRS for two bank accounts in CY2020 while the BRS for the months of January to November 2020 of the other two bank accounts of the Agency were submitted only on February 22, 2021 and the BRS for the month of December 2020 was submitted on March 5, 2021, as shown below

Interviews revealed that the delayed preparation and submission of the BRSs was due to late transmittal of the Monthly Bank Statements and scanned copy of the returned checks by the bank.



The failure of the Accountant to submit Monthly BRS is contrary to  Sections 5 and 7, Chapter 21 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.



We recommended that the Executive Director instruct the Accountant to ensure the timely preparation and submission of BRS so that errors/omissions and/or reconciling items, if any, would be immediately detected for correction and adjustment in the books of accounts through (i) consistent follow-up with the bank of the transmittal of BS;and/or (ii) enrollment on an on-line banking services.



The Management commented that the PCSD Staff DBP Account for Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR account)was alreadyclosedand that efforts had already been exerted to obtain the bank statements for the Payroll account. Upon receipt of the bank statements, the required BRS for the payroll account will be submitted.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



As per Bank Certification dated January 25, 2021, the JFPR account was closed only on November 15, 2020, hence the required BRS for January to November 15, 2020should still be prepared and submitted.

	

7.	The management failed to submit a copy of the CY 2020 Approved Gender and Development (GAD) Plan and Budget and its corresponding Actual Accomplishment Report tothe COA Team contrary to COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014.



Section 31 of General Provisions of General Appropriations Act of FY 2020 provides that all agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under R.A.  No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2005), and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).



The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets.  For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.



The preparation and submission of annual GAD Plan and Budget and Accomplishment Report shall be guided by Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01 issued by DBM, NEDA and PCW. 



Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 states that:



Responsibility of the Audited Agency: The Audited Agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the COA Team assigned to the agency within five (5) working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the PCW or their mother or central offices as the case maybe.  Likewise, a copy of the corresponding accomplishment report shall be furnished the Audit team within five (5) working days from the end of January of the preceding year.



  Records show that the Agency failed to submit to the Audit Team a copy of its duly approved GPB and the Accomplishment Report for CY 2020, in violation of the provision of the said COA Circular No. 2014-001.  



The non-submission of the GPB and corresponding Accomplishment Report for CY 2020 prevented the timely review and evaluation of the disbursements and activities under the GAD program. 



We recommended that Management submit the duly Approved GAD Plan and Budget and Accomplishment Report for CY 2020 as well as the explanation or reason/s on non-submission thereof.  Henceforth, submit the required reports to COA within the prescribed period under Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 to facilitate the timely evaluation of the implementation of GAD related programs/projects and substantive audit of the GAD related transactions.



The Management commented that according to the GAD Focal Person, as of March 19, 2021, the PCSDS has not received the approved GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) from the PCW.



The GAD agenda and the corresponding CY 2020 GPB were submitted to the PCW in 2019, pursuant to the PCW–NEDA–DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01. However, the PCW only informed the PCSDS of the former’s initial comments on the said GPB on March 2021.



It was likewise assured to submit the FY 2020 GAD Accomplishment Report following the existing PCW Guidelines as supplemented by Memorandum Circular No. 2021-03 dated March 15, 2021. However, according to Management, they are constrained to wait for the approval/endorsement from PCW before submitting to the Audit Team the GPB for CY 2020.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



The Agency should have carried out queries with the PCW on the status of the GAD Budget and Plan to ensure timely submission as required. We reiterate strict adherence to the pertinent rules and regulations on the submission of approved GAD Plan and Budget and Accomplishment Report.
