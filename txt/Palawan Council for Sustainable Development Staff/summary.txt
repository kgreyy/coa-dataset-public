Scope of Audit



	The Audit Team conducted Financial and Compliance Audit on the accounts and operations of the PCSDS for CY2020.  It included analysis of accounts in the financial statements, review of transactions and test of compliance with financial rules and regulations and evaluation of the policies, processes and internal control. The objectives of the audit areto ascertain the fairness and reliability of the Agency’s financial position and financial performance, to determine whether its operations were conducted in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and to assess the level of internal control on the policies and processes of the Agency.





Audit Opinion on the Financial Statements



	The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial statementsof the Agency as the existence, accuracy and reliability of the reported balances of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts totaling P135,934,707.38 could not be ascertained due to some errors in recording, which resulted in a discrepancy of P19,266,594.10 between the accounting records and the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE), contrary to the prescribed policies and procedures in the recording, reporting and maintenance of the PPE accounts under GAM for NGAs, Volume I.

	

	

	Significant Observations and Recommendations

	

For the exception cited above, we recommended that the Executive Director instruct:



a)		the Accountant to effect the necessary corrections/adjustments on the noted deficiencies to present fairly the value of the PPE accounts in the financial statements and to recognize in the books only those PPE that meet the recognition criteria stated under Section 3. Chapter 10 of GAM; and

	

b)		the Property/Supply Officer and Accountant to maintain and update the PCs and PPELCs on all the PPE accounts and ensure that these are regularly reconciled with the Accounting records. Investigate any discrepancy noted and make necessary adjusting entries, if warranted.

	

In addition, the following are the other significant audit observations and recommendations in the audit of the Agency for the year 2020:



1)	The accuracy and existence of Inventories totaling P3,387,503.32 could not be ascertained due to a) discrepancy of P2,984,841.12 between the accounting records and the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI); b)failure of the Accounting Office to maintain the SLC; and c) failure of the Property/Supply Office to prepare and submit RSMI to the Accounting Office, in violation of the prescribed policies and procedures in the recording, reporting, and maintenance of records of the Inventory accounts under GAM for NGAs.



We recommended that the Executive Director require a) the Accountant to maintain SLCs and reconcile them with the RPCI; (ii) make necessary adjustments on any discrepancies noted; and (iii) ensure proper classification of accounts in accordance with Section 3 of GAM, Volume III; and b) the Property/Supply Officer to regularly submit RSMIs to the Accounting Office as basis in recording issued supplies and materials.



2)	Overpayment of Terminal Leave Benefits to eight employees totaling P411,655.44 due to errors in the mathematical computation of accumulated leave credits and failure to deduct the mandatory annual five days’ vacation leave prescribed under Section 25 (d) of Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 4.



We recommended that the Executive Director a) cause the refund of the excess payment of terminal leave benefits from the retired personnel; b) instruct the HRMO to exert efforts to locate the missing leave cards to facilitate the recomputation of vacation and sick leave balances of each personnel from start of employment up to the last date of service; and c) henceforth, ensure the correctness of computation of vacation and sick leave balances before payment of terminal leave benefits.



3)	Disbursements for repairs and maintenance of motor vehicles totaling P2,356,693.10 were not completely supported with the required documents prescribed under Section 9.1.3.4 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, contrary to Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 thus, casting doubt on the validity and propriety of the transactions.



	We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to ensure that disbursements are supported with complete and proper documents pursuant to existing rules and regulations and to maintain a record of maintenance/repair of each government equipment indicating the date, nature of the repair undertaken, and other pertinent data as required under COA Circular No. 81-131A.

	

4)	Lapses in the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances were noted in audit, such as a) incomplete supporting documents; b) not used solely for its intended purpose; and c) additional cash advances were granted despite non-liquidation of the previous cash advances contrary to COA Circular Nos. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 and 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. Likewise, cash advances were reported/recorded in the books as fully liquidated despite non-refund of the excess/unutilized amount resulting in the understatement of the reported balance of the Advances to SDO account by P355,293.57.



We recommended that Management enforce strict compliance with the rules and regulations on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances and ensure that liquidations of cash advances are supported with complete and proper documents required by regulations. We also recommended that the Accountant ensure that only the amount liquidated and refunded are recorded in the books.
