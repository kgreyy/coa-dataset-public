OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Financial and Compliance Audit 
 

Internal control deficiencies 

 

1. The adjustments and corrections of errors/omissions noted in review of the 
financial statements could have been avoided had there been proper evaluation 

of relevant transactions, and coordination of the Accounting Division and 

appropriate offices before recording in the books of accounts was undertaken. 

If not properly addressed, the noted lapses may affect the agency’s internal 

control system relative to the accuracy and reliability of its accounting data.  

 

In fulfilling its mission and mandates, an agency must achieve as well the 

separate but interrelated general objectives of internal control, namely to:                       

a. Safeguard assets; b. Check the accuracy and reliability of accounting data;                

c. Adhere to managerial policies; d. Comply with laws and regulations; and e. Ensure 

effective, efficient, ethical, and economical operations.  

 

Whereas, Section 15, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of the GAM requires that the FSs 

present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an 

entity.  Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of 

transactions, other events and conditions, in accordance with the definitions and 

recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses set out in the 

applicable public sector accounting standards.  

 

Post-audit of accounts and review of FSs as at December 31, 2020 submitted by 

Management on February 16, 2021 revealed accounting errors/omissions and erroneous 

presentation of FSs such as erroneous accounting entries, unrecorded and misclassified 

transactions as well as the erroneous presentation of prior period adjustments in the FSs.   

Management informed that they consider the budget source in the recording of transactions 

that the prescribed accounts under Volume III of the GAM were not used.  

 

Also, deficiencies were noted in the financial reports submitted by other responsible 

office to the Accounting Division, particularly on the Medical Assistance Program of the OVP.   

 

The deficiencies identified in the course of audit were communicated to 

Management in an Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM). Management 

immediately complied with the audit recommendations to take up the unrecorded 

liquidations, correct/adjust the noted accounting errors and revise the submitted FSs. 

The noted lapses impact on the agency’s internal control system weakness relative to 

the accuracy and reliability of its accounting data. 

 

The noted conditions could have been avoided if the Accounting Division 

carefully analyzed/reviewed the transactions and financial reports before recording 



35 

 

in the books, and had there been proper coordination between the Accounting 

Division and other responsible offices of the OVP.    

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. instruct the Accountant to exercise diligence in the review of 
transactions before recording in the books ensuring that the same 

are recorded to the proper accounts prescribed in Volume III of the 

GAM in order to present a more reliable financial information;   

 

b. advise the Budget Officer to consider the purpose of the goods to be 
procured by the OVP, and include the same in the appropriate 

budget line item in the proposed annual budget of the agency; 

 

c. direct the Accounting Division and Property Unit to regularly 
reconcile their records to ensure that inventory items at year-end are 

recorded in the appropriate account; and 

  

d. require the Accounting Division and PAD to periodically reconcile 
their records to ensure the correctness of the reported medical 

assistance; and closely monitor the status of transferred funds.  

 

 

Purchase of Equipment out of MOOE Budget 

 

2. Procurement of medical equipment donated to a government hospital 
amounting to ₱3,531,200.00, considered as capital expenditures, was improperly 

charged to allotment for MOOE, inconsistent with Section 17 of the GP of the 

GAA for FY 2020 (RA No. 11465). 

 

The GP of the GAA, FY 2020, states, among others, the following:  

 

Section 17. Use of Government Funds.  Government funds shall be 

utilized in accordance with the appropriations authorized for the 

purpose and comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations. 

 

 

Sec. 70.  Rules on Modification in the Allotment. As a general rule, 

departments, bureaus, and offices of the National Government, 

including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and 

SUCs shall spend what is programmed in their respective 

appropriations in this Act. In exceptional circumstances, agencies 

may modify the allotment issued within an activity or project subject 

to approval of the following ensued by the timely submission of 

reports by all offices concerned: 

 



36 

 

xxx 

 

(b) The DBM, in the following modifications: (i) from one 

allotment class to another; (ii) from one operating unit to 

another; (iii) within a special purpose fund; and (iv) for the 

payment of magna carta benefits authorized under Section 50 

hereof; and  

 

xxx 

 

As defined in the Glossary of Terms of the DBM, MOOE refers to an 

expenditure category/expense class for support to the operations of government 

agencies such as expenses for supplies and materials; transportation and travel; 

utilities (water, power, etc) and the repairs, etc. While Capital Outlays/Expenditures 

refers to an expenditure category/expenses class for the purchase of goods and 

services, the benefits of which extend beyond the fiscal year and which add to the 

assets of Government, including investments in the capital stock of GOCCs and their 

subsidiaries.  

 

Post-audit of transactions disclosed that OVP procured medical equipment 

totaling ₱3,531,200.00 which were donated to a government hospital, with details as 

follows: 

 

Particulars 
Amount (₱) 

Unit Cost Total Cost 

10 units of Powered Air Purifying Respirator 29,120.00 291,200.00 

3 units of CL2000V3 Ventilator 1,080,000.00 3,240,000.00 

Total  3,531,200.00 

 

However, the said procurements were improperly charged against the OVP’s 

appropriated MOOE budget for its assistance/subsidy program. The procurement of 

medical equipment is considered capital expenditures, hence, should have been 

charged to Capital Outlay allotment.     

 

As per Management, the transaction was charged under the Subsidies-Others 

budget of the OVP since the intention of the purchase is to provide an assistance to a 

government hospital in the fight against COVID-19. Unaware of the need to request 

for modification due to the understanding of the nature of OVP’s Subsidies-Others 

budget, the transaction pushed through. 

 

OVP should have considered the availability of the appropriate fund/allotment 

before it undertook the subject procurement.  Since the law allows the modification 

in allotment, OVP should have requested, instead, from DBM for the modification of 

its MOOE budget for assistance/subsidy program to Capital Outlay to finance the 

donated medical equipment.  

 

 



37 

 

We recommended that Management henceforth, ensure that the agency’s 

funds are utilized in accordance with the appropriations authorized for the 

purpose.  

 

Management Comments: 

 

Management submits that the donated medical equipment to government 

hospital was properly charged under the MOOE, particularly under the Subsidies-

Others account. Hence, there is no need to obtain an approval from the DBM. 

 

Section 3, Chapter 10, Volume 1 of the GAM provides that the cost of an item 

of PPE shall be recognized if, and only if: 

 

a) It is probable that the future economic benefit or service potential 
associated with the item will flow to the entity; 

b) The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably; 
c) Beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the government; 
d) The asset is used to achieve government objectives; and 
e) It meets the capitalization threshold of ₱5,000.00 

 

Similarly, the International Accounting Standard (IAS) 16.7 provides that 

Fixed Assets or PPE should be recognized based on the following factors: 

 

a) The cost of items of PPE should be recognized as an asset if and only if it 
is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the item will 

flow to the entity; and 

b) Cost of the item can be measured reliably. 
 

For this particular transaction, the procured equipment will not inure to the 

benefit of the OVP. The clear intention of the Office when it acquired the equipment 

was to donate it to the government hospital, hence, it cannot be considered a 

capitalizable asset but as an outright expense. In fact, the equipment that was 

procured was directly delivered to the hospital who shall have beneficial ownership 

and control over the same. 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

It should be emphasized that the issue is not the recording of the procured 

medical equipment in the OVP’s books of accounts but the improper use of MOOE 

budget considering that said procurement is considered capital expenditures 

regardless of whether the same was intended for donation purposes.

Delayed Submission of Financial Reports and Supporting Documents 

 

3. Financial Reports and supporting documents for CY 2020 were not submitted 
to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed period, contrary to the rules 

and regulations on submission of reports; hence, their timely evaluation, and 

consequently the early detection and immediate communication to management 

of deficiencies, if any, were not done, including the corresponding corrective 

actions to be undertaken. 

 

One of the standards to achieve fair presentation and reliable information of 

the financial statements is timeliness in the preparation and submission of reports. 

All needed reports together with its attachments and supporting documents should 

be produced promptly to be of maximum usefulness. 

 

Section 107 of PD No. 1445, requires, among others that all accountable 

officers render their accounts and submit their disbursement vouchers, at such times 

and in such manner as shall be prescribed in the regulations of the COA.  

 

Section 7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 states that the Chief Accountant, 

Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing and/or bookkeeping functions of 

the audited agency shall ensure that the reports and supporting documents submitted 

by the accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and 

submitted to the Auditor within the first 10 days of the ensuing month. 

 

Likewise, Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM, provides that 

deadline for submission of monthly trial balance and supporting schedules is 10 days 

after the end of the month, while for yearend trial balance and supporting schedules 

is on or before February 14 of the following year. 

 

Records showed that the Accounting Division failed to submit on time the 

following financial reports and supporting documents, with delays ranging from 22 

to 74 days. The details are shown below:

It can be gleaned from the above table that the Accounting Division were 

unable to comply with the submission of reports and supporting documents as 

required.  Per inquiry, the delays were caused by difficulty to complete attachments 

and supporting documents of the transactions due to the current situation of pandemic 

and voluminous monthly transactions of the Agency. 

 

The Audit Team acknowledged the difficulty of meeting deadlines due to 

abnormal times; however, we would like to remind the concerned officers that 

financial reports and supporting documents are still to be submitted despite the 

pandemic, therefore, the concerned officers should keep track of their 

responsibilities. 

 

Non-compliance with the required deadlines in the submission of financial 

reports and supporting documents precluded the timely verification of the accounts 

and transactions by the Audit Team, corrections of deficiencies, if any, as well as 

communication of results to Management.  

 

We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to monitor the 

submission of documents in order to keep pace with the deadlines per Section 

7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2019-006, and Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I of 

the GAM. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

Management in their reply explained that the delays were mainly caused by 

the adjustments made in the processing and approval system in as much as the Office 

has been operating under alternative work arrangement from the start of the 

declaration of the State of Health Emergency. In line with this, specific measures 

were made to facilitate online approval of the transactions to ensure continuity of the 

operations notwithstanding the limitations on the current setup. Due to this, 

Management had to double check and re-route documents to further ensure that those 



40 

 

which were approved through online arrangements bear the required wet signatures 

of the approving officials. Further, there is a surge of transactions during the period 

in view of the OVP’s COVID-19 initiatives. 

 

In view of the foregoing, Management respectfully appeal for utmost 

consideration as OVP had to adjust to the current situation to ensure everyone’s safety 

amidst the pandemic.  

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

Again, we acknowledged the difficulty faced by Management during this 

abnormal times as it has to dedicate majority of its staff to its COVID-19 Operations. 

We believe with OVP’s capacity to easily adjust with our current work set-up and 

still effectively discharge their duties and function; henceforth, we expect for 

improvement in the timely submission of reports from Management.  

 

 

Process Gaps in the Reporting of Donations Received and Distributed 

 

4. Process gaps were noted in the handling and monitoring of the receipt and 
distribution of donations in-kind, particularly with regard to some incomplete 

and varying information in the Summary/List of Donations Received, 

Distribution and Balances, and distribution list.  Moreover, submission of the 

quarterly report ending December 31, 2020 to the Office of Civil Defense and 

COA was delayed by 34 days contrary to Item II.1 of COA Circular No. 2020-

009 dated April 21, 2020.  

 

Item II.1 of COA Circular No. 2020-009 dated April 21, 2020 requires 

government agencies to submit a Summary/List of Donations Received, Distributed 

and Balances to the Office of Civil Defense during the period of quarantine for in-

kind donations received from local and foreign sources, to wit: 

 

To ensure that the aids and donations received by the recipient 

agencies during the quarantine are properly accounted for, the 

recipient agencies shall be required to submit a Summary/List of 

Donations Received, Distributed and Balances. The Summary/List 

should be categorized (i.e. food, medical supplies, medicines, etc...) 

and can be submitted within ten (10) working days after the end of 

the quarantine, or if the quarantine exceeds three (3) months, within 

ten (10) working days after the end of each quarter, supported with:  

(1) acknowledgement receipts of the donations in-kind;  

(2) proof of receipt by and distribution to the beneficiaries, not 

necessarily in the required form; and  

(3) inventory of remaining undistributed items, if any. 

 

xxx 



41 

 

 

In lieu of the monthly report, the concerned agencies shall submit a 

one-time report, separately for cash donations and in-kind 

donations, within ten (10) working days after the end of the 

quarantine to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and 

Management Council (NDRRMC), through the Office of the Civil 

Defense (OCD), copy furnished the respective COA Auditors. 

However, if the quarantine exceeds three (3) months, the report shall 

be submitted within ten (10) working days after the end of each 

quarter. 

 

During the period of COVID-19 and calamities due to Typhoons, OVP 

received in-kind donations from various donors in CY 2020. 

 

Verification of the submitted Summary/List of Donations Received, 

Distributed and Balances as of December 31, 2020 against the distribution list, which 

was limited to only few selected items due to volume of donations reported and the 

difficulty of verifying the report, revealed the following observations:  

 

a. Lack of item description, unit, quantity and cost of several items; 
b. Inclusion in the relief packs was not itemized; and 
c. Variances between the summary/list of donations and distribution list 

 

Also, there were deficiencies, such as remaining undistributed items declared 

as distributed, earlier noted in the September 30, 2020 report which were 

communicated to Management through an Audit Query, and caused the Management 

to adjust the said report, however, no additional information as to the subsequent 

disposition of the remaining undistributed items or where they were stored/kept was 

provided by Management, thus, proper verification thereof was not facilitated. 

 

Moreover, submission of summary/list for the quarter ending of December 31, 

2020 to OCD and COA was done only on March 8, 2021, or delayed by 34 working 

days contrary to the above cited provision of COA Circular No. 2020-009 dated April 

21, 2020.  

 

Subject to the submission of additional information, verification as to whether 

all donations received by the OVP were fully and properly accounted for could not 

be established. 

  

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. investigate the deficiencies noted in the December 31, 2020 report and 
submit a revised/adjusted report duly supported with 

acknowledgement receipt for the donations received and distribution 

list duly received by the beneficiaries/recipients; 

 



42 

 

b. submit information on the status of undistributed items; 
 

c. strengthen controls on the handling, monitoring and reporting of 
donations by institutionalizing systematic processes of accepting, 

recording and distribution of donations received to ensure that 

donations are fully and properly accounted for; 

 

d. review and prepare diligently the report before submission to 
concerned agencies; and 

 

e. submit the succeeding Summary/List of Donations Received, 
Distributed and Balances to OCD and COA within the period 

prescribed under COA Circular No. 2020-009. 

 

Management Comments: 

 

Management explained that the OCD has granted their request to extend the 

deadline of submission of the 1st Quarter 2021 report to June 15, 2021. The surge in 

COVID-19 cases in NCR Plus and emergence of variants, which resulted in the 

reimposition of ECQ effective March 29, 2021, pushed them to intensify their 

COVID-19 operations and admittedly took up the time of their staff. 

 

Upon further checking, the discrepancies found were mostly due to the 

difference in the unit of measure of the summary/list of donations and the distribution 

report. The other deficiencies noted are in view of the following: 

 

a. There were assorted donations in-kind under the drop off arrangement 
without details, pre-packed hygiene kits and relief packs with varying 

contents. These items were not repacked but distributed on “as is” basis 

and were recorded under the relief goods and hygiene kits.  

b. The item composition per pack (relief goods and hygiene kits) could not 
be standardized inasmuch as only the available items at the time of actual 

repacking can be included in the package. 

c. There were items that are inadvertently included in the distribution list 
which were directly delivered by the donor to the identified communities, 

hence, not included in the summary/list of donations received. 

 

Management committed to submit an updated distribution list while other 

adjustments will be reflected in the 1st quarter 2021 report. Moreover, Management 

will adopt measures to facilitate easier cross referencing between summary/list of 

donations received and distribution list, augment staffing and clarify roles and 

responsibilities to further streamline the process of receiving, issuance, inventory and 

reporting. 

 

Lastly, Management assured that the donations received will be accounted for 

and distributed to its intended beneficiaries.   



43 

 

 

Audit Team’s Rejoinder: 

 

We stress the importance of indicating the inclusion of relief goods and 

hygiene kits (excluding those that were already pre-packed) in our audit. Failure to 

indicate the inclusion of packed relief goods and hygiene kits will make the audit not 

viable since we cannot verify whether all reported donations were all accounted for 

and distributed. Henceforth, we further recommend that Management indicate in the 

distribution list the inclusion of each relief goods and hygiene kits (excluding those 

that were already pre-packed).  

 

On the assorted donations in-kind under the drop off arrangement without 

details, we believe that though these items were without any details, OVP can classify 

these items as canned goods, rice, noodles, biscuits, clothes, etc., if they desired to. 

In this manner, we can facilitate the cross referencing of donations received against 

the distribution list. While those donations directly delivered by the donors to 

beneficiaries should be excluded in the submitted distribution list. 

 

We acknowledged the difficulty experienced by OVP due to voluminous in-

kind donations received during the period of quarantine when the accuracy of the 

reports needs to be established as well.

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

6. OVP had implemented 12 GAD activities and attributed its Medical Assistance 
Program to GAD utilizing ₱69,299,535.88 or 10.68 percent of its total 

appropriation for the year in compliance with Section 31 of the GP of the GAA 

for FY 2020 (RA No. 11465). However, the FY 2020 GPB of the OVP was not 

endorsed by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) due to failure to 

submit the revised GPB within the prescribed deadline, contrary to Section 

1.2.4.1 of PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2019-02 dated August 1, 2019 and 

thus, was not submitted to the Audit Team. 

 

Section 31 of the GP of the GAA for FY 2020 (RA No. 11465) requires all 

agencies of the government to formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender 

issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement applicable 

provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the 

Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform 

for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025), 

and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022).  

 

Moreover, the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 

agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budget.  For this purpose, 

activities currently being undertaken by the agencies which relate to GAD or those 

that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of 

marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human 

rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient 

compliance with said requirements.  Utilization of the GAD budget shall be 

evaluated based on GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies. 



45 

 

 

In line with the current situation of a pandemic, Item 4.3 of PCW 

Memorandum Circular No. 2020-03 states that the computation of the minimum five 

percent (5%) GAD budget as provided under Section 36(a) of the MCW shall be 

based on the total adjusted budget of the agency following National Budget Circular 

No. 580. 

 

Evaluation of the GAD accomplishments for CY 2020 showed that the OVP 

had implemented 12 GAD activities and attributed its Medical Assistance Program 

to GAD utilizing ₱69,299,535.88 or 10.68 percent of OVP’s budget of 

₱649,171,886.00 for the year, as follows:

OVP included in their submitted GAD Accomplishment Report those 

activities conducted during the time of COVID-19 in line with PCW Memorandum 

Circular 2020-03 which allows all national government agencies and 

instrumentalities to review and revise, as necessary, their FY 2020 GPB to 

implement measures to address gender issues and concerns arising from the unequal 

status of their women and men stakeholders due to the COVID-19 situation. 

 

On the other hand, the following Sections of PCW Memorandum Circular No. 

2019-02 prescribes the responsibility of the agency to submit the agency GPB to 

PCW for review and endorsement, to wit: 

 

1.2.2.1 All line departments, constitutional bodies, judicial and 

legislative bodies, attached agencies/bureaus, other 

executive offices (OEOs), and government-owned and/or –

controlled corporations (GOCCs) shall prepare and submit 

their agency-consolidated GPB directly to PCW, for review 

and endorsement.

1.2.4.1  PCW shall endorse the FY 2020 GPB if the agency complies 

with all the requested revisions (if any) in the GPB within 

the prescribed deadline. 

 

On March 12, 2021, Management informed the Audit Team that OVP 

submitted the FY 2020 GPB to PCW on October 18, 2019, for review and 

endorsement but was returned to OVP on November 14, 2019 for revision. Upon an 

attempt to submit the revised GPB, OVP was notified that PCW will no longer 

endorse the revised GPB since the prescribed deadline had already lapsed. 

Nonetheless, PCW informed OVP that they may pursue the implementation of 

planned programs and reflect their actual accomplishments for FY 2020. 

 

As of April 7, 2021, the OVP’s GAD Accomplishment Report for FY 2020 

was under review by PCW while its FY 2021 GPB was already endorsed by the 

PCW.  

 

We commended Management for the implementation of 12 GAD 

activities and attribution of its Medical Assistance Program, and recommended 

that they continue to implement GAD activities that respond to gender issues 

within OVP’s organization, and of its clientele. 
 

We further recommended and Management agreed that the GAD Focal 

Point System strictly observe the prescribed deadline on the submission of GPB 

and its revision, if any, to the PCW, and submit the same to the Audit Team.

sanitizers in the workplace and distribution of care packages to staff, which
