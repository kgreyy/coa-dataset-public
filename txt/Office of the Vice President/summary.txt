EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Office of the Vice President (OVP) traces its origin in the 1935 

Constitution when the United States government granted full independence to the 

Philippines after more than 30 years of colonization in the country. 

 

When Martial Law was declared in September 1972, OVP became irrelevant.  

The 1973 Constitution which was ratified and came into effect on January 17, 1973 

did not provide for a Vice President.  In 1984, OVP was restored through a 

Constitutional amendment that was ratified by the people.  After the February 1986 

snap election, the new President and Vice President were installed under 

Proclamation No. 3 dated March 25, 1986.  Subsequently, the 1987 Philippine 

Constitution provided for a Vice President as the second highest official of the land.   

 

OVP was reorganized under Executive Order (EO) No. 240 dated July 24, 

1987, which gave the Vice President the authority to appoint personnel under his 

office except for the positions of Chief of Staff and Assistant Chief of Staff who are 

appointed by the President upon the recommendation of the Vice President.  As the 

second highest office in the land committed to the service of the nation, OVP 

performs executive, ceremonial, and advocacy functions, collaborating with 

stakeholders and organizations in both the public and private sectors, to develop 

and promote programs that uplift the lives of the Filipino people.  

 

After the national elections held in 2016, the Honorable Maria Leonor G. 

Robredo became the Vice President.  She is assisted by Chief of Staff Philip 

Francisco U. Dy and Assistant Chief of Staff Sofia C. Yanto-Abad with the cabinet 

rank of Undersecretary and Assistant Secretary, respectively.  There are 176 filled 

up plantilla positions and 160 non-plantilla positions, as tabulated below:

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of OVP for CY 2020.  It was 

conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the 

Management’s assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the propriety of 

transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and 

regulations; c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and d) determine 

the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.  Moreover, the 

audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 

Institutions (ISSAIs). 

 

 

E. Auditor’s Report on of the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of the 

presentation of the financial statements of OVP as at December 31, 2020. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the significant audit observations and corresponding 

recommendations, details of which are discussed in Part II of this report. 

Management views and comments were incorporated in the report, were 

appropriate.  

 

1. The adjustments and corrections of errors/omissions noted in review of the 
financial statements could have been avoided had there been proper 

evaluation of relevant transactions and coordination of the Accounting 

Division and appropriate offices before recording in the books of accounts 

was undertaken. If not properly addressed, the noted lapses may affect the 



iv 

 

agency’s internal control system relative to the accuracy and reliability of its 

accounting data. (Paragraph no. 1) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. instruct the Accountant to exercise diligence in the review of transactions 
before recording in the books ensuring that the same are recorded to the 

proper accounts prescribed in Volume III of the Government Accounting 

Manual (GAM) in order to present a more reliable financial information; 

 

b. advise the Budget Officer to consider the purpose of the goods to be 
procured by the OVP, and include the same in the appropriate budget line 

item in the proposed annual budget of the agency; 

 

c. direct the Accounting Division and Property Unit to regularly reconcile 
their records to ensure that inventory items at year-end are recorded in the 

appropriate account; and 

 

d. require the Accounting Division and Public Assistance Division (PAD) to 
periodically reconcile their records to ensure the correctness of the 

reported medical assistance; and closely monitor the status of transferred 

funds.  

 

2. Procurement of medical equipment donated to a government hospital 
amounting to ₱3,531,200.00, considered as capital expenditures, was 

improperly charged to allotment for Maintenance and Other Operating 

Expenses (MOOE), inconsistent with Section 17 of the General Provisions 

(GP) of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020 (RA No. 11465). 

(Paragraph no. 2) 

 

We recommended that Management henceforth, ensure that the agency’s 

funds are utilized in accordance with the appropriations authorized for the 

purpose. 

 

3. Financial Reports and supporting documents for CY 2020 were not submitted 
to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed period, contrary to the rules 

and regulations on submission of reports; hence, their timely evaluation, and 

consequently the early detection and immediate communication to 

management of deficiencies, if any, were not done, including the 

corresponding corrective actions to be undertaken. (Paragraph no. 3) 

 

We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to monitor the 

submission of documents in order to keep pace with the deadlines per Section 

7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2019-006, and Section 60, Chapter 19, Volume I 

of the GAM. 

 



v 

 

4. Process gaps were noted in the handling and monitoring of the receipt and 
distribution of donations in-kind, particularly with regard to some incomplete 

and varying information in the Summary/List of Donations Received, 

Distribution and Balances, and distribution list.  Moreover, submission of the 

quarterly report ending December 31, 2020 to the Office of Civil Defense and 

COA was delayed by 34 days contrary to Item II.1 of COA Circular No. 

2020-009 dated April 21, 2020. (Paragraph no. 4) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. investigate the deficiencies noted in the December 31, 2020 report and 
submit a revised/adjusted report duly supported with acknowledgement 

receipt for the donations received and distribution list duly received by 

the beneficiaries/recipients; 

 

b. submit information on the status of undistributed items; 
 

c. strengthen controls on the handling, monitoring and reporting of 
donations by institutionalizing systematic processes of accepting, 

recording and distribution of donations received to ensure that donations 

are fully and properly accounted for; 

 

d. review and prepare diligently the report before submission to concerned 
agencies; and 

 

e. submit the succeeding Summary/List of Donations Received, Distributed 
and Balances to OCD and COA within the period prescribed under COA 

Circular No. 2020-009. 

 

 

G. Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 

Of the 12 audit recommendations contained in CY 2019 Annual Audit Report 

(AAR), 11 were implemented and one was not implemented.  The details are 

presented in Part III of this report.
