EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





Introduction



In 1911, the Bicol State College of Applied Sciences and Technology (BISCAST) started as the Camarines Sur Trade School (CSTS) offering trade courses in the intermediate level such as carpentry, drawing and trade arts. 



By virtue of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 825 which was approved on August 15, 1952, the school was nationalized and renamed Camarines Sur National School of Arts and Trades (CSNSAT). In 1954, the two-year post-secondary trade-technical education was offered.



Upon its conversion to a full-fledged College by virtue of R.A. No. 5056, the CSNSAT was converted into a College and renamed as Bicol College of Arts and Trades (BCAT) and was authorized to offer courses like Bachelor of Science in Industrial Education (BSIE). Before it formally assumed its name as BCAT, it was known as Camarines Sur National College of Arts and Trades (CSNCAT) until in the mid 1980’s when it adapted its name BCAT.  



In December 2000, pursuant to RA No. 8760, on the integration of Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Supervised Institution (CSI’s) to State Universities and Colleges (SUCs), the Bicol College of Arts and Trades was formerly integrated with the Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges (CSPC) in Nabua, Camarines Sur. For more than 11 years, it existed as the CSPC Naga Campus. 



On October 19, 2012, President Benigno Aquino III signed R.A. No. 10231 formally separating the school from CSPC and renaming it the Bicol State College of Applied Sciences and Technology (BISCAST) with its first SUC President, Dr. Richard H. Cordial. 



Effective August 20, 2018 BISCAST became a SUC Level II accredited institution pursuant to CHED Memorandum Order No. 9 series of 2019 with President, Dr. Richard H. Cordial as SUC President II until March 7, 2021. Dr. Alex H. Navarroza assumed as newly appointed SUC President II on March 8, 2021.

Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the College’s financial statements for CY 2020 because of the following audit observations:



1)	Prior year’s audit observation on the inadequate controls and/or procedures over inventory management system remained unacted upon, such as the absence of complete and updated Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs), non-reconciliation of the Accounting and Inventory Custodian’s records and non-recording of issuances to end users expenses remained unacted upon, thus, the accuracy and reliability of the inventory accounts balances amounting to ₱14.90 million could not be ascertained. Likewise, issued semi-expendable properties amounting to ₱17.95 million per Supply and Property Office records were still in the books of accounts, hence, overstating the inventory accounts and understating the expense accounts by the same amount.



2)	The existence and correctness of the balances of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts per books amounting to ₱372.18 million as of December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained due to the non-reconciliation of the Accounting and Property records, erroneous/double recording in the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) amounting to ₱38.54 million and inclusion of items below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000. 



3)	Accounts Payable balance of ₱43.82 million as of December 31, 2020 includes obligations not yet due and demandable in the amount of ₱20.64 million and delivered goods not yet accepted valued at ₱2.60 million, resulting in the misstatement of the corresponding accounts in the financial statements. Likewise, non-reversion of undocumented accounts payables outstanding for two years and more totaling ₱0.59 million affected the validity and regularity of the account.

Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 



For the exceptions mentioned earlier the Auditor recommended that Management:



			1)	Require the Accounting and Supply Office to:



a)	Maintain and update the recording of the receipts, issuances and corresponding balances in the SLCs. It shall be maintained for each type of supplies and materials for easy reconciliation with Supply Office at any given time;



b)	Conduct periodic reconciliation of their respective records for a reliable inventory account balances; 



c)	Trace the discrepancies and effect the necessary adjustments on the affected inventory accounts; and 



d)	Fast track the process of collating the Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS), Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) and other documents pertaining to prior years’ issuances to support and facilitate the necessary adjustments of the related accounts in the books of the College.



			2)	 Take the following courses of action:



a)	Immediately require the Property Officer and the Accountant to reconcile the RPCPPE with the General Ledger balances and make the necessary adjustments for the discrepancies noted in audit amounting to ₱23.35 million, to present the correct PPE account balance in their respective books and records;



b)	Require the Property Unit to remove from the reported PPEs in the RPCPPE, items below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000 pursuant to Section 4, Chapter 10 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume 1; and



c)	Require the Accounting Unit to prepare adjusting entries to correct the overstatement of asset and equity accounts for those semi-expendable property already issued to end-users as supported with duly accomplished Inventory Custodian Slips (ICS). 

	

			3)	Require the Accountant to: 



a)	Strictly follow the guidelines in the recording of transactions as Accounts Payable;



b)	Revert all outstanding Accounts Payable aged two years and above, particularly those which are not supported with valid documents/records; 



c)	Stop the practice of recording the goods/services/projects which are not yet delivered/rendered/completed and accepted as Accounts Payable, regardless of the year when these obligations are incurred. Likewise, refrain from procuring machinery and equipment if the place where it will be installed is not yet ready to avoid deterioration and exposure thereof to the elements that may lessen their useful life; and



d)	Prepare adjusting journal entries to correct the affected accounts.



Moreover, the following are the significant observations and the corresponding recommendations:



			1)	Unserviceable properties totaling ₱6.11 million were still included in the RPCPPE while semi-expendable/waste materials of undetermined amount were junked and stockpiled at various areas within the campus posing health risk and eye sore to the school community and exposing these properties/waste materials to further deterioration and loss of value, contrary to the pertinent provisions of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, R.A. No. 11465 and GAM for NGAs, Volume 1. Also, disposed/demolished properties remained in the books, thus, overstating the affected asset accounts in the financial statements.



We recommended that Management comply with the following courses of action:



a)	Require the Disposal Committee or other concerned office to act on the stockpiled semi expendable/waste materials and dispose them accordingly;  



b)	Direct the Supply/Property Office to identify all unserviceable government properties and prepare the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) or Waste Materials Report (WMR) to facilitate proper disposal thereof. Said reports and other related documents must also be submitted to the Accounting Office and COA for recording and audit, respectively; 



c)	Instruct the Accountant to make the necessary adjusting entries to drop or derecognize the disposed and demolished properties from the books. The JEV together with the IIRUP, WMR and other documents relative to the demolition and disposal of the property must be submitted to the Auditor for post-audit; and



d)	Henceforth, Management is enjoined to observe the proper guidelines/procedures in all demolitions and disposals of government properties pursuant to COA Circular No. 95-006 and the GAM for NGAs. 



			2)	Two infrastructure projects completed and turned-over to the Agency in CYs 2018 and 2019 totaling ₱73.48 million did not have the necessary occupancy permits, thus, remained idle and unutilized in CY 2020, depriving the stakeholders of the timely use thereof. Further, the Learning Innovation and Entrepreneurship Building Phase 1 and 2 projects remained inoperative, thus, depriving the College of the much-needed funds that could have been realized from the operation of the income generating project in the said building, with projected annual revenue of ₱2.67 million.



We recommended that Management comply with the following:



a)	Immediately secure or follow up the occupancy permits of the completed constructed building to ensure their conformity to safety and other standard requirements; and 



b)	Exert more effort to make the buildings available for its intended use and to enable the College to generate revenues that may be used for its operations. 



			3)	The inability of the Agency to ensure completion of five infrastructure projects with total contract cost of ₱87.03 million manifests Management’s inefficiency in the monitoring and implementation thereof, thereby depriving the end-users of timely usage of the facilities/structures and may result in wastage of government funds.



We recommended that Management:



a)	Exert more effort to ensure that the five infrastructure projects are completed so that the intended use thereof can be enjoyed by the beneficiaries of the projects; 



b)	Require the Project Engineers to monitor closely and supervise the project implementation in accordance with the plans, specifications and timelines, and institute appropriate penalties, where necessary, to protect the interest of the government; 



c)	Impose liquidated damages and other applicable sanctions against the contractors with delayed implementation of their projects, if warranted; and



d)	Require the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) and the Technical Working Group (TWG) to thoroughly and strictly review the post-qualification of contractors in terms of manpower, equipment requirements and performances on on-going and completed government and private civil works contracts. 



			4)		Two contracts for infrastructure projects totaling ₱48.49 million that were not completed after they were abandoned by the contractors were not rescinded and the contractors’ performance securities were not forfeited, resulting in the overpayment representing the unrecouped advance payment to the contractor amounting to ₱4.54 million.



We recommended that Management take the following courses of action:

	

						a)	Immediately rescind the contract on the two projects and award the same to other qualified contractors and ensure that the projects are completed;



						b)	Recommend the blacklisting of the two contractors to the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB);



						c)	Enforce recovery of the performance security or warranty posted by the contractors from the Insurance Company where the surety bonds were obtained;



						d)	Apply all possible remedies in order to recover the unrecouped advance payment to the contractor; and



						e)	Institute other applicable sanctions against the contractors pursuant to existing regulations.



			5)	Claims of contractors for various on-going and completed infrastructure projects implemented by the College were not supported with complete documentation, contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001, thereby, affecting the validity and propriety of the transactions.



We recommended that Management comply with the following:



a)	Submit all the lacking supporting documents as well as written explanation on the noted deficiencies for audit verification and evaluation; and 



b)	Henceforth, ensure that all disbursements are properly supported with complete documentation to avoid possible suspension in audit.



			6)	Copies of Variation/Extra Work Order (EWO) and extension of contract time and their supporting documents for the five infrastructure projects totaling ₱85.24 million were not submitted to the Audit Team within five working days after its approval, thus, prevented the timely conduct of auditorial review and technical evaluation by the Regional Technical Services Office as required in COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009.



We recommended that Management:



a)	Strictly comply with the prompt submission of copies of variation/extra work orders and approved time extensions together with the necessary supporting documents enumerated in Annexes B and E of COA Circular No. 2009-001; and



b)	Review and evaluate thoroughly the Program of Works (POW) to ensure that project designs and estimates are properly prepared and all phases of the projects are covered to minimize variation orders and time extensions which often results in increased cost and delayed project completion.



			7)	Monetary PRAISE incentive totaling ₱5.19 million granted to 173 employees and some retirees was not supported with necessary documents, contrary to Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 01, s. 2001 and Joint Resolution No. 4 s. 2009, thus, casting doubt on the regularity and validity of the transaction. 

We recommended that Management comply with the following courses of action:



a)	Submit documents to show that there were acceptable exemplary achievements which resulted in monetary savings that made the personnel of the College eligible to receive said incentive;



b)	Proof that there were available savings from Personnel Services of the General Appropriations Act in FY 2020; and



c)	Refrain from granting allowances, benefits and incentives without legal basis to avoid possible disallowance in audit.





	The afore-cited observations and recommendations were discussed with concerned officials of BiSCAST during the exit conference held on April 12, 2021. Management views and reactions were considered in the Report, where it is deemed appropriate.
