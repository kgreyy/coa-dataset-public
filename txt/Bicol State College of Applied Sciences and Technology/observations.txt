OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 





A)	FINANCIAL AND COMPLIANCE AUDIT



1)	Cash advances granted to Special Disbursing Officers (SDOs) and other Officials and employees were not settled as soon as the purposes for which they were given have been served.



	Section 89 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that No cash advance shall be given unless for a legally authorized specific purpose. A cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served.  No additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.



Section 5.8 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, states that, All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year. Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipt.



Section 1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, prescribes the following:



	The accountable officer shall liquidate cash advances within the following period:

	

--	Salaries, Wages, Allowances, Honoraria and Other Similar Payments – within five calendar days after the end of the pay period.



--	Field Operating Expenses – within 20 calendar days after the end of the year subject to replenishment as frequently as necessary during the year.



--	Petty Cash Fund (PCF) – as soon as the disbursements reaches 75 percent or as needed, the PCF shall be replenished which shall be equal to the total amount of expenditures made therefrom. In case of termination, resignation, retirement or dismissal of the PCF custodian, immediately thereafter.



--	Traveling Expenses – within 30 days after the return of the official/ employee concerned to his official station for local travel and within 60 after the return of the official/ employee concerned to the Philippines in the case of foreign travel.



--	Special purpose – as soon as the purpose of the cash advance has been served.



Verification of the balance of receivables account in the financial statement showed various unliquidated cash advances granted to SDOs and various officers and employees for special purpose and travel expenses amounting to ₱0.53 million and ₱101,820, respectively, or a total of ₱0.63 million as of December 31, 2020.

As can be gleaned from the above table, ₱436,398 or 82.11 per cent of the total unliquidated balance of ₱0.53 million representing cash advances granted to SDOs for specific purpose and/or time-bounded activities were already past due, for a period ranging from less than one year to over two years. Similarly, ₱101,820 of the cash advances granted to various College employees for travelling expenses remained unsettled/unliquidated as of December 31, 2020.



Further verification revealed that most of the unliquidated cash advances were granted to the SDO for the payment of honoraria of the Board of Trustees (BOT) and search committee, expenses for various school activities and celebrations, projects, and notarial and courier fees amounting to ₱254,384, ₱147,064, ₱100,000, and ₱30,000, respectively. Presented hereunder is a summary of the cash advances granted to the SDOs and other officers and employees, liquidations and balance as at December 31, 2020.

The non-liquidation of cash advances contravenes the rules and regulations on the granting, utilization of cash advances and exposes government funds to possible risk of loss and/or misuse.



According to the College Accountant, letters were already sent to the accountable officers and employees demanding settlement of their unliquidated cash advances. Also, notices will be sent to the SDOs and other officials and employees whose cash advances remain unsettled, with provision for withholding of their respective salary should they fail to liquidate the said cash advances within the prescribed period, as sanctioned under COA Circular No. 97-002. 



We recommended that Management require the SDOs and other concerned personnel to immediately liquidate their cash advances particularly those that are already due for liquidation and ensure that in the succeeding transactions, all cash advances are properly liquidated/refunded as soon as the purpose for which they were granted has been served to avoid accumulation of unliquidated cash advances at year-end.





1)	Additional cash advances were granted to SDOs and other personnel despite previous unliquidated balances.



Section 4.1.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, states that:



No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.



Examination of the transactions relative to the grant of cash advances disclosed that additional cash advances were granted to the accountable officers despite non-settlement/liquidation of previous cash advances. Details of the grant, liquidations and frequency of granting cash advances to officers and employees of the College are shown below:

	As shown on the table above, three SDOs and six officers and employees of the College were granted additional cash advances ranging from two to 28 times. The numerous granting of cash advances to an Accountable Officer resulted in the accumulation of unliquidated cash advances amounting to ₱0.54 million. 



The holding of cash advances for an extended period of time and the practice of granting additional cash advances despite inability of accountable officers to liquidate previous cash advances does not only manifest non-adherence to the above cited rules and regulation but could also imply that the funds entrusted by the government to the accountable officers may be used for purposes other than those for which the cash advances were granted, thus, exposing government funds to possible misuse. 



The Accounting Office promised to strictly enforce the “No Prior Liquidation, No Subsequent Cash Advance Policy” to comply with the rules and regulations on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances provided under COA Circular No. 97-002.



We recommended that Management take the following courses of action:



a)	Instruct the Accountant to stop granting of additional cash advances to SDOs and officers and employees unless the previous cash advances granted to them are first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made; 



b)	Ensure that the subsidiary ledgers (SL) for cash advances are regularly updated for reference in the granting of additional cash advances;



c)	Require the SDOs and the concerned employees to liquidate and/or refund immediately the unspent balances of cash advances; and



d)	Henceforth, strictly enforce the rules and regulations on granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances to avoid accumulation of unsettled balances.





2)	Cash advances granted to SDOs were transferred to and utilized by another personnel of the State College.



Section 4.1.6 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 states that: Transfer of cash advance from one Accountable Officer (AO) to another shall not be allowed.

	Evaluation of the balances of unliquidated cash advances showed that several cash advances was granted to SDOs on various dates totaling ₱255,564. The details of which are shown below:

Interview with the concerned Accountable Officers revealed that the custody/ possession of the proceeds of cash advances and the utilization thereof were entrusted to other school personnel who are not authorized to handle the funds. Cash were transferred by the accountable officers and acknowledged by the school personnel by signing in the logbook or as evidenced by a certification of the SDO of such transfer while there was also some instance wherein no proof of receipt or transfer of funds was secured by the SDO, thus, causing undue delay in the liquidation of cash advances and exposing government funds to possible risk of loss or misappropriation. 



	We also noted that a cash advance amounting to ₱100,000 was used as payment for the materials and project implementation for the fabrication of ventilator. Said practice was contrary to Section 1.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 which provides that: “No cash advance shall be granted for payments on account of infrastructure projects or other undertaking on a project basis.”



	Moreover, cash advances amounting to ₱129,321 were spent for the expenses for meals, supplies, materials and other incidental expenses during the celebration of the College Charter Anniversary last November 2019. However, procurement thereto was not made in accordance with the pertinent provisions of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184 as the expenses were just charged to the cash advances without following the procurement processes required in the said regulation which states that:



xx It is the policy of the GOP that procurement of Goods, Infrastructure Projects and Consulting Services shall be competitive and transparent, and therefore shall undergo competitive bidding, except as provided in Rule XVI of this IRR.



The abovementioned practices are contrary to existing rules and regulations in the granting and utilization of cash advances, thereby, casting doubt on the validity and regularity of the transactions. 



Management averred that cash advances will no longer be transferred to another person and that the utilization and liquidation thereof will be strictly imposed on the accountable officer who made the cash advances. They also agreed on the audit recommendation of not using cash advances as payment for the procurement of goods and projects that are within the ambit of RA No. 9184 and its IRR.



We recommended that Management:



a)	Instruct the SDOs to stop the practice of transferring the cash advances to other personnel pursuant to COA Circular No. 97-002;



b)	Require the designated SDOs to undertake the appropriate utilization and liquidation of their cash advances; and



c)	Refrain from paying out of cash advances for projects undertaken by the College and procurement of goods for various celebration. All procurements must be in accordance with the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 for transparency and competitiveness.





3)	Receivables from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for the tuition and other school fees in the amount of ₱25.1 million as of December 31, 2020 under the Free Higher Education (FHE) Program under RA No. 10931 was inappropriately debited to Accounts Receivable instead of Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) account. Likewise, the related transactions were not adequately supported with necessary documents.



COA Circular No. 2020-01 prescribing the Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) states that Due from NGAs is debited to recognize advances for purchase of goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers to the NGAs for implementation of projects and other receivables from NGAs and credited upon receipt of goods/services, liquidation of fund transfers, receipt of payment, settlement, write-off, and/or adjustments. Accounts receivable account on the other hand, is debited to recognize the amount due from customers arising from regular trade and business transactions. 



The College is eligible to provide the FHE program as stated under Section 5 of the IRR of RA No. 10931. The benefits include among others, free tuition for all courses/subject/classes enrolled during a particular semester, and free miscellaneous, other school and related fees.



The IRR further provides that State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) shall bill the CHED every semester based on actual qualified students who availed the FHE program.  



	Review of the financial statements as of December 31, 2020 showed that the Accounts Receivable account has a balance of ₱25.1 million. Verification of the transactions affecting the account revealed that these pertain to receivables from CHED for tuition and other school fees for the second semester of Academic Year (AY) 2019-2020 and first semester of AY 2020-2021 for college enrollees and the corresponding collections made therefrom during CY 2020. Details are as follows:

	Further verification of the related transactions revealed the following deficiencies:



--	The amount of ₱43.9 million billed during the year was not supported with Billing Statements duly acknowledged by CHED. Also, the attached copy of the enrollment/Assessment Summary for the 1st Semester AY 2020-2021 prepared by the Billing Clerk at the Accounting Office was not reviewed and signed or certified as correct by the authorized official;



--	The adjusted amount of ₱0.50 million was not supported with details on how the adjusting entry was arrived at. The “should be” accounting journal entry was not presented to facilitate review and verification; and



--	The total amount of ₱40.9 million credited to the LBP Account No. 0042-1214-88 of the College was recorded as collection during the year. However, this was not supported with a credit memo. 



The receivables from CHED and the corresponding collections should have been accounted under Due from NGAs account in conformity with the above cited regulations. As a result, the Accounts Receivable was overstated and the Due from NGAs was understated in the same amount of ₱25.1 million as of December 31, 2020. 



The improper classification made pertaining to the recognition of the receivables is not in conformity with the Revised Chart of Accounts and may mislead the users of the College’s financial report as it does not reflect the true nature of the affected asset accounts. Although these accounts are considered asset accounts under Receivables, it is still necessary that the accounts to be used should be in accordance with the descriptions in the Revised Chart of Accounts for proper classification of the transactions in the financial statements.



We recommended and Management agreed to comply with the following:



a)	Require the Accountant to make the necessary adjusting entries to correct the balances of both the AR and Due from NGAs accounts; 



b)	Ensure that tuition and other school fees of the students that are billed to and collected from CHED are recorded under the Due from NGAs account;



c)	Ensure that JEVs for adjustments made in the books are supported with complete details/particulars and explanation; and  



d)	Submit to the Audit Team the following documents for further verification:



--	Copy of the approved billing statements duly received by CHED;

--	Original copy of Enrollment/Assessment Summary for the 1st Semester AY 2020-2021 duly reviewed or certified as correct by authorized official; and

--	Copies of Credit Memo for the amount deposited or credited to LBP Account No. 0042-1214-88 of the College.





4)	Prior year’s audit observation on the inadequate controls and/or procedures over inventory management system remained unacted upon. Likewise, issued semi-expendable properties per Supply and Property Office records were still in the books of accounts amounting to ₱17.95 million.



This is a reiteration of the previous years’ audit observations and recommendations.



Sections 44 to 45 of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 12 provide the subsequent recognition of inventories as expense as follows:

1)	When inventories are sold, exchanged, or distributed, the carrying amount of those inventories shall be recognized as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. If there is no related revenue, the expense is recognized when the goods are distributed or the related service is rendered. Xxx



2)	For a service provider, the point when inventories are recognized as expenses normally occurs when services are rendered, or upon billing for chargeable services.



Volume II of the Government Accounting Manual for NGAs provides for the following:



Appendix 57 – Supplies Ledger Card



D. The agency shall conduct physical count of inventories every semester. The semestral physical inventory of supplies shall be reconciled with the SLCs and controlling accounts and Supply and/or Property records. Any discrepancies shall be immediately verified and adjusted.



Appendix 58 – Stock Card



D. The agency shall conduct physical count of inventories every semester. The semestral physical inventory of supplies shall be reconciled with the SLCs and controlling accounts and Supply and/or Property records. Any discrepancies shall be immediately verified and adjusted.



Appendix 66 – Report on the Physical Count of Inventories



C. The report shall be reconciled with the SLCs and SCs maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit, and Property and/or Supply Division/Unit, respectively. Any discrepancy shall be verified and/or adjusted accordingly.



Section 53b of Government Auditing Standards and Procedures and Internal Control System (Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM), Volume III) states that: This standard further requires comparison of recorded accountability with existing assets to determine whether the actual assets agree with the recorded accountability. Any discrepancy should be investigated in accordance with existing regulations and appropriate action taken thereon.



	Review of the inventory accounts as of December 31, 2020 disclosed material variance between the recorded inventory per books and actual inventory count as reported in the Report on Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) by ₱13.41 million. The details are presented in the table next page.

	The above listed accounts showed that the balance of inventory per books significantly differs with the actual physical count of inventory reported in the RPCI. This can be greatly attributed to the delayed recording in the Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs), with latest available records as of September 2020 only. It was also noted that the prepared SLCs were consolidated based on the account classification instead of by type of supplies and materials.



The inability to reconcile records with actual count did not present the real figures on inventory and expense accounts for a certain period, thus, affecting the accuracy and reliability of Inventory accounts as presented in the financial statements.



	Interview with the personnel-in-charge revealed that the delay in posting in the SLCs was due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and prioritizing in the updating of issuances of semi-expendable properties for CY 2020. The personnel of the concerned offices also informed the Audit Team that they are still in the process of reconciling the inventories particularly the non-moving accounts in the books.



Further, semi-expendable properties likewise disclosed discrepancies showing a total balance in the books amounting to ₱17.95 million while per Supply Office records, all stocks were already issued to the end users. Details of the recorded semi-expendable properties are shown below:

Relative thereto, the Supply Office personnel explained that the inventories and semi expendable properties procured during the year under audit were already 95 per cent issued to end users and were properly supported with Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) and Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI). However, they are still in the process of collating the RIS, RSMI and other documents pertaining to prior years’ issuances to support and facilitate the necessary adjustments of the affected accounts in the books of accounts of the College.



	Due to the above noted deficiencies, the reliability and accuracy of the reported year-end balances of inventories and semi expendable properties valued at ₱14.90 million and ₱17.95 million, respectively, could not be ascertained.  Likewise, lost inventories, if any, could not be promptly determined since accountability thereof has not been accurately established.



Management averred that the Accounting Office is constantly updating its Supplies Ledger Cards and necessary efforts will be exerted to address the discrepancies through the reconciliation of the Accounting and Supply Office records. 



Also, the Supply Office is already prioritizing the reconciliation of existing inventory and determining prior years’ issuances to facilitate reconciliation of the account balances.



We recommended that Management require the Accounting and Supply Office to:



a)	Maintain and update the recording of the receipts, issuances and corresponding balances in the SLCs. It shall be maintained for each type of supplies and materials for easy reconciliation with Supply Office at any given time;



b)	Conduct periodic reconciliation of their respective records for a reliable inventory account balances;



c)	Trace the discrepancies and effect the necessary adjustments on the affected inventory accounts; and 



d)	Fast track the process of collating the RIS, RSMI and other documents pertaining to prior years’ issuances to support and facilitate the necessary adjustments of the related accounts in the books of the College.





6.  The existence and correctness of balances of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts per books amounting to ₱372.18 million as of December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained due to non-reconciliation of accounting and property records, erroneous/double recording in the RPCPPE amounting to ₱38.54 million and inclusion of items below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000. 



Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs Volume 1 provides the following applicable regulations:



Section 38. Physical Count of PPE. The entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 71) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording.



Sec. 4. Applying the Capitalization Threshold of ₱15,000.00. The capitalization threshold of ₱15,000 represents the minimum cost of an individual asset recognized as a PPE on the Statement of Financial Position.



a)	Items with individual values below the threshold but which work together on the form of a group of network asset whose total value exceeds the threshold shall be recognized as part of the primary PPE. Xxx.



b)	This threshold shall be applied on an individual asset or per item basis. Each item within the bulk acquisition with aggregate or total value of PPE, such as library books, computer peripherals and small items of equipment, will need to meet the capitalization threshold to be recognized as PPE.



Section 10, Chapter 8 of the same Manual states that Tangible items below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 shall be accounted as semi-expendable property.



a)	Semi expendable property which were recognized as PPE shall be reclassified to the affected account.

b)	The Tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon issue to the end-user.



Section 11 also provides that Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) (Appendix 59) shall be issued to end user of Semi–expendable Property to establish accountability over them.  Accountability shall be extinguished upon return of the item to the Property and Supply Division/Unit or in case of loss, upon approval of the relief from property accountability.



Moreover, Section 53b of Government Auditing Standards and Procedures and Internal Control System (GAAM Volume III) states that: This standard further requires comparison of recorded accountability with existing assets to determine whether the actual assets agree with the recorded accountability. Any discrepancy should be investigated in accordance with existing regulations and appropriate action taken thereon.

	Comparison of the recorded amount of PPE as of December 31, 2020 with the submitted Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) revealed a difference of ₱23.35 million, as shown in the table below:

	The unreconciled amount pertains to various PPEs such as Information and Communication Technology Equipment, Office Equipment, Books, Technical and Scientific Equipment, and Other Machinery and Equipment, with material discrepancies of (₱35.64 million), ₱13.17 million, (₱5.16 million), ₱3.37 million and ₱2.45 million, respectively. Verification of the variance revealed erroneous recording of the unit value of 27 sets of computer units under the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Equipment account resulting in the overstatement thereof by ₱37.17 million. Details showing the comparison between the recorded ICT Equipment and verification of pertinent documents are presented on the next page.

Further inquiry with the Supply Office personnel revealed that only 80 per cent of the PPEs were physically counted while the remaining 20 per cent is still subject for reconciliation of their records, hence, the variance due to incomplete inventory report submitted. 



Moreover, review of the RPCPPE disclosed that one NP 300 Navarra 4x4 EL 6MT pick-up truck with stock number MV-12-19-008 valued at ₱1.36 million was recorded twice under Motor Vehicles and Other Transportation Equipment account resulting to an overstatement in the reported PPE.

	Periodic reconciliation of the accounting and property records with the result of physical inventory taking will promptly detect shortages, losses and errors in recording, thus, ensure the correctness and reliability of the reported balances in the financial statements and pinpoint property accountability.



In addition to the above deficiencies, items below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000 erroneously classified as PPE in the RPCPPE were also noted. Said items are considered semi- expendable properties, hence, shall be reported initially as inventories in the RPCI.  Summary of items below the capitalization threshold is shown below:

It is also worthy to note that the balance of ₱174,553 should have already been recognized as expenses since they were already issued to end users. The non-recognition of expenses upon issuance of inventories resulted in the overstatement of the related Asset and Equity accounts. 



Considering the materiality of the discrepancies noted in audit, the PPE account balances amounting to ₱329.6 million as of December 31, 2020 cannot be relied upon, thereby affecting the fair presentation thereof in the financial statements. 



	Management will comply with the audit recommendations by conducting periodic reconciliation and adjustment of related accounts.



In view thereof, we recommended that Management:



a)	Immediately require the Property Officer and the Accountant to reconcile the RPCPPE with the General Ledger balances and make the necessary adjustments for the discrepancies noted in audit amounting to ₱23.35 million to present the correct PPE account balance in their respective books and records;



b)	Require the Property Unit to remove from the reported PPEs in the RPCPPE, items below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000 pursuant to Section 4, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume 1; and 



c)	Require the Accounting Unit to prepare adjusting entries to correct the overstatement of asset and equity accounts for those semi-expendable property already issued to end-users as supported with duly accomplished Inventory Custodian Slips (ICS). 





1)	Unserviceable properties totaling ₱6.11 million were still included in the RPCPPE while semi-expendable/waste materials of undetermined amount were junked and stockpiled at various areas within the campus. Also, disposed/demolished properties remained in the books, overstating the affected asset accounts in the financial statements.



	Section 14 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, the General Appropriations Act for FY 2020 provides that Departments, Bureaus, Offices, and instrumentalities of the National Government xxx are hereby authorized to sell non-serviceable, obsolete, or unnecessary equipment, including motor vehicles in accordance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445, EO No. 309 s. 1996 and such other guidelines issued thereon. The proceeds from the sale of such equipment shall be deposited with the National Treasury as income of the General Fund pursuant to Section 44, Chapter 5, Book VI of EO No. 292. 



Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides the regulation for the destruction or sale of unserviceable property, as follows:



When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefor, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the property committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the Commission, after advertising by printed notice in the Official Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of general circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the expense of publication, by notices posted for a like period in at least three public places in the locality where the property is to be sold. In the event that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned and approved by the Commission.



Section 40.d of Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I also states that all unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74). 



Section 39 of the same Manual provides for the derecognition of PPE. It states that the cost of PPE together with the related accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss shall be removed from the accounts (2014 ed. Financial Accounting, Volume 1, Valix). The carrying amount of an item of PPE shall be derecognized on disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected from its use or disposal.



Further, Sections 6.09 and 6.10 of COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 state the following:



Sec.6.09 Inspection of xxx, as well as unserviceable and disposable government property and other assets, shall be conducted by management. A copy of the report of inspection or its equivalent shall be submitted to the Head of the Auditing Unit within xxx in the case of unserviceable and disposable property/assets, immediately after inspection thereof by management.



Sec.6.10 Management shall furnish the Auditor with a copy of the schedule or notice of the xxx condemnation/destruction of government property and other disposable assets, as the case may be, at least five (5) days before scheduled time.



The IIRUP, Waste Material Report (WMR) and other related documents must be prepared by the Supply & Property Office to properly account for all the unserviceable/disposable properties. From this report, the Disposal Committee can conduct the appropriate disposal either thru auction sale if still with value or any other modes applicable thereto. These reports must be submitted to the Audit Team immediately after the conduct of inspection and to the Accounting Office after the completion of disposal. 



Review of the RPCPPE as of December 31, 2020 revealed that some of the reported PPEs were identified as unserviceable properties. However, said items were not yet reported in the IIRUP and still included in the physical inventory of PPE. The summary of these accounts is presented below (Annex A for the detailed presentation):

	According to the staff-in-charge in the Property/Supply Unit, an IIRUP was prepared as of June 30, 2020 and the disposal procedures were already started. However, verification of the said report revealed that only the unserviceable school bus (SHA-965) with unit cost of ₱0.70 million was reported therein and had it sold thru auction in January 2021. It was also learned from the Head of the Disposal Committee that an unserviceable armored car allegedly donated to the school was recently disposed. This was reported in the WMR but was not previously recognized as an asset of the agency as there was no proof of donation or any document that can be used as basis in recording thereof in the books. The vehicle was kept by the agency for several years but the Management took no action to facilitate its inclusion in the books. Instead, they just push-through with the disposal of the property and classified it as waste material. 



	Moreover, verification of the existence of the recorded Buildings and Other Structures valued at ₱170.76 million revealed that there were four buildings already demolished but were still carried in the books as of December 31, 2020. The Physical Plant Development and Maintenance Services (PPDMS) identifies the demolished buildings as the Old Administrative Building, Old Guest House, Trade and Credit Cooperative Building and Mechanical Building. However, due to inadequate records, only two of the demolished buildings were identified with details shown below:

The Supply Officer admitted that they were not able to prepare and submit the needed documents to the Accounting Office to facilitate the derecognition of the said demolished buildings.

Due to the afore-mentioned deficiencies, the submitted RPCPPE was unreliable as the unserviceable and disposed properties were still included therein. Also, the balances of the PPE accounts where these unserviceable properties were recorded are overstated and the booked-up Buildings were overstated due to the inclusion of the demolished old administrative building and old guest house valued at ₱0.54 million and ₱65,000, respectively. 



Moreover, ocular inspection by the Audit Team last February 23, 2020 disclosed several semi expendable/waste materials stockpiled on various open spaces/areas within the campus and were not properly segregated exposing the same to further deterioration and loss of value due to wear and tear. Consequently, the agency is deprived of any additional income that could be generated from the sale of these items.



Management agreed to comply with the recommendations of identifying the unserviceable properties and preparation of the IIRUP. Also, periodic reconciliation of PPEs will be done preferably every end of each month, and adjusting entries will be made, if warranted.



We recommended that Management comply with the following courses of action:



a)	Require the Disposal Committee or other concerned office to act on the stockpiled semi expendable/waste materials and dispose them accordingly;  



b)	Direct the Supply/Property Office to identify all unserviceable government properties and prepare the IIRUP or WMR to facilitate proper disposal thereof. Said reports and other related documents to be submitted to the Accounting Office and COA for recording and audit, respectively; 



c)	Instruct the Accountant to make the necessary adjusting entries to drop or derecognize the disposed and demolished properties from the books. The JEV together with the IIRUP, WMR and other documents relative to the demolition and disposal of the property to be submitted to the auditor for post-audit; and



d)	Henceforth, Management is enjoined to observe the proper guidelines/procedures in all demolitions and disposals of government properties pursuant to COA Circular No. 95-006 and the GAM for NGAs. 





2)	Accounts Payable balance amounting to ₱43.82 million as of December 31, 2020 includes obligations not yet due and demandable and delivered goods not yet accepted. Likewise, non-reversion of undocumented accounts payables outstanding for two years and more affected the validity and regularity of the said transactions.



Section 98 of PD No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, pertains to the reversion of unliquidated balances of accounts payable and is quoted as follows:



The Commission, upon notice to the head of the agency concerned, may revert to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund of the national government, any unliquidated balance of accounts payable in the books of the national government, which has been outstanding for two years or more and against which no actual claim, administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by perfected contracts on record. Xxx



Section 2, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, defines accounts payable as follows:



a)	Accounts Payable – refers to valid and legal obligations of NGAs/OUs, for which, goods/services/projects have been delivered/rendered/completed and accepted, regardless of the year when these obligations were incurred.



	Review of the Schedule of Aging of Accounts Payable disclosed that as of December 31, 2020, there were obligations which were not yet due and demandable but already taken up as Accounts Payable in the total amount of ₱23.24 million. The amount is comprised of the remaining unclaimed balance of the contract price for the project “Completion of Learning Innovation and Entrepreneurship Building for AST” in the amount of ₱20.64 million which was already recorded as a debit to Construction in Progress – Building and Other Structures account despite absence of proof of accomplishment. 



Likewise, procurement of the Universal Testing Machine and Other Accessories amounting to ₱2.60 million delivered on July 6, 2020 under Delivery Receipt No. 32805 was already taken up in the books as a debit to Other Machinery & Equipment account and credited to Accounts Payable even if this was not yet accepted pending installation and testing. Details are presented hereunder:

Also, the Schedule of Accounts Payable included obligations amounting to ₱0.59 million which were outstanding for two years and more and with doubtful existence due to the absence of documents/records to substantiate valid claims, but were still not reverted to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund. Details are presented in Annex B.

	The aforementioned practice of the College in recording obligations not yet due and demandable as Accounts Payables is tantamount to blind certification of Accounts Payable. Likewise, the inclusion of goods not yet accepted contradicts the definition of Accounts Payable, and the non-reversion of unliquidated balances of accounts payable as mandated in Section 98 of PD No. 1445, resulted in the misstatement of the balances of the Accounts Payable and other related accounts in the financial statements as at year-end.



The Budget Office and the Accounting Office will no longer record as Accounts Payable goods/services/projects which are not yet delivered/rendered completed and accepted. Outstanding Accounts Payable aged two years and above with no supporting documents will be reverted.



We recommended that Management require the Accountant to: 



a)	Strictly follow the guidelines in the recording of transactions as Accounts Payable;



b)	Revert all outstanding A/Ps aged two years and above, particularly those which are not supported with valid documents/records; 



c)	Stop the practice of recording those goods/services/projects which were not yet delivered/rendered/completed and accepted as Accounts Payable, regardless of the year when these obligations were incurred. Likewise, refrain from procuring machinery and equipment if the place where it will be installed is not yet ready to avoid deterioration and exposure thereof to the elements that may lessen their useful life; and



d)	Prepare adjusting journal entries to correct affected accounts.





3)	Two infrastructure projects completed and turned-over to the Agency in CYs 2018 and 2019 totaling ₱73.48 million did not have the necessary occupancy permits. Further, the Learning Innovation and Entrepreneurship Building Phase 1 and 2 projects remained inoperative.



Section 2 of PD No. 1445 provides that “It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.” 



Audit and verification of transaction documents relative to infrastructure projects revealed that two projects implemented in CYs 2018 and 2019 were already completed and turned over to the agency.  However, despite completion, said projects remained idle and unutilized in CY 2020. Details of the two infrastructure projects are presented on the next page.

The non-utilization of these projects has deprived the intended beneficiaries of the immediate use thereof. Moreover, the inability of Management to cause the timely operation of the Learning Innovation and Entrepreneurship Building, Phase 1 and 2, deprived the College of the much-needed funds that could have been realized from the operation of the income generating project in the said building, with projected annual revenue of ₱2.67 million, computed as follows:

It was explained in the previous year’s Audit Report that the ETC II building will be in operation soon and that they were still waiting for the building occupancy permit. However, said occupancy permit is still not yet released as of this writing. 



Without the necessary occupancy permit from the building officials of the LGU, there is no assurance that the constructed buildings conform with the uniform building standards and requirements on building design.



The PPDMS Office is now coordinating with the contractors in securing occupancy permits. Succeeding infrastructure projects that will be completed by phase will be utilized immediately after its completion.



We recommended that Management comply with the following:



a)	Immediately secure or follow up the occupancy permits of the completed constructed building to ensure their conformity to safety and other standard requirements; and 



b)	Exert more effort to make the buildings available for its intended use and to enable the realization of revenues that may be used for the operations of the College.





10. The inability of the Agency to ensure completion of five infrastructure projects with total contract cost of ₱87.03 million manifests Management’s inefficiency in the monitoring and implementation thereof.



	Section 2 of PD No. 1445 states that, It is the declared policy of the state that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.



Audit of infrastructure projects of the Agency for CY 2020 revealed that almost all of the major projects that were supposed to be completed during the year were not yet finished as of year-end. These infrastructure projects are shown as follows:

₱87,031,660.57









Verification of related documents and inquiry with Management on the foregoing unfinished projects revealed the following:



1)	The first two projects were not yet completed after they were abandoned by the contractors. This is discussed in a separate audit finding in this report.

2)	The construction of Academic Building Phase 2 had incurred a total delay of 332 calendar days as of December 31, 2020. 

3)	The Construction of Motor pool and PPDMS Building and Construction of CAAT Building 2, Phase I, projects have been revised six and five times, respectively.



The non-completion of these projects on their original target dates deprived the Agency and other stakeholders, especially the students of the benefits that could have been derived from the timely completion thereof. This condition also manifests management’s inefficiency in the implementation of infrastructure projects. Moreover, this shortfall in achieving BISCAST’s capital outlay targets connotes the need to improve the agency’s planning and procurement processes to ensure that projects are executed efficiently. The principles of efficiency and economy in the procurement process must be observed at all times, consistent with the declared policy of the Government Procurement Reform Act.

 

According to Management, they are exerting efforts to ensure that the five infrastructure projects will be completed. A Construction Management team, composed of various Faculty Engineers from different fields, was created to help the PPDMS in closely monitoring and supervising the implementation of projects in accordance with the plans, specifications and timelines.



We recommended that Management:



a)	Exert more effort to ensure that the five infrastructure projects are completed so that the intended use thereof can be enjoyed by the beneficiaries of the projects; 



b)	Require the Project Engineers to monitor closely and supervise the project implementation in accordance with the plans, specifications and timelines, and institute appropriate penalties, where necessary, to protect the interest of the government; 



c)	Impose liquidated damages and other applicable sanctions against the contractors with delayed implementation of their projects, if warranted; and



d)	Require the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) and the Technical Working Group (TWG) to thoroughly and strictly review the post-qualification of contractors in terms of manpower, equipment requirements and performances on on-going and completed government and private civil works contracts. 





1)	Two contracts for infrastructure projects totaling ₱48.49 million that were not completed after they were abandoned by the contractors were not rescinded and the contractors’ performance securities were not forfeited, resulting in the overpayment representing the unrecouped advance payment to the contractor amounting to ₱4.54 million. 



	Section 8.4 of Annex E of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184 states that:



In case that the delay in the completion of the work exceeds a time duration equivalent to ten per cent (10%) of the specified contract time plus any time extension duly granted to the contractor, the procuring entity concerned may rescind the contract, forfeit the contractor’s performance security and take over the prosecution of the project or award the same to the qualified contractor through negotiated contract.



Section III, Item A (2) of Annex I of the same IRR, also provides that: 



The Procuring Entity shall terminate a contract for default when any of the following conditions attend its implementation:



a)	Due to the Contractor’s fault and while the project is ongoing, it has incurred a negative slippage of fifteen percent (15%) or more in accordance with Presidential Decree 1870;



b)	Due to Contractor’s fault and after the contract has expired, it has incurred a negative slippage of ten percent (10%) or more in the completion of the work; or



	During calendar year 2020, the State College awarded various infrastructure projects contracts thru public bidding for the construction and improvement of its facilities. However, two of these projects with a total contract cost of ₱48.50 million were not yet completed after they were abandoned by the contractors. These projects and other data thereof are as follows:

Verification and inquiry revealed that despite the inability of the contractors to perform their obligations and complete the projects, the auditee agency did not rescind the contracts as provided for by law. It was also disclosed that the performance securities in the form of surety bonds were not forfeited. Further verification also revealed that the Agency has not yet recouped all the 15 per cent advance payment granted to the contractors, which at the time of default, the amount recouped or recovered was only ₱2.13 million, computed as follows:

The inability of Management to rescind the contracts for the projects and awarding the same to other contractors, forfeit the performance bond and recoup the entire advance payment resulted in the following:



			1)	Deprived the agency and the intended beneficiaries of the use of the projects.

			2)	Advance or overpayment to the contractor representing the unrecouped advance payment amounting to ₱4.44 million.

			3)	Non-recovery of the performance security equivalent to 30 per cent of the contract amount from the insurance company.

			4)	Waste of government funds if the projects will not be completed.



According to Management, the project Completion of Learning Innovation and Entrepreneurship Building for AST is now the subject of a Special Civil action pending before the Regional Trial Court of Naga City, Branch 21.  In its latest Order, the court allowed the parties to explore the possibility of amicable settlement, and should there be no settlement reached, the hearing for the case will resume to adjudicate the issue on jurisdiction of the case.



Also, Management will initiate the termination of the contract for the Rehabilitation/Improvement of TEI Building and will enforce recovery of the performance security or warranty posted by the contractor from its Insurance Company. It will likewise send demand letter to the said contractor to recover the unrecouped advance payment.



	We recommended that Management take the following courses of action:

	

						a)	Immediately rescind the contract on the two projects and award the same to other qualified contractors and ensure that the projects are completed;



						b)	Recommend the blacklisting of the two contractors to the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB);



						c)	Enforce recovery of the performance security or warranty posted by the contractors from the Insurance Company where the surety bonds were obtained;



						d)	Apply all possible remedies in order to recover the unrecouped advance payment to the contractor; and



						e)	Institute other applicable sanctions against the contractors pursuant to existing regulations.





1)	Disbursements pertaining to procurement of goods thru the alternative modes of procurement totaling ₱6.36 million were not supported with complete documentation and were found to have deficiencies.



	Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 states that claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.



	COA Circular No. 2012 -001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribed the revised guidelines and documentary requirements for common government transactions including those for alternative modes of procurements. 



Section 48.1 of the revised IRR RA No. 9184 provides that Subject to the prior approval of HOPE, and whenever justified by the conditions provided in this Act, the Procuring Entity may, in order to promote economy and efficiency, resort to any of the alternative methods of procurement provided in this Rule. In all instances, the Procuring Entity shall ensure that the most advantageous price for the Government is obtained.



	Verification of the accounts as of November 30, 2020 disclosed that the agency purchased goods under the alternative mode of procurement, such as, Shopping and Small Value Procurements. Our audit revealed that the disbursements were not supported with all the required documents. The documents that were not submitted or not attached to the disbursement vouchers (DVs) are as follows:

Moreover, the audit of the related transactions also revealed other deficiencies as follows: 



a)	There were 24 instances where the mode of procurement stated on the BAC resolution, Purchase Orders and the Notice of Award posted in PhilGEPS were not the same. In one of the transactions under Check No. 9920101018 dated January 13, 2020 with DV No. 101-20-01-020, the amount stated in the BAC Resolution No. 316 s. 2019 of ₱14,000 was different from the amount stated in the bid proposal of ₱324,000; 



b)	Comparison of quotations from the suppliers revealed that the winning bidder does not reflect the lowest bid on every item purchased. The price of each item must also be evaluated together with the total price of all the items per supplier to establish the Lowest Calculated and Responsive Bidder. Buying goods/supplies in excess of the amount which may be acquired from other suppliers with cheaper value, deprives the agency of the amount that could be saved and eventually be used in other purchases;



c)	Some amounts written in the Abstract of Quotation do not properly reflect the prices per item provided by the suppliers in the Request for Quotation, hence, created doubts in the process of identifying the Lowest Calculated and Responsive Bidder;



d)	Name of affiant in the omnibus sworn statement is different from the name provided by the supplier in the list of authorized persons to sign, issue and execute the document. A difference in the name may indicate that the person who executed the document may not be properly authorized. It was also noted that several of the Omnibus Sworn Statements submitted by suppliers categorized as corporations do not include proof of the authorization such as duly notarized Secretary’s Certificate, Board Resolution or Special Power of Attorney (SPA). The proof must be attached by the supplier to properly identify the person attesting in the omnibus, thereby, supporting its legality.



The foregoing deficiency is contrary to Sec. 25.3(a) of Rev IRR of RA No. 9184 which provides that the signatory is the duly authorized representative of the prospective bidder, and granted full power and authority to do, execute and perform any and all acts necessary to participate, submit the bid, and to sign and execute the ensuing contract accompanied by the duly authorized Special Power of Attorney, Board/Partnership Resolution, or Secretary’s Certificate, whichever is applicable; Xxx;



e)	Five of the procurements through shopping were not supported with Certificate of Non-availability or any proof that the goods/supplies were not readily available from the Procurement Service of the Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM). The practice of purchasing common-use supplies and equipment shall be resorted to only when the stocks are not available from the PS-DBM in accordance with the following regulations:



1)	Section 4 of Administrative Order (AO) No. 17 dated July 28, 2011 which provides that Common-use supplies shall be procured directly from the PS or its depots without need of public bidding as provided in Section 53.5 of IRR of RA 9184.



2)	Section 20 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, which reiterated that all agencies of the government shall purchase its common-use supplies requirements from PS as mandated under Letter of Instruction (LOI) No. 755 dated October 18, 1978, EO No. 359, s. 1989, AO No. 17, s. 2011 and such other guidelines issued thereon.



f)	For the procurement of various office supplies and equipment paid under Check No. 2135182 dated February 10, 2020 and Purchase Order (PO) No. 19-22-0222, aside from having incomplete supporting documents, other documents submitted were not original copies, contrary to Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445; and



g)	There were two instances wherein the PO were not submitted within the prescribed period of five working days and one that was not received by the Auditor contrary to Section 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 which requires that a copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and every supporting document, shall, within five working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned.



	The foregoing deficiencies and the inability of Management to provide adequate documentation on the disbursements affected the integrity, validity and propriety of the transactions.



We recommended and Management agreed comply with the following:



a)	Submit all the supporting documents to avoid suspension of the procurement transactions in audit. Ensure that future disbursements for the procurement of goods are supported with complete documentation;



b)	For the Supply Officer and the BAC to exercise caution in preparing the pertinent supporting documents to ensure that information is properly and accurately presented; and



c)	Abide by the above-mentioned rules and regulations in the procurement process through alternative mode, especially in securing the certificate of non-availability of stocks from the PS-DBM under shopping as mode of procurement, to avoid sanctions thereof.

	

	

	13. Claims of contractors for various on-going and completed infrastructure projects were not supported with complete documentation. 

	

		Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 provides that “Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.”



Section 9.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2012 -001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribed the general guidelines and documentary requirements for transactions relative to procurement of infrastructure projects. 



Audit and verification of the pertinent transactions relative to claims by contractors for advance payments, progress billings and final payments for infrastructure contracts disclosed that some of the DVs evidencing the claims were not supported with complete documents. The infrastructure projects with lacking supporting documents and other noted deficiencies are summarized as follows: 



1)	For the Construction of Parking Barrier (1st progress billing 60 per cent accomplishment): 

	a)	Copy of Complete Technical Specifications

	b)	Copy of document containing the Detailed Breakdown of Approved Budget of the Contract (ABC) including the detailed breakdown of estimates and/or unit cost analysis/derivation of each work item expressed in volume/area/lump sum/lot.

	c)	Copy of approved PERT/CPM network diagram and detailed computations of contract time.

	d)	Copy of approved revised PERT/CPM Network Diagram and detailed computations of contract time with all previously issued time extension/suspension/Resumption Orders, if any

	e)	The Omnibus Sworn Statement was not strictly in accordance with PBB revised 2016 format on Page 90-91, since it did not include paragraph No. 9, stating that the bidder did not give directly or indirectly, any commissions, amount, fee or any form of consideration, pecuniary or otherwise, to the person or official personnel or representative of the government in relation to any procurement project or activity.

	f)	BAC Resolution No. 254, s. 2019 was not consistent with the description of the project in the other submitted documents since it includes Clearing of Dismantled Materials and wall fence demolition.

	g)	The BAC Resolution recommending the use of the Alternative Mode of Procurement was not authenticated and it has no date approved by the President.

	h)	Other audit observations noted:

1)	There was no concrete barrier installed in front of the AST building 

2)	Completed inspection was signed by one inspector only

3)	Not supported with letter from Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) and Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) requiring stoppage of the project

4)	The attached Work Resumption Order No. 1 dated May 20, 2020 was not received by the contractor



2)	Construction of Motor pool and PPDMS Building (15 per cent mobilization):



a)	The amount in the contract of ₱3.38 million is different from the amount in the bill of quantities of ₱3.49 million.

b)	The drawings/plans were not in standard size of 20 by 30 inches



3)	Construction of Center of Applied and Appropriate Technology (CAAT) Building 2, Phase 1(15 per cent  Mobilization)



a)	The Annual Procurement Plan (APP) was not authenticated

b)	In the Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid there is a discrepancy as to the duration of the project in figures and in words. In figures project duration is targeted for 165 calendar days whereas in words one sixty-five.

c)	For the Statement of the Bidder’s Single Largest Completed Contract (SLCC), there is no proof on the Contractor’s experience on Fire protection with sprinkler and roughing in piping’s.

d)	Certification of Detailed Engineering Survey was not submitted

	The absence of the above-enumerated supporting documents in the claims and other deficiencies noted in audit affected the vHenbcalidity and propriety of the transactions. 



Management through the Accounting Office, will submit the required supporting documents. They also committed to ensure complete documentation of claims for similar disbursements.



We recommended that Management comply with the following:



a)	Submit all the lacking supporting documents as well as written explanation on the noted deficiencies for audit verification and evaluation; and 



b)	Henceforth, ensure that all disbursements are properly supported with complete documentation to avoid possible suspension in audit.

	

	

1)	Various deficiencies were noted by the Regional Technical Services Office (RTSO) in the initial technical evaluation of the contract for the infrastructure project, Construction of Motor pool and PPDMS Building with a total contract cost of ₱3.38 million.



The contract for the infrastructure project Construction of Motor pool and PPDMS Building was subjected to technical review by the RTSO. The result thereof was communicated to the Audit Team through the Technical Evaluation Report for infrastructure projects dated November 10, 2020, copy of which is attached as Annex D. Per review and evaluation, the following documents are being required to be submitted in accordance with COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 Re: Prescribing the Revised Guidelines and Documentary Requirements for Common Government Transactions to wit:



1)	Written clarification/justification from the agency for the inconsistency of the quantities between the Detailed Breakdown of ABC, Detailed Breakdown of Contract Cost, Bill of Quantities, and Detailed Cost Estimates



2)	Detailed Breakdown of the estimates and/or quantity take-off.



	It was noted that Detailed Cost Estimate attached does not include the detailed quantity computations of the quantities shown in the ABC.



Furthermore, it was stipulated under DPWH Department Order (D.O.) No. 197 s. 2016 dated October 7, 2016 re: Revised Guidelines of the Preparation of the ABC that, “Since the ABC is to be computed with the Contractor’s Bid and is the ceiling for the acceptable Bid Price in accordance with the provisions of RA No. 9184, the ABC should be based on the approved Bidding Documents for the contract which contain the same work items and quantities as those to be used by the contractors in preparing their Bid.”



Management through the PPDMS Office will submit the required: (1) written clarification/justification on the inconsistency of the quantities between the Detailed Breakdown of ABC, Detailed Breakdown of Contract Cost, Bill of Quantities and Detailed Cost Estimates, and (2) detailed breakdown of the estimates and/or quantity take-off.

	

We recommended that Management submit the aforementioned required documents, clarifications, and justification. All documents that will be submitted shall be certified as exact copies of the original and as part of the contract.





15. Copies of Variation/Extra Work Order (EWO) and extension of contract time and their supporting documents for the five infrastructure projects totaling ₱85.24 million were not submitted to the Audit Team within five working days after its approval. 



The pertinent provisions applicable to this audit observation are provided in COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, as follows:



	Section 3.1.1 requires that the Auditor shall be furnished with a copy of the perfected contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference and incorporation within five working days from the execution of the contract. 



	Section 3.1.3 provides that “For technical review purposes, submission of contracts and   their supporting documents shall furthermore be guided by the specific documentary requirements outlined in the attached checklist marked as Annexes “A” to “T” of this circular.”



Section 3.1.7 states that “The procedures and timelines herein outlined shall also apply to supplementary contracts, variation orders and the like.” 



Also, Section 9.1.1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 enumerates the documentary requirements for Variation Order/Change Order/Extra Work Order.  



Since variation orders and extensions of contract time are integral part of the contract and therefore must be submitted to the Auditor within the prescribed five working days after their execution/approval. This will give the auditor ample time to review not only on the legal aspect of the contract but also to determine the reasonableness of the grounds for the grant of contract time extensions.



Review of the submitted Quarterly Report on Government Projects/Programs/Activities and audit of related disbursements revealed that the following infrastructure projects have extra work order/variation order and with extension of contract time:

Based on the table, only one project has an extra work order with corresponding time extension while the other four projects disclosed time extensions only.  However, copies of the variation orders and approved time extensions for all of the above projects and their supporting documents were not furnished the Audit Team.



	The PPDMS Director submitted to the Audit Team copy of the approved Extra Work Order, updated PERT/CPM, Detailed Cost Estimate and drawing for the project Completion of Learning Innovation and Entrepreneurship Building for AST but it was returned to the concerned official, through an indorsement dated September 23, 2020, due to inadequate supporting documents as required in Section 9.1.1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and Annex B of COA Circular No. 2009-001. However, the required supporting documents were no longer re-submitted by the PPDMS Office as of this writing. The following are the documents which remained unsubmitted per Annex B of COA Circular 2009-001:



a)	Copy of the of the approved original plans indicating the affected portion(s) of the project and duly approved revised plans and specifications, if applicable, indicating the changes made which shall be color coded.

b)	Copy of the agency’s report establishing the necessity/justification(s) for the need of such CO and /or EOW which shall include (a) the computation as to the quantities of the additional works involved per item indicating the specific stations where such works are needed, (b) the date of inspection was conducted and the results of such inspection, and (c) a detailed estimate of the unit cost of such items of work for new unit costs, including those expressed in volume/area/lump sum/lot

c)	Copy of approved PERT/CPM network diagram which shall be color coded, reflecting the effect of additional/deductive time on the contract period and the corresponding detailed computations for the additional/deductive time for the subject Change Order/Extra Work Order.

d)	Copy of the approved detailed breakdown of contract cost for the variation order.

e)	Copy of Notice to proceed indicating the date of receipt by the contractor

 

For the four other projects with revised/extension of completion date, evaluation thereof could not be conducted due to the non-submission of the following documents as provided in Annex E of the same Circular: 



1)	Copy of the approved time extension

2)	Copy of contractor’s request for time extension

3)	Copy of the approved contract

4)	Copy of Evaluation Report by the agency concerned establishing the need for time extension including the computation showing in sufficient detail how the number of days of extension was determined

5)	Certification or reports establishing the existence of the grounds for the contract time extension, as follows:



a)	PAGASA Report covering the area where the project is located, if extension requested is due to adverse weather conditions

b)	Provincial Commander’s Report, if the extension requested is due to deteriorating/worsening peace and order situation

c)	Certification from DOLE, DTI, DILG and /or DND, among others, whichever is applicable, for other grounds such as shortage of construction materials, general labor strike or similar activities that disrupted construction operations through no fault of the contractor.

6)	Copy of Notice to Proceed with date of receipt by the contractor/consultant

7)	Copy of approved original PERT/CPM Network Diagram and corresponding detailed computation of the contract time.

8)	Copy of approved original PERT/CPM Network Diagram reflecting the effect of the subject time extension on the original contract time and all previously issued Time extensions, Suspensions/Resumption Orders, and variation orders ( for infrastructure projects), if any.

9)	Xxx

10)	Terms of Reference

11)	Copy of the Approved Original and Revised (if any) Manning Schedule.

12)	If the original contract and/or any previously issued Time Extension and/or Variation Order (for infrastructure projects) with deductive/additive time have not yet been reviewed by COA, all requirements under Technical Evaluation of Infrastructure Contract Variation Checklist for each variation order/or time Extension must be submitted.



Post-audit of the final payment for the Construction of Parking Barrier and Signages in front of the AST Building revealed that a letter dated January 18, 2020 addressed to the contractor directing the latter to suspend the construction of parking barrier in front of the AST Building per recommendation by the 3rd District of DPWH as well as the Work Resumption Order No. 1 dated May 29, 2020 were not duly received by the contractor. Also, Work Suspension Order No. 1 dated January 18, 2020, was acknowledged by the contractor, however, the date of actual receipt was not indicated and was not supported with a certification from DILG, as required in Annex E item 5c, COA Circular No. 2009-001, among others, for other grounds or similar activities that disrupted construction operations through no fault of the contractor.  



	The non-submission of the above enumerated documents precluded the Audit Team from conducting timely auditorial review thereof and having the same referred to the RTSO for the evaluation of the technical aspects of the contracts. 



Management assured to comply with the recommendations in the ongoing and upcoming infrastructure projects. The PPDMS office, being the implementing unit of all infrastructure projects of the College, will ensure that they will be carefully planned and thoroughly reviewed and evaluated to minimize the likelihood of Variation Orders, Extra Work Orders and Time Extensions.





We recommended that Management take the following courses of action:



a)	Strictly comply with the prompt submission of copies of variation/extra work orders and approved time extensions together with the necessary supporting documents enumerated in Annexes B and E of COA Circular No. 2009-001; and



b)	Review and evaluate thoroughly the Program of Works (POW) to ensure that project designs and estimates are properly prepared and all phases of the projects are covered to minimize variation orders and time extensions which often results in increased cost and delayed project completion.





16. Payment of salary differential totaling ₱0.65 million for the months of January-March 2020 was not supported with Notice of Salary Adjustment (NOSA) and Notice of Salary Wage Adjustment (NSWA).



	Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 states that claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.



	DBM National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 579 dated January 24, 2020 was issued to implement the First Tranche of the Modified Salary Schedule for civilian personnel in the National Government pursuant to RA No. 11466. Item 11.1 thereof provides:



The Human Resource Management Officer (HRMO)/Administrative Officer (AO) of a national government agency (NGA) or GOCC shall prepare Notices of Salary Adjustment (NOSAs) for incumbent civilian personnel by following the format marked as Annex (“B-1”) of Annex (B-2”), whichever is applicable for approval by the Head of Agency.



For personnel whose actual salaries as of December 31, 2019 exceed the rates corresponding to Step 8 of the salary grade allocations of their positions in Annex “A”, the HRMO/AO shall no longer prepare NOSAs.



In the post audit of payment for salary differential, in connection with the implementation of the First Tranche of modified salary schedule, for the College personnel, we noted that the DVs were not properly accomplished and not supported with NOSA and NSWA. Details are as follows:

	The inability of Management to accomplish the DVs with complete information and not supported with the required documents cast doubt on the validity and propriety of the transactions. 



We recommended and Management agreed to require the HRMO thru the Accounting Unit to submit the required supporting documents to the Audit Team to avoid possible suspension thereof in audit. Ensure that future disbursements are supported with complete documentation and with properly accomplished DVs.





17. The salaries claimed by the College President since March, 2015 up to December 31, 2020 based on the approved appointments at the rate of Salary Grade (SG) 29 pertaining to a Professor VI which did not correspond to his position as President I with a SG of 27, were not supported with the necessary documentary requirements. 

	

Pursuant to the 1st Indorsement dated December 29, 2020 received by the audit team on January 14, 2021, an audit was conducted on the transactions of the agency particularly the salaries received by the President of the College since March 1, 2015 up to December 31, 2020 to ascertain the veracity of the complaint filed by BISCAST Faculty Alliance dated December 4, 2020. Allegedly, the College President had been receiving a salary higher than the authorized salary grade for the position of President I corresponding to salary grade 29 instead of salary grade 27.



Verification and analysis of the appointments and payrolls pertaining to the claims of the salaries of the President, showed that the rate in the appointment papers corresponded to a higher salary grade than the authorized rate for the position resulting in excessive claims of salaries totaling ₱1.83 million covering the period March 2015 to December 2020 (Annex E for the computation).



Further, it was observed that the excessive claims started in March 2015, when the School President claimed an adjustment of his salary. There was no appointment attached to the claim, but was supported with the Plantilla of Personnel and Salary Adjustment (PPSA) per National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 461 (6th CYCLE) 2010 Cut-off indicating among others, information as to the position title of SUC President I with salary grade 27 in the amount of ₱62,670 but with an Equivalent Academic Rank of Professor VI with a salary grade of 29 and a monthly rate of ₱73,099. Hence, it can be surmised based on the attached documents that the PPSA prepared by the HRMO II and approved by the College President was the basis for the salaries received for the period March 2015 up to December 2015.



For the period covering January 1, 2016 up to December 31, 2016, an adjustment of his salary was again recorded based on NBC No. 562. It also showed that the amounts claimed pertain to SG 29 instead of SG 27. No appointment or Notice of Salary Adjustment was attached to the claim for CY 2016. 



Similar increases were likewise registered during the years 2017 up to 2020 based on salary adjustments approved by the Department of Budget and Management. The audit also disclosed the same audit observations as in calendar years 2015 and 2016. During these years only one approved appointment by the President was obtained by the audit team. Said appointment which was prepared by the HRMO II, showed that the monthly rate for the position is equivalent to SG-29 amounting ₱106,454 while the position indicated thereof as SUC President I has a SG of 27. 



Although the salary increases based on the PPSA was approved by the DBM and the appointments were approved by Civil Service Commission (CSC) and CHED, granting of salaries higher than the authorized rates without legal basis constitutes irregularity and excessive expenditures and grant of unwarranted benefits to the College President.



In the reply to the AOM issued in this regard, it was explained that there was nothing irregular in the claims of SG 29 salary instead of the salary grade of 27 corresponding to the salary of President I, as this was allowed under National Budget Circular 461 and the same was approved by the DBM, CHED and Civil Service Commission.  The copy of the Management’s reply is attached as Annex F.



Further review of NBC 461 revealed that, contrary to the claims of the complainants that the College President was not covered in said Circular, it was disclosed that pursuant to Section 4 of the Circular, SUC Presidents and Vice Presidents are also covered thereof. The pertinent provision of NBC No. 461 is quoted as follows:



4.1.2. SUC Presidents and Vice-Presidents who opt to receive the basic salary pertaining to their assigned academic rank under the CCE, provided that they have complied with the requirements mentioned under Section 3.0 hereof and those who opt to return to the academe due to their resignation/retirement not for cause before the expiration of their fixed terms of office.



However, the Audit Team gathered that the College President was an Associate Professor V when he was appointed as SUC President 1 in calendar year 2013. Thus, it was the first time that he was applying for the position as Professor VI, which has a salary grade of 29. Perusal of NBC 461 revealed that pursuant to Item V-1.5 of the Implementing Guidelines of NCC No. 69, it provides that for candidates entering the rank of Professor for the first time, they shall be subject to accreditation by a committee of experts duly constituted by the Philippine Association of State Universities and Colleges (PASUC). Verification of the supporting documents of the claims for the salary of the College President from 2015 up to 2020 disclosed that no documentary evidence of accreditation was submitted or attached to the claims. Moreover, the complainants also alleged that the salary adjustment of the respondent was subject to confirmation by the Board of Trustees (BOT) of the school. No supporting document relative to this was submitted to the audit team. 



In the absence of proof of compliance of the foregoing requirements, we maintain our position that the College President’s claims of salary with SG 29 is unauthorized, thereby resulting to excess claims of salaries from March, 2015 up to December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱1.83 million.



We recommended that Management submit the following documents to the Audit Team for verification, otherwise, a refund of the excess claims be made by the College President:



a)	Memorandum/Certificate issued by the PASUC that the College President has been accredited as Professor VI by a committee of experts constituted by PASUC; and



b)	Confirmation by the Board of Trustees of the salary adjustment to Salary Grade 29.





18. Personnel benefits such as the Mid-Year and Year End Bonuses, and Cash Gift for CY 2020 amounting to ₱5.56 million, ₱5.82 million and ₱838,500, respectively, were granted to employees of the College in advance. 



	Sections 57 and 58 of the General Provisions of RA 11465, or the GAA for CY 2020, provides among others that the Mid/Year Bonus and cash gift shall be granted subject to the provisions of BC No. 2017-2 dated May 8, 2017 and BC No. 2016-4 dated April 28, 2016, respectively, and such other guidelines issued by the DBM. 



	Item 5.1 of DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 2017-2 dated May 8, 2017 provides that The Mid-Year Bonus equivalent to one (1) month basic pay as of May 15 shall be given to entitled personnel not earlier than May 15, of the current year xxx.



	Item 6.0 of DBM BC No. 2016-4 dated April 28, 2016 provides that The Year End bonus equivalent to one (1) month basic pay as of October 31 and cash gift of ₱5,000.00 shall be given to entitled government personnel not earlier than November 15, of the current year xxx.



	Review of the payment for the Mid-Year and Year End bonuses, and cash gift of the College officials and employees revealed that the grants thereof were not in accordance with regulations issued by the DBM. Details are shown on the next page.

We recommended and Management agreed to stop the granting of the Mid-Year and Year-End Bonus and Cash gift to employees in advance and strictly follow the rules and regulations stipulated in the above mentioned DBM issuances to ensure authorized and regular disbursement of public funds.





19. Monetary PRAISE incentive totaling ₱5.19 million granted to 173 employees and some retirees was not supported with necessary documents.



	CSC MC No. 01, s. 2001 is the revised policies on Program on Awards and Incentives for Service Excellence (PRAISE). Item 6 thereof states the following:



xxx



6.	The PRAISE shall provide both monetary and non-monetary awards and incentives to recognize, acknowledge and reward productive, creative, innovative and ethical behavior of employees through formal and informal mode.

For this purpose, the System shall encourage the grant of non-monetary awards. Monetary awards shall be granted only when the suggestions, inventions, superior accomplishments and other personal efforts result in monetary savings which shall not exceed 20% of the savings generated.  (Underscoring ours)

i)	Incentives to reward an employee’s loyalty to government service and contributions to the agency’s continuing viable existence, as follows:



(aa)	 Loyalty Incentive;

However, post audit of the aforementioned disbursements revealed that there were no supporting documents attached to the paid DVs, such as, guidelines and procedures for nomination, screening and evaluation and such other documents deemed necessary to show that there were acceptable exemplary achievements which resulted in monetary savings that made the personnel of the College eligible to receive said incentive, as only the following documents were attached to the DVs:

Likewise, erroneous charging of the PRAISE incentive was committed by the Management when the fund used was from the Internally Generated Fund of the College, contrary also to Item 6 of CSC MC 01 s. 2001 which provides that not exceeding 20 per cent of the monetary savings generated from suggestions, inventions, superior accomplishments and other personal efforts, will be granted as the monetary award. 



`The grant of the aforesaid PRAISE incentive constitutes a new incentive to the College personnel which requires approval by the President upon recommendation of the DBM as required under Section 5 of PD 1597 as the said incentive was not among the allowable incentives under Item 4(h) of Joint Resolution No. 4 s. 2009.

	

According to Management, payment of PRAISE incentive was based on the BISCAST PRAISE Manual that was duly approved by the BOT and by the CSC.  The PRAISE Incentive was a one-time across the board incentive granted to BISCAST personnel in recognition of their collective effort in the passing of ISO Certification and Annual Surveillance Audits. The PRAISE Incentive is being paid out of the Human Resource Development (HRD) Funds allocated by the College.



The Audit Team maintains its stand that the monetary incentive granted to officials and employees was not in accordance with Item 6 of CSC MC No. 01 s. 2001 as there were no documents submitted showing that the suggestions, inventions, superior accomplishments and other personnel efforts have resulted to monetary savings.



Although the PRAISE was categorized as incentive component of the Total Compensation Framework under Section 9 of RA No. 11466, which took effect on January 1, 2020, the CSC has not yet issued the required implementing guidelines on the monetary and/or non-monetary rewards for recognition of personnel under the PRAISE, thus, the existing guidelines on the grant of monetary award under CSC MC No. 01 s. 2001 still prevail. The specific provision of Section 9 of RA No. 11466 is quoted hereunder:



 The PRAISE instituted by the Civil Service Commission (CSC) pursuant to the provisions of Executive Order No. 292 (Administrative Code of 1987) stipulating the establishment of an employee suggestions and incentive component of the Total Compensation Framework. The guidelines on the monetary and/or non-monetary rewards for recognition of personnel under the PRAISE shall be issued by the CSC in consultation with the DBM.



We recommended that Management comply with the following courses of action:



			a)	Submit documents to show that there were acceptable exemplary achievements which resulted in monetary savings that made the personnel of the College eligible to receive said incentive; 



			b)	Proof that there were available savings from Personnel Services of the General Appropriations Act in FY 2020; and



			c)	Refrain from granting allowances, benefits and incentives without legal basis to avoid possible disallowance in audit.





20. Motor Vehicle and Other Transportation Equipment owned by the College valued in the books at ₱13.65 million were not kept in a garage for proper safekeeping and were not marked with “For Official Use Only”.



Sections V(2) and 5.5 of COA Circular No. 75-6 dated November 7, 1975 provide the regulations in the proper use of government vehicles, stated as follows:



	 (2) Marking “For Official Use Only” –



“All motor vehicles owned by the National Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, and all local government units including government-owned or controlled corporations, except those used by the officials enumerated under No.  I hereof, should be plainly marked:



FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (3 inches)



under which should be written the corresponding name of the bureau, office, corporation, provincial, city, municipality, or other local government unit operating or using the name.



The mark should appear on each side of the motor vehicle. When there is no sufficient space on each side, the same should appear at the back and on the front just below the windshield of the motor vehicle. (General Circular No. 59, dated November 20, 1958).



	 (5) Keeping in Government Garages –



All government motor vehicles are required, when not in use, to be kept in the garage provided thereof by the bureau or office or entity to which they belong except when in use for strictly official business outside office hours. (Section 13, P.D. 733).”



The same provisions were restated in no. 2 of the Specific Rules and Regulations of COA Circular No. 77-61 dated September 26, 1977, enumerating therein the instructions on how the government vehicles must be properly controlled and regulated.

	

Verification of records disclosed that for CY 2020, the College owned nine motor vehicles and other transportation equipment valued in the books at ₱13.65 million. One of these vehicles has already been disposed but not yet dropped from the books, two are being used as instructional materials and the remaining six are being utilized as school service. 



Ocular inspection conducted within the campus on March 2, 2021 revealed that the vehicles used for operations were not properly secured and were just parked in open spaces, exposed to natural elements that would eventually contribute to the early deterioration of these assets. In fact, two vehicles were parked near a construction site and another two in an open parking space without any cover while some were parked inside the Automotive Technology Room (ATR). 



It was observed that while the ATR may provide enough space to accommodate the school vehicles, three private cars and the vehicles that are used as instructional materials were already parked within the premises. 



Since the garage for the school vehicles is still under construction and cannot be used for the time being, the Management should prioritize the protection and preservation of the government vehicles by accommodating/parking them inside the Automotive Technology room so as to avoid undue deterioration and eventually shorten their lifespan and usefulness. If not properly addressed, this may result in possible loss and wastage of government properties.



	This observation is a reiteration of the previous year’s audit finding which has yet to be favorably acted upon.



	It was also observed that school vehicles were not properly marked with “For Official Use Only” but bears only the logo of the College, not in conformance with the above stated regulations.

	Moreover, two vehicles found inside the ATR which are being used as instructional vehicles were neither recorded in the RPCPPE nor booked up or disclosed in the Notes to Financial Statements, thereby, understating the PPE account in the FS. According to the personnel of the College, these vehicles were donated to the school.



Management commented that the College has an ongoing construction of the Motor pool and once completed, the service vehicles will be parked therein for safekeeping when not in use. Pending the construction, a designated place is now being utilized as temporary parking area.  Finally, Management will comply with provisions of COA Circular Nos. 75-6 and 77-61 on the proper markings of the government vehicles.



We reiterated the following previous year’s audit recommendations:



a)	For Management to provide a secure place or a cover for vehicles that can shield them from the harsh weather conditions and the elements of deterioration. Also, provide a designated area as a parking space for the government vehicles being used regularly for ease access;



b)	For the Accountant and the Property Officer to facilitate the recording of the donated vehicles by securing necessary documents from the donor; and



c)	All government vehicles owned by the College be properly marked with “For Official Use Only” and the name/logo of the agency pursuant to COA Circular Nos. 75-6 and 77-61.





21. The dates indicated in the Inspection and Acceptance Reports (IAR) submitted to the Audit Team for some deliveries of consumable goods were way beyond the dates of actual meetings and activities conducted.



Appendix 62 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, prescribes the format for the IAR to be used by NGAs and to be accomplished as follows: 



A)	The IAR is a report submitted by the Inspection Officer/Committee and Supply and /or Property Custodian on the inspection and acceptance, respectively, of the purchased supplies/goods/ equipment/property.



B)	Xxx



C)	The inspection Officer/Committee shall sign, specify the date of inspection, and put a check “√” mark the “Inspection” portion of the IAR, indicating that he/she has inspected, verified and found in order the items delivered as to quantity and specifications.



D)	The Supply and/or Property Custodian shall acknowledge receipt of the items by indicating in the “Acceptance” portion of the IAR, his/her name, signature, date of acceptance, and a check “√” mark whether the delivery is complete or partial as to quantity (specify quantity received, if partial)

Item A(2) of COA Circular No. 96-010 dated August 15, 1996 provides that The agency official responsible for accepting deliveries of procured items shall, within twenty-four (24) hours from such acceptance, notify the Auditor of the time and date of the scheduled deliveries (COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995). In case of partial delivery of any item in the P.O., the copy to be submitted shall indicate which items have been delivered, and which have not.



The staff of the Supply Office was able to submit the IAR to the Audit Team within 24 hours after acceptance and inspection per dates indicated therein. However, in the review of the submitted IARs it was noted that the designated inspector was unable to conduct timely inspection of consumable and perishable goods, such as, meals delivered during meetings and other activities of the College. Based on the dates indicated in the submitted 34 IARs, the inspection and acceptance were conducted 1-193 days after the meals were supposedly served and consumed, thus, said reports do not actually provide reliable information which cast doubt on the regularity and propriety of the transactions. There was no assurance that actual delivery had been made as actual validation can no longer be made by the Auditor. 



	The Designated Inspector informed the Audit Team that the concerned employee of the Supply Office just dictated to her the date that should be indicated in the IAR. Actual inspection on some deliveries of goods like foods served during meetings, could no longer be conducted because she was not informed to do the inspection on the actual day of the activity. Please refer to Annex G for the details.



Management assured the Audit Team of their compliance to the recommendations. The Supply Office will immediately notify the Designated Inspection Officers on the receipt of deliveries of goods and give them copy of the PO as reference for inspection. The designated Inspection Officers will inspect the deliveries of goods on the actual dates of deliveries and indicate such inspection on the IAR.	



We recommended that Management instruct the Supply/Property Officer to immediately notify the designated inspector of the receipt of deliveries of goods so that actual inspection can be conducted by the latter to avoid doubt on the correctness and regularity of the data in the IAR. A copy of the PO shall be provided as reference in the conduct of inspection. Stop the practice of accomplishing the IAR, for the sake of complying with the regulation and upon request of the Supply Office, if no actual inspection is conducted to avoid collusion on any irregular activities.





A)	COMPLIANCE WITH GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT (GAD)



	22. Inability of the Agency to perform gender analysis affected the maintenance and effectiveness of GAD Database. 



	Section 3.4 of Philippine Commission on Women (PCW)/National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)/DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides that: Xxx. To aid gender mainstreaming, agencies shall perform gender analysis using existing tools, such as Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG), to ensure that the different concerns of women and men are addressed equally and equitably in their PAPs. Activities to address these differential concerns through capacity development on GAD or GAD-focused activities shall be included in agency GPBs.

	

Further, Section 36(c) of RA No. 9710 provides that: Generation and Maintenance of GAD Database. All departments, including their attached agencies, offices, bureaus-state universities and colleges, government-owned and controlled corporations, local government units, and other government instrumentalities shall develop and maintain a GAD database containing gender statistics and sex disaggregated data that have been systematically gathered, regularly updated, and subjected to gender analysis for planning, programming, and policy formulation.



Interview with the GAD Focal Person disclosed that the process of gathering/updating of data on gender analysis was not done accordingly due to COVID 19 pandemic. Conducting gender analysis, especially in these times, would help in identifying current concerns, issues and problems that should be addressed to by the agency. It was also noted that the information on sex disaggregated data for students and employees was not readily available nor filed by the concerned official. We were informed that the data for the students and employees were in the custody of the Registrar and the Human Resource Development Office (HRDO), respectively. However, copy thereof was not requested from said offices by the Focal Person for their needed information and use.



The gender analysis and sex disaggregated data are information necessary to conduct a proper gender mainstreaming and aids in the establishment of the GAD programs, projects and activities (PPAs). The absence of which may indicate that the underlying gender issues have not been properly identified and addressed by the agency.



In the review and evaluation of the GAD activities indicated in the Annual GAD Plan and Budget for the year 2020 it showed that many PPAs could have been accomplished to address the gender issues/GAD mandate of the agency. However, due to lack of personnel to assist the designated GAD focal person resulted to a less desired outcome of identified PPAs attributed to GAD.



	As provided under Section 3.5 of PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2011-01, the GAD Focal Point System is an interacting and interdependent group of people in all government instrumentalities tasked to catalyze and accelerate gender mainstreaming. It is a mechanism established to ensure and advocate for, guide, coordinate, and monitor the development, implementation, review and updating of their GAD plans and GAD-related programs, activities and projects (PPAs).



Management will ensure compliance of the COA recommendations. The new GAD Focal Person was duly informed of the abovementioned audit observation and advised to submit its report of the compliance to the recommendations.



We recommended that Management:



a)	Direct the GAD Focal Person to maintain a copy of the sex disaggregated data gathered by other departments and undertake gender analysis for proper identification of existing gender issues to ensure that the PPAs are responsive to the said issues; and



b)	Provide an additional personnel to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of GAD Focal Point System (GFPS).





1)	The GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) did not reflect the changes in the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) due to COVID-19 pandemic. 



Section 4.5 of PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2020-03 dated April 27, 2020 provides that: Agencies, whether with an endorsed or unendorsed GPB, shall reflect all changes made in the original FY 2020 GPB (e.g., cancellation/postponement of a GAD activity due to the Enhanced Community Quarantine or implementation of a new GAD activity to respond to the COVID-19 situation) in their GAD Accomplishment Report (GAD AR). Agencies shall also fill-out Column 10 of the GAD AR form to indicate deviations from the identified GAD activities and targets, if applicable.

	

	The PCW GMMS portal is not yet open for encoding the 2020 Accomplishment Report, hence, we requested a copy of the prepared report that will be eventually encoded in the portal was requested. Upon review thereof, however, it was noticed that the GAD AR did not include the information on changes made on the 2020 GPB resulting in the difficulty in comparing the reports. As the COVID-19 pandemic greatly affects the PPAs of the agency, the GAD AR should reflect any deviation from the targets set in GPB.



The GAD AR was already submitted to CHED Regional Office. The newly designated focal person was already advised through a memo to reflect in the GAD AR the changes in the GAD Plan and Budget due to Covid 19 pandemic.



	We recommended that Management require the GAD Focal Person to prepare and submit the GAD AR in accordance with the adjustments set under PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2020-03 as this will be the report to be encoded in the PCW GMMS portal.





B)	Compliance With Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth



24. Remittances of contribution/repayments to GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth were not reconciled with the amounts withheld resulting in unremitted/unreconciled amounts of ₱0.99 million, ₱0.61 million and ₱32,090, respectively.



		Section 14 of the revised IRR of RA No. 8291 or Government Service Insurance Act of 1997 provides that Each government agency shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and government agency’s contributions within the first 10 days of the calendar month following the month to which the contributions apply.  The remittance by the government agency of the contributions to the GSIS shall take priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except salaries and wages of its employees.

			

		Also, Section 3(a) of RA No. 9679 or Home Development Mutual Fund Law of 2009 requires that All employers shall remit to the fund their contributions and the contributions of their covered employees as well as the latter’s loan amortizations or payments to the fund within 15 days from the date the same were collected unless another period is previously agreed between the employer and the Fund, or within such periods as the fund may prescribe otherwise the date the contributions fall due until paid.

			

				Further, Section 5.1, Rule No. III of the IRR of RA No. 7875 or the National Health Insurance Act of 2013 states that:



a)	The member’s monthly contribution shall be deducted and withheld automatically by the employer from the former’s salary wage or earnings. The premium contributed shall be divided equally between the employer and the employed. The employer’s counterpart shall not in any manner be charged to the employee;

b)	The monthly premium contribution of employed members shall be remitted by the employer on or before the date prescribed by the corporation; and

c)	The remittance of premium contribution by the employer shall be supported by a Remittance List to be submitted regularly to the Corporation.

				

Audit of the Inter-Agency Payables accounts showed that the College was not able to comply with the requirements of the above-mentioned regulations. Our verification revealed that funds withheld that are due to the GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth, were not remitted intact by the agency, resulting to significant unremitted balances. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balances of the accounts Due to GSIS (Fund 101 and 164), Due to Pag-IBIG (Fund 101 and 164) and Due to PhilHealth (Fund 101) amounted to ₱0.99 million, ₱0.61 million and ₱32,090, respectively. Further analysis showed that the unremitted balances include contributions pertaining to prior years. The summary is shown in the table below.

	As can be gleaned from the table above, the College was not able to remit the total amount of ₱1.64 million contributions and loan amortizations to GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth as of December 31, 2020. Analysis of the outstanding balances showed that they are part of the prior year’s balances which remained unremitted although a significant decrease was noted.

	

The unremitted/unreconciled beginning balances in the total amount of ₱2.78 million were already observed and communicated in the prior years’ audits. However, no reconciliation was done yet by the Accounting personnel to establish the correct balances. Also, subsidiary ledgers were not maintained for the Trust Liability accounts, hence, the names of employees with unremitted premiums and contributions cannot be immediately established. 



None or delayed remittance of deductions to these agencies will result in interest payments and penalties which should be a personal liability of the officer or employee who caused the delay. This is also detrimental to the member-employees of the college since they will be deprived of the benefits that they should be entitled to and could have enjoyed during their employment until retirement. Likewise, non-reconciliation of the Due to GSIS, PhilHealth and HDMF accounts as to the over/under recording of remittances renders the accuracy of the balances of the affected accounts doubtful. 



Management averred that the Accounting Office will conduct a detailed review on the transactions affecting the Inter-Agency Payables to ascertain the correctness of the balances.  A reconciliation of the College’s records with that of the GSIS, HDMF and PhilHealth to arrive at the correct/reliable balance will be given priority this CY 2021. The necessary adjusting entries shall likewise be effected in the books.



We reiterated our recommendations that Management: 



a)	Require the Accountant to conduct a detailed review on the transactions affecting the Inter-Agency Payables to ascertain the correctness of the balances;



b)	Instruct the Accountant to prioritize the reconciliation of the agency’s records with that of the GSIS, HDMF and PhilHealth to arrive at correct/reliable balances and effect the necessary adjustments in the books, if any; and 



c)	Give the highest priority on the immediate remittance to the concerned agencies of the unremitted balances. Henceforth, ensure that future collections are remitted promptly and intact to avoid penalties that maybe imposed by the said agencies for late remittance.
