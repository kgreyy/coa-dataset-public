EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
Introduction 
 
The Forest Products Research and Development Institute (FPRDI) is a line agency 
under the umbrella of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) aimed to 
address the changing need of the forest-based industries. It was situated in the campus 
of the University of the Philippines Los Baños - College of Forestry and Natural 
Resources (UPLB-CFNR). 
 
It was created in 1954 as the Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) under the then Bureau 
of Forestry. In 1957, the FPL was restructured by virtue of Executive Order (EO) No. 257 
into Forest Products Research Institute (FPRI) and was attached to UPLB for 
administrative purposes. The FPRI was again reorganized in 1969 into Forest Products 
Research and Industries Development Commission (FORPRIDECOM) and was put 
under the then National Science Development Board (NSDB). 
 
The NSDB was reconstituted into the National Science and Technology Authority 
(NSTA) and the FORPRIDECOM was reorganized into FPRDI, still under the NSTA 
through EO No. 784 in 1982. In 1987, the NSTA was reorganized into the DOST through 
EO No. 128, and the FPRDI has remained under it, retaining its present name with 
modified organizational structure. 
 
The FPRDI is mandated to conduct research and development (R&D) on wood and non-
wood forest products, transfer technologies and provide technical services and training. 
 
The following are the Vision and Mission of the FPRDI: 
 
Vision 
 
A renowned leader and center of excellence in forest products utilization research, 
development and technology transfer. 

 
Mission

Scope of Audit 
 
The audit covered the review of the accounts and operations for CY 2020.  The audit 
was conducted to: (a) verify the levels of assurance that may be placed on 
Management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) recommend agency 
improvement opportunities; and (c) determine the extent of implementation of prior 
year’s audit recommendations. 
 
 
Audit Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the 
financial statements of the FPRDI for CY 2020 due to the effects in the financial 
statements of the following deficiencies noted: 
 
1. The Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account’s balance as of December 31, 

2020, of P591,502,294.47 (gross) is of doubtful validity and reliability due to the:  
(a) net difference of P168,087,319.38 between the General Ledger’s balance and 
that of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment 
(RPCPPE); and  (b) non-disposal of unserviceable PPE items amounting to 
P2,088,294.72, inconsistent with Section 38, Chapter 10 of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I 
and the Handbook on Property and Supply Management System, thus affecting the 
fair presentation of the PPE and other related accounts in the financial statements. 

 
2. The non-reclassification of the cost of the completed project and non-recording of 

the ongoing infrastructure project resulted in net understatement of P123,157.65 in 
the Construction in Progress (CIP) account amounting to P900,720.02 in the 
Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020, contrary to Section 8.g, 
Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 



iv 

 

3. The Due to NGAs account as of December 31, 2020, amounting to P3,106,903.62 
remained unrefunded and/or unliquidated despite completion of the projects due to 
the absence of available records, and is still subject for reconciliation, contrary to 
Sections 6.5 and 6.7 of Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 94-013 dated 
December 13, 1994, thus exposed the said unrefunded funds to possible 
misappropriation or misapplication.  

 
4. The absence of proper monitoring and reconciliation of the subsidiary accounts of 

Due to Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) account is contrary to Sections 123 and 
124 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445. This has resulted in unreconciled 
balance of P615,178.56 and abnormal negative balances of 60 subsidiary ledger 
(SL) accounts amounting to P65,889.11. Thus, affecting the fair presentation of the 
said accounts in the financial statements.  

 
 
Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 
For the exceptions cited above, the Audit Team has recommended that the FPRDI 
Director: 
 
1. a)  direct (a) all of the concerned Divisions to prepare list of existing PPE per office 

under their custody for submission to, and verification of the Property Section prior 
to the conduct of actual inventory by the Inventory Committee; (b) the Property 
Section to update its records based on the results of the initial inventory, and 
coordinate with the Accounting Section to reconcile the Property Cards with the 
PPE Ledger Cards (PPELCs); (c) the Accounting Section to take-up necessary 
journal entries to recognize PPEs found at station and prepare/maintain the 
corresponding PPELCs; (d) the Inventory Committee to: conduct physical count of 
all the PPE, whether acquired through purchase or donation, and prepare and 
submit the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment 
(RPCPPE), in compliance with Section 38, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume 
I; ensure that full reconciliation of the inventory count documented in RPCPPE with 
the records maintained by the Accounting Section is properly made to establish the 
correct balance of PPE, and strictly comply with the guidelines and procedures on 
inventory-taking, recognition of those found at station and disposition for non-
existing/missing PPE items for the one-time cleansing of PPE accounts of the 
FPRDI, in accordance with COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020; 
and (e) the Property and Accounting Sections to perform periodic reconciliation of 
their records to ensure that all discrepancies are immediately investigated, cleared 
and reconciled.  

 
b) (a) create a Disposal Committee and instruct the same to dispose unserviceable 
properties, pursuant to Section 79 of PD No. 1445, in order to avoid further 
deterioration, thus enabling the FPRDI to have better chance of recovery of its 
residual values; (b) require the Property Officer to prepare the prescribed Inventory 
and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) as basis of dropping from 
the books, the said unserviceable properties carried in the PPE accounts, pursuant 
to Section 40(d), Chapter 10 and Appendix 74 of GAM for NGAs, Volumes I and II, 
respectively; and (c) instruct the concerned employee to submit the IIRUP to the 
Accountant upon completion of the disposal activity, and ensure that the original 



v 

 

copy of the report will be the basis in the proper adjustment of the balance of 
affected PPE accounts through a duly approved Journal Entry Voucher (JEV). 

 
2. direct the Accountant to: (a) prepare the JEV to adjust for the understatement/ 

(overstatement) in the CIP account duly supported with the necessary 
documentations, and submit the same to the Audit Team for verification; (b) ensure 
that all ongoing infrastructure projects are properly recorded under the appropriate 
CIP account, and duly reconciled with the records of the Project Engineer to reflect 
in the financial statements the infrastructure projects of the FPRDI which are still 
ongoing construction; and (c) require the Project Engineer to submit his report on 
or before the 5

th
 day after the end of the quarter. 

 
3. instruct the Accountant to: (a) locate the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)/Trust 

Agreements with the source agencies and Financial/Terminal Reports to determine 
the detail and nature of the accounts to settle the balance of P2,811,486.02;        
(b) review prior years’ transactions and perform reconciliation, in coordination with 
the Program/Project Leader, to fully liquidate the completed projects with remaining 
balance of P295,417.60, and effect the necessary adjustments to settle the 
balance, if warranted; and (c) record in the books of accounts the liquidations 
submitted by the Program/Project Leader, submit the Financial/Terminal Reports 
and refund the excess project funds to the source/funding agencies, immediately 
after the completion of the project, in compliance with Sections 6.5 and 6.7 of COA 
Circular No. 94-013. 

 
4. direct the Accountant to: (a) trace prior years’ accounting entries to ascertain the 

cause of abnormal negative balances; (b) review and analyze records pertaining to 
the unreconciled balances in the SLs of the Due to BIR account; and                    
(c) immediately adjust the unreconciled and abnormal account balances to correct 
and update SL balances, and/or refund over remittances, if there are any. 

 
The deficiencies noted in the course of audit were earlier communicated through Audit 
Observation Memoranda (AOMs) and presented in Audit Highlights on June 4, 2021, 
with the concerned officials. 
 
The other significant observations in the course of the audit and the recommended 
corrective measures are shown below: 
 
1. The non-submission of JEVs, together with their supporting documents is contrary to 

the provision of Appendix 36 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II and Section 7.2.1 of the 
Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) prescribed under COA 
Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009.  This also hindered the Audit Team 
in verification of the recorded transactions of FPRDI. 

 
We recommended that the Director instruct the Accountant to prepare and submit 
the JEVs, including their supporting documents, within the first 10 days of ensuing 
month. Also, submit immediately to the Audit Team the JEVs for transactions in CY 
2020, particularly the non-cash transactions and manual adjustments made, to 
facilitate verification in determining the correctness of the amount recorded. 

 
2. The delayed submission of disbursement vouchers, trial balances, financial 

statements and supporting schedules precluded the prompt audit of accounts and 



vi 

 

financial transactions, early detection and correction of errors/deficiencies and 
timely reporting of the audit results to Management, in contravention with Section 
122(2) of PD No. 1445, Section 7.2.1 of the RRSA as prescribed under COA 
Circular No. 2009-006 and Section 60, Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 
We recommended that Management direct the Chief Administrative Officer and the 
Accountant in ensuring that all DVs and financial reports are submitted to the 
Auditor within the prescribed period to facilitate timely audit of the accounts and 
transactions of the FPRDI, pursuant to Section 7.2.1 of the RRSA prescribed under 
COA Circular No. 2009-006 and Section 60, Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume 
I. Otherwise, initiate appropriate action against the concerned personnel in 
accordance with Section 122(2) of PD No. 1445, if warranted. 

 
3. The FPRDI did not provide a complete list of all its ongoing projects and those that 

are to be implemented during the year at the prescribed time specified under Item 
2.1 of COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 2013. Likewise, it did not 
submit to the Auditor the copies of contracts and supporting documents on the 
seven procurement projects with total contract amount of P20,329,050.43, within 
five working days from execution thereof, contrary to Item 3.1.1 of COA Circular 
No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, thus precluded the Auditor in conducting 
timely review of the procurement activities. 

 
We recommended that the Director: (a) direct the concerned officials to prepare the 
complete list of all ongoing projects, programs and activities (PPAs) and those that 
are to be implemented during the year, for audit validation and verification; and    
(b) instruct the FPRDI Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) to provide valid 
explanations on non-submission of the contracts and supporting documents 
pertaining to the above projects. 
 
We further recommended that henceforth, the guidelines prescribed in COA 
Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, on the submission of contracts 
and supporting documents within five working days from the execution of a 
contract/purchase order be strictly complied by the BAC Secretariat. 

 
4. The non-compliance with pertinent rules and regulations in the recording, 

maintenance and utilization of Petty Cash Fund (PCF) granted to an Accountable 
Officer amounting to P30,000.00 has exposed the fund to the risk of loss and 
mishandling, and is contrary to Sections 35 and 36, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, 
Volume I. Moreover, expenses made out of the PCF amounting to P27,718.12 
under List of Due and Demandable Accounts Payable-Advice to Debit Accounts 
(LDDAP-ADA) No. 101-101-04-106-2020 were not supported with adequate 
documentary requirements, contrary to Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 and Section 
1.2.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001. 

 
We recommended that Management: (a) direct the Accountant to record in the 
books the accountability of the PCF Custodian under Petty Cash Fund, in 
accordance with the Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) of  GAM for 
NGAs; (b) reassess the accurate amount of PCF and prepare a duly approved 
estimates of petty expenses to be incurred for one month, and establish policies 
concerning the use of PCF, in compliance with Section 36, Chapter 6 of GAM for 
NGAs, Volume I; (c) require the PCF Custodian to strictly adhere to the existing 



vii 

 

government rules, regulations and policies on the handling of the PCF subject to 
the proper use and liquidation of the fund, and properly accomplish the Petty Cash 
Voucher and Petty Cash Fund Record in accordance with Appendices 48 and 50 of 
GAM for NGAs, Volume II, and replenish the PCF once the disbursements reached 
75 percent; (d) instruct the PCF Custodian and the Accountant to refrain from 
charging regular expenses, pursuant to Section 35, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, 
Volume I and COA Circular No. 2012-001, and identify expenses that should be 
paid through checks; (e) direct the PCF Custodian to ensure that the claims are 
supported with complete information/detail and the liquidations are supported with 
complete documentations; and (f) instruct the Accountant to submit the complete 
supporting documents on payments amounting to P27,718.12 under LDDAP-ADA 
No. 101-101-04-106-2020 to facilitate the audit thereof. 
 
 

Unsettled Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 
 
The FPRDI had no unsettled Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges as of December 
31, 2020. 
 
 
Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 
The Audit Team validated the actions taken by the FPRDI to implement the audit 
recommendations contained in Calendar Year (CY) 2019 Annual Audit Report (AAR).  
Of the 33 audit recommendations, 23 were fully implemented, eight were partially 
implemented and two were not implemented.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
 
 
Dr. ROMULO T. AGGANGAN 
Director  
Forest Products Research and Development Institute 
Los Baños, Laguna 
 
 
Qualified Opinion 
 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of the Forest Products Research 
and Development Institute (FPRDI), which comprise the Statement of Financial Position 
as at December 31, 2020, and the Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of 
Changes in Net Assets/Equity, Statement of Cash Flows, Statement of Comparison of 
Budget and Actual Amounts for the year then ended, and Notes to Financial Statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting policies.  
 
In our opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the Bases for Qualified 
Opinion section of our report, the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the FPRDI as at December 
31, 2020, and its financial performance, changes in net assets/equity, cash flows, and 
comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended in accordance with 
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS).  
 
 
Bases for Qualified Opinion  
 
1. The Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account balance as of December 31, 

2020, of P591,502,294.47 (gross) is of doubtful validity and reliability, due to the: 
(a) net difference of P168,087,319.38 between the General Ledger’s balance and 
that of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment 
(RPCPPE); and (b) non-disposal of unserviceable PPE items amounting to 
P2,088,294.72, inconsistent with Section 38, Chapter 10 of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I 
and the Handbook on Property and Supply Management System, thus affecting 
the fair presentation of the PPE and other related accounts in the financial 
statements. 

 
2. The non-reclassification of the cost of the completed project and non-recording of 

the ongoing infrastructure project resulted in net understatement of P123,157.65 
in the Construction in Progress (CIP) account amounting to P900,720.02 in the 
Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020, contrary to Section 8.g, 
Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.

3. The Due to NGAs account as of December 31, 2020, amounting to P3,106,903.62 
remained unrefunded and/or unliquidated despite completion of the projects due 
to the absence of available records and is still subject for reconciliation, contrary 
to Sections 6.5 and 6.7 of Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 94-013 dated 
December 13, 1994, thus exposed the said unrefunded funds to possible 
misappropriation or misapplication.  
 

4. The absence of proper monitoring and reconciliation of the subsidiary accounts of 
the Due to Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) account is contrary to Sections 123 
and 124 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445. This has resulted in unreconciled 
balance of P615,178.56 and abnormal negative balances of 60 subsidiary ledger 
(SL) accounts amounting to P65,889.11. Thus, affecting the fair presentation of 
the said accounts in the financial statements. 

 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 
Institutions (ISSAIs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in 
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the agency in accordance with the Revised Code of 
Conduct and Ethical Standards for Commission on Audit Officials and Employees (Code 
of Ethics) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the Philippines, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion.  
 
Key Audit Matters  
 
Except for the matters described in the bases for the Qualified Opinion Section, we have 
determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report.  
 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the 
Financial Statements  
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in accordance with IPSAS, and for such internal control as Management 
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  
 
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the agency’s financial 
reporting process.  
 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements  
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or 
error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of these financial statements.

FOREST PRODUCTS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE 
 

Notes to Financial Statements 
For the year ended December 31, 2020 

 
1. Agency Profile 
 

The financial statements of Forest Products Research and Development Institute 
(FPRDI) were authorized for issue on February 22, 2021, as shown in the 
Statement of Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statements signed by 
Ms. Franz Carisse S. Samiano, Officer-in-Charge (OIC)-FAD Accounting Section 
and Dr. Romulo T. Aggangan, Director on February 22, 2021. 
 
The FPRDI is primarily tasked with discovering potential uses of the nation’s 
forest products resources and improving technologies to support the wood-based 
industries and the forest products help the public attain greater productivity and 
profitability.  Since the inception, the FPRDI has undergone several transitions.  It 
started as a division of the former Bureau of Forestry in 1954.  In 1957, it was 
reconstituted into the Forest Products Research Institute (FPRI).  It became the 
Forest Products Research and Industries Development Commission 
(FORPRIDECOM) and attached to the National Science Development Board 
(NSDB) on June 21, 1969, by Virtue of Republic Act (RA) No. 5526.  During the 
reorganization of 1974, the Agency maintained its status as a Commission 
although its structure was drastically changed. 
 
On March 17, 1982, Executive Order (EO) No. 784 reconstituted 
FORPRIDECOM into the FPRDI as a line agency of the National Science and 
Technology Authority (NSTA).  Lately, under EO No. 128, approved on January 
30, 1987, the FPRDI was reorganized but retained its status as a line institute of 
the NSTA, now the Department of Science and Technology (DOST). 
 
Under EO No. 128, the FPRDI is mandated to generate scientific knowledge, 
technologies, and information necessary to attain the optimal utilization of forest 
products resources, ensure that the results of its Research and Development 
(R&D) activities are actually utilized by the different sectors, render technical 
services and provide training for the industries for the ultimate social and 
economic benefit of the people. 
 

2. Statement of Compliance and Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements 
 

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and comply 
with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) issued by the 
Commission on Audit (COA) per COA Resolution No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 
2020. 
 
The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, 
unless stated otherwise. The statement of Cash Flows is prepared using the 
Direct Method. 
 
 
 



 
 

11 
 

 
3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

 
3.1 Basis of Accounting 

 
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis in accordance 
with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). 
 

3.2 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash at bank, 
deposits on call and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 
three months or less, which are readily convertible to known amounts of 
cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For the 
purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, Cash and Cash 
Equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits as defined above, net of 
outstanding bank overdrafts. 
 

3.3 Inventories 
 
Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition. To the extent that 
inventory was received through non-exchange transactions (for no cost or 
for a nominal cost), the cost of the inventory is its fair value at the date of 
acquisition. Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location 
and conditions are accounted for, as follows: 
 

 Raw materials: purchase cost using the weighted average cost method 
 

 Finished goods and work in progress: cost of direct materials and labor 
and a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on the normal 
operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs 

 
After initial recognition, inventory is measured at the lower of cost and net 
realizable value. However, to the extent that a class of inventory is 
distributed or deployed at no charge or for a nominal charge, that class of 
inventory is measured at the lower of cost and current replacement cost. 
 
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
operations, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs 
necessary to make the sale, exchange, or distribution. 
 
Inventories are recognized as an expense when deployed for utilization or 
consumption in the ordinary course of operations of the FPRDI.  
 

3.4 Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) 
 

Recognition 
 
An item is recognized as PPE if it meets the characteristics and recognition 
criteria as a PPE. 
 



 
 

12 
 

 
The characteristics of PPE are as follows: 
 

 tangible items; 
 

 are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for 
rental to others, or for administrative purposes; and 

 

 are expected to be used during more than one reporting period. 
 

Measurement at Recognition 
 
An item recognized as PPE is measured at cost. 
 
A PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction is measured at its fair 
value as at the date of acquisition. 
 
The cost of the PPE is the cash price equivalent, or for PPE acquired 
through non-exchange transaction its cost is its fair value as at recognition 
date. 
 
Cost includes the following: 
 

 its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase 
taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates; 
 

 expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items; and 
 

 initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and 
restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity 
incurs either when the item is acquired, or as a consequence of having 
used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to 
produce inventories during that period. 

 
Measurement After Recognition 
 
After recognition, all PPE are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses. 
 
When significant parts of PPE are required to be replaced at intervals, the 
FPRDI recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives 
and depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major 
repair/replacement is done, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of 
the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are 
satisfied. 
 
All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense in surplus 
or deficit as incurred. 
 
 



 
 

13 
 

 
Depreciation 
 
Each part of an item of ppe with a cost that is significant in relation to the 
total cost of the item is depreciated separately. 
 
The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expense unless it 
is included in the cost of another asset. 
 
Initial Recognition of Depreciation 
 
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it 
is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in 
the manner intended by Management. 
 
For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation is for 
one month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month. 
However, if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, 
depreciation is for the succeeding month. 
 
Depreciation Method 
 
The straight line method of depreciation is adopted unless another method is 
more appropriate for agency operation. 
 
Estimated Useful Life 
 
The FPRDI uses the Schedule on the Estimated Useful Life of PPE by 
classification prepared by the COA. 
 
The FPRDI uses a residual value equivalent to at least five percent of the 
cost of the PPE. 
 
Derecognition 
 
The FPRDI derecognizes items of PPE and/or any significant part of an 
asset upon disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential 
is expected from its continuing use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition 
of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the surplus or deficit 
when the asset is derecognized. 
 

3.5 Intangible Assets 
 

Recognition and Measurement 
 
Intangible assets are recognized when the items are identifiable non-
monetary assets without physical substance; it is probable that the expected 
future economic benefits or service potential that are attributable to the 
assets will flow to the entity; and the cost or fair value of the assets can be 
measured reliably. 



 
 

14 
 

 
Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognized at cost. 
 
If payment for an intangible asset is deferred beyond normal credit terms, its 
cost is the cash price equivalent. The difference between this amount and 
the total payments is recognized as interest expense over the period of 
credit unless it is capitalized in accordance with the capitalization treatment 
permitted in IPSAS 5, Borrowing Costs. 
 
Subsequent Expenditure on an Acquired In-process Research and 
Development Project 
 
Subsequent expenditure on an in-process research or development project 
acquired separately and recognized as an intangible asset is: 
 

 recognized as an expense when incurred if it is research expenditure; 
 

 recognized as an expense when incurred if it is development 
expenditure that does not satisfy the criteria for recognition as an 
intangible asset; and 
 

 added to the carrying amount of the acquired in-process research or 
development project if it is development expenditure that satisfies the 
recognition criteria for intangible assets. 

 
Intangible Assets Acquired through Non-Exchange Transactions 
 
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a non-exchange transaction is their 
fair value at the date these were acquired. 
 
Internally Generated Intangible Assets 
 
Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalized development 
costs, are not capitalized and expenditure is reflected in surplus or deficit in 
the period in which the expenditure is incurred. 
 
Recognition of an Expense 
 
Expenditure on an intangible item was recognized as an expense when it is 
incurred unless it forms part of the cost of an intangible asset that meets the 
recognition criteria of an intangible asset. 
 
Subsequent Measurement 
 
The useful life of the intangible assets is assessed as either finite or 
indefinite. Intangible assets with a finite life are amortized over their useful 
lives. 
 
The straight line method is adopted in the amortization of the expected 
pattern of consumption of the expected future economic benefits or service 
potential. 



 
 

15 
 

 
An intangible asset with indefinite useful lives was not be amortized. 
 
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life or an intangible asset not yet 
available for use were assessed for impairment whenever there is an 
indication that the asset may be impaired. 
 
The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset 
with a finite useful life were reviewed at the end of each reporting period. 
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption 
of future economic benefits embodied in the asset were considered to 
modify the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and were treated 
as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on an 
intangible asset with a finite life is recognized in surplus or deficit as the 
expense category that is consistent with the nature of the intangible asset. 
 
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset were 
measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and were recognized in the surplus or deficit 
when the asset is derecognized. 
 
Research and development costs 
 
The FPRDI’s expenses research costs are recognized as incurred. 
Development costs on an individual project were recognized as intangible 
assets when the FPRDI can demonstrate: 
 

 the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that the asset will be 
available for use or sale 
 

 its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset 
 

 how the asset will generate future economic benefits or service potential 
 

 the availability of resources to complete the asset 
 

 the ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development 
 

Following initial recognition, intangible assets were carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. 
 
Amortization of the asset begins when development is complete and the 
asset is available for use. 
 
It is amortized over the period of expected future benefit. 
 
During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment 
annually with any impairment losses recognized immediately in surplus or 
deficit. 
 



 
 

16 
 

 
3.6 Changes in accounting policies and estimates 

 
The FPRDI recognizes the effects of changes in accounting policy 
retrospectively. The effects of changes in accounting policy were applied 
prospectively if retrospective application is impractical. 
 
The FPRDI recognizes the effects of changes in accounting estimates 
prospectively by including in surplus or deficit. 
 
The FPRDI correct material prior period’s errors retrospectively in the first 
set of financial statements authorized for issue after their discovery by: 
 

 restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in which 
the error occurred; or 
 

 if the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating 
the opening balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for the 
earliest prior period presented. 
 

3.7 Revenue from Exchange transactions 
 
Measurement of Revenue 
 
Revenue was measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable. 
 
Rendering of Services 
 
The FPRDI recognizes revenue from rendering of services by reference to 
the stage of completion when the outcome of the transaction can be 
estimated reliably. The stage of completion is measured by reference to 
labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated labor hours. 
 
Where the contract outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is 
recognized only to the extent that the expenses incurred were recoverable. 
 
Rental income 
 
Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is 
accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and included in 
revenue. 
 

3.8 Budget information 
 
The annual budget is prepared on a cash basis and is published in the 
government website. 
 
A separate Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts 
(SCBAA) was prepared since the budget and the financial statements were 
not prepared on comparable basis. The SCBAA was presented showing the 



 
 

17 
 

original and final budget and the actual amounts on comparable basis to the 
budget. Explanatory comments are provided in the notes to the annual 
financial statements. 
 

3.9 Employees’ benefits 
 
The employees of the FPRDI are members of the Government Service 
Insurance System (GSIS), which provides life and retirement insurance 
coverage. 
 
The FPRDI recognizes the undiscounted amount of short term employee 
benefits, like salaries, wages, bonuses, allowance, etc., as expense unless 
capitalized, and as a liability after deducting the amount paid. 
 
The FPRDI recognizes expenses for accumulating compensated absences 
when these were paid (commuted or paid as terminal leave benefits). 
Unused entitlements that have accumulated at the reporting date were not 
recognized as expense. Non-accumulating compensated absences, like 
special leave privileges, were not recognized. 
 

4. Prior Period and Other Adjustments 
 
The FPRDI has determined that fundamental errors of prior years are corrected 
by restating the balance of government equity through the Accumulated 
Surplus/Deficit account.  Errors affecting current year’s operation are charged to 
the current year’s accounts.

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

1. The Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account’s balance as of December 31, 
2020, of P591,502,294.47 (gross) is of doubtful validity and reliability due to the:   
(a) net difference of P168,087,319.38 between the General Ledger’s balance and 
that of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment 
(RPCPPE); and (b) non-disposal of unserviceable PPE items amounting to 
P2,088,294.72, inconsistent with Section 38, Chapter 10 of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I 
and the Handbook on Property and Supply Management System, thus affecting 
the fair presentation of the PPE and other related accounts in the financial 
statements. 
 
Section 38, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides: 
 

“Physical Count of PPE. The entity shall have a periodic physical count of 
PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the 
Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 
71) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the 
Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. 
Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical 
count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper 
accounting/recording.” 

 
Likewise, the Handbook on Property and Supply Management System further 
prescribes:  
 

“After the physical inventory taking, the Inventory Committee shall 
reconcile the results of the count with the property and accounting 
records. xxx the inventory listing of the equipment shall be compared with 
the property card maintained by the property/supply officer as against the 
equipment ledger cards maintained by the accounting and the total 
thereof shall be reconciled with the control accounts in the general ledger. 
xxx. All discrepancies between the physical and book inventories must be 
investigated, cleared and reconciled immediately. If necessary, written 
explanation shall be required from accountable and responsible person.”  

 
The above provisions emphasize that physical inventory-taking is an indispensable 
procedure for checking the validity, existence and correctness of reported balances of 
assets, as well as integrity of property custodianship. Reconciling the records of the 
Accountant against the actual inventory count as well as validating the Property 
Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) issued to end-users, are all basic procedures to 
implement the effective internal control for PPEs. 
 
Moreover, Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020, 
prescribes the guidelines and procedures on inventory-taking, recognition of those found 
at station and disposition for non-existing/missing PPE items for the one-time cleansing 
of PPE accounts of government agencies to establish the PPE’s balances that are 
verifiable as to existence, condition and accountability.

a) There was a difference of P168,087,319.38 between the General Ledger (GL)’s 
balance and that of the RPCPPE 
 

The Calendar Year (CY) 2020 Statement of Financial Position reflected a total PPE 
account balance (gross) of P591,502,294.47.  Comparison of the GL balances and the 
balances per Inventory for each type of PPE is shown in the table below:

     Total P591,502,294.47  P423,414,975.09  P168,087,319.38  

 
As can be viewed from the table above, the total balance per GL compared with the 
Inventory Report showed a net variance of P168,087,319.38. The Accounting and 
Property Sections did not reconcile their records of PPE accounts despite prior year’s 
audit observations and recommendations relative thereto, contrary to the 
aforementioned provisions. 
 
The Audit Team conducted reconciliation of the PPE schedules maintained by the 
Accounting Section and the submitted RPCPPE as presented in (Annex A). Verification 
of the PPE accounts and records disclosed the following factors which have caused the 
noted variances: 
 
1) There are items found at the station and included in the RPCPPE amounting to 

P18,398,095.99 and P3,332,784.85 under the General and Trust Funds, 
respectively, (Annexes B and C) which were not recorded in the books of accounts,

Furthermore, it was noted that the RPCPPE were not properly accomplished since the 
details for columns Article, Unit of Measure, Quantity per Property Card and per Physical 
Count, Shortage/Overage and Remarks were not provided. 

 
The Property Officer had explained that another contributing factor for the discrepancy 
was the disposal and sale of unserviceable PPE items in prior years that were noted 
condemned in the RPCPPE. However, no report was forwarded to the Accounting 
Section, thus the immediate derecognition of the same was not effected. The guidelines 
in reconciliation of records and verification of these undocumented disposals are 
provided in COA Circular No. 2020-006. This Circular prescribes the procedures on 



31 
 

inventory-taking, recognition of those found at station and disposition for non-
existing/missing PPE items for the one-time cleansing of PPE accounts, to come up with 
reliable PPE balance that are verifiable as to existence, condition and accountability. 

 
The foregoing conditions and the net discrepancy of P168,087,319.38 between the 
books and the RPCPPE render the accuracy and reliability of the recorded balance of 
PPE account doubtful. 
 
We recommended that the Director direct: 
 

a. all of the concerned Divisions to prepare list of existing PPE per office 
under their custody for submission to, and verification of the Property 
Section prior to the conduct of actual inventory by the Inventory 
Committee; 
 

b. the Property Section to update its records based on the results of the initial 
inventory and coordinate with the Accounting Section to reconcile the 
Property Cards with the PPE Ledger Cards (PPELCs); 
 

c. the Accounting Section to take-up necessary journal entries to recognize 
PPEs found at station and prepare/maintain the corresponding PPELCs; 

 
d. the Inventory Committee to: 

 

 conduct physical count of all the PPE, whether acquired through 
purchase or donation, and prepare and submit the RPCPPE, in 
compliance with Section 38, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I;  

 

 ensure that full reconciliation of the inventory count documented in 
RPCPPE with the records maintained by Accounting Section is properly 
made to establish the correct balance of PPE, and  

 

 strictly comply with the guidelines and procedures on inventory-taking, 
recognition of those found at station and disposition for non-
existing/missing PPE items for the one-time cleansing of PPE accounts 
of the FPRDI, in accordance with COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated 
January 31, 2020; and 

 
e. the Property and Accounting Sections to perform periodic reconciliation of 

their records, to ensure that all discrepancies are immediately investigated, 
cleared and reconciled.  

 
b) Failure to dispose unserviceable PPE items amounting to P2,088,294.72, 

contrary to Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, thereby resulting 
to further deterioration brought about by continuous exposure to natural 
elements, hence decreasing their saleable value. 

 
Section 79 of PD No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the 
Philippines, provides: 
 



32 
 

“When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or 
is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable 
therefor, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized 
representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to 
be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found 
to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under 
the supervision of the proper committee an award or similar body in the 
presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative 
of the Commission.” 

 
Furthermore, Section 40(d), Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that “All 
unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of 
Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74).  PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be 
dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment 
(cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation).” 

 
Review of the submitted RPCPPE showed that the following PPE items amounting to 
P2,088,294.72 were already unserviceable but remained undisposed, contrary to 
Section 79 of PD No. 1445:

Despite the conditions of unserviceability of these items, Management has not prepared 
IIRUP nor disposed the said properties. 
 
The delay in their disposal would subject these properties to further deterioration and 
lessen their potential saleable price. 

 
We recommended that Management: 

 
a. create a Disposal Committee and instruct the same to dispose 

unserviceable properties, pursuant to Section 79 of PD No. 1445, in order to 
avoid further deterioration, thus enabling the FPRDI to have better chance 
of recovery of its residual values; 
 

b. require the Property Officer to prepare the prescribed IIRUP as basis of 
dropping from the books the said unserviceable properties carried in the 
PPE accounts, pursuant to Section 40(d), Chapter 10 and Appendix 74 of 
GAM for NGAs, Volumes I and II, respectively; and 
 

c. instruct the concerned employee to submit the IIRUP to the Accountant 
upon completion of the disposal activity, and ensure that the original copy 
of the report will be the basis in the proper adjustment of the balance of 
affected PPE accounts through a duly approved Journal Entry Voucher 
(JEV). 

 
Management‟s Comment: 
 
Management commented that the reconciliation of records between the Accounting and 
Property Sections were not accomplished due to the following: 
 

a. The RPCPPE was submitted by the Property Inventory and Disposal Committee 
to the Accounting Section only on March 5, 2021; and 
 

b. The Covid-19 pandemic situation limits the physical reporting of all staff, thus 
partial physical count of PPEs was conducted only in November and December 
2020. 
 

With regard to the failure to dispose the unserviceable PPE items, some of these items 
were not yet submitted by the concerned end-users to the Chair of the Property 
Inventory and Disposal Committee.  
 
Accordingly, the following actions will be made by the concerned personnel: 
 

a. Reconciliation of records based on the 2020 RPCPPEs will be accomplished by 
the Accounting and Property Sections before the end of July 2021; 
 

b. Disposal of unserviceable PPE items and submission of IIRUP will be made by 
the Property Inventory and Disposal Committee before the end of August 31, 
2021; 
 

c. Physical count of PPEs will be conducted by the Committee starting July 1 to 
November 30, 2021; and  



34 
 

d. Adjustment in the accounting books based on the 2021 physical count will be 
made by the Accounting Section before the end of December 31, 2021. 
 

Auditor‟s Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team will monitor the implementation of the actions to be taken by 
Management to comply with the audit recommendations. 
 

2. The non-reclassification of the cost of the completed project and non-recording of 
the ongoing infrastructure project resulted in net understatement of P123,157.65 
in the Construction in Progress (CIP) account amounting to P900,720.02 in the 
Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020, contrary to Section 8.g, 
Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government 
Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. 
 
Section 8.g, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides: 
 

“During the construction period, all expenses incurred in relation to the 
construction of the PPE shall be taken up in the books as Construction in 
Progress (CIP) with the appropriate asset classification. As soon as the 
construction is completed, the „Construction in Progress‟ account shall be 
reclassified to the proper asset account. Likewise, all expenses such as 
interests, license fees, etc., during the construction period shall be 
capitalized.” 

 
Review of the CIP account disclosed a balance in the amount of P900,720.02 as of 
December 31, 2020. Further examination of records showed that the balance pertains to 
the Detailed Engineering Activities for calendar year (CY) 2018 of completed 
infrastructure projects amounting to P900,720.02. The amount was not yet reclassified to 
the appropriate completed PPE accounts despite the prior year’s audit 
recommendations. This overstated the CIP and understated PPE - Building accounts by 
the same amount. Also, the corresponding depreciation expense was not recognized in 
the Statement of Financial Performance.  
 
Verification of Report on Information and Publicity of Government 
Projects/Programs/Activities (PPAs) prepared by the Project Engineer for the fourth 
quarter of 2020 revealed an ongoing infrastructure project with contract cost of 
P1,259,998.47 entitled “Additional Repair and Maintenance Ground Floor and Basement 
Area of TDC Building (Design and Build) for the Proposed Processing Facility of 
Bamboo and Other (Variation/Extra Work Order) Lignocellulosic Materials”, incurred the 
amount of P1,023,877.67 as of year-end. It was disclosed that the Billing No. 1 dated 
December 15, 2020, from the Contractor representing 81.26 percent accomplishment 
was forwarded and received by the Finance and Administrative Division on December 
16, 2020. However, no Journal Entry was made to record the CIP and the Accounts 
Payable accounts to reflect the ongoing project amounting to P1,023,877.67. 
 
Inquiry with Management disclosed that the Detailed Engineering Activities for CY 2018 
in the amount of P900,720.02 was still included in the CIP account as of December 31, 
2020, since the Project Engineer submitted his report for the 4th quarter of 2020 with 
“contract terminated” remarks only on February 24, 2021. The Accountant had no time to 



35 
 

reclassify the account to completed infrastructure because the Annual Financial 
Statements was already due for submission during that time. 
 
As for the P1,023,877.67 for the ongoing infrastructure project of the Training and 
Demonstration Center (TDC) Building, the Accountant failed to record the CIP account 
because the transaction pertained to Trust Fund account. The Accountant recorded only 
the unpaid obligations in the General Fund as accounts payable. 
 
The foregoing conditions resulted in the net understatement of P123,157.65 of the CIP 
account in the Statement of Financial Position.  
 
We recommended that the Director direct the Accountant to: 
 

a. prepare the Journal Entry Vouchers to adjust for the understatement/ 
(overstatement) in the CIP account duly supported with the necessary 
documentations, and submit the same to the Audit Team for verification;  
 

b. ensure that all ongoing infrastructure projects are properly recorded under 
the appropriate CIP account and duly reconciled with the records of the 
Project Engineer to reflect in the financial statements the infrastructure 
projects of the FPRDI, which are still ongoing construction; and 
 

c. require the Project Engineer to submit his report on or before the 5
th

 day 
after the end of the quarter. 

 
Management‟s Comment: 
 
Management committed to comply with the audit recommendations, and to avoid the 
recurrence of the said errors.  Accordingly, they will direct the Accountant to: 
 

a. submit the Journal Entry Vouchers for CIP account before the end of June 2021; 
 
b. record in the accounting books all obligations for which goods/services/projects 

have been delivered/rendered/completed and accepted regardless of source of 
funds; and 

 
c. require the Project Engineer to submit his report on or before the 5th day after 

end of the quarter. 
 

3. The Due to National Government Agencies (NGAs) account as of December 31, 
2020, amounting to P3,106,903.62 remained unrefunded and/or unliquidated 
despite completion of the projects due to the absence of available records and  is 
still subject for reconciliation, contrary to Sections 6.5 and 6.7 of Commission on 
Audit (COA) Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994, thus exposed the said  
unrefunded funds to possible misappropriation or misapplication.  
 
Sections 6.5 and 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994, are 
applicable in the financial transactions of National Government and instrumentalities 
involving the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to implementing 
agencies.  Thus, one of the duties and responsibilities of the implementing agencies is to 
submit liquidation reports within the prescribed period, to wit: 



36 
 

 
“6.5 Within ten (10) days after receipt from the AO, the Accountant shall 
verify the Reports, provide accounting entries, record and submit the 
duplicate copies of the Reports with all the originals of vouchers/payrolls 
and all supporting documents to the IA Auditor.  The Accountant shall 
ensure that only expenses for the project are included in the Reports.  He 
shall submit the original copy of the Reports to the Source Agency (SA) 
(Attention: The SA Accountant).” 

 
“6.7 return to the SA any unused balance and refund of disallowance 
upon completion of the project.” 

 
Likewise, COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, sets forth the revised 
guidelines and documentary requirements for common government transactions. 
Section 3 of the same Circular specifically provides for the documentary requirements on 
the liquidation of fund transfers, as follows: 

 
“3.1.2 Implementation and Liquidation 

 
Implementing Agency: 
 

 Necessary supporting documents depending on the nature of 
transactions 
 

 Copy of MOA/Trust Agreement 
 

 Copy of Official Receipt (OR) upon receipt of funds transferred 
 

 Copy of OR issued by the Source Agency evidencing refund of 
unexpended/unutilized balance of fund transferred” 

 
As of December 31, 2020, the reported balance of Due to NGAs account is 
P48,536,300.13. This account represents funds received from various NGAs for the 
implementation of various locally funded projects. Out of the 58 outstanding Subsidiary 
Ledger (SL) balances, 41 SLs amounting to P3,106,903.62 (Annex G) were completed 
projects and already due for liquidation as of year-end. 
 
Review of the accounts revealed that 34 non-moving accounts for reconciliation 
amounting to P2,811,486.02 have no available records. The immediate settlement of the 
said balances could not be facilitated since specifications on the details such as the 
exact length of existence of these items in the books, detailed purpose and breakdown 
of project cost and utilization were not available. In addition, the Memorandum of 
Agreement (MOA) of these projects as required in the liquidation of accounts, has not 
been produced and located. 
 
On the other hand, the seven completed projects with Due to NGAs balance of 
P295,417.60 were not yet fully liquidated for less than one year to over 6 years and still 
subject for reconciliation, as summarized on the next page.

Verification revealed that the amount of P3,106,903.62  remain unrefunded and/or 
unliquidated to the SA/National Treasury despite completion of the projects, in violation 
of Sections 6.5 and 6.7, and 3.1.2 of COA Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2012-001, 
respectively. 
 
The absence of proper and complete documentations to settle the accounts resulted in 
the delayed liquidation and unreturned unexpended funds, if there is any, to SA for 
completed projects.  
 
This is a reiteration of prior year’s audit observations. 
 
We recommended that the Director instruct the Accountant to: 

 
a. locate the MOA/Trust Agreements with the source agencies and 

Financial/Terminal Reports to determine the detail and nature of the 
accounts to settle the balance of P2,811,486.02; 

 
b. review prior years’ transactions and perform reconciliation, in coordination 

with the Program/Project Leader, to fully liquidate the completed projects 
with remaining balance of P295,417.60, and effect the necessary 
adjustments to settle the balance, if warranted; and  
 

c. record in the books of accounts the liquidations submitted by the 
Program/Project Leader, submit the Financial/Terminal Reports and refund 
the excess project funds to the source/funding agencies, immediately after 
the completion of the project, in compliance with Sections 6.5 and 6.7 of 
COA Circular No. 94-013. 

 
Management‟s Comment: 
 
Management commented that the said audit observation was already raised in 2019 per 
Audit Observation (AOM) No. 2020-005 (2019) received on September 14, 2020. The 
Accountant had insufficient time to comply with the audit recommendation due to the 
Covid-19 pandemic situation that limits the physical reporting of the accounting staff. The 
Accountant was also on maternity leave, thus there was less staff who will work on the 
reconciliation. The Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the Section prioritized the submission of 
monthly trial balance and annual financial statements and the processing of the bulky 



38 
 

transactions during the year end. The reconciliation of accounts requires a lot of time to 
do. 
 
During the 4th quarter of 2020, the Accountant has established partial reconciliation of 
data. As for the remaining unreconciled accounts, the Accountant will accomplish it 
before the end of December 31, 2021. 
 
Auditor‟s Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team recognized the efforts of Management to comply despite the current 
situation, and the limited time and personnel due to the pandemic. However, a proper 
planning of the actions to be taken by concerned employees should be put in place to 
establish the timeline to fully implement the audit recommendations. 

 
4. The absence of proper monitoring and reconciliation of the subsidiary accounts of 

the Due to Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) account is contrary to Sections 123 
and 124 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445. This has resulted in unreconciled 
balance of P615,178.56 and abnormal negative balances of 60 subsidiary ledger 
(SL) accounts amounting to P65,889.11. Thus, affecting the fair presentation of the 
said accounts in the financial statements.  
 
Section 123 defines that “Internal control as the plan of organization and all the 
coordinate methods and measures adopted within an organization or agency to 
safeguard its assets, check the accuracy and reliability of its accounting data, and 
encourage adherence to prescribed managerial policies.”  

 
Also, Section 124 of the PD No. 1445 states that “It shall be the direct responsibility of 
the agency head to install, implement, and monitor a sound system of internal control.”   
 
The Due to BIR account is used to record the withholding of taxes from 
officers/employees and other entities for remittance to the BIR.  

 
A sound internal control system requires that there should be adequate checking and 
reconciling procedure to produce accurate records. The responsibility for fair 
presentation and reliability of financial statements rests with Management of the 
reporting agency. All financial data should be accurate and reliable.  
 
The Due to BIR account representing taxes withheld from officers and employees, 
suppliers and contractors as of December 31, 2020, reported the balance of 
P3,583,353.78. 
 
Review of records disclosed that taxes withheld under the Due to BIR account 
amounting to P2,887,452.29 were remitted in January 2021, resulting in unremitted 
balance of P695,901.49.  Upon inquiry, the Accountant stated that part of the unremitted 
balance were the taxes withheld for the unpaid Accounts Payable. Based on records, 
only the amount of P80,722.93 were not yet due for remittance. Consequently, an 
unreconciled balance of P615,178.56 (Annex H) was noted.  
 
Analysis also revealed that 60 subsidiary accounts from the balance showed abnormal 
negative balances totaling P65,889.11, as summarized on the next page.

The existence of negative balances may indicate over remittance, error in posting of 
remittances or error in recording late charges as part of remittances. The Accountant 
asserted that the accumulated balance of the Due to BIR account of P615,178.56 is 
subject for reconciliation. 
 
Failure to correct the negative balances and reconcile the records of the subsidiary 
accounts resulted in the unreliable presentation of the balance of the Due to BIR account 
in the financial statements. 

 
We recommended that the Director direct the Accountant to: 
 

a. trace prior years’ accounting entries to ascertain the cause of abnormal 
negative balances; 
 



40 
 

b. review and analyze records pertaining to the unreconciled balances in the 
SLs of the Due to BIR account; and 

 
c. immediately adjust the unreconciled and abnormal account balances to 

correct and update SL balances, and/or refund over remittances, if there 
are any. 

 
Management‟s Comment: 
 
Management commented that prior to 2018, it was the practice of the FPRDI to monitor 
the Due to BIR account manually, and the BIR vouchers submitted by the Cash Section 
were the bases for the preparation of remittances. This practice contributed to the 
unreconciled balance of the Due to BIR account.  
 
To prevent the accumulation of unreconciled balances and to ensure that all taxes 
withheld are remitted, the Accountant has been using the Reports being submitted by 
the Cash Section and the reports being generated in the electronic New Government 
Accounting System (e-NGAS) as the bases for the preparation of the Due to BIR 
remittances.  
 
As for the prior year’s unreconciled balances, the Accountant will designate one 
accounting staff to trace the prior year’s transactions, prepare adjusting entries and remit 
if any the outstanding balances.  
 
Management assured that the audit recommendations will be accomplished before the 
end of August 2021. 
 

5. The non-submission of Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs), together with their supporting 
documents is contrary to the provision of Appendix 36 of the Government Accounting 
Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume II and Section 7.2.1 
of the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) prescribed under 
Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009.  This 
also hindered the Audit Team  in  verification of the recorded transactions of FPRDI. 
 
Appendix 36 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II states that JEV shall be used to record all 
transactions of the NGAs, whether cash receipts, cash disbursements or non-cash 
transactions. Accounting journal entries shall be reflected therein and it shall serve as 
the basis for recording in the books of accounts. 
 
The original JEVs shall be submitted to the COA Auditor, together with the supporting 
documents, after recording in the journals for post-audit, as mentioned in the instructions 
for JEVs of the said Manual. 
 
Section 7.2.1 of the RRSA prescribed under COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated 
September 15, 2009, cites the responsibility of the Accountant in the submission of 
reports and accounts, as follows: 
 

“The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing 
accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall 
ensure that: 
 



41 
 

a. The reports and supporting documents submitted by the accountable 
officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and 
submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of ensuing 
month.” 

 
Post-audit of the accounts of the Forest Products Research and Development Institute 
(FPRDI) disclosed that Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) for all transactions for CY 2020 
amounting to P1,422,587,761.23 were not submitted to the Auditor. The General Journal 
showed that this amount involved 4,624 journal entries as illustrated below:

57,075,910.42 1161 

     Total P1,422,587,761.23 4,624  

 
The JEVs for all funds consisted of the following transactions/reports: 
 

a. Disbursements 
b. Collections and deposits 
c. Liquidation of cash advances 
d. Amortization of Intangible Assets 
e. Depreciation of PPE 
f. Billing of creditor 
g. Set-up of payables 
h. Receipt of Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) 
i. Remittances of withholding tax 
j. Issuances of inventory items 
k. Beginning balances and automatic closing entries 
l. Other transactions/adjustments 

 
Interview with the Accountant disclosed that JEVs, together with supporting documents, 
were not submitted to the Auditor since FPRDI started using the electronic New 
Government Accounting System (eNGAS). The JEVs for all transactions were directly 
encoded in the eNGAS. Only transactions pertaining to disbursements, cash receipts 
and deposits, and liquidation of cash advances had supporting documents attached to 
the Disbursement Vouchers and submitted to the Auditor. Thus, the supporting 



42 
 

documents of JEVs for non-cash transactions from items d. to l. above were also not 
available for audit, which is crucial in the determination of the propriety of the 
transactions recorded. 
 
Moreover, the Audit Team was informed that the errors were discovered after the CY 
2020 balances were forwarded to CY 2021 books, thus adjusting entries for CY 2020 
were no longer accepted in the eNGAS. To correct the errors, the Accounting Section 
manually adjusted the 10 affected accounts. However, only the JEV to record the duly 
approved request for authority to write-off of dormant Other Receivables amounting to 
P108,771.34 was submitted. The JEVs, including the supporting documents, for nine 
other affected accounts were not submitted to the Audit Team for verification. 
 
Non-submission of the required JEVs, together with supporting documents, precluded 
the Audit Team from conducting audit of relevant and critical transactions. It also 
deprived Management on the prompt communication of audit results. 
 
We recommended that the Director instruct the Accountant to prepare and submit 
the JEVs, including their supporting documents, within the first 10 days of 
ensuing month. Also, submit immediately to the Audit Team the JEVs for 
transactions in CY 2020, particularly the non-cash transactions and manual 
adjustments made to facilitate verification in determining the correctness of the 
amount recorded. 

 
Management‟s Comment: 
 
Management commented that when the eNGAS was implemented in 2016 in the FPRDI, 
the Accountant had verbal agreement with the previous Auditor that instead of 
submitting JEVs for each transaction, General Journal will be submitted. This is because 
the JEVs can be viewed by the previous Auditor in the eNGAS since it was installed in 
the computers in the FPRDI COA Office. 
 
From 2016 to 2020, it had been the practice of the Accountant to submit the General 
Journal, together with the Trial Balance and other Financial Reports. Effective January 
2021, JEVs are being submitted to the FPRDI COA Office. 
 
As for the CY 2020 JEVs for non-cash transactions and nine remaining manual 
accounting entries, these will be submitted before the end of June 2021. 
 
Management committed that the audit recommendations will be strictly implemented in  
CY 2021 onwards. 
 

6. The delayed submission of disbursement vouchers, trial balances, financial 
statements and supporting schedules precluded the prompt audit of accounts and 
financial transactions, early detection and correction of errors/deficiencies and 
timely reporting of the audit results to Management, in contravention with Section 
122(2) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, Section 7.2.1 of the Rules and 
Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) as prescribed under Commission 
on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2009-006 and Section 60, Chapter 19 of Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. 
 
 



43 
 

Section 122 of PD No. 1445 provides: 
 

“Submission of Reports. Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies 
of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it require 
the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, 
disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers and other 
responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, 
physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other 
reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions. 
 
(2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents 
and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of 
payment of their salaries until they have complied with the requirements 
of the Commission.” 

 
Section 7.2.1 of the RRSA prescribed under COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated 
September 15, 2009, cites the responsibility of the Accountant in the submission of 
reports and accounts as follows: 
 

“The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing 
accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall 
ensure that: 

 
b. The reports and supporting documents submitted by the accountable 

officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and 
submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of ensuing 
month.” 

 
Moreover, Section 60, Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides:

Records showed that the Accounting Section failed to fully comply with the timely 
submission to the Audit Team of all paid Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) and their 
supporting documents, Liquidation Reports (LRs) and Report of Collections and 



44 
 

Deposits (RCDs) of all funds, from January to December of calendar year (CY) 2020, 
within the first ten days of the ensuing month. Audit revealed that the delays in 
submission of accounts of the Forest Products Research and Development Institute 
(FPRDI) ranged from six to 238 days. The quantity and number of days of delay in the 
submission of these DVs, LRs and RCDs are presented in detail in (Annex I).  
 
Likewise, verification disclosed that the monthly Trial Balance (TB) and quarterly 
financial statements and their supporting schedules for CY 2020 were not submitted to 
COA on the timelines set by Section 7.2 of the RRSA as prescribed under COA Circular 
No. 2009-006 and Section 60, Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. The schedule of

The late submission of the above financial records, DVs together with their supporting 
documents and reports, prevented the Audit Team the immediate audit of the financial 
transactions, hence any irregularities and/or errors committed cannot be immediately 
detected and corrected by Management. 
 



45 
 

Also, the above conditions caused delay and imposed undue constraint on the timely 
audit of the aforementioned accounts and transactions, and completion of the Annual 
Audit Report (AAR) on the FPRDI by the Audit Team. 
 
We recommended that Management direct the Chief Administrative Officer and the 
Accountant in ensuring that all DVs and financial reports are submitted to the 
Auditor within the prescribed period to facilitate timely audit of the accounts and 
transactions of the FPRDI, pursuant to Section 7.2.1 of the RRSA prescribed under 
COA Circular No. 2009-006 and Section 60, Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 
Otherwise, initiate appropriate action against the concerned personnel in 
accordance with Section 122(2) of PD No. 1445, if warranted. 

 
Management‟s Comment: 
 
Management commented that the Accountant was unable to timely submit the 
disbursement vouchers and other financial reports due to the following reasons:  
 

a. lockdown was imposed nationwide from March 17, 2020 to May 31 2020, which 
prevented the accounting staff to physically report to the office;  
 

b. alternative work arrangement was implemented in the office which limits the 
employees to physically report to the office by at least not more than 50 percent 
capacity; and 
  

c. there is no staff who physically report to the FPRDI COA Office to receive the 
disbursement vouchers and other financial reports. The staff detailed in the 
FPRDI COA Office reported only on October 1, 2020.  

 
To comply with the audit recommendation, the Accounting Section improved its process 
flow of disbursement and reporting by using the unified voucher monitoring. 
 
Auditor‟s Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team noted Management’s comment and acknowledged the intention to 
adjust to the current situation and comply with the mandatory submission of all DVs and 
financial reports. Likewise, the Audit Team will closely monitor the full implementation of 
the said audit recommendation. 
 

7. The Forest Products Research and Development Institute (FPRDI) did not provide 
a complete list of all its ongoing projects, and those that are to be implemented 
during the year at the prescribed time specified under Item 2.1 of Commission on 
Audit (COA) Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 2013. Likewise, it did not 
submit to the Auditor the copies of contracts and supporting documents on the 
seven procurement projects with total contract amount of P20,329,050.43, within 
five working days from execution thereof, contrary to Item 3.1.1 of COA Circular 
No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, thus precluded the Auditor in conducting 
timely review of the procurement activities. 
 
The COA, which has the exclusive authority to promulgate accounting and auditing rules 
and regulations, including those for the prevention and disallowance of irregular, 
unnecessary, excessive, extravagant or unconscionable expenditures or uses of 



46 
 

government funds and properties  issued COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 
2013, amending the guidelines  implementing all government 
projects/programs/activities of government agencies. The salient features of the Circular 
state: 
 

“a. General Guidelines 
 
xxx 

 
2.1 At the beginning of the year, all government agencies shall provide 
their respective assigned Supervising Auditors (SAs) and Audit Team 
Leaders (ATL) with a list of all on-going government 
projects/programs/activities („PPA‟) and those that are to be implemented 
during the year. The list shall include the project name; implementing unit, 
office or division if it is not the agency as a whole; brief description of the 
PPA; contractor or supplier, if any; mode of procurement; funding source; 
cost or approved budget; project duration including the start and 
completion dates; and location. Other information on the PPA may be 
requested by the SA or ATL anytime for the audit purposes.” 

 
COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, restated with amendment COA 
Circular No. 87-278 and COA Memorandum No. 2005-027, re: submission of copy of 
government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents to COA. Item 
3.1.1 of the said Circular provides: 
 

“Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the 
government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, 
including government-owned and controlled corporations and their 
subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents 
forming part thereof by reference of incorporation shall be furnished to the 
Auditor of the Agency concerned. In case of agencies audited on an 
engagement basis, submission of a copy of the contract and its 
supporting documents shall be to the Auditor of the mother agency or 
parent company, as the case may be.” 
 

Item 3.1.2 of the same Circular enumerates the required documents to be included in the 
submission of contracts.  
 
Moreover, Item 4.1 of same Circular states that any unjustified failure of the officials and 
employees concerned to comply with the requirements herein imposed shall be subject 
to the administrative disciplinary action provided in (a) Section 127 of Presidential 
Decree (PD) No. 1445; (b) Section 55, Title I-B, Book V of the Revised Administrative 
Code of 1987; and (c) Section 11 of Republic Act (RA) No. 6713. 
 
Verifications of the documents submitted by the FPRDI relative to its procurement 
activities during calendar year (CY) 2020 disclosed that it did not submit a list of all its 
respective ongoing projects, and those to be implemented during the year at the 
beginning of the year, contrary to the aforecited provisions of COA Circular. It is worthy 
to note, however, that the FPRDI complied with submission of all its ongoing projects on 
a quarterly basis.  
 



47 
 

Review of the procurement activities done by the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) for 
CY 2020 showed that copies of contracts and the required supporting documents for the 
projects being implemented, were not submitted to the Auditor within five working days 
from the execution of contract provided in the mentioned COA Circular. The Audit Team 
requested for the List of Procurement Projects/Contracts entered into in CY 2020, 
together with the complete bidding documents, in March 29, 2021, in compliance with 
RA No. 9184. In response thereto, Management submitted the documents relative to the 
procurement projects amounting to P20,329,050.43 (Annex J) on April 14, 2021, 
incurring delay ranging from 148 to 444 days.  
 
However, it was noted that the documents submitted were not consistently arranged and 
properly labeled, and the list of documents included in the submission of contracts were 
not attached. Thus, this precluded the immediate verification of the completion of the 
required documentations, contrary to COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 
2009, which is restated with amendment under COA Circular No. 87-278 and COA 
Memorandum No. 2005-027. 
 
Moreover, it was noted that the copy of contracts of five projects totaling P18,070,500.00 
for the supply and delivery of goods and services were not attached to the submitted 
documents, to wit:

The delay in the submission of the contracts and their supporting documents prevented 
the Auditor in conducting timely review and verification of the transactions, which 
eventually delay the process of communicating to Management of any deficiency/ies 
noted. 
 
We recommended that the Director: 
 

a. direct the concerned officials to prepare the complete list of all ongoing 
projects, programs and activities (PPAs) and those that are to be 
implemented during the year, for audit validation and verification; and 

 
b. instruct the FPRDI BAC to provide valid explanations on non-submission of 

the contracts and supporting documents pertaining to the above projects. 
 
We further recommended that henceforth, the guidelines prescribed in COA 
Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, on the submission of contracts 



48 
 

and supporting documents within five working days from the execution of a 
contract/purchase order be strictly complied by the BAC Secretariat. 
 

Management‟s Comment: 
 

Management commented that the Chief of Property and Supply Section/Head of BAC 
Secretariat for CY 2020 was unable to timely comply with the requirement due to the 
following reasons:  

 
a. There was an incomplete turn-over of documents to the newly created BAC 

Secretariat 2020, to include the mandatory reports that should have been 
submitted to COA during the transition period from the former Deputy 
Director/BAC Chairperson 2019 and Head of BAC Secretariat 2019 as well as 
during the term of the BAC Chairperson from January to February 2020;  
 

b. The implementation of Malacañang Proclamation Nos. 922 and 928, S. 2020 
“Declaring a State of Public Health Emergency Throughout the Philippines”, and 
“Declaring a State of Calamity Throughout the Philippines”, respectively, placing 
the entire Luzon under the Enhanced Community Quarantine due to Covid-19 
pandemic from March 17, 2020 to May 31, 2020, prevented Management from 
physically reporting to the office. They informed that all documents/hard copies 
are in the Property and Supply Section; and  
 

c. The implemented alternative work arrangement limits the personnel to no more 
than 50 percent of the capacity to report at work in the office physically.  

 
Accordingly, for them to comply with the audit recommendations, the Property and 
Supply Section/BAC Secretariat will undertake the following courses of action:  

 
a. Prepare the list of ongoing PPAs that are ongoing and to be implemented during 

the year;  
 

b. Adhere to the guidelines prescribed in COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated 
February 12, 2009, on the submission of contracts and supporting documents 
within five days from the execution of a contract/purchase order, and to ensure  
complete compliance with the said Circular starting June 2021; and  
 

c. Submit a proposal for creating a BAC Secretariat Unit ensuring compliance with 
the COA rules and regulations and the efficient implementation of 
activities/processes regarding procurement and other matters related to 
Government procurement. 
 

Auditor‟s Rejoinder: 
 
The Audit Team will monitor the implementation of the audit recommendations. 
 

8. The non-compliance with pertinent rules and regulations in the recording, 
maintenance and utilization of Petty Cash Fund (PCF) granted to an Accountable 
Officer amounting to P30,000.00 has exposed the fund to the risk of loss and 
mishandling, and is contrary to Sections 35 and 36, Chapter 6 of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. 



49 
 

Moreover, expenses made out of the PCF amounting to P27,718.12 under List of 
Due and Demandable Accounts Payable-Advice to Debit Accounts (LDDAP-ADA) 
No. 101-101-04-106-2020 were not supported with adequate documentary 
requirements, contrary to Section 4(6) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and 
Section 1.2.2 of Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2012-001.  

 
Sections 35 and 36, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provide: 
 

“Sec. 35. Cash Advance for Petty Operating Expenses. The Petty 
Cash Fund (PCF) to be set up shall be sufficient for the recurring petty 
operating expenses of the agency for one month. It shall be maintained

the expense account and at all times, the PCF shall be equal to the total 
cash on hand and the unreplenished expenses. The PCF shall be 
replenished as soon as disbursements reach at least 75% or as needed. 
The following are the accounting policies regarding cash advance for 
PCF: 
 
a. The fund shall be kept separately from the regular cash 

advances/collections and shall not be used for payment of regular 
expenses such as rentals, subscriptions, light and water bills, 
purchase of supplies and materials for stock purposes, and the like. 
Payments out of PCF, which shall be made through a Petty Cash 
Voucher (PCV) (Appendix 48), should be allowed only for amounts 
not exceeding P15,000 for each transaction, except when a higher 
amount is allowed by law and/or specific authority by the COA. 
Splitting of transactions to avoid exceeding the ceiling shall not be 
allowed. All disbursements out of PCF shall be covered by duly 
accomplished and approved PCV supported by cash invoices, ORs or 
other evidence of disbursements; 

 
Sec. 36. Documentary Requirements. The documentary requirements 
for PCF as provided under COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14,

Annex A of COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020, is the Revised Chart of 
Accounts (Updated 2019) of the GAM for NGAs, which defines the following: 

 
“Petty Cash. This account is debited to recognize the amount granted to 
duly designated Petty Cash Custodian (PCC) for payment of authorized 
petty or miscellaneous expenses which cannot be conveniently paid 
through checks or Advice to Debit Account (ADA).   

 
Advances to Special Disbursing Officers. This account is debited to 
recognize the amount granted to agency‟s accountable officers and 
employees for special purpose/time-bound undertakings to be liquidated 
within a specified period. It also includes labor payroll for projects 
undertaken by administration.” 
 

Cash Examination conducted on the cash and accounts of the Accountable Officer on 
December 9, 2020, covering the period from March 2 to December 9, 2020, disclosed

a) PCF was incorrectly recorded as Advances to Special Disbursing Officers 
 
Audit of DV No. 202002000516 disclosed that the cash advance of  P30,000.00 was 
granted on March 2, 2020, to an Accountable Officer to defray expenses for emergency 
supplies and materials, mailing expenses, spare parts and accessories of vehicles and 
other Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) which cannot be purchased 
except on cash basis. The amount granted was recorded in the books as Advances to 
Special Disbursing Officer instead of PCF. This is considering that the cash advance 
was not for special purpose/time-bound undertakings to be liquidated within a specified 
period. 
 
Moreover, it was noted that the following documents were not attached to the said DV as 
documentary requirements for granting PCF as provided under COA Circular No. 2012-
001 and Section 36, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I: 
 

 Certification from the Accountant that previous cash advances have been 
liquidated and accounted for in the books; and 
 

 Copy of policy for maintaining PCF under the imprest system. 
 

b) replenishment was not made as soon as the disbursement reached at least 75 
percent, and disbursements include regular expenses not related to the purpose of 
the PCF; 

 
It was likewise observed during the cash count that the six paid PCVs or PCV nos. 15 to 
20 amounting to P26,498.92 or 88 percent of the total fund (Annex K) were not yet 
submitted to the Accounting for replenishment. The GAM clearly states that “The PCF 
shall be replenished as soon as disbursements reach at least 75% or as needed.” 
 
The PCF Custodian maintained Cash Disbursement Record instead of PCF Record 
(PCFR), in which the brief description of the nature of payment was not properly 
indicated.  

 
Moreover, review of PCV No. 2020-10-19 dated October 1, 2020, disclosed that Land 
Transportation Office (LTO) renewal registration of red plate vehicles amounting to 
P20,663.42 were paid out of the PCF. Due to the absence of policy for maintaining PCF 



52 
 

under the imprest system, the fund was used to defray expenses which was not 
considered emergency and petty expenses, but were classified as regular expenses and 
also not related to the purpose of the PCF, contrary to the provisions of Section 35.a, 
Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. Also, the disbursement exceeded the allowed 
amount per transaction of P15,000.00. 

 
c) PCFs granted was in excess of the monthly average expenses; 

 
The PCF Custodian prepared two replenishments of the fund for the disbursements from 
March 3 to July 30, 2020, or for five months, to wit:

Therefore, the PCF of P30,000.00 exceeded the one month requirement of P9,700.22, in 
violation of Section 35, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 
d) Payments and replenishments of expenses made out of the PCF were not supported 

with adequate documentary requirements, contrary to Section 1.2.2 of COA Circular 
No. 2012-001; 
 

Verification of the replenishment of the fund amounting to P27,718.12 under LDDAP-
ADA No. 101-101-04-106-2020 revealed that it was only supported by Obligation 
Request and Status, Report on Paid Petty Cash Vouchers (RPPCVs) and copy of the 
Cash Disbursement Record.  No other supporting documents were attached to 
determine the propriety and validity of the payments made.  This is contrary to Section 
1.2.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001. The details of the expenses are as follows:

Supplies 20,280.00  

   Total P27,718.12  

 
Replenishment of the fund was made when the disbursements reached 92 percent 
instead of at least 75 percent. It was also noted that payment under PCF Voucher No. 
2020-03-04 amounting to P20,280.00 for supplies expenses exceeded the allowed 
amount per transaction of P15,000.000, contrary to Section 35.a, Chapter 6 of GAM for 
NGAs, Volume I. 



53 
 

 
Result of post-audit of the Report on Paid Petty Cash Vouchers (RPPCVs) disclosed 
that purchases involving P1,000 and above were not supported with Request for 
Quotation to confirm the supplier with lowest quotation and Abstract of Canvass from at 
least three suppliers. Absence of the necessary documents like Request for Quotations 
and Abstract of Canvass affects the validity and propriety of the disbursements made 
and may signify weaknesses in the internal control over petty cash disbursements. 
Moreover, the date when the cash was received upon request and the date of 
submission of liquidation submitted or reimbursement received under Box D of the PCV 
were not duly accomplished. 
 
The granting of PCF for more than the one month requirement exposes the cash to 
possible loss or misuse, in which fund could have been used for other purpose/s. 
Additionally, had Management established policies concerning the use of PCF, the 
abovementioned audit observations could have been avoided. 
 
We recommended that Management: 
 

a. direct the Accountant to record in the books the accountability of the PCF 
Custodian under Petty Cash Fund, in accordance with the Revised Chart of 
Accounts (Updated 2019) of the GAM for NGAs; 
 

b. reassess the accurate amount of PCF and prepare a duly approved 
estimates of petty expenses to be incurred for one month, and establish 
policies concerning the use of PCF, in compliance with Section 36, Chapter 
6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I; 
 

c. require the PCF Custodian to strictly adhere to the existing government 
rules, regulations and policies on the handling of the PCF subject to the 
proper use and liquidation of the fund, and properly accomplish the Petty 
Cash Voucher and Petty Cash Fund Record, in accordance with 
Appendices 48 and 50 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II, and replenish the PCF 
once the disbursements reached 75 percent; 
 

d. instruct the PCF Custodian and the Accountant to refrain from charging 
regular expenses, pursuant to Section 35, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, 
Volume I and COA Circular No. 2012-001 and identify expenses that should 
be paid through checks;  
 

e. direct the PCF Custodian to ensure that the claims are supported with 
complete information/details and the liquidations are supported with 
complete documentations; and 
 

f. instruct the Accountant to submit the complete supporting documents on 
payments amounting to P27,718.12 under LDDAP-ADA No. 101-101-04-106-
2020 to facilitate the audit thereof. 
 
 
 
 
 



54 
 

Management‟s Comment: 
 
Management commented the following: 
 

a. From the time the cash advances were granted to the Accountable Officer, the 
recording of Advances to Special Disbursing Officer were based on the Authority 
of the Accountable Officer that were issued in prior years. The FPRDI has 
checklist of supporting documents in processing the disbursement. However, the 
Accountant overlooked the attachment of the certification that the previous cash 
advances have been liquidated and accounted for in the books. 

 
b. The cash advance was granted prior to the declaration of public health 

emergency and then followed by the declaration placing Luzon under Enhanced 
Community Quarantine (ECQ) which was stated on March 17, 2020, per 
Malacañang Proclamation Nos. 922 and 928, S. 2020. There were delays in the 
submission of the replenishment documents because the end-user/requesting 
party did not submit his/her corresponding supporting documents on time. Also, 
the Fund Custodian, who was transferred to the Property and Supply Section, 
was overwhelmed by the bulk of transaction especially towards the end of 2020. 

 
With regard to the use of the forms, the Fund Custodian was advised by the 2018 
Resident Auditor to use forms Appendix 40-Cash Disbursement Record and 
Appendix 49-Report on Paid Petty Cash Vouchers in recording transactions. 

 
With regard to the LTO matters, it has been the practice to renew the LTO 
registration of the RP or government owned vehicles through the said funds, as it 
is part of the scope of expenses based on the “Authority of the Accountable 
Officer issued by the Head of Agency”. The said document has been 
accomplished and attached as a requirement in the renewal of the fidelity bond at 
the Bureau of Treasury (BTr). 

 
With regard to the LTO registration expenses amounting to P20,663.42, these 
were composed of various RP vehicles that were not renewed on time. The LTO 
was on temporary suspension of operation due to Covid-19 pandemic. Also, 
there were delays on the releases of insurance policies from the Government 
Service and Insurance System (GSIS).  The insurance policies were required in 
renewing RP vehicle registration 

 
c. Per the understanding of the Fund Custodian, the matter regarding the monthly 

average expenses is not being mentioned under Section 35, Chapter 6 of GAM, 
Volume I. 

 
d. The said replenishment under LDDAP-ADA No. 101-101-04-106-2020 was 

processed through scanning of documents and sending the same via email 
during the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) Period. All the Accounting 
Staff were working from home. On the resumption of work in June 2020 under 
Alternative Work Arrangement (AWA), the supporting documents were 
unintentionally inserted in the Accounting’s copy. 

 
 



55 
 

Accordingly, to comply with the audit recommendations, the Accountant and the Fund 
Custodian will do the following: 

 
a. The Accountant will record the grant of cash advance to the PCF account; 

 
b. The Fund Custodian will assess the accurate amount of PCF based on the 

historical records; and 
 

c. The Fund Custodian will adhere to the policy pertaining to the handling of PCF.  
 

Moreover, the Accountant has submitted on May 31, 2021, the complete supporting 
documents pertaining to replenishment amounting to P27,718.12. 

 
Auditor‟s Rejoinder: 
 
Section 35, Chapter 6 of GAM, Volume I clearly states that the PCF to be set up shall be 
sufficient for the recurring petty operating expenses of the agency for one month. Based 
on the actual expenses charged to the Fund for the period of five months, the FPRDI’s 
one month requirement is P9,700.02.  
 
The Audit Team will review and verify the submitted supporting documents to determine 
the validity and propriety of the claim. 
 
Moreover, it was strictly recommended to create office policy on the proper use and 
liquidation of the PCF to identify the applicable expenses to be charged to the fund and 
avoid charging expenses that are considered regular in nature.

The existence, correctness and 
completeness of the Property, Plant 
and Equipment (PPE) with gross 
amount of P521,384,001.34 as of 
December 31, 2019 could not be 
fully ascertained due to the following: 
 

    

a) Unreconciled difference of 
P125,323,150.91 between 
accounting records and the 
submitted Report on the 
Physical Count of Property, 
Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) 
due to incomplete physical 
inventory-taking in CY 2019, and 
the presence of Other Subsidiary 
Ledger account balances are still 
for reconciliation with the PPE 
schedule maintained by the 
Accounting Section. This is 
contrary to Section 38, Chapter 
10 of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for 
National Government Agencies 
(NGAs), Volume I. 

We recommended that the Director 
direct the:   
 

a. Inventory Committee to:   
 

 complete the required physical 
count of all Property, Plant and 
Equipment of the FPRDI at least 
once a year, and to prepare and 
submit the Report on Physical 
Count of Property, Plant and 
Equipment (RPCPPE), in 
compliance with Section 38, 
Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, 
Volume I; and   

 

 ensure that reconciliation of the 
inventory count documented in the 

 
 
 
 
 
Partial physical count of all 
PPEs was conducted in 
November and December 
2020. 

 
 
 
 
 

Partially 
Implemented 

 
 
 
 
 
Physical count of PPEs 
and reconciliation of 
accounts were not 
finished because of the 
limited time and staff 
due to community 
quarantines 
implemented, agency 
lockdowns and 
implementation of 
alternative work 
arrangement.

RPCPPE with the records 
maintained by the Accounting 
Section is properly made, and any 
discrepancy be immediately 
verified and adjusted; 

 

b. Property Section to perform 
periodic reconciliation of actual 
PPE to property cards to ensure 
that all discrepancies are 
immediately investigated, cleared 
and reconciled with the 
accounting records; and 
 

Actual PPEs have their 
property cards as of 
December 31, 2020. 

Partially

Discrepancies between 
the records of the 
Accounting and 
Property Sections were 
not yet cleared. 

c. Accounting Section to conduct 
analysis of PPE accounts to 
identify and determine the 
composition of the undetermined 
PPEs under Other Subsidiary 
Ledger account balances, still for 
reconciliation amounting to 
P22,036,136.91, and prepare the 
necessary journal entries to adjust 
the duly investigated reconciling 
items in order to reflect the 
accurate account balances. 
 

 Not Implemented The Accountant was 
unable to conduct 
analysis and determine 
the composition of 
PPEs under the “for 
reconciliation” accounts 
due to the absence of 
records because these 
unreconciled amounts 
pertained to prior years 
in which no subsidiary 
ledgers were 
established by the 
previous Accountant. 
 

b) Depreciation was not provided 
for Building - Pilot Plant (Main) 
amounting to P1,093,136.00, 
contrary to Items e and i, Section 
27, Chapter 10 of  GAM for

c) Unserviceable PPEs with a total 
cost of P3,073,123.85,  which 
were already disposed of and 
sold at P58,550.00, were not 
derecognized in the books of 
accounts due to non-preparation 
of the corresponding Inventory 
and Inspection Report of 
Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) 
by the Property and Supply 
Section, contrary to Section 39, 
Chapter 10 of  GAM for NGAs, 
Volume I. 

We recommended that the Director 
instruct the:   
 
a. Property and Supply Section, in 

coordination with the Disposal 
Committee, to prepare and 
submit to the Accounting Section 
the corresponding IIRUP on the 
disposed properties and other 
supporting documents to prove

equal to Fifteen Percent 
(15%) of the total contract 
price”.  While in the 
second quarterly report for 
2019 submitted to the 
COA, it was stated that the 
construction was 
completed in May 2019.  A 
remark of “no report from 
the Consultant yet” for the 
detailed engineering 
activity of AC Ong was 
identified to show that the 
Consultant needs to 
prepare the report before 
the final payment will be 
processed. 
 
Even there is a lapse with 
AC Ong, the project team 
and the contractor 
managed to settle the

the last payment as 
stipulated in the contract. 
 
Also, as stated in Item 5, 
Article V, “No final

accounts. 

The Project Engineer 
retrieved the records 
relative to the remaining 
project but failed to 
forward the same to the 
Accounting Section for 
recording.

adjustments of P2,083,921.84.  This 
is contrary to the Revised Chart of 
Accounts (RCA) of GAM for NGAs, 
Volume III. Likewise, the said 
balances were unremitted to the 
National Treasury, which is not in 
accordance with Section 2 of 
Executive Order (EO) No. 338, 
series of 1996 and Section 3, 
Chapter 5 of GAM for NGAs, Volume 
I. 

We recommended that the Director 
instruct the Accountant to:   
 
a. ensure that collection of testing 

fees are recorded in the books 
under Other Services Income 
account in accordance with the 
Revised Chart of Accounts per 
GAM for NGAs, Volume III; 

 
 
 
The FPRDI has been 
recording the collection of 
testing fees as income 
since it was raised as an 
AOM in 2015. 

 
 
 

Fully 
Implemented 

 

b. review and analyze prior period’s 
income to facilitate adjustment in 
the books of accounts and ensure 
that the journal entry to properly 
record the said transaction is 
supported with complete and 
valid documents to facilitate 
remittance of collections to the 
National Treasury; and 
 

Prior years’ collections of 
testing fees recorded 
under the Other Payable 
Accounts were already 
adjusted in the books.  

Partially 
Implemented 

The testing fees 
recorded under the Due 
to NGAs account, are 
not yet adjusted due to 
incomplete detail. 

c. remit in full the balance of 
P2,083,921.84 representing prior 
years’ collections of testing fees, 
in compliance with EO No. 338 
and Section 3, Chapter 5 of GAM 
for NGAs, Volume I, otherwise, 
seek authority from the 
Permanent Committee to 
maintain a separate account, in 
conformity with Section 4, 
Chapter 5 of the same Manual.  
 

Prior years’ collections of 
testing fees in the amount 
of P1,497,799.40 was 
remitted to the National 
Treasury per JEV No. 
2020-12-001961 dated 
December 11, 2020. 

Partially

The validity and regularity of 
expenses for meals and snacks 
amounting to P353,247.24 could not 
be fully assessed as the billing 
statements does not provide 
information on the number of 
persons entertained and the details 
of the menu served,  casting doubts  
on the propriety and regularity of the 
transaction. This is also contrary to 
Section 4.6 of PD No. 1445 and 
COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated 
June 14, 2012. 

We recommended that the 
Accounting Section comply with the 
aforementioned provisions of PD No. 
1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-
001, strengthen controls in the 
disbursement of fund and refrain from 
paying expenses that are not properly 
documented.   
 
Also, require the concerned officials 
to submit billing statements with the 
complete information as to the 
number of packs delivered for 
expenses amounting to P353,247.24 
for audit purposes.  Otherwise, the 
Notice of Suspension (NS) will be 
issued by the Audit Team, in 
accordance with the Rules and 
Regulations on Settlement of Account 
(RRSA) prescribed under COA 
Circular No. 2009-006. 
 

The Accounting Section 
implemented controls in 
the disbursements 
especially the completion 
of documents before 
processing of payments. 
 
 
 
 
Revised billing statements 
with complete detail were 
submitted to the Audit 
Team Leader on 
November 21, 2020.
