Only the first quarter target was realized in January until before the lockdown 

in March 2020. The museums remained closed because of the prevailing COVID-19 

problem. National events were held with only a handful of guests, following safety 

protocols. It also limited the conduct of public programs and downscaled 

commemorative activities.  During the third quarter, activities were webinars and 

lectures that were held online.

propriety of transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules 

and regulations; c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and d) determine 

the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.  Moreover, the 

audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 

Institutions (ISSAIs).

The Auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of 

the financial statements of NHCP as at December 31, 2020. 

             

 

F. Summary of Other Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The significant audit observations and corresponding recommendations were 

discussed with Management officials concerned during the exit conference on April 

27, 2021, details of which are discussed in this report.  Management views and 

comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

 

1. The accounts Merchandise Inventory and the Printing and Publication Expenses 
were understated by P1,352,194 and P121,683.45, respectively, with 

corresponding overstatement of accounts Other Assets and Accounts Payable 

by P1,378,777.89 and P95,100.00, respectively, due to the deficiency in the 

recording of delivered printed publications and their corresponding issuances.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a. Chief Accountant to draw a Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to adjust the 

recording of the printed publications delivered in CY 2020, as well as their 

issuance for the year; and 

 

b. Property Officer and the Chief Accountant to reconcile their records 

periodically. 

 

2. Errors in the computation of depreciation of the NHCP building and its 
renovation resulted in (a) understated accumulated depreciation of 

P2,775,124.86. Moreover, deficiencies were noted in property management, 

such as (b) non-provision of depreciation for rescue and communication 

equipment and furniture and fixtures totaling P750,861.38, and (c) inclusion of 



v 

 

rare books in the PPE under the account Books instead of heritage assets under 

the account Works of Arts and Archeological Specimens totaling P127,040.00. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the:  

  

a. Chief Accountant to make the necessary correcting entries to reflect the 

correct balance of the affected accounts; 

 

b. Chief Accountant to provide depreciation on the undepreciated rescue and 

communication equipment and furniture and fixtures; and 

 

c. Historic Sites and Education Division (HSED) to assess and ensure that the 

books are indeed “rare”; hence, should be reclassified into the account 

Works of Arts and Archeological Specimen. 

 

3. Various deficiencies in the recording of transactions pertaining to performance 
bonds and retention fees resulted in the understatement of Guaranty/Security 

Deposits Payable by P625,401.95, Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust by 

P74,242.74 and, Cumulative Surplus/(Deficit) by a net of P551,159.21. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

 

a. prepare the necessary adjustments to reflect the correct balances of the 

affected accounts;  

 

b. send a demand letter to Print Depot and FFJJ Construction for the refund of 

the overpayment they received totaling P42,338.84 and P600,770.49, 

respectively;  

    

c. coordinate with Albeva Konstrukt for the possibility of processing the 

retention fee P186,868.75 where the unrecouped advance payment of 

P128,178.29 could be deducted from; and 

 

d. henceforth, adequate internal control and monitoring measures must be 

provided to prevent the incurrence of the deficiencies noted. 

 

4. The accuracy and reliability of the Other Payables account with a balance of 
P1,151,444.53 as of December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained due to the (a) 

absence of Subsidiary Ledger (SL) or schedule to support the recorded balance; 

(b) non-adjustment of cancelled checks and over-remittance of payment of 

salary loans amounting to P37,633.84 and P74,504.01, respectively; and (c) the 

other payables-trust fund reported an abnormal balance of P184,523.03.  

 

 

 



vi 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

 

a. prepare the necessary adjusting entry to record the cancelled checks; 

 

b. deduct from the salaries of the concerned employees the over remittance of 

payment of their salary loans; and 

 

c. review the unremitted payments for salary loans of retired/separated NHCP 

employees and refund the amount to them or remit to NHCP Employees 

Association (NHCPEA) accordingly. 

 

5. Non-availability of educational materials in various media deprives 
stakeholders, and the public as well, of a wider dissemination of Philippine 

history information, inconsistent with Section 5 of RA No. 10086, resulting in 

possible loss of income.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require Research, Publications 

and Heraldry Division (RPHD) in coordination with the information technology 

personnel, to have a publication section in the official website of NHCP and its 

social media account containing detailed information or visual catalog of 

available publications of the Commission that will serve as a venue in 

disseminating information on Philippine history pursuant to its mandate.   

 

 

G. Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 

Of the 38 audit recommendations contained in the prior year’s Annual Audit 

Report (AAR), 31 were implemented and 7 were not implemented.  The details are 

presented in Part III of this report.
