OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

A. Financial Audit 
 

Understated Merchandise Inventory  

 

1. The accounts Merchandise Inventory and the Printing and Publication 
Expenses were understated by P1,352,194 and P121,683.45, respectively, with 

corresponding overstatement of accounts Other Assets and Accounts Payable 

by P1,378,777.89 and P95,100.00, respectively, due to the deficiency in the 

recording of delivered printed publications and their corresponding issuances.   

 

The Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA), Volume III of the GAM describes the 

account Merchandise Inventory as used to recognize cost of goods 

purchased/acquired/produced which are intended for sale in the ordinary course of 

business. This includes forest products and other merchandise. Credit this account 

for the sale, transfers or write-down of merchandise inventory.  

 

On the other hand, Printing and Publication Expenses is used to recognize the 

costs of printing and binding of manuscripts/documents, forms, manuals, brochures, 

pamphlets, and the like. This account shall be closed to the Revenue and Expense 

Summary account. 

 

One of the mandates of NHCP is to conduct research, produce materials in 

various media and publish and disseminate historical works. Following its mandate, 

publications are made available to the public through sale or as complimentary.  

 

Publications are recorded as Merchandise Inventory, while the issuances, either 

through sale or as complimentary, are recorded at cost using account Printing and 

Publication Expenses.  

 

Analysis of the account Merchandise Inventory showed that the printed Museo 

ng Pampangulong Sasakyan, received in CY 2020 amounting to P1,378,777.89 was 

recorded under the account Other Assets instead of Merchandise Inventory, while the 

Journal of Philippine History and Heritage amounting to P95,100.00 was not 

recorded at all; consequently, the issuance of the said publications were not taken up 

in the books.

 The non-recording of the delivery and issuance of the printed publications 

understated the accounts Merchandise Inventory and Printing and Publication 

Expenses (PPExp) by P1,352,194.44 and P121,683.45, respectively, and overstated 

the accounts Other Assets and Accounts Payable by P1,378,777.89 and P95,100.00, 

respectively, with the following details:

Further verification of the balances of the Stock Card (SC) maintained by the 

Property and Supply Section disclosed that it did not tally with the balances of the 

Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) of the Accounting Section, contrary to Section 17, 

Chapter 8, Volume II of the GAM, to wit: 

 

Stock Card (SC) shall be used to record all receipts and issues of 

supplies and the balance in quantity at any time. It shall be 

maintained by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit for each 

item in stock.  

 

Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) shall be used to record materials 

received, issued and the balance both in quantity and amount at any 

time. It shall be maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit for 

each kind of and materials.  

 

The balance per stock cards should always reconcile with the ledger cards of 

the Accounting unit. 



    
32 

 

 

Per inquiry, it was claimed that in the actual count of books during the adoption 

of eNGAS, some of the books maintained in the Museum were inadvertently not 

included in the count, and some books might not have been recorded as merchandise 

inventory; hence, the discrepancy. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a. Chief Accountant to draw a JEV to adjust the recording of the printed 
publications delivered in CY 2020, as well as their issuance for the year; 

and 

 

b. Property Officer and the Chief Accountant to reconcile their records 
periodically. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

As partial compliance with the audit recommendations, the Accounting Section 

prepared Journal Entry Voucher Nos. 2021-02-000659 and 2021-02-000675 for the 

unrecorded NHCP publications titled "Museo ng Pampangulong Sasakyan" and 

"Journal of Philippine Local History and Heritage, Volume 5 No. 1", respectively. 

While, journal entries for the Issuances of the said books will be made not later than 

May 31, 2021. 

 

Further, Accounting and Property Sections are being required to conduct 

monthly reconciliation of their records to minimize misstatements in the financial 

reports. 

 

 

Deficiencies in property management 

 

2. Errors in the computation of depreciation of the NHCP building and its 
renovation resulted in (a) understated accumulated depreciation of 

P2,775,124.86. Moreover, deficiencies were noted in property management, 

such as (b) non-provision of depreciation for rescue and communication 

equipment and furniture and fixtures totaling P750,861.38, and (c) inclusion of 

rare books in the PPE under the account Books instead of heritage assets under 

the account Works of Arts and Archeological Specimens totaling P127,040.00. 
 

 

(a) Erroneous computation of depreciation of NHCP building 
 

Section 27, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM provides, among others, that 

depreciation of asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the 

location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner 

intended by Management. The depreciation of an asset does not cease when the asset 



    
33 

 

becomes idle or is retired from active use and held for disposal unless the asset is 

fully depreciated. Further, Depreciation shall be recognized on a monthly basis.  

 

Verification of the depreciation charges of the NHCP Building and its 

corresponding renovation showed a total of P69,947,715.67  and P856,189.06, 

respectively, as at December 31, 2020.  Recalculation showed that their accumulated 

depreciation was understated by P2,411,990.75 and P363,134.11, respectively, as 

shown below:  

 

Description Acquisition 

Cost (P) 

Accumulated Depreciation (P) Under(P)

 Total 140,960,343.38 70,803,904.73 73,579,029.59 2,775,124.86 

 

The NHCP building, with an estimated useful life of 50 years and 10 percent 

salvage value, recorded its first depreciation on February 28, 2011 for the period 

January 1991 to February 2011 or 20 years and 2 months.  However, the recorded 

amount of depreciation was computed at only 19 years and 2 months or an 

unrecorded one-year depreciation. 

 

On the other hand, the renovation of the NHCP building that was completed 

on March 10, 2016 was computed a depreciation based on a useful life, which is two 

years and seven months more than the estimated useful life of the NHCP building 

itself. 

 

The errors in the computation of depreciation resulted in the understatement of 

the Depreciation charges - Buildings by P1,681.83 and Accumulated Depreciation-

Buildings by P2,775,124.86 and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit by P2,773,443.03. 

 

 

(b) Non-provision of depreciation 
 

Further verification of the depreciation charges disclosed that the following 

equipment, which had already served their useful lives, were not provided with 

depreciation since their acquisition; hence, their Accumulated Depreciation was 

understated by P750,861.38 :

(c) Inclusion of heritage items in the account Books 
 

The account Books included the following books, which are claimed by 

Management as “rare”, costing P127,040.00. If indeed “rare”, these should have 

been treated as heritage assets under the account Works of Arts and Archeological 

Specimens, in conformity with Section 30, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM on 

Heritage Assets:

The RCA, Volume III of the GAM describes the account Works of Arts and 

Archeological Specimens as used to recognize works of arts and archeological 

specimens held by an agency for their cultural or historical significance. Included in 

this account are monuments and memorials erected to commemorate persons or 

events, sculptures, archeological sites, and other works of arts. 

 

On the other hand, Section 30, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM defines 

heritage assets as those assets which have historical, cultural and environmental 

significance, and are intended to be preserved in trust for future generations.  It also 

states that among its characteristics are (a) they are often irreplaceable and their 

value may increase over time, even if their physical condition deteriorates and (b) it 

may be difficult to estimate their useful lives, which in some cases could be several 

hundred years.

We recommended and Management agreed to require the:  

  

a. Chief Accountant to make the necessary correcting entries to reflect the 
correct balance of the affected accounts; 

 

b. Chief Accountant to provide depreciation on the undepreciated rescue 
and communication equipment and furniture and fixtures; and 

 

c. HSED to assess and ensure that the books are indeed “rare”; hence, 
should be reclassified into the account Works of Arts and Archeological 

Specimen. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

NHCP Management agree with the audit recommendations and require the 

Accounting Section to implement corrective actions until 31 July 2021. 

 
 

Understated Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable  

 

3. Various deficiencies in the recording of transactions pertaining to performance 
bonds and retention fees resulted in the understatement of Guaranty/Security 

Deposits Payable by P625,401.95, Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust by 

P74,242.74 and, Cumulative Surplus/(Deficit) by a net of P551,159.21. 

 

RCA, Volume III of the GAM describes Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable 

as account used to recognize the incurrence of liability arising from the 

receipt/withholding of cash or cash equivalents to guaranty (a) that the winning 

bidder shall enter into contract with the procuring entity; (b) performance by the 

contractor of the terms of the contract; and (c) that the contractor shall correct all 

discovered defects and clear/settle all third party liabilities. This account is debited 

for refund after the fulfillment of the purpose of the bond or forfeiture upon failure 

to comply with the purpose of the bond/retention, and/or adjustments. 

 

As provided for in Section 38(g), Chapter 5, Volume I of the GAM, receipts 

of performance bond/security deposits posted by contractor or supplier to guaranty 

full and faithful performance of their contract are to be recorded under the account 

Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust, and with recognition of a liability under 

Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable. 

 

Verification of the transactions pertaining to performance bonds and retention 

fees showed that the balance of the account Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable of 

P21,021,811.84 as at December 31, 2020 was understated by P625,401.95 resulting 

from the following recording deficiencies:

Total   625,401.95 74,242.74 600,770.49 (49,611.28)  

 

Out of the five contractors/service providers in the preceding Table, it was 

verified that a retention fee totaling P186,868.75 for various projects conducted in  

year 2009 was not yet refunded to Albeva Konstrukt. However, it also has an 

unrecouped advance payment of P128,178.29 for the contract that was rescinded due 

to his poor performance. 

 

No explanation was offered by Management for the incurrence of 

overpayments of performance bonds and retention fee, which is a sign of negligence 

and lack of monitoring in the disbursement of public funds. 

 

It must be remembered that, it is the declared policy of the State that all 

resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in 

accordance with law and regulations, and safeguard against loss or wastage 

through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, 

economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. (Section 2, PD 

No. 1445) 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

 

a. prepare the necessary adjustments to reflect the correct balances of the 
affected accounts;  

 

b. send a demand letter to Print Depot and FFJJ Construction for the refund 
of the overpayment they received totaling P42,338.84 and P600,770.49, 

respectively;  

    

c. coordinate with Albeva Konstrukt for the possibility of processing the 
retention fee P186,868.75 where the unrecouped advance payment of 

P128,178.29 could be deducted from; and 

 

d. henceforth, adequate internal control and monitoring measures must be 
provided to prevent the incurrence of the deficiencies noted. 



    
38 

 

 

Management Comment: 

NHCP adheres with the audit recommendations and commits to implement all 

corrective actions on or before June 30, 2021. Initially, the Accounting Section 

prepared JEVs to reflect the correct balance of the account. 

 

The overpayment to FFJJ Construction of P600,770.49 will be deducted from 

its succeeding billings while a letter to Print Depot will be sent requesting for the 

refund of P42,338.84. 

 

Further analysis will be done to determine if the outstanding performance 

bonds, retention money and bid securities are still due for refund or maybe forfeited 

and remitted to BTr.  
 

 

Unreliable Other Payables account balance 

 

4. The accuracy and reliability of the Other Payables account with a balance 
of P1,151,444.53 as of December 31, 2020 could not be ascertained due to the (a) 

absence of Subsidiary Ledger (SL) or schedule to support the recorded balance; 

(b) non-adjustment of cancelled checks and over-remittance of payment of 

salary loans amounting to P37,633.84 and P74,504.01, respectively; and (c) the 

other payables-trust fund reported an abnormal balance of P184,523.03. 

 

 

The SL stores the details or breakdown of the balance of the controlling 

account appearing in the GL. The purpose of keeping SLs is for accuracy and 

efficiency. The totals of the SL balances should be reconciled with their respective 

control account regularly to ensure the accuracy of the two records. 

 

The Other Payables of P1,151,444.53 is composed of the following: 

 

Other Payables Balance (P) 

RA Fund 1,335,967.56 

Trust Fund (184,523.03) 

Total 1,151,444.53 

 

The RA Fund consist of amounts withheld from salaries of officers and 

employees for remittance to National Historical Institute Employees Association 

Cooperative (NHIEACO), National Historical Commission of the Philippines 

Employees Association (NHCPEA), National Historical Commission of the 

Philippine Health and Welfare Plan (NHCPHWP), National Housing Mortgage 

Finance Corporation (NHMFC) and University of the Philippines (UP) Provident 

Fund as payment for their loans and contributions. While the Trust Fund are 

proceeds from the sale of bid documents. 



    
39 

 

 

Verification of the current transactions disclosed an unrecorded cancellation 

of two checks, Nos. 2380901 and 2389793 dated February 28, 2020 and October 20, 

2020, respectively, both amounting to P18,816.92 pertaining to monthly dues, 

resulting in understatement of the account by P37,633.84.  

 

 Likewise, a schedule of over-remittances to NHCPWP out of the pay 

deductions for the payment of salary loans of NHCP personnel totaled P74,504.01, 

further understating the Other Payables. The details are shown below: 

 

Period

 CY 2020 0.00 2,087.00 2,087.00 

   74,504.01 

 

It was further uncovered that a total of P89,284.69 for the payment of salary 

loans of NHCP personnel who were already retired/separated as of August 2020 

were still unremitted to NHCPEA. 

 

These observations casted doubt on the accuracy and reliability of the other 

payables, however, we could not validate the year-end balance of P1,335,967.56 and 

(P184,523.03) or a net of P1,151,444.53, which consisted of amounts from five years 

or more ago since there was no schedule to substantiate it. Further, the balance of 

P1,335,967.56 included a lumped amount of P1,249,547.74, which according to the 

Accountant could not be accounted for since no SL could be found; thus, precluded 

the Audit Team from further review. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

 

a. prepare the necessary adjusting entry to record the cancelled checks; 
 

b. deduct from the salaries of the concerned employees the over remittance 

of payment of their salary loans; and 

c. review the unremitted payments for salary loans of retired/separated 
NHCP employees and refund the amount to them or remit to creditors 

accordingly. 

  

 

 



    
40 

 

Management Comment: 

 

NHCP adheres with the audit recommendations and commits to implement all 

corrective actions on or before June 30, 2021. Initially, the Accounting Section 

prepared JEV Nos. 2021-02-0630 and 2021-02-648 for the adjustment of cancelled 

checks.  

 

Immediately after the on-going reconciliation of SL, NHCP will include the 

succeeding remittance to NHEACO the unremitted payments of salary loans net of 

over remittances. 

 

Further, NHCP will exert best efforts to find old references for the 

reconciliation of the long outstanding unaccounted balance of the account. 

 

 

B. Compliance Audit 
 

Educational materials not available in various media 

 

5. Non-availability of educational materials in various media deprives 
stakeholders, and the public as well, of a wider dissemination of Philippine 

history information, inconsistent with Section 5 of RA No. 10086, resulting in 

possible loss of income.  

 

Section 5 of RA 10086 provides the general mandate of NHCP, which is the 

primary government agency responsible for history and has the authority to 

determine all factual matters relating to Philippine history. In this regard, NHCP 

shall, among others: 

 

a. Conduct and support all kind of research relating to Philippine national and 
local history; and 

 

b. Develop educational materials in various media, implement historical 
educational activities for the popularization of Philippine History, and 

disseminate information regarding Philippine Historical events, dates, 

places and personages. 

 

The purpose of developing educational materials in various media is to reach 

a larger number of Filipinos for the dissemination of information on Philippine 

history. It is commendable that the Commission integrates various media into its 

museums that are located in the different parts of the country as venues for learning. 

They also serve as bookstores of the educational materials published by the agency.   

 

However, verification on the NHCP website showed that the Publication 

Section, which should contain information or visual catalog of publications of 

NHCP, is not available. Further verification also revealed that its social media 



    
41 

 

account does not post any information on the available publications, which could 

have supplemented its official website for additional target population by which 

historical information can be disseminated. 

 

As the country focuses on digitization, publications should not be limited to 

printed copies. It should also be made available through electronic copies as another 

form of media supplementing the increasing demand for electronic books.  

 

It was noted that there are already some publications that were converted to e-

books but information on their availability are not posted in the website of the 

agency nor in its social media account. 

 

For the years 2019 and 2020, NHCP published 11,500 copies of new books 

and issued a total of 1,787 copies through sale or as complimentary. Details are as 

follows:

The low inventory turn-over rate may signify that only limited number of 

people have knowledge on the publications of NHCP that are available for sale; thus, 

may also result in possible loss of income.  

 

It can be noted that the museums, which serve as the bookstores of printed 

publications, are closed for preventive measures due to pandemic. The NHCP should 

then take advantage of the different online platforms to ensure the widest 

dissemination of information on Philippine history and rekindle the Filipino spirit 
through the lessons of history. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require RPHD in 

coordination with the information technology personnel, to have a publication 

section in the official website of NHCP and its social media account containing 

detailed information or visual catalog of available publications of the 

Commission that will serve as a venue in disseminating information on 

Philippine history pursuant to its mandate.   

 

Management informed the Audit Team further, during the exit conference, that 

they will require the Information Technology Section to post the available 

publications that were converted to e-books without the need of a service provider. 

They might also go into on-line selling wherein the buyer will shoulder the delivery 

costs.

Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Programs  

 

9. NHCP had formulated a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues for FY 
2020 through integration in the Agency’s regular activities and spent a total cost 

of P5,733,200.00, which represents 1.83 percent of the agency’s appropriation 

of P313,408,458.00. 

 

Section 31 of the General Provisions (GP) of the General Appropriations Act 

(GAA) of FY 2020 (RA No. 11465) requires all agencies of the government to 

formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned 

sectors or mandate. The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 

agencies, which shall be at least five percent of their budgets.  

 

For CY 2020, the actual expenses incurred by NHCP for its GAD activities 

totaled P5,733,200.00 or 1.83 percent of the agency’s appropriation of 

P313,408,458.00.  Due to pandemic, some programmed activities were cancelled.  

 

The following GAD activities were conducted: 

 

1) Participation in the Women’s Month Celebration and International 
Women’s Day. 

 

2) Conduct of seminar/webinar/exhibit on arts and crafts making using old and 
unused fabrics; water sanitation and sustainability, women’s role in the 

society in the early 18th and 19th century colonial period, mental health and 

Gawad Manlilikha ng Bayan. 

   

3) Employment of a percentage of women and assignment to men-dominated 
work activities - 10 percent of  employed heritage workers on partial 

restoration of EDSA People Power Monument were female; 

 



    
45 

 

4) Incorporation of training modules that address the improvement of women 
status and welfare through online/webinar such as basic conservation on 

museum environment monitoring and object deterioration; packing, display 

and object storage; how cultural workers act in times of crisis and preventive 

conservation for museum objects; 

 

5) Training workshop on-site on stone conservation; and 
 

6) Conduct of health, wellness and medical protection programs such as free 
flu and pneumococcal vaccine to all employees; face masks, alcohol, 

Vitamin C; provision of sleeping quarters for employees who cannot go 

home to their residences under ECQ, MECQ or GCQ areas. 

 

 

Programs and Projects Related to Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability (PWD) 

 

10. For CY 2020, NHCP and the Rotary Club of San Juan del Monte undertook an 
educational program for the blind and PWDs through the provision of tactile 

models and Braille captions/text for NHCP museums.  

 

Section 32 of the GP of the GAA of FY 2020 (RA No. 11465) provides that all 

agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to 

address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates 

to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities. 

 

The NHCP and the Rotary Club of San Juan del Monte undertook an 

educational program for the blind and differently-abled Filipinos through the 

provision of tactile models and Braille captions/text for NHCP museums through a 

Memorandum of Agreement in 2018. The Rotary Club of San Juan del Monte agreed 

to shoulder all the expenses in the production of tactile models and Braille text as 

well as the installation in the designated galleries of NHCP museums.  In CYs 2018 

and 2019, a total of 10 museums were provided with the program. In CY 2020, two 

museums was provided with the tactile models and Braille text.  

  

 

Compliance with Disaster Risk Reduction and Management and Climate Change 

Adaptation and Mitigation 

 

11. In compliance with Section 36 of the GP of the GAA of FY 2020 (RA No. 11465), 
which requires that all agencies of the government shall plan and implement 

programs and projects, taking into consideration measures for climate change 

adaptation and mitigation, and disaster risk reduction, based on climate and disaster 

risk assessment, the reported activities of the Commission in their museums and 

restoration projects for climate change adaptation and mitigation are the following: 

 



    
46 

 

1) Possible placement of solar panels on areas of the Quezon Memorial 
Shrines, Quezon City for an alternative electricity source is under 

consideration; 

 

2) The Department of Energy (DOE) is studying the potential of methane gas 
deposits in the El Deposito reservoir as potential renewable energy source; 

 

3) Rain water harvesting and solar power system for the restoration of Cape 
San Agustin Lighthouse; and 

 

4) Landscaping works for the restoration of Bahay na Bato, Jose B. Lingad 
Museum and Park, and Barasoain Church Historical Landmark 

 

For CY 2020, the NHCP was not able to conduct disaster preparedness 

activities due to pandemic.  However, because of the Taal Volcano eruption in 

January 2020, wherein three museums are located in towns of Taal and Tanauan and 

affected by the eruption, NHCP came up with Disaster Risk Reduction 

recommendations. 

 

Among others, the recommendations are as follows: 

 

1) A more in-depth Disaster Risk Mitigation and Management (DRMM) plan 
per museum per cluster should be devised and once crafted and approved, 

these should be coordinated and put into practice in an annual basis; 

 

2) Should form a core team which would oversee trainings and other crucial 
requirements for an effective DRMM plan; and 

 

3) Capacity building through the Material Research Conservation Division 
(MRCD)/DRMM group for museum personnel during times of calamities 

and natural occurrences shall be taken in consideration as opportunities for 

learning.

12. For CY 2020, the taxes withheld from gross compensation income of employees and
