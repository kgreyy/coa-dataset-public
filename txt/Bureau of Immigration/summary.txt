D)	Independent Auditor’s Report



The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the BI as at December 31, 2020.



E)	Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations 



1)	The balance of Cash-Collecting Officers account amounting to ₱58,963,127.95 as at year-end was unreliable due to: a) presence of negative Subsidiary Ledger balances in the aggregate amount of  ₱14,114,436.65;  b) inclusion of the accounts of former Collecting Officers (COs) totaling ₱9,501,388.07; and c) unadjusted amount of ₱10,021.96 contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020, Volume III, Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) 2019 for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Section 69 of PD 1445 and Paragraph 32, Chapter 2 of the Revised Cash Examination Manual (RCEM). (Observation No. 1)



We recommended that Management: a) require the Accounting Section to make a thorough analysis on the negative SL balances amounting to ₱14,114,436.65 and make necessary adjustments, if warranted; and require all COs to regularly reconcile their records with that of the Accounting Section to come up with correct/accurate balance; b) intensify efforts to collect accountabilities of former COs in the total amount of ₱9,501,388.07 and/or initiate appropriate remedies to recover the same. Inasmuch as the accounts of inactive COs are no longer reflective of the account, reclassify the amount of ₱8,219,952.16 to Due from Officers and Employees account and those of the resigned/retired/dismissed/deceased COs in the amount of ₱1,281,435.91 to the account of Other Receivables or request for write off of dormant receivables from COA, if warranted; c) make a thorough analysis and validations of the amount “for adjustment” of ₱10,021.96 and make adjusting entries to correct the account balance.



2)	The accuracy of the Cash in Bank account balance of ₱863,101,527.01 as at year-end  is unreliable due to discrepancies between the balances per books and per bank which could be attributed to: a) delayed preparation or non-submission of Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) contrary to Sections 5 and 7, Chapter 21, GAM Volume I; b) non-cancellation of stale checks aggregating ₱161,928.52 which is not in conformity with Section 44, Chapter 6 of GAM Volume I and Treasury Circular No. 03-2017 dated 20 October 2017; and c) non-recording of book reconciling items totaling ₱8,098,582.95 under LBP CA No. 0012-1046-18. (Observation No. 2)



We recommended that Management require the: a) Accounting Section (AS) to submit the 16 BRS for Account No. 3401-0379-68 covering the period September 2019 to December 2020; b) Cashier to cancel checks totaling ₱161,928.52; and     c) AS to record the ₱8,098,582.95 book reconciling items of LBP CA No. 0012-1046-18 and cancellation of checks.



3)	Despite issuance of DOJ Department Order Circular No. 026 dated June 1, 2016 revoking the April 12, 1999 BI Memorandum Circular, administrative fines from 2017 to 2020 totaling ₱1,068,000.00 were not collected. (Observation No. 3)



We recommended that Management require the Accounting Section to exert diligent efforts to collect the administrative fines from the airline companies and apply proper or legal remedies to settle their accountabilities, if warranted.





4)	The balances of Other Receivables and Due from Officers and Employees, and Accounts Receivable accounts of ₱7,427,867.73, ₱1,108,794.11, and  ₱101,099.00 respectively, have been outstanding for more than five years due to failure of Management to monitor the accounts and pursue its collection from concerned personnel and LGUs. (Observation No. 4)



We recommended that Management: a) require the concerned officials/employees to settle their accountabilities, otherwise, deduct from their salaries their unsettled accounts until full recovery of the amount; b) require the Accounting Section to exert extra efforts to locate documents pertaining to outstanding receivables; and   c) send demand letters to concerned LGUs for immediate settlement of their accounts.



5)	The balance of Due from National Government Agencies account of ₱14,422,637.07 as of December 31, 2020 is doubtful due to unreconciled discrepancy of ₱3,923,159.33 between the balance per books and that of the implementing agencies contrary to Section 7.1 and 7.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005, Section 3.1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012 – 001, Section 4.9 of COA Circular No. 94 – 013, GAM and PD 1445, thus, affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended that Management: a) direct the Accounting Section to immediately reconcile their records with the Procurement Service – Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM); b) require the Supply/Property Office and the Accounting Section to coordinate and record transactions accurately; c) require the PS-DBM to return or refund the unspent/unutilized balance of ₱10,417,422.80 for subsequent remittance to the BTr in conformity with Section 3.1.3 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and Section 4.9 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994; and  d) direct the Accounting Section and the Supply/Property Office to exert efforts to locate records and documents to support the unaccounted amounts pertaining to prior years’ transactions under the accounts of Bureau Of Customs, Bureau of Internal Revenue, Bureau of the Treasury and PS-DBM. 



6)	The year-end balance of Inventory account amounting to ₱22,965,943.96 was misstated due to: a) unreconciled difference of ₱209,017,071.32 between the General Ledger (GL) and Supplies Ledger Cards (SLC) balances; b) unrecorded issuance of office supplies and accountable forms; c) outright recording of procured items amounting to ₱21,428,303.50 as expenses instead of inventory; and d) presence of negative amounts in SLCs totaling ₱1,457,006.71 contrary to Appendices 5 and 6 of the GAM Volume II, Section 2a, Chapter 2 of GAM Volume I and Section 9, Chapter 8 of GAM Volume I; thus, affecting the fair presentation of the account in the financial statements.   Moreover, other deficiencies noted include: (a) non-maintenance of complete Stock Cards (SC) and SLCs; (b) incomplete supporting documents for issuances and adjustments of inventory items; and (c) delayed/non-submission of Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI). (Observation No. 6)



We recommended that Management: a) require the Accounting Section to: i) update the SLCs of various inventory accounts and make necessary adjustments, if warranted, to reconcile with the balance with the GL; ii) record/recognize the transactions promptly on the date they occur and make proper adjusting entry for the error committed in adjusting the unrecorded issuances of office supplies and accountable forms in the total amount of ₱4,636,015.02; and iii) refrain from recording purchases of supplies and material and other items as outright expenses. Regular purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account; b) require the Supply/Property Section to submit approved RSMI and RIS in the total amount of ₱25,395,557.78, and for future issuances of inventories, approved RSMI and RIS must be attached to the JEV. Disclosure/information must be stated for reference purposes; c) direct the AS to update the SLC for all inventory accounts and the Property Officer to maintain SC for all types of inventories and regularly reconcile their records;  and d) direct the concerned officials/Inventory Committee to conduct a complete physical count of all inventories regularly and submit the report thereon to the Office of the Auditor not later than July 31 for the semestral report ending June 30 and January 31 of the ensuing year for the semestral report ending December 31. 



7)	The accuracy of the PPE accounts balance of ₱1,327,193,490.56 as of December 31, 2020 cannot be relied upon due to: a) unreconciled balances between the General Ledger (GL) and Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) with discrepancy amounting to ₱844,481,727.61; b)  non-recognition of disposed PPEs totaling ₱5,777,975.25;   c) adjustments to Office Equipment and Information and Communication Technology Equipment amounting to ₱97,750.00 and ₱684,000.00, respectively, without proper supporting documents; d) non-recognition of depreciation of various PPEs; and e)  non-submission of Report on the Physical Count of PPE contrary to Section 38, Chapter 10 of GAM Volume I. (Observation No. 7)



We recommended that Management require the: a) Accounting Section to:             i) reconcile the GL and PPELCs balances and prepare necessary adjustments to arrive at accurate amounts; ii) prepare necessary accounting entries to recognize disposal of various PPEs with total net book value of ₱5,777,975.25; iii) submit necessary supporting documents to the Office of the Auditor to support the adjustments made, otherwise, cause the reversal of the same in the books of account; and iv) prepare accounting entries to recognize depreciation of nine PPEs for CY 2020 and that of the four PPEs pertaining to prior years; and b) Property Section to submit the RPCPPE for CY 2020; and thereafter on or before January 31.
