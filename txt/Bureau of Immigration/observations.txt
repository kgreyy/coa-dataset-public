PART II – AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)		FINANCIAL AUDIT



Unreliable Cash – Collecting Officers (CCOs) account



1)	The balance of Cash-Collecting Officers account amounting to ₱58,963,127.95 as at year-end was unreliable due to: a) presence of negative Subsidiary Ledger balances in the aggregate amount of  ₱14,114,436.65;    b) inclusion of the accounts of former Collecting Officers totaling ₱9,501,388.07; and c) unadjusted amount of ₱10,021.96 contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020, Volume III, Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) 2019 for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Section 69 of PD 1445 and Paragraph 32, Chapter 2 of the Revised Cash Examination Manual (RCEM).



	1)	Pursuant to COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 of Volume III, RCA (2019) for NGAs: Cash – Collecting Officer is debited to recognize the amount of collections with the Collecting Officers for remittance to the account of the Treasurer of the Philippines (TOP)/deposit to AGDBs. This includes unremitted collections of collecting officers who are no longer designated as such, whether in active service or separated from the service. This account is credited for remittance to the TOP/deposit to AGDBs, adjustment due to incurrence of cash shortage by the collecting officer, relief of accountability or restitution of misappropriated collections.



	2)	As of December 31, 2020, the reported balance of Cash-Collecting Officers account amounted to ₱58,963,127.95 broken down as follows:

The details are presented in Annex B.

	

	4)	Compared to prior year’s negative balances, this year’s negative balance has increased by ₱4,709,825.31 or 50.08 percent which resulted in the reduced ending balance of the Cash – Collecting Officers account by the same amount. This creates an impression that the Collecting Officers had deposited more than they have collected.  But in reality, these were caused by errors in recording collections and deposits. The existence of abnormal balances is indicative that the account is misstated and cannot be relied upon. 



b)		Inclusion of the accounts of former CCOs who were either   inactive resigned, retired, dismissed and deceased 

	

	5)	Review of the schedule/report of Cash – Collecting Officers account revealed the inclusion of accounts of former Collecting Officers totaling ₱9,501,388.07 comprising of the accounts of 109 COs who ceased to perform their duties and were transferred to another section/division but still connected with the BI amounting to ₱8,219,952.16, and 23 COs who were either resigned, retired, dismissed or deceased amounting to ₱1,281,435.91.  It is informed that some retired/resigned AOs did not secure clearance from Accounting Section. Thus, collectability of ₱1,281,435.91 is very uncertain (Details are shown in Annex C).



c)		Unadjusted amount of ₱10,021.96



	6)	The amount of ₱10,021.96 pertained to the transactions in CY 2018 that remained unadjusted in the books as to date due to lack of supporting documents. The Accounting Section reasoned out that until now, they still find it difficult to locate the corresponding JEVs relating to the aforementioned transactions.  Hence, the balance of Cash – Collecting Officers is still overstated by said amount.



	7)	Considering the length of time that has elapsed, collections should have been deposited to the AGDB but due to non-adherence to the provisions of COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 on adoption of Volume III – RCA (2019) for NGAs, Section 69 of PD 1445 and Paragraph 32, Chapter 2 of the RCEM and non-monitoring of collection by Management, the requirement to deposit collections was not done by some Collecting Officers.



	8)	We recommended that Management:



a)			require the Accounting Section to make a thorough analysis on the negative SL balances amounting to ₱14,114,436.65 and make necessary adjustments, if warranted, and require all Collecting Officers (COs) to regularly reconcile their records with that of the Accounting Section to come up with correct/accurate balance;



b)			intensify efforts to collect accountabilities of former COs in the total amount of ₱9,501,388.07 and/or initiate appropriate remedies to recover the same. Inasmuch as the accounts of inactive COs are no longer reflective of the account, reclassify the amount of ₱8,219,952.16 to Due from Officers and Employees account and those of the resigned/retired/dismissed/deceased COs in the amount of ₱1,281,435.91 to the account of Other Receivables; or request for write off of dormant receivables from COA, if warranted; and



c)			make a thorough analysis and validations of the amount “for adjustment” of ₱10,021.96 and make adjusting entries to correct the account balance.





Unreliable balance of Cash-in-Bank account



2)	The accuracy of the Cash in Bank account balance of ₱863,101,527.01 as at year-end  is unreliable due to discrepancies between the balances per books and per bank which could be attributed to: a) delayed preparation or non-submission of Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) contrary to Sections 5 and 7, Chapter 21, GAM Volume I; b) non-cancellation of stale checks aggregating ₱161,928.52 which is not in conformity with Section 44, Chapter 6 of GAM Volume I and Treasury Circular No. 03-2017 dated 20 October 2017; and c) non-recording of book reconciling items totaling ₱8,098,582.95 under LBP CA No. 0012-1046-18. 

			

	1)	Records disclosed that as of December 31, 2020, the Cash in Bank account has an aggregate balance of ₱863,101,527.01. However, said balance does not reconcile with the balances per bank statement of the five bank accounts maintained by the Agency.  Details are presented below:

		  *Bank Reconciliation Statement not yet submitted as of to date



	2)	The discrepancies could be attributed to the following:



a)		Delay in the preparation or non-submission of BRS



	3)	Section 5, Chapter 21ofthe GAM requires, the Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies of Debit Memoranda (DM)/ Credit Memoranda (CM) from the GSB, reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the BRS in four copies.



	4)	Section 7 further requires the Chief Accountant shall submit the BRS with all the supporting documents and JEVs within twenty days after receipt of the monthly BS to COA Auditor.



	5)	One control procedure to establish fair valuation of cash is the reconciliation of the balances between the agency’s books of accounts and the bank’s records. The objectives of preparation of BRS are to check correctness of both the bank and agency’s records and serve as a deterrent to fraud.  Hence, the preparation of a monthly BRS is an indispensable tool to check the existence and accuracy of the balances of cash per book and per bank. Failure or delayed submission of such documents will lead to failure in achieving these objectives.



	6)	In the audit of the Cash in Bank account, we noted that there were delays in the preparation and submission of the BRS.  Furthermore, the BRS for LBP Account Nos. 3401-0379-68 for the period September 2019 – December 2020 were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor.         The detailed Status of Preparation/Submission of BRS for CY 2020 is presented in Annex D.



	7)	Inquiry with the personnel in-charge in the preparation of BRS disclosed that the reasons for the delay or non-submission of BRS were due to:    (a) voluminous transactions, and (b) not updated information/records needed in preparation of BRS due to lockdown/frequent suspension of work/alternative work assignment of employees brought by COVID 19 pandemic.



	8)	Delayed or non-submission of BRS on time is contrary to Section 5 and 7 of Chapter 21, GAM, Volume I; thus, timely audit and verification thereof could not be made.



b)		Non-cancellation of stale checks with an aggregate amount of ₱161,928.52



	9)	Section 44, Chapter 6 of GAM, Vol. 1 provides that: Checks may be cancelled when they become stale, voided or spoiled.  The depository bank considers a check stale, if it has been outstanding for over six (6) months from the date of issue or as prescribed.



	10)	Also, voided, spoiled or unclaimed checks with the Cashier shall be marked cancelled on its face and reported as cancelled in the List of Unreleased Checks that will be attached to the RCI.



	11)	Moreover, Treasury Circular No. 03-2017 dated October 20, 2017 also requires, the reduction in the expiry period of MDS check from six (6) months to three (3) months from date of issue.



	12)	Review of BRS showed that various stale checks with aggregate amount of ₱161,928.52 were not yet cancelled and still included in the outstanding checks as of December 31, 2020.  Details are presented below:

	13)	The non-cancellation of stale checks is not in conformity with Section 44, Chapter 6 of GAM Volume I and TC No. 03-2017 dated October 20, 2017.



c)	Non-recording of reconciling items totaling to ₱8,098,582.95 under LBP CA No. 0012-1046-18

 

	14)	Section 6, Chapter 21, GAM Vol. I, Recognition of Adjustments.         The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall prepare a JEV to recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the books of accounts.



	15)	Based on the AAR for CY 2019, a total of ₱53,500,247.20 was noted as discrepancy between the book and bank balances under LBP CA No. 0012-1046-18.  Breakdown as follows:

	16)	Out of this discrepancy, ₱8,098,582.95 book reconciling items remained unrecorded in the books as per December 2020 BRS. The details are shown in Annex E.



	17)	Timely recording of book reconciling items precludes potential loss of government funds. Prompt recognition of these reconciling items enables the Accounting Section to determine the correct balance of the Cash in Bank; thus, preventing occurrence of shortage, loss, or misuse of public funds.



	18)	We recommended that Management require the:



a)	Accounting Section to submit the 16 BRS for Account No. 3401-0379-68 covering the period September 2019 to December 2020;



b)	Cashier to cancel checks totaling ₱161,928.52; and



c)	Accounting Section to record the ₱8,098,582.95 book reconciling items of LBP CA No. 0012-1046-18 and cancellation of checks.



	19)	The Management commented that:



a)	As of February 24, 2021, the BRS for LBP No. 2401-0379-68 for the months of September 2019 to December 2019 were already prepared and will be submitted to COA immediately.  The preparation of the remaining BRS will be expedited to be able to comply with the recommendation;



b)	The stale checks with an aggregate amount of ₱161,928.52 were already adjusted and effected in the books through various JEVs.  Thus, the said checks were not considered outstanding as of December 31, 2020.  The Accounting Section commits to regularly monitor the checks being issued and adjustments will be effected immediately; and



c)	Adjustments were already made through various JEVs.                 The remaining unadjusted balance amounted only to ₱2,617,336.76.  Continuous reconciliation is being done and any necessary adjustments will be effected in the books immediately.



	20)	Auditor’s Rejoinder



No proof of cancellation of the said checks was submitted to this Office. Only four out of 16 BRS were only submitted to the Audit Team. No adjustment was made to reconcile the book reconciling items. The Accounting Section simply presented the net effect of the reconciling items.





3)	Despite issuance of DOJ Department Order Circular No. 026 dated June 1, 2016 revoking the April 12, 1999 BI Memorandum Circular, administrative fines from 2017 to 2020 totaling ₱1,068,000.00 were not collected. 



	1)	Pursuant to COA Memorandum 2020-001, prescribing Volume III, Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) for NGAs, Accounts Receivable is used to recognize the amount due from customers arising from regular trade and business transactions. This account is credited upon collection, transfers, write-off, and/or adjustments of receivables.



	2)	The BI uses the Accounts Receivable account to record the uncollected/unpaid administrative fines from various airlines for bringing to the Philippines aliens/passengers who are not properly documented.  Accounts Receivable is recognized based on Exclusion Orders prepared and submitted by the Port Operation Division to the Accounting Section.



	3)	The Accounts Receivable account has balance of ₱273,286,099.00 as of December 31, 2020 consisting of Regular and Administrative Fines, as shown below:

Uncollected administrative fines amounting to ₱273,185,000.00



	4)	The imposition of administrative fines from various airlines was authorized by Section 44 (c) of the Philippine Immigration Law, which states that, If any vessel or aircraft arriving at a port in the Philippines from a place outside thereof brings on board any alien bound for the Philippines who is not properly documented as required by this Act, the pilot, master, agent, owner, or consignee of the vessel or aircraft shall be subject to a fine of five hundred pesos in the case of each person brought.



	5)	The fine of ₱500.00 was increased to ₱50,000.00 under Unnumbered Memo Circular dated April 12, 1999 issued by then Commissioner Rufus B. Rodriguez and approved by former Justice Secretary, Serafin L. Cuevas.  Increase of administrative fines was also included in the approved immigration fees and fines published in the Malaya Newspaper in CY 1999.



	6)	The legality of said memorandum was questioned by the airline companies resulting in the non-payment of imposed administrative fines to them. In view of this, the DOJ issued Department Order Circular No. 026 dated June 1, 2016 revoking the April 12, 1999 BI Memorandum there being no legal basis. Based on this DO Circular, the BI Commissioner issued Letter  Directive No. JHM-2016-036 dated July 19, 2016 to Acting Chief, Port Operation Divisions and Chief, Legal Division to stop from charging and imposing ₱50,000.00 fine against airline and shipping companies; instead, the vessel or aircraft shall be fined in accordance with the amount stated in Section 44(c) of the Philippine Immigration Law, as amended, which is ₱500.00 for each person brought on board, bound for the Philippines, who is not properly documented. 



	7)	The accumulation of the uncollected administrative fines for CYs 2016 and below was due to the refusal of airline companies to pay the ₱50,000.00 fines imposed prior to the issuance of DO Circular No. 026 in the aggregate amount of ₱272,117,000.00 due to the dispute on the legality of the Unnumbered Memorandum dated 12 April 1999 increasing the fees from ₱500.00 to ₱50,000.00 which until now remained not resolved despite BI seeking guidance from the Secretary of Justice (SOJ) through a letter dated July 9, 2019. 



	8)	Moreover, despite the issuance of Letter Directive No. JHM-2016-036 dated July 19, 2016, some airline companies refused to pay administrative fine of ₱500.00 per person; hence, the uncollected fines for CYs 2017 to 2020 have accumulated to ₱1,068,000.00. Details are as follows (Annex F):

	9)	At present, billing statements are being sent to the offices of the delinquent airline companies indicating the balance due them, yet no response has been received from most of these airline companies.



	10)	We recommended that Management require the Accounting Section to exert diligent efforts to collect the administrative fines from the airline companies and apply proper or legal remedies to settle their accountabilities, if warranted.





Inactive Receivable Accounts



4)	The balances of Other Receivables, Due from Officers and Employees, and Accounts Receivable accounts of ₱7,427,867.73, ₱1,108,794.11 and ₱101,099.00, respectively, have been outstanding for more than five years due to failure of Management to monitor the accounts and pursue its collection from concerned personnel and LGUs.  



	1)		COA Circular 2016-005 provides the following:



5.4 	Dormant Receivable Accounts – accounts which balances remained inactive or non-moving in the book of accounts for ten (10) years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.



	1)		The Head of the government entity shall file the request for authority to write-off dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers to the COA Audit Team Leader (ATL) and/or Supervising Auditor.  No filing fee is required.

	

	2)		Audit disclosed that as of December 31, 2020, the accounts Other Receivables and Due from Officers and Employees of ₱7,427,867.73 and ₱1,108,794.11, respectively remained outstanding since year 2015 up to CY 2020 while Accounts Receivable amounting to ₱101,099.00 has been dormant for more than 50 years per Notes to Financial Statements.

	

	3)		Other Receivables account consists of unsettled accounts of various officials/employees/AOs and two Local Government Units (LGUs) in prior years which have been outstanding as to date. Details are shown below:

	6)		According to the Accounting Section, they have no way to identify names of officials and employees who had unsettled accounts to BI for PLDT personal calls because of non-availability of documents or records.  They reasoned out that most of the staff were just recently assigned in the Accounting Section and despite of their efforts, they had difficulty in tracing/locating whereabouts of prior years’ records/documents. Also, the account includes undeposited collections of deceased persons; thus, its collectability is doubtful. Moreover, Accounts Receivable pertains to collectibles from commercial airlines and shipping companies for billing overtime claims.



	7)		Had there been regular monitoring of receivables, collection of the same from concerned AOs and LGUs could have been implemented and pursued.  

	

	8)		We recommended that Management:



a)	require the concerned officials/employees to settle their accountabilities, otherwise, deduct from their salaries their unsettled accounts until full recovery of the amount; 



b)	require the Accounting Section to exert extra efforts to locate documents pertaining to outstanding receivables; and 



c)	send demand letters to concerned LGUs for immediate settlement of their accounts.

	

	

Doubtful Balance of Due from NGAs account



5)	The balance of Due from National Government Agencies account of ₱14,422,637.07 as of December 31, 2020 is doubtful due to unreconciled discrepancy of ₱3,923,159.33 between the balance per books and that of the implementing agencies contrary to Section 7.1 and 7.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005, Section 3.1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012 – 001, Section 4.9 of COA Circular No. 94 – 013, GAM and PD 1445, thus, affecting the fair presentation of the account in the financial statements. 



a)	Unreconciled discrepancy of ₱3,923,159.33 between the book balances of the accounts of the IAs and the BI



	1)	As of December 31, 2020, the Due from National Government Agencies account has a balance of ₱14,422,637.07 pertaining to fund transfers to implementing agencies (IAs).  Confirmation letters were sent to IAs to verify balances recorded in the books of the BI.  Comparison of the book balance against the confirmation replies showed the following:

	2)	Out of four Confirmation Letters sent, only the PS-DBM and BIR replied. At present, we are still awaiting the replies from the Bureau of Customs and the Bureau of the Treasury.

	

	3)	The discrepancy of ₱3,698,159.33 between the books of BI and PS-DBM could be attributed to: (a) unrecorded deliveries; (b) error in recording deliveries; and (c) unaccounted amount due to absence of documents/records.



	4)	The failure of the Accounting Section to conduct periodic reconciliation with the PS-DBM resulted in the huge discrepancy of ₱3,698,159.33.



b)	Unrecorded deliveries



	5)	Purchase of office supplies made by the BI through PS-DBM requires an advance payment equivalent to the total amount indicated in the APR which the BI records as debit/addition to the account Due from NGAs-PS-DBM. Upon receipt of the items specified in the APR, the BI credits/reduces this account by the cost of such items.

	

	6)	The confirmation reply of PS-DBM revealed that there were unrecorded deliveries in the books of BI amounting to ₱2,320,515.68, to wit:

	7)	These unrecorded deliveries resulted in the overstatement of the account Due from NGAs (PS-DBM) in the amount of ₱2,320,515.68 and the understatement of Inventory account in the amount of₱350,820.00, ICT Equipment in the amount of ₱1,139,921.28, and Office Equipment in the amount of ₱829,774.40.

	

	8)	COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated Dec. 19, 2016 requires the Accountant to:



Section 7.1 – Conduct regular and periodic verification, analysis, and validation of the existence of the receivables, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers and determine the concerned debtors, accountable officers (Regular and Special Disbursing Officers, Collecting Officers, Cashier) and the source and implementing government entities concerned.

	

Section 7.2- Reconcile the unliquidated fund transfers between the source and implementing government entities, prepare the adjusting entries for the reconciling items noted, and require liquidation of the balances.

	9)	The erroneous recording of deliveries resulted in the overstatement of the account Due from NGAs – PS-DBM by ₱10,000.00 and the understatement of the Inventory account by the same amount.



	10)	Attention of the Accounting Section is invited on one of the basic standards/fundamentals of accounting principles under Section 2a, Chapter 2, of the GAM, Volume I, which states that:



Accrual basis means a basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid).  Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate.  The elements recognized under accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue, and expenses.

	

	11)	Also, Chapter 3 of the GAM Volume II provides that, the account Due from National Government Agencies is used to recognize advances for purchase of goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers to the NGAs for the implementation of projects and other receivables from NGAs.  Credit this account upon receipt of goods/services, and liquidation of fund transfers/receivable.

	

	12)	Moreover, it should be emphasized that it is the responsibility of the Property or Supply Custodian to forward Copy 3 of the IAR, photocopy of the PO and DR to the Accounting Section for recording of accepted goods and posting them in the SLC (Seq. No. 5, Section 15, GAM, Volume I).  Lack of proper coordination between these offices resulted in unrecorded transactions.



d)	Absence of documents/records to support the transactions/accounts



	13)	We also noted that the account of the IAs include balances totaling ₱1,674,698.59 without records or supporting documents.

	15)	The unaccounted balance without records or supporting documents is contrary to Section 4 (6) of PD 1445 which requires that, Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentations.



	16)	Inquiry with Accounting personnel disclosed that the former Chief Accountant and Accounting Staff in-charged in the processing/recording of fund transfers did not turn-over records/documents pertinent thereto.  Accordingly, efforts were exerted. Some documents/records were found and necessary adjustment were already made except for unaccounted balances which could not be traced. 

	17)	Moreover, Management failed to require the PS-DBM to return or refund the unspent/unutilized fund, which is contrary to Section 4.9 of COA Circular No. 94 - 013 dated December 13, 1994 dated December 13, 1994 which states that: The Implementing Agency shall return to the Source Agency any unused balance upon completion of the project.



	18)	Considering the length of time that elapsed since these advances were made, the requested items should have been delivered. The unspent/unutilized funds have accumulated to ₱10,417,422.80. Out of this amount, ₱238,210.67 pertains to fund transfer during the year while the amount of ₱10,179,212.13 pertains to prior years’ transactions. Management should have requested the PS-DBM to return/refund said amount for subsequent remittance to the BTr.



	19)	We recommended that Management:



a)		direct the Accounting Section to immediately reconcile their records with the PS-DBM;

	

b)		require the Supply/Property Office and the Accounting Section to coordinate and record transactions accurately;



c)		require the PS-DBM to return or refund the unspent/unutilized balance of ₱10,417,422.80 for subsequent remittance to the BTr in conformity with Section3.1.3 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and Section 4.9 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994; and 



d)		direct the Accounting Section and the Supply/Property Office to exert efforts to locate records and documents to support the unaccounted amounts pertaining to prior years’ transactions under the accounts of BOC, BIR, BTr and PS-DBM. 



	20)	The Management commented that:

	

a)		Based on the PMS records, one of the unrecorded deliveries pertained to multi-purpose copy paper under Order Confirmation OD962713003 in the amount of ₱350,820.00 not yet delivered by the PS-DBM.  The order date was March 4, 2020 and the delivery period is within five days. However, due to the implementation of ECQ in Metro Manila, the delivery was halted. Consequently, the payment of ₱350,820.00 was reverted back to the BI E-Wallet;

	

b)		The Acting Chief, PMS agreed that it is the responsibility of the Property or the Supply Custodian to forward a copy of the IAR, PO and DR to the Accounting Section for recording of accepted goods and posting in SLC.  He also stated that they are constantly coordinating with the Accounting Section to build proper communication and coordination between their offices and reconciliation of records;



c)		The accounting Section commented that the FMD sent a letter to PS-

	DBM requesting confirmation of the balance of ₱10,417,422.80; and



d)		With regard to the accounts of BOC, BTr, and BIR, the Accounting Section commented the amounts have been dormant for several years. Despite their best efforts in locating supporting documents for these transactions, the Accounting Section cannot trace them anymore; thus, adjustment could not be made due to lack of information and valid supporting documents.



Misstatement of Inventory accounts

 

6)	The year-end balance of Inventory account amounting to ₱22,965,943.96 was misstated due to: a) unreconciled difference of ₱209,017,071.32 between the General Ledger (GL) and Supplies Ledger Cards (SLC) balances;         b) unrecorded issuance of office supplies and accountable forms; c) outright recording of procured items amounting to ₱21,428,303.50 as expenses instead of inventory; and d) presence of negative amounts in SLCs totaling ₱1,457,006.71 contrary to Appendices 5 and 6 of the GAM Volume II, Section 2a, Chapter 2 of GAM Volume I and Section 9, Chapter 8 of GAM Volume I; thus, affecting the fair presentation of the account in the financial statements.   Moreover, other deficiencies noted include: (a) non-maintenance of complete Stock Cards (SC) and SLCs; (b) incomplete supporting documents for issuances and adjustments of inventory items; and (c) delayed/non-submission of Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI).



	1)	Records showed that the Inventory accounts of the BI had a total balance of ₱22,965,943.96 as of December 31, 2020, as follows:

a)	Unreconciled GL and SLC balances of inventory accounts amounting to ₱193,459,714.28



	2)	Appendix 5 of GAM Volume II – General Ledger (GL) summarizes all transactions recorded in the GJ and special journal (e.g. CRJ, CDJ, CkDJ, etc.) maintained in the Accounting Division/Unit.   Xxx...



Controlling accounts in the GL shall be supported by details in the SLs.



Appendix 6 of the same Manual – Subsidiary Ledger shows detail for each control account in the GL which is maintained per account and fund cluster by the Accounting Division/Unit.  Xxx



At the end of each month, after all transactions in the journals have been posted the debit and credit columns of each account shall be footed in pencil and the balance indicated in ink.  The totals of the SL balances shall be reconciled with the corresponding GL controlling account.” (Emphasis supplied)



	3)	Comparison of the GL and Supplies Ledger Card balances showed a difference of ₱209,017,071.32, as presented below:

	4)	The SLC is a form used in the Accounting Section for each type of supplies to record all receipts and issuances; hence, it serves as the SL to inventory accounts.   The balance of this record must reconcile with the GL balance, however, the table shows that the SLC balance is more than the GL balance by ₱209,017,071.32.



	5)	The unreconciled difference between the GL and SLC balances was previously observed under AOM No. 2020-007 dated March 4, 2020 for CY 2019 transactions.  As of December 31, 2020, the GL and SLC had a difference of ₱209,017,071.32, an amount greater than the previous unreconciled balance of ₱50,975,946.84.



b)	Unrecorded issuances of Office Supplies Inventory and AF Inventory 



	6)	Issuance of office supplies and accountable forms during the year totaling ₱4,636,015.02 was not recorded in the books.

	7)	The unrecorded issuances of said inventories overstate the accounts Office Supplies Inventory and Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory by ₱4,221,422.66 and ₱414,592.36, respectively, and understate the related expenses accounts by the same amounts.



	8)	In view of this, we invite the attention of the Accounting Section on one of the basic standards/fundamentals of accounting principles under Section 2a, Chapter 2 of GAM Volume I, which states that:



Accrual basis means a basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid).  Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate.  The elements recognized under accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue, and expenses.



	9)	Although the unrecorded issuances were adjusted by Management in January 2021 under JEV Nos. 21-01665 RA AJE and 21-01-66 RA AJE, however, error in adjustments was noted.

	14)	Recognition of procured items as outright expense circumvents the recording of inventory for stock in the appropriate inventory account and tends to overstate the expenses and understate the corresponding inventory   contrary to Chapter 8, Section 9 of GAM Vol. I.



Non-maintenance of SC and SLC and negative amounts in SLCs



	15)	Moreover, Management failed to maintain complete SC and SLC as required in Section 9, Chapter 10 of GAM, Volume I.



	16)	Verifications disclosed that, no SCs were maintained for Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory, Drugs and Medicines Inventory and Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Inventory.  Also, SCs for Office Supplies Inventory were incomplete and could not be relied upon.  



	17)	Moreover, various items appearing in the SLCs have negative amounts totaling ₱1,457,006.71 (Annex H for details). This indicates that transactions were not posted promptly from source documents or errors in the purchases and issuances of supplies were not recorded which the Accounting Section should verify and analyze in coordination with the Property Management Section (PMS).



	18)	Also, Management failed to submit complete supporting documents for issuances of inventory items and adjustments in the JEV, contrary to Section 16, Chapter 8, GAM Volume I and Chapter 3, Annex A of GAM Vol. III.



	19)	Various JEVs were drawn to account issuances of various items involving Office Supplies Inventory and Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory, to wit:

	20)	However, we noted that the above mentioned JEVs were supported only by the Summary of RSMI without the approved RSMI and RIS which are required under Section 16, Chapter 9 of GAM Volume I.

	

	21)	Accounting entries were made to take-up adjustments for the accounts of Office Supplies Inventory and Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory, as shown below:

	22)	The above adjustments were made without the necessary for documents. No other documents were attached to the JEV, except copy of GL for CY 2019, to justify the debit adjustments to the said accounts; and the adjustments were not fully disclosed if there were deliveries needed to be recorded or adjusted.

	

	23)	In compliance with Sec. 16, Chapter 8, GAM Volume I and Chapter 3, Annex A of GAM Volume III, RSMI, RIS and other pertinent documents are required to be attached to the corresponding journal entries to ascertain the correctness and accuracy of recording of issuances and adjustments. Without these, said issuances and adjustments cannot be relied upon.



Non or late submission of RPCI



	24)	Moreover, RPCI was not submitted or late submitted contrary to Section 17 (i), Chapter 9, GAM Volume 1 and Paragraphs A and E, Appendix 66 of GAM Volume II. 



	25)	Section 17(i), Chapter 8 of the GAM Volume I states: Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) (Appendix 66) – shall be used to report the physical count of supplies by type of inventory as at a given date. It shows the balance of inventory items per card and per count and shortage/overage, if any. These include the semi-expendable property wherein the issue is covered by ICS. (emphasis supplied)



	26)	Paragraph A, Appendix 66 of GAM Vol. II provides that, RPCI shall be prepared semi-annually by the Inventory Committee and by fund cluster. Furthermore, Paragraph E of the same appendix expresses that the report shall be submitted to the COA Auditor concerned not later than July 31 and January 31 of each year for the first and second semesters, respectively.



	27)	Verification of records disclosed that except for Office Supplies Inventory, there was no RPCI submitted as at year-end for the other inventory accounts, namely: Drugs and Medicines Inventory; Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Inventory; and Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory. The absence of RPCI indicates that there was no physical inventory conducted for the said inventory accounts; thus, existence of the reported balance of inventory accounts in the aggregate amount of ₱22,965,943.96 is doubtful. Also, due to absence of RPCI, alternative audit procedures could not be undertaken due to non-maintenance of updated SLCs by the AS.



	28)	We also noted that the RPCI for Office Supplies Inventory account includes items which are not classified as Office Supplies Inventory account, such as Arrival Card, Departure Card, scrubbing pad and detergent powder.  The Arrival Card, Departure Card and the like should be reported/included in a separate RPCI for Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory, while the scrubbing pad and detergent powder, should be reclassified under Other Supplies and Materials Inventory account, hence; separate RPCI should be provided for inventory account.



	29)	Moreover, delayed submission of the RPCI for Office Supplies Inventory was also observed.   For semestral ending June 30, 2020, the RPCI was only submitted to the Office of the Audit Team on February 2, 2021, while for semestral ending December 31, 2020, it was only submitted on February 9, 2021 contrary to the prescribed dates of not later than July 31, 2020 and January 31, 2021, respectively.



	30)	We recommended that Management:



a)		require the Accounting Section to:



--	update the SLCs of various inventory accounts and make necessary adjustments, if warranted, to reconcile with the balance with the GL;



--	record/recognize the transactions promptly on the date they occur and make proper AJE  for  error committed in adjusting the unrecorded issuances of office supplies and accountable forms in the total amount of ₱4,636,015.02;



--	refrain from recording purchases of supplies and material and other items as outright expenses. Regular purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account;



b)		require the Supply/Property Section to submit approved RSMI and RIS in the total amount of ₱25,395,557.78, and for future issuances of inventories, approved RSMI and RIS must be attached to the JEV. Disclosure/information must be stated for reference purposes;



c)		direct the AS to update the SLC for all inventory accounts and the Property Officer to maintain SC for all types of inventories and regularly reconcile their records; and



d)		direct the concerned officials/Inventory Committee to conduct a complete physical count of all inventories regularly and submit the report thereon to the Office of the Auditor not later than July 31 for the semestral report ending June 30 and January 31 of the ensuing year for the semestral report ending December 31.





Unreliable Balance of PPE accounts



7)	The accuracy of the PPE accounts balance of ₱1,327,193,490.56 as of December 31, 2020 cannot be relied upon due to: a) unreconciled balances between  the General Ledger  and PPE Ledger Card with discrepancy amounting to ₱844,481,727.61; b) non-recognition of disposed PPEs totaling ₱5,777,975.25;   c) adjustments to Office Equipment and ICT Equipment amounting to ₱97,750.00 and ₱684,000.00, respectively, without proper supporting documents; d) non-recognition of depreciation for various PPEs; and e)  non-submission of Report on the Physical Count of PPE contrary to Section 38, Chapter 10 of GAM Volume I. 



a)	Unreconciled balances of the GL and PPELC with discrepancy amounting to  ₱844,481,727.61



	1)	Comparison of the General Ledger balance of PPE against the balance per PPE Ledger Card showed a discrepancy of ₱844,481,727.61, details are as follows:

	2)	The difference between the GL and PPELC balances was communicated to Management through AOM No. 2020-009 dated 09 March 2020. It was noted that the difference has increased to ₱844,481,727.61 from previously reported amount of ₱22,583,381.62 in 2019 audit report. 



b)	Non-recognition of disposed PPEs with an aggregate net book value of ₱5,777,975.25



	3)	Section 39, Chapter 10, GAM Volume I provides that: The cost of the PPE together with the related accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss shall be removed from the accounts (2014 ed. Financial Accounting, Volume I, Valix). The carrying amount of an item of PPE shall be derecognized on disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected from its use or disposal. The following are the policies on the disposal of PPE:



	4)	Records show that various unserviceable properties reported in two Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Properties (IIRUPs) were disposed on Oct. 7, 2020. The net book value of the disposed properties was ₱5,777,975.25, computed as follows:



                                Total Cost                                                     ₱115,559,502.52

                                Less: Accumulated Depreciation                    109,781,527.27

                                Net Book Value                                            ₱   5,777,975.25



	5)	The member of Disposal Committee sent a letter dated October 21, 2020 to the Acting Chief, Accounting Section, together with the IIRUPs and other supporting documents to serve as basis for dropping the value of PPEs from the books of accounts.   However, upon verification of the general ledgers for PPE accounts, it was noted that the subject properties were not dropped from the books of BI. Non-recording of disposed PPEs overstated both the PPEs and the related Accumulated Depreciation. 



c)	Adjustments to Office Equipment and ICT Equipment amounting to ₱97,750.00 and ₱684,000.00, respectively, were without proper/necessary supporting



	6)	JEV No. 20-12-013A dated December 2020 was drawn to take up the adjustment of payables account to reconcile with the Registry of Accounts Payable and CDJ. The entry made credited the Office Equipment and ICT Equipment accounts in the amount of ₱97,750.00 and ₱684,000.00, respectively.  



	7)	While documents are attached to the adjustment made, further scrutiny of records showed that none of the documents justified the adjustment made to the involved PPEs. 



	8)	Proper supporting documents are required to be attached to the journal entries to ascertain the correctness and accuracy of recorded issuances and adjustments. Without these supporting documents, the balances of Office Equipment and ICT Equipment accounts cannot be relied upon. 



d)	Accounting Section failed to recognized depreciation of various PPEs contrary to Section 27, Chapter 10, GAM Volume I.



	9)	Section 27, Chapter 10, GAM Volume I provides, Depreciation. PPE gradually loses its ability to provide service over the course of time. Because of this, its cost needs to be distributed on a systematic basis over its useful life. The allocated cost is referred to as depreciation. The depreciation charge for each period shall be recognized as expense unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset.  Xxx



	10)	Verification of records show that during CY 2020, nine PPE accounts were not provided with Allowance for Depreciation, to wit:



--	Other Land Improvements

--	Other Structures

--	Other Leasehold Improvements

--	Communication Equipment

--	Military Equipment

--	Disaster Response Equipment

--	Watercraft

--	Library Books and

--	Other PPE



	11)	Furthermore, it was observed that four PPE accounts  have no Accumulated Depreciation which means that depreciation was not recognized since these properties were acquired, viz:



--	Other Land Improvements

--	Other Structures

--	Other Leasehold Improvements and

--	Other PPE



	12)	PPE declines in value over time. Depreciation recognized periodic allocation of cost for the wear and tear of PPE accounts.  It represents the value of the asset that has been used up.  Details are presented in Annex J.



	13)	Failure of Accounting Section to recognize depreciation overstates the book value of the PPE accounts and understates the corresponding depreciation expense accounts. 



e)	Property Section failed to submit RPCPPE contrary Section 38, Chapter 10, GAM Volume I and Annex 73(E), GAM Volume II.



	14)	Section 38, Chapter 10, GAM Vol. I states, Physical Count of PPE.  The entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 71) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording. (emphasis supplied)



	15)	Annex 73(E), GAM Vol. II provides, It shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned and Accounting Division/Unit not later than January 31 of each year.



	16)	As to date, the RPCPPE for CYs 2019 and 2020 were not submitted to the Office of the Audit Team which indicates that no physical count of PPE had been conducted, which is contrary to the aforementioned provisions of Section 38, Chapter 10, GAM Volume I and Annex 73 (E), GAM Vol.II.



	17)	RPCPPE is used to report on the physical count of PPE by type which are owned by the agency; hence, non-submission of RPCPPE casts doubt on the existence of PPEs. 



	18)	We recommended that Management require the:



a)		Accounting Section to: 



--	reconcile the GL and PPELCs balances and prepare necessary adjustments to arrive at accurate amounts;



--	prepare necessary accounting entries to recognize disposal of various PPEs with total net book value of ₱5,777,975.25; 



--	submit necessary supporting documents to the Office of the Auditor to support the adjustments made; otherwise, cause the reversal of the same in the books of account;



--	prepare accounting entries to recognize depreciation of nine PPEs for CY 2020 and that of the four PPEs pertaining to prior years; and



b)		Property Section to submit the RPCPPE for CY 2020; and thereafter on or before January 31.

           



      Unliquidated Cash Advances 



8)	Advances to Special Disbursing Officers totaling ₱33,062,445.00 remained unliquidated at the end of the year due to non-submission of liquidating documents contrary to the pertinent provisions of PD 1445, COA Circular No. 97-002, COA Circular No. 2016-005 and Joint Circular No 2015-01 dated January 8, 2015.



	1)	Section 89 of PD 1445 states that, a cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served and no additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.



	2)	Sections 5.8 and 5.9 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 require that:



Section 5.8 – All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year.    Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipts.



Section 5.9 – At the start of the ensuing year, a new cash advance may be granted, provided that a list of expenses against the previous cash advance is submitted, however, when no liquidations of the previous cash advance is received on or before January 20, the Accountant shall cause the withholding of the AO’s salary.



	3)	Moreover, Section 6.1 of COA Circular No. 2016 005 dated December 19, 2016 states that, All government entities should conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due and demandable and that cash advances and fund transfers are liquidated within the prescribed period depending upon their nature and purpose.



	4)	Similarly, Section 6.2.2.7 of Joint Circular No 2015-01 dated January 8, 2015 of COA, DBM, DILG, Governance Commission for GOCCs and DND requires that, All cash advances for Confidential Fund and /or Intelligence Fund shall be liquidated at year-end.



	5)	The balance of Advances to Special Disbursing Officers account amounted to ₱33,062,445 as of December 31, 2020, to wit:

	6)	Out of the ₱33,062,445.00 balance, ₱28,042,445.00 or 84.82 percent pertains to prior years’ unliquidated cash advances, of which ₱28,000,000.00 refers to cash advances for Confidential Funds granted to former BI Commissioners from CY 2011 to 2014.  The liquidation reports of these Confidential Funds were forwarded to COA-Intelligence and Confidential Fund Audit Unit (ICFAU). Management is awaiting the issuance of the Credit Advice from the ICFAU, as basis in recording liquidations.  



	7)	The remaining ₱42,445.00 pertains to the cash advance granted to   Ms. Cristina B. Quirante  in 2014 for the conduct of trainings/seminars to be attended by BI Accredited Agents. However, Management failed to require the SDO to settle her accounts as to date.



	8)	On the other hand, the unliquidated cash advances of ₱5,020,000.00 refers to the following:

	9)	Although, the liquidation report of Commissioner Morente was forwarded to COAICFAU on January 18, 2020, still this is contrary to the provision quoted in Section 6.2.2.7 of Joint Cir. No 2015-01 dated January 8, 2015 of COA, DBM, DILG, Governance Commission for GOCCs and DND, stating that all cash advances for confidential fund and or intelligence fund shall be liquidated at year-end. 

	

	10)	The Acting Chief, Accounting Section issued demand letter dated January 4, 2021 to Jhester Rhyan Golepang, requiring the liquidation of cash advance amounting to ₱20,000.00, but as of this date, no liquidation report has been submitted.



	11)	The Accounting Section overlooked close monitoring of liquidation of cash advances and failed to apply the remedies provided by law, by withholding the salaries and other emoluments due the SDOs pursuant to COA Circular No. 97-002.



	12)	Clearly, these practices are contrary to the above quoted provisions which tend to overstate the assets account and understate the expense accounts.



	13)	We recommended that Management:



	a)		apply the remedies provided by law by withholding the salaries and other emoluments due the SDOs pursuant to COA Circular No. 97-002; and

	

	b)		require the Accounting Service to closely monitor the liquidations of cash advances and strict adherence to the rules and regulations on the granting, utilization/liquidations of cash advances.





Unreliable Advances to Contractors account



9)	The validity and accuracy of the balance of Advances to Contractors account of ₱5,144,566.95 cannot be ascertained due to: (a) non-maintenance of subsidiary record; and (b) inclusion of accounts totaling ₱3,166,423.72 without complete supporting documents and negative balance of ₱943,413.02 contrary to the existing laws, rules and regulations. 



	1)		As of 31 December 2020, the balance of Advances to Contractors account amounted to₱5,144,566.95. Verification of records showed that the transactions involved under this account are as follows:

a)		Non-preparation of SL contrary to Section 111(1) and Section 114 (2) of PD No. 1445; and Appendices 5 and 6 of GAM Volume II



	2)		PD 1445 provides the following:

	Section 114 -(2) Subsidiary records shall be kept where necessary.



	3)		Notwithstanding the existence of GL for the said account, no SL was provided to support this balance. As mentioned, SL is used to show the details for each control account in the GL. Without this, the existence and accuracy of this account cannot be relied upon. 



b)		Adjustment totaling ₱3,166,423.72 without complete supporting documents and existence of negative balance contrary to Annex A, Volume III of GAM (Updated 2019), Paragraph 4.1, Annex E of the IRR of RA No. 9184, and Section 4 (6) of PD 1445



	4)		Annex A, Volume III of the GAM) (Updated 2019) provides that, Advances to Contractor is debited to recognize amount advanced to contractors and consultants as authorized by law. This account is credited for recoupment of advances, and/or adjustments.



	5)		Paragraph 4.1, Annex E of IRR of RA No. 9184 -The procuring entity shall, upon a written request of the contractor which shall be submitted as a contract document, make an advance payment to the contractor in an amount not exceeding fifteen per cent (15%) of the total contract price, to be made in lump sum or, at the most, two installments according to a schedule specified in the Instructions to Bidders and other relevant Tender Documents.

	8)		In the last year’s audit report, it was mentioned that advances to Security Link Network and RB Soriano both made in 2015 totaling ₱3,166,423.72 were marked as “for adjustment” and the existence of negative balance of advances to Liberty Builders. No sufficient explanation was offered regarding these matters. The presence of these balances cast doubts on the veracity and accuracy of Advances to Contractors account.



	9)		We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations that Management:



a)	require the Accounting Section (AS) to prepare the SLs for Advances to Contractors account;



b)	direct the General Services Section to locate the pertinent documents on the subject projects and provide the Legal Office and Accounting Section with copies thereof for reference purposes; and



c)	direct the AS to prepare necessary adjustments in the books for advances with “subject to adjustment” and negative balances. 





Unreliable Other Assets account



10)	The accuracy of Other Assets account balance of ₱3,393,592.99 as at year-end cannot be relied upon due to absence of subsidiary record containing the details of the transactions contrary to the existing regulations. 



	1)	PD No. 1445 provides the following:



Paragraph 1, Section 111 - The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.



Paragraph 2, Sec. 114 - Subsidiary records shall be kept where necessary.



	2)	Also, Chapter 3, Volume III of GAM, Volume III provides that, Other Asset account is debited to recognize assets not falling under any of the specific asset accounts. This account is credited for disposal, reclassification to specific asset accounts, and/or adjustments.

			

	3)	As of December 31, 2020, the Other Assets account has a balance of ₱3,393,592.99.



	4)	Scrutiny of records showed that the earliest retrieved record for Other Assets account was the GL for CY 2012 having a debit balance of ₱17,224,131.92. Two adjustments had been made since then; the latest of which was made in February 2015 for the disposal of unserviceable vehicles. Since then, no transaction has been recorded; thus, non-moving for six years.



	5)	Inquiry with the Accounting Section, the Other Assets account was supported only by the GL and no SL, neither the breakdown nor the details to support the account; thus, accuracy of the account balance is doubtful.  

	

	6)	We recommended that Management direct the Accounting Section to prepare subsidiary ledger for Other Assets account indicating the details/breakdown of the transactions.

	

		

			Misstatement of Accounts Payable account



11)	The balance of  Accounts Payable account amounting to ₱14,780,883.58 as of December 31, 2020 was misstated due to inclusion of: a) long-outstanding balance of ₱672,214.03 not reverted to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) of the General Fund (GF); and b) unadjusted erroneous entries aggregating ₱6,877,831.63, contrary to Chapter 3, GAM Volume III. Moreover, Accounts Payable amounting to ₱653,403.94 was not supported with documents contrary to Section 2 (a) Chapter 6 of GAM Volume 1 and Section 4 (6) of PD 1445.

	2)		Section 98 of PD 1445 specifies that, The Commission, upon notice to the head of agency concerned, may revert to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund of the national government, any unliquidated balance of accounts payable in the books of the national government, which has been outstanding for two years or more and against which no actual claim, administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by perfected contracts on record.

	3)		Similarly, Section 1 of EO No. 107 dated August 13, 2019 states that, All documented payable for fiscal year 2016 and years prior thereto shall be reverted to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund, or the Cumulative Result of Operations of the National Government. Henceforth, all documented accounts payable which remain outstanding for at least two years, for which no actual administrative or judicial claim has been filed, shall be subject to automatic reversion.



	4)		Verification of SL/schedule maintained by the Accounting Section revealed payables amounting to ₱672,214.03 which have been outstanding for more than two years were not adjusted or reverted to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) or to the Cumulative Result of Operations of the National Government, to wit:

	7)		Documents to support the above balances are not available upon verification; thus, undocumented accounts payable should be adjusted accordingly.

	

	8)		Section 2 (a), Chapter 6 of the GAM defines Accounts Payable as, valid and legal obligations of NGAs/OUs, for which goods, services, projects have been delivered/rendered/completed and accepted, regardless of the year which these obligations were incurred.



	9)		Also, Section 4 (6) of PD 1445 requires that, Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.



b)		Unadjusted erroneous entries aggregating to ₱6,877,831.63



	10)		Chapter 3 of GAM Volume III describes that Accounts Payable is used to recognize receipt of goods or services on account in the normal course of trade and business operation.  Debit this account for payment or settlement of liabilities.



	11)		Our validation disclosed that out of the total balance of Accounts Payable account  of  ₱14,780,883.58,  the  total   amount   of   ₱6,877,831.63  was 



	already paid on various dates but recorded in the books by debiting expense and crediting Cash accounts The Accounting Section failed to adjust the Accounts Payables; thus, overstating both the Accounts Payable account and the related expense accounts by the same amount (Details in Annex K).



	12)		We recommended that Management direct the Chief, Accounting Section to:



a)	revert to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) of the General Fund or the Cumulative Result of Operations of the National Government long-outstanding balances of accounts payable and adjust the erroneous entries aggregating  ₱6,877,831.63, and



b)	submit the required documents to support the claims otherwise, prepare necessary adjustment for undocumented accounts payable. 





       Misstated Food Supplies Expenses



12)	The balance of Food Supplies Expenses account of ₱7,993,520.00 as of December 31, 2020 was misstated due to: a) double recording and misclassification of food supplies expenses in the amount of ₱28,400.00; and b) inclusion of expenses amounting to ₱548,880.00 incurred in 2019 contrary to the existing rules and regulations resulting in the overstatement of Food Supplies Expenses and Accounts Payable by ₱577,280.00 and ₱28,400.00, respectively, and the understatement of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) by ₱548,880.00.



	1)	As defined in GAM, Vol. III, Food Supplies Expenses account is used to recognize the cost of food issued to hospital/rehabilitation patients, jail inmates and the like.  This account shall be closed to Revenue and Expense Summary account.



	2)	Section 2a, Chapter 2, GAM Vol. I states that, “Accrual basis means a basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid).  Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate.  The elements recognized under accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue, and expenses.”





	3)	The General Ledger balance of the Food Supplies Expenses account amounted to ₱7,993,520.00 as of December 31, 2020. However, audit of DVs pertaining to payments thereto disclosed that the catering services rendered to foreign nationals detained at BI -Holding Facility, Camp Bagong Diwa, Bicutan, Taguig City for CY 2020 amounted to ₱7,965,120.00 only or a discrepancy of ₱28,400.00, to wit:

	4)	The amount of ₱28,400.00 pertains to the reimbursement of transportation expenses of Eleanor Trinidad, SDO of Sub-port of BI, which was also included in the amount of ₱1,541,680.00 recorded under JEV No. 20-08-329 dated August 06, 2020; thus, recorded twice in the books. The double recording resulted in the overstatement of both Food Supplies Expenses and Accounts Payable by ₱28,400.00. Consequently,  overstating Food Supplies Expense and understating Travelling Expenses – Local both by ₱28,400.00 due to misclassification of accounts.

	6)	This is contrary to Section 119 of PD 1445 which states that, All lawful expenditures and obligations incurred during the year shall be taken up in the accounts of that year.



	7)	We invite the attention of the Accounting Section on one of the basic standards of accounting principles under Section 2a, Chapter 2, of GAM, Volume I:



Accrual basis means a basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid).  Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate.  The elements recognized under accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue, and expenses.



	8)	We recommended that Management:



a)	prepare the necessary adjustments to correct the overstatement of both the Food Supplies Expenses and Accounts Payable; and



b)	direct the Acting Chief, Accounting Section and the Acting Chief, Budget Section to record all lawful expenditures and obligations incurred under the accounts in the year to which they relate.

Management Comment

Collections not regularly deposited within the prescribed period contrary to Section 69 of P.D. 1445 and Paragraph 32, Chapter 2 of the RCEM.



Out of the year-end balance of ₱58,963,127.95, the amount of ₱47,833,404.33 pertains to prior years’ balance while ₱11,129,723.62 pertains to collections during CY 2020.  Inquiry with the Accounting Section personnel revealed that part of the 2020 unremitted collections amounting to ₱23,597,841.70 was deposited only in January 2021.



Moreover, during the cash examination, we noted the delays in deposits of collections of the following CCOs:

We recommended that Management:



a)	require the COs to deposit their collections intact and daily or not later than the next banking day pursuant to paragraph 32, Chapter 2 of the RCEM and Par. D of Appendix 26, GAM, Volume II to avoid possible loss, misuse, theft or misappropriation of funds; and



b)	advise the Acting Chief, Cash Section, to closely and regularly monitor collections and deposits of funds by COs, to deter acts of not depositing all collections intact, within the prescribed period and to avoid accumulation of funds under the custody of COs;



Cash examination revealed an overage in the accountabilities of the following COs:

Ramos, Roilo

46,484.85

Santos III, Demeria E.

Gobole, Angelo Paolo DC.

2,609.75



Mr. Ramos claimed that out of ₱46,484.85, the amount of ₱28,920.00 pertained to unfinished transaction which could not be validated due to absence of an Order of Payment Slip (OPS); and the ₱17,564.85 was allegedly a personal “change fund” which was co-mingled with his collections.



The Audit Team noted that the amount of ₱28,290.00 was not reflected in the systems generated RCD because there was no OR issued by the CO, contrary to Section 68 (1) of PD 1445.



The Audit Team issued demand letters to the concerned COs, and later on Auditor’s Rejoinders expressing that that the Audit Team stands firm with the observations that the overage was found during the examination of the cash and accounts of the COs and should be forfeited in favor of the government and urge the BI Management to direct COs to issue OR immediately therefore which is required in Paragraph E of Chapter IV of the RCEM.

We recommended that Management:



a)	require the concerned CO to submit to the Audit Team, the Order of Payment Slip for the amount of P28,920.00 for validation purposes;



b)	direct all COs to see to it that all cash collected/received are supported with OPS and immediately issue corresponding OR to acknowledge receipt of the money, in compliance with Section 40, Chapter 5 of GAM Volume and Section 68 (1) of PD 1445; and



c)	prohibit all COs from maintaining personal “change fund” and mingling it with their collections to avoid incurrence of overages. Reconcile daily Cash on Hand with the balance in the CRR as required in Appendix 29 of the GAM, Volume II to monitor their accountabilities.





Reconciliation of Cashbook and Subsidiary Ledger (SL) was not done periodically; thus, recording errors were not immediately detected and corrected, contrary to No. 7, Chapter 2 of COA Memorandum No. 2013-004.



Comparison of the recorded accountabilities in the Cash Receipts Record with the SL showed discrepancies due to unrecorded collections and deposits and erroneous   recording of transactions on both records, as shown below:

We reiterated our previous recommendations that Management:



a)	require the Heads of the Cash and Accounting Sections to perform periodic reconciliation of the CRR and SL of the CO in order to check the completeness and accuracy of both records; and



b)	require the Head of Accounting Section to make appropriate corrections on  noted discrepancies to prevent accumulation of errors that would be difficult to trace in the future; and record in the books all subsequent ACR I Card fees collected from immigrant applicants to comply with accounting standards for revenue and basic/fundamental principles on financial accounting.

The Accounting Section commented that they are continuously and regularly performing reconciliations of SL and CRR of all CO. Any discrepancy shall be adjusted and effected in the books immediately to prevent accumulation of errors that would be difficult to trace in the future.



The AS replied that they are  maintaining separate Cash Receipts Journal (CRJ) in recording collections from ACR I-Card transactions for non-immigrant and immigrant transactions. These are all recorded in the books in compliance with previous COA recommendation regarding this matter.



The monthly Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) was not submitted within the reglementary period, contrary to Section 7.2.1 COA Circular No. 2009-006.





We recommended that Management require the CO to submit the required RAAF to the Auditor within 10 days after the end of the month, in compliance with Section 7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006.







The Report of Collections and Deposits (RCD) submitted for express lane and miscellaneous fund were not certified by the CO, contrary to Appendix E on the “Instructions” in accomplishing the RCD.

We recommended that Management require the CO to follow instructions in accomplishing the RCD as provided in Paragraph E of Appendix 26, GAM, Volume II.



Only 89 percent of the total Express Lane (EL) fees collected were reflected in the CRR maintained by the CO for the express lane as the 11 percent was added to miscellaneous collections which were deposited to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr), contrary to the government accounting principle on fund cluster accounting. In effect, the transactions recorded in the SL for the said types of collections differ with the CRR.

We reiterated our previous recommendations that Management direct the Head of the Cash Section to record all collections and deposits pertaining to Express Lane to its CRR, in compliance with the basic accounting principle on fund cluster accounting provided under Section 6, Chapter 2 of GAM; and for the CO to prepare a separate remittance advice for the 11 percent EL collections instead of adding it to the remittance advice for miscellaneous collections.





The SDO failed to liquidate cash advances within the prescribed period, contrary to Section 89 of PD 1445, Section 1.2 of COA No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and Section 5.8 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997.  Moreover, liquidation report was not properly documented.

We recommended that Management direct the:



a)	concerned SDOs to immediately liquidate their CAs, pursuant to Section 89 of PD 1445;



b)	Acting Chief Accountant to closely monitor the CAs which have been idle for a period of at least two months, pursuant to paragraph 5.8 of COA Circular 97-002, in order for the Bureau to maximize the use of government funds; and 



c)	Acting Chief Accountant to see to it that liquidation reports are properly documented prior to recording in the books and submission to COA for post-audit in order to avoid audit suspension/disallowance

The Chief Accountant commented that they will strictly adhere with the recommendation in monitoring the unliquidated CAs and see to it that it is liquidated within the prescribed period.  Demand Letters were issued to AOs once their CAs were not liquidated within the said period.  Further coordination with COA will be done for the withholding of salaries of those who failed to liquidate within the said timeframe.

The CA with Check No. 92019038 dated April 26, 2019 was liquidated under LR No. 19-11-115 and recorded in February 2020.  Refund of P225,310.00 with OR No. 15679447 was also recorded.

The SDO does not maintain the prescribed Cash Disbursement Record (CDRec) to record the cash advances received and disbursed, contrary to Section 17, Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume I.

We recommended that Management:



a)	require the SDO to take heed of the aforementioned law, rules and regulations and maintain the prescribed CDRec in recording the transactions in compliance with aforementioned provisions of the GAM; and 



b)	instruct the Acting Chief Accountant (ACA) to orient or send to trainings or seminars newly designated SDOs on matters related to their work so they could properly and dutifully perform every assigned tasks.

The ACA commented that they will instruct the Accounting Personnel to orient all new SDOs before issuing CAs so as not to further commit violation of COA rules and regulations on CAs and see to it that the required documents (CDRec, Report of CD, etc.) are maintained before recording the liquidation.



The ACA commits to be stricter in implementing the guidelines of liquidation of CA and pray that there will be no audit suspension issued on this matter.

We recommended that Management direct the  assigned Immigration Assessor to prepare and review the Order Payment Slip (OPS) in order to ensure accurate assessment of immigration fees and avoid cancellation of official receipts pursuant to Section 2 of PD No. 1445, for proper disposition.











BI – Davao Office 

The Office of CO was not provided with proper safety lock/vault and alarm to safeguard  manifesting lack of internal control techniques contrary to Sections 123 & 124 of PD 1445 and Section 18, Chapter 6 of the GAM, thus exposing her collections to risk of possible loss thru robbery or theft.

We recommended that Management provide the Acting SCO, a safety vault with alarm for the effective safekeeping of her collections and accountable forms, thus avoiding the risk of possible loss of public funds/property thru theft and robbery.

14)	Improper imposition of liquidated damages to APO Production Unit, Inc. for delayed delivery of tabulating stock forms resulted in the overpayment of ₱75,321.99, contrary to the provisions of Annex “D” of the Republic Act (RA) No. 9184 and Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) signed by both parties.



	1)	Paragraph 3.1, Annex “D” of  RA No. 9184 requires that, When the supplier fails to satisfactorily deliver goods under the contract within the specified delivery schedule, inclusive of duly granted time extensions, if any, the supplier shall be liable for damages for the delay and shall pay the procuring entity liquidated damages, not by way of penalty, an amount equal to one-tenth (1/10) of one per cent (1%) of the cost of the delayed goods scheduled for delivery for every day of delay until such goods are finally delivered and accepted by the procuring  entity concerned.

	

	2)	Likewise, paragraph 8 of the MOA between BI and APO Production Unit, Inc., also requires that, In case of delays in the delivery of the goods of the Servicing Agency, a penalty of One Tenth (1/10) of One Per cent (1%) for every day of delay.



	3)	BI issued Purchase Order No. PS19-06-17 dated June 13, 2019 and Notice of Award to the Contractor/Supplier on June 25, 2019 for procurement of the Tabulating Stock Forms in the total amount of ₱8,602,000.00, to wit:

	4)	The MOA further elaborates terms and conditions relative to procurement of said items.  Par. 2 of the agreement provides that, The Servicing Agent shall deliver the items/goods in two schedules.  The first deliver shall consist of the half of the items/goods to be delivered within 30 calendar days from receipt of Notice of Award. The last delivery shall consist of the rest of the items/goods to be delivered three months after the First Delivery.

	

	5)	Delivery terms were not strictly followed by the Contractor.  Since the NOA was received on June 25, 2019, automatically, the first schedule of delivery for the 1st half of the items (4,150 Tabulating Stock Forms) should be July 25, 2020. However, only 2,650 forms were delivered on the agreed time schedule while 1,500 forms were delivered after the scheduled time.  Moreover, the 2nd batch of delivery should be Oct. 23, 2019, but it was made only on Dec. 6, 2019 or delayed by almost 45 days. Details are shown in Annex I.



	6)	The delays were communicated to Management through AOM No. 2020-007-101 dated March 4, 2020. The Accounting Section imposed liquidated damages amounting to ₱193,545.01 for delayed delivery of items procured which was deducted from the claim of APO Production Unit, Inc. under DV No. 01 (R)-2019-12-1518 dated December 18, 2019 and ADA No. 9920200004 dated January 14, 2020.



	7)	However, further audit/review of the DV and documents attached thereto disclosed that penalties/liquidated damages imposed were not proper and incorrect; thus, the overpayment of ₱75,321.99 to Contractor.

	8)	We recommended that Management:



a)	require the APO Production Unit, Inc. to pay ₱75,321.99 representing additional penalties/liquidated damages for delayed delivery of tabulating stock forms; otherwise, require the concerned officers of BI who processed/approved the claim of the Contractor to pay the same; and



b)	direct the Chief, Accounting Section to review properly supporting documents and compute correctly the amount due to the Contractor to avoid incurrence of the same in the future.





Audit of Food Supplies Expense account - ₱7,993,520.00

	

15)	Validity of payments for catering services totaling ₱7,993,520.00 rendered to foreign nationals detained at BI - Holding Facility, Camp Bagong Diwa, Bicutan, Taguig City cannot be ascertained due to: a) absence of valid contracts between the caterer and the Bureau and other supporting documents; b) non-provision of budget for subsistence allowance of each detainee in the GAA contrary to the existing laws, rules and regulations; and c) non-inclusion of such procurement in the Annual Procurement Plan.

 

	a)	Absence of valid contracts between the caterer and the Bureau and other supporting documents



	1)	The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was entered by and between the BI and the Caterer on February 3, 2010, thus, the MOA was valid only for CY 2010 expenditures, if ever, and cannot be used as basis for payment of expenditures for the succeeding years (2011 to present). GAA is being enacted on a yearly basis, in effect, all contracts should be made on a yearly basis also unless there was a multi-year obligational authority (MYOA) issued by DBM on the matter. Besides, BI cannot enter into contract because of the absence of fund or appropriation to cover the same.



	b)	The grant of subsistence allowance per detainee in the amount of ₱60.00/day was not programmed/provided in the GAA, contrary to Sec. 29 (1), Art. VI of the 1987 Constitution and Sec. 85 of PD 1445



	2)	One of the vital services rendered by the Bureau is the custody of foreign nationals with immigration offenses.  Each detainee was granted subsistence allowance in the amount of ₱60.00 per day for their food.  The food of the detainees was provided by a caterer by virtue of the MOA entered into by and between the BI and the caterer on February 3, 2010; thus, valid only for CY 2010 expenditures.  



	3)	The payments of catering services were claimed by the caterer and the corresponding costs were recorded in the books through a JEV by debiting Food Supplies Expenses and crediting Accounts Payable based on the list/number of aliens detained at the detention center twice a month.



	4)	Verification of transactions disclosed that the grant of subsistence allowance per detainee in the amount of ₱60.00/day was not provided in the GAA; hence, no funds had been appropriated for the said allowance.



	5)	GAA is being enacted on yearly basis, in effect, all contracts should be made on a yearly basis also unless there was a multi-year obligational authority (MYOA) issued by the DBM on the matter. Besides, BI cannot enter into contract because of the absence of appropriations to cover the same.



	6)	Management continued to pay said expenses from the regular release intended for MOOE. Payments made by BI to the caterer for the food supplied to the detainees were contrary to Section 29 (1) Article VI of the 1987 Constitution:



No money shall be paid out of the Treasury, except in pursuance of an appropriation law.



	7)	Also, Section 85 of PD No. 1445 requires that, no contract involving the expenditure of public funds shall be entered into unless there is an appropriation therefor; xxx.



	c)	Procurement of catering services for detainees was not included in the APP of the BI, contrary to Section 18 of RA 11465 (GAA for FY 2020) and Section 7, Rule II of RA 9184.



	8)	Section 18 of RA 11465 requires that, all agencies of the government shall strictly adhere to the provision of RA No. 9184, its IRR and GPPB guidelines in the procurement of goods, infrastructure projects and consulting services.



	9)	Furthermore, Section 7, Rule II of RA 9184 provides that:



Section 7.1 – All procurement should be within the approved budget of the Procuring Entity and should be meticulously and judiciously planned by the Procuring Entity.  Xxx.



Section 7.2 – No procurement shall be undertaken unless it is in accordance with the approved APP, including approved changes thereto. The APP must be consistent with the duly approved yearly budget of the Procuring Entity and shall bear the approval of the HOPE or second-ranking official designated by the HOPE to act on his behalf.



	10)	Audit of transactions disclosed that the procurement of food catering services was not among the activities included in the APP, even in the previous years, and no public bidding was conducted. Management completely disregarded the provisions cited in Section 18 of RA 11465 and Section 7, Article II of RA 9184 by honoring the MOA between BI and the Caterer which was entered on February 3, 2010 or 10 years ago.



	d)	No sufficient and relevant documents submitted to establish validity of claims contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and Section 4(6) of PD 1445



	11)	Audit of DVs covering the payments of catering services disclosed that said disbursements were insufficiently/inadequately documented. The claims for these expenses were only supported with the list of aliens detained at the facility with the amount of subsistence allowances allotted to each detainee for particular periods, certified by the Officer-in-Charge of BI.  However, other documentary requirements needed to support its validity were not attached to the DV. Among of these are:



--	Documents necessary to check the accuracy of the number of detainees in the list submitted by the Caterer:



--	Summary of Committed and Released Inmates on a daily basis duly signed by the Jail Warden/Superintendent;



--	Certificate of discharge on a daily basis, if there is any, duly signed by the Jail Warden/Duty Gater/Superintendent and other responsible officials.



--	Documents to prove the legitimacy of the Caterer’s entity/catering services/ business:



--	DTI Registration/Business Permit

--	Mayor’s Permit

--	City/Municipal Sanitation Permit

--	Other documents to prove legality of the supplier’s catering services/business.



--	Documents necessary to determine whether the expenses are reasonable, advantageous to the government, and the procurement of the catering service, in accordance with existing procurement procedures, laws, rules and regulations:



--	Such other documentary requirements under procurement depending on the mode of procurement adopted.



	12)	Processing/approving of claims without proper documentations is contrary to COA Cir. No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 and Section 4(6) of PD 1445.



	13)	COA Cir. No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 applies to all type of disbursements and requires: sufficient and relevant documents to establish validity of claims, while Sec. 4 (6), PD 1445 requires that, claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentations.



	14)	The foregoing deficiencies were also observed in previous year’s audit where Management failed to take action to correct said deficiencies during the year. 



	15)	We recommended that Management direct the Acting Chief, Accounting Section and approving officers to:



a)	submit legal basis to prove validity of disbursements for food expenses; and



b)	submit documentary requirements to prove validity of disbursements for food expenses.



	16)	The AS commented that they effected the necessary adjustment through JEV No. 21-01-634 dated January 2021 amounting to ₱28,400.00 to correct overstatement of the said account. They also replied that the grant of subsistence and medicine allowance of inmates in the sum of ₱60.00/per day was congruous and arranged based on the Special Provision(s) granted to BJMP and BUCOR for FY 2018, affirming the amount appropriated per prisoner as subsistence allowance per day is ₱60.00. Moreover, they wrote a letter to the BI-Warden’s Facility asking for assistance in securing the Caterer’s DTI Registration/Business Permit, Mayor’s Permit, City/Municipal Sanitation Permit and other relevant documents. The AS will forward said documents once submitted. The ACA and AC, BS also commented that expenditures incurred in previous year particularly the FSE served to the detainees for the period December 1-31, 2019 cannot be recorded and obligated in the books on the same period given the fact that the number of detainees varies day-to-day depending on the arrest, release and deportation made throughout the given period. 

	



16)	Non-compliance by the Bureau to the provisions of the Revised IRR of RA 9184 was noted such as: 



a)	Period of action on the procurement activities was not complied with by the agency in violation of Section 38.1 of RA 9184.



	1)	One of the basic principles in government procurement as provided in the IRR of RA 9184 is a streamlined procurement process that is compliant to laws, rules, regulations and policies. 



	2)	Section 38.1 of the IRR of RA 9184 prescribed that, the procurement process from the opening of bids up to the award of contract shall not exceed three (3) months, or a shorter period to be determined by the procuring entity concerned.



	3)	Annex C of the said IRR further prescribed for the period of action on the procurement activities providing for the latest allowable time as well as the maximum allowable period of action for each procurement activity.



	4)	The period of action on procurement activities is provided by law so that supplies, materials and equipment necessary and essential in the operations of government agencies are readily available.  These periods are set forth to address the incessant delay in the procurement activities that is affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of government operations.



	5)	Audit/evaluation of the submitted contracts/purchase orders for procurement of goods/equipment revealed that the period of action on the procurement activities exceeded the maximum allowable time as prescribed in the aforementioned rules/regulations/laws. The details are presented in the Annexes L and M.



	6)	The delay mostly occurred from the approval of resolutions up to the signing/approval of contracts. 



	7)	The prolonged lengthy process/activity is not compliant to the laws, rules, regulations and policies of the government, as well as, implies inefficiency in the implementation and completion of the entire procurement process that may affect the government operations and may result to the wastage of government funds.  



b)	Preparation and submission of the required Procurement Monitoring Report (PMR) to the Government Procurement and Policy Board (GPPB) was not complied with by the agency in violation of Section 12.2 of RA 9184.



	8)	Section 12.2 of RA 9184 states that, The PMR shall be approved and submitted by the HOPE to the GPPB in printed and electronic format within fourteen (14) calendar days after the end of each semester.  The PMR shall likewise be posted in accordance with E.O. 662, s. 2007, as amended.



	9)	It was noted that the PMR was not regularly prepared by Management and there is no proof that this was submitted to the GPBB, as required by the rule. The PMR was only prepared upon the request by our Office for audit purposes.  Moreover, the information indicated in the PMR was incomplete, which indicates only projects under/through public bidding and does not cover all procurement activities specified in the APP, such as contracts/POs under alternative modes of procurement.  Also, it does not specify in the report the standard and actual time for each major procurement activity, as required by the law.



	10)	Failure to prepare the PMR, procurement process/activity was not efficiently monitored by concerned personnel or sometimes some important procurement of goods/services necessary were not given priority, thus, procurement operations of Management as a whole, was affected.  



c)	Non-posting of Invitation to Bid (ITB), Notice to Proceed (NTP) and approved contract on the BI’s website and on its conspicuous places



	11)	Sec. 21.2.1 of RA 9184 requires that: Except as otherwise provided in Section 54.2 of this IRR and for the procurement of common-use goods and supplies, the ITB/Request for Expression of Interest shall be:



a)	Posted at a conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the premises of the Procuring Entity concerned for seven (7) calendar days as certified by the head of the BAC Secretariat of the Procuring Entity concerned.



b)	Posted continuously in the PhilGEPS website, the website of the Procuring Entity concerned if available, and the website prescribed by the foreign government/foreign or international financing institution, if applicable, for seven (7) calendar days starting on date of advertisement.



	12)	Also, Sec. 37.4.2 thereof states that: The Procuring Entity, through the BAC Secretariat, shall post a copy of the Notice to Proceed and the approved contract in the PhilGEPS and the website of the Procuring Entity, if any within fifteen (15) calendar days from the issuance of the Notice to Proceed.



	13)	The BI failed to post ITBs, NTPs and approved contract to its official website for projects/procurements under bid contracts and other alternative modes of procurement.  



	14)	These observations were discussed in the AOM previously issued to Management and they immediately acted on the audit recommendations, but for a short time being only.  The compliance on the aforementioned regulation was not strictly followed/adhered to by BI Management.   This   may result to impeding wider competition among bidders since other contractors/suppliers were not notified/invited to bid or participate in the procurement activity held/conducted by BI; thus, depriving the Agency of the most advantageous price in view of lesser competing bidders.



d)	No Notice to Proceed was issued to the Supplier for the procurement of small value of items through Purchase Orders contrary to Section 37.4.1



	15)	Upon issuance of NOA and signing/approval of POs, the BI failed to issue NTP, contrary to Section 37.4.1, which requires:



The concerned Procuring Entity shall issue the Notice to Proceed together with a copy or copies of the approved contract to the successful bidder within seven (7) calendar days from the date of approval of the contract by the appropriate government approving authority.  All notices called for by the terms of the contract shall be effective only at the time of receipt thereof by the successful bidder.



	16)	We recommended that Management:



a)	direct the concerned officials responsible in the different stages of the procurement process to submit explanations/justification for the lengthy and prolonged procurement process;



b)	require the responsible officer to prepare the PMR and submit the approved copy to the GPPB in printed and electronic format within 14 calendar days after end of each semester; and post the same in accordance with E.O. 662, s, 2007, as amended;



c)	direct the concerned officials to post the ITB, NTP and approved contract on the BI’s website and its conspicuous places; and



d)	direct all officials concerned to strictly adhere to the provisions of IRR of R.A 9184. 





17)	Non-submission of Notice of Delivery, Contracts, POs and supporting documents 



a)	Advance copy of government contracts, POs and their supporting documents were not submitted to the Auditor contrary to COA Circular No. 2009 - 01 dated February 12, 2020.



	1)	We observed that the submission of copies of perfected contracts and supporting documents to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed period had not been complied with by BI Management.  Out of 27 perfected contracts, only five were submitted but not within the prescribed period and the remaining 22 perfected contracts are still not submitted for review purposes. On the other hand two POs - PS20-01-01 and PS 20-05-09 were not yet forwarded to the Office of the BI Audit Team as of this date.



	2)	Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009 – 1 dated February 12, 2009 provides that:



Section 3.1.1 – Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.  In case of agencies audited on an engagement basis, submission of a copy of the contract and its supporting documents shall be to the Auditor of the mother agency or parent company, as the case may be.



Section 3.1.2 of the same Circular enumerates the documents required to be submitted.    



	3)	Non-compliance to the above-mentioned circular hinders timely review of the procurement contract, which is necessary in determining if the adopted procedures taken for the process are proper, regular, and in accordance with laws, rules and regulations.



b)	Notice of Delivery was not submitted to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed period contrary to COA Circular No. 96-010 dated August 15, 1996



	4)	COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 states that the agency official responsible for accepting deliveries of procured items shall, within twenty-four (24) hours from such acceptance, notify the Auditor of the time and date of the scheduled deliveries.  In case of partial delivery of any item in the P.O., the copy to be submitted shall indicate which items have been delivered, and which have not.



	5)	Our records revealed that some Notice of Delivery were submitted to the Office of the Auditor not within the prescribed period of 24 hours from the acceptance of goods/items.  Usually, Management submitted these Notices after three or more from the date of the deliveries of goods/items.  Further, it was noted that the submitted Notices were supported only by photocopy of Delivery Receipt and Inspection and Acceptance Report; thus, there is no proof that delivered items were properly accepted and inspected by Management, contrary to the provision of the aforementioned Circular.



c)	Other observations noted on procurement of small value items through POs



	6)	We also noted that POs prescribed in Appendix 61 of GAM Volume were not properly filled-out.

	7)	Non-compliance to the abovementioned provisions manifests a patent disregard to the promulgated rules and regulations of this Commission.



	8)	We recommended that Management require the concerned officials to:



a)	explain why noted deficiencies were not complied and performed efficiently;



b)	submit advance copy of government contracts and POs together with supporting documents to the Auditor within five working days from execution or from the date of perfection of contract/PO;



c)	submit advance copy of Notice of Delivery with supporting documents such as duplicate copy of DR and the IAR within 24 hours from the acceptance of the delivered goods/items;  and 



d)	strictly adhere to the governing rules and regulations.



	9)	The Property Management Section commented that some of the Notices were not forwarded to the Audit Team within the prescribed 24-hour period from the acceptance of goods/items due to the following reasons:



--	The PMS is operating on a Skeletal Workforce scheme; hence, the signatories are not present on a daily basis;



--	Likewise, only the inspecting and receiving officers are usually present; thus, the IAR was not submitted.



	10)	Management expressed that they will be working on measures to hasten and    comply with the 24-hour period.





Non-submission of financial reports



18)	Financial Reports and other financial documents were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor within the prescribed period contrary to COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995, Sections 5, 7 and 60 of Chapter 21, GAM, Volume 1 and Section 122 of PD 1445; thus, timely audit/verification of accounts/transactions could not be made.



	1)	Sections 6.04 and 6.05 of COA Circular 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 provide the time frame in the submission of various financial reports, and we quote:



Section 6.04 -Disbursing Officers in particular shall faithfully comply with Section 100 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 which requires them to render monthly reports of their transactions pursuant to existing auditing regulations not later than the fifth day of the ensuing month to the auditor concerned.

Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have complied with the requirements of the Commission.



Xxx...



	4)	The financial reports serve as a vital tool for management and the auditor in rendering and arriving at important decisions and audit actions.  In order for the users to utilize reports effectively, the same must be promptly submitted on time observing the prescribed timeline stated in the existing laws, rules and regulations.

	6)	Moreover, analysis also showed considerable delays in the submission of reports/documents during the whole year of CY 2020 ranging from eight days to more than three months, as shown in Annex O.



	7)	Inquiry with the Accounting personnel disclosed that the reasons for the delay or non-submission of financial reports/documents were due to the following:



--	voluminous transactions;



--	lockdown/frequent suspension of offices/AWA of employees because of COVID 19 pandemic;



--	RCD were not forwarded by Satellite Offices of BI to the Main Office/Accounting Section on time for recording in the books of accounts, and subsequent submission to the Office of the Auditor; and  



--	delayed in the pick-up of checks by payees.



	8)	The Acting Chief, Accounting Section promised to exert efforts to locate DVs/JEVs not yet submitted and submit all financial report  and supporting documents already due for submission.



	9)	Non-submission of financial report/documents within the prescribed timeline is inconsistent to the aforesaid laws, rules and regulations, thus, timely audit and verification could not be made. As such, transactions were not properly accounted for. 



	10)	We recommended that Management:



a)	require all the Satellite Offices to submit without further delay the RCDs to the Accounting Section;



b)	direct the Acting Chief, Accounting Section to submit to the Office of the Auditor without delay all the financial reports and supporting documents already due for submission as to date and observe strictly the reports deadlines; and



c)	address effectively the causes delaying the submission of financial reports and supporting records/documents.



	11)	Management commented that as to date, the financial statements for CY 2020, together with the detailed schedules, monthly TB from January to December 2020 and other supporting documents have been submitted to COA on February 11, 2021.  DVs, Payrolls, various JEVs, Liquidation Reports and BRS except for Account No. 3401-0379-68, were also updated as of December 2020 and were received by COA on various dates. The DVs enumerated in the AOM were also submitted by Accounting Section to COA.



The Bureau’s collections consist of Main and 59 Satellite Offices and sub-port offices nationwide. Hence, due to the voluminous transactions and the on-going pandemic situation that required AWA, the finalization and submission of the monthly statements cannot meet the prescribed period of submission considering that the Accounting Section is being prudent in recording these transactions to avoid, if not minimize, the errors being entered into the books.



Management assured that best effort is being exerted to avoid any violation of COA guidelines that will affect fair presentation of the financial statements. 





Gender and Development Program



19)	The submitted Gender and Development Plan and Budget was not approved by the Philippine Commission on Women and no Accomplishment Report had been prepared by the Management for utilization of GAD funds contrary to Section 31 of 2020 GAA, COA Cir. No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014, and PCW Memo Cir. (MC) Nos. 2020-01 and 2020-003 dated January 30, 2020 and April 27, 2020, respectively.



	1)	Section 31 of the GAA for fiscal year 2020 states that, All agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues on within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under R.A.

Conduct information caravan against human trafficking in Northern and Central Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.



Advertise thru airing information caravan on Anti Trafficking in Person (ATIP) Plus and with local media, LGU and NGOs concerns in Northern and Southern Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.

Conduct Gender Sensitivity Training of employees in BI offices located in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao to at least 75 percent of the BI manpower requiring the attendance of the members of the BIGADFPS Training Committee in CSC – as the facilitator of the training.



Conduct activities proposed by the PCW relative to the celebration of WOMEN’s MONTH

Develop and implement Gender Sensitive Human Resource Management Plan with effective career-pathing mechanism and temporary special measures to accelerate a de facto equality of men and women officials in the BI.

d)	Absence of gender sensitive/equitable policies, rules and regulations in support to the Gender - Balance in leadership and decision making positions in the Bureau.

Continue issuance and publication of Newsletter which would serve as a tool in monitoring the development of the GAD Caravan and other activities and accomplishments.

g)	No updated trainings, seminars and master’s degree of BI GAD members.

Enroll BI GAD members in local and international trainings, seminars and master’s degree.

h)	Poor detention facility which is detrimental to the health and welfare of detainees.

Propose budget for the rehabilitation of BI Detention.





	9)	The GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) was approved by the BI Commissioner and e-mailed by Management to the PCW on March 9, 2020, but no proof that the GPB was approved by the PCW.  The GPB was submitted to the Audit Team on December 21, 2020. 

		

	10)	Moreover, no Accomplishment Report was prepared by the Bureau for the proposed activities because these were not implemented during the year. The Bureau of Immigration Gender and Development Focal Point System (BIGADFPS) cancelled all the 2020 activities due to COVID-19 pandemic.  Accordingly, it is primordial to consider the welfare of all BI employees by prioritizing projects that is contributable to the purchase of items necessary to prevent transfer of the virus.

		

	11)	The above observations were contrary to COA Circular No. 2014 – 001 dated March 18, 2014, Section 31 of GAA of FY 2020, and PCW MCs No. 2020-01 and 2020-03.



	12)	We recommended that Management:



a)	allocate at least five percent of BI’s total budget for GAD activities to address gender issues;



b)	submit the Annual GPB to the Office of the Auditor within five working days from receipt of approved plan from the PCW; and



c)	adhere strictly to the provisions of GAA for FY 2020 for GAD matters, COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014, and PCW MCs No. 2020-01 and 2020-003.



	13)	Management commented that on March 9, 2020, the BIGADFPS submitted the GAD 2020 Plans and Programs to PCW with 2.23 percent of the BI approved GAA Budget for 2020. However, no endorsement was received from the PCW due to error in the BI-GAD GMMS account. Also, the subject PCW MC No. 2020-003 dated April 20, 2020 could not be applied since it was not communicated to the BI. Further, the 2020 Plans and Programs was submitted prior the COVID-19 pandemic and the activities stated thereon were no longer applicable due to the restrictions brought about by the pandemic. Hence, the failure of BIGADFPS to implement the GAD Plans and Programs. However, they committed to submit BI-GAD 2021 Plans and Budget with at least five percent of the BI’s approved GAA Budget for 2021 that will be beneficial to the prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic for BI employees and clients. Accordingly, they will comply with the recommendations of COA.

	4)	Since BI is one of the frontline agencies of the government and supports the government’s thrusts and programs on international related economic development, Management should look after the welfare of the country’s citizens, including senior citizens and differently-abled persons, who have transactions with the BI. Management should lead in proposing designs for structures and facilities that will enhance mobility, safety and welfare of senior citizens and persons with disabilities. 



	5)	Our inquiry revealed that for CY 2020, BI did not allocate a budget for the formulation of plans, programs and projects that will address the concerns of SCs and PWDs despite funds allotted in the GAA. 



	6)	We recommended that Management consider prioritizing the concerns of senior citizens and differently-abled persons in their plan and budget as required in Section 32 of the GAA, CY 2020.
