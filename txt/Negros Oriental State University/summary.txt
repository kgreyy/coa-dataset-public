SCOPE OF AUDIT 



Our audit covered the accounts of NORSU Main Campus and its five external campuses. The audit was conducted to:  (a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertion on the financial statements; (b) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (c) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.



AUDITOR’S OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 



	The auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the financial statements of the University due to the exceptions stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report and discussed in Part II of this Annual Audit Report.













SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 



	The following are the significant findings and the corresponding recommendations which, together with other observations and recommendations, are discussed in detail in Part II of this Report:



1)	Payroll cash advances of the University Cashier granted in the prior and current year amounting to ₱26,275,323,76 and ₱18,690,301.57, respectively, remained unliquidated at year-end contrary to Item 5 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 and Sections 14c and 15, Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, thus affecting the fairness of presentation of the financial statements and increasing the risk of misappropriation or loss of government funds in his possession. 



We recommended, and Management, thru the University President agreed to instruct the University Cashier to settle immediately all cash advances for payroll within five (5) days after the fifteenth day/end of the month pay period or when it has not been used for a period of two (2) months or at the end of each year. 



We also recommended that the University Accountant strictly monitor the submission by the University Cashier of his report of disbursements within the prescribed period and to recommend for the imposition of the withholding of his salary and other sanctions for failure to liquidate his cash advances on time.



Finally, we recommended that the University President instruct the University Cashier to use the vault instead of the steel filing cabinet to safeguard properly the funds for which he is primarily accountable.  



2)	The amount of ₱13,226,094.35 representing transfers to the Main Campus of unexpected balances of funds appropriated for the purchase of equipment, athletic activities and other purposes of the Bayawan-Sta. Catalina and Siaton external campuses were erroneously recorded as an asset account contrary to Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies, Volume I and the 2019 updated Revised Chart of Accounts, thus affecting the fairness of presentation of the financial statements at year-end.



We recommended and Management, thru the Campus Administrators, agreed to instruct the Campus Accountants and coordinate with the University Accountant to verify the fund transfer of unexpended balances to the Main campus in the prior years and prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the erroneous entry recording an invalid receivable account.





3)	Procurement of various textbooks and instructional materials for the Main and Siaton campuses amounting to ₱7,567,343.51 and P1,187,341.98, respectively were paid despite incomplete documentation and non-compliance with the general conditions of the contract, contrary to Section 5, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, Article III of the Contract Agreements and Section IV of the General Conditions of the Contract, thus the validity of the disbursements cannot be established. 

		

	We recommended and Management, thru the University President, agreed to instruct the University Accountant to ensure the completeness of the supporting documents prior to payment and require the immediate submission of the lacking documents, otherwise the disbursements will be suspended in audit.  Moreover, he should also require the BAC to submit a written explanation why they indorsed for approval the supplier’s request for extension of the delivery period even if these were not in accordance with Section IV of the General Conditions of the Contract.



4)	Paid disbursement vouchers, payrolls, and other transaction documents for Calendar Year 2020 amounting P1,183,194,813.38 were not submitted to the Audit Team intact and within the prescribed period contrary to Section 7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, precluding timely audit, the results of which could have been useful information for management in their decision-making. 



We recommended, and Management thru the Campus Administrators, agreed to require the Campus Cashier and the Campus Accountant to immediately submit the disbursement vouchers, payrolls, and financial reports pursuant to COA Circular No. 2009-006, otherwise the sanctions under Section 122 of P.D. No. 1445 shall be strictly imposed.  We also recommended that the University Accountant ensure that the campus accountants have already completed the submission of their transaction documents for the current year before they assist in consolidating the University’s financial statements.  We further recommended for the augmentation of personnel in the Campus Cashier’s Office so that the sorting and preparation of transaction documents for submission to the Campus Accountant’s Office can be done in an efficient and timely manner. 

	

5)	Supplies, materials and equipment needed for the prevention of the spread of the COVID-19 virus in the total amount of  ₱915,738.59  were charged to the Special Trust Fund contrary to Section 4(d) of Republic Act No. 8292, its Implementing Rules and Regulations and Article III of CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, series of 2011, thus the validity of the disbursements cannot be established.



We recommended and Management, thru the Campus Administrator, agreed to instruct the campus officials concerned to discontinue charging unrelated expenses to the Special Trust Fund and to instruct the Campus Accountant to transfer funds in the total amount of ₱915,738.59 from the General Fund 101 to the STF to replenish the latter.
