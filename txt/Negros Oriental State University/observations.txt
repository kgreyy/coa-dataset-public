PART II – OBSERVATIONS and RECOMMENDATIONS



A)	 Financial and Compliance Audit



1)	Payroll cash advances of the University Cashier granted in the prior and current year amounting to ₱26,275,323,76 and ₱18,690,301.57, respectively, remained unliquidated at year-end contrary to Item 5 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 and Sections 14c and 15, Chapter 6 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, thus affecting the fairness of presentation of the financial statements and increasing the risk of misappropriation or loss of government funds in his possession. 



	COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 prescribes the amended rules and regulations on the grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advance.  Item 5 thereof enumerates the guidelines on the liquidation of cash advances which and provides, among others, the following:



	5.1  The AO shall liquidate his cash advance as follows:



5.1.1  Salaries, Wages, etc. – within five (5) days after each fifteen (15) day/end of the month pay period.

    5.1.3 xxx.  Failure of the AO to liquidate his cash advance within the prescribed period shall constitute a valid cause for the withholding of his salary and the institution of other sanctions as provided for under paragraphs 9.2 and 9.3 thereof.” (Underscoring ours)



5.2  The AO shall prepare the Report of Disbursements x x x and submit the same with duly accomplished vouchers/payrolls and supporting documents to the Accountant.  X x x The AO shall be deemed to have complied with the requirement for proper accounting of the cash advance upon receipt by the Accountant of the liquidation documents.



5.3   Within ten (10) days after the receipt of the report and the supporting documents from the Accountable Officer, the Accountant shall verify the report, record it in the books and submit the same with all the vouchers/payrolls and supporting documents to the auditor.  The cash advance shall be considered liquidated upon the recording thereof by the accountant in the books of accounts although not yet audited by the COA Auditor. 



5.7  When a cash advance is no longer needed or has not been used for a period of two (2) months, it must be returned to or refunded immediately to the collecting officer.

 

5.8  All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at end of each year.  Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipt.” 



In our verification of the report on the Status of Unliquidated Cash Advances as of December 31, 2020, we noted that 69.80% or ₱44,965,635.33 out of the ₱64,415,638.56 total unliquidated cash advances of the NORSU Main Campus were lodged in the “Advances for Payroll” account. These were all unliquidated cash advances of the University Cashier amounting to ₱26,275,323.76 for the prior years and ₱18,690,301.57 for the current year, as shown in the following table:

Further verification showed that these payroll cash advances granted to the University Cashier in prior years and also in the current year which remained unliquidated to date pertained to the following :



1)	Payment of supplies and instructional materials for lecturers for CY 2018

2)	Collective Negotiation Agreement incentive of employees and retirees for CY 2018

3)	Tax refund for CY 2018

4)	Stipends of scholars of legislators, DOST, local government units, CHED Tulong Dunong, CHED STUFAP Tulong Dunong, Seeds Jollibee, Lifebank Foundation, Inc., TES-UNIFAST for CYs 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020

5)	Honoraria of graduate school professors, BAC members, BAC Secretariat and TWG for CY 2020 and of student teaching mentors for CY 2018

6)	Proportional vacation pay of faculty members

7)	Wages of guest lecturers for CYs 2019 and 2020 

8)	Tax refund of retired employees for CY 2019

9)	Honorarium of checkers of comprehensive examination of masteral and doctoral students for CYs 2018 and 2019

10)	Overload pay of instructors for CY 2020









11)	Refund of tuition and miscellaneous fee for CYs 2017, 2018 and 2019

12)	Wages of student assistants for CY 2020

13)	Honorarium of Commandant and staff and purchase of supplies for Naval ROTC Unit for CYs 2018 and 2019



The University Cashier explained that the non-settlement of the foregoing cash advances was due to the fact that many of the payees specially the University’s scholars were not able to claim their stipends because they had either already graduated from the University or were already gainfully employed.  Another reason he cited was the inability of the payees to personally go to his office due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Finally, he added that he also encountered difficulty in contacting the payees especially those that are no longer connected with the University.  



However, he informed us that based on the records of his Office, his unliquidated cash advances as of December 31, 2020 amounted to ₱49,239,068.14 which shows a difference of ₱4,237,442.81 from the Accounting Office records of only ₱44,965,625.33.



We also interviewed the University Accountant regarding the substantial outstanding balance of unliquidated cash advances for payroll at year-end and asked her whether her office was monitoring the liquidations made by the University Cashier but she answered in the negative because they were more focused on the daily recording and processing of University transactions and the preparation and submission of required reports from oversight government agencies such as CHED, DBM and COA.  She also said they were also pressed for time in processing disbursement of funds given to the University from out of the General Appropriations Act which had to be completed by year-end.  However, she informed us that in one of their collegiate meetings, the University Cashier had already been instructed by her and the Chief Administrative Officer for Finance to settle his unliquidated payroll cash advances before the end of the year but he was not able to do so.



We asked the University Cashier why he did not liquidate his payroll cash advances at year-end and he replied that although he was aware of the existing rules and regulations on the liquidation of cash advances for payroll they were busy with other official cashiering duties and responsibilities that also needs his undivided attention.



The non-liquidation and/or failure of the University Cashier and the Accounting Office to enforce the liquidation of cash advances for payroll specially if these had already been partially paid in prior years affects the fairness of presentation of the financial statements because the related expenses were understated since these were not recorded in the year when actually incurred while the receivable account was also overstated.  Likewise, delaying the liquidation and holding the unclaimed money in the possession of the accountable officer opens up opportunities for misuse or misapplication of the cash he is keeping in his vault and increases the risk of possible loss of the government funds in his possession.

Finally, the University Cashier furnished the Audit Team a statement of his Unliquidated Cash Advances for Payroll as of December 31, 2020 showing full settlements made by him on February 9, 2021, April 12, 2021, and April 13, 2021.  We verified and noted the same with the University Accounting Office that their records showed the following liquidations by the University Cashier, as follows:

We also noted that the total refunds amounting to ₱2,349,211.67 were deposited with the authorized depository bank on March 22, 23, 25, 26, and April 14, 2021. 



We are also concerned that the University Cashier’s refund of a significant portion of his cash advances which amounted to ₱2,349,211.67 in cash means that all this time, for the past years, he has been keeping such a big amount in his possession.  When we asked where he kept this money, he informed us that he just kept it inside his filing cabinet because the key of the vault used by his predecessors was not turned over to him.  However, we believe that keeping this huge amount just inside a steel filing cabinet instead of a vault is not ideal for obvious safety reasons.



Recommendation:



We recommended, and Management, thru the University President agreed to instruct the University Cashier to settle immediately all cash advances for payroll within five (5) days after the fifteenth day/end of the month pay period or when it has not been used for a period of two (2) months or at the end of each year. 



We also recommended that the University Accountant strictly monitor the submission by the University Cashier of his report of disbursements within the prescribed period and to recommend for the imposition of the withholding of his salary and other sanctions for failure to liquidate his cash advances on time.



Finally, we recommended that the University President instruct the University Cashier to use the vault instead of the steel filing cabinet to safeguard properly the funds for which he is primarily accountable.  





Management Comments:



The Acting Chief Administrative Officer for Finance replied that the University Cashier’s unliquidated cash advances for payroll were settled on April 30, 2021.  However, the liquidations are still subject to verification and post-audit by the audit team.  He added that he has also instructed an Accounting Office staff to monitor and check monthly the unliquidated payroll advances so that these can be liquidated on time.  



The University President also instructed the University Cashier and the Chief Administrative Officer for Finance to immediately request for the purchase of a new vault to be used in the Main campus and all external campuses, respectively.



2)	The amount of ₱13,226,094.35 representing transfers to the Main Campus of unexpected balances of funds appropriated for the purchase of equipment, athletic activities and other purposes of the Bayawan-Sta. Catalina and Siaton external campuses were erroneously recorded as an asset account contrary to Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies, Volume I and the 2019 updated Revised Chart of Accounts, thus affecting the fairness of presentation of the financial statements at year-end.



Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I covers among others, the basic accounting principles for financial reporting by national government agencies.



Sec. 15 thereof requires that the financial statements shall “present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSAS.”



PPSAS refers to the Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards which is prescribed by the Commission on Audit to be adopted by national government agencies and for which it issued a chart of accounts containing the list of accounts and their corresponding description.  The Revised Chart of Accounts for NGAs prescribed in COA Circular No. 2015-007 dated October 22, 2015 has been updated as Annex A of COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020.



In our verification of the financial statements as of December 31, 2020, we noted that the Bayawan Sta.-Catalina and Siaton external campuses carried a Due from Central Office account with a significant balance of ₱11,139,062.76 and ₱2,087,031.59, respectively. Both Campus Accountants informed us that when they assumed at their respective external campuses, this account was already existing but considering that there were no subsidiary records turned over to them, they have no personal knowledge about the nature of these receivables.





Further verification from the Bayawan-Sta. Catalina Campus Accountant disclosed that the said amount pertained to the unexpended fund balances of the external campus for the following purposes which was ordered by the Board of Regents to be remitted to the Main campus:

In the same manner, the Siaton Campus Accountant also disclosed that the said amount pertained to the unexpended fund balances from its Miscellaneous 164 (M164) Fund for purchase of equipment and expenses for athletics in connection with the State Colleges and Universities Athletic Association (SCUAA) which was ordered by the Board of Regents thru Resolution No. 30, s. of 2017, to be remitted to the Main campus.

2,087,031.59



However, the Campus Accountant added that entries by the Main Campus for the transfers made in CY 2016 still have to be verified because the reference documents are still being located.



The entries made in CY 2017 show that the fund transfers were recorded in the Bayawan-Sta. Catalina and Siaton Campus books by recognizing a receivable account, the Due from Central Office account, which is an asset account.  However, the 2019 Revised Chart of Accounts describes the Due from Central Office account as “used to recognize transfer of non-budgetary funds to the Central Office from the Regional Offices/Bureaus/Operating Units of NGAs.  This account is credited for receipt of payment, liquidation, adjustments, write-off, and/or adjustments.”



Our analysis of the transfer of these unexpended balances from the two  external campuses to the Main campus to be used by the latter for its own purposes as approved and instructed by the Board of Regents shows that there was no more intention on the part of the Main campus to replenish the external campuses.  Thus, the transfer cannot be deemed and recognized as a receivable on the part of the external campus because simply stated in accounting, receivables are considered as debts owed to an entity by its clients for goods or services that have already been delivered but not yet paid for.  In this case, although the funds were delivered to the Main campus, these are not going to be paid anymore.  In fact, our verification showed that since the fund transfer made in the year 2017, the Main Campus had not really paid back the external campuses nor are there any plans to do so.



Finally, the Main campus recognized the CY 2017 fund transfers in its books in the Subsidy from Other Funds account and not as a Due to Operating Units which is supposed to be the contra account of the Due from Central Office account used by the external campus.  The Main campus did not recognize a liability to the external campus and instead used a subsidy account which are presented in the Statement of Financial Performance as Financial Assistance/Subsidy and added to the Surplus from Current Operations with Other Non-Operating Income in order to get the net Surplus for the current period.  



Instead of the entry made to record an asset account, the appropriate entry would have been to record an expense to match the subsidy recorded by the Main campus.  As a University system whose financial statements are consolidated, the use by the Bayawan-Sta. Catalina and Siaton external campuses of the receivable account to record their fund transfer of P11,139,062.76 and P2,087,031.59 to the Main campus, respectively, has overstated both their assets and equity accounts, thus the financial statements are not fairly presented at year-end.



		

Recommendation:



We recommended and Management, thru the Campus Administrators, agreed to instruct the Campus Accountants and coordinate with the University Accountant to verify the fund transfer of unexpended balances to the Main campus in the prior years and prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the erroneous entry recording an invalid receivable account.





3)	Procurement of various textbooks and instructional materials for the Main and Siaton campuses amounting to ₱7,567,343.51 and P1,187,341.98, respectively were paid despite incomplete documentation and non-compliance with the general conditions of the contract, contrary to Section 5, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, Article III of the Contract Agreements and Section IV of the General Conditions of the Contract, thus the validity of the disbursements cannot be established. 



Section 5, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states that: 



“1. Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.



2.  All laws and regulations applicable to financial transactions shall be faithfully adhered to.”



In CY 2020, we noted that one of the completed projects of the NORSU Main Campus was the Supply and Delivery of Various Textbooks and Instructional Materials with an Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC) of ₱7,643,253.77 grouped into twenty five (25) lots.  



For the Siaton campus, our verification of the quarterly report on Government Projects/Programs/Activities (PPA) as of December 31, 2020, showed  that there was only one completed project and that is the Supply and Delivery of Various Textbooks and Instructional Materials with an Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC) of ₱1,199,485.97 grouped into twelve (12) lots.

However, in the post-audit of the disbursement vouchers and supporting documents, we noted the following:







Particulars

1.

The request of the four (4) Main campus and three (3) Siaton campus suppliers for substitute book titles did not conform to Article III of the approved contract agreements, specifically Paragraphs 4, 5 and 6.

2.

The reasons of the four (4) Main campus suppliers and two (2) Siaton campus suppliers requesting for extension of the delivery period are not one of the causes provided under Clause 22 of the General Conditions of the Contract that can be considered as Force Majeure or Fortuitous Event.





Our review of Article III of the Contract Agreements shows the following provisions:



“Par. 4-  If within the delivery period, the publisher declares an out of print for   specific   titles,  the   winning  bidder  shall  provide   a Certification from the Publisher indicating that the specific title(s) are already out of print.



Par.  5-  The winning bidder shall then submit a request for a substitute title to be approved by the End-user.



Par.6- The request for substitute title shall specify the related title(s) indicating the author and the copyright (same year or most recent).



Although the four (4) winning Main campus and three (3) winning Siaton campus bidders sent their written requests addressed to the End-user for the substitute titles of the textbooks for reasons that these were “out of stock” and/or “unavailable in the market”, they did not submit the required certification from the publishers indicating that the title(s) are already out of print and their requests were not stamped received by the End-user.  Moreover, for the Main campus, only the requests of Linar Educational Materials, Inc. and F & J De Jesus, Inc. for the substitution of book titles had the approval of the End-user.

		

Further verification of the letter requests also showed non-compliance with the requirement in Par. 6 above.

The requests for extension were approved based on the indorsement letters of the BAC Chairman to the University President citing the provision of Section IV, Item 18.2 of the General Conditions of the Contract (GCC) of the Philippine Bidding Documents (PBD), to wit:



	“If at any time during the performance of this Contract, the Supplier or its subcontractor(s) should encounter conditions impending timely delivery of the Goods and or performance of Services, the Supplier shall promptly notify the Procuring Entity in writing of the fact of the delay, its likely duration and its cause(s).  As soon as practicable after receipt of the Supplier’s notice, and upon causes provided for under GCC Clause 22, the PE shall evaluate the situation and may extend the Supplier’s time for performance, in which case the extension shall be ratified by the parties by amendments of Contract.”



	After careful reading of the reason/s for requesting extension cited by the suppliers, we are not convinced that these falls within the purview of force majeure events as provided for under GCC Clause 22.  Force Majeure is an event that cannot be reasonably anticipated or controlled.  For purposes of the contract entered into, by and between NORSU and the winning bidders, the terms “force majeure” and “fortuitous event” may be used interchangeably.  If and when the cause of an event is man-made, such as war, strike, lockdown, etc., it is Force Majeure while if an event is due to natural occurrence, like an earthquake, typhoon, volcanic eruption and the like, it is Fortuitous Event.  



The reasons cited by the winning bidders could also have been avoided with the exercise of reasonable diligence on their part.  Reasonable diligence is simply the determination and careful effort to carry out a responsibility or to meet a standard of care. In this respect, the delivery delays could have been avoided had the suppliers been extra conscious of the delivery time schedule as agreed upon in the approved contract agreement.  



Finally, we also noted that the extensions were not ratified by the parties by amendments to the contract contrary to the aforecited provision in Section IV, Item 18.2 of the GCC, thus making the extensions unenforceable.



		Non-compliance by the suppliers with the terms of the contract as stipulated in Article III and Section IV of the General Conditions thereof makes it difficult to establish the validity of the payments made to the suppliers because the reasons for the delayed deliveries are not valid and the disbursements were not also adequately supported with required documents.



The University Accountant explained to us that they have overlooked and will revisit and review the contract agreements.  She added that she had also already informed the BAC that the approved contract agreements need to be ratified by having the amendments incorporated into the amended contract agreements.  She also promised to take note of the valid reasons allowed by existing rules and regulations on the request and grant of time extensions and informed the University President about these developments for his information, guidance and future course of action when similar transactions occur.  She further explained that with regards to the need for a certification from the publisher for out of print textbook titles, they will try to do their best to require the suppliers to comply by submitting the said requirements. 

		

Similar observations were also noted in other external campuses (with the exception of the Mabinay Campus) regarding the procurement of textbooks and instructional materials.  The audit team has already started verifying the contracts and related documents including disbursement vouchers of the other campuses and will inform management the results of our audit thereon accordingly.

	

Recommendation:



	We recommended and Management, thru the University President, agreed to instruct the University Accountant to ensure the completeness of the supporting documents prior to payment and require the immediate submission of the lacking documents, otherwise the disbursements will be suspended in audit.  Moreover, he should also require the BAC to submit a written explanation why they indorsed for approval the supplier’s request for extension of the delivery period even if these were not in accordance with Section IV of the General Conditions of the Contract.

	

	

	Management Comments:

	

	The University Accountant and the Chief Administrative Officer for Finance replied that they have already requested the University Librarian to communicate with the suppliers to immediately submit the lacking documents.

	

	On the other hand, the Bids and Awards Committee replied that upon receipt of the suppliers’ letters requesting for extension of delivery, their evaluation of the reasons cited led them to determine that these were cases beyond the former’s control and therefore considered as force majeure.  They also determined that the suppliers exercised due diligence because they immediately ordered the items awarded upon their receipt of the Notice to Proceed but some of the books still have to be imported and the immediate availability and delivery of the items for shipping by international forwarders is also beyond the control of the supplier.

	

	Auditor’s Rejoinder:

	

	In order to avoid the recurrence of similar situations for future procurement transactions involving importation of goods, the BAC should determine the supplier’s availability of stocks on hand and the time required to order from their foreign sources so that these and other important factors can be considered in the decision to award including the terms and conditions to include in the contract so that the procurement will still be advantageous to the government.





4)	Paid disbursement vouchers, payrolls, and other transaction documents for Calendar Year 2020 amounting P1,183,231,902.38 were not submitted to the Audit Team intact and within the prescribed period contrary to Section 7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, precluding timely audit, the results of which could have been useful information for management in their decision-making. 

 

Section 7.2.1 (a) of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 provides as follows: 



“The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that: 



a)	The reports and supporting documents submitted by the accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month.”







We reviewed our records and noted that as of December 31, 2020 all of the campuses still had unsubmitted check, cash disbursement and collection transaction documents in the total amount of  P1,183,194,813.38 as follows (see Annex A for details):

It was noted that although some of the transaction documents for CY 2020 were submitted to the audit team on various dates in CY 2021, submission was not yet complete and there are still many CY 2020 transactions not received by the audit team to date.  



The delayed submission of transaction documents precluded the audit team from performing timely audits on transactions, the results of which could have been immediately brought to the attention of management for decision-making or for any other appropriate action.



The above observation has been recurring and has been communicated to Management verbally, through Audit Observations Memoranda and even included in prior years’  Management Letters but since no concrete action has been taken, we are reiterating the same because the situation is still prevailing and the amount of unsubmitted transactions is still quite significant.



The Campus Accountants who are responsible for the submission of the paid disbursement vouchers and transaction documents to the audit team cited the following common reasons why they always cannot submit within the prescribed period:



1)	The Campus Cashier also incurred delays in submitting to the Campus Accountant’s Office the various paid disbursement vouchers (DVs) and collection reports;

2)	After receipt of the said DVs, the Accounting Office personnel still have to review the individual DVs for completeness of supporting documents which takes time and if submission of the Cashier is delayed, it also adds up to the delayed submission by the Accounting Office to the audit team;

3)	The Bayawan-Sta. Catalina and Mabinay Campus Accountants are also assisting the University Accountant in preparing the University’s consolidated financial statements and notes; and 

4)	The campus accountants also have a regular teaching load.



On the other hand, the campus cashiers also explained that they cannot immediately submit the paid disbursement vouchers and collection reports with the official receipts to the accounting office because of the following reasons:



1)	There is a lack of personnel in the Cashier’s Office to assist in reviewing the supporting documents for completeness and sorting the same for submission to the accounting office;

2)	The campus cashiers travel to the Main campus on official business on a regular basis in order to process the salaries and wages of campus personnel and remit to the BIR, Philhealth and other government agencies; and

3)	Some required supporting documents especially official receipts of suppliers and other creditors are not submitted immediately after payment and the cashier has to wait for a long time before the payees send the ORs.



Finally, considering that the delayed submission of disbursement vouchers and other transaction documents has always been brought to management’s attention but to date no concrete action has been made, we are again discussing the matter and also reminding all officials concerned that pursuant to Section 122 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 or the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents and reports to the Commission on Audit shall automatically cause the suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have complied with the requirements of the latter.



	Recommendation:



We recommended, and Management thru the Campus Administrators, agreed to require the Campus Cashier and the Campus Accountant to immediately submit the disbursement vouchers, payrolls, and financial reports pursuant to COA Circular No. 2009-006, otherwise the sanctions under Section 122 of P.D. No. 1445 shall be strictly imposed.  We also recommended that the University Accountant ensure that the campus accountants have already completed the submission of their transaction documents for the current year before they assist in consolidating the University’s financial statements.  We further recommend for the augmentation of personnel in the Campus Cashier’s Office so that the sorting and preparation of transaction documents for submission to the Campus Accountant’s Office can be done in an efficient and timely manner. 



5)	Supplies, materials and equipment needed for the prevention of the spread of the COVID-19 virus in the total amount of  ₱915,738.59  were charged to the Special Trust Fund contrary to Section 4(d) of Republic Act No. 8292, its Implementing Rules and Regulations and Article III of CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, series of 2011, thus the validity of the disbursements cannot be established.



Section 4(d) of R.A. No. 8292 or the Higher Education Act of 1997 provides that: “x xx any income generated by the university or college from tuition fees and other charges, as well from the operation of auxiliary services and land grants, shall be retained by the university or college, and may be disbursed by the Board of Regents/Trustees for instruction, research, extension, or other programs/projects of the university or college:  Provided, That all fiduciary fees shall be disbursed for the specific purposes for which they are collected.” (Emphasis ours) 



The foregoing provision is also reiterated in Section 18 (d) of CHED Memorandum Circular No. 3, series of 2001 which contains the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 8292.



Moreover, Sections 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16, Article III of CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, series of 2011 provides the Specific Budgetary Allocation of the Special Trust Fund (STF), as follows:  



1)	Faculty and Staff Development

2)	Curriculum Development

3)	Student Development

4)	Facilities Development

5)	Research Services

6)	Extension Services

7)	Production

8)	Administrative Services

9)	Reserve



In our post-audit of transactions for CY 2020, we noted that supplies, materials and equipment purchased in response to the COVID-19 pandemic amounting to ₱325,168.59 in the Bayawan-Sta. Catalina campus and ₱590,570.00 in the Guihulngan campus or a total of P915,738.59 were charged to the Special Trust Fund (STF 164) as follows:

However, the use of the STF for the aforesaid procurement is contrary to the provisions of the Higher Education Act of 1997 and its IRR because the special trust fund shall be utilized only for the specific purposes for which these are collected and CHED Memorandum No. 20 which lists down the specific budgetary allocations for the STF does not specifically include the procurement of medical supplies and materials in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus the validity of the disbursements cannot be established.



The Bayawan-Sta. Catalina Campus Accountant explained that it was the designated Campus Nurse who made the request and since the Campus Clinic had insufficient balance of appropriation for the purchase of medical supplies and materials, the former suggested to the latter to request for approval that the unused appropriation for Training Expenses in the STF 164 be realigned and utilized for the procurement of the said medical supplies and materials. 

				

On the other hand, the Guihulngan Campus Accountant also explained that it was the Campus Administrator who made the request and since the Campus had no adequate appropriations for these, the Campus Administrator also requested that the unused appropriations for the construction of the New Academic Building-Phase 1 amounting to ₱7,492,150.00 be realigned and utilized for the procurement of these equipment, supplies and materials which was approved by the Board of Regents in its Resolution No. 32, series of 2020.  In fact, other supplies purchased by the campus in response to the pandemic in CY 2021 were also included in the said resolution.  



Thus, even if the realignment of funds for the foregoing procurements were approved by the Board and Campus Administrator, the use of the STF for the purpose is tantamount to unauthorized disbursement and has also caused the depletion of the latter by the total amount of ₱898,318.85 which could have been used for its truly lawful purposes.



Since the fiduciary fund should be disbursed only for the specific purpose for which it was collected and the STF is intended only for instruction, research, extension or other programs/projects which are necessary for the attainment of the goals and objectives of the Campus in particular and the University in general which is primarily to provide quality education, the expense for supplies, materials and equipment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic should have been charged to its regular agency budget. It could also utilize the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund (DRRMF) which the agency is allowed to provide as mandated in the General Appropriations Act (GAA) so that it can properly prepare and appropriately respond to impending disasters and calamities.



Recommendation:



We recommended and Management, thru the Campus Administrator, agreed to instruct the campus officials concerned to discontinue charging unrelated expenses to the Special Trust Fund and to instruct the Campus Accountant to transfer funds in the total amount of P915,738.59 from the General Fund 101 to the STF to replenish the latter. 





6)	Monthly honoraria paid to the Office of the Solicitor General for legal services rendered to the University amounting to ₱804,000.00 for the period January to December 2020 and ₱1,264,681.82 for CYs 2017 to 2019 were not supported with official receipts to acknowledge the payments contrary to COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 while a portion thereof in the total amount of ₱1,428,681.82 was also charged to the Special Trust Fund contrary to Section 4(d) of Republic Act No. 8292, its Implementing Rules and Regulations and Article III of CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, series of 2011, thus the validity of the disbursements cannot be established.



	COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 enumerates the documentary requirements for common government transactions and the general requirements for all types of disbursements which includes, among others, that claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation and that there should be sufficient and relevant documents to establish validity of the claim.  The same requirements are reiterated in Section 5, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs, Volume I.



Meanwhile, Section 4(d) of R.A. No. 8292 or the “Higher Education Act of 1997”provides that: “x xx any income generated by the university or college from tuition fees and other charges, as well from the operation of auxiliary services and land grants, shall be retained by the university or college, and may be disbursed by the Board of Regents/Trustees for instruction, research, extension, or other programs/projects of the university or college:  Provided, That all fiduciary fees shall be disbursed for the specific purposes for which they are collected.” (Emphasis ours) This is also reiterated in Section 18 (d) of CHED Memorandum Circular No. 3, series of 2001 which contains the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 8292.







Finally, Sections 6, 8, and 10, Article III of CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, series of 2011 provides the Specific Budgetary Allocation of the Special Trust Fund (STF), as follows:  



1)	Faculty and Staff Development

3)	Student Development

5)	Research Services

6)	Extension Services

In our post-audit of the University’s transactions for CY 2020, we noted that the Negros Oriental State University (NORSU) entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Office of the Solicitor General for the period January 2 to December 31, 2020 to, among others, represent the former in various courts and/or other administrative tribunals/bodies, handle civil and administrative cases filed by or against NORSU and its officials in connection with the performance  of their official duties and provide legal services and render written advice/opinions on cases submitted to the latter.



The MOA also provides that the NORSU shall, subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, give a monthly honorarium in the total amount of ₱67,000.00 to officials of the OSG to be sourced from the General Fund 101 and Special Trust Fund 164 – Tuition for Administrative Services, shown in the following table:



Solicitor General

₱11,000.00

Assistant Solicitor General (2 at ₱10,000.00 each)

20,000.00

Lawyers (4 at ₱9,000.00 each)

36,000.00



TOTAL



₱67,000.00

 

The foregoing honoraria is to be paid through checks payable to the Office of the Solicitor General or directly credited or deposited to its Fund 101 OSG LBP account, Paseo de Roxas Branch.



We also noted that it was not just for CY 2020 that a MOA between NORSU and the OSG was drawn.  Our audit showed that the agreement between the University and the OSG started way back in CY 2017 and every year thereafter.  Examination of the MOAs from 2017 to 2019 revealed that the monthly honorarium rates which were all pre-determined by the OSG, varied each year, as follows:

	Our examination of the disbursement vouchers (DVs) covering the payment of the monthly allowances for the OSG lawyers for the current and previous years, which were deposited to the OSG’s account in accordance with the MOA, showed the following deficiencies:



1)	No official receipts were issued by the OSG to acknowledge receipt of the payments made by NORSU contrary to Section 68 of P.D. No. 1445;



2)	The monthly allowances for the OSG were charged to the appropriations for Professional Services in both Fund 101 and in the STF.  However, the use of the STF for giving monthly honorarium to the OSG is contrary to the provisions of the Higher Education Act of 1997 and its IRR because the special trust fund shall be utilized only for the specific purposes for which these are collected and CHED Memorandum No. 20 which lists down the specific budgetary allocations for the STF does not specifically include honoraria for OSG personnel.



3)	Honoraria for the period July 31, 2018 of two (2) OSG lawyers who acted as resource persons in a forum attended by NORSU officials were directly given to them instead of deposited to the OSG account contrary to the provision contained in the MOA.



4)	Honoraria of OSG lawyers for the period October to December 2017 was in the form of a cash advance by the University Cashier who encashed the check and made a corresponding cash deposit of the amount to the OSG’s Land Bank account contrary also to the provision in the MOA requiring the deposit of the check and not cash.

	

	The University Accountant explained that the fiduciary fund should be disbursed only for the specific purpose for which it was collected and the STF is intended only for instruction, research, extension, or other programs/projects of the University which are necessary for the attainment of the University’s goals and objectives to provide quality education.  However, it was used for the OSG’S honoraria because the University Budget Officer determined that said honoraria can be charged to the STF 164-Tuition for Administrative Services.



On the other hand, the University Cashier also explained that while the honoraria of the OSG officials for the period October to December 2017 was in his name because he was made to draw a cash advance therefor, he thought that this was not in accordance with the provision of the MOA requiring the University to deposit the checks in the name of the OSG direct to the OSG’s bank account.  The University Accountant explain that the University Cashier pushed through with the encashment of the check representing the said OSG honoraria and deposited it to the OSG’s LBP bank account after the University received follow-ups from the OSG about their honoraria.  However, it was only after the said transaction had been consummated that the NORSU BOR Secretary informed the University Accountant as well as the University Cashier of the OSG’s request that the University deposit the check directly to their bank account. 



However, in view of the absence of the Official Receipts from the OSG to acknowledge the payments made by NORSU for the past four (4) years the validity of the payments cannot be established.  In addition, the use of the STF to pay the OSG honorarium amounting to ₱1,428,681.82 is tantamount to unauthorized disbursements and has also caused the depletion of the latter by the same amount which could have been used for its truly lawful purposes.















Recommendation:



We recommended and Management, thru the University President and Accountant, agreed to immediately request the OSG to issue official receipts to acknowledge the monthly payments for honoraria deposited to their Land Bank account amounting to ₱804,000.00 for CY 2020 and ₱1,264,681.82 for CYs 2017-2019 including other subsequent payments made in the succeeding year 2021, if any and to also transfer funds amounting to ₱1,428,681.82 from the General Fund 101 to the STF to replenish the latter.  He should also instruct the University personnel concerned to henceforth, request for the OSG’s official receipts after every payment made to them and to use the STF only for the specific purposes for which it was created. 



Management Comment:



The University Accountant informed that they have already communicated to the Office of the Solicitor General regarding the Official Receipts and they were assured that these will be mailed to their office immediately.  In addition, during the exit conference, the University President informed and showed the  ORs which he just recently received from the OSG.

		

 The University Accountant and the Acting Chief Administrative Officer for Finance also replied that the funding source for the OSG honorarium may vary depending on the availability of funds and that the Budget Officer charged the OSG’s honoraria to the STF due to insufficient available funds in the General Fund because CHED Memorandum Order No. 20 s. 2011 provides that tuition fees may be used by SUCs in carrying out its trifocal function of instruction, research and extension, and production as well as defray its administrative costs (general administrative support).  According to them, the budgetary allocation for administrative services which is 10% of tuition fees may be allocated for such other maintenance and operating expenses necessary for the effective and efficient delivery of general administrative support services as contribution to the attainment of the mission, vision, goals and objective of the State College.  However, during the exit conference, the Acting Chief Administrative Officer for Finance informed that he will also submit a written query to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) on the use of the STF for the OSG’s honoraria.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



While we appreciate Management’s immediate action to request the OSG for the Official Receipts in acknowledgment of the payments made to them which were probably just inadvertently not mailed to NORSU right away, we still maintain that the charging of the honoraria to the STF is not in accordance with CHED Memorandum No. 20 s. 2017.  Although allowable budgetary allocations for the STF may include administrative services, it is an established principle of government  disbursements that trust funds should always be spent for their specific purposes and unless there are specific guidelines issued by CHED providing that the administrative services contemplated when the STF was established includes honoraria for OSG lawyers, it is a more appropriate charge to the General Fund instead of to the Special Trust Fund unless the DBM will allow the same in reply to management’s query. 



 

7)	Dormant accounts in the Siaton external campus with a total balance of ₱730,741.68 were not reverted to the General Fund of the Bureau of Treasury, contrary to Executive Order No. 431, s. 2005 and may result to possible depletion of funds through the imposition of bank dormancy charges. 



Executive Order No. 431 dated May 30, 2005, orders the reversion of all dormant accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds to the General Fund and for other purposes.  It mandates the Permanent Committee (PC) to examine, look into and evaluate all existing cash deposits of whatever nature, whether foreign or local currency, maintained outside of the Bureau of the Treasury with authorized government depository banks and other institutions by departments, bureaus and all other agencies of the National Government.



In addition, Section 1 of EO No. 431 provides that the Permanent Committee (PC) created pursuant to Section 45, Chapter 5, Book VI of the Administrative Code of 1987 shall consist of the Secretary of Finance (DOF) as Chairman, Secretary of Budget and Management (DBM), and the Chairman of the Commission on Audit (COA), as members. 



Moreover, COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015 which prescribes the guidelines and procedures in the Reversion to the General Fund of all Dormant Cash, Unauthorized Accounts, Unnecessary Special and Trust Funds and Related Accounts, in conformity with Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012, implementing Executive Order No. 431, dated May 30, 2005 instructs the head of the accounting unit of the National Government Agency to conduct a thorough analysis of the cash accounts which have remained inactive or those with no transactions.  



We analyzed the cash accounts of the NORSU Siaton Campus as of December 31, 2020 and noted that the following have already become dormant as follows:



Fund

Account Balance

Senior High School (SHS)

₱700,667.49

General Fund 101

30,074.19

Total

₱730,741.68



Our verification showed that on August 8, 2016, the Board of Regents (BOR) approved BOR Resolution No. 57, s. of 2016, approving the opening of new accounts for the different NORSU external campuses in their respective Land Bank of the Philippines branches solely for the Senior High School (SHS) Voucher Program.  Thus, the Siaton Campus opened a separate account for it.	

We further verified that the University stopped offering the Senior High School program in SY 2018.  Based on the bank statement, the last SHS transaction for the Siaton Campus was in August 2018 and the account has remained inactive since then.  As of December 31, 2020, there is a balance of ₱700,667.49.  The Acting Chief of Finance informed us that he was not aware that the account was already dormant.  He added that they are still waiting for guidelines from the Dep. Ed. On how to treat the remaining SHS fund balance.



With regard to the General Fund 101 (GF 101), the Campus Cashier/Disbursing Officer informed us that in prior years, when they received cash allocations from the Main Campus, this was deposited to the Miscellaneous 164 Fund account.  However, the former University Accountant instructed them to have a separate account for the GF 101.  On October 9, 2017, the Campus Cashier/Disbursing Officer opened an account with the LBP for the GF 101 with an initial deposit of ₱30,000.00 but after opening, the release of the cash allocations to NORSU Siaton was discontinued.   The Campus Accountant then informed the former Budget Officer at the Main Campus that their account was already inactive.  On December 10, 2018, a subsidy was released by the Main Campus to the Siaton Campus but when the Campus Cashier/Disbursing Officer went to the bank to deposit the check, the bank employee informed her that the account was already dormant so she instead deposited it again to the Fund M164 account. At present, they no longer receive checks for subsidy because only the Main Campus processes the claims for MOOE as well as the salaries for NORSU Siaton employees. 



Because the two accounts are already considered as dormant, there is a possibility that the bank will soon impose dormancy charges which will lead to the gradual decrease in the outstanding balances, unless these are reverted back to the Bureau of Treasury pursuant to EO No. 431.



Recommendation:



We recommended and Management, thru the Campus Administrator, agreed to instruct the Campus Accountant to verify the two dormant accounts and comply with the provisions of EO No. 431 s. 2005 on the reversion of all dormant accounts, if warranted.

	

	

8)	The Mabinay Campus hired a Project Engineer employed by the local government unit whose functions are also performed by the University Engineering Office contrary to Item 7 of both CSC-COA-DBM JC No. 1, s. 2018 and COA-DBM JC No. 2, s. 2020. 

Item 7 of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2017 provides the Rules and Regulations governing Contract of Service and Job Order Workers in Government. Item 7 thereof lists the limitations as follows:



7.1 	Hiring under contract of serviced shall be limited to consultants, learning service providers, and/or other technical experts to undertake special    or job within specific period.  The project or job is not part of the regular functions of the agency, x x x”

	7.2    x   x  x	

7.3  Contract of service and job order workers should not, in any case, be made to perform functions which are part of the job description of the agency’s existing regular employees.

7.4   x x x” 

		

	The above limitations are also reiterated in COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2, s. 2020.

	

In our post-audit of the Mabinay campus’s transactions, we noted that an engineer employed by the local government unit (LGU) of Mabinay was hired by the University President as part-time Project Engineer under a Contract of Service dated June 13, 2019 effective on the date of the contract unless revoked by the latter and Job Order authorization dated December 13, 2020 for the period from December 13, 2020 to June 12, 2021. 



Our audit further showed that in her letter dated May 24, 2019 to the University President recommending the LGU Engineer to the position, the Campus Administrator stressed that the engineer will be reporting after office hours from 5:30pm to 8pm and every Saturday from 9am-12nn and 1:00 to 4pm excluding holidays.  



Results of audit showed that total payments made to the Project Engineer as of December 31, 2020 amounted to ₱178,002.50 which were charged to the appropriation for Other Professional Services in the General Fund of the Main Campus and the Tuition Fund 164 of the Mabinay Campus, as follows:

The letter of the Campus Administrator to the University President mentioned that the purpose of hiring the Project Engineer was to expedite the implementation of existing infrastructure projects of the NORSU Mabinay Campus.  However, our verification of the University’s quarterly report on government projects as of December 31, 2020 showed that two campus projects  started on December 29, 2017 and February 11, 2019 which, per contract and approved program of work were expected to be completed on August 26, 2018 and June 11, 2019 (with request of extension up to November 9, 2019), respectively, still remained unfinished at year-end with an accomplishment of only 97.39% and 94.19%, respectively.  Therefore, the objective in hiring the Project Engineer to fast track project implementation was not attained.



Moreover, we also noted that the University has a University Engineering Office headed by a University Engineer, who is a regular employee responsible for the management of the University’s buildings, facilities and grounds, ensure compliance with health, life safety and building codes, and recommend priorities for needed repairs and renovation. 



 The University Engineer’s Office also has the following staff:

--	One temporary office staff who supervises the draftsmen, files and approves architectural plans

--	Three engineers with casual appointment who make program estimation, scope of work of infrastructure projects and monitor project site and do structural analysis

--	Three job order draftsmen who draw architectural and engineering plans for the various infrastructure projects of NORSU

--	One job order office clerk who prepare and process documents, organize and maintain files, handle correspondence and organize the office

It is also noted that the duties and functions of the University Engineering Office is not limited to the Main campus only but also extends to the external campuses because they prepare and sign the documents pertaining to external campus projects including reports on status of projects. 



Finally, we also noted the following deficiencies in the post-audit of the payments made to the LGU Project Engineer:

1)	On the contract of service/job order contract:

a)	The working hours were not specified

b)	The period covered was not indicated

c)	The duties and responsibilities were not listed



2)	The disbursement vouchers were not supported with verified accomplishment reports of the Project Engineer



3)	The disbursement vouchers were not supported with the written permission from the head of agency that the LGU Engineer is allowed to engage in the practice of her profession and the conditions required in Sec. 136 of the CSC 2017 Omnibus Rules on Appointments.

 In view of the foregoing, the hiring of another engineer as project engineer for the Mabinay campus runs contrary to Item 7 of the foregoing Joint Circulars because the work to be done by the project engineer is part of the regular functions of the University Engineer and his Office.  Thus, unnecessary expenses amounting to P178,002.50 were incurred by the Mabinay Campus and the University which they could have used instead for their operations.

		

The audit team also noted that other external campuses were also hiring LGU engineers and the same deficiencies were observed.



During the exit conference, the University President explained that it was actually his suggestion that the external campuses hire the services of the LGU engineers because the University Engineer’s Office cannot actually cope up with the workload due to the increasing number of infrastructure projects implemented in the Main and external campuses.  Considering also the distance of the external campuses from the Main campus, the University Engineer’s staff cannot immediately supervise and inspect the projects being implemented.  However, he admitted that there were some provisions in the terms of the contract of service which needed amendments and that the LGU engineers should be granted authority by their respective local chief executives to exercise their profession outside of their regular working hours, otherwise, the University cannot hire them.



Recommendation:

We recommended and Management, thru the University President, agreed to discontinue hiring the LGU engineer as Project Engineer of the Mabinay campus unless the local chief executive grants her authority to exercise her profession after regular working hours.  In addition, the contract of service should also be amended to include the details of her working hours, duties and expected outputs.  The Campus Administrator should also instruct the Campus Accountant to support the disbursement vouchers with adequate documents to establish the validity of the payments made.

	

	

9)	Payments for hazard pay of the Guihulngan Campus School Nurse amounting to ₱62,018.46 for CY 2020 were not supported with the documentary requirements prescribed in Section 5.8 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, thus the validity and propriety of the disbursements could not be ascertained. 

	

Hazard pay, as defined in Section 3.1 of DBM-DOH Joint Circular No. 1 series of 2016 is “an additional compensation for performing hazardous duties and for enduring physical hardships in the course of the performance of duties.”

 

Furthermore, Section 21 of R.A. No. 7305 provides that hazard pay maybe granted to PHWs if the nature of their duties and responsibilities, their actual services, and location of work expose them to great danger, occupational risks, perils to life, and physical hardships, as determined by the Secretary of Health, or by the Head of the Agency or the Local Chief Executive, with the approval of the Secretary of Health.



Section 5.8 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribes the following documentary requirements for the payment of hazard pay:



□  Certification by the Secretary of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST)/Department of Health (DOH)/Department of National Defense (DND)Director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology that the place of assignment/travel is a strife-torn/embattled/disease-infested/distressed or isolated areas/stations, or areas under state of calamity or emergency, or with volcanic activity and/or eruption

□   Duly accomplished time record of employees or travel report

□   Copy of special order from the agency/department head covering the assignment to hazardous/difficult areas

□  Approved DTR/Service Report

		

In our post audit of transactions of the NORSU Main Campus for CY 2020, we noted that the School Nurse of the Guihulngan external campus, whose salary and allowances were paid by NORSU Main Campus, was granted hazard duty pay in the total amount of ₱62,018.46 as follows:

						  TOTAL			₱62,018.46	



Our examination of the three (3) disbursement vouchers (DVs) showed that these were not supported with complete documentation and lacked the following required documents:



1)	Certification by the Secretary of the Department of Health (DOH)/Secretary of the Department of National Defense that the place of assignment is a strife-torn/embattled/disease-infested area/station, or area under state of calamity or emergency; and

2)	 Duly accomplished time record of the School Nurse for the months of January to March, July to September, October,  and December 2020.



The School Nurse explained that she was exposed on a daily basis to a risk of contracting the unseen COVID-19 virus while in the performance of her official duties and responsibilities as a public health worker since she catered while on duty to the health needs of the students, teaching and non-teaching personnel of the Guihulngan Campus everyday.   The danger of getting infected was always present even if she was following to the letter the health protocols set forth in the various issuances of the National, Regional, Provincial and City Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases.  She also averred that during the onslaught of the COVID-19 virus in CY 2020, her position and designation as the School Nurse  is in itself hazardous since she is a frontliner  and the sole public health worker of the Guihulngan Campus not to mention the limited resources of the campus relative to the provision of protective equipments. 



The accounting personnel who processed her claims for hazard pay also explained that they thought all the while that the DVs were already fully supported and claimed that they were not aware of the requirements prescribed in Section 5.8 of COA Circular No. 2012-001.



While it is common knowledge that Guihulngan City may be considered as a dangerous area due to the prevailing peace and order problems thereat, the payment of hazard pay is not automatic because eligibility of public health workers to receive such pay as laid down in RA 7305 is to be determined and approved by the Secretary of Health or his duly authorized representative taking into consideration such other factors as the number of working hours exposure to such risk.  Otherwise, the absence of documents approving the PHW’s entitlement to the hazard pay and evidence of the hours of exposure to such hazards makes it difficult to ascertain the propriety and validity of the hazard pay claim.



Recommendation:



We recommended and Management, thru the University President , agreed to require the Campus Administrator of the Guihulngan Campus  and the University Accountant to instruct the School Nurse to support her claims of Hazard Pay with the documentary requirements prescribed in Section 5.8 of COA Circular No. 2021-001 dated June 14, 2012. 





10)	Reimbursement of travelling allowances which were not in accordance with University Memorandum No. 15, s. 2019 and also contrary to Administrative Order No. 6 dated September 19, 2017 were paid, thus the validity of the disbursements amounting to ₱94,002.00 cannot be ascertained.

University Memorandum No. 15 s. 2019 provides the internal guidelines on local travels of NORSU officials and employees.  Items 5.0 and 6.0 list the guidelines as follows:



“5.4.1  The Approving Official on the Travel Order under Section 4 hereof   shall determine the mode of transportation xxx to be availed, which in all cases shall be the most economical and efficient.



6.1  Request for Travel Order must be filed with the following documents:

6.1.1  Approved Letter request indicating the destination, duration and purpose of the travel;

	6.1.2  x x x

	6.1.3  Itinerary of Travel



6.3     x x x   Request for reimbursement of travel shall not be considered if processed beyond two (2) months from the date of travel. x x x”



Administrative Order No. 6 dated September 19, 2017 directing the continued adoption of austerity measures in the government as specifically indicated under Section 1, repealing AO No. 103, s. 2004, existing laws, rules and regulations mandating the judicious and prudent use of government funds shall remain in full force and effect, and all agencies and instrumentalities shall continue to ensure that no irregular, unnecessary, extravagant, excessive and unconscionable expenses shall be incurred by the government. (Emphasis ours)











In our post-audit of travelling expenses of the Mabinay campus for CY 2020, we noted that the following personnel were paid reimbursement of travel claims amounting to ₱94,002.00, as follows:

We also noted the following:

	

1)	Requests for reimbursement of travel expenses were processed even after two months from the date of travel contrary to Item 6.3 of the University Memorandum which states that “request for reimbursement of travel shall not be considered if processed beyond two (2) months from the date of travel.”

	

2)	Travels were made on consecutive days for a singular purpose each instance when these could have been scheduled properly so that many purposes could be served in one trip to make the most of the time spent in Dumaguete City and minimize expenditures pursuant to Item 3.4 of the University Memorandum



3)	Some personnel rode a public bus even if the Campus Administrator/driver used the school service vehicle in going to the same destination



4)	Unnecessary claims for bus fares amounting to ₱286.00 were incurred by persons going back to Mabinay campus on board the Main campus vehicle



5)		Claims amounting to ₱1,394.00 were not supported with complete documentation such as Travel Order and Certificate of Appearance

The guidelines on local travels of NORSU officials and employees were not followed properly because all claims for reimbursement were approved by the Campus Administrator and the Campus Accountant only relied on that approval.

	

In view of the foregoing deficiencies, the validity of the travel claims amount ₱94,002.00 cannot be ascertained and also resulted to the incurrence of unnecessary expenditures which could have been used by the campus for other valid purposes.



Recommendation:



We recommended and Management, thru the Campus Administrator, agreed to instruct all the campus officials and employees to strictly comply with the University Memorandum on travel and observe prudent use of government funds and resources as required in Administrative Order No. 6.



11)	Four (4) casual personnel of the University Cashier’s Office performing collecting functions were not officially designated and also not bonded contrary to Sections 64 and 101 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 and  Section 65, Chapter 3, Article 1 of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM), Volume 1, thus resulting to unauthorized acceptance of payments and issuance of official receipts as well as the risk of loss of government funds in the custody of persons who are not accountable officers. 

		

Section 64 of P.D. No. 1445 provides that: 



“The head of an agency may designate such number of collecting officers or agents as may be deemed necessary.  They shall render reports of their collections, under the regulations of the Commission, to be submitted promptly to the auditor concerned who shall conduct the necessary examination and audit within thirty days from receipt thereof.”

			

	

Furthermore, Section 101 (2) of the same presidential decree also requires that “every accountable officer shall be properly bonded in accordance with law.”



Finally, Sec. 65, Chapter 3, Article 1 of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM), Volume 1 states as follows:



“ x   x   x  As a general rule, the collection of revenues and receipts shall be done by the regularly appointed Collecting Officer/Treasurer.   x  x  x  Collectors/Tellers may also be designated to assist Collecting Officers/Treasurers and they shall turn over their collections daily to the Collecting Officer/Treasurer concerned. Collectors in the field shall turn over their collections on the day they return to the office.  x  x  x  “  (Underscoring ours)

	

In our verification of the collection reports for the month of January 2020, we noted that Official Receipts issued by the University Cashier’s Office for various types of collections were issued by and bore the names of the following personnel assigned at the Cashier’s Office:

 

			Name					Position



1)	Aster V. Natividad			Administrative Aide - Casual

2)	Maricor T. Cordora			Administrative Aide - Casual

3)	Johanne T. Abjelina			Administrative Aide - Casual

4)	Maria Teresa B. Avanzado		Administrative Aide - Casual



Further verification by the audit team also disclosed that they were not officially designated as collecting officers nor were they also bonded.



We interviewed Mr. Aster V. Natividad, the longest serving casual personnel of the Cashier’s Office assigned to receive collections and he explained that it was the retired Cashier (Ms. Corazon T. Saycon) who sometime in June 2005 verbally instructed him to assist her in receiving various payments made by students, employees and other stakeholders and to also issue the corresponding official receipts acknowledging the payments made.  Two other casual employees, Miss Cordora and Miss Abjelina, were also instructed to do the same in September 2012 and May 2013, respectively because Ms. Saycon could not cope up with her responsibilities as the collecting officer especially during the enrollment period considering that she was also at the same time, the disbursing officer of the Main Campus.    



 He added that upon assumption of the incumbent Acting University Cashier (Mr. Rico G. Tamparong) on May 2, 2017, they just continued with what they had been doing for the past seven years in the absence of any other instructions.  





The incumbent Acting University Cashier also explained that he continued the practice of allowing the 3 casual personnel to receive collections and issue ORs and even instructed another one, Ms. Avanzado, when he assumed office in 2017, because he cannot cope up with his workload as the Acting University Cashier doing both collecting and disbursing functions single handedly.   He added that this is the actual situation in the University Cashier’s Office because he is the only permanent employee there, thus, he is the only one who is bonded.



We reviewed the procedures practiced in the Cashier’s Office for collections and noted that the four casual personnel, upon receipt of the payments made, would issue the corresponding official receipts in their names and at the end of the day, would prepare the report of daily collections and submit the same together with the cash, ORs and supporting documents to the Acting University Cashier for review and reconciliation.  The following day, the Cashier deposits the daily collections remitted by the four casual employees together with his own collections, to the University’s authorized government depository bank.  



Although as a general rule, the collection of taxes and other revenues are done by regularly appointed collecting officers, other persons may, in the exigency of the service, be designated to assist the accountable officer.  The designation must be an official one by way of an office order approved by the head of the agency in order to establish the designee’s accountability and responsibility for the funds that he/she is permitted to collect and hold in custody.  



In this case, since the persons designated are not permanent employees, they cannot also be bonded because only permanent employees are qualified under the Philippine Bonding Law (Sections 313-338, Chapter 15, Revised Administrative Code of 1917).  Thus, the primary accountability for the funds still rests with the Acting University Cashier whose name should be the one printed on the official receipts, not the name of the casual employees, as is the prevailing practice. Those assisting him only have to counter sign or initial below his name. 



As a result of allowing casual employees to receive collections and issue ORs without officially designating them to do so, their acceptance of collections and issuance of official receipts is unauthorized and also poses a risk that government funds in their possession may not be indemnified by the Fidelity Fund in case of losses.  Moreover, the Acting University Cashier, who is still primarily responsible and accountable for the funds, may not be able to impose upon the casual employees that they strictly adhere to established procedures in recording and remittance of collections because they were not officially designated to perform collecting functions.

	  











Recommendation:



We recommended and Management, thru the University President, agreed to stop the practice of letting the casual personnel accept payments and issue official receipts.  We also recommended that an additional permanent employee or employees be appointed in the University Cashier’s Office so that another accountable officer who can be bonded, may be assigned to assist the Acting University Cashier in the efficient discharge of the functions of his office.



Management Comment:



The University President, after receipt of our Audit Observation Memorandum immediately issued an Office Order dated December 23, 2020 designating the four (4) personnel as collecting officers on an ad interim capacity subject to the approval of the Board of Regents.



Auditor’s Rejoinder:



While we appreciate the immediate action made by the University President in designating the four (4) personnel as Collecting Officers, as of report date, they are not yet bonded in accordance with law.  We suggest that the University Cashier inquire from the Bureau of Treasury (BTr) regarding the bonding requirements of the designated collecting officers and  immediately recommend to the University President for their replacement qualified personnel who can be bonded also.





A)	COMPLIANCE WITH TAX LAWS



The University complied with withholding tax laws and amounts withheld were remitted promptly to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).





B)	COMPLIANCE WITH R.A. 8291

Premiums accruing to the GSIS, HDMF and PHILHEALTH were remitted in accordance with pertinent regulations except that the unremitted amount of P1,122,607.31 pertaining to prior years are still on-going verification by the Accounting Office.
