	Scope of Audit	



The Audit Team conducted Financial and Compliance Audit on the accounts and operations of the College for CY 2020. It included analysis of accounts in the financial statements, review of transactions and test of compliance with financial rules and regulations and evaluation of the policies, processes and internal control. The objectives of the audit are to ascertain the fairness and reliability of the College’s financial position and financial performance, to determine whether its operations were conducted in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and to assess/measure the level of internal control on the policies and processes of the College.



Audit Opinion on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of MSC for CY 2020 as the accuracy and reliability of the Land account totalling ₱22,695,395.00 is doubtful due to non-recording of eight parcels of land acquired by the College through donation. Also, the recorded parcels of land as well as the seven out of the eight unrecorded parcels were not yet covered with Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) in the name of the College, contrary to Section 39 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Section 6, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I thus, resulting in the misstatement of the account in the financial statements and exposing these lots to possible third-party claims.



Audit Observations and Recommendations



	For the exceptions cited above, we recommended that Management: (a) instruct the College Accountant to cause the immediate recording of the parcels of land in the books of accounts taking into consideration the respective fair values at the time of acquisition; and (b) require the Chief Administrative Officer to prioritize the registration and transfer of land title in the name of the College to establish ownership of the properties and prevent the risk of third-party claims.



	In addition, the following are the other significant audit observations and recommendations in the audit of the College for the year 2020: 



	1)	Properties totaling ₱330,349,079.59 were not insured with the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) contrary to Section 5 of Republic Act No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law thereby, depriving the government from adequate and reliable protection against any damage or loss brought about by fortuitous events/casualty. Moreover, the Property Inventory Form (PIF) which serves as a basis in the assessment of general insurance coverage over all insurable assets, properties and interests of the government with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the GSIS was not submitted contrary to COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018.



	We recommended that Management a) require the Chief Administrative Officer to ensure that all insurable properties of the College are properly insured in compliance with RA No. 656; b) direct the Budget Officer to include in the annual budget the cost of premiums required for the insurance coverage of properties; and c) instruct the Head of the Inventory Committee to prepare and submit to GSIS and Audit Team all the identified insurable properties owned by the College by properly filling up the Property Inventory Form (PIF) following the guidelines set under COA Circular 2018-002.

	

	2)	Payments of honoraria to a) Bids and Awards Committee in the procurement of goods through Negotiated Procurement-Small Value Procurement (NP-SVP) and Direct Contracting amounting to₱29,230.00; b) BAC Secretariat in performing regular procurement activities amounting ₱13,299.40 (net of tax); and c) BAC non-member amounting to₱10,491.52 were contrary to Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Budget Circular No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005, while honoraria totaling ₱1,535,527.09 were paid to officials assigned in special projects prior to the completion and acceptance by the agency head of project deliverables contrary to Section 4.5 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 dated October 1, 2007. Out of said amount, ₱389,812.09 was paid to eight officials who rendered works inherent to their position, contrary to Section 53 (e) of the aforementioned DBM Budget Circular thus, resulting in the incurrence of irregular expenditures as defined under COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012.



	We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to (a) strictly observe the provisions of DBM Budget Circular Nos. 2004-5A and 2007-2 in granting honoraria to officials/employees involved in government procurement and assigned to special projects; (b) stop the payment of honoraria to College officials whose works/participation in the special projects are inherent to their regular duties and responsibilities and cause the refund of irregular payments; and (c) ensure that payment of honoraria shall be made only upon completion and acceptance by the agency head of the deliverables per project component.



	3)	Claims amounting to ₱107,807,473.70 including the payment/granting of various cash advances totaling ₱580,110.69 were paid despite the absence of complete supporting documents and/or do not bear the approval of the proper official contrary to Section 4 of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, thereby casting doubt on the legality/regularity, validity and propriety of the disbursements.



We recommended that Management direct the College Accountant to (a) submit the missing documentary requirements in conformity with COA Circular No. 2012-001 and related laws, rules and regulations to support the propriety and validity of the College’s expenditure; and (b) ensure that all disbursements are supported with complete documents before payments are made and refrain from processing transactions without proper approval.



	4)	Audit disallowances that became final and executory amounting to ₱512,024.41 remained unsettled despite the lapse of seven to 11 years contrary to Section 7.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 thus, deprived the government of the use of the funds for other public purposes. Moreover, the Receivables-Disallowances and Charges account amounting to ₱1,456,079.41 is not reliable due to a noted discrepancy of ₱944,055.00 thus, affecting the fair presentation of the said account in the Statement of Financial Position.

	

	We recommended that Management require the Accountant to a) cause all the liable and certifying approving officers, who took part in the disbursement of the disallowed expenditures, to assume responsibility in the final settlement of the remaining balance of the disallowance; b) impose the full settlement of disallowance that became final and executory by all persons determined to be liable; c) request approval from the Commission Proper to pay on instalment basis those who opt to avail staggered payment of disallowances; and prepare the necessary adjusting entries to reflect the correct balance of the account Receivables-Disallowances/Charges.

	

The above audit observations and recommendations were communicated with concerned management officials and staff in an exit conference conducted on March 30, 2021. Management comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate.
