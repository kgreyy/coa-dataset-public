PART II – DETAILED OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)		FINANCIAL AND COMPLIANCE AUDIT



	1)	The accuracy and reliability of the Land account totalling ₱22,695,395.00 is doubtful due to non-recording of eight parcels of land acquired by the College through donation. Also, the recorded parcels of land as well as the seven out of the eight unrecorded parcels were not yet covered with Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) in the name of the College, contrary to Section 39 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Section 6, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I thus, resulting in the misstatement of the account in the financial statements and exposing these lots to possible third-party claims.



		Section 39 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that “In the case of deeds to property purchased by any government agency, the Commission shall require a certificate of title entered in favor of the government or other evidence satisfactory to it that the title is in the government. It shall be the duty of the officials or employees concerned, xxx, to comply promptly with these requirements.  xxx”



	Section 6, Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume 1, provides that “one of the qualitative characteristics of financial reporting is reliability, defined as free from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to represent”.     

As of December 31, 2020, the Land account under Property, Plant and Equipment showed a balance of ₱22,695,395.00. Based on the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE), it comprises 11 parcels of lot with a total land area of 956,147 square meters.



Examination of records, however, revealed that there are eight other parcels of land acquired through donation that were not yet recognized in the books of the College, contrary to Section 12, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, which provides that “Cost of PPE through donation without condition shall be taken up at its fair value at the date it is acquired”



Further review of available records also showed that the said 11 recorded parcels of land as well as seven out of the eight unrecorded parcels of land have no Torrens Title yet issued under the name of the College, in violation of the above cited Section 39 of PD No. 1445, as presented in the table next page.

According to the staff of the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), the titling of lands is still in-process. On the other hand, the Accountant explained that she was not able to record the eight parcels of land since relevant documents were only furnished to her recently and that there were still unresolved issues and third-party claims on the donated lands located at Torrijos and Gasan. 



		The land title is the evidence of the right of the owner or extent of his interest where he can maintain control and right to exclusive possession and enjoyment of the property. Thus, failure to secure titles for all the lands owned by the College exposed them to the risk of disputes or claims by third/other parties. 

	

	The foregoing deficiencies rendered the Land account in the financial statement unreliable and/or misstated.



We recommended that Management:



a)	instruct the College Accountant to cause the immediate recording of the parcels of land in the books of accounts taking into consideration the respective fair values at the time of acquisition; and



b)	require the Chief Administrative Officer to prioritize the registration and transfer of land title in the name of the College to establish ownership of the properties and prevent the risk of third-party claims.



The Chief Administrative Officer commented that the processing of documents for the titling of lands are still ongoing and that the College is consistently coordinating with the concerned land owners/donors in order to facilitate/expedite the transfer of ownership of the lands in its name.



	2)	Delayed/non-submission of two (2) infrastructure contracts and 232 Purchase Orders (POs) together with all supporting documents in the total amount of ₱21,114,309.94 and ₱32,477,412.35, respectively, contravenes Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 precluding the Audit Team to conduct timely review/evaluation on the reasonableness of contract cost and promptly communicate to management any deficiencies on the contracts/POs.



			Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 provide that:

	

Section 3.1.1-within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or its instrumentalities, including government owned and controlled corporations and their subsidies, a copy of the said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.



Section 3.2.1 –a copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and every supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned within the same period, the Auditor shall review and point out to management defects and/or deficiencies, if any xxx.



Records revealed that contracts together with bidding and other technical documents of two infrastructure projects totalling ₱21,114,309.94 implemented by the College in CY 2020 were not submitted to the Audit Team within five (5) working days upon execution and issuance thereof as prescribed under Sections 3.1.1 COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, as follows:

Copies of the perfected contracts of the above projects were attached as supporting documents of the disbursement vouchers covering the first billing payment of the projects that were submitted to the AT.



Also, copies of 232 POs with aggregate amount of ₱32,477,412.35 were submitted on quarterly basis with delays ranging from 1 to 157 days, contrary to Section 3.2.1 of the same COA Circular. A summary of the delays in the submission of copies of POs are presented in Annex A. 



The Supply and Property Management Office staff clarified that the quarterly submission of POs to the Office of the Auditor was based on the Quality Manual and Quality Procedures prepared by the previous Supply Officer. 



The delayed/non-submission of the perfected contracts and purchase orders hampers the timely review/evaluation of the reasonableness of the contract cost and defects/deficiencies on the contracts/POs, if any, could not be communicated promptly to Management for appropriate action/remedies.



We recommended that Management require the BAC Secretariat and the Supply Officer to submit copies of contracts and POs together with the supporting documents, within five (5) working days from perfection/issuance thereof pursuant to COA Circular No. 2009-001, for prompt review/evaluation by the Auditor so that deficiencies, if any, could be immediately communicated for appropriate action.



The BAC Secretariat and Supply Officer committed to comply with the submission of contracts/POs and its supporting documents to the Audit Team within the prescribed period. Moreover, the Supply Officer commented that their office has already revised the period of submission of POs indicated in their Quality Manual and Quality Procedures.



	3)	Delayed submission of financial reports and related supporting documents to the Auditor ranging from 1 to 157 days contrary to Section 7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 and Section 60, Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs Volume I, thus, precluded the timely audit of accounts and financial transactions, and/or detection and correction of errors/deficiencies that may be noted in audit, if any. Moreover, the Budget Officer does not submit Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs) as required under Section 4.3 of COA-DBM Joint Circular 2019-1 dated January 1, 2019.



Section 7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 which provides the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) prescribed the following responsibilities, among others:



The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized officials performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that:



a)		the reports and supporting documents submitted by the accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month;

	xxx

		Review of records revealed that in CY 2020, the Budget Officer did not submit to the Audit Team the required Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs), contrary to Section 4.3 of COA-DBM Joint Circular 2019-1.

	

		Inquiry with the Accountant and the Budget Officer disclosed that delays and/or non-submission of the required financial statement/reports were attributed to the voluminous transactions which are meticulously checked for completeness of supporting documents prior to submission to the Audit Team to avoid audit suspensions and disallowances. 



Delayed and non-submission of the financial reports including the related supporting documents hampers the Audit Team to perform timely audit of accounts and financial transactions of the agency thus, any errors/deficiency could not be immediately relayed to Management for correction.  



	We recommended that the College President:



a)	instruct the Accountant to (i) strictly observe the deadline set for the submission of reports pursuant to pertinent provisions of COA Circular No. 2009-006 and Volume I of GAM for NGAs to enable the Audit Team to render a more timely audit of financial transactions; and (ii) submit a complete set of quarterly financial statements for each fund cluster; 



b)	direct the Budget Officer to immediately submit the Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs) to the Audit Team and strictly adhere to the provision of COA-DBM Joint Circular 2019-1 pertinent to the submission of the said reports; and



c)	cause the automatic suspension of payment of salaries of the Accountant, Budget Officer and/or other concerned official/s until the required reports and supporting documents/schedules are promptly submitted pursuant to Section 122 of P. D. No. 1445.   



	The concerned officials assured compliance with the audit recommendations in the ensuing year.



	4)	The Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption, Monthly Report of Official Travels and Driver’s Trip Tickets were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor for verification contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 77-61 dated September 26, 1977 thus, casted doubts on the reasonableness of fuel consumption in CY 2020 totalling ₱284,796.92. 



	COA Circular No. 77-61 dated September 26, 1977 prescribes the use of the Manual on Audit of Fuel Consumption of Government Vehicles in order to minimize wasteful, excessive and unnecessary expenditures for fuel consumption in line with the government’s concern and efforts to ensure the effective conservation of energy and proper utilization of government motor transportation. 



		Specific rules and regulations of the said Circular provides for the following:



		The use of government vehicles shall be properly controlled and 	regulated through properly accomplished and duly approved Driver’s 	Trip Tickets which should be serially numbered, a summary of which 	shall be made at the end of the month in a Monthly Report of Official 	Travels. 

		

		No disbursement voucher for fuel consumption (gasoline and oil) of government vehicles shall be allowed in audit unless duly supported by properly accomplished and approved serially numbered driver’s trip tickets xxx.

	

		Fuel consumption of government motor transportation shall be 	properly controlled and accounted for through approved Requisition 	and Issue Voucher or equivalent. 

		

	Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption of government motor transportation shall be submitted to the Auditor for verification purposes to determine the reasonableness of fuel consumed during the period. In the determination of the quantity of gasoline required for each motor vehicle for each trip, all personnel concerned shall be guided by the average minimum and maximum gasoline and oil consumption of different types of motor vehicles. xxx

	

Review of the financial statements disclosed that the College had incurred a total amount of ₱284,796.92 for fuel, oil and lubricants expenses in CY 2020. Audit of fuel consumption and review of records disclosed that the agency failed to submit to the Audit Team the Driver’s Trip Tickets, Monthly Report of Official Travels and Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption contrary to the above said COA Circular No. 77-61.



Inquiry with the staff of the Administrative Office disclosed that copies of the said reports are regularly submitted to the Supply and Property Management Office (SPMO). She also explained that she was not aware that said reports should also be transmitted to the Office of the Auditor. 



Properly accomplished driver’s trip tickets, Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption and Monthly Report of Official Travels are among the safeguards used when processing expenditures for payment of fuel, oil and lubricants expenses to provide adequate controls and monitoring of purchases and consumption of fuel. Non-submission of the aforementioned reports precluded the audit team to determine the reasonableness of the fuel consumption during the year.



We recommended that Management instruct the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) to regularly submit to the Audit Team the Monthly Report of Official Travel and Monthly Report of Fuel Consumption including its supporting documents pursuant to COA Circular No. 77-61 for the proper determination of the reasonableness and validity of the College’s fuel consumption. 



The Chief Administrative Officer assured that the required reports will be regularly submitted to the Office of the Auditor.



	5)	Properties totalling ₱330,349,079.59 were not insured with the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) contrary to Section 5 of Republic Act No. 656, otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law thereby, depriving the government from adequate and reliable protection against any damage or loss brought about by fortuitous events/casualty. Moreover, the Property Inventory Form (PIF) which serves as a basis in the assessment of general insurance coverage over all insurable assets, properties and interests of the government with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the GSIS was not submitted contrary to COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018.



Section 5 of Republic Act (RA) No. 656, otherwise known as Property Insurance Law as amended by Presidential Decree (PD) No. 245 provides that:



	Every government, except a municipal government below first class, is hereby required to insure its properties, with the Fund against any insurable risk herein provided and pay the premiums thereon, which, however, shall not exceed the premiums charged by private insurance companies: Provided, however, That the System reserves the right to disapprove the whole or a portion of the amount of insurance applied for: Provided, further, That such property or part thereof as may not be insurable or acceptable for insurance may be insured with any private insurance company. A municipal government below first class may upon application insure its properties in the Fund under such rules and regulations as the System may prescribe.



On the other hand, Section 5.1 of Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 provided for the following guidelines in the submission of the Property Inventory Form:



Section 5.1 Heads of government agencies shall direct the pertinent official under his/her supervision to:



a)	Secure directly from the GSIS GIF, all insurances of bonds, covering properties, contract, rights of action and other insurable risks of their respective offices;

b)	Prepare the Property Inventory Form (PIF) listing all the insurable properties and other assets, showing their latest appraised values/valuation appraisal date, location and other information;

c)	Extract from the Report on Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment, as well as from the Report of Physical Count of Inventories, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Government Accounting Manual, the data for PIF pertaining to the insurable assets and interest of the government (excluding impaired properties for disposal)

d)	Cause the appraisal of the insurable properties and other assets of their respective offices. For this purpose, an in-house appraisal shall be sufficient if the property or insurable interest has a value of ₱10 million and below. Otherwise, an independent appraisal shall be necessary;

e)	Submit the consolidated PIF to the Supervising Auditor/Audit Team Leader the GIF, GSIS, not later than April 30 of each year.

	xxx

	

		            Verification of records disclosed that key properties of the College amounting to ₱330,349,079.59 which comprises buildings and structures, infrastructure assets, various machineries and equipment, furniture and fixtures were not insured with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the GSIS in CY 2020, summarized as follows:

Total

₱    330,349,079.59



Records showed that insured properties are mainly composed of motor vehicles and some buildings situated in MSC Boac Campus.



Records also disclosed that the Management did not prepare and submit the Property Inventory Form (PIF) showing their latest appraised values/valuation, appraisal date, location and other information to the Audit Team Leader and GIF, GSIS as required under Section 5.1 of Commission on Audit Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018. 



According to the liaison officer, motor vehicles were prioritized to be insured as it is a pre-requisite to vehicles registration with the Land Transportation Office. The Budget Officer also added that other properties were not yet insured due to limited funds provided to the College. 



Over the years, additional buildings were constructed and equipment were acquired by the College. As we are in a disaster-prone country due to its topography, natural catastrophes cannot be evaded and is an inherent risk in the country. Thus, it is imperative that the government’s assets are insured pursuant to RA No. 656. The responsibility towards the achievement of this objective lies within the Head of the College. Non-compliance thereof exposes the government to greater loss as it cannot be indemnified of any damage in case calamity/ies occurred. It also deprives the GSIS of the substantial premium that should have formed part of the GIF.







		We recommended that Management:



a)		require the Chief Administrative Officer to ensure that all insurable properties of the College are properly insured in compliance with RA No. 656;

	

b)		direct the Budget Officer to include in the annual budget the cost of premiums required for the insurance coverage of properties; and

	

c)		instruct the Head of the Inventory Committee to prepare and submit to GSIS and Audit Team all the identified insurable properties owned by the College by properly filling up the Property Inventory Form (PIF) following the guidelines set under COA Circular 2018-002.

	

		The Management assured the Audit Team of compliance with the above audit recommendations.



	6)	Transportation Allowance (TA) totaling ₱55,717.00 was granted to MSC Officials who were assigned with government vehicles, in violation of Section 5.2.3 ofDBM NBC No. 548 dated May 15, 2013 and Representation and Transportation Allowance amounting to ₱17,423.48 were paid without the approval of proper official contrary to Section 4 (5) of P.D No. 1445.



	Section 5.2.3 of DBM NBC No. 548 dated May 15, 2013 provides that TA shall not be granted to officials/employees who are assigned or presently use government motor transportation.

	

	Review of the Report of Inventory of Vehicles and Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) disclosed that the former Acting Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) and the current CAO were assigned the following government vehicles:

	MSC Official

	Government Vehicle Assigned

	Period of Assignment

	Acting CAO

1)		Mitsubishi Adventure Sport

2)		Passenger Jeepney, 21seater capacity

3)		Toyota Corona

4)		2016 Mahindra Enforcer Single Cab Drop Side Pick Up 4x2

5)		Kawasaki Motorcycle

6)		Mitsubishi Xpander GLX Plus

	January to August 2020

	

	CAO

	

	September to December 2020



	

	Audit also disclosed that the former Acting CAO and the incumbent CAO were both paid Transportation Allowance in the amount of ₱35,717.00 and ₱20,000.00, respectively, in CY 2020. 

	

	Payment of transportation allowance to those officials who were assigned with government vehicles is contrary to Section 5.2.3 of DBM NBC No. 548 dated May 15, 2013 thereby rendering the transactions irregular.

	

Section 3.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 defines irregular expenditure as an expenditure incurred without adhering to established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have gained recognition in laws. Irregular expenditures are incurred if funds are disbursed without conforming with prescribed usages and rules of discipline. There is no observance of an established pattern, course, mode of action, behavior, or conduct in the incurrence of an irregular expenditure. A transaction conducted in a manner that deviates or departs from, or which does not comply with standards set is deemed irregular. A transaction which fails to follow or violates appropriates rules of procedure is, likewise, irregular.

	

	The Accountant justified that although these officials were assigned with government vehicles, they do not actually use the vehicles since they use their personal vehicles. The Supply Officer added that MSC vehicles were assigned to the Administrative Officer as the approving officer of the Service Vehicle Request Form. 

	

	The provisions of Section 5.2.3 of DBM NBC No. 548 dated May 15, 2013 clearly states that TA should not be granted to officials/employees who are assigned with government vehicle.  

	

	Review of transactions also disclosed that Box C of three (3) disbursement vouchers (DV) for payment of RATA totaling ₱17,423.48 were not signed by the College President to signify approval of the transactions, contrary to Section 4 (5) of PD No.1445which provides that disbursements or disposition of government funds or property shall invariably bear the approval of the proper officials.



	It was also observed that the Budget Officer (BO) signed Box B of the DV although there was no office memorandum/order designating him as the authorized representative of the Head of the Accounting Unit on the following payments, contrary to Section 12, Chapter 6, GAM for NGAs, Volume I:

	We recommended that Management:



a)	instruct the Supply Officer to assign the MSC vehicles to the head of the motorpool or to the concerned officials who are actually using said vehicles; and



b)	require the College Accountant to ensure that all disbursements invariably bear the approval of proper officials as stated in Section 4 (5) of PD No. 1445.



			The Chief Administrative Officer informed that motor vehicles were already 	assigned to the concerned officials who are actually using the MSC vehicles and submitted a certification that officials assigned with government vehicles did not actually use the same.



	7)	The grant of ₱100.00 daily Subsistence Allowance to the College Nurse exceeded the allowable rate of ₱50.00 per day contrary to Section 8.3 Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and Department of Health (DOH) Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2012 dated November 29, 2012 thus, resulting in overpayment of ₱11,700.00.



Section 8.3 of Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and Department of Health (DOH) Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2012 dated November 29, 2012 provides that Subsistence Allowance shall be ₱50 for each day of actual full-time service, or ₱25 for each day of actual part-time service.

Verification of disbursement vouchers disclosed that the College Nurse was granted Subsistence Allowance of ₱100 per day instead of the allowed ₱50 for each day of actual full-time service thus, resulting in the overpayment ₱11,700.00, computed as follows:

 The Accountant explained that ₱100 per day was the usual rate used in the payment of the said allowance. Also, according to the College Nurse they have already inquired from the Department of Health on the reasonableness of the rate used in the payment of subsistence allowance. However, no letter reply has been received as of to date.



The grant of Subsistence Allowance should only be based on allowed rate per day under DBM and DOH Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2012, pending the approval of the requested increase. 



	We recommended that Management instruct the Accountant to strictly adhere with the guidelines provided under DBM-DOH Joint Circular No. 1, s 2012, dated November 29, 2012 in granting Subsistence Allowance; and direct the Accountant to require the College Nurse to immediately refund the excess amount of ₱11,700.00.



	The Accountant informed the Audit Team that as of March 30,2021 the College Nurse had already refunded an amount of ₱2,000.00. She ensured that copies of official receipts will be furnished to the Office of the Auditor after full payment.



	8)	Payments of honoraria to a) Bids and Awards Committee in the procurement of goods through Negotiated Procurement-Small Value Procurement (NP-SVP) and Direct Contracting amounting to ₱29,230.00; b) BAC Secretariat in performing regular procurement activities amounting ₱13,299.40 (net of tax); and c) BAC non-member amounting to ₱10,491.52 were contrary to Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Budget Circular No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005, while honoraria totalling ₱1,535,527.09 were paid to officials assigned in special projects prior to the completion and acceptance by the agency head of project deliverables contrary to Section 4.5 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 dated October 1, 2007. Out of said amount, ₱389,812.09 was paid to eight officials who rendered works inherent to their position, contrary to Section 53 (e) of the aforementioned DBM Budget Circular thus, resulting in the incurrence of irregular expenditures as defined under COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012.



Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Circular No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005 provides for the guidelines on the Grant of Honoraria to Government Personnel involved in Government Procurement which defines honoraria as follows:



	Honorarium/ia is a form of compensation granted to individuals for the performance of tasks or involvement in activities beyond their regular functions. Equity calls for equal compensation for performance of substantially similar duties, with substantially similar degrees of responsibility. Propriety dictates that only persons who have successfully completed their tasks or participated in accomplished activities ought to be accomplished.



				Section 5.2 of the said Budget Circular requires that:



			The payment of honoraria shall be limited to procurement that involves 	bidding. Competitive bidding activities are present only in:

	

--		Open and competitive;

--		Limited source bidding;

--		Negotiated procurement under Section 53 (a) of the IRR-A, where 	there has been failure of bidding for the second time; and

--		Negotiated procurement under Section 53 (b) of the IRR-A 	following the procedures under Section 54.2 (b) thereof, 	whereby the procuring entity shall draw up a list of at least (3) 	suppliers or contractors which will be invited to submit bids.

			

		Conversely, honoraria will not be paid when procurement is thru:

	

--		Direct contracting;

--		Repeat order;

--		Shopping;

--			Negotiated procurement under Section 53 (b) of the IRR-A following the procedures under Section 54.2 (d) thereof, whereby the procuring entity directly negotiates with previous supplier, contractor or consultant, or when the project is undertaken by administration or thru the AFP, in case of infrastructure projects; and

--			Negotiated procurement under Section 53 (c) to (g) of the IRR-A.



Moreover, Section 5.5 of the same DBM Budget Circular states that to be entitled 	to honoraria, personnel should be duly assigned as chairman or member of the BAC or 	the TWG by the head of the department/agency concerned.



		Further, Section 5.6 of the same DBM Budget Circular also provides that:



The members of the BAC Secretariat who are performing the attendant functions in additions to their regular duties in other non-procurement units of the agency may likewise be paid honoraria at the same rate as the TWG Chair and Members, subject to the same regulations.



	The members of the BAC Secretariat whose positions are in the Procurement Unit of the agency shall not be entitled to honoraria. The payment of overtime services may be allowed, subject to existing policy on the matter.



--	Honoraria paid to BAC totalling ₱29,230.00 (net of tax) in the procurement of goods through Negotiated Procurement-Small Value Procurement (NP-SVP) and Direct Contracting. 



Audit of disbursement vouchers disclosed that during the year, the College paid honoraria to its Bids and Awards Committee totaling ₱158,497.20 through the grant of cash advances to the duly designated disbursing officer. 

Verification of payroll and supporting documents attached to the liquidation report/documents of the above cash advances disclosed that Payroll No. 720-07-0291 dated July 24, 2020 with net amount of ₱29,230.00 represents honoraria paid to members of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) in the procurement of 12 projects wherein ten were made through Negotiated Procurement-Small Value Procurement (NP-SVP) while two projects were procured through  Direct Contracting, contrary to Section 5.2  of DBM Budget Circular which clearly stated that payment of honoraria to BAC shall be limited to procurement that involves competitive bidding and shall not be allowed when the mode of procurement is thru NP-SVP and Direct Contracting.  Thus, the said payment can be considered irregular as defined under COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012. 



--	Honoraria paid to BAC Secretariat member in performing regular procurement activities amounting ₱13,299.40 (net of tax)



Moreover, audit revealed that a member of the BAC Secretariat was paid honoraria totalling ₱13,299.40 (net of tax) during the year in performing regular procurement activities in the Procurement Unit such as posting to PhilGEPS, preparing procurement resolutions as well as assisting in the canvass of prices and in the procurement process of the needed commodities, contrary to Section 5.6 of DBM Budget Circular No.2004-5A. 

		

The staff in the Procurement Unit admitted the non-entitlement to receive honoraria.  However, in consideration of the voluminous works in the Procurement Unit, the Internal Audit allowed the claim.



--	Honoraria paid to BAC non-member amounting to ₱10,491.52



Review of records also revealed that Engr. Malabana was assigned to assist a provisional BAC member and was paid honoraria amounting to ₱10,491.52 (net of tax) during the year although he is not included in the Office Memorandum designating/creating the BAC Composition.



The staff in the Procurement Unit explained that Engr. Malabana was not expressly identified in the Office Memorandum since he was only assigned by the provisional member for civil works in the BAC as her assistant. 



The College Secretary, on the other hand, also commented that Engr. Malabana was paid honoraria as one of the provisional members of the BAC as end-user for civil works. She explained that end-user was not identified anymore in the Office Memorandum designating the BAC Members. 



Item 5.5 of Budget Circular No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005 specifically states that to be entitled to honoraria, personnel should be duly assigned as chair or member of the BAC or the TWG by the head of the agency concerned.

--	Honoraria paid to officials assigned in special projects prior to project completion totaling ₱1,535,527.09

	

Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Budget Circular No. 2007-2 dated October 1, 2007 prescribes the guidelines on the grant of honoraria due to assignment in government special projects. Section 2.1 of the said Budget Circular defines honorarium as a form of compensation given as a token of appreciation or reward for gratuitous services on account of one’s broad and superior knowledge or expertise in a specific field for which, going by custom, tradition or propriety, no fixed price is set.

	

	Moreover, Section 53 (e) of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465, the FY 2020 General Appropriations Act (GAA) provides that:

		

Section 53. Honoraria. Honoraria may be paid only to following:	

			   xxx

		e) Officials and employees assigned to special projects, subject to the following conditions:

		xxx

	(ii) Such assignment entails rendition of work in addition to, or over and above, their regular workload.

	

				On the other hand, Item 4.5 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 dated October 1, 2007 provides that payment of the honorarium shall be made only upon completion and acceptance by the agency head of the deliverable per project component.

		

				Post-audit of transactions disclosed that during the year, honoraria totaling ₱1,535,527.09 (net of tax) was paid to various College employees/officials assigned in various special projects prior to the completion and acceptance by the agency head of the 	project deliverables.



Review of the available supporting documents attached to payroll liquidations showed that a monthly or quarterly progress/accomplishment report of the project management team is being attached in the claims for honoraria for the partial implementation of the special projects instead of the Certificate of Completion and Certificate of Acceptance by the agency head of the deliverables per project component as required under COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. 

	

	Further, examination disclosed that out of the amount of ₱1,535,527.09 honorarium paid, ₱397,812.09 was granted to eight College officials who did not render additional work over and above their regular workload, contrary to the above provisions of DBM BC No. 2007-2 summarized in the next page.

Review of records disclosed that the designation of the above officials in the project management team for the above listed special projects constitute the performance of their regular functions which is to ensure that all the financial transactions of the project shall be properly processed, accounted and paid on time, subject to the auditing and accounting rules and prepare the financial report for submission to the recipient agency after completion of the project. Hence, honoraria should not have been granted because the concerned officials were already compensated with their monthly salaries in the performance of their regular functions.



The Accountant explained that honoraria granted were provided in the line-item budget of respective special project indirect cost for project support staff although she admitted that the participation of the respective officials on the special projects were related to their primary functions. Moreover, the Vice President for Research Development, Extension and Training justified that said compensation were given because preparation of the required reports requested by the recipient agency relative to the special project consume additional time and entails additional work on the part of the said officials. 



	The grant of honoraria without adherence to the existing rules and regulations rendered the transactions irregular as defined under COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 and exposed government funds to possible risk of misappropriation in the event of non-completion of projects.



	We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to:



a)	strictly observe the provisions of DBM Budget Circular Nos. 2004-5A and 2007-2 in granting honoraria to officials/employees involved in government procurement and assigned to special projects; 



b)	stop the payment of honoraria to College officials whose works/participation in the special projects are inherent to their regular duties and responsibilities and cause the refund of irregular payments; and 



c)	ensure that payment of honoraria shall be made only upon completion and acceptance by the agency head of the deliverables per project component.



The Management commented that an office memorandum was already issued to the concerned officials and agreed to refund the claimed honoraria except for the Chief Administrative Officer who commented that his participation which includes review of legal documents related to the program and checking the legal bases of the auditing, accounting and budgeting process applied thereto are beyond his regular function which is to formulate and implement administrative policies. 



To validate, the Audit Team required the submission of the CAO’s Position Description Form (PDF) in order to determine his regular function, but the required document was not yet submitted as of this writing. However, based on the issued office memorandum relative to his assignment in the special project CLAAP, together with the Accountant, Budget Officer, Cashier, Disbursing Officer (DO) and Assistant DO, their specific functions is to ensure that all the financial transactions of the project shall be properly processed, accounted and paid on time, subject to the auditing and accounting rules and prepare the financial report for submission to the recipient agency after completion of the project. Hence, the Audit Team stands that the CAO’s honoraria should be refunded since his assignment in the special project pertains to his regular function in the payment of College’s transactions.



	9)	Disbursements amounting to ₱553,061.18 were paid thru reimbursement basis instead of direct payment to suppliers, contrary to Section 93 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Republic Act No. 9184 thus, deprived the government of taxes that could have been withheld from the payments thereof.



				Section 93 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 also known as State Audit Code of the 	Philippines states that:

	

	To whom warrants or checks payable. Warrants chargeable to revenue or trust funds of the national government or checks drawn against the treasury Checking Account for Agencies maintained with any government depository shall be made payable either directly to the creditor to whom the money is due or to a disbursing officer for official disbursement



Pertinent provisions of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No.9184 provide as follows:



			Section 10.	All procurement shall be done through competitive 			bidding, except as provided in Article XVI of this IRR.

	

		Section 48.1 Subject to the approval of the Head of the Procuring 	Entity and whenever justified by the conditions 	provided in this Act, the Procuring Entity may, 	resort to any of the alternative methods of procurement 	provided in this rule. In all instances, the Procuring 	Entity shall ensure that the most advantageous price for 	the Government is obtained.

	

		Post-audit of transactions of the College for CY 2020 disclosed that several officials and employees were paid a total amount of ₱553,061.18 as reimbursements of procured goods/services from their own personal account in favor of the College. The details are shown in Annex C.

		

		Payment in cash to suppliers is contrary to Item 2.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 which provides that all payments must be made by checks. x x x  In practice, however, there are certain instances when it may be very difficult, impractical or impossible to make payments by check.  In such case, payments may be made by the disbursing office in the form of cash though his cash advance.  

	

		Also, reimbursements pertaining to procurements of goods and services paid in cash by the payees contravenes RA No. 9184 which prescribes the use of competitive bidding and for exceptional cases, the alternative modes of procurement in the acquisition of goods and services to ensure that the most advantageous price for the Government is obtained. 

	

		The Accountant and the concerned officials/employees explained that they resorted to reimbursements as the mode of disbursements and procurements in several transactions due to short duration provided by the grantor in project implementation and non-maintenance of petty cash fund that can be used to pay petty and emergency expenses.

	

			Payments in cash to suppliers of goods and services by those who claimed reimbursements not only violates the provision of Section 93 of P.D No. 1445 which requires direct payment to the creditor to whom the money is due or to a disbursing officer for official disbursement but also deprives the government of the possible income that can be derived from withholding of taxes from the suppliers of goods and services.

	

			We recommended and Management agreed to: 

	

a)	strictly adhere to Section 93 of PD No. 1445 and effect payment of goods and services through check payable to the supplier or dealer except in cases where needed items are extremely necessary and urgent which cannot be conveniently paid by check; and



b)	set-up and maintain a Petty Cash Fund duly supported by an estimate of expenses which shall be strictly used for petty operating expenses in accordance with COA Circular No. 97-002.

	10)	Claims amounting to ₱107,807,473.70 including the payment/granting of various cash advances totalling ₱580,110.69 were paid despite the absence of complete supporting documents and/or do not bear the approval of the proper official contrary to Section 4 of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, thereby casting doubt on the legality/regularity, validity and propriety of the disbursements.



Section 4 (6) of PD No. 1445 pertains to fundamental principles governing financial transactions and operations of any government agency which provides among others, that claims against government fund shall be supported with complete documentation.



Corollary thereto, COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 was issued to prescribe for the documentary requirements for common government transactions. As provided in the said COA Circular, one of the general requirements for all types of disbursement is sufficient and relevant documents to establish validity of claims.



Post-audit of transactions of the College for CY 2020 disclosed that disbursement vouchers covering the grants of cash advances to disbursing officers, payments of infrastructure projects, magna carta benefits of College Nurse and honoraria were not supported with complete documents required in COA Circular No. 2012-001.  Hence, validity of the claims cannot established. (Please see details of missing supporting documents in Annex D)



Moreover, review disclosed that Box B of five (5) disbursement vouchers (DV) covering the payments/granting of cash advances totaling ₱580,110.69 were signed by the Budget Officer (BO) or the Accounting Staff without proper authorization as representative of the Head of the Accounting Unit and Box C was not signed by the head of the agency for the approval of the transaction/s, contrary to Section 4 (5) of PD No.1445.

In the absence of complete supporting documents and proper approval, the propriety, validity and regularity of the claims cannot be ascertained.



We recommended that Management direct the College Accountant to:



a)	submit the missing documentary requirements in conformity with COA Circular No. 2012-001 and related laws, rules and regulations to support the propriety and validity of the College’s expenditure; and 



b)	ensure that all disbursements are supported with complete documents before payments are made and refrain from processing transactions without proper approval.



The Accountant assured the Audit Team of the submission of all the missing documentary requirements.



	11)	Audit disallowances that became final and executory amounting to ₱512,024.41 remained unsettled despite the lapse of seven to 11 years contrary to Section 7.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 thus, deprived the government of the use of the funds for other public purposes. Moreover, the Receivables-Disallowances and Charges account amounting to ₱1,456,079.41 is not reliable due to a noted discrepancy of ₱944,055.00 thus, affecting the fair presentation of the said account in the Statement of Financial Position.



Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 prescribes the use of the rules and regulations on the settlement of accounts. Section 7.1 of the said Circular provides for the responsibilities or the agency head which states that:



		7.1.1 The head of agency, who is primary responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to the agency, shall ensure that(a) the required financial and other reports and statements are submitted by the concerned agency officials in such form and within the period prescribed by the Commission; (b) the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within the prescribed period. xxx

	

		1)		He shall enforce the COA Order of Execution (COE) by requiring the withholding of salaries or other compensation due the person liable in satisfaction of disallowance and charge.

	

		1)		He shall also ensure that all employees who are retiring or transferring to other agencies shall first settle the disallowances and charges for which they are liable.

	

Records showed that audit disallowance of ₱512,024.41 that became final and executory remained unsettled for as long as 11 years despite the issuance of NFD/COE. The details of these audit disallowances are as follows:

Review of the financial statements for CY 2020 also disclosed that the reported unsettled balances under the account Receivables-Disallowances and Charges amounted to ₱1,456,079.41 and not the above balance of ₱512,024.41 thus, the discrepancy of ₱944,055.00. 



Examination of the Financial Management Services (FMS) books disclosed that the discrepancy of ₱944,055.00 was attributed to the following:

	

a)		ND No. 12-001-100 (10) in the amount of ₱1,244,300.00 was recorded twice; 

b)		erroneous adjusting entry to correct the double recording of ND No. 12-001-100 (10) of ₱1,224,300.00 instead of ₱1,244,300.00;

c)		understatement of ₱20,000.00 in recording ND No. 12-001-100 (10) for which the FMSO staff recorded only ₱1,224,300.00 instead of ₱1,244,300.00;

d)		Withholding tax amounting to ₱260,245.00 was recorded as settlement.

		

	Inquiry with the Accountant disclosed that the remaining balance of disallowance was not deducted anymore from payroll due to absence of request for instalment payment of the concerned liable persons.  She also added that other persons liable had already retired or had already been separated from the service prior to issuance of the disallowances thus collections/recovery thereof could hardly be enforced; while others willfully refuse to pay their liability. Moreover, she admitted the erroneous recording of the ND in the books and assured the Audit Team to adjust accordingly to reflect the corrected balance in the books. 

	

	The failure of management to institute the settlement of the NDs deprived the government of the use of the funds for other public purposes. Moreover, unreliability of the Receivables-Disallowances/Charges affected the fair presentation of the said account in the Statement of Financial Position. 

	

	We recommended that Management require the Accountant to:

	

			i)			cause all the liable and certifying approving officers, who took part in the disbursement of the disallowed expenditures, to assume responsibility in the final settlement of the remaining balance of the disallowance;

			ii)			impose the full settlement of disallowance that became final and executory by all persons determined to be liable; 

		

			iii)			request approval from the Commission Proper to pay on instalment basis those who opt to avail staggered payment of disallowances; and

		

			iv)			prepare the necessary adjusting entries to reflect the correct balance of the account Receivables-Disallowances/Charges.

	

	The Vice President for Administration and Finance stated that the Management will require the Chief Administrative Officer to issue a letter to those liable officers who have outstanding balance of disallowances and require them to settle their liabilities. On the other hand, the Accountant informed the Audit Team that they already made the necessary adjusting entries to correct the balance of the Receivables-Disallowances/Charges account.



A)	GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT (GAD) IMPLEMENTATION



	12)	The College failed to institutionalize Gender and Development (GAD) database containing gender statistics and sex-disaggregated data contrary to Section 36(c), Article VI of Republic Act No.9710 or the Magna Carta of Women and Section 4.4 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular 2012-01 thus, limiting the conduct of an in-depth identification of other gender issues or gaps and may affect the quality of performance-based and gender-responsive planning and budgeting for the attainment of goal in promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment.



Section 36 (c), Article VI of RA No. 9710 states that all departments including their attached agencies, offices, bureaus, state universities and colleges, government-owned and controlled corporations, local government units and other government instrumentalities shall develop and maintain a GAD database containing gender statistics and sex disaggregated data that have been systematically gathered, regularly updated and subjected to gender analysis for planning, programming and policy formulation.

	

		Moreover, Item 4 of Philippine Commission on Women (PCW)/National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA)/Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides for the essential elements in Gender and Development (GAD) Planning and Budgeting (GPB) to enable agencies for a more effective planning and implementation of their sectoral programs on GAD. It further states that should these elements are not present or need to be strengthened; agencies shall include them in their GPBs. These elements include among others the institutionalization of GAD Database/Sex-disaggregated Data under Item 4.4 which states that:



The GAD Database should be developed or integrated in its existing database on GAD information, which includes gender statistics and sex-disaggregated data that have been systematically produced or gathered as inputs or bases for planning, budgeting, programming, and policy information.

		Inquiry with GAD Support Staff disclosed that the College was not able to establish a GAD database. The failure to generate and maintain GAD database would imply that the programs, projects and activities (PPAs) identified in the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) were not properly identified since these were not supported by evidence-based data thus, gender issues reported on the GPB may not be true or actually present.

	

		The establishment of GAD database, which includes collection of sex disaggregated data and gender-related information, will help facilitate the change needed to address gender issues. The collected sex disaggregated data and gender-related information of the College personnel and clients will also help as problems and concerns that arise from unequal status of women and men including the differential characteristics, roles and expectations attributed by women and men may eventually surface. These gender-related data are necessary inputs for a comprehensive analysis to identify priority gender issues that need to be addressed. The availability and accessibility of such data are instrumental in the development and implementation of gender-responsive programs and projects.

	

	We recommended that Management require its GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) to lead in setting up appropriate systems and mechanisms to ensure the generation and processing of sex-disaggregated GAD database and undertake gender analysis to identify and confirm existing gender issues and ensure that the programs, projects and activities are responsive to the said issues.



	The GAD Focal Person commented that the GAD Unit has gender statistical data only but assured the Audit Team that their office will comply with the above audit recommendations.



	13)	Expenditures for Gender and Development (GAD) amounting to ₱6,851,158.80 were not included in the approved GPB contrary to Section 9 and 10.1 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular 2012-01 thus, affected the College’s goal to attain GAD objectives and depleted the fund for gender issues identified in its GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for the year.



		RA No. 9710, otherwise known as the “Magna Carta of Women (MCW)” was enacted to eliminate discrimination against women by recognizing, respecting, protecting, fulfilling and promoting the rights of Filipino women, especially those in the marginalized sectors. 

	

Corollary thereto, the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) and the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and the issued Joint Circular No. 2012-01 to provide guidelines for the Preparation of Annual Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Budgets and Accomplishment Reports to Implement the MCW. Section 9.0 which pertains to the implementation and monitoring of the GAD Plan and Budget states that:  



9.1Upon receipt of the letter of endorsement from PCW and or the adjusted GPB, the agency head shall issue an appropriate policy directive, copy furnished PCW, to disseminate and implement the GPBs. The directive shall mandate the agency GFPS to: a) provide technical assistance, as needed, to attached agencies, bureaus and regional offices in the implementation of the GPBs; b) monitor its implementation; c) ensure the preparation and submission of GAD ARs; and d) consolidate reports on the implementation of the GPBs. 



9.2 Agencies shall inform the PCW in writing if there are changes in the PCW-endorsed GPBs as a result of revising the GPB based on the approved GAA and or the need to implement additional PAPs relevant to current gender issues or GAD-related undertakings as needed. PCW, in turn, shall acknowledge receipt of adjusted GPB and shall inform the agencies if the GAD PAPs or activities in the adjusted GPB are acceptable.

		xxx



Moreover, Section 10.0 on the preparation and submission of GAD Accomplishment Reports provides that: 



10.1 Attached agencies, bureaus, regional offices, constituent units and all others concerned shall submit their GAD ARs to their central offices. The agency GFPS shall prepare the annual GAD AR based on the PCW-endorsed GPB or the GPB adjusted to the approved GAA following the form prescribed in Annex B. Activities completed until the end of the year may be included in the final GAD AR of agency submitted to PCW in January (underscoring supplied).

			During the year, the College had appropriated ₱8,603,159.30 or five percent of its total Annual Budget for Gender and Development (GAD) programs, projects and activities as required under existing laws and regulations. 

	

		Review of the GAD Accomplishment Report revealed that out of the appropriated amount for the year of ₱8,603,159.30 only ₱7,638,416.30 or 88.79% was utilized by the College for various GAD projects, programs and activities leaving the total amount of ₱964,743.00 unexpended during the year.

	

		Comparison between the GAD Accomplishment Report and the GAD Plan and Budget for CY 2020 disclosed that out of the total reported expenditures of ₱7,638,416.30, the total amount of ₱6,851,158.80 or 89.69% was spent for payment of salaries and bonuses of the GAD Focal Person and 14 GAD Coordinators as well as construction of restrooms and ramp in TLE building amounting to ₱927,696.80 and ₱5,923,462.00, respectively, which were not included in the GPB. The list of GAD PPAs included in the approved the GPB and actual disbursements made thereon are shown in Annex E.

			The College was able to implement only four out of 36 GAD PPAs identified in the GPB amounting to ₱787,257.50 thereby falling short in the attainment of addressing gender-related issues and concerns. It was also noted that actual expenditures for three GAD PPAs implemented exceeded the budgeted amount by ₱77,091.40 which demonstrated deficiencies in budgeting. 

	

Confirmation with the GAD Support Staff disclosed that no adjusted GAD Plan and Budget was submitted to PCW for the changes/additional implementation of PAPs relevant to GAD undertakings pursuant to Section 9.2 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular 2012-01. Moreover, the utilization of the GAD fund for expenditures not included in the approved GPB affected the attainment of GAD objectives and deprived the intended beneficiaries of the benefits that may be derived in the implementation of the identified GAD PPAs.



We recommended that Management instruct the GAD Focal Person to ensure that all programs, plans and activities are properly planned and that implementation thereof be in accordance with the approved GAD Plan and Budget to optimize the use of allocated funds, and that all identified gender issues are duly addressed.



		The GAD Focal Person assured the Audit Team that all GAD PPAs will be 	incorporated in the GAD Plan and Budget.



B)	COMPLIANCE WITH TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS



	14)	Taxes were not withheld from payments to four  telecommunication service providers totalling ₱580,081.67 contrary to the existing rules and regulations of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR)  thus, deprived the government with additional revenues that could have been derived from the taxes due therefrom and caused the College primarily liable for the incurrence of unnecessary interests, penalties and/or criminal liabilities for the remiss of their obligation as withholding agent that may be imposed by the BIR for non-compliance with its regulations.

	

Under pertinent provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), all government agencies are required to withhold the required taxes from the parties with whom it transacts. 



Section 251 of the NIRC further provides that “Any person required to withhold, account for, and remit any tax imposed by this Code or who willfully fails to withhold such tax, or account for and remit such tax, or aids or abets in any manner to evade any such tax or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided for under this Chapter, be liable upon conviction to a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax not withheld, or not accounted for and remitted.”



Section 22 of Revenue Regulation (RR) No. 4-2007 dated February 7, 2007 amending certain provisions of RR No. 16-2005, provides the following, among others: 



	Section 4.114-2 of RR No. 16-2005 is hereby amended to read as follows:



	Withholding of VAT on Government Money Payments and Payments to Non-Residents. 

	

	(a) The government or any of its political subdivisions, instrumentalities or agencies including government-owned or controlled corporations (GOCCs) shall, before making payment on account of each purchase of goods and/or of services taxed at twelve percent (12%) VAT pursuant to Sections 106 and 108 of the Tax Code, deduct and withhold a final VAT due at the rate of five percent (5%) of the gross payment thereof. 

	xxx 



Section 2(J) of RR No. 11-2018 dated January 31, 2018 amending certain provisions of RR No. 2-98, to implement further amendments introduced by Republic Act No. 10963, otherwise known as the “Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN)” Law, relative to withholding of Income Tax which provides that: 



Income Payments made by a government office, national or local, including barangays, or their attached agencies or bodies, and government-owned or controlled corporations to its local/resident supplier of goods/services, other 	than those covered by other rates of withholding tax. [formerly under letter (N)] – Income payments, except any single purchase which is P10,000.00 	and below, which are made by a government office, national or local, including barangays, or their attached agencies or bodies, and government-owned or controlled corporations, on their purchases of goods and purchases of services from local/resident suppliers: 

	

		Supplier of goods    – One percent (1%) 

		Supplier of services – Two percent (2%) 



Moreover, Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 23-2012 dated February 14, 2012 reiterates the responsibilities of the Officials and Employees of government offices for the withholding of applicable taxes on certain income payments and the imposition of penalties such as penalties, in addition to the tax and criminal liabilities for non-compliance thereof. 



Review of financial statements disclosed that for CY 2020 the College incurred ₱2,463,136.22 and ₱1,900,382.31 for internet and telephone expenses, respectively.   



Post-audit of said disbursements disclosed that the College Accountant failed to deduct the corresponding withholding tax from payments to four telecommunication providers namely Globe Telecom Inc., Smart Communications Inc., Smart Broadband, Inc. and Innove Communications Inc. which is contrary to the above-cited BIR Revenue Regulation. The computed amount of withholding taxes that should have been deducted is ₱36,255.10, as presented below.

The College Accountant admitted her failure to deduct the mandatory withholding tax before making payments to the supplier and assured the Audit Team that deductions will be made in the succeeding year.



The failure of the Accountant to withhold taxes contravened BIR Revenue Regulation No. 16-005 which requires that all payments made by the government for goods and services shall be deducted with the corresponding withholding tax on the gross payment. Consequently, it deprived the government of the additional income due from the taxes therefrom. Moreover, such practice caused the College primarily liable for the incurrence of unnecessary interests, penalties and/or criminal liabilities for the remiss of their obligation as withholding agent that may be imposed by the BIR for non-compliance with its regulations. 



We recommended that Management instruct the Accountant to strictly comply with the aforementioned BIR Revenue Regulations to ensure that all payments made by the government for goods and services were deducted and withheld the corresponding withholding tax on the gross payment and that these are remitted to BIR on or before the prescribed due dates to avoid incurrence of penalties, interest and criminal liability that may be imposed by the BIR.



The Accountant stated that withholding taxes were already deducted for the respective telecommunication providers in CY 2021 and assured that all payments made by the College to suppliers are properly withheld with taxes.



C)	COMPLIANCE WITH GSIS, Pag-IBIG, PHILHEALTH REGULATIONS



Trust collections withheld/collected accruing to the GSIS and PHILHEALTH were fully remitted in CY 2020 while the remaining year-end balances of ₱6,500.00 with Pag-IBIG was remitted in January 2021 in accordance with pertinent Pag-IBIG regulations.



D)	COMPLIANCE WITH SENIOR CITIZEN AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITY (PWD) LAW



The College has incorporated in all its plans for infrastructure projects, ramps for senior citizens and PWDs. They also added rails on staircases for all its existing buildings and designated a comfort room specifically for them. The College also established express lanes in the Cashier’s booth to give priority to all senior citizens and PWDs in compliance with existing laws and regulations.     



E)	ODA FUNDED PROJECTS



The College did not receive any Official Development Assistance (ODA) funds during the year.



F)	COMPLIANCE WITH PRIORITY DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE FUND (PDAF) AND DISBURSEMENT ACCELERATION PROGRAM (DAP) DECISION



The College has not received funds for DAP and PDAF nor had any balance of the same as of December 31, 2020.

The Statement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges (SASDC) as of December 31, 2020 showed a balance of ₱2,739,350.00 for Notice of Disallowances (NDs) issued in various years. Verification with the FMS Office of the status of these final and executory audit disallowances disclosed that a total amount of ₱2,227,325.59 was already settled through salary deduction.
