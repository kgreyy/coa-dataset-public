EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 

 

A. Introduction 

 

The Biliran Province State University (BiPSU) is composed of the BiPSU Main 
Campus in Naval, Biliran and the BiPSU Biliran Campus in Biliran, Biliran Province. 
BiPSU Main Campus was originally the Naval Institute of Technology (NIT) while the 
BiPSU Biliran Campus, is the former Biliran National Agricultural College (BNAC).  

 
Pursuant to Republic Act (RA) No. 9718, signed into law by Her Excellency Gloria 

Macapagal-Arroyo on October 14, 2009, NIT was converted to Naval State University – 
Main Campus (NSU-Main Campus) and the BNAC was integrated to NSU as NSU Biliran 
Campus.  Further, on January 3, 2019, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte signed into law RA 
No. 11170, an act amending RA No. 9718, renaming NSU to BiPSU, among others.  By 
the year 2021, BiPSU envisions to be a globally competitive state university imbued with 
positive values contributory to sustainable development and progress. 
 

The audit covered the review of accounts and operations of the BiPSU Main and 
Biliran Campuses for calendar year 2020.  The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level 
of assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; 
(b) determine the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) 
recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of 
implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.

C. Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 

 
The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

Financial Statements of BiPSU for CY 2020 due to exceptions as stated in the Independent 
Auditor’s Report and discussed in detail in Part II and Part III of this Report that the year-
end balances of the following accounts:  Cash In Bank – Local Currency, Current Account; 
Inventory; Property Plant and Equipment; Construction in Progress; Advances to 
Contractors; Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable; Repairs and Maintenance Expense; 
Accounts Payable were unreliable due to  noted deficiencies/errors which affected the fair 
presentation of the Financial Statements. 
 
 
D. Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 
 The following are the significant audit observations and recommendations which 
are discussed in detail in Part II of this Report: 
 
1. Reconciling items totaling P696,636.43 were noted in the reconciliation of the 

balances in the cashbook and in the accounting records as of cash examination date 
due to the following: a) lack of periodic reconciliation between the balances in the 
Accountable Officer’s (AO) cashbook and in the accounting records; b) unrecorded 
or erroneous recording of transactions in the books; and c) failure of the AO to 
rectify the erroneous deposits made to the other funds of the University, contrary 
to Sections 110 and 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Section 6.3 of 
COA Circular No. 97-002. 
 

We recommended that the President ensure that: 

 

a. the Accountant immediately draws the necessary adjusting accounting 
entries to correct the errors detailed in the preceding paragraphs, 1.5 

and 1.6, in order to correct balances of the affected accounts;  

 

b. the Accountable Officer to immediately transfer the amount of P7,115.00 
from FC 06-BRF (IGP) account to FC 06-BRF (GI) account;  

 

c. Henceforth,: 
  

c.1 the Head of the Accounting Unit reviews the accounting entries as 

a control mechanism, prior to affixing the signature as   

 



 

iii 
 

certified correct, to preclude accumulation of accounting errors 

and to immediately correct errors; and 

 

c.2  the Accountant and the Accountable Officer conduct a periodic 

reconciliation of their records at least quarterly prior to the 

preparation of financial reports to avoid accumulation of 

variances, pursuant to Sec. 6.3 of COA Circular No. 97-002.   

 
2. Projects totalling P146,350,104.57 procured during the year involved deficiencies 

contrary to pertinent provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184 (Government 
Procurement Reform Act) and its 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and 
Regulations (RIRR) and COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009. 

 
We recommended that the President: 

 

1) require the BAC Chairperson and the BAC Secretariat Head to submit 
an explanation for the repeated deviations in their procurement 

activities; and 

 

2) instruct the BAC to strictly comply with the procurement processes 
required by RA No. 9184 and its RIRR in line with the government’s 

commitment to promote good governance and effort to adhere to the 

principles of transparency, accountability, equity, efficiency and 

economy in procurement. 

 

3. The suspension of work and contract time extension of eight (8) infrastructure 
projects were not adequately documented, contrary to pertinent provisions of 
Annex A of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 and the Manual of Procedures for the 
Procurement of Infrastructure Projects issued by the Government Procurement 
Policy Board (GPPB). 

 

We recommended that the President:  

 

a) direct the Engineering and General Services Office: 
 

1. to efficiently monitor the implementation of all infrastructure projects; 
undertake the necessary steps when the time for completion of the 

projects is extended; and to notify defaulting contractors at any time 

during the implementation of the projects whenever there is deviation 

from the PERT/CPM, and the sanctions therein; and 

 

2. to ensure the immediate completion of the ongoing projects with the 
end-goal of maximizing the utilization of the budgeted funds and timely 

delivery of improved facilities that would benefit the students and 

employees of the University; 

 



 

iv 
 

 
b) impose liquidated damages, if warranted, equal to at least one tenth (1/10) 

of one (1) percent of the cost of the unperformed portion of the works for 

every day of delay of the defaulting contractor. 
 
4. Various documentary requirements were not attached to the disbursement vouchers 

to support a number of payments to the contractors of the infrastructure projects 
totaling P109,043,995.28, rendering the validity and propriety of the subject 
transactions doubtful. 

 

We recommended that the President require both the Accountant and the 

Project In-Charge to submit immediately the lacking documents to the Audit 

Team, and henceforth, process all payments with complete documentation. 

 
5. Management failed to impose the 10% retention money amounting to 

P3,805,433.83 required from the progress billings due to contractors, contrary to 
Items 5.3 and 6.1 of Annex E of the RIRR of RA No. 9184. 

 

We recommended that henceforth, the President require the Accountant to 

strictly adhere to the law, rules and regulations on the deduction of the ten 

percent (10%) retention money from every progress payment. 

 

6. The University’s allocation for GAD programs in the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) 
was below the requirement of at least 5% of the total appropriations,  while the 
attribution of two major projects to the GAD budget was not subjected to gender 
analysis using the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) tool, 
contrary to the pertinent provisions of Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), 
National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) and Department of Budget 
and Management (DBM) Joint Circular No. 2012-01 and Section 31 of the General 
Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) FY 2020. 

 

We recommended that henceforth the President ensure that the Gender and 

Development (GAD) Focal Point System and other personnel concerned: 

 

1) allocate in the annual GPB at least five percent of the total appropriation 
as required; and 

 
2) attribute to GAD costs, a portion or the whole of the University’s major 

programs activities and projects using HGDG tool to identify and confirm 

that they are responsive to the University’s existing gender issues.

An item recognized as property, plant, and equipment is measured at   cost. 
 

A PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction is measured at its fair value as 
at the date of acquisition. 

 
 

 



 

17 
 

Measurement after Recognition 

 

After recognition, all property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. All other repair and maintenance 
cost are recognized as expense in surplus or deficit as incurred. 
 

Depreciation 

 

Each part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant 
in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately. 
 
The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expense unless it is 
included in the cost of another asset. 
 
Initial Recognition of Depreciation 

 
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use as when it is in the 
location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner 
intended by management. 
 
For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation is for one 
month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month.  However, 
if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, depreciation is for the 
succeeding month. 
 
Depreciation Method 

 

The straight line method of depreciation is adopted unless another method is more 
appropriate for agency operation. 
 
Estimated Useful Life 

 
The Biliran Province State University uses a residual value equivalent to at least 
five percent (5%) of the cost of the PPE.

balances in the cashbook and in the accounting records as of cash examination 

date due to the following: a) lack of periodic reconciliation between the 

balances in the Accountable Officer’s (AO) cashbook and in the accounting 

records; b) unrecorded or erroneous recording of transactions in the books; 

and c) failure of the AO to rectify the erroneous deposits made to the other 

funds of the University, contrary to Sections 110 and 111 of Presidential 

Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Section 6.3 of COA Circular No. 97-002. 
 

1.1. Sections 110 and 111 of PD No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government 
Auditing Code of the Philippines, provide: 

 

SECTION 110. Objectives of government accounting. -

concerning past operations and present conditions; (2) provide a 
basis for guidance for future operations; (3) provide for control of 
the acts of public bodies and officers in the receipt, disposition and 
utilization of funds and property; and (4) report on the financial 
position and the results of operations of government agencies for the 
information of all persons concerned. 

 
SECTION 111. Keeping of accounts. – (1) The accounts 

of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the

information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. 

 
(2) The highest standard of honesty, objectivity and 

consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to 
safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.

1.5. The reconciling items 1 to 6 in Table 3 and items 7 to 10 in Table 4 are explained 
as follows: 

 
1. Collections totaling P156,607.00 were not recorded in the agency books 
resulting in the understatement of Cash-Collecting Officer account balance by the 
same amount:

2. There is an overstatement in the recording of collections totaling P525.00 which 
has resulted in the overstatement of the accounting book balance:

5. A deposit made on February 17, 2020 for the FC 06-BRF-IGP amounting 
P30,445.00 was erroneously recorded in the books as P304,450.00, resulting in an 
overstatement in the Cash in Bank account, and understatement in the Cash-
Collecting Officer account by P274,005.00. 

 
6. Instead of depositing the total amount of P7,115.00, the cashier deposited it to 
the BRF-GI account.  These deposits were not yet adjusted as of cash examination 
date.

7. Unrecorded cash advances in January and February 2020 aggregating 
P1,763,539.77 were recorded in the books in May 2020 for P1,819,481.89, showing 
a variance/overstatement of P55,942.12. 

 

8. The payment of wages amounting to P9,800.00 to Jim C. Verunque under 
Check No. 804197 dated July 12, 2019 should have been recorded as Salaries and 
Wages but instead it was recorded as Advances for Payroll.  This error was 
corrected in March 2020, and a second entry was made in June 2020 for the same 
amount, thereby overstating the account. 

 

9. A liquidation report for the cash advance for Payroll No. 20090822 (T. 
Basilides et al.) in August 2020 amounting to P515,306.09 was recorded in the 
books for P515,306.06 only, thereby showing an understatement of P0.03. 

 

10. A refund of cash advance amounting to P260.00 supported with Official 
Receipt No. 06060294 dated June 16, 2020 (for Payroll No. 20030032, RM. Abad 
et al.) was not yet recorded in the books as of cash count date. 

 

1.6. Our verification of the Collecting Officer’s compliance with the previous cash 
examination observations and recommendations also showed an error in the 
accounting entry made.  The funds totaling P201,961.00 were erroneously 
deposited in the FC 05-IGF bank account when they should have been deposited in 
the FC 06-BRF(IGP) bank account.  The Audit Team then recommended the fund 
transfer of the same amount from FC 05-IGF to FC 06-BRF(IGP).  The details of 
the entries made by the Accountant, and the correct entries suggested by the Audit 
Team are presented below:

1.7. The erroneous entries have resulted in the understatement of the balances of the 

Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account -IGP by P201,961.00; the Cash in

Bank-Local Currency, Current Account IGF by P600.00 and the Accumulated 
Surplus (Deficit) by P201,961.00.  

 
1.8. Had the Accountable Officer and the Accountant conducted a periodic 

reconciliation of their records, the reconciling items of P696,636.43 could have 
been detected early, and adjustments effected promptly in the books. 

 
1.9. The failure to correct the abovementioned deficiencies has affected the accuracy of 

BiPSU’s financial statements. 
 
1.10. These audit observations are reiterations of the Audit Team’s findings in the CY 

2019 Cash Examination of the accounts of the same accountable officers where 
audit recommendations were communicated and discussed with Management. 
 

 
1.11. We recommended that the President require: 
 

a. the Accountant to: 
 

1. immediately draw the necessary adjusting accounting entries to correct 
the errors detailed in paragraphs 1.5 and 1.6 herein, in order to correct 

the balances of the affected accounts; and 
 

2. review the accounting entries as a control mechanism, prior to affixing 
the signature as certified correct, to preclude accumulation of 

accounting errors and to immediately correct errors; 

 

b. the Accountant and the Accountable Officer conduct a periodic 
reconciliation of their records at least quarterly prior to the preparation of 

financial reports to avoid accumulation of variances, pursuant to Sec. 6.3 

of COA Circular No. 97-002; and 

 

c. the Accountable Officer to immediately transfer the amount of P7,115.00 
from FC 06-BRF (IGP) account to FC 06-BRF (GI) account. 

 

1.12. The Accountant, in her written reply to the AOM, affirmed the errors found during 
the audit and informed the Audit Team that the accounting errors were already 
adjusted in March and April 2021. 

 

 

Variance between the balances in the GL and in the FS, P687,942.31; unreconciled 
discrepancy, P9,452,250.71 
 

2. The existence and accuracy of the Inventory account balances reported at  
P15,503,665.86 as of year end cannot be relied upon due to: a) the existence of 

a variance of P687,942.31 between the balances in the General Ledger and in 



 

39 
 

the Financial Statements; and b) an unreconciled discrepancy of P9,452,250.71 

between the balances in the Financial Statements and in the Report on the 

Physical Count of Inventory (RPCI), contrary to Section 111 of PD No. 1445 

and pertinent provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 

National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. 

 
2.1 Section 111 of PD No. 1445 provides thus: 
 

SECTION 111. Keeping of accounts. - (1) The accounts of 
an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the 
needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the 
information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. 

 
(2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and 

consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to 
safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. 

 
2.2 Likewise, the GAM for NGAs Volume I, pertinently provides: 

 

Chapter 2 

 

GENERAL PROVISIONS, BASIC STANDARDS AND 

POLICIES 

 
Sec. 15. Fair Presentation. The FSs shall present fairly the 

financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. 
Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of 
transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the 
definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, 
and expenses set out in PPSAS. The application of PPSAS, with 
appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair 
presentation of the FS.

2.4 As of December 31, 2020, the total balance of the Inventory accounts in the 

financial statements amounted to P15,503,665.86, summarized as follows:

Total P15,503,665.86 

 
2.5 Our review and verification of records relative to the Inventory accounts disclosed 

the following deficiencies: 
 

a) A variance of P687,942.31 was noted in the balances of two Inventory accounts 
as appearing in the General Ledger and in the Financial Statements of the Main 
Campus, detailed as follows: 
 
Table 12. Comparison of Inventory Account Balances Between the FS and the GL

Total-Main Campus P687,942.31 

 



 

41 
 

2.6 Our verification of the Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) No. 2012116 dated December 
31, 2020 showed that the variance of P687,842.31 pertains to the recording of the 
cost of buildings and other structures, which are still in the process of construction. 
The Construction Materials Inventory account was mistakenly used in the JEV, 
instead of the account Construction in Progress.  The transaction was not posted to 
the General Ledger but was reflected in the Financial Statements, hence the 
discrepancy. 

 
2.7 The general ledger is a master set of accounts that summarizes all transactions 

which, in turn, is used to aggregate information into the financial statements.  The 
accounting/bookkeeping error such as the presence of discrepancies between the 
General Ledger and the Financial Statement cast doubt on the reliability and 
accuracy of the presentation of the accounts in the BiPSU’s financial reports. 
 
b) Likewise, there is a discrepancy of P9,452,250.71 between the Inventory 

account balances in the Financial Statements and in the submitted RPCI, as 
shown in the table below:

2.8 Had the Accounting and the Supply Units conducted a periodic reconciliation of 
their records, these discrepancies could have been detected early, and the necessary 
adjustments in their records effected immediately. 

 

2.9 The existence of variances in the balances between the accounting and the supply 
records rendered the year-end Inventory account balances inaccurate, thereby 
affecting the fair presentation of these accounts in the Financial Statements. 

 
2.10 We recommended that henceforth the President require: 
 

(a) the Accountant to accurately and efficiently record all financial 
transactions in the books, and prepare the necessary adjusting/correcting 

entries, in order that the correct balance of the affected accounts shall be 

reflected in the books; and 

 

(b) the Accountant and the Supply Officer to reconcile their respective 
records to ascertain that all the inventories are duly accounted for; to 

make the necessary adjustments in both records to come up with the 

correct account balances; and to regularly conduct monthly or quarterly 

reconciliation of their records. 

 

2.11 In a written reply to the AOM, the University acknowledged the data entry errors 
committed which occurred during the running of the balances from the general 
ledger to the Trial Balance.  No adjusting entries were made since the general ledger 
balances of the affected accounts are in order. 

 

2.12 Although the University submitted a revised Notes to FS on May 3, 2021, the 
corrections of the errors in the Statement of Financial Position submitted on March 
17, 2021, which is part of this report, were not effected.  The year-end FS that the 
University submitted to GAFMIS, COA Central Office was the same FS submitted 
to the Audit Team on March 17, 2021. 

 

 

Unreconciled discrepancy, P105,365,947.66; Completed construction not classified to 
proper asset account, P17,936,467.50; Overstated Other Machinery and Equipment

3. The existence, accuracy and completeness of the year-end balance of the 

Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account reported at P620,249,438.14 

could not be ascertained due to the following deficiencies: a) unreconciled 

discrepancy of P105,365,947.66 in the balance between the financial 

statements and the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) submitted 

by the Main Campus; b) cost of completed construction of two school buildings 

totaling P17,936,467.50 not classified to proper asset account ; and 

c) overstated Other Machinery and Equipment account by P10,000,000.00 in

impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For 
check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall 
likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the 
receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be 
reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting 
Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property 
records like PAR.   

 
3.3 As of December 31, 2020, the total balance of the PPE in the financial statements 

amounted to P620,249,438.14, summarized as follows:

3.4 Our audit of the accounts and verification of related records revealed the following 
deficiencies: 

 
a. There is a substantial discrepancy of P105,365,947.66 in the balances in the 

Financial Statement and in the RPCPPE of the Main Campus. 

 

3.5 A comparison of the PPE balances reported in the Financial Statement and in the 
submitted RPCPPE of the Main Campus disclosed a discrepancy of 
P105,365,947.66, as shown in the following table:

3.6 Our review of the related financial reports and supporting documents, as well as the 
audit inquiry with the Accountant and the Supply Officer revealed that the 
discrepancies in the table above are attributed to the following: 

 
1) The three completed projects for the school water system costing 

P9,825,292.59, which were recorded as Water Supply System in the books of 
the Accounting Section, were classified as School Buildings in the RPCPPE 
prepared by the Supply Section.  Likewise, eight School Buildings in the 
RPCPPE totaling P56,597,255.17, which were constructed either as an addition 
or repair to an existing building, were not appropriately identified in the PPELC 
for School Building.  The details are summarized in the Table 16 below:

2) Records at the Supply Section showed that aside from the lump sum of the cost 

per class of the Building account, parts of the costs for the construction and 
repairs of infrastructure were again recorded in the RPCPPE, thereby 
overstating the particular PPE accounts, by the same amounts, as shown in 
Table 17 below.

pertains to the project Roofing System for the Basketball Court which was

constructed in CY 2017 but was not included in the RPCPPE prepared by the 
Supply Office. 

 
4) There are three items in the PPELC for Other Machineries and Equipment totaling 

P10,099,270.00 which were not in the RPCPPE for the same account, as follows: 
 

Table 18. List of Other Machineries and Equipment in PPELC but not in RPCPPE

Machineries and Equipment Stainless Water Tank 2000L 46,000.00 

TOTAL  P10,099,270.00  

 

5) PPE items recorded in the PPELC for Other Machineries and Equipment under 
Regular Agency Fund amounting to P248,260.00 was labeled “for Reconciliation”.  
The details as to the type of article and its date of acquisition and estimated useful 
life were not provided.  During the interview, the Accounting Section admitted that 
they could not identify what the balance was composed of because of the lack of 
documents on file. 

 
3.7 The importance of a periodic reconciliation of the records between the Accounting 

and the Supply Offices cannot be overemphasized.  All these errors and 
discrepancies could have been detected early and the necessary adjustments 
effected immediately so that these records and reports are fairly presented. 

 
b. The two completed school buildings amounting to P17,936,647.50 were not 

properly classified. 

 

3.8 During the year, the construction of two school buildings was completed.  These 
infrastructure projects which included: the Completion of Three-Storey Ceramics 
Building (Phase II) and the Completion of Student Center totaling P17,936,467.50 
were not reclassified as School Buildings as of year end.  Instead, they remained in 
the Construction in Progress account.  The details of the completed projects are as 
follows: 

 
Table 19.  Completed infrastructure projects as of December 31, 2020

Date Completed per 

Statement of Work

Completion of Student Center 9,962,086.00 10/30/2020 11/23/2020 
Total P17,936,467.50   

 
3.9 These errors in recording have understated the School Buildings account while 

overstating the Construction in Progress account.  Although these errors in 
classification had no effect on the total year-end balance of the PPE, they 



 

49 
 

nonetheless affected the accuracy of the presentation of the individual PPE account 
balances in the Financial Statements. 

 
c. Undelivered PPE items in the Other Machinery and Equipment account 

for P10,000,00.00 were erroneously recorded. 
 
3.10 The cost of the CY 2020 project, ARPA Radar Simulator, amounting to ten million 

was already recognized in the books and recorded as Other Machinery and 
Equipment when the said item has yet to be delivered and accepted by the 
University. 

 
3.11 This accounting error affected the fairness of presentation of the PPE account, 

Other Machinery and Equipment in the Financial Statements. 
 
3.12 We recommended that the President require the Accountant and the Supply 

Officer to: 

 

a. reconcile their respective records to ascertain that all the PPE items are 
duly accounted for; to make the necessary adjustments in both records to 

come up with correct account balances; and henceforth, to regularly 

conduct monthly or quarterly reconciliation of their records to minimize 

errors; and 

 

b. provide a new PPELC and PC for each category of PPE found at station 
and accomplish/fill out the data required as prescribed in the pertinent 

provisions of the GAM for NGAs.  For PPEs that could not be located or 

accounted for, the Supply Officer shall prepare a report as to the 

circumstances surrounding the loss, and submit the same to the University 

President for appropriate action/disposition. 

 

3.13 We also recommended that the Accountant accurately and efficiently record 
all financial transactions in the books, and prepare the necessary 

adjusting/correcting entries, to reflect the correct balance of the affected 

accounts. 

 

3.14 In the written replies by the Accountant and the Supply Officer, they affirmed the 
findings of the Audit Team on the proper recording of the 100% completed projects 
and the erroneous account titles provided in the PPELC and the RPCPPE.  
Likewise, the Supply Officer submitted the revised/corrected RPCPPE while the 
Accountant committed to draw JEVs to reclassify the erroneous account titles. 

 
3.15 Moreover, with regard to the recording of the undelivered ARPA Radar Simulator 

in the books, the Accountant stated that it was inadvertently recorded in the account, 
and committed to refraining from committing the same mistakes. 

 



 

50 
 

3.16 The Audit Team would like to emphasize that the records show that a JEV was 
drawn in December 2020 to record the same transaction by debiting the asset 
account and crediting the Accounts Payable account.  Existing rules on the 
recording of undelivered procurement as Accounts Payable is prohibited where 
administrative disciplinary action against the erring officials can be made for 
continuous disregard of the provisions of the regulations on payables. 

 
3.17 Likewise, the Accountant and the Supply Officer committed to adhere to the other 

recommendations in order to avoid the recurring audit findings of unreconciled 
balances between the Accounting and the Supply records. 

 

 

Erroneous accounting entries, P4,155,305.02 
 
4. The accuracy and fair presentation of the year-end balances of the 

Construction in Progress account amounting to P102,727,484.08; Advances to 

Contractors of P4,120,435.66; Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable account of 

P8,495,013.39; and Repairs and Maintenance Expense of P16,293,345.43 

cannot be ascertained due to erroneous accounting entries, contrary to Section 

111 of PD No. 1445 and GAM for NGAs, Volumes I and III. 

 
4.1 Section 111 of PD No. 1445 provides that: 
 

CHAPTER 2 

 

ACCOUNTS AND ACCOUNTING 

 

SECTION 111. Keeping of accounts. - (1) The accounts of 
an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the 
needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the 
information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.   
 

(2)  The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and 
consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to 
safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information. 

 

4.2 Likewise, Volume I of GAM for NGAs, pertinently provides: 
 

Chapter 10 

 

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 

 

Sec. 8. Purchase of PPE. PPE acquired through purchase 

are charged against appropriations/allotments or special budget for 
capital outlay. PPE can be purchased on cash basis, on account, on 
installment basis, with promotional items, and at a lump sum price.

g.  Construction of PPE. During the construction period, 
all expenses incurred in relation to the construction of the PPE 
shall be taken up in the books as Construction in Progress 
(CIP) with the appropriate asset classification. As soon as the 
construction is completed, the “Construction in Progress” 
account shall be reclassified to the proper asset account. 
Likewise, all expenses such as interests, license fees, etc., 
during the construction period shall be capitalized. 

 
Sec. 24. Repairs and Maintenance. Repairs and 

maintenance primarily maintain or improve the functionality and 
capacity of the PPE; increase its service life; improve the quality of 
its output; or reduce the operating cost. These may be categorized 
into major and minor repairs. Minor repairs shall be directly charged 
to expense account “Repairs and Maintenance” of the specific PPE 
while major repairs shall be added to the carrying amount of the PPE 
and shall be depreciated over the remaining life of the PPE. Where 
cost cannot easily be differentiated between a minor or major repair, 
it shall be treated as expense.

4.4 Our review of the documents submitted to the Audit Team relative to the paid 

transactions for the infrastructure projects of BiPSU Biliran Campus disclosed 
various errors in recording resulting in the misstatement of the account balances 
reported in the financial statement for CY 2020 due to the deficiencies as discussed 
hereunder: 

 
1. The Repair of Dormitory Building with a contract cost of P16,595,000.00 
involved the payment to the contractor of an aggregate amount of P12,107,274.05 
as of December 31, 2020 under its 3rd progress billing.  These payments were 
debited to the Repairs and Maintenance-Hostels and Dormitories expense account 



 

53 
 

instead of debiting to the Construction in Progress-Buildings and Other Structures 
account.  The details of these payments are presented in Table 20 below:

4.5 However, our verification of the contract and its supporting documents (i.e. 

Statements of Work Accomplished, Inspection Reports, and the Back-up 
Computations showing the actual work accomplished) revealed that the scope of 
work provided by the contractor included Removal of Structure and Obstruction, 
and Structure Excavation.  The item of work of structure excavation involves the 
removal of all materials of whatever nature, necessary for the construction of the 
foundation of buildings.  Further, the photographs attached to the progress billings 
showed that the existing building was completely demolished. 

 
4.6 Apparently, the old building was demolished to give way for the construction of a 

new one.  The Audit Team therefore concluded that the work undertaken was not 
only for repairs of the existing structure, but was actually for the construction of a 
new building.  Therefore, recording these transactions under the Construction in 
Progress-Buildings and Other Structures account could be more appropriate as it 
recognized the accumulated cost of the construction. 

 
4.7 The error in the accounting entries has resulted in the overstatement of the expenses 

of the University by P12,107,274.05 for CY 2020, and the understatement of the 
PPE account, Construction in Progress – Buildings and Other Structures, for the 
same amount.  

 
2. The BiPSU Biliran Campus erroneously recorded both the deduction of the 
retention fee, and recoupment of the mobilization fee for the Repair of Dormitory 
infrastructure project as Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable.  Volume III of the 
GAM for NGAs prescribes debiting the Advances to Contractors account upon 
payment of the mobilization fee to the contractor and crediting upon recoupment of 
the advances in every progress billing.  The details of these errors are presented in 
Table 21: 

 Table 21. Details of Errors in Accounting Entries for the Repair of Dormitory 



 

54 
 

 
4.8 The errors in recording has resulted in the overstatement of the Guaranty/Security 

Deposits Payable account by P1,666,055.02, and the understatement of the 
Advances to Contractors account by the net amount of P823,194.98, whereby the 
amount of P2,489,250.00 is debited to the account while crediting the amount of 
P1,666,055.02. 

 

4.9 We recommended that the President require the Bookkeeper of the BiPSU 
Biliran Campus to draw the necessary adjusting journal entries to correct the 

erroneous recording of transactions so that these accounts are fairly presented 

in the financial statements for the period. 

 

4.10 We also recommended the following adjusting entries to correct the errors: 
 

1.  To recognize the payment of 15% mobilization fee: 
 

Advances to Contractors  P2,489,250.00 

Accumulated Surplus/Deficit P2,489,250.00

4.11 The Bookkeeper, in her written reply to the AOM, affirmed the errors found during 
the audit and committed to record the suggested adjusting journal entries.   

 
 
Overstated Accounts Payable, P10,000,000.00 
 
5. The Accounts Payable year-end balance amounting to P17,474,249.23 is 

overstated by ten million because of the recording of undelivered equipment 

in the account. 

 

5.1 The GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides the following: 
 

Chapter 2 

 

GENERAL PROVISIONS, BASIC STANDARDS AND 

POLICIES 

  

Sec. 5. Fundamental Principles for Disbursement of

f. Claims against government funds shall be supported with 

complete documentation. 
 

Xxx 
 

Sec. 37. Certification of Availability of Funds. Xxx 

 
No obligation shall be certified to accounts payable unless the 

obligation is founded on a valid claim that is properly supported by 
sufficient evidence and unless there is proper authority for its incurrence.

service, without prejudice to criminal prosecution under the provisions of 
the Revised Penal Code. Any payment made under such certification shall 
be illegal and every official authorizing or making such payment, or taking 
part therein or receiving such payment, shall be jointly and severally liable

5.2 Likewise,  Section 4 of the COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2013-1 dated March 15, 

2013 defines key terminologies in connection with government budgeting and 
disbursements: 



 

57 
 

 

4.0 DEFINITION OF TERMS  

 
 Xxx 

 
4.6 Accounts Payable-obligations of government agencies, 

whether current year or prior years, for which services 
had been rendered, goods have been delivered or 
projects have been completed and accepted. 

 
4.7 Commitment – and obligation incurred by the 

government agencies for which items have not yet been 
delivered and services not yet rendered. This is also 
called “Obligations Not Yet Due and Demandable.” 

 
5.3 In connection with the above directive, COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2019-1 dated 

January 1, 2019 states: 
 

4.0 GUIDELINES  
 

Xxx 
 

4.3 Departments/Agencies/OUs shall accomplish and submit 
BFARs to COA, DBM, and to BTr, as applicable through the URS, 
in accordance with the timelines prescribed in the pertinent section 
of the GP of the GAA for the Budget Year, to wit:    On or before 
30th day following the end of the year FAR No. 3, entitled “AGING 
OF UNPAID OBLIGATIONS”. 

 
The first column under the FAR 3 identifies under B. Not Yet Due 
and Demandable Obligations - Obligations, of NGA COs/ROs/OUs 
and GOCCs maintaining SAGF, charged against current year and 
prior years' budget for which goods, services and projects are not yet 
delivered, rendered, completed and/or accepted during the year.  

 
5.4 The balance of the Accounts Payable of BiPSU as shown in the Consolidated 

Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020 is reported at 
P17,474,249.23, as presented in the table below:

5.5 In CY 2020, the University procured an ARPA Radar Simulator (Full Mission Ship 
Bridge Simulator) with complete accessories costing ten million pesos.  The Notice 
to Proceed was received by the winning bidder, PCI Innovations Tech Center, Inc. 



 

58 
 

on October 28, 2020.  The contract called for the delivery of the said item within 
120 calendar days from the receipt of the supplier of the Notice to Proceed.  
However, the equipment was delivered only on April 26, 2021 per Inspection and 
Acceptance Report submitted on April 30, 2021. 

 

5.6 Nevertheless, the procurement was recognized in the books as Accounts Payable 
even if the equipment was not yet delivered and accepted by the University as of 
December 31, 2020.  The Accountant explained that it was inadvertently recorded 
as such, when their intention was only to record it as Not Yet Due and Demandable 
Obligations. 

 
5.7 The recording of ten million pesos for the undelivered ARPA Radar Simulator (Full 

Mission Ship Bridge Simulator) as accounts payable is questionable because it 
prevents the undisbursed fund from being reverted to the unappropriated surplus of 
the General Fund.  The recording as Accounts Payable would allow the reverted 
fund to be included in the General Allotment Release Order (GARO) or Statement 
of Allotment Release Order (SARO) for the succeeding year.  A GARO/SARO is 
issued for reverted and legitimate claims for which the actual transactions, i.e. 
delivery of goods and services, have already been completed. 

 
5.8 The undelivered equipment should not have been recognized as Accounts Payable 

in the books, but instead should have been disclosed only as Not Yet Due and 
Demandable in the FAR 1- SAAObDB for Regular Agency Fund and FAR 2-
Summary of Approved Budget, Utilizations, Disbursements and Balances 
(SABUDB) for off-budgetary funds.  The same should also have been disclosed in 
the Notes to Financial Statements. 

 
5.9 The maximum utilization of allotted funds has a favorable effect on fund 

management when done in adherence/consonance with existing rules and 
regulations.  However, the recognition as accounts payable of procurements for 
which no actual delivery of goods was made is contrary to the above-mentioned 
rules and regulations and has resulted in the overstatement of the Accounts Payable 
and the PPE account Other Machinery and Equipment accounts. 

 

5.10 We recommended that the President require the Accountant to: 
 

a. Ensure that obligations booked up as Accounts Payable are valid and legal, 
and for which goods, services, and projects have been delivered, rendered, 

completed and accepted; and 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

59 
 

b. Prepare the necessary adjusting entries to reflect the correct balances of 
the Accounts Payable and other accounts affected. 

 

5.11 In a written reply, the Accountant stated that the procurement of the equipment was 
inadvertently recorded as Accounts Payable when the intention was to record the 
same in the List of Not Yet Due and Demandable Obligations. 

 

5.12 Again the Audit Team would like to emphasize that the continuous disregard of the 
provisions of the rules on the recording of accounts payable may result in 
administrative disciplinary sanctions against the erring officials involved in the 
transaction. 

 

 

Procedural lapses in the procurement process, P146,350,104.57 
 

6. Projects totalling P146,350,104.57 procured during the year involved 
deficiencies contrary to pertinent provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184 

(Government Procurement Reform Act) and its 2016 Revised Implementing 

Rules and Regulations (RIRR) and COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated 

February 12, 2009. 

 

6.1 The RA No. 9184, otherwise known as the Procurement Act, was enacted to ensure 
that all procurements of the government, its departments and instrumentalities shall 
be governed by the principles of transparency, competitiveness, and efficiency, as 
well as accountability. 

 

6.2 To promote transparency and efficiency, information and communication 
technology shall be utilized in the conduct of procurement procedures.  
Accordingly, there shall be a single portal that shall serve as the primary source of 
information on all government procurements: the Philippine Government 
Electronic Procurement System (PhilGEPS). 

 

6.3 Accordingly, Section 3 of RA No. 9184 enumerates the governing principles on 
government procurements, which includes, among others, the principles of 
transparency and competitiveness in the procurement process. 

 
6.4 Sections 37 and 39 of Rule XI of the same 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184 states that: 
 

Section 37. Notice and Execution of Award 
 

37.1. Contract Award

(Single Rated    and Responsive Bid) after the 
post-qualification process has been completed. 

 
Xxx 

 
37.1.2  Within a period not exceeding fifteen (15) 

calendar days from the determination by the 
BAC of the bidder with the LCRB, HRRB, 
SCRB, or SRRB, and the recommendation to

disapprove the said recommendation. 

 
37.1.3  In case of approval, the HoPE shall 

immediately issue the Notice of Award to the 
bidder with the LCB, HRRB, SCRB or SRRB. 

 
37.1.6. The BAC, through the Secretariat, shall post, 

within three (3) calendar days from its 
issuance, the Notice of Award in the PhilGEPS, 
the website of the procuring entity, if any, and 
any conspicuous place in the premises of the 
procuring entity. 

 
Xxx  

 
37.2.2 The Procuring Entity shall enter into contract 

with the winning bidder within the same ten 
(10) day period provided that all the 
documentary requirements are complied with. 

 
37.4.2. The Procuring Entity, through the BAC 

Secretariat, shall post a copy of the Notice to 
Proceed and the approved contract in the 
PhilGEPS, the website of the procuring entity, 
if any, within fifteen (15) calendar days from 
the issuance of the Notice to Proceed. 

 
  Xxx  
 

 39. Performance Security 
 

39.1. To guarantee the faithful performance by the winning          
bidder of its obligations under the contract in accordance 



 

61 
 

with the Bidding Documents, it shall post a performance 
security prior to the signing of the contract. 

 
39.2. The performance security shall be in an amount not less 

than the required percentage of the total contract price in 
accordance with the following schedule:   

 

 Form of Performance Security 

Amount of Performance Security 

(Not less than the required 

percentage of the Total Contract

Thirty percent (30%) 

 
6.5 Likewise, Sections 3.1.1 and 4.1 of the COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 

12, 2009 provides thus: 
 

3.1.1  Within five (5) working days from the execution of a 
contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, 
agencies or instrumentalities, including government-
owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, 
a copy of said contract and each of all the documents 
forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be 
furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned. Xxx 

 
4.1   Any unjustified failure of the officials and employees 

concerned to comply with the requirements shall be 
subject to the administrative disciplinary action provided 



 

62 
 

in (a) Section 127 of Presidential Decree No. 1445; (b) 
Section 55, Title 1-B, Book V of the Revised 
Administrative Code of 1987; and (c) Section 11 of 
Republic Act No.  6713. 

 
6.6 During our audit for the year, we noted that BiPSU conducted public bidding for 

the procurement of nine infrastructure and non-infrastructure projects in CY 2020

f) Further, no Performance Security was posted prior to the contract signing 
dated October 26, 2020 for the project ARPA Radar Simulator, contrary to Section 
39.1 of RA No. 9184 and its RIRR. 

 
Our verification of this contract disclosed that performance security totaling 

Five Hundred Thousand (P500,000.00) was received in check on January 20, 2021 
by the BAC Secretariat Head without an official receipt issued in 
acknowledgement thereof and without accounting therefor as government funds; 
rather he deposited the check to his personal account also on January 20, 2021, 
contrary to Sections 63 and 69 of PD No. 1445. 

 
6.8 We recommended that the President: 
 

3) require the BAC Chairperson and the BAC Secretariat Head to submit 
an explanation for the repeated deviations in their procurement 

activities; and 

 

4) instruct the BAC to strictly comply with the procurement processes 
required by RA No. 9184 and its RIRR in line with the government’s 

commitment to promote good governance and effort to adhere to the 

principles of transparency, accountability, equity, efficiency and 

economy in procurement. 

 

6.9 These recommendations are without prejudice to the issuance of Notices of 
Suspension and/or Disallowance resulting from post-audit of transactions. 

 
6.10 Quoted hereunder are the BiPSU Management comments: 
 

“The university would like to request for consideration on the 
schedules of the issuance of the Notice of Award and the Notice to 
Proceed on the 2020 infrastructure and non-infrastructure projects 
due to the impaired staffing patterns in the university during the 
pandemic, particularly the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC), 
among others, as explained below: 

 
It can be recalled that five (5) days from the approval of various 
projects by the BiPSU Board of Regents, the university has 
implemented the university-wide class and office suspension for the 
sanitation of classrooms and offices and as a precautionary measure 
for the COVID 19 outbreak.  The advisory was further extended in 



 

66 
 

compliance with Executive Order No. 14, s. 2020 of the Biliran 
Provincial Governor and the CHED Advisory No. 4, s. 2020 limiting 
the skeletal workforce in the university, as reflected in the BiPSU 
OP Memorandum Order No. 18, s. 2020.  Such issuances only 
allowed essential/frontline offices to report to work (excluding the 
BAC). 

 
The abovementioned issuances were further superseded by various 
subsequent orders/advisories which in fact, imposed stricter border 
closures and stricter regulations on the entry of employees in the 
university premises.  These growing uncertainties resulted in a 
longer work suspension upon the employees including BAC 
members and the Secretariat, thus, causing the unforeseen delay of 
the office duties. 

 
Further, these circumstances likewise developed more challenges 
particularly to the winning bidders who encountered difficulties in 
personally visiting the campus for the receipt of the Notice to 
Proceed. 

 
Moreover, the posting in the PhilGEPS website was delayed due to 
the 1) frequent maintenance of the PhilGEPS website which 
rendered it inaccessible for months, 2) lack of internet connectivity 
with in the BAC Office or in the campus in general, and 3) the 
transition towards the new composition of the BAC Secretariat. 

 
To mitigate the internet connectivity issue and to ensure smooth 
operation of the various offices of the university, a procurement 
process is ongoing to subscribe and install internet connectivity to 
several office of the university including the BAC for its prompt 
performance of duties. 

 
Lastly, the university reiterates its commitment toward the 
transparency of the procurement activities.  Despite the challenges, 
the university even ensured that members of the BAC shall 
participate in webinars related to the procurement process in 
December of 2020 (including other upcoming webinars) and that all 
relevant procurement activities are to be posted on the BiPSU 
website – a discretionary act per recommendation in the 2016 
Revised IRR of RA 9184.” 

 

6.11 The University’s justification on the reasons for the delays on the scheduled 
implementation of the activities in the different stages of the procurement process 
like the immediate issuance of the NOA and the NTP, among others, were due to 
the restrictions of the Covid-19 pandemic which started in the middle of March 
2020, and as such has no bearing because almost all the projects were already done 



 

67 
 

in all the stages of the procurement process before the pandemic.  Specifically, 
projects 1 to 7 in Table 3 above shows that the BAC Resolutions recommending 
the award were dated on January 9, 2020 and the latest was February 17, 2020.  The 
lockdown only started in the middle of March 2020.  Further, the communications 
to the winning bidders can be made through other means like emails. 

 

6.12 While the absence of skeletal workforce in the BAC Secretariat Office is 
inconsistent with Office of the University President (BiPSU) Memo dated March 
19, 2020 which emphasized that in order to ensure the operation will not be 
hampered, subject to the approval of the University President, a work scheme shall 
be devised within their office.  The work scheme pertains to rotation/shifting of 
work schedule with due observance to the social distancing policy and other 
precautionary measures.  Almost all offices in the University had skeletal 
workforce as implied in the Office of the University President (BiPSU) Memo.  The 
functions of the BAC Office is equally important to other offices in the University 
and yet no skeletal workforce was provided to the office during the period. 

 

6.13 The University did not make comments on the absence of “Dates of Receipt “and/or 
“Dates of Approval” on the BAC Resolutions declaring the LCRB and 
recommending to the HoPE the award of the contract. 
 

6.14 The Audit Team would like to emphasize that the continued disregard of the 
requirements in the procurement process by the officers and employees concerned 
may result in the imposition of the penalties provided in Article XXI Section 65 of 
RA No. 9184 on The Government Procurement Act. 

 

 

Suspension of work and contract time extension not adequately documented 
 

7. The suspension of work and contract time extension of eight (8) infrastructure 
projects were not adequately documented, contrary to pertinent provisions of 

Annex A of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 and the Manual of Procedures for the 

Procurement of Infrastructure Projects issued by the Government 

Procurement Policy Board (GPPB). 

 

7.1 Item No. 3 (j) of Annex A of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184 provides thus: 
 

3. Work under detailed engineering shall include, but not necessarily 
be limited to, the following: 

 
j) Contract Time or Duration – In the preparation of the Bidding 

Documents, the agency shall make estimate of the actual 
number of working days required to complete the project 
through PERT/CPM analysis of the project activities and 
corrected for holidays and weekends.  Likewise, the agency 
shall make an estimate of the number of rainy/unworkable days 



 

68 
 

considered unfavorable for the prosecution of the works at the 
site, based on the records of the Philippine Atmospheric, 
Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration 
(PAGASA) and incorporate the same in the corrected actual 
number of working days determined above, which shall be 
made the basis of the total contract time.  The estimated number 
of rainy/unworkable days considered unfavorable for the 
prosecution of the works at the site shall be made known before 
the date of bidding through the Instructions to Bidders for the 
purpose of guiding the contractor in preparing his bid and as a 
reference to both the GOP and the winning contractors taking 
action on the requests for time extensions. Without the 
estimated number of rainy/unworkable days established before 
the bidding date and made known to all participating bidders, 
the contact time is presumed to have excluded the unfavorable 
conditions.  

 
7.2 The Manual of Procedures for the Procurement of Infrastructure Projects, Volume 

III issued by the GPPB (GPPB Manual) provides the rule on the applicable period 
for the completion of work, thus: 

 
The contractor must complete the work procured within the period 
prescribed by the Procuring Entity as specified in the contract.  If 
delays are likely to be incurred, the contractor must notify the 
Procuring Entity in writing, stating therein the duration and causes 
of the expected delay.  The Procuring Entity may grant time 
extensions, at its discretion, if such extensions are meritorious, with 
or without liquidated damages.  In all cases, the request for extension 
shall always be filed before the expiry of the original completion 
date.  Maximum allowable extension shall not exceed the original 
construction period. (emphasis ours) 

 
7.3 The GPPB Manual discusses the steps to be undertaken when contract extension is 

unavoidable, as follows: 
 

Methodology: How must a request for extension be handled if a 
contractor incurs a delay and wishes to request for an 
extension of the completion or construction period: 

 
1. It must submit a written request to the PMO or 

end-user unit for an extension of the completion 
or construction period, citing the reason/s for 
such delay. 

 
2. The PMO or end-user unit shall either approve 

or disapprove the request for extension. 



 

69 
 

 
3. If the extension is granted, the liquidated 

damages shall not be imposed and the contractor 
will be so informed in writing. 

 
4. If, however, the request for extension is denied, 

the PMO or end-user unit shall inform the 
contractor in writing of such denial, and ensure 
that the said notice or communication is received 
by the latter within a reasonable time from 
receipt of the request for extension. The 
Procuring Entity then imposes the liquidated 
damages in accordance with the provisions of 
the contract and the procedures outlined below. 

 
7.4 The BiPSU Main and Biliran Campus implemented in CY 2020 the following 

infrastructure projects aggregating P136,350,104.57:

Note: Data in column (d) is sourced from Award Notice posted in PhilGEPs while data in column 
(f) is the result of the audit by the Audit Team (computed from target date of completion to the actual 
date of completion or latest Inspection Report for the unfinished projects). 

 

7.6 As shown in Table 28, the contract time for Project Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 were 
extended for 58 days to 180 days while Project No. 4 involving the Repair of 
Technology Building Phase 5, which was set to be completed on January 12, 2021, 
was likewise extended to February 1, 2021 per attached Statement of Time Elapsed 
and Work Accomplished submitted with the progress billings. 
 

7.7 The personnel at the Engineering and General Services Office (EGSO) of the 
BiPSU said that the delays in the completion of the projects were due to the 
quarantine restrictions brought about by the COVID 19 pandemic.  The Audit Team 
then requested from the University, through the Project Engineer, to submit the 
approved written requests for: (1) contract time extension, (2) work suspension 
orders, (3) work resumption orders, and (4) variation orders, where necessary, that 
would justify the time extensions for completion.  The only document provided to 
the Audit Team was a Board of Regents (BOR) resolution issued on September 14, 
2020 granting contract time extensions for the abovementioned infrastructure 
projects. 



 

71 
 

 
7.8 Moreover, it was not clear as to when the contractors resumed work on these 

projects since there were no resumption orders issued.  Under existing rules and 
regulations, the approved requests for contract time extension authorize the 
procuring entity to collect liquidated damages from the contractors. 

 
7.9 The absence of these required documents precluded the Audit Team to determine 

if these delays in completion were indeed valid and sanctioned by the HoPE.  The 
BiPSU should have required the contractors to act immediately on matters relating 
to work suspensions, resumption orders, and contract time extensions in accordance 
with existing rules and regulations.  This ensures that transparency, a system of 
accountability and public monitoring in the effective implementation, is in place. 

 
7.10 We recommended that the President:  
 

c) direct the Engineering and General Services Office: 
 

3. to efficiently monitor the implementation of all infrastructure projects; 
undertake the necessary steps when the time for completion of the 

projects is extended; and to notify defaulting contractors at any time 

during the implementation of the projects whenever there is deviation 

from the PERT/CPM, and the sanctions therein; and 

 

4. to ensure the immediate completion of the ongoing projects with the 
end-goal of maximizing the utilization of the budgeted funds and timely 

delivery of improved facilities that would benefit the students and 

employees of the University; 

 

d) impose liquidated damages, if warranted, equal to at least one tenth (1/10) 
of one (1) percent of the cost of the unperformed portion of the works for 

every day of delay of the defaulting contractor. 
 
7.11 The University submitted the following documents during the last week of May 

2021: 
 
1. Request for Work Suspension Order No.1 dated March 22, 2020 for projects 

nos. 5 and 6 in Table 28 and the request for approval of contract time extension 
for project no. 5 in the same aforecited Table; 

 
2. Revised PERT-CPM for the Repair of Dormitory Building ; 
 
3. BiPSU’s Board of Regents (BOR) Resolution No. 38 Series of 2020 re 

resolution approving the grant of contract time extension on the construction 
of the various infrastructure projects at BiPSU dated September 14, 2020; and 

 
4. Local Executive Orders No. 18 and 18A Series of 2020. 



 

72 
 

 
7.12 The University’s date of approval of the time extension of various project through 

the BiPSU’s BOR Resolution No. 38 was dated September 14, 2020.  Records 
showed that the original contract time for projects Nos 1, 2, 3, 4 & 7 had already 
expired before the approval of the extension.   Moreover, there was no request for 
extension from the contractors’ end except the one in paragraph 7.11.  Lastly, the 
law is clear that the maximum allowable extension shall not exceed the original 
construction period, and yet the records disclose that some projects were extended 
more than the number of days of the original construction period as gleaned from 
Table 28. 

 
7.13 The welfare of the University and its stakeholders should always be the primary 

concern of the Management.  Hence, the laxity in the part of the Management in 
the implementation of the projects does not ensure that the government funds are 
efficiently and effectively utilized for the welfare of the end-users. 
 
 

Lacking documentary requirements, P109,043,995.28 
 

8. Various documentary requirements were not attached to the disbursement 
vouchers to support a number of payments to the contractors of the 

infrastructure projects totaling P109,043,995.28, rendering the validity and 

propriety of the subject transactions doubtful. 
 
8.1 Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445, provides: 
 

Section 4.  Fundamental principles. – Financial 
transactions and operations of any government agency shall be 
governed by the fundamental principles set forth hereunder, to wit: 

 
Xxx 

 
(6) Claims against government funds shall be supported with 

complete documentation. 
 
8.2 Further, Item 9.1.1 COA Circular No. 2012-001 (Revised Documentary 

Requirements for Common Government Transactions) dated June 14, 2012 
enumerates the documentary requirements for all stages of the infrastructure 
billings for infrastructure disbursements, like advance payment, progress payment, 
final payment, and release of retention money. 

 
8.3 Our audit of the disbursements for infrastructure projects of the University totaling 

P109,043,995.28 for CY 2020 disclosed billings for the following projects with 
incomplete documentation:

8.6 In the written reply to the AOM, the Accountant affirmed their lapses and submitted 

the Revised PERT/CPM for the Repair of Dormitory Building of BiPSU Biliran 
Campus only. Other lacking documents as listed in Table 29 have yet to be

Non-deduction of the ten percent retention money 
 
9. Management failed to impose the 10% retention money amounting 

to P3,805,433.83 required from the progress billings due to contractors, 

contrary to Items 5.3 and 6.1 of Annex E of the RIRR of RA No. 9184. 
 
9.1 Sections 5.3 and 6.1, Annex E of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 provides 

that: 
 

5. PROGRESS PAYMENT 

 
Xxx 

 
5.3 The procuring entity shall deduct the following from the 

certified gross amounts to be paid to the contactor as 
progress payment: 

 
a) Cumulative value of the work previously certified 

and paid for. 



 

75 
 

b) Portion of the advance payment to be recouped for 
the month. 

c) Retention money in accordance with the condition 
of contract. 

d) Amount to cover third party liabilities. 
e) Amount to cover uncorrected discovered defects in 

the works 
 

6. RETENTION MONEY  

 

6.1 Progress payments are subject to retention of 10 percent 
(10%) referred to as the “retention money.”  Such retention 
shall be based on the total amount due to the contractor 
prior to any deduction and shall be retained from every 
progress payment until fifty percent (50%) of the value of 
works, as determined by the procuring entity, are 
completed.  If after fifty percent (50%) completion, the 
work is satisfactorily done and on schedule, no additional 
retention shall be made; otherwise, the ten percent (10%) 
retention shall be imposed 

 
6.2 The total retention money shall be due for release upon 

final acceptance of the works.  The contractor may, 
however, request the substitution of the retention money 
for each progress billing with irrevocable standby letters of 
credit from a commercial bank, bank guarantees or surety 
bonds callable on demand of amounts equivalent to the 
retention money substituted for and acceptable to 
Government, provided the project is on schedule and is 
satisfactorily undertaken. Xxx. 

 
9.2 Our verification of the payments for infrastructure projects showed that the 10% 

retention money amounting to P3,805,433.85 was not retained from the progress 
billings with less than 50% completion per approved Statement of Work 
Accomplished, as detailed in Table 30 below:

9.3 Our post audit also disclosed that there were no submitted copies of the irrevocable 

standby letters of credit from a commercial bank, bank guarantees or surety bonds 
callable on demand in lieu of the retention money required from the progress 
billings.  The retention money was deducted only during the final payment to the 
contractors. 

 
9.4 The purpose of retention to ensure that the contractor properly completes the project 

required under the contract; it is the sum of money held by the procuring entity as 
a protection against defective or non-conforming work by the contractor.  The 
practice therefore of not withholding any retention money from the billings does 
not ensure that government funds are safeguarded against any defects which can 
occur during the defects liability period if the contractor does not respond 
according to the contract terms. 

 
9.5 We recommended that henceforth, the President require the Accountant to 

strictly adhere to the law, rules and regulations on the deduction of the ten 

percent (10%) retention money from every progress payment. 

 

9.6 The above observation is without prejudice to the issuance of a Notice of 
Suspension/Disallowance, where appropriate. 

 
9.7 Quoted hereunder are the BiPSU Management comments: 

 
It is the humble submission of the University that the concerned 
officials were acting in good faith in executing these precepts of law 
“Items 5.3 and 6.1 of Annex E of the RIRR of RA No. 9184” on the 
basis of the inadvertent error in the assimilation of the same. Be that 
as it may, it is worthy to note that while admittedly the University 
Accountant failed to retain the required ten percent (10%) retention 
money from every progress payment until fifty percent (50%) of the 
project is completed, which had been made instead at the final 
progress billing with the contractor being required to submit 
warranty security and/or surety bond, the personnel from the 
Engineering and General Services Office (EGSO) have been 
faithfully and closely monitoring all the infrastructure projects of the 

https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Contract


 

77 
 

University in its further efforts to ascertain that they are worked by 
the concerned contractors in all respects as planned.  
 
Hence, by far, end users of these projects have not come across 
significant defects or problems that require major repair/s after their 
complete delivery. Moreover, it can be noted that the University is 
even bolstered with remedies as Article 1723 of the New Civil Code 
of the Philippines provides that “The engineer or architect who drew 
up plans and specifications for a building is liable for damages if 
within fifteen years from the completion of the structure, the same 
should collapse by reason of a defect in those plans and 
specifications, or due to the defects in the ground. The contractor is 
likewise responsible for the damages if the edifice falls, within the 
same period, on account of defects in the construction or the use of 
materials of inferior quality furnished by him, or due to any 
violation of the terms of the contract. If the engineer or architect 
supervises the construction, he shall be solidarily liable with the 
contractor”. 
 
Lastly, be it noted that the University through its Accountant has 
commenced putting into implementation the foregoing provisions of 
law for this year’s infrastructure projects at BiPSU. 
 

9.8 Once again we wish to emphasize that the University is not given the option, at 
their convenience, to decide whether or not to impose retention money for all 
infrastructure projects undertaken under RA No. 9184 and its RIRR.  It is clearly 
required by Item 6.1, Annex E of the law, that every progress payment should be 
subject to the retention of ten percent (10%)  until fifty percent (50%) of the value 
of works, as determined by the procuring entity, are completed. And if after 50% 
completion, the work is satisfactorily done and on schedule, no additional retention 
shall be made; otherwise the ten percent (10%) retention shall continue to be 
imposed.  
 

9.9 Further, the retention money provides protection to the University against the 
contractor’s failure to complete the work on schedule, and to ensure that the project 
is done in accordance with the design and quality as stated in the contract.  The 
EGSO personnel’s faithful and close monitoring of the infrastructure projects does 
not provide the same guarantee as the one provided by the law.  In fact, most of the 
infrastructure projects without the deduction of the retention money were extended 
or incurred delays as discussed in Finding No. 7.  
 

9.10 To note, in CY 2018 Annual Audit Report of the University, the same issue on the 
non-deduction of the retention money was reported therein and the management 
committed to adhere to the prescribed regulations. 
 



 

78 
 

9.11 Again, the welfare of the University and its stakeholders should always be the 
primary concern of the Management.  Hence, laxity in the part of the Management 
in the implementation of the project exposes the University of not being protected 
due to non-deduction of retention money for every progress payment, among 
others. 

 

GPB below the requirement of at least 5% of the total appropriations; attribution of major 
projects not subjected to HGDG 
 

10. The University’s allocation for GAD programs in the GAD Plan and Budget 
(GPB) was below the requirement of at least 5% of the total appropriations,  

while the attribution of two major projects to the GAD budget was not 

subjected to gender analysis using the Harmonized Gender and Development 

Guidelines (HGDG) tool, contrary to the pertinent provisions of Philippine 

Commission on Women (PCW), National Economic Development Authority 

(NEDA) and Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Joint Circular 

No. 2012-01 and Section 31 of the General Provisions of the General 

Appropriations Act (GAA) FY 2020. 

 
10.1 Pertinent provisions of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 are as 

follows: 
 

3.0 GENERAL GUIDELINES IN GAD PLANNING AND 

BUDGETING 

 

Xxx 
 

3.4  Mainstreaming gender perspectives in agency PAPs to 
attain the desired outcomes for GAD shall be a priority in 
GAD planning and budgeting.  Using the 5% GAD budget 
for gender mainstreaming is a way for agencies to influence 
the entire agency program, plan and budget.  To aid gender 
mainstreaming, agencies shall perform gender analysis 
using existing tools such as Harmonized Gender and 
Development Guidelines (HGDG), to ensure that the 
different concerns of women and men are addressed equally 
and equitably in their PPAs.  Activities to address these 
differential concerns through capacity development on 
GAD or GAD-focused activities shall be included in agency 
GPBs. 

 
6.0 COSTING AND ALLOCATION OF THE GAD BUDGET 

 
6.1 At least five percent of the total agency budget 

appropriations authorized under the annual GAA shall 
correspond to activities    supporting   GAD    plans      and  



 

79 
 

 
       programs. The GAD budget shall be drawn from the 

agency’s maintenance and other operating expenses 
(MOOE), capital outlay (CO), and personal services (PS). 
It is understood that the GAD budget does not constitute an 
additional budget over an agency’s total budget 
appropriations. 

 
Xxx 

 
6.4  Attributing agency major programs to the GAD budget.  

Attribution to the GAD budget of a portion or the whole of 
the budget of an agency’s major programs is a means 
toward gradually increasing the gender responsiveness of 
government programs and budgets. 

 
6.4.1 If an agency intends to attribute a portion or the 

whole budget of major programs during the GAD 
planning and budgeting phase, it may subject the 
program to gender analysis using the HGDG tool. If 
the agency is not yet trained on the use of the tool, it 
may include said training in its GPB and may seek 
the assistance of an expert on gender analysis using 
the HGDG.  

 
6.4.2  The use of the HGDG will yield a maximum score of 

20 points for each program or project. Depending on 
the score on the HGDG, a percentage of the budget 
of the agency’s existing and proposed major program 
may be attributed to the GAD budget as follows: 

 

HGDG Score Description 

Corresponding budget for 

the year of the program that 

may be attributed to the 

GAD budget 

Below 4.0 GAD is invisible 0% or no amount of the 
program budget for the year 
may be attributed to the GAD 
budget 

4.0-7.9 Promising GAD 
prospects 
(conditional pass) 

25% of the budget for the year 
of the program may be 
attributed to the GAD budget 

8.0-14.9 Gender sensitive 50% of the budget for the year 
of the program may be 
attributed to the GAD budget 



 

80 
 

15.0-19.9 Gender-responsive 75% of the budget for the year 
of the program may be 
attributed to the GAD budget 

20.0 Fully gender-
responsive 

100% of the budget for the 
year of the program may be 
attributed to the GAD budget 

 
Xxx 

 
6.4.4 During the preparation of its GAD AR, the agency 

will again administer the HGDG test to determine the 
extent that the targeted HGDG score is attained. This 
score will be the basis in determining actual 
expenditure that can be attributed to the GAD 
budget. 

 
10.2 Section 31 of the General Provisions of GAA FY 2020 provides: 
 

Sec. 31. Programs and Projects Related to Gender and 

Development.  
 

Xxx 
 

The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 
agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. 
For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies 
which related to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, 
economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, 
protection, promotion, and fulfilment of women’s human rights, and 
practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient 
compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget 
shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators 
identified by said agencies. 

 
10.3 Our audit of the GAD plans and programs for the year revealed that the CY 2020 

GPB of BiPSU was already endorsed by the PCW as of July 20, 2020.  However, 
it was discovered through the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) 
that the related GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) for the year, though already 
submitted to PCW, was still for review as of March 5, 2021. 

 
10.4 The two focused activities indicated in the GPB are client-focused and 

organization-focused.  The organization-focused GAD activities amounting to 
P8,640,000.00 constituted 62% of the total budget of the University for the GAD, 
while the remaining activities amounting to P5,295,000.00 or 38% were client-
focused.  In the GAD Accomplishment Report, the BiPSU was able to utilize only 



 

81 
 

2.40% of the approved GPB due to restrictions brought by COVID-19 pandemic.  
Details are shown in Table 31 below: 

 
 
Table 31: Comparison of CY 2020 GPB and GAD AR  

GAD Activities GPB % for the 

Total 

Budget for 

GAD 

GAD AR % of

Total P13,935,000.00 100% P334,459.69 2.40% 

 
10.5 However, our review of the pertinent documents on GAD implementation during 

the year such as the GPB and the related GAD AR, among others, disclosed the 
following: 

 
1) The GPB showed that the total GAD budget of P13,935,000.00 constitutes only 

4.13% of the BiPSU’s CY 2020 appropriations of P337,158,000.00, contrary to 
the required allocation amounting to at least P16,857,900.00 or five percent as 
prescribed under the General Appropriations Act for FY 2020. 

 
2)  Two major GAD projects/activities, the Maintenance of Lactation Room and 

the Maintenance of Day Care Center, had an allotted budget of P600,000.00 
and P850,000.00, respectively.  The two programs were not undertaken during 
the year,  and were not subjected to gender analysis using existing tools such as 
HGDG. 

10.6 The Table 32 below is the excerpt from the GPB pertaining to the subject GAD 
activities.

10.7 During the validation of the programs, the Audit Team found out that the attribution 
of the cost of the two aforementioned GAD activities were not subjected to gender 
analysis using existing tools such as HGDG.  The Audit Team’s interview with the 
GAD personnel revealed that although they had already attended the training 
workshop on the use and application of HGDG, they were not able to apply the 
gender analysis tool during the preparation of the GPB due to lack of planning and 
coordination with the officers in charge of the said projects.  

 
10.8 The HGDG tool is used to ensure that programs and projects undertaken by the 

government in their various stages are gender responsive.  Likewise, the tool aims 
to help the agency determine how much a program or project’s budget can be 
attributed to GAD.  The non-application of the HGDG tool did not ensure that the 
different concerns of men and women in BiPSU are addressed equally and 
equitably in their projects/programs. 

 

10.9 We recommended that henceforth the President ensure that the Gender and 
Development (GAD) Focal Point System and other personnel concerned: 

 

3) allocate in the annual GPB at least five percent of the total appropriation 

as required; and 
 

4) attribute to GAD costs, a portion or the whole of the University’s major 

programs activities and projects using HGDG tool to identify and confirm 

that they are responsive to the University’s existing gender issues. 
 

10.10 In the written reply to the AOM, the GAD Director and the GAD Vice Chairperson, 
GFPS reasoned out that the Budget for the GAD Programs in the GPB was below 
the requirement of at least 5% of the total appropriations because the GAD Focal 
Point System members (GFPS) failed to attribute most of the major programs and 
projects of the University.  They admitted that they still need to capacitate on gender 
mainstreaming using existing tools like HGDG to perform gender analysis. 
 

10.11 Likewise, they stated that the GFPS is not fully involve in the design, planning, 
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of some University programs and 



 

83 
 

projects that  may come from the capital outlay which hinders them to be aware of 
the major PAPs  of the University where mainstreaming gender perspective may be 
applied. 

 
10.12  Lastly, the University committed thru the GFPS officers to extend more efforts in 

Gender Mainstreaming utilizing the GAD Budget while adhering to the provisions 
of the Joint Circular No. 2012-01 of PCW-NEDA-DBM.

Collecting Officer account as of 
audit date due to the total 
variance of P1,032,328.75 
between the cashbook balances 
and the accounting balances 
caused by the following: a) lack 
of periodic reconciliation 
between the balances in the 
Accountable Officer’s (AO) 
cashbook and in the accounting 
records; b) unrecorded and/or 
erroneous recording of 
transactions in the books; and c) 
failure of the AO to rectify the 
erroneous deposits made to 
other funds of the University, 
contrary to Sections 110 and 111 
of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 
1445 and Section 6.3 of COA 
Circular No. 97-002. 
 
We recommend that the

Receivable year-end balance of 
BIPSU Main Campus totaling

to the following: a) variance of 
P237, 680.44 between the

of the Accounts Receivable 
between the GL and the SAR to 
ensure reliability and faithful 
representation of the reported 
balances; and 
 
 
8) Update the form used in

5. The accuracy and 
reliability of the Advances for 
Payroll account with a year-end 
balance of P9,814,782.77 was 
doubtful in view of the: 1) 
variance of P2,005.00 between 
the balances in the subsidiary 
records and in the Financial 
Statements; and 2) unrecorded 
liquidations and accounting 
errors which resulted in the 
overstatement of the account 
amounting to P2,623, 750.00, as 
well as understatement of the 
related expense accounts and 
Accumulated Surplus/Deficit, 
thus affecting the fair 
presentation of the financial 
statements. Moreover, cash 
advances for payroll totaling 
P7,189,027.77 remained 
unliquidated as of December 31, 
2019, contrary to COA 
Accounting Circular No. 2006-
001 and COA Circular No. 97-
002, thereby exposing 
government funds to risk of loss 
or misuse. 
 
We recommend that the 
University President require the 
Accountant to:  
 
10) promptly and accurately 
record the liquidation reports and 
other financial transactions in the 
books; 
 
11)  reconcile the P2,005.00 
variance between the balances in 
the subsidiary records and in the 
Financial Statements;

necessary adjusting/correcting 
entries of the reconciled amount, 
as well as the unrecorded 
liquidations and erroneous 
accounting entries in order that 
the correct balance of the 
Advances for Payroll shall be 
reflected in the books.

6. The reliability and

amounting to  
P6,676,151.36 and                 
P9,335,364.82, respectively, 
cannot be ascertained due to the 
absence of separate and complete 
accounting records for these 
Trsut Funds at BiPSU Biliran 
Campus in CYs 2008 to 2011 and 
to other deficiencies noted and/or 
errors in the books of BiPSU 
Main Campus. Likewise, the use 
of the trust funds, from SAFE 
Loan Program, for the 
maintenance and other operating 
expenses of the poultry and 
fishpond projects totaling 
P305,737.75 in CYs 2011 to 2013

noted, contrary to the guidelines 
governing the administration of 
the funds.

by the erroneous adjustment in 
order to arrive at the correct

18.   Liquidated damages were 
not collected from the five 
infrastructure projects of NSU-
Main Campus which incurred 
delay in the implementation 
while the 15% mobilization fee 
and 10% retention money were 
not deducted from some progress 
payments to contractors, contrary

tenth (1/10) of one (1) percent of 
the cost of the unperformed 
portion of the works for every 
day of delay on the defaulting 
contractor pursuant to Annex E. 
8.1 of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 
9184; and other appropriate 
sanctions to defaulting 
contractors, if warranted, in 
addition to liquidated damages; 
 
40) require the Accountant 
to prepare an adjusting entry to 
correct the erroneous recording 
of the transactions on Advances 
to Contractors and other 
accounts.

20.  The FY 2018 Gender and 
Development (GAD) 
Accomplishment Report (AR) 
showed that programs, activities 
and projects (PAPs) identified in 
the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) 
for FY 2018 were either not 
implemented or not fully 
implemented as of year end, and 
did not attribute to GAD cost, a 
portion or the whole of the 
University’s major programs and 
projects using Harmonized 
Gender and Development 
Guidelines (HGDG) tool. 

 
We recommended that the 
President require the GAD Focal 
Point System and other 
personnel concerned to: 

 
42) ensure that GAD PAPs 
are implemented as planned to 
attain the GAD objectives; 
 
43) attribute to GAD cost, a 
portion or the whole of the 
University’s major programs and 
projects using HGDG tools to 
identify and confirm that the 
PAPs are responsive to the 
University’s existing gender 
issues pursuant to PCW-NEDA-

21.      Management failed to 
remit taxes withheld totaling 
P7,894,270.69 as of December 
31, 2018 contrary to R.A. No. 
8424 or the National Internal 
Revenue Code of 1997, BIR 
Revenue Memorandum Circular 
No. 23-2012. Moreover, the 
accuracy of the year-end balance 
was not ascertained because 
withheld taxes from various 
employees and 
suppliers/contractors and the 
corresponding remittances were 
not adequately documented and 
Subsidiary Ledgers were not 
maintained which resulted in 
difficulty in the reconciliation of 
remittances and actual amounts 
of taxes withheld. 
 
We recommended that the 
President require the 
Accountant to: 

 
45) remit immediately all 
unremitted withheld taxes to the 
BIR; and henceforth, strictly 
comply with the provisions of 
BIR Revenue Memorandum 
Circular No. 23-2012 dated 
February 14, 2012; and

ledgers for the Due to BIR 
account to facilitate monitoring 
and reconciliation of accounts.

23.  The accuracy of the 
Accounts Receivable balance of 
P24,687,618.34 as of December 
31, 2017 is doubtful due to 
unrecorded assessed school fees 
totaling P39,048,696.84 and 
existence of variances in 
balances totaling P28,161,505.65 
between the General Ledger 
(GL) and the Schedule of 
Accounts Receivable as of year 
end, contrary to Section 111 of 
P.D. No. 1445, COA Circular 
Letter No. 2004-002 dated 
September 30, 2004, and 
pertinent provisions of the GAM 
for NGAs, Volumes I and III. 
 
We recommended that the OIC 
University President require the 
Accountant and Bookkeeper 
concerned to: 
 
49) reconcile their records 
to determine the cause/s of the 
variances totaling 
P28,163,819.21 and to make the 
necessary 
adjustments/corrections in their 
respective books of accounts 
including the un-booked 
receivables from school fees to 
come up with a correct account 
balance.

24.    The accuracy of the year-
end balance of the Property, Plant 
and Equipment (PPE) account at 
gross cost of P287,851,294.56 as 
of December 31, 2017 could not 
be ascertained due to the 
following: a) discrepancy in 
balances between the Financial 
Statements and submitted Report 
on the Physical Count of 
Property, Plant and Equipment 
(RPCPPE), b) incomplete/ 
inadequate information in the 
RPCPPE rendering it difficult to 
reconcile with property records,  
c) non-conduct of reconciliation 
between property records 
maintained by the Accounting 
and Supply Offices; and d) 
inclusion of unserviceable 
properties valued at P374,117.00 
of the Biliran Campus. 
 

We recommended that the OIC-
President require: 
 
50) the Accounting and the 
Supply Offices to reconcile their 
respective property records to 
ascertain that all PPEs are duly 
accounted for, to make the 
necessary adjustments in both 
records to come up with correct 
account balances, and 
henceforth, to regularly conduct 
monthly or quarterly 
reconciliation of their records; 
and 
 
51) the Supply Office to 
provide a copy of the IIRUP

specifically contains expenses 
that CAN or CANNOT be

Moreover, the CY 2017 reported 
accomplishments from GAD-
related activities amounting only 
to P271,350.00 was very much 
below the required 5% or 
P12,560.700.00 of NSU’s total 
budget of P251,214,000.00, 
partly due to failure in 
considering all costs attributable 
to the GAD budget, thus, 
deprived its targeted recipients of 
the best possible benefits of the 
Program.

29.  Out of the P5,771,911.36 
receivables due from students 
that had availed of the Student 
Assistance Fund for Education

only P46,730.00 or 0.81% was

an outstanding balance of 
P5,725,181.36, thereby depriving 
the other deserving and qualified 
students of the benefits that could 
be derived therefrom. Further, 
the said receivables were 
erroneously classified as 
Accounts Receivable instead of 
the Loans Receivable account. 
 
We recommended that the

days to more than 2 years which 
is equal to 46% of the total 
outstanding receivables; and (c) 
absence of records relative to the 
long outstanding cash advances. 
 
57) We recommended that the 
University President require the 
Accountant to exhaustively 
locate these payees with long 
outstanding Cash Advances and 
send Demand Letters to them and 
likewise, to all personnel 
concerned.  Otherwise, cause the 
withholding of salary of those in

32. Taxes withheld from 
compensation of employees and 
from payments to 
contractors/suppliers has 
accumulated to P3,922,436.94 as 
of December 31, 2015 due to:  (1) 
the failure to reconcile the 
monthly remittances with the 
actual amounts of taxes withheld 
per month, (2) failure to remit 
taxes withheld in the previous 
year(s), and (3) erroneous/non-

Accountant to (1) immediately 
conduct a detailed review of the 
transactions affecting taxes 
withheld and remitted to BIR to 
ascertain the correctness of the 
balances and details of the 
unremitted balance; (2) remit

warranted, 4) ensure that all taxes 
withheld for the month are 
remitted intact pursuant to
