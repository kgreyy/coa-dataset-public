Executive Summary



A. Introduction 

	

The Philippine Center for Postharvest Development and Mechanization (PHilMech) was formerly known as the National Postharvest Institute for Research and Extension (NAPHIRE). It was created by virtue of P.D. No. 1380 on May 24, 1978 to spearhead the development of the country’s postharvest industry. Subsequently, it was renamed as the Bureau of Postharvest Research and Extension (BPRE) and became a bureau of the Department of Agriculture (DA) as mandated by Executive Order 494. Pursuant to Executive Order (EO) No. 366, the Rationalization Plan (RP) of the BPRE was approved on November 5, 2009, and renamed the Agency again as the Philippine Center for Postharvest Development and Mechanization to reflect its new/additional mandate.



The new mandate of PHilMech is to generate, extend and commercialize appropriate and problem-oriented agriculture and fishery postharvest and mechanization technologies.  The mission is to empower the agriculture and fishery sector by increasing efficiency and productivity, reducing losses and adding value to the produce through research, development and extension.

	   

For CY 2020, PHilMech had a total workforce of 116 permanent employees headed by Dr. Baldwin G. Jallorina, as Executive Director, with the able assistance of the Director III Raul R. Paz. The organization has 11 divisions, namely: the Finance Division; Administrative Division; Planning, Management and Information Technology Division; Laboratory Services Division; Technology Management and Training Division; Applied Communication Division; Socioeconomic and Policy Research Division; Agricultural Mechanization Division; Bio-Process Engineering Division; Food Protection Division, and Enterprise Development Division.

D. Independent Auditor’s Report

            

As discussed in Part II of this Report, accounting errors and lapses amounting to ₱208,954,343.76 affected the fairness of presentation of the Property, Plant and Equipment accounts in the financial statements, itemized as follows: (a) non-derecognition of 267 units of farm machineries costing ₱208,675,132.00 already distributed to farmers’ cooperatives and associations; (b) recorded PPE items totaling to ₱716,567.73 acquired through grants-in-aid funds not covered by deeds of donation; and (c) reduction of PPE account balances by ₱437,355.97 as a consequence of negative balances in some PPE items.  In addition, Accounts Payable and Accumulated Surplus (Deficit) were misstated by ₱96,822,652.92 corresponding to payables recognized for procured items and services not yet delivered or rendered as of December 31, 2020. 



 In view of the foregoing, we recommended and the Executive Director agreed to undertake the following courses of action:



--	On Property, Plant and Equipment accounts



a)	Facility Management and Field Operations Division to fast track the processing of Deeds of Donation (DODs) and submit a copy of the same to the Property and Accounting Units;

 

b)	Accounting and Property Units to (i) derecognize in their respective records the distributed farm machineries amounting to ₱208,675,132.00 covered by duly executed DODs; and (ii) facilitate the request for transfer of ownership over PPE items totaling to ₱716,567.73 purchased through PCAARRD-GIA funded projects by securing Invoice Receipt/s for Property (IRP) or DODs from the PCAARRD; 



c)	Accounting Unit to draw the necessary adjusting entries in the books of accounts for PPE items with negative balances amounting to ₱437,355.97; and 



--	On Accounts Payable and Accumulated Surplus (Deficit)



d)	Stop the practice of recognizing Accounts Payable for procurements without actual receipt of goods or rendition of services following the accrual basis of accounting.





	E. Summary of Other Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



Summarized below are the other significant audit observations with their recommendations, the details of which are presented in Part II of this report. 



1)		Out of the previous year’s unliquidated balances for Intra-Agency Receivables accounts amounting to ₱49,944,165.17, a total of ₱4,276,454.59 was refunded in Calendar Year 2020 while an aggregate amount of ₱45,667,710.58, composed of receivables from different national and local government agencies, remained outstanding for over one year to more than three years, in spite of lapsed contract period contrary to the stipulations in their respective Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). Moreover, the failure to coordinate or send Notices to Liquidate (NL) to other three implementing agencies with unliquidated balances totaling to ₱7,491,504.33 had further cast doubts on the reliability and validity of the accounts as at year-end. (Audit Observation No. 3)

	

		We recommended and the Executive Director agreed to instruct the Finance Division Chief to (a) coordinate with the counterpart Accountant of all the IAs concerned for the immediate submission of liquidation reports pertaining to the utilized funds; (b) strengthen the monitoring controls on fund transfers to prevent accumulation of long outstanding fund transfers; (c) continue to issue demand letters/Notices to Liquidate to other IAs concerned on a regular basis; and (d) exert more diligent effort to determine the office or proper authority to coordinate with in relation to the NABCOR’s unsettled accounts  in order for the Agency to fulfill its own financial obligation due to the DA.



2)	The amount of ₱8,203,497.00 representing excess proceeds from the sale of bid documents and collection of protest fees during the previous and current years, were not remitted to the National Treasury even if the intended purpose has already been served inconsistent with Item 6.2 of the Budget Circular (BC) No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005, as amended by Budget Circular No. 2007-3 dated November 29, 2007. (Audit Observation No. 4)



				We recommended and the Executive Director agreed to instruct the Finance Division to immediately remit to the National Treasury the excess proceeds from sale of bid documents and protest fee after all claims for honoraria of the Chair/members of the BAC and TWG are settled in compliance with DBM Circular No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005, as amended by Budget Circular No. 2007-3 dated November 29, 2007.



3)	The expired portion of the Other Prepayments account totaling to ₱1,062,999.97 was not recognized/adjusted in the Agency’s books of accounts contrary to Section 53, Chapter 19, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), thus, overstating the Other Prepayments and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts by ₱1,062,999.97 and ₱284,196.77, respectively. Inversely, Property, Plant and Equipment, Intangible Assets, and Inventories were understated by ₱532,818.20, ₱165,840.00 and ₱80,145.00, respectively. (Audit Observation No. 6)



				We recommended and the Executive Director agreed to instruct the (a) Finance Division to (i) prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the misstatement of affected accounts totaling to ₱1,062,999.97; and (ii) ensure the timely preparation of journal entry voucher (JEV) to recognize the expired portion of the Prepayments account; (b) Chief of Administrative Division to direct the (i) Property Unit to ensure the preparation of IAR for all items delivered and forward the same to the Accounting Unit for recording; (ii) Procurement Section to (i) adopt the accrual basis of accounting to make sure that expenses are taken up in the proper accounting period; and (ii) inform canvassers to turn over to the Property Unit all goods delivered or services rendered by suppliers for immediate preparation of the IAR. 



4)	Disbursement vouchers (DVs) and liquidation reports (LRs) totaling to ₱175,702,016.19 were not submitted within the prescribed period with immeasurable delays ranging from two to 243 days. Moreover, reports of disbursements with an aggregate amount of ₱117,301,354.09 covering the period August to December 2020 remained unsubmitted which practice was not in keeping with Sections 7.1.1 and 7.2.1 of the COA 2009 Revised Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA); thus, Management was deprived of timely inputs on improvement opportunities and regulatory issues that may be determined upon prompt review of the accounts. (Audit Observation No. 7)

		

				We recommended and the Executive Director agreed to instruct the Finance Division to (a) observe compliance with the guidelines set forth under Sections 7.1.1 and 7.2.1 of COA 2009 Revised Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) to ensure the timely submission of accounts; (b) make realistic assessment of the workload of Accounting staffs involved in the processing of transaction documents based on the CY 2019 data, and the expected increase due to the implementation of RCEF in CY 2021; and (c) consider the placement or hiring of additional personnel based on the assessment of workload, if warranted.



5)	The CY 2020 GAD budget totaling to ₱17,050,356.63 or 5.32% of the Agency’s total annual appropriation of ₱320,264,149.00 was not covered by a GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) duly endorsed by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) for the reason that some project implementers failed to provide the required project documents and utilize the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) tool in the attribution of Research and Development (R & D) activities. Nevertheless, the Agency was still able to implement GAD programs, activities and projects (PAPs) which addressed the agency’s gender issues and concerns. (Audit Observation No. 9)



				We recommended and the Executive Director agreed to advise the GAD officials concerned to (a) enjoin project implementers to (i) provide project documents as relevant means of verification in the attribution of Research and Development (R&D) activities to GAD; (ii) accomplish Box 8 or the GAD Checklist for designing and evaluating agricultural and agrarian reform projects during the crafting of their project proposals; and (iii) subject all R&D activities to the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) assessment tool; (b) ensure timely submission of the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW)-endorsed GAD Plan and Budget (GPB); and (c) furnish the Audit Team with a copy of the PCW-endorsed GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) after approval by the Agency Head.



6)	The performance targets during the initial and second year implementation of the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Program (RCEP) were substantially achieved except for lapses noted such as a) late deliveries of 3,503 units of farm machineries and equipment to the Farmers and Cooperatives Association (FCA) beneficiaries; and b) failure to conduct required trainings to 680 FCA-beneficiaries out of the target number of 1,860 hindering the prompt turnover of the farm machineries/equipment.  Moreover, planning targets for different activities were not coordinated with the other implementing Divisions/Units concerned; thus, plans were not harmonized with the desired manner of execution and outputs, resulting in unrealistic projections. (Audit Observation No. 10)



					We recommended and the Executive Director agreed to undertake the following courses of actions:



a)	Instruct (i) the Division concerned to follow up with suppliers the undelivered units and fast track the distribution to the FCA beneficiaries; (ii) the implementing Divisions/Units to closely coordinate in the planning/determination of targets and regular monitoring of outputs to enable management in assessing the performance of the Program in a more effective manner, and (iii) the Division concerned to catch up with the remaining batches of Operator’s Training not yet conducted; and

b)	Direct all offices concerned to continue their commitment in the achievement of the objectives of the Program for the ensuing years 2021-2024.

	The other audit observations, together with the recommended courses of action, are discussed in detail in Part II of the report. These, along with the prior year’s recommendations not yet or partially acted upon and included in Part III of the report, were discussed with the officials and staff of the Agency.
