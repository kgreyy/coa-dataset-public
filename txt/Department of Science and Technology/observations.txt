PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

A. Accounting Errors and Omissions 
 

1. The asset, liability and equity accounts of the Department of Science and  
Technology (DOST) had errors and omissions misstating their year-end balances by 

₱341.566 million, ₱16.171 million, and ₱281.390 million, respectively, which 

represent 2.12 percent, 1.56 percent and 1.87 percent of said account groups. Due to 

the significant impact of such misstatements on the reported balances of the affected 

accounts, Management’s assertions as to the accuracy, existence, completeness, and 

classification of the said accounts could not be relied upon. 
 

2. Paragraph 15 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 
and Section 3, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, states 

that “Financial statements are a structured representation of the financial position and 

financial performance of an entity. The objectives of general-purpose financial statements 

are to provide information about the financial position, financial performance and cash 

flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making and evaluating decisions 

about the allocation of resources.” The standards further states that specifically, the 

objectives of the general-purpose financial reporting in the public sector should be to 

provide information useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the accountability of 

the entity for the resources entrusted to it. 

 

3. When an audited entity presents its FSs, it is implicitly making assertions that 
certain conditions have been fulfilled in the accounts, among others, which are as follows: 

 
Assertion Condition 

Completeness All transactions and events that should be recorded have been recorded 

Accuracy 
All transactions and events were recorded without error; all information disclosed is in the 
correct amounts and which reflect their proper values 

Cut-off All transactions and events were recorded within the correct reporting period 

Classification 
All transactions have been recorded in the proper accounts; assets, liabilities and equity 
interests have been recorded in the proper accounts 

Existence All account balances exist for assets, liabilities, and equity 

Rights and 
obligations 

The entity holds or controls the rights to assets, and liabilities are the obligations of the 
entity 

Valuation and 
allocation 

Assets, liabilities, and equity interests have been included in the financial statements at 
appropriate amounts and any resulting valuation or allocation adjustments have been 
appropriately recorded 

Presentation 
For account balances - assets, liabilities and equity interests are appropriately aggregated or 
disaggregated and clearly described, and related disclosures are relevant and 
understandable in the context of the requirements of the applicable financial reporting 

Understandability 
The information included in the financial statements has been appropriately presented 
and is clearly understandable. 

 



38 

 

4. The responsibility for the fair presentation and reliability of the FSs rests with the 
Management of the reporting entity, particularly the Head of Finance/Accounting Office 

and the head of entity or his authorized representative, as provided on IPSAS I and Section 

4, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I. 

 

5. Audit revealed several accounting errors/omissions resulting in misstatements in 
account balances reported in the financial statements of the DOST as summarized below:

7. The above-cited errors and omissions in recording and reporting of financial 
transactions were mainly due to: 

 

a. failure of the Accountants to observe highest degree of objectivity and consistency 
in the keeping of the accounts, and to carefully analyze transactions in order to 

apply appropriate policies on financial reporting; 

 



45 

 

b. lack of coordination and linkages with other offices or process owners for the 
submission of documents to support the recording of transactions in the books of 

accounts; and 

 

c. inadequate review and monitoring by the concerned Officers such that transactions 
were not correctly and timely reported. 

 

8. The above-cited errors and omissions resulted in transactions not accurately and 
timely recorded, not properly supported with required documents, and pertinent rules and 

policies not consistently applied, thus, leading to inaccurate financial information and 

affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements. 

 

9. We recommended and Management agreed to enjoin the DOST CAR, I, II, IV-
A, IV-B, V, VI, VII, X, XII and XIII Regional Directors to: 

 

a. require the Regional Accountants to: (i) make the necessary 
adjusting/correcting entries for the accounts affected by erroneous recordings 

in the books of accounts; (ii) observe the highest degree of objectivity and 

consistency in the keeping of the accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or 

misleading information; and (iii) carefully analyze the transactions prior to 

recording to ensure proper classification of accounts and accurate recording 

of financial transactions; and 

 

b. establish close coordination and strengthen linkages among concerned Offices 
to ensure timely submission of reports as basis of the Regional Accountants in 

the recording of transactions. 

 

B. Accounting Deficiencies 
 

10. The account balances of various asset and liability accounts with total value of 
₱893.826 million and ₱254.637 million, respectively, as at 31 December 2020, 

remained unaccounted due to deficiencies in the keeping of the accounts and the 

unavailability of sufficient documentary support thereto, thus, negatively affecting 

Management’s assertions on the existence, accuracy, rights/obligations, and 

completeness of the reported account balances in the FSs. 

  

11. We have noted accounting deficiencies which affected the reported balances of the 
accounts in the financial statements, as presented in Table 3:

12. In summary, the Agency’s Cash, Receivables, Inventories, PPE, Other Assets and 
Other Prepayments accounts have misstatements totaling ₱341.566 million representing 

2.12 percent of its total assets, while Inter-agency Payables and Trust Liabilities have 

misstatements of ₱16.171 million or 1.56 percent of the total reported Liabilities, and 

Accumulated Surplus/ (Deficit) account have misstatements of ₱281.390 million or 1.87 

percent of the total equity of the Agency as at 31 December 2020. Moreover, reported 

deficiencies totaling ₱1.148 billion also affected the Management assertions on the 

accuracy and completeness of the said accounts. Due to the significant impact of such 

misstatements and deficiencies, we rendered a Qualified Opinion on the financial

to for CY 2020, as shown in the following lapses: 

 

a. Lapses in Cash Advances (CAs) and Petty Cash Fund (PCF) Management 

 

14. The maintenance of DOST IV-A, XI and XII of PCF and of CAs for operating 
expenses has lapses in the granting, utilization, and liquidation by Accountable 

Officers (AOs), which resulted in the accumulation of the affected accounts’ balances, 

summarized in Table 4.

CAs in DOST IV-A were granted to AOs with previous unliquidated CAs, and the covering 

liquidation reports (LRs) for the last quarter of CY 2020 were not submitted as at 08 March  

2021. Likewise, DOST XII LRs were not submitted as at 9 February 2021 by AOs despite 

the fulfillment of the CAs’ purpose/s. 

 

b. Excess Cash in Bank, Local Currency Current Account (LCCA) not remitted to BTr 
 

16. The Cash in Bank, LCCA of seven Offices included funds downloaded from the 
appropriations of the DOST-SEI for the Science & Technology scholarship program, 

with a total balance of ₱207,807,664.62, and unnecessary project funds of 

₱8,090,887.61 which have been inactive for a period of three (3) to more than five (5) 

years. Moreover, the purposes for which the funds were established had been 

attained, but the same were not remitted to the National Treasury.  

 

17. Executive Order (EO) No. 431 dated 30 May 2005, and Section 10 of the General 
Provisions of the General Appropriations Act, FY 2020, provided that Departments, 

bureaus, offices, and instrumentalities of the National Government, including 

Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs are mandated to close and 

revert all balances of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust Funds, and other revolving 

funds to the General Fund in any of the following instances: (i) when there is no legal basis 

for its creation; (ii) when their terms have expired; or (iii) when they are no longer 

necessary for the attainment of the purpose for which said funds were established. 

 

18. Section 2, EO No. 338 dated 17 May 1996 also provides, “All government offices 
and agencies are hereby required to immediately transfer all public monies deposited with 

depository banks and other institutions to the Bureau of Treasury, regardless of income 

source.” 

 

i. Non-reversion of unutilized funds for scholarship  
 

19. Section 4 of Republic Act No.7687 created the Science and Technology (S&T) 
Scholarship Fund to provide scholarship grants to deserving students whose families’ 



55 

 

annual gross income do not exceed the poverty threshold limit for them to pursue courses 

in the field of science, mathematics, and engineering. 

 

20. Scholarship funds were granted to DOST ROs through Notices of Cash Allocation 
from the appropriations of the DOST-SEI. The said funds are maintained in the ROs’ 

respective LBP accounts and recorded under their Cash-in-Bank, LCCA and Due to NGAs 

accounts. The status of the said grants in CYs 2018 to 2020 are presented in Table 5.

Total 190,764,248.83 207,807,664.62   

 

21. Based on the preceding Table, it can be gleaned that the unexpended portion of the 
fund at the end of each year had accumulated in the Cash-in-Bank, LCCA and prior years 

(PYs) balances were neither returned to DOST-SEI nor remitted to the Bureau of the 

Treasury (BTr), but instead utilized to fund current year grants, contrary to the above-

mentioned guidelines.  

 

22. Since the program started, the DOST-SEI allowed the ROs to retain the unutilized 
funds at year-end to form part of the succeeding year’s budget. For CY 2020, the DOST-

SEI Director issued a Memorandum dated 05 January 2020, authorizing DOST ROs as 

implementing agencies (IAs), to utilize the remaining funds in contravention of Section 28, 



56 

 

Chapter IV of Book VI of the Administrative Code of 1987 (EO No. 292) which states that 

the unexpended balances of appropriations authorized in the General Appropriations Act 

shall revert to the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund at the end of the fiscal year 

and shall not thereafter be available for expenditure except by subsequent legislative 

enactment.  

 

23. However, since the fund transfers for the S&T Scholarship Fund were part of the 
annual appropriations of the DOST-SEI, the unexpended portion of the fund which had 

accumulated in the cash in bank account of DOST ROs also represented an unexpended 

portion of the DOST-SEI’s appropriations, which should have already reverted to the 

National Treasury in the absence of any legislative enactment, as provided in the above-

mentioned EO. Further, since the purpose of the PYs appropriations on the grant of 

educational assistance had been served and the succeeding year’s expenses are also covered 

by a yearly appropriation of the DOST-SEI, the retention of the unexpended portion of the 

funds is deemed unnecessary.  

 

24. With reference to CY 2019 and 2020 DOST IVB financial reports, the unexpended 
balances were ₱7,388,176.30 and ₱4,117,552.87, respectively. In the project financial 

report as at 31 December 2020, the utilization of pertinent line-items exceeded its budget. 

These were without express approval from the SA, primarily because each LIB of receipts 

was not supported with the lists of recipient scholars and the covering educational 

assistance, exposing the government funds to misuse and misappropriation. 

 

25. On the other hand, the authority of the DOST XI in the opening and maintenance of 
its current accounts with the LBP, particularly Account No. 2562-0030-05, was sought 

from the BTr in a request for confirmation from the Office of the Regional Supervising 

Auditor dated 18 February 2021. The BTr Officer-in-Charge, confirmed that there is no 

available records providing clearance/authority to the DOST RO XI in the opening and 

maintenance of the aforementioned current accounts. 

 

26. Moreover, DOST XI Management was reminded of Item b of Section 63, Chapter 
6 of the GAM, Volume 1, which provides that “The fund to be transferred or sub-allotted 

to the IA shall be a) in an amount sufficient for three months operation subject to 

replenishment upon submission of the reports of disbursements by the IA, or b) the total 

project cost, as may be determined by the Heads of the two agencies in either case.” 

Nonetheless, the Audit Team was not provided with information, not even on the total 

project costs translated into the number of scholars with the corresponding educational 

grants, as determined by the Heads of the two agencies, the DOST XI and the DOST-SEI. 

 

ii. Inactive CIB- LCCA, Trust and testing fees collected without the covering 
authority to use not reverted/remitted to the National Treasury 

 

27. The CIB-LCCA account of the following Offices also included unexpended 
balances of completed projects and testing fees collected which the agency has no authority 

to use in the amount of ₱7,333,122.61 and ₱757,765.00, respectively, summarized in Table 

6:

28. Since all the projects/ activities were all completed, the cash in the bank is no longer 
needed by the Agencies and it is just proper to transfer the balance thereof to the general 

fund of the government pursuant to the above regulations. 

 

29. The continued retention of these enormous amount of idle funds precluded the 
opportunity for the National Treasury to maximize the use of scarce government resources 

by minimizing borrowings, rationalizing on cash management, and using these funds to 

finance its priority programs and expenditures; not to mention that the National 

Government is currently in need of additional funds to support our countrymen during this 

pandemic. 

 

30. We recommended and Management agreed to enjoin the concerned Regional 
Directors to: 

 

a. require the Regional Offices (ROs) Scholarship Units and the Accountants 
to expedite reconciliation and return/revert to the DOST-SEI or to the BTr 

the unexpended/unutilized scholarship funds. Henceforth, request 

authority from the BTr for the maintenance of the scholarship funds and 

ensure that all unexpended balances, upon serving the scholarship grant at 

the end of the year, are duly remitted to the DOST-SEI or to the BTr, so as 

to avoid accumulation of excess funds in the agency’s depository accounts; 

(DOST I, III, IV-B, V, VI, VIII and XI) 

 

b. coordinate with the respective State Universities and Colleges’ (SUCs) 
Office of the School Registrar, where the scholars are enrolled, for a timely 

submission of report cards (grades), similar to the procedures of DOST-SEI 

and UP-Diliman wherein the former’s personnel are granted limited access 

on grades of pertinent scholars; (DOST IV-B) 

 

c. henceforth, ensure that scholarship funds received shall be supported with 
trust agreement/s with the total project cost translated into the number of 

scholars with covering grants, as determined by the DOST-SEI and 

Regional Directors; (DOST IV-B and XI) 



58 

 

 

d. require the Project Managers to communicate and confirm with the source 
agencies the status of the funds granted for completed projects and to 

ensure that there are no remaining project funds due for liquidation and 

remit the same to the BTr; (DOST CO and I) and 

 

e. henceforth, require the Accountant to ensure that all collections regardless 
of income source should be duly remitted to the BTr. (DOST I) 

 

c. Long outstanding GIA Fund Transfers – Due from National Government Agencies 
(NGAs), Local Government Units (LGUs), Regional Offices (ROs), Non-Government 

Organizations/Peoples Organization/Civil Society Organizations (NGOs/POs/CSOs) and 

Other Receivables  

 

31. The failure of the Management to closely monitor and reconcile the utilization 
of  transferred funds and to strictly enforce the provisions of COA Circular Nos. 94-

013, 2016-005, and DOST-GIA Guidelines, on the submission of liquidation reports 

by IAs, resulted in ₱5,565,928,995.02 aggregate balance from completed projects that 

remained unliquidated for over ten years, particularly carried in the year-end 

balances of the accounts Due from (NGAs, LGUs, ROs, NGOs/PO/CSOs) and Other 

Receivables amounting to ₱9,457,839,111.58, ₱83,204,261.14, ₱1,168,373.00, 

₱136,544,957.53, and ₱859,197,515.95, respectively, as at 31 December 2020, thus 

casting doubt on the proper implementation of the projects and the timely delivery of 

the expected research outputs. 

 

32. Paragraph 4.6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated 31 December  1994 provides that 
within 10 days after the end of each month/ end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA 

shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to 

report the utilization of the funds. Paragraph 4.9 further states that the IA shall return to the 

SA any unused balance upon completion of the project while Paragraph 5.4 provides that 

the SA shall require the IA to submit the reports and furnish the IA with a copy of the JEV 

taking up the expenditures. 

 

33. COA Circular No. 2007-001 dated 05 October 2007, provides the guidelines on 
fund transfers to NGOs/POs; Section 5.4 thereof requires the submission of the Fund 

Utilization Report (FUR) and its supporting documents within 60 days after the completion 

of the project for the liquidation of the funds transferred. 

 

34. Section VIII Item 3.e of the Administrative Order (A.O) No. 009 dated 09 
November 2017 or the Revised DOST GIA Guidelines states that “for failure to submit the 

required financial, technical, and other reports within the prescribed deadlines, demand 

letter shall be sent to the Project Leader and Head of Agency”. Further, it states that the 

Funding Agency (FA) may undertake legal measures against the Project Leader for non-

submission of requirements. 

 



59 

 

35. COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated 19 December 2016, was issued to prescribe the 
guidelines and procedures in reconciling and cleaning the books of accounts of NGAs, 

LGUs, and GOCCs of dormant accounts, unliquidated CAs, and fund transfers for fair 

presentation of accounts in the FSs. 

 

36. The outstanding balance of fund transfers as at year-end amounted to 
₱10,537,954,219.20, classified as not yet due for liquidation aged at less than one (1) year 

and past due for over one (1) year with balances of ₱4,972,025,224.18 or 47.18 percent 

and ₱5,565,928,995.02 or 52.82 percent, respectively, details are shown in Table 7.

37. As can be gleaned from the above Table, total unliquidated FTs in the amount of 
₱5,565,928,995.02 or 52.82 percent remained outstanding from one (1) year to over 10 

years. Non-compliance of the IAs on the submission of Liquidation Reports (LRs) despite 

completion of the projects either through fulfilment of its objectives or lapse of the agreed 

timeframe, as well as repeated demand letters sent to the IAs, resulted in the accumulation 

of unliquidated fund transfers and the non-reporting of expenses incurred in the project 

implementation. This has been a perennial problem of DOST reiterated over the years in 

the Consolidated Annual Audit Reports. 

 

38. Out of the completed projects in DOST NCR of ₱21,096,809.92, 87 percent or 
₱18,429,809.92 were already past due and still outstanding in the books for over one to 10 

years. Moreover, outstanding receivables amounting to ₱12,461,267.25 from 22 delinquent 

SETUP beneficiaries with on-going projects as at year-end and who had been in default for 

at least 12 to over 48 months. Considering such length of time that had lapsed in the 

submission of liquidation reports to support the utilization of funds, the probability of 

liquidation is reduced specially those fund transfers with age of more than five years. The 

unliquidated fund transfers that remained outstanding in the books despite completion of 

its intended purposes indicates weak enforcement of liquidations among IAs as well as the 

monitoring of project implementation. 

 

39. In CY 2020, an allowance for impairment of Other Receivables in the amount of 
₱4,620,450.60 was recognized in the books of DOST NCR for the accounts of 11 

terminated SETUP projects which were endorsed to the Office of the Solicitor General 



60 

 

(OSG) for filing of cases to demand settlement of uncollected receivables. The said 

receivable balance was outstanding in the books for more than five years and remained 

uncollected, thus, considered dormant. 

 

40. Analysis of the receivable balances in DOST IV-B  per book vis-à-vis the reports on 
government programs/ projects/ activities (GPPAs) as of 31 December 2020, as well as the 

status reports of unliquidated CAs, fund transfers and other receivables  granted to various 

local government units LGUs, NGOs/POs, NGAs such as, but not limited to State 

Universities and Colleges (SUCs), and the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) 

for the implementation of the GIA program and SETUP, revealed that several fund 

transfers to the aforementioned organizations were excluded from the up-to-date 

monitoring reports. These incidents can be considered precedents of the inadequacy of 

technical and financial monitoring activities of the DOST IV-B in the management of its 

projects. 

 

41. In DOST II, the Due from NGOs/POs account balance of ₱4,500,667.58 included 
dormant FTs to 10 CSOs/POs which are already dissolved totaling to ₱638,781.08. The 

amounts remain unliquidated from nine (9) to 24 years is evident that close monitoring on 

utilization and liquidation of funds transferred was not properly conducted. On the other 

hand, records and documents of equipment sourced from the amount transferred in one 

recipient NGO could no longer be located to support the agency’s claim. Moreover, it was 

noted the agency was granting additional fund transfers despite partial/non-liquidation of 

previous fund transfers, which resulted in the accumulation of unliquidated balance in the 

amount of ₱38,486,026.79 under the receivable accounts.  

 

42. Among the deficiencies noted in both the DOST CO and the ROs that contributed 
to the accumulation of unliquidated FTs were the following: 

 

a. Management’s failure to closely monitor project implementation and reconcile 
the utilization and liquidation of funds transferred such that liquidation of even 

completed projects were not strictly enforced. 

 

b. Non-enforcement of the accountability aspect stipulated in the MOA, PD No. 
1445, COA Circular No. 94-013, COA Circular No. 2016-005, COA Circular 

No. 2007-001, COA Circular No. 2012-001 and DOST GIA Guidelines. 

 

43. Further, the DOST CO LIBs showed that several projects in the total amount of 
₱42,923,356.60 implemented by four (4) NGOs do not meet the required 20 percent 

counterpart funding with an average of only 14.25 percent equity. It must be noted that 

Section 2.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 and Section 4.5.4 of COA Circular No. 2007-

001 provide that the NGO shall have an equity equivalent to 20 percent of the total project 

cost which shall be in the form of labor, land for the project site, facilities, equipment, and 

the like, to be used in the project. 

 

44. The huge amount of the unliquidated FTs to different IAs of the DOST-CO and 
concerned ROs cast doubt on whether or not a certain project was actually implemented. 



61 

 

Strict compliance with the enumerated issuances/regulations thru regular monitoring of 

project implementations and reconciliation of receivable balances with IAs shall effectuate 

timely submission of LRs, timely return of unexpended budget that could have been used 

to fund other priority projects of the government and ultimate attainment of the project 

objectives/ research outputs.  

 

45. We reiterated our prior years’ recommendations and Management agreed to 
enjoin the concerned Regional Directors to enforce strict compliance with existing 

rules and regulations, as well as the provisions of the MOA with the IAs on the grant, 

utilization and liquidation of fund transfers by requiring the Project Leaders and 

Accountants to: 

 

a. ensure that all the project proponents complied with the requirements set 
forth under the DOST GIA Guidelines including the counterpart equity 

before approval of the proposals; (DOST CO, CAR, NCR, I, II, IV-B, VI, IX 

and X) 

 

b. henceforth, ensure commitment that the amount received by implementing 
partners will be translated into research project deliverables/outputs, only 

proposals with covering request for funding for itemized budget shall be 

approved and funded; (DOST CO, CAR, NCR, I, II, IV-B, VI, IX and X) 

 

c. send demand letters and impose legal sanctions to IAs with completed 
projects and outstanding account balances for immediate settlement of all 

unliquidated fund transfers thru submission of liquidation reports with 

adequate documentations and return of excess funds; (DOST IV-B)   

 

d. exert more effort to locate the whereabouts of the incorporators of the 
dissolved NGOs/CSOs/POs and consider endorsing IA accounts to OSG for 

filing of appropriate legal action for failure to settle/ refund their 

obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract 

agreement; (DOST II)  

 

e. conduct regular monitoring of project implementation and reconciliation of 
receivable accounts with the Accountants and Project Leaders of the 

Implementing Agencies (IAs) to effectuate regular/timely submission of 

LRs-Financial/Technical Reports and return of the unexpended balances 

not only to avoid accumulation of unliquidated account balances but also to 

facilitate the preparation by the Accountants of the covering Status Reports 

of the Unliquidated CAs, Fund Transfers, and Other Receivables; and 

(DOST CO, CAR, NCR, I, II, IV-B, VI, IX and X)  
 

f. ensure that no additional fund transfer is to be made unless the existing 
balance has been properly liquidated. (DOST II) 

 

 



62 

 

46. DOST IV-B Management commented that a memorandum on the monthly 
monitoring of GIA projects has been issued in July 2020 to strengthen the Agency’s 

monitoring system and increase the success rate of GIA projects from 2017-2019. This 

measure will be further expanded to cover all GIA projects as well as include the regular 

monitoring of all SETUP projects to ensure that the technical and financial reports are 

accurate and up to date and that appropriate and immediate actions will be taken for 

projects with delinquent beneficiaries and recipients. 

 

47. DOST II Management commented that they had already implemented the “no 
liquidation, no release” policy however, the policy had not been supportive to the 

advancement of S&T in SUCs and other partner agencies and to the financial activities of 

DOST II. It had slowed the plans they set for the year. They also commented that they have 

to release assistance to government agencies even if there were unliquidated funds since 

the transactions were anyway "government to government" of which DOST II is assured 

that funds are protected because they also have COA Auditors and because of the 

unforeseen situations brought by the pandemic. DOST II however, introduced new 

measures to accelerate submission of liquidation by closely coordinating with the project 

leader through virtual meetings to address concerns/problems encountered in the 

implementation and sharing with them the ledgers of the unliquidated funds to create 

consciousness and serve as a reminder of their obligation.  

 

48. DOST NCR Management commented that the financial reports of NGAs, LGUs 
and ROs duly received by COA are sufficient proof of liquidation from the IAs. 

Considering that the COA received the financial reports of IAs for audit, all documents of 

disbursement like receipts, invoices etc., have already been submitted by the IAs to the 

COA.  

 

49. As a rejoinder, the presentation of the Report of Checks Issued and Reports of 
Disbursement in compliance with COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated 14 June 2012 is a 

necessity in order to at least support the summary of expenditures presented in financial 

reports and recorded in the books of accounts of the NGAs/IAs. It is also an aid in the 

restatement of expenditures in the financial statements to appropriate accounting period. 

 

50. In addition, it must be emphasized that the provisions of DOST AO No. 11, series 
of 2020 dated 02 September 2020, in number 5, item C on Financial Monitoring on the 

guidelines for Non-Submission of Requirements, that; 

 

“For failure to submit the required financial, technical and other 

reports within the prescribed deadlines, a demand letter shall be sent 

to the Project Leader and Head of Agency. 

 

Upon the recommendation of the MA, the smallest unit of the 

Implementing Agency may be prevented from receiving further 

grants or any kind of support from any agency within the DOST 

System until he/she is cleared from all obligations pertinent to 

previous GIA grant received. For compelling reason, subject to 



63 

 

endorsement of the MA, the Project Leader shall submit an Oath of 

Undertaking to allow him/her to receive further grant or support. 

The FA may undertake legal measures against the Head of the 

Implementing Agency for non-submission of requirements.” 

 

51. The concluding statement of the above provisions is consistent with COA 
Memorandum No. 2017-010 dated 15 May 2017 which states that there is a need for the 

Accountant to issue a demand letter to the Accountable Officer (AO)/employee 

recipient/NGOs to liquidate their due and demandable cash advances/fund transfers, this 

may serve as a proof of exhaustion of all remedies to collect receivables and liquidate cash 

advances and fund transfers as basis for the issuance of the final demand letter of the Audit 

Team Leader in preparation for the filing of appropriate charges by the concerned COA 

Cluster Directors before the Office of the Ombudsman in case the AOs/recipient/NGO fail 

to comply therewith. In this case, the accumulation of unliquidated fund transfers can be 

minimized, if not totally avoided. 

 

d. Deficiencies in the implementation and collection or repayment for Small 
Enterprise Technology Upgrading Program (SETUP) recorded under the Other 

Receivable accounts  

 

52. The SETUP projects recorded under Other Receivables account in the amount 
of ₱1,805,133,847.69 as at year-end cannot be ascertained due to the (a) inability of 

the beneficiaries to pay the refunds; (b) unrecognized project refunds; (c) non-

recording of new beneficiary receivable and dishonored checks; and (d) laxity in the 

project implementation following the provisions of the MOA, hence, resulting in 

₱1,165,384,643.41 past due accounts for one (1) to over 10 years, ₱289,682,017.20 or 

32.42 percent of which were of doubtful collectability.   

 

53. Section 2 of PD 1445 provides that: “It is the declared policy of the State that all 
resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with 

law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper 

disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy, and effectiveness in the operations 

of the government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to 

rests directly with the chief or the head of the government agency concerned.” 

 

54. The SETUP is one of the flagship programs of DOST that encourages the Micro, 
Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) to adopt technological innovations to improve 

their operations, boost their productivity and competitiveness, increase their sales, 

streamline, and improve their overall company operations, and upgrade the quality of their 

products and services.   

 

55. The program provides financial and technical assistance to qualified MSMEs with 
the commitment to refund the cost of the innovation, where repayment is called a rental 

refund in which the MSME beneficiary is generally required to issue 36 post-dated checks 

(PDCs) and additional check for transfer fee. A refund is also included as part of the project 

proposal stating among others the dates and amount to be paid. 



64 

 

 

56. Section 8.e.2 on refund mechanism/ restructuring of the Revised SETUP guidelines 
provided under DOST Administrative Order (AO) No. 002 dated 12 January 2016 states 

that, “refund shall be for a period of three to five years depending on the nature of the 

project and financial capacity of the cooperator as recommended by the Review Technical 

Evaluation Committee (RTEC) subject to the approval of the Regional Program Director, 

National Program Director DOST-EXECOM where appropriate.” 

 

57. Monitoring of project implementation across regions shall be under the Office of 
the Undersecretary for Regional Operations. Each region shall set up a Regional Program 

Management Office (RPMO) headed by Regional Director. The RPMO shall ensure proper 

implementation of the program in the region consistent with the national guidelines and 

policies prescribed by the Steering Committee. 

   

58. Moreover, under the terms and conditions of the MOA, the ROs shall have the 
following duties and responsibilities: 

  

a. Facilitate the collection of the monthly refunds (rentals) of (cooperator) in 
accordance with the approved schedule of refunds (rentals) (made part hereof as 

Annex D) and remit the same to the Treasury. 

 

b. Facilitate pull out of all tools and equipment procured out of project funds and 
collect the whole amount equivalent to the financial assistance less value of pulled-

out equipment, and incurred penalties, if any, in the event that (cooperator) fails to 

remit refund (rental) for six (6) consecutive months or for any violation of the MOA 

entered into by the DOST-RO and cooperator. 

 

c. In case the (cooperator) fails to remit refund (rental) for six (6) consecutive months 
or violates any provision of the MOA entered into by the (beneficiary) with the 

DOST-RO, shall settle the final obligation to be computed in accordance with the 

formula presented in Annex C – “Computation of Final Obligation of Terminated 

Projects” of the SETUP Guidelines. 

 

59. DOST AO No. 002 further provides that the concerned DOST RO shall 
immediately post in the SETUP website the pulled – out equipment for information of all 

DOST ROs and Provincial S & T Centers (PSTC) who may have a need for similar 

equipment in their respective areas. It also requires that all pulled-out equipment shall be 

temporarily housed at the PSTC/RO or any secured facility which shall be made available 

to any SETUP cooperator who may have use for the equipment. 

 

60. The aging of receivables revealed an accumulated balance of SETUP projects 
recorded under the Other Receivables account amounting to ₱2,329,499,414.29 in 14 ROs, 

wherein ₱1,279,781,504.57 were already past due for almost one (1) to over 10 years, as 

summarized in Table 8:

There were also no established

SETUP accounts as well as the 
actions taken by the 
Management, like endorsements 
to the Office of the Solicitor 
General (OSG) and pull-outs of

The DOST IV-B Management agreed to 
instruct the: 

a. concerned Provincial Science and 
Technology Directors (PSTDs) to: 

i. compel respective project leaders to 
submit technical progress reports as 
well as the corresponding financial 
reports on a regular basis;

VI 17,080,901.50 Receivables had been 
outstanding since CY 2004 to 
2012, which remained 
uncollected due to the inability of 
the SETUP beneficiaries to pay

VIII 8,307,835.50 The grant of financial assistance 
to various cooperators of SETUP 
was not in conformity with the 
existing guidelines, due to: (a) in-
consistency between the 
guidelines and the Review and 
Technical Evaluation Committee

Office Observation Recommendation 

VII 

Other Receivables account – (SETUP) cannot be 
ascertained 
 
DOST VII actual SETUP refund receivable cannot 
be accurately established due to: (a) the assumed 
value of equipment is not updated; (b the payment 
period and amount is not disclosed; (c) reason for 
termination as well as the final termination value 
with penalties was not disclosed; and (d) the non-
inclusion of the .05% Technology Transfer Fee for 
Beneficiaries before 2019, thus, impedes the 
recognition, monitoring and collection of the scarce 
government funds. This defies Section 27 of the 
PPSAS 1 as reiterated in Section 7, Chapter 19, 
GAM, Volume I on the principle of fair presentation 
of balances in the Financial Statements. 

The DOST VII Management agreed to 
henceforth, require Accounting section 
and the SETUP Technical Management 
Team to periodically update and 
coordinate their records so that the SETUP 
refundable amount as well as recorded 
Other Receivable are presented with 
accurate, reliable, and timely amounts. 

IX 

Non-adherence to the MOA 
 
In DOST IX, some terms and conditions stipulated 
in the MOA entered into by and between the RO and 
recipients/proponents were not strictly complied 
before and after the release of financial assistance 
under the SETUP contrary to DBM Circular No. 
2018-14 dated 28 December 2018. 
 

The DOST IX Management agreed to 
require payees/recipients of the financial 
assistance of the SETUP to strictly abide 
and comply with all the terms and 
conditions of the MOA to avoid legal 
actions in the future.  We also 
recommended that the lacking original or 
certified true photocopy of the 
Acknowledgment Receipts (ARs) or ORs 



69 

 

Office Observation Recommendation 

Records showed that Acknowledgement Receipt 
(AR)/ Official Receipt (OR) were not among the 
documents submitted/attached to the DVs as proof 
that funds were received by the payees. Moreover, 
examination of the ORs or ARs submitted to the 
Audit Team showed that these were only 
photocopies and not certified as true photocopies 
from the original by the person who has the custody 
of the original documents. 

be submitted to the Audit Team for post-
audit. 

 

63. DOST IX Management commented that upon full withdrawal of the SETUP fund, 
the firms issue AR for the receipt of fund. Further, issuance of PDCs by the proprietor is 

already an acknowledgment that the funds were received.  

 

64. However, we maintain our audit recommendation as the objective of examining the 
evidence of receipt of payment is to establish that the fund disbursed had actually been 

received by the payee so that any liability arising from the claim has indeed been 

extinguished or reduced to the amount received by the payee. This purpose is not served 

by the neglect of concerned personnel in ensuring the attachment/ submission of ORs in 

several Disbursement Vouchers (DVs). 

 

e. Transferred Grant in Aid (GIA) funds not properly documented 
 

65. In DOST CO, the required documents for the transferred funds, were not 
completely submitted contrary to  COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated 14 June  2012 

and DOST AO No. 009 dated 09 November 2017, rendering the entitlement of 

NGAs/NGOs/CSOs/POs to government funds doubtful. 

 

66. The DOST, in partnership with other government and private institutions, provide 
financial assistance through the GIA Program to support research and development projects 

that will contribute significantly to national economic development of the country. The 

project shall be covered with MOA which embodies the terms and conditions between 

DOST as the SA and the NGAs/NGOs/CSOs and private institutions as IAs. A 

Technical/Financial Report and terminal Audited Financial Report shall be submitted in 

order to account the utilization of the grant. All funds provided for the projects are recorded 

under the account Due from NGAs, Due from NGO/CSOs and Other Receivables. 

 

67. COA Circular No. 94-013 dated 13 December 1994 provides the rules and 
regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to IAs.  This is to 

ensure that the transfer is properly taken up in the books of the SA and IA and used only 

for the intended purpose and that proper accounting and reporting is made on the utilization 

of the funds 

 

68. The incomplete documents submitted by project proponents required for a fund 
transfer as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated 14 June 2012, DOST AO 

No. 009 dated 09 November 2017 and the Revised DOST GIA Guidelines rendered IAs 

entitlement to government funds doubtful. 



70 

 

 

69. The AO No. 009 dated 09 November 2017, or the Revised DOST GIA Guidelines 
provides for the process of the GIA program from the proposal submission; review and 

approval; monitoring; and discontinuance of GIA assistance, among others. It articulates 

under Section VI, Item 2 the project proposal requirement and its supporting documents 

whereas, Section VIII, Items 2 and 3 provides the policies for Technical and Financial 

Monitoring of all the GIA projects. 

 

70. Verification of supporting documents on fund transfers showed that the following 
documents were either not submitted or deficient: 

 

Per COA Circular 2012-001, Section 3.1.1: 

 

 Copy of the official receipt issued by the Implementing Agency to the Source Agency 

acknowledging receipt of funds transferred 

 

Per DOST AO No. 009: 

 

 Project Proposal Requirements/Continuing Financial Assistance 

 Curriculum Vitae of project leader and other co-researchers/implementers; 

 Duly signed list of Inventory Report of Equipment; 

 Property Acknowledgement Receipt; 

 List of Personnel Involved in the project; 

 Endorsement of the MA with an Appraisal Report; 

 

71. Absence of the above documents prior to fund transfer is not only contrary to the 
above regulations but also casted doubt on the entitlement of the IAs to the government 

funds.   

 

72. We recommended and Management agreed to ensure that all the documentary 
requirements be submitted, and the procedure were complied with by the proponents 

before any fund transfer is approved.  

 

f. Non-conduct of physical count of Inventories 
 

73. The lack of periodic reconciliation between the Stock Cards (SCs) and 
Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs) maintained by the Property and Accounting Divisions, 

respectively, due to the non-conduct of physical count, not only resulted in reported 

difference of ₱1,018,994.18, but also raised doubt on the accuracy, reliability, and 

existence of all the inventories reported at year-end in the financial statements of 

DOST V. 

 

74. Appendix 58 of the GAM, Volume II prescribes the use of Stock Card (SC) which 
shall be used to record all receipts and issuances of supplies and the balance in quantity at 

any time. It shall be maintained by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit for each item 

in stock. The agency/entity shall conduct physical count of inventories every semester. The 



71 

 

semestral physical inventory of supplies shall be reconciled with the SLCs and controlling 

accounts and Supply and/or Property records. Any discrepancies shall be immediately 

verified and adjusted.  

 

75. The lack of periodic reconciliation of the SCs and SLCs maintained by the 
Accounting and Property Divisions resulted in material difference of ₱1,018,994.18 in 

Inventory account balances. Likewise, the non-conduct of physical count and the absence 

of the covering Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) raised doubt on the 

accuracy, reliability and existence of the inventories reported in the financial statements of 

DOST V. 

 

76. We recommended and DOST V Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Accounting and Property Divisions to conduct periodic reconciliation 
of their records, and thereafter, reconcile them with the result of the 

physical count through the RPCI to determine discrepancies for immediate 

adjustments to reflect the correct balances of the Inventory accounts; 

 

b. The Accountant to make the necessary adjustments; and 
 

c. The Property Division to conduct physical count not only on office supplies 
but also on all inventory items by type. 

 

g. Non-conduct of physical count of properties, non-disposal of unserviceable PPEs 
and delayed submission of reports 

 

77. The non-conduct of physical count of properties, non-preparation and non-
submission of RPCPPE for all PPE, non-disposal of unserviceable PPE with and 

without covering Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property 

(IIRUP), and the non-reconciliation, -maintenance and -updating of Property Cards 

and Property Acknowledgment Receipt (PAR), not only resulted in unreconciled 

differences between Accounting and Property records but also cast doubt to the 

completeness and existence of the PPE owned by DOST II, IV-B and XII in the 

amounts of ₱103,996,324.66,  ₱82,282,706.33 and ₱169,324,000.96, respectively as at 

year-end.  

 

78. In Section 38, Chapter 10, GAM, Volume I it is stated that “the entity shall have a 
periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report 

on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as of December 31 of 

each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of 

the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical 

count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording.” 

 

79. Section 42, Chapter 10, GAM, Volume I also requires that “Accounting and 
Property Records to be maintained for PPE. The Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPE 

Ledger Card (LC) for each category of PPE. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly 



72 

 

the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, 

disposal, and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and 

Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the 

receipt and disposition of the same, balance per PC shall be reconciled with other Property 

records like PAR.” 

 

80. During the year, the following Regional Offices failed to comply with the above 
provisions as shown by the deficiencies noted, which are summarized in Table 11: 

 
Table 11. Summary of Observations 

Office  PPE Balance in ₱ Observations 

II 103,996,324.66 

The submitted RPCPPE included only the accounts for Land, Land 
Improvements, Buildings and Other Structures, Office Equipment and Motor 
Vehicles totaling to ₱55,565,535.81 or 53% of the total PPE. The Team, 
consistently reminded the Supply Division to submit the RPCPPE for the other 
PPE accounts, however, as of this report, there was none received by this 
office. 

IV-B 82,282,706.33 
Unserviceable properties awaiting disposal with carrying amount of ₱.133 
million were not reported in the IIRUP due to: 

XII 169,324,000.96 

a. Non-conduct of physical count and delayed submission of RPCPPE; 
b. Unreconciled Property Cards and PPE Ledger Card for failure to update 

by the Property and Accounting Units, respectively; 
c. Non-renewal of PAR every three years every time there is a change in 

custodianship/user of the property; 
d. Unserviceable PPE with covering IIRUP amounting to ₱10,297,778.58 

with salvage value of ₱1,029,777.86 were not yet appraised and 
disposed. 

 

81. Thus, the completeness and existence of the recorded PPE could not be ascertained. 
These deficiencies manifested the inability of Management to efficiently manage its 

properties. 

  

82. We recommended and the DOST II, IV-B and XII Management agreed to: 
 

a. ensure proper coordination between the Regional Accountants and the 
Supply Property Officers on the conduct of reconciliation of the 

unreconciled amounts; 

 

b. require the Inventory Team to conduct periodic/annual physical count of 
PPE; prepare the covering RPCPPE of all PPE using the prescribed 

format and submit thereof not later than January 31 of the following 

year;  

 

c. enjoin the Supply Property Officer and Regional Accountants to prepare/ 
maintain/update the issuance of PAR, PC, PPELC, and IIRUP following 

the procedures of NBC No. 425 dated 28 January 1992 and in accordance 

with Section 40(d) of GAM ,Volume I ; and 

 



73 

 

d. require the Disposal Committee to conduct immediate appraisal of all 
unserviceable assets for disposal and together with the Property Unit to 

cause the immediate disposal of unserviceable assets covered by IIRUP to 

avoid further deterioration and to furnish the Regional Accountants  the 

necessary documents for de-recognition after disposal. 

 

h. Building and Land Improvements not owned by the Agency  
 

83. DOST XII Office Buildings and Land Improvements accounts amounting to 
₱147,385,176.36 and ₱950,000.00, respectively, were recorded under the PPE 

accounts; however, ownership of Land cannot be established due to the absence of a 

Torrens Title drawn in its favor, thus, affecting Management’s assertions on the 

presentation of the FS, including among others, ownership and proper valuation of 

assets acquired, thereby, absolute ownership of buildings constructed is doubtful. 

 

84. Section 11, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I states that “PPE acquired through 
a non-exchange transaction, such as donation, presidential proclamation, taxes, transfers 

and grants, its cost shall be measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition. 

However, this does not constitute revaluation.  If the fair value cannot be determined, the 

asset shall be recorded at a nominal value (the value that is stated on currency or face 

value).” 

 

85. The absolute proof of ownership of a land is evidenced by a Certificate of Title duly 
registered in the name of the owner. A Deed of Donation, in the case of donated lots, unless 

registered with the Register of Deeds of the city where the property is located, is not a 

conclusive evidence of ownership. 

 

86. Office Buildings and Land Improvements amounting to ₱147,385,176.36 and 
₱950,000.00, respectively, were recorded under DOST XII’s PPE accounts. However, due 

to absence of Torrens Title drawn in favor of the DOST XII over the land where these 

buildings were constructed and land improvements were expended, Management’s 

assertion on ownership cannot be established. Details are presented in Table 12: 
 
                                        Table 12.  Details on Building and Land Improvements

Building – Gensan City* - 

TOTAL 148,335,176.36 

    *Land was donated or allocation only 

 

87. As per inquiry with Management, they are still preparing the necessary documents 
in order to fully transfer the ownership of the donated lot. They also explained that the 

Deed of Donation and MOA over the additional lot, where the laboratory building is 

constructed, are still in process.  

 



74 

 

88. The Audit Team is concerned that Management could not fully assert their rights 
over these properties since until now there are no records of Land in the books of the agency 

where these structures are presently constructed. Absolute ownership of land therefore 

cannot be strongly established, and the existence of properties cannot be relied upon, 

thereby, casting doubt on the fair presentation of the financial statements and ultimately 

exposing the properties within the land to possible loss of ownership. 

 

89. We recommended and the DOST XII Management agreed to give preferential 
attention to secure the needed documents for the titling of the lands and the 

registration of the Deeds of Donation for the donated lots with the Registry of Deeds 

of the province where the property is located, to protect the interest of the government 

and to present fairly the assets owned by the agency in the year-end Financial 

Statements. 

 

i. Deficiencies in the grant, utilization, and implementation of Research Projects 
 

i. Disbursement for capital outlay component of research projects without DBM/ 
Legislative approval and fund transfer for activities within the mandate of NGAs 

 

90. The list of completed projects included construction of facilities with aggregate 
cost of ₱820,505,592.63 funded out of the Maintenance and Other Operating 

Expenses (MOOE) allotment under the General Appropriations Act (GAA) without 

the corresponding approval from the DBM on the allotment modification or more 

appropriately a legislative approval for the capital outlay component of the research 

projects under S&T GIA fund releases. Further, funds totaling ₱121,613,469.42 were 

transferred for projects deemed to be the regular mandate of IAs, hence, should have 

been funded out of their specific budget under the GAA.  
 

91. The list of completed projects showed the following.

92. The above projects were more on construction of facilities funded out of the MOOE 
under the GAA without the corresponding approval from the DBM on the allotment 

modification or more appropriately a legislative approval for the capital outlay component 

of the research projects under S&T GIA fund releases. 

 

93. The GAA for FY 2020, Section 70 states: “Rules on Modification in Allotment. As 
a general rule, departments, bureaus and offices of the national government, including 

Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs shall spend what is programmed 

in their respective appropriations in this Act. In exceptional circumstances, agencies may 

modify the allotment issued within an activity or project subject to approval of the 

following ensued by the timely submission of reports by all offices concerned: 

 

(a) X x x 
(b) The DBM, in the following modifications: (i) from one allotment class to another; 

(ii) from one operating unit to another; (iii) within a special purpose fund; and 

(iv) for the payment of magna carta benefits authorized under /section 50 hereof 

(c) X xx “ 
 

94. It is emphasized that the GIA fund is under the MOOE allotment class. Using the 
same to fund capital outlay projects, therefore, runs counter to the above provision of the 

GAA. 

 

95. Likewise, listed in Table 14 were funds transferred to other agencies for projects 
that were considered their regular mandate and one program had no specific project to fund, 

to wit:

 Sub-Total (Years 2017 and 2018) 61,613,469.42  

 Total 121,613,469.42   

 

96. The amount of ₱60,000,000.00 was transferred to Technology Application and 
Promotion Institute (TAPI) based on the approved program and not on specific projects. 

Cost was determined by percentage of the components of the program. On the otherhand,  

the total amount of ₱61,613,469.42 was transferred to Science and Technology Information 

Institute (STII) for projects deemed to be their regular mandate, that should be funded out 

of their agency budget under the GAA.  

 

97. We recommended and Management agreed to:  (a) confer with the DBM to 
seek legislative funding approval of the capital outlay component of research projects 

under the S&T GIA fund releases through the GAA; and (b) judiciously screen 

projects for funding to avoid allocating funds to Agencies for programs which should 

have been funded from their specific budgets under the GAA. 

 

98. Management has noted the recommendation and commented that matters will be 
conferred with the DBM for clarifications. Further, the fund transfers to TAPI as a block 

grant was intended for Technicom Program previously being implemented by the Office 

of the Undersecretary for R&D. It is now transferred to TAPI but not yet included in the 

agency’s budget. On the other hand, due to insufficiency of funding by STII, a fund transfer 

was also made to them to further boost the promotion of DOST programs. 

 

99. As a rejoinder, we recommend that funds downloaded shall be based on approved 
research project proposals/LIB submitted by implementing NGAs/partners, with itemized 

details of expenditures  and covering request for funding and not as “block grant” to enforce 

commitment to deliver research outputs/deliverables.  

 

ii. Low turnout of research projects for commercialization and technology transfer 
 

100. Inadequate monitoring of Grants in Aid (GIA)- funded projects resulted in the 
low turnout of research projects for commercialization and technology transfer with 

only 4.21 percent and 27.36 percent, respectively, out of the 95 projects evaluated, 

thus, is not supportive of the overall goal of the DOST that is “to ensure that the 

results of scientific and technological activities are properly applied and utilized to 

accelerate economic and social development.” 

 

101. Section 4 of Executive Order No. 128, s. of 1987 mandates the DOST to formulate 
and implement policies, plans, programs, and projects to the development of science and 

technology and for the promotion of scientific and technological activities for both the 

public and private sectors, and to ensure that the results of scientific and technological 

activities are properly applied and utilized to accelerate economic and social development. 

 



77 

 

102. Pursuant to this, the DOST through its GIA Program, aims to harness the country’s 
scientific and technological capabilities to spur and attain sustainable economic growth and 

development. Through the funding of relevant science and technology (S&T) undertakings, 

the GIA program aims to contribute to productivity improvement and quality of life of 

Filipinos by generating and promoting appropriate technologies. Likewise, it seeks to 

strengthen the participation of various S&T sectors particularly in research and 

development (R&D), promotion, technology transfer and utilization, human resource 

development, information dissemination, advocacy, and linkages. 

 

103. Validation of project implementation to find out the monitoring activities 
undertaken by the DOST CO and to assess whether such projects really helped in the 

country’s economic and social development, showed that out of 95 projects completed in 

CYs 2016 to 2019 with a total cost of   ₱5,074,005,275.01, only 49 projects or 51.57 percent 

were monitored after their completion, four (4) research projects with a total cost of 

₱211,996,452.39 or a mere 4.21 percent, were for commercialization and 26 projects with 

total costs of ₱965,339,181.62 or 27.37 percent were for technology transfer. The result is 

shown in Table 15:

     51.57% 3.15% 8.42% 4.21% 8.42% 27.36% 

 

104. It is good to note that in CYs 2016 and 2019, all the projects consisting of 22 and 
eight projects, respectively, were followed though after completion. While seven (7) out of 

12 or 58.33 percent of projects were monitored in CY 2018, the worst was in CY 2017 

where only 12 or 22.64 percent was monitored out of the 53 projects. 

 

105. Albeit the four projects for commercialization amounting to ₱211,996,452.39 and 
26 projects for technology transfer of ₱965,339,181.62 or a total of ₱1,177,335,634.01, 

still these represents only 23.20 percent of the total cost of 95 projects evaluated totaling 

₱5,074,005,275.01. 

 

106. Although the commercialized and transferred technology’s impact on the citizenry 
were not studied yet, it should have been better if a higher number of projects were 

translated into projects with direct benefits to the people in order to realize the overall goal 

of the DOST “to ensure that the results of scientific and technological activities are 

properly applied and utilized to accelerate economic and social development.” Thus, an 

increase in the reported key performance indicator (KPI) on research projects 

accomplished/completed. 



78 

 

 

107. We recommended and Management agreed to conduct a follow 
through/monitoring on a regular basis to determine if projects already completed 

have truly benefited the citizenry; and consider including completed research 

projects commercialized and technology transferred among the reported Key 

Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the DOST. 

 

iii. Utilization of funds beyond its specific purpose  
 

108. Trust receipts amounting to ₱537,600.00 from the Department of Health 
Regional Office No. 1 (DOH RO I) were utilized for a project not within the specific 

purpose for which the Trust was created or the funds received, contrary to the 

provisions of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, COA Circular No. 2012-003 and 

DOST I - DOH I MOA on the Roll-out of 1,000 RxBoxTeleHealth Devices in selected 

Rural Health Centers in the Philippines.  
 

109. Item 12 of Annex B of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated 29 October 2012 listed 
that the use of funds intended for a specific purpose/ project, for other purposes such as 

administrative and miscellaneous expenses of the implementing agency, and for projects 

not intended to be implemented under the program as an illegal expenditure. 

 

110. Item II.3 and 4 of the MOA dated 14 March 2017 between DOST I and DOH RO I 
on the implementation of the project “Roll-out of 1,000 RxBoxTelehealth Devices in 

Selected Rural Health Centers in the Philippines” states:  

 

“3. DOH RO I shall facilitate the release of additional funds amounting to 

₱2,000,000.00 to support training activities of the PROJECT to DOST RO I  

 

4. The funds shall be expended as allocated in the approved LIB.” 

 

111. The said fund was used for the design and deployment of a system to facilitate the 
contact tracing of COVID-19 or the CovidDETECT Information System, which according 

to them, is their response to address the threats posed by the pandemic. This request was 

consequently approved by the DOH Regional Director. 

 

112. However, the system is very much in line with the mandate and mission of DOST 
as a whole, thus, can be considered under Disaster Risk Reduction Management (DRRM) 

expenditures. 

 

113. We recommended and the DOST I Management agreed to:  
 

a. submit a copy of the approval of their request for an authority duly 
approved by DOH CO for DOST I to use the trust fund for the development 

of CovidDETECT Information System aside from the RxBoxTelehealth 

Devices, since without the necessary approval of the request, the payments 

made for the CovidDETECT Information System can be considered 



79 

 

unauthorized expenditures as defined under COA Circular No. 2012-003; 

and 

 

b. comply strictly with the provisions set forth in the agreed MOA on the 
budget reprogramming or realignment and project completion. 

 

Other Compliance Issues  

 

a. Delayed or non-submission of financial reports and transaction documents 

 

114. Delays or non-submission of financial reports, transaction records, bank 
reconciliation statements, and copies of contracts/purchase orders prevented the 

conduct of thorough analysis and verification of the accounts and transactions for 

timely discharge of relevant audit results. 

 

115. The late submission of the financial reports, disbursement and collection records 
and copies of contracts/purchase orders had been observed during the year, as shown in

116. The delayed submission of the transaction records and financial reports precluded 
us from timely and systematically reviewing the propriety of the disbursements and 

analyzing the correctness of the accounting entries as well as from communicating timely 

and relevant audit results to Management. 

 

117. The DOST NCR liquidations pertaining to fund transfers to various IAs were not 
adequately supported with invoices, official receipts and/or other documents that evidence 

the disbursements and the incurrence of expenditures, as required in the aforementioned 

circulars, which cast doubt as to the validity of the expenditures shown in the audited 

Financial Reports; thus, the reliability of the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) and 

Receivables account balances could not be ascertained. In addition, the deficiency of 

supporting documents in the liquidation reports may result to erroneous accounting entries 

due to improper classification of expenditures, brought about by the absence of RCI or the 

report of advice to debit account issued (RADAI) presenting the disbursements as well as 

the expenditures for the aforementioned project. This may have resulted in the 

misstatement of pertinent expense accounts in the face of the statement of financial 

performance. 

 

118. More importantly, timely and relevant information was not afforded to the DOST 
Management for decision-making as well as to the wide range of users of the financial 

statements, which includes the oversight agencies and the public, in making and evaluating 



81 

 

decisions about the DOST’s allocation of resources and its accountability for the resources 

entrusted to it. 

 

119. We recommended and Management agreed to enjoin the concerned Regional 
Directors of: 

 

a. DOST CAR to require the BAC Secretariat to submit copies of all 
contracts and purchase orders, together with their supporting 

documents, within five (5) working days from execution or issuance 

thereof; 

 

b. DOST NCR to require the Regional Accountant to:  
 

i. meticulously review the submitted liquidation reports of the IAs 
and ensure that the same is in accordance with the prescribed 

guidelines and requirements; and 

 

ii. further ensure that subsequent transactions are recognized in the 
books of accounts in accordance with the proper cut-off period to 

also accurately present the related expense accounts; 

 

c. DOST IV-A to require the Accounting Division to:  
 

i. submit the 1,647 Disbursement Vouchers and supporting 
documents from October to December 2020; and  

 

ii. henceforth, observe strict compliance in the submission of 
reports within the prescribed period (within ten (10) days of the 

ensuing month), to facilitate post-audit/review of accounts/ 

transactions; 

 

d. DOST V to :  
 

i. require the Regional Accountant and other accountable officers 
to submit the required accounting and financial reports, and 

supporting documents within the prescribed deadlines; and 

 

ii. institute appropriate measures that will enable the agency to 
meet such deadlines; 

 

e. DOST VII to: 
 

i. instruct the Accounting personnel to strictly adhere to the 
provisions stated under Section 74 of PD 1445 and the GAM for 

the prompt and regular preparation and submission of BRS; and  

 



82 

 

ii. monitor the preparation and monthly submission of the BRS and 
coordinate closely with the depository banks by requesting them 

for the prompt preparation of the monthly bank statements so 

that the BRS can be prepared on time; and  

 

f. DOST VIII to: 
 

i. require the Regional Accountant or the personnel performing 
the duties of said position to submit to the Audit Team all 

required Reports and their supporting documents within the 

deadline, which can be initially done by submission through 

email;  
 

ii. instruct the Cashier and all AOs to strictly observe the 
submission of all reports and records within the prescribed 

period; and 

 

iii. issue a memorandum or equivalent communication to the 
personnel concerned/responsible in the preparation and 

submission of reports and other related/supporting documents 

within the reglementary period.  

 

b. Disbursements not adequately supported and other non-compliance issues 
 

120. Disbursements totaling ₱2,715,359.83 were not adequately supported with 
documentary requirements which is inconsistent with Section 4 of Presidential Decree 

No. 1445, thus, accuracy and validity of the claims could not be established in audit. 

Moreover, honoraria paid directly to concerned personnel who act as lecturers, 

resource persons, coordinators, and facilitators, and those who are assigned in special 

projects, and members of committees, hence, benefits received were not properly 

accounted and monitored for the 25 percent annual salary threshold and taxation 

purposes. 

 

121. Item 6, Section 4 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 (PD No. 1445) states that 
“Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.”

122. Absence of the above-mentioned documentary requirements renders the propriety 
of disbursements doubtful, as we may not be able to ascertain the validity of the claims. 

 

123. We recommended and the DOST IX, XI and XIII Managements agreed to 
require:  

 

a. The responsible officers to immediately submit the required documents 
to avoid suspension of transactions; 

 

b. The concerned officials/heads of office to ensure compliance with the 
submission of complete and sufficient supporting papers on all claims 

against government funds as required under Section 4(6) of PD 1445, 

COA Circular No. 2012-001, COA Circular No. 77-61, and DBM-DOST

c. The Regional Accountant to ensure that the payment for honoraria be 
remitted to the respective mother agencies of government personnel with 

the corresponding certificates on the taxes withheld and that honoraria 

paid to all those under special projects do not exceed the 25 percent

c. Non-maintenance of books and records 
 

124. DOST CAR, III, and XI Management failed to regularly maintain and update 
its books and records, contrary to the GAM, Volume I. 

 

125. Section 10, Chapter 3 of the GAM, Volume I provides that the Registries of 
Allotments, Obligations and Disbursements (RAOD) shall be maintained by the Budget 

Division/Unit of agencies to record allotments, obligations, and disbursements. 

 

126. Section 3.b, Chapter 4 of the GAM, Volume I also provides that the NCA shall be 
monitored through the maintenance of the Registry of Allotments and Notice of Cash 

Allocation (RANCA) by the Accounting Division/Unit.  Section 4.b, same chapter further 

provides that the Notice of Transfer of Allocation (NTA) shall be monitored through the 

maintenance of the Registry of Allotment and Notice of Transfer of Allocation (RANTA). 

 

127. Section 9, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I provides that supplies and materials 
purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual inventory system

that requires the maintenance of the SLC by the Accounting Division/Unit and Stock Card 

by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock 

 

128. Section 32, Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume I provides that the accountable 
officer/special disbursing officer shall prepare the Report of Cash Disbursement (RCDisb) 

and maintain the Cash Disbursement Record (CDRec) to monitor and control the granting 

and utilization of CA. 

 

129. Section 37, Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume I provides that the Petty Cash Fund 
Custodian (PCFC) shall prepare the Report on Paid Petty Cash Vouchers (RPPCVs) and 

maintain the Petty Cash Fund Record (PCFR) to monitor and control the granting and 

utilization of the fund. The RPPCVs shall be the basis in the preparation of the JEV which 

shall be recorded by the bookkeeper in the CDJ. The Accounting Division/Unit shall 

maintain SL to monitor and control accountability.  

 

130. Various books and records were not maintained and updated regularly by DOST 
CAR, III, and XI as summarized in Table 18:

The Registries of Allotments, Obligations and Disbursements (RAODs) were not updated by the Budget 
Office, and the Registry of Allotments and Notice of Cash Allocation (RANCAs) as well as the Registry 
of Allotment and Notice of Transfer of Allocation (RANTAs) were not maintained by the Accounting Office. 
These were contrary to Section 10, Chapter 3, and Sections 3 and 4, Chapter 6 of the GAM. 
On the non-maintenance of RAODs, the Budget Officer explained that her office lacked staff to do the 
job. On the non-maintenance of RANCAs and RANTAs, the Accountant informed that she was not aware 
that she has to maintain such registries. 

Supplies ledger cards (SLC) and stock cards (SC) for office and laboratory supplies were not maintained 
contrary to Chapter 8 of the GAM 

III 

The Accountable Officer failed to regularly maintain and update the Check and Advices to Debit Account 
Disbursements Record (CkADADRec) contrary to Section 42, Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM, thus, 
proper recording/monitoring of all checks (MDS and Commercial) drawn and ADAs issued as well as the 
determination of the actual balance of the NCA/Checking account could not readily be established or 
determined. 

The Accountable Officer failed to maintain and update the Petty Cash Fund Record (PCFR) contrary to 
37, Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM, thus the proper recording of the petty cash advance received as 
well as the utilization and replenishment were not observed. 
It was observed that the check number and the amount of petty cash replenishments were not properly 
recorded. Inquiry disclosed that due to voluminous workload in the Cashiering Section, the updating and 
maintenance of the PCFR was not judiciously done, however, the AO informed that she would do her 
best to properly update and maintain all her records. 

XI 
The Special Disbursing Officers (SDO) did not maintain Cash Disbursement Record (CDRec) contrary to 
the provisions in Section 32, Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM. 

 

131. Failure to maintain and regularly update the said books and records may result to 
difficulties in monitoring the NTA, grants and utilization of CA and PCF, purchase and 

issuance of supplies, and allotments, obligations and disbursements. 

 

 



86 

 

132. We recommended and the DOST CAR, III, and XI Managements agreed to 
require: 

 

a. The Budget Officer to maintain the RAOD, and the Accountant to 
maintain the RANCA and RANTA; 

 

b. The Accountant and the Supply Officer to maintain the SLC and the 
SC, respectively, and reconcile the same with the Report on the 

Physical Count of Inventories;  

 

c. The Accountable Officer (AO) to regularly update and maintain the 
CkADADRec, record all checks drawn and ADAs issued during the day 

and conduct regular reconciliation between the NCA Received/Deposit 

made and the Checks and ADAs issued; 

 

d. The PCF Custodian/SDOs to regularly update and maintain 
PCFR/CDRec to monitor the utilization of CAs and replenishments of 

PCF; and  

 

e. The Finance and Administrative Division to conduct re-orientation of 
all Accountable Officers on the accounting procedures and 

documentary requirements to be submitted and maintained in 

accordance with the GAM. 

 

d. Not updated GL and SL and incomplete accounting records 

 

133. In DOST XII, both the general and subsidiary ledgers were not updated and 
the accounting records on 36 accounts with a total amount of ₱447,927,262.66 were 

lacking/not complete, thus, preventing alternative audit procedures from being 

undertaken to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence relating to various 

assertions on the accounts. 

 

134. Section 27 of the IPSAS 1 provides that “Financial statements shall present fairly 
the financial position, financial performance, and cash flow of an entity. Fair presentation 

requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and 

conditions in accordance with definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 

revenue, and expenses set out in IPSAS.” 

 

135. Moreover, Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provide that 
the accounts of the agency shall be kept in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the 

agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by the fiscal or 

control agencies of the government; and that the highest standard of honesty, objectivity 

and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against 

inaccurate and misleading information. Each government agency shall record its financial 

transactions and operations conformably with IPSAS and in accordance with pertinent laws 

and regulations. 



87 

 

 

136. The failure of the Regional Accountant to observe due care in the keeping of the 
accounts and the inadequate review by the responsible/concerned officials resulted in 

transactions not accurately and timely recorded, not properly supported and rules and 

policies not consistently applied, leading to inaccurate financial information. 

 

137. We recommended and the DOST XII Management agreed to require the 
Accountant to prepare and update the GL and SLs, together with the complete  

supporting documents and accounting records, and to observe the highest degree of 

objectivity and consistency in the keeping of the accounts to safeguard the same 

against inaccurate or misleading information. 
 

e. Procurement Law (RA 9184) and its IRR not strictly observed 
 

138. DOST II, V, and VIII have not observed and/or complied with certain 
provisions of RA 9184 and its Revised IRR in the procurement of goods and services 

amounting to ₱18,441,134.55. 

 

139. RA 9184 and its Revised IRR were promulgated for the purpose of prescribing the 
necessary rules and regulations for the standardization and regulation of procurement 

activities of all government agencies and instrumentalities. Provisions therein are in line 

with the government’s effort to adhere to the principles of transparency, accountability, 

equity, efficiency, and economy in the procurement process.

Table 20.  Management Comments and Auditor’s Rejoinder 

Office Management Comment Auditor’s Rejoinder 

II 

On the advance payment above 50% of the contract 
price, the management explained the following: 

a. The Philippine Foundation for Science and 
Technology (PFST) is the only supplier of 
the needed equipment. 

 With regard to the Management beliefs that 
the supplier satisfied the requirements under 
the “industry practiced”, the GPPB NPM 008-
2008 states that, “Item 4.3 reveals that the 
phrase "services where requirement of down 
payment is a standard industry practice" 



89 

 

Office Management Comment Auditor’s Rejoinder 

b. Upon their checking with some of the 
clients of PFST before awarding the 
contract, they vouched to DOST II that an 
advance payment for the ordered 
equipment was made. 

c. Also, the purpose of the prohibition against 
advance payment is to protect the 
government from the possibility of not 
receiving goods, supplies and materials for 
which it has already paid. DOST II had 
been in collaboration with the PFST for 
more than 20 years already. The risk of the 
government not to receive the ordered 
equipment was already calculated in view 
of the many partnership projects 
implemented by DOST II and PFST and 
the “GOODWILL” that had built over the 
years. 

d. That the DOST 02 considered the giving of 
the 50% advance payment because they 
believed that it had satisfied the 
requirements under the “industry 
practiced” and they banked on the 
“goodwill” that the DOST II have with 
PFST. 

merely describes the three (3) enumerated 
services, namely: (i) hotel and restaurant 
services, (ii) use of conference/seminar and 
exhibit areas, and (iii) lease of office space, 
where advance payment not to exceed fifty 
percent (50%) is allowed. It is not a catch-all 
phrase which permits a procuring entity to add 
another instance.”  
 

 Also, long-term association with the supplier 
and the established goodwill does not give 
assurance that, in all instances, they will fulfill 
their obligation, thus risk of loss still exist. 

 

 Hence, the Audit Team (AT) maintains its 
position that no advance payment, or any 
payment made prior to the delivery and 
acceptance of goods beyond the 15% allowed 
under Item 4, Annex D of RA 9184, otherwise 
the agency should seek approval from the 
Office of the President. 

 

II 

For the purchase of equipment without the warranty 
security, Management commented that there was 
confusion in the understanding of the retainment of 
warranty which led to the non-compliance, however 
they will be coordinating with the supplier to correct 
the error. 

The AT will monitor its implementation and in the 
succeeding procurement of the agency. 

V 

The Management commented that some suppliers 
were previously informed of their existing receivables 
with the DOST V, however awaiting written requests 
for the release of their retention money and 
performance bond. Accordingly, to date, four 
suppliers already claimed their retention money 
amounting to ₱321,708.16.  The Management shall 
notify the suppliers again of their receivables from 
the DOST V. 

 

V 
As of 31 December 2020, a total liquidated damage 
of ₱374,220.00 was imposed and collected from the 
supplier. 

 

VIII 

Concerning the lease of venue, the management 
admitted that they inadvertently overlooked some 
procedures in the procurement of lease of venue and 
assured that in the succeeding related 
procurements, audit recommendations will be strictly 
observed.

145. The non-compliance of the concerned Regional Offices with the guidelines set in 
DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1 series of 2013 resulted in overpayment of the above 

benefits. 

 

146. We recommended and the DOST III, IV-B, V and XIII Management agreed to 
require the Accountant and staff to:  

 

a. strictly follow and observe the rules and procedures embodied under DBM-
DOST Joint Circular No. 1 series of 2013 in the grant/payment of Magna 

Carta benefits to avoid overpayments which may ultimately become 

disallowances in audit;  

 

b. require the refund of the overpayments and remit the same to the Bureau of 
the Treasury; and 

 



91 

 

c. require the personnel in-charge to compute the Magna Carta benefits based 
on the DTRs for the actual services rendered/actual exposure in strict 

compliance with DBM-DOST Joint Circular and DOST Administrative 

Order No. 010, series 2013. 

 

g. Technology Resource Center (TRC)  
 

147. In DOST CO, the winding down of the affairs of the defunct TRC has already 
exceeded the three-year limitation, contary to the provisions set forth under Item 4.1 

(b) of GCG Memorandum Circular No. 2015-03 dated 08 April 2015. 

 

148. Pursuant to GCG Memorandum No. 2015-11, the DOST was designated as the 
Supervising Agency in the winding down of operations of the abolished TRC effective 31 

October 2015 until the corporate assets are disposed through the Privatization and 

Management Office (PMO). Accordingly, the “TRC Winding Down of Operations Project 

Team” was created by the then DOST Secretary Mario G. Montejo, headed by the former 

DOST Assistant Secretary (ASec) Urduja A. Tejada, under DOST Special Order No. 336, 

dated 13 July 2016. Following the resignation of ASec Tejada, an amendment to the 

original composition of the Project Team was issued per DOST Special Order No. 336A, 

dated 14 October 2016, of the then newly appointed DOST Secretary Fortunato T. de la 

Peña. Various reconstitutions of the said team was made subsequent thereto.   

 

149. It was noted that as of 31 December 2020, the winding down affairs of the TRC 
was still on-going, thus, exceeding the three-year limitation, contrary to the provisions set 

forth under Item 4.1 (b) of GCG Memorandum Circular No. 2015-03 dated 08 April 2015, 

to wit: 

 

Liquidation, which takes place immediately after dissolution and involves, but 

is not limited to, the settlement and adjustment of claims against the GOCC, 

payment of its just debts, and collecting all that is due the corporation. In no 

case shall the period of Liquidation of a GOCC exceed three (3) years 

pursuant to the Corporation Code. 

 

150. We recommended and Management agreed to confer with the Governance 
Commission for GOCCs (GCG) the actions to be taken by the DOST in the winding 

down of TRC operations, which could not be completed within a period of three (3) 

years. 

 

151. Management commented that per GCG letter dated 14 June 2017 a dissolved 
corporation shall be allowed to continue liquidating its remaining assets in order to 

complete the process of its dissolution. X x x. Thus, disposition of corporate assets, through 

sale or other modes, to fully liquidate the corporation may continue until all corporate 

liabilities have been satisfied, or corporate properties have been exhausted. However, the 

matter was referred to GCG on March 4, 2021 to address the concern of the Audit Team. 

 

 



92 

 

h. Transactions for TRC not supported with complete documentation 
 

152. In DOST III, 84 disbursement vouchers of DOST-TRC amounting to 
₱3,039,076.09 were not duly supported with complete documentations, contrary to 

Section 4, paragraph 6 of Presidential Decree No. 1445, thus, creating doubt on the 

validity, legality, and propriety of the transactions. 

 

153. Section 4, paragraph 6 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 states that “Claims 
against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation”. 

 

154. Record shows that DOST CO and DOST III executed a MOA whereby DOST was 
tasked to oversee the winding up and liquidation of the Technology Resource Center (TRC) 

on its closure. The DOST shall take all proper and necessary steps to protect the interest of 

the government in connection with the winding down of the operations, disposition of the 

assets and settlement of the liabilities of TRC including the preservation of its assets until 

such time that it has been disposed. While DOST III was tasked to oversee the 

administration of the DOST-TRC Techno Centers in DOST III. 

 

155. It was indicated in the MOA that the procurement of Capital Outlay and Equipment 
and the payment of the MOOE expenses are to be undertaken by the DOST CO situated in 

Bicutan, Taguig City, Metro Manila. The payments for utilities like electric and 

communications were sometimes being paid in cash and subject to reimbursement to avoid 

the incurrence of penalty charges or sanction of disconnection due to late payment. 

 

156. The payment of electric, communications, gasoline and other supplies and materials 
should be made out of check or List of Due and Demandable Accounts Payable (LDDAP) 

so as not to deprive income for the government through tax remittances.  

 

157. To expedite the processing of payment of MOOE contracted by DOST-TRC and 
considering the distance and travel time, the DOST-TRC Techno Center Administrators 

recommended the procurement/payment of capital outlay, equipment and MOOE for 

CY2020 be undertaken by DOST III. This was approved by the DOST-TRC Transition 

Committee through a resolution. 

 

158. Subsequently, funds amounting to ₱9,720,710.00 representing MOOE expenses 
from April to December 2020 inclusive of the 13 February to 31 March 2020 payables for 

Other General Services amounting to ₱95,525.35 and Equipment requirement of 

₱626,800.00 were transferred.  In connection thereto, the DOST III shall submit a quarterly 

status of funds including reports of disbursements to apprise the DOST Transition Team 

and for monitoring purposes. An audited financial report shall also be submitted at the end 

of the year. 

 

159. Audit of the expenditures/transactions of DOST-TRC disclosed that some pertinent 
supporting documents were not attached to the various claims. 

 



93 

 

160. Upon inquiry, the Accountant commented that, usually before processing claims, 
the supporting documents were being checked and scrutinized by designated staff as to its 

completeness. The lacking documents noted might have been mixed up and inadvertently 

attached in the Management files or detached during segregation process. Some of the 

documents might not be present or have been unintentionally overlooked by the concerned 

end-users. Nonetheless, she committed the submission of the lacking documents.  

 

161. The validity, legality and propriety of the transactions could not be ascertained due 
to the failure to support the payment of expenses with complete documentation. The 

practice of Management of processing and paying claims with incomplete documentation 

is irregular such that expenses paid might be suspended and/or disallowed in audit. 

 

162. We recommended and Management agreed to enjoin the DOST III Regional 
Director to require the Accountant and/or concerned accounting staff to ensure that 

all claims be supported with complete documentation before payment and cause the 

immediate submission of the above financial documents to the Office of the Auditor, 

to avoid future suspension or disallowance. 

 

i. Marawi Fund 
 

163. The DOST XII received Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) No. BMB-E-19-
0022272 dated 28 November 2019 for Fiscal Year 2019, from the Regular Agency Fund, 

Continuing Appropriations, RA 10964 (FY2018 GAA) NDRRM Fund, to cover the 

funding requirements for the continued implementation of the “DOST XII support for 

Marawi city recovery, reconstruction and rehabilitation thru Science and Technology 

Intervention and Innovation, Promotion of Healthy Resilient, Marawi City and Lanao Del 

Sur” in the total amount of ₱152,200,000.00. 

 

164. As of reporting date, however, there was no fund transfer due to the late submission 
of schedules, late submission of sufficient evidence with the proper authority to support 

the claims with the Department of Budget and Management (DBM). This was caused by 

lapses and miscommunications of the detailed Officer In-Charge, thus, failing to request 

for funding for the said project.  

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

165. The DOST CO and ROs were able to formulate GAD Plan and Budget and 
notably attributed the programs that are gender-related with allocated funds of 

₱403,951,308.49 and actual expenditures of ₱561,884,120.92 or 10.26 of the overall 

budget of the Agency. 

 

166. Section 31 of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year 2020 or RA 
11465 requires that all agencies of the government formulate a GAD Plan designed to 

address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement applicable 

provisions of R.A. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Elimination of 

All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the 



94 

 

Millennium Development Goals (2000-2015), the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive 

Development (1995-2025), and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022). 

 

167. Moreover, RA 11465 requires all government agencies to allocate at least five 
percent (5%) of their budgets to undertake activities that will address gender issues within 

their concerned mandates. The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 

agencies and should relate to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of 

marginalized women, protection, promotion and fulfillment of women’s rights and practice 

of gender-responsive governance. 

 

168. For CY 2020, the DOST had substantially implemented GAD Plan and Budget 
(GPD) with a consolidated budget of ₱403,951,308.49, which constitutes 7.38 percent of 

the total budget of the Agency of ₱5,474,553,000.00, and with expenditures for GAD 

related projects mainstreamed in the regular activities of DOST amounting to 

₱561,884,120.92 or 139.10 percent of the total allocated budget for GAD and 10.26 percent 

of the total budget of the Agency. 

 

169. The consolidated accomplishment reports of DOST CO and ROs for GAD are 
shown in Table 22.

170. We commended Management on DOST’s compliance with GAD laws and 
regulations, and we recommended that they continue providing adequate allocation 

of funds for programs and activities that will uplift the gender issues of officers and 

employees as well as implementation of the planned programs and activities for its 

clients, the general public. 

 

Senior Citizen and Persons with Disability 

 

171. The DOST had substantially complied with Section 32 of the General 
Provisions of RA 11465, otherwise known as the GAA for FY 2020, in implementing 

of programs/projects for senior citizens and persons with disability (PWDs) with the 



95 

 

total expenditure of ₱61,785,783.29 through various activities relating to the elderly 

and differently-abled persons/PWDs. 

 

172. Section 32 of RA No. 11465 requires states that “All agencies of the government 
shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior 

citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and 

integrate the same in their regular activities. Moreover, all government infrastructures and 

facilities shall provide architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will 

reasonably enhance, the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability pursuant to 

Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA 7277, as amended” 

 

173. For CY 2020, the DOST implemented programs for senior citizens and PWDs with 
total expenditures of ₱61,785,783.29, distributed as follows: 

 

Office  Expenditures (₱) 

CO  41, 300.00

X              278,125.00  

XII           2,048,000.00  

Total         61,785,783.29  

 

174. Some of the activities undertaken for Senior Citizens and PWDs were as follows: 
 

a. Designed S & T laboratory new building with elevator to provide proper access 
and facilities for PWDs, SCs and pregnant women, and maintenance of 

facilities such as parking space, comfort rooms and walkway for SCPD 

 

b. Small Enterprises Technology Upgrading Program (SETUP)-assisted projects 
with Senior Citizen-Beneficiaries;

shields, and hygiene kits for persons with disability/senior citizens, 

youth/students, women and children for protection against COVID-19 

pandemic. 

 



96 

 

175. We commended Management in the implementation of the expanded coverage 
of senior citizens and the programs and services for PWDs that greatly helped address 

their concerns. 

 

Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts 

 

176. DOST, as a whole, complied with the withholding and remittance of 
mandatory deductions pursuant to the regulations issued by the BIR, GSIS, PHIC 

and HDMF, summarized in Table 23. 

 
Table 23.  Analysis of Mandatory Accounts

Due to Philhealth 

During the year, CO and ROs withheld monthly contributions of its officers and

97 

 

Compliance with Insurance Law 

 

179. The DOST offices had substantially complied with the insurance of 
government assets with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS, except for DOST 

CAR which inadequately insured its PPE amounting to ₱45,290,944.15, thereby, 

depriving the office of adequate protection against damage to or loss of its properties 

in cases of fortuitous events/casualty. 

 

180. Section 5 of RA 656 provides that every government is required to insure its 
properties with the Property Insurance Fund against any insurable risk. As defined in 

Section 4(c) of the RA, property includes vessels and craft, motor vehicles, machineries, 

permanent buildings, properties stored therein, or in buildings rented by the Government, 

or properties in transit. 

 

181. Details of the insurance premiums paid by DOST Offices in insuring its eligible 
assets for CY 2020 with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS are presented hereunder:

Total 553,805,730.98 4,003,249.16 

 

182. For the DOST CAR, out of the ₱110,944,851.27 recorded PPE of the agency as at 
CY 2019, only ₱64,552,245.63 were reported to the GSIS for insurance. The physical 

assets that were not insured with the GSIS included PPE worth ₱45,290,944.15, thereby, 

depriving the office of adequate protection against damage to or loss of its properties in 

cases of fortuitous events/casualty. 

 

183. Management of DOST CAR explained that the uninsured properties are either (a) 
PPE for the Local Grants-in-Aid (LGIA) Projects which will eventually be transferred to 

the cooperator as stated in the respective MOAs; (b) subject to donation; (c) subject to 

condemnation; or (d) have exceeded their useful lives. 

 

184. We recommended and Management agreed to enjoin the Regional Directors 
to insure all insurable government assets and properties under their administration 

pursuant to RA 656. 

 

185. The Auditor of DOST CAR expressed that as long as the properties for LGIA 
projects are not yet transferred or donated and are still in the books of accounts of DOST 

CAR and are still serviceable despite exceeding their useful lives, they should be insured 

to protect the agency from risks of damage and loss. 

 



98 

 

Job Order Personnel 
 

186. The DOST CO and the Regional Offices had employed a total of 1,216 
personnel on a job order contract basis, for calendar year 2020 with total wages of 

₱266,024,169.45, to augment the present manpower for its operation. 

 

187. Section 2 of the Civil Service Commision (CSC), Commission on Audit (COA) and 
Department of Budget and Management (DBM), Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2017 dated 15 June 

2017 states that government agencies are authorized to enter into service contracts with 

other government agencies, private firms, non-government agencies or individuals services 

related or incidental to their respective functions and operations, whether on a part-time or 

full time basis.
