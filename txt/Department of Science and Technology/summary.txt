C. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of the DOST Central and 16 

Regional Offices for CY 2020. The audit was conducted to a) verify the level of 

assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) 

recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; (c) determine the propriety of 

transactions as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and 

regulations; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit 

recommendations.  

 
D. Independent Auditor’s Opinion 

 

The Agency’s Cash, Receivables, Inventories, PPE, Other Assets and Other 

Prepayments accounts have misstatements totaling ₱341.566 million representing 2.12 

percent of its total assets, while Inter-agency Payables and Trust Liabilities have 

misstatements of ₱16.171 million or 1.56 percent of the total reported Liabilities, and 

Accumulated Surplus/ (Deficit) account have misstatements of ₱281.390 million or 1.87 

percent of the total equity of the Agency as at 31 December 2020. Moreover, reported 

deficiencies totaling ₱1.148 billion also affected the Management assertions on the 

accuracy and completeness of the said accounts. Due to the significant impact of such 

misstatements and deficiencies, we rendered a Qualified Opinion on the financial 

statements of the DOST as at year-end
