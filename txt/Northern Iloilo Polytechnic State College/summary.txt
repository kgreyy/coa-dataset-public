	Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements

	

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of NIPSC for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to exceptions as stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report and as discussed in Part II of this Annual Audit Report Observations and Recommendations.



Bases for Qualified Opinion



1)			Deficiencies in the control mechanisms, such as the non-preparation of the CY 2020 Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) for properties amounting to P657.295 million, and the inclusion in the Property, Plant and Equipment account of properties below the capitalization threshold with a total amount of P374,358.00, rendered unreliable year-end PPE account balances, contrary to the provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, Chapter 8, Section 10 and Chapter 10, Sections 38 and 42. 

		

2)			Allowance for impairment provided for long outstanding receivables amounting to P74.928 million whose collectibility is uncertain, remained at P20.833 million since 2016, contrary to Section 10, Chapter 7 of GAM, Volume I, thus, the receivables account in the year-end financial statements were not fairly presented.



Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations

	

The following are additional significant observations and recommendations, other than the bases for the qualified opinion that need immediate attention and action by the Head of the Agency:

	

1)			Unreleased checks amounting to P61.957 million were not reverted back to the cash account while cancelled checks amounting to P0.997 million were not adjusted in the books as of year-end, contrary to Chapter 19, Section 56 and Chapter 6, Section 44 of the GAM Volume I, resulting to the understatement of the Cash in Bank and corresponding payable accounts.

		

We recommended and the Management agreed to:



a)				Direct the Cashiers to prepare the List of Unreleased Checks, which includes cancelled checks, that will be attached to the report of checks issued in accordance with GAM Volume I, Chapter 6, Section 44; 



b)				Direct the Accountants to prepare the accounting entries to recognize the cancelled checks in accordance with GAM Volume I, Chapter 6, Section 44; and



c)				Direct the Accountants to prepare the necessary entries to recognize unreleased checks as at year end and restore the same at the start of the ensuing year in accordance with GAM Volume I, Chapter 19, Section 56.

2)			Non-preparation of subsidiary ledgers (SLs) for asset and liability accounts amounting to P13.5 million and P27.711 million, respectively; variances between the financial statements and the Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) of the asset accounts of P4.002 million and the liability accounts of P 22.643 million; abnormal balances in the SLs; and deficiencies in the preparation of the SLs, contrary to Section 111 (1) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, rendered the year-end balances of these accounts unreliable.

		

	We recommended and the Management agreed to direct the Accountants to:

	

a)	Prepare Subsidiary Ledgers for each control account in the General Ledger (GL), with all  the necessary information, in accordance with Appendix 6 of GAM Volume II;



b)	Reconcile the noted variance between the financial statements and the SLs of P4.002 million and P22.643 million for the assets and liabilities, respectively;



c)	Reconcile the abnormal balances in the schedule of accounts and prepare the necessary corrections, when warranted;



d)	Strictly observe the appropriate use of account names and make the necessary entries to reclassify the affected accounts; and



e)	Conduct monthly reconciliation of the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) and the GL in accordance with Section 111 (1) of P.D. No. 1445 and Appendix 6 of GAM, Volume II.



3)			Cash advances amounting to P0.656 million were not liquidated as of December 31, 2020, notwithstanding that the purposes for which they were granted had already been served, contrary to Section 89 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445. Cash advances were also granted despite the deficiencies in the supporting documents, contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001. These resulted to a substantial amount of cash advances overdue for liquidation, understatement of affected accounts, and the validity and propriety of the transactions could not be established.

	We recommended and the Management agreed to:

	

a)	Require the Accountable Officers to immediately liquidate the outstanding cash advances;



b)	Direct the Accountant of the Batad Campus to make the necessary corrections on the cancelled check of the cash advance;



c)	Inform the accountable officers of their accountability for cash advances granted under their name and of their obligation to strictly settle/liquidate the cash advances within the prescribed period pursuant to Section 89 of P.D. No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002;



d)	When warranted, assign bonded Disbursing Officers for departments with PPAs requiring substantial cash advances for a more efficient release and liquidation of the cash advances;

e)	Direct the Accountants to ensure completeness, validity and legality of the supporting documents on the grant of cash advances;



f)	Direct the Accountants to send demand letters, notices or reminders to the officers/employees with overdue cash advances for the immediate submission of liquidation reports supported by necessary documentary requirements; and



g)	Direct the Accountants to withhold the salaries for non-compliance with the demand letters, notices or reminders issued to officers/employees concerned.

			

4)			Disbursements for COVID-19 Hazard Pay in the total amount of P1.427 million lacked complete supporting documents contrary to Budget Circular (BC) No. 2020-001 dated March 24, 2020, thus, the legality and propriety of the transactions could not be established.

	

	We recommended and the Management agreed to:

	

a)	Direct the Accountants to submit the lacking supporting documents on the grant of the COVID-19 hazard pay to substantiate the conditions of the grant set forth in BC No. 2020-001; and



b)	Evaluate properly the necessity of physically reporting to work during the pandemic, for the safety of all personnel in compliance with CHED COVID Advisories.



5)			Unserviceable properties of P3.748 million were not disposed of, contrary to GAM Volume I, Chapter 10, Section 40, thus, exposing the said properties to further deterioration and decrease in value.

		

	We recommended and the Management agreed to:

	

a)	Prepare a work plan with timelines and persons responsible to facilitate the disposal of the unserviceabl6e properties;



b)	Create or reform the Disposal Committee for each campus that would inspect and appraise the properties and recommend the manner of disposal of the same, if found unserviceable;



c)	Direct the Disposal Committee to prepare and update the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property in accordance with the form prescribed on Appendix 74 of GAM, Volume II; 



d)	Provide ample space for the storage of the unserviceable properties while awaiting disposal; and



e)	Require the Inspection and Disposal Committee to immediately dispose the unserviceable properties in the presence of the COA Auditors and under the supervision of the proper committee.
