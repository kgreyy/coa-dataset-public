EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Philippine Normal University (PNU), initially known as the Philippine 

Normal School (PNS), was founded on September 1, 1901 through Act No. 74 of the 

Philippine Commission.  It was the first institution of higher learning organized during 

the American regime. 

 

The PNS was converted into the Philippine Normal College (PNC) on June 18, 

1949.  On July 22, 1972, PNC was authorized by law to offer advanced degrees – Doctor 

of Philosophy and Doctor of Education – and other academic programs relevant to the 

training of teachers, school supervisors, administrators, researchers and other educational 

specialists. It became a full-fledged university on December 26, 1991 under                

Republic Act (RA) No. 7168 and has since then became the PNU as it is now called.  

 

The PNU Main Campus is located in Manila and at present has four provincial 

campuses located in: Alicia, Isabela (PNU North Luzon); Lopez, Quezon (PNU South 

Luzon); Cadiz, Negros Occidental (PNU Visayas); and Prosperidad, Agusan del Sur                    

(PNU Mindanao).  The governance of the institution rests on its Board of Regents (BOR).  

Policies are laid down by the Board and the observance and implementation of such are 

vested on the Office of the President, Dr.  Bert J. Tuga and is assisted by four Vice 

Presidents (VPs), namely, as follows:

As the flagship national university for teacher education, the PNU is dedicated to 

the modernization of the system of continuing education and training of Filipino teachers. 

While it uses its institutional resources creatively, it ensures social equity of access and 

engages in supportive curriculum improvement and innovations in efficient delivery of 

educational services to be able to produce an “EMPOWERED” teacher, which 

represents: 
 

Exercises effective communication 

Manifests professional competence 

Possesses adequate knowledge of the discipline 

Observes professional ethics 

Welcomes progressive innovation and change 

Exhibits a deep sense of nationalism with global perspective 

Radiates a caring attitude for others 

Engages in research for problem solving and decision-making 

Demonstrates personal integrity 
 

On June 30, 2009, The PNU was designated as the Country’s National Center for 

Teacher Education (NCTE) by virtue of RA No. 9647, the PNU Modernization Act of 

2009, in cognizance of the policy of the state to give priority to the continuing 

professional training and development of all Filipino teachers.  Thus, it is mandated to 

provide technical support to the Department of Education (DepEd) and Commission on 

Higher Education (CHED) in their programs and projects on teacher training, teacher 

education, continuing professional education of teachers and academic supervisors and 

teacher education curricula: build and develop a database of education policies to serve as 

a resource to the country’s policy makers; conduct researches, cases studies and other 

appropriate methodologies to enhance curriculum and training designs for teacher 

training, teacher education and continuing professional education of teachers and 

academic supervisors; as may be directed by Congress, provide assistance to legislators 

in the design and analysis of legislative proposals concerning teacher training, teacher 

education, continuing professional education of teachers and academic supervisors, 

teacher education curricula, and other issues affecting teacher education.

Under RA No. 10931, also known as the “Universal Access to Quality Tertiary 

Education Act of 2017,” PNU Campuses are currently providing access to its quality 

tertiary education with free tuition fee and other school fees for students qualified therein. 

 

Amidst the lockdown brought about by the COVID-19 virus, the School Year 

2020-2021 still operated and started in September 2020. The students have their classes 

online while the employees report for work, upon easing the community quarantine 

measures from Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) to General Community 

Quarantine (GCQ), whilst observing the safety protocols provided by the Inter-Agency 

Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Disease.

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the review of the accounts and operations of the PNU-

Manila/Main Campus and the four Provincial Campuses, namely: PNU-North Luzon, 

PNU-South Luzon, PNU-Visayas, and PNU-Mindanao and to a limited extent, their 

reported accomplishments for CY 2020. The audit was conducted to (a) ascertain the 

level of assurance that may be placed on the Management’s assertions on the financial 

statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance 

on the applicable laws, rules and regulations; and (c) determine the extent of 

implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations. 

 

 

E. Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered a Qualified Opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements of the PNU for CY 2020 due to errors and omissions resulting in the 

misstatements aggregating ₱134,938,528.54, of the Receivables, Inventories, Property, 

Plant and Equipment, Other Assets, Liabilities and Expenses accounts of the PNU 

System, as stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report and discussed in detail in Part II of 

this Report. 

 

 

F. Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the significant audit observations and recommendations, which 

are discussed in detail in Part II of this Report: 

 

1. PNU System’s consolidated financial statements (FSs) are materially misstated by 
₱134,938,528.54 on account of errors, omissions and improper accounting 

treatment of transactions pertaining to Receivables, Inventories, Property, Plant 

and Equipment, Other Assets, Liabilities and Expenses accounts that are 

considered as departures from the International Public Sector Accounting 

Standards (IPSAS),  thus the accuracy, classification, completeness and the fair 

presentation of their balances in the consolidated FSs as at December 31, 2020 

could not be relied upon. (Observation No. 1) 

 



vii 

 

We recommended and the Management agreed to: 

 

Misstatements in Receivables Account  

 

PNU-North Luzon 

a. record the adjusting entries to recognize the loss of books and set up 

the liability of the AO in the books of accounts in the amount of 

₱209,512.30. Likewise, the AO is advised to submit the request for 

relief from accountability and the documentary requirements thereon 

for our evaluation pursuant to Section 11, Chapter 8 of the GAM for 

NGAs, Volume I and Section 73 of PD No. 1445;

for NGAs, Volume I;  

 

e. henceforth, consider the residual value in computing the depreciation 
expense of all depreciable PPE; 

 

f. record the adjusting entries to reclassify the Books from PPE account 
to Semi-Expendable Books account of ₱2,126,283.29 and derecognize 

the non-existent books of ₱107,697.66, without prejudice to the 

imposition of liability against the AO for the loss thereof; 

 

PNU-Mindanao 

g. revalue the donated Land at its fair value pursuant to Paragraph 51 
of IPSAS No. 17 and Section 12, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs,    

Volume I; 
 
 



viii 

 

Misstatements in Other Assets-Advances Accounts  

 

PNU-Manila 

h. prepare a JEV adjusting the ₱200,000.00 refund of cash to close the 
PCF of the AO, which was erroneously credited to the Advances to 

Special Disbursing Officers account, with signed JEV furnished to the           

Audit Team; 

 

Misstatements in Liabilities Account  

 

PNU-Manila 

i. revert the long outstanding payables of ₱2,055,561.48 to the 
Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account to reflect the correct balance 

of the Accounts Payable;

documents to support reversion of the Accounts Payable;  

 

PNU-Mindanao

No. 87, series of 2019; 

 

PNU-North Luzon  

l. revert the undocumented Other Payables under the STF and TF to

Misstatements in Expenses Account  

 

PNU-North Luzon 

m. record the adjusting entries to recognize the issuance of semi-
expendable properties of ₱4,686,729.45. 

 

 

2. The Receivables account totaling ₱458,131,806.27 of PNU-Manila campus is 
unreliable, consisting of overdue receivables of ₱450,891,576.34, and has the 

following deficiencies: a) non-provision of Allowance for Impairment  for 

Accounts Receivables aged two years and above without details of  

₱5,204,681.53; b) unsupported receivables aged one  to less than 10 years of  

₱1,045,301.26; c) Loans Receivables - Others, Due from NGAs and Other 

Receivables accounts balances which remained in the books of accounts for 10 

years or more  totaling  ₱9,048,191.52; d) unaccounted balances of ₱6,795,204.71 

due to the migration of accounts to the new e-NGAS; and e) misclassification of 



ix 

 

Receivables accounts pertaining to claims from employees  amounting to  

₱1,027,893.02. (Observation No. 2.c) 
 

We recommended that PNU-Manila: 
 

a. formulate/establish guidelines in the provision of allowance for 
doubtful accounts that are based on factors such as aging of accounts 

and collectability pursuant to Section 10, Chapter 7 of the GAM for 

NGAs, Volume I; 
 

b. enforce collections of Accounts Receivable, thru sending of Demand 
Letters to the debtors, especially those duly supported with valid 

documents; 
 

c. monitor the utilization and liquidation of fund transfers and 
compliance by the concerned NGAs with the reporting requirements 

and send Demand Letters to defaulting recipients requiring the 

immediate settlement of all unliquidated fund transfers and the 

return of any excess; 
 

d. demand settlement of overdue accounts and after exhausting all 
means, request an authority for write-off of the dormant accounts 

from COA following the guidelines prescribed under COA Circular 

No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 in order to clear the books of 

long outstanding inactive balances; 
 

e. look for the details of the unaccounted balances of ₱6,795,204.71 and 
prepare the necessary adjustment; 

 

f. intensify efforts to locate and communicate with the former personnel 
with outstanding balances and take appropriate action(s) to collect the 

said receivables; 
 

g. reclassify the AR and Other Receivable accounts with balances of 
₱11,520.00 and ₱1,016,373.02, respectively, to Due from Officers and 

Employees account to properly record the claims from active 

employees; 
 

h. take actions to settle the ₱1,027,893.02 collectible from active PNU 
employees; and 

 

i. require officials and employees to secure clearance from money and 
property accountability from heads of concerned Offices before 

resignation/separation or retirement to ensure that all outstanding 

cash advances are settled. Moreover, hold liable all signatories of said 

clearance in the event accountable officials/employees are allowed to 

resign or retire without settling their dues and unliquidated cash 

advances. 



x 

 

3. The accuracy, existence and valuation of the reported PPE accounts in the total 
amount of ₱638,475,342.81 cannot be ascertained due to the discrepancy of 

₱42,997,149.12 between the books and the RPCPPE of PNU-Manila and PNU-

South Luzon and the non-submission of the RPCPPE of PNU-Visayas and PNU-

Mindanao to substantiate the PPE book balances totaling ₱125,550,751.85. 

(Observation No. 2.f) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

PNU-Manila 

a. thru the Accounting Unit, the Property Unit and Inventory 
Committee, conduct analysis of PPE accounts vis-à-vis the RPCPPE 

and other property records to identify and clear the reconciling items; 

 

b. prepare the necessary journal entries to adjust the duly identified 
details of the reconciling items, in order to reflect the correct account 

balances;  

 

c. perform periodic reconciliation of property records between the 
Accounting Unit and Property Unit to timely identify any discrepancy 

for adjustment of both records;  

 

PNU-South Luzon 

d. thru its Accounting staff and the Supply and Property Officer, exhaust 
all means to account for the huge difference noted between the 

RPCPPE and the Accounting records to arrive at reliable balances of 

PPE accounts; 

 

PNU-Mindanao 

e. thru its Inventory Committee, prioritize the conduct of physical count 
of Inventory and PPE and prepare the RPCPPE, to comply with its 

submission as prescribed;  

 

f. properly plan/organize the conduct of physical inventory-taking to 
ascertain the existence, completeness and condition of all PPEs owned 

by PNU-Mindanao and comply with the guidelines and procedures 

prescribed in COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020; 

 

PNU-Visayas 

g. thru its Accountant and the Supply and/or Property Officer, exert 
efforts for the immediate reconciliation of their respective records in 

order to present fairly the financial position of the Agency and comply 

as soon as possible with the one-time cleansing of PPE account 

balances provided for under COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated 

January 31, 2020; 

 



xi 

 

h. thru its Supply and/or Property Officer, prepare and maintain 
Property Card (PC) for all the PPE accounts and consistently update 

the same; and 

 

i. thru the Inventory Committee, timely accomplish the RPCPPE as at 
yearend and submit the original copy of the report to the Auditor 

concerned, thru the Accounting Unit, not later than January 31 of the 

following year. 

 

 

4. The validity of the Due to NGAs account with yearend balance of ₱58,730,022.48 
cannot be ascertained due to inclusion of funds (a) for inactive research projects 

which should have been returned by PNU to the Source Agencies/grantors 

amounting to ₱16,417,578.42, of which ₱4,228,144.32 has no details on the fund 

source/transferring entities; (b) with unknown source/without supporting 

documents amounting to ₱2,371,277.31; and (c) with abnormal/negative balances 

of ₱1,138,249.24. (Observation No. 2.i) 

 

We recommended that Management of PNU-Manila, thru the University 

Accountant: 

 

a. revert to the National Treasury the unrefunded, dormant, and 
unnecessary trust fund of ₱16,417,578.42 and provide OR(s) of the 

reversion and JEV to the identified Source Agencies for information 

and appropriate action, copy furnished the Audit Team;  

 

b. furnish the Audit Team with the MOA undertaken by the University 
with Teresita Aquino-Oreta amounting to ₱2,450,474.44 for further 

review; and 

 

c. reconcile the balances of all accounts under Due to NGAs giving 
priority to those with negative balances. 

 

 

5. Out of ₱172,750,003.05 Cash NT-MDS transferred by PNU-Manila to the CIB- 
LCCA of PNU-Mindanao and PNU-North Luzon campuses for their operating 

requirements, ₱32,323,562.02 remained unutilized and unreverted to the Bureau 

of the Treasury (BTr). Furthermore, the ₱5,269,143.27 which was deposited by 

PNU-Mindanao to the STF account of PNU Manila in CY 2019 is still unremitted 

to the BTr, contrary to existing laws, rules and regulations resulting in the 

accumulation of idle funds that could have been utilized for other government 

programs. (Observation No. 5)

We recommended that Management: 

 

PNU-Manila 

a. initiate action to ensure the opening of MDS Account by the campuses 
for the direct downloading of funds for their operational 

requirements thru Notice of Transfer of Cash Allocation instead of 

thru funding checks deposited in the LCCA account; 
 

b. revert to the BTr the ₱5,269,143.27 funds transferred by PNU- 
Mindanao to its STF account, with certified thru copy of the 

documents evidencing deposit made furnished that Campus and the 

Audit Team; 

 

PNU-Mindanao 

c. coordinate with PNU-Manila on the opening of MDS Account and 
request from PNU-Manila a certified copy of the deposit made to the 

BTr relative to the reversion/remittance of ₱5,269,143.27 funds 

transferred thru their STF account; 
 

d. thru its Accountant, remit to the BTr, not to PNU Manila, the 
unexpended fund balance, in compliance with Section 10, General 

Provisions of GAA for FY 2020 (RA No. 11465); and 

 

PNU-North Luzon 

e. thru the Accountant, return the unutilized and idle funds amounting 
to ₱12,960,496.42 to the BTr pursuant to EO No. 431 dated May 30, 

2005, COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015 and

6. Audit of PNU-Manila STF budget disclosed the following: a) unutilized budget of 
₱37,277,929.32 or equivalent to 53.39 percent of its ₱69,825,622.01 CY 2020 

approved STF budget;  b) minimal budget allotted for the repairs/rehabilitation of 

the school buildings, thus was not responsive to the needs of the students for 

improved facilities; b) non-utilization of the allocated research fund and extension 

projects in combined amount of  ₱2,499,000.00, indicating a setback in the 

delivery of research and extension services; and c) minimal utilization of only 

₱4,397,978.02 or 27.29 percent of budget allocation for Fiduciary Fund of 

₱16,113,077.58, thereby, defeating the intended purposes for the collection 

thereof. (Observation No. 11) 

 

We recommended that Management:  
 

a. observe set timelines in the implementation and completion of 
plans/programs and activities to ensure effective delivery of services, 

as required under Section 24 of the CMO No. 20, series of 2011;

b. prioritize the needs and safety of the students by allocating resources 
for the rehabilitation of school buildings and other facilities to 

enhance effective delivery of services; and 
 

c. maximize utilization of the STF to ensure accomplishment of the 
University’s major functions not only on instruction but also on 

research and extension services.
