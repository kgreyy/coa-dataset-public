PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

Accounting Errors, Omissions and Misstatements 

 

1. The Philippine Normal University (PNU) System’s consolidated financial 
statements (FSs) are materially misstated by ₱134,938,528.54 on account of 

errors, omissions and improper accounting treatment of transactions pertaining 

to Receivables, Inventories, Property, Plant and Equipment, Other Assets, 

Liabilities and Expenses accounts that are considered as departures from the 

International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS),  thus the accuracy, 

classification, completeness and the fair presentation of their balances in the 

consolidated FSs as of December 31, 2020 could not be relied upon. 

 

1.1. Section 15, Chapter 2, of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 
National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, requires that “The 

Financial Statements (FSs) shall present fairly the financial position, 

financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation 

requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events 

and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for 

assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses set out in the Philippine Public 

Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS)1”. 

 

Moreover, Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that 

the accounts of the agency shall be kept in such detail as necessary to meet 

the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the 

information needed by the fiscal or control agencies of the government. 

 

1.2. The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be 
observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or 

misleading information. 

 

1.3. The audit of the PNU System’s consolidated FSs disclosed the following 
misstatements/errors in several of its accounts which affected the fair 

presentation of the reported total Assets, Liabilities and Expenses of the 

Agency, as shown below:

Misstatements in Receivables - ₱209,512.30 

 

1.4. The following are the misstatements found in the audit of Receivables 
account, which the Management did not adjust in their books:

1.a. The Due from Officers and Employees account was not set up to 
recognize the receivable from the Accountable Officer (AO) who failed 

to file a request for relief from accountability for the loss of issued books 

amounting to ₱209,512.30. 



47 

 

1.5. Section 11, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I states that 
“Accountability over Semi-Expendable Property. Inventory Custodian Slip 

(ICS) (Appendix 59) shall be issued to end-user of Semi-Expendable Property 

to establish accountability over them. Accountability shall be extinguished 

upon return of the item to the Property and Supply Division/Unit or in case 

of loss, upon approval of the relief from property accountability.” 

 

1.6. Section 73 of PD No. 1445 provides that “When a loss of government funds 
or property occurs while they are in transit or the loss is caused by fire, theft, 

or other casualty or force majeure, the officer accountable therefor or having 

custody thereof shall immediately notify the Commission or the auditor 

concerned and, within thirty days or such longer period as the Commission 

or auditor may in the particular case allow, shall present his application for 

relief, with the available supporting evidence. Whenever warranted by the 

evidence credit for the loss shall be allowed. An officer who fails to comply 

with this requirement shall not be relieved of liability or allowed credit for 

any loss in the settlement of his accounts.”  

 

1.7. Issued books to the University Librarian of PNU-North Luzon amounting to 
₱209,512.30 were lost. The Audit Team was not notified of the loss and the 

AO did not submit any formal request for relief from accountability and the 

related documentary requirements required under COA Memorandum No. 

1992-751 dated February 24, 1992. In addition, the liability of the AO 

equivalent to the cost of books was not set up. 

 

1.8. We recommended, and the PNU-North Luzon Management agreed, thru 
the Accountant, to record the adjusting entries to recognize the loss of 

books and set up the liability of the AO in the books of accounts in the 

amount of ₱209,512.30. Likewise, the AO is advised to submit the 

request for relief from accountability and the documentary 

requirements thereon for our evaluation pursuant to Section 11, Chapter 

8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I and Section 73 of PD No. 1445. 

 

1.9. Management explained that in CY 2003, a number of books were lost 
because only a designated faculty and student assistants managed the library. 

However, only some of the declared lost books were retrieved. 

Unfortunately, from CY 2004 until now, the library is still experiencing 

losses as the assigned Librarian cannot monitor the ins and outs of books at 

all times especially when attending to official business and only student 

assistants were assigned to man the library temporarily. As a solution, the 

campus implemented the use of Destiny Library Manager (DLM) to reduce 

the loss of books as the monitoring is done through a bar coding system. In 

addition, a CCTV will be installed to protect the library resources from 

possible theft and unauthorized release of books.

1.10. The Librarian will submit the Request for relief from accountability and the 
documentary requirements thereon. 

 

 

INVENTORIES 

 

Misstatements in Inventories account - ₱122,039.60 

 

1.11. The following are the misstatements found in the audit of Inventories account 
of PNU-North Luzon which affected the fair presentation of the account in

1.b. Semi-expendable medical equipment amounting to ₱642,212.00 were 
recorded twice, resulting in the overstatement of the Inventories 

account, contrary to Section 15, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, 

Volume I on the fair presentation of the FSs as of December 31, 2020. 
 

1.12. Report on the Physical Count of Semi-Expendable Properties and Books 
revealed that ₱4,686,729.45 had been issued to the end-users. However, 

Accounting records disclosed that there was a double recording of semi-

expendable medical equipment amounting to ₱642,212.00, resulting in the 
overstatement of the aforesaid account. 

 



49 

 

1.13. We recommended, and the PNU-North Luzon Management agreed, thru 
the Accountant, to record the adjusting entries to correct the double 

recording of semi-expendable medical equipment in the Inventories 

account amounting to ₱642,212.00. 
 

 

Non-recording of unused inventory initially recorded as Expenses 

 

1.c. Inventories were directly recorded as expense by PNU-North Luzon 
upon purchase and no adjustments were recorded despite the available 

information presented in the Report on the Physical Count of 

Inventories (RPCI) at yearend, thus resulting in the misstatement of 

assets and expenses amounting to ₱520,172.40. 
 

1.14. Section 7, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that: 
 

“Sec. 7. Recognition as an Expense. When inventories are sold, 

exchanged, or distributed, their carrying amount shall be recognized 

as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. 

If there is no related revenue, the expense is recognized when the 

goods are distributed or the related service is rendered.  
 

The amount of any write-down to net realizable value and all losses of 

inventories shall be recognized as an expense in the period the write-

down or loss occurs. Reversal of any write-down of inventories arising 

from increase in net realizable value shall be recognized as a 

reduction in the amount of inventories recognized as an expense in the 

period in which the reversal occurs.” (Par. 44, IPSAS 12) 
 

1.15. Evaluation on the RPCI as at yearend revealed that there were undistributed 
supplies and materials amounting to ₱618,038.38 in the custody of the 

Supply Officer. However, the Inventories accounts in the Trial Balance as of 

December 31, 2020 presented a total of only ₱97,865.98. Details are      

shown below:

1.16. Inquiry with the Supply Officer disclosed that the Office Supplies and 
Construction Materials Inventories were purchased prior to CY 2020 while 

the Other Supplies and Materials Inventory was purchased in CY 2020, both 

were directly charged to Repairs and Maintenance-Buildings and Other 

Structures account. 

 

1.17. Despite the conduct of physical count and the availability of the report 
thereon, the Accountant did not record any adjustment in the books of 

accounts at yearend relative to the noted discrepancy, hence understating the 

balance of Inventories account by ₱520,172.40. It is emphasized that 

purchases of supplies and materials shall be initially recorded to Inventory 

account and the related expense be only recognized upon issuance except for 

supplies and materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on 

emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense 

accounts.  

 

1.18. We recommended, and PNU-North Luzon agreed, thru the Accountant, 
to adjust in the books the procured inventories which were erroneously 

charged to Repairs and Maintenance – Buildings and Other Structures 

account in the amount of ₱520,172.40.    

 

 

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PPE) 

 

Misstatements in PPE accounts - ₱121,121,738.94 

 

1.19. The reported total balance of PPE accounts as of December 31, 2020 was 
misstated by ₱121,121,738.94 due to the following errors and omissions:

Overstatement of Accumulated Depreciation due to non-recognition of residual 

value 

 

1.d. Accumulated Depreciation of the related PPE accounts of the PNU-
North Luzon was misstated by ₱3,200,077.24 due to the non-recognition 

of residual value in the computation of depreciation, contrary to Section 

27, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I.  
 

1.20. Section 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that: 
 

“PPE gradually loses its ability to provide service over the course of 

time. Because of this, its cost needs to be distributed on a systematic 

basis over its useful life. The allocated cost is referred to as 

depreciation. The depreciation charge for each period shall be 

recognized as expense unless it is included in the carrying amount of 

another asset. For example, the depreciation of manufacturing plant 

and equipment is included in the costs of conversion of inventories. 

Similarly, depreciation of PPE used for development activities may be 

included in the cost of an intangible asset recognized. The following 

are policies regarding depreciation of PPE:  

 

a. There are three factors an entity must consider in determining 
depreciation:  

 

1. Initial cost,  

2. Useful life, and  

3. Expected residual value at the end of its useful life. 

 

xxx 

 

c. Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such 
as when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be 

capable of operating in the manner intended by management. For 

simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, depreciation 

shall be for one month if the PPE is available for use on or before 

the 15th of the month. However, if the PPE is available for use 

after the 15th of the month, depreciation starts on the succeeding 

month. 

 

xxx 

 

i. A residual value equivalent to at least five percent (5%) of the cost 
shall be adopted unless a more appropriate percentage is 

determined by the entity based on its operation subject to the 

approval of COA. 

 



53 

 

j. The residual value and the useful life of an asset shall be reviewed 
at least at each annual reporting date and, if expectations differ 

from previous estimates, the change(s) shall be accounted for as a 

change in an accounting estimate in accordance with Chapter 19-

Financial Reporting of this Manual. 

 

k. The computation of monthly depreciation expense shall be as 
follows: Depreciation Expense =     Cost – Residual Value             

    Estimated Useful Life (in months)” 

 

1.21. In addition, Section 2.l, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I defines 
residual value as “the equivalent to at least five percent (5%) of the cost of 

an asset that the entity would currently obtain from disposal of the asset, 

after deducting the estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already of 

the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life, unless a 

more appropriate percentage is determined by an entity based on their 

operation.” 

 

1.22. The disclosure in the Notes to Financial Statements of the Agency presented 
that: 

 

“Land is not depreciated.  Depreciation on other assets is charged so 

as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual values over their 

estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method. A residual value 

computed at 10 percent of the cost of asset is set and depreciation 

starts on the second month after purchase. The estimated useful lives 

range as follows: 

 

Property classification  Estimated useful life 

Buildings and Other Structures  30-50 years 

Machinery and Equipment  5-10 years 

Transportation Equipment  10-15 years 

Furniture and Fixtures and Books  10-15 years 

 

If there is an indication that there has been a significant change in 

depreciation rate, useful life or residual value of an asset, the 

depreciation of that asset is revised prospectively to reflect the new 

expectations.” 

 

1.23. The Agency’s policy as disclosed in the Notes to FSs clearly considered the 
residual value of the PPE in the determination of depreciation. 

Miscalculation of depreciation leads to misstatement in the FSs of the 

Agency which could mislead users thereof. 

 

1.24. Evaluation of the Schedule of PPE revealed that the Accountant erroneously 
computed the depreciation expense wherein the 10 percent residual value was 



54 

 

omitted in the determination of depreciable amount. In addition, records 

show that book value of fully depreciated PPE is zero which is also caused 

by non-recognition of residual value, thus an overstatement of Accumulated 

Depreciation amounting to ₱3,200,077.26 was noted, as summarized below:

1.25. We recommended, and PNU-North Luzon Management agreed to: 
 

a. record the adjusting entries to take up Depreciation Expense and 
Accumulated Depreciation at ₱433,036.77 and ₱3,200,077.24, 

respectively, to include the residual value in the computation of 

depreciation of PPE pursuant to Section 27, Chapter 10 of the 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and 

 

b. henceforth, consider the residual value in computing the 
depreciation expense of all depreciable PPE. 

 

 

Erroneous classification and non-existent Books of PNU-North Luzon 

 

1.e. The Books account of PNU-North Luzon amounting to ₱2,233,980.95 
consisted of items worth ₱2,126,283.29 with individual values less than 

the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 but recorded as PPE while 

items worth ₱107,697.66 were non-existent, thus resulting in the 

misstatement of the FSs. 

 



55 

 

1.26. Section 10, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that: 
 

“Tangible items below the capitalization threshold of ₱15,000 shall be 

accounted as semi-expendable property. The following policies apply, 

as follows:  

 

a. Semi-expendable property which were recognized as PPE shall 
be reclassified to the affected accounts.  

b. These tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon issue 
to the end-user. 

 

1.27. The PNU-North Luzon Accountant recorded the Books as part of PPE 
amounting to ₱2,233,980.95 with Accumulated Depreciation of ₱786,802.65 

but physical count disclosed that only ₱2,126,283.29 was accounted for by 

the University Librarian. The said books did not qualify individually with the 

capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 in order to be recognized as PPE. 

While the remaining ₱107,697.66 is said to be non-existent, hence should be 

derecognized in the books.  

 

1.28. We recommended, and the PNU-North Luzon agreed, thru the 
Accountant, to record the adjusting entries to reclassify the Books from 

PPE account to Semi-Expendable Books account of ₱2,126,283.29 and 

derecognize the non-existent books of ₱107,697.66, without prejudice to 

the imposition of liability against the AO for the loss thereof. 
 

 

Undervalued Land of PNU-Mindanao 

 

1.f. The land donated to PNU-Mindanao was not recorded using the fair 
value of the asset, contrary to Section 12, Chapter 10 of the GAM for 

NGAs, Volume 1, thereby understating the Land account by 

₱119,368,840.00 and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account by the    

same amount. 

 

1.29. Section 12, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I prescribes that for 
Donation without Condition, the cost of PPE acquired through donation 

without condition shall be taken up at its fair value at the date it is acquired.  

All expenses incurred in connection with the donated asset, such as delivery 

and installation costs, shall be included in the amount recognized as asset.  

The fair value of the PPE shall be recognized as “Income from Grants and 

Donations in Kind.” 

 

1.30. Paragraph 44 of IPSAS No. 17 states: 
 

“After recognition of an asset, an item of PPE whose fair value can be 

measured reliably shall be carried at a revalued amount, being its fair 



56 

 

value at the date of the revaluation, less any subsequent accumulated 

depreciation, and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.  

Revaluation shall be made with sufficient regularity to ensure that the 

carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be 

determined using fair value at the reporting date.” 

 

1.31. Further, Paragraph 51 thereof provides that if an item of PPE is revalued, the 
entire class of PPE to which that asset belongs shall be revalued. 

 

1.32. Verification of the Land account of PNU-Mindanao showed that a total of 
₱11,875,730.00 was recorded by the Campus as of December 31, 2020.  

However, scrutiny of the Tax Declaration documents revealed that the fair 

value of such Land amounted to ₱131,244,570.00, thereby resulting in the 

undervaluation of Land account by ₱119,368,840.00, as shown below:

1.33. Inquiry with the Accountant disclosed that she was not aware of the basis in 
recording the Land and that she also has no copy of the latest Tax 

Declaration to support the recognition of the land revaluation based on the 

fair value.  The Accountant assured that she will verify the Tax Declaration. 

 

1.34. It is emphasized that the valuation of PPE particularly Land, can be revalued, 
pursuant to Paragraph 51 of IPSAS No. 17 in order to fairly present the value 

of the donated Land in the FSs. 

 

1.35. The non-revaluation of the Land to its fair value understated the Land 
account and its related Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account by 

₱119,368,840.00 as at yearend. 

 

1.36. We recommended, and Management agreed, thru the Accountant, to 
revalue the donated Land at its fair value pursuant to Paragraph 51 of 

IPSAS No. 17 and Section 12, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs,       

Volume I.

Misstatements in Other Assets - Advances account - ₱200,000.00 
 

1.37. The reported total balance of Advances accounts as of December 31, 2020 
was misstated by ₱200,000.00 due to the erroneous entry in closing the petty 

cash fund.

PNU-Manila’s misclassification of refund intended to close Petty Cash Fund 

 

1.g. The Advances to Special Disbursing Officers account of PNU-Manila is 
understated by ₱200,000.00 due to an erroneous credit entry made 

intended to close the Petty Cash Fund (PCF). 

 

1.38. Ms. Jenny C. Malitao returned the cash amounting to ₱200,000.00 under 
Official Receipt (OR) No. 601010 and was recorded under JEV No. 2020-12-

001225 with both documents dated December 18, 2020. The return of cash 

was intended to close the PCF provided to her as the former Cafeteria 

Director, which was inadvertently credited in the Advances to Special 

Disbursing Officers account instead of the Petty Cash Fund account. The 

erroneous entry resulted in a reduced balance of the Advances to Special 

Disbursing Officers account and overstated the Petty Cash Fund account in 

the amount of ₱200,000.00.  

 

1.39. We recommended that PNU-Manila prepare a JEV adjusting the 
₱200,000.00 refund of cash to close the PCF of the AO, which was 

erroneously credited to the Advances to Special Disbursing Officers 

account, with signed JEV furnished to the Audit Team. 

 

1.40. Management commented that the Accounting Unit (AU) already rectified the 
error under JEV No. 2021-01-000127 dated February 23, 2021.  

 

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 

 

Misstatements in Financial Liabilities accounts - ₱8,598,508.25 

 

1.41. The reported total balance of Financial Liabilities as of December 31, 2020 
was overstated by ₱8,598,508.25 due to the following errors:

Non-reversion of PNU-Manila’s and PNU-Mindanao’s payables which are 

outstanding for more than two years 

 

1.h. Accounts Payable of ₱2,055,945.87 and ₱1,392,893.12 of PNU-Manila 
and PNU-Mindanao, respectively, and ₱228,050.54 under the Due to 

Officers and Employees account of PNU-Mindanao were outstanding for 

two years and above and were not reverted to the Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) account, consequently overstating the Payables 

account, contrary to Section 98 of PD No. 1445 and EO No. 87, thus the 

accuracy, valuation and obligations, and fair presentation of the FSs 

cannot be relied upon. 

 

1.42. Section 98 of PD No. 1445 provides for the reversion of unliquidated 
balances of Accounts Payable, which states that: “The Commission, upon 

notice to the head of agency concerned, may revert to the unappropriated 

surplus of the general fund of the national government, any unliquidated 

balance of accounts payable in the books of the national government, which 

has been outstanding for two years or more and against which no actual 

claim, administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by 

perfected contracts on record.” (Emphasis supplied) 

 

1.43. Section 1 of Executive Order (EO) No. 87 dated August 13, 2019 requires 
that: 

 

“Reversion of Undocumented Accounts Payable. All documented 

Accounts Payable for fiscal year 2016 and years prior thereto shall be 

reverted to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund, or 

Cumulative Result of Operations of the National Government. 



59 

 

Henceforth, all documented accounts payable which remain 

outstanding for at least two years, for which no actual administrative 

or judicial claim has been filed, shall be subject to automatic 

reversion.” (Emphasis supplied) 

 

1.44. Accounts Payable of PNU-Manila and PNU-Mindanao amounting to 
₱2,055,945.87 and ₱1,392,893.12, respectively, and Due to Officers and 

Employees account of PNU-Mindanao totaling ₱228,050.54 remained 

outstanding in the books despite ageing for more than two years, thus 

overstating the Payables accounts of the PNU System by ₱3,676,889.53. 

 

1.45. By virtue of the above-cited laws, the outstanding amount of ₱3,676,889.53 
aged two years and above should have been automatically reverted at 

yearend. Consequently, the non-compliance therewith resulted in the 

overstatement of the Accounts Payable account by ₱3,448,838.99 and the 

Due to Officers and Employees account by ₱228,050.54 while understating 

the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account by the total of ₱3,676,889.53. 

 

1.46. We recommended and the Management agreed to: 
 

PNU-Manila 

a. revert the long outstanding payables of ₱2,055,561.48 to the 
Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account to reflect the correct 

balance of the Accounts Payable; 

 

b. provide the Audit Team with the signed JEV and supporting 
documents to support reversion of the Accounts Payable; and 

 

PNU-Mindanao 

c. thru the Accountant, verify the recorded amounts and revert to 
the General Fund the outstanding payables for two years or more 

of creditors, retired, resigned and transferred employees pursuant 

to EO No. 87, series of 2019. 

 

1.47. The Management’s comments are as follows: 
 

Management’s Comments 

PNU-Manila 

The Management of PNU-Manila stated that the Accounting Unit will adhere to the 

recommendations of COA. Furthermore, the ₱2,055,561.48 has been adjusted under 

JEV 2021-03-000353 dated March 29, 2021. 

PNU-Mindanao 

The Management conveyed that the balances of Accounts Payable are still subject to 

reconciliation.  Letter of final demand will be sent to the concerned individuals to 

process whatever requirements are needed for the release of their claims, otherwise, 

the Accountant will be directed to revert the fund in compliance with the EO.

Undocumented Other Payables of PNU-North Luzon  

 

1.i. Other Payables recorded from CYs 2015-2017 in the STF and Trust 
Fund (TF) in the total amount of ₱4,921,618.72 were not supported with 

valid documents or perfected contracts, thus corresponding funds 

remain idle and hampers the determination of actual financial condition 

of the Agency, contrary to Section 2 of EO No. 87 dated August 13, 2019 

and Sections 37 and 55, Chapters 1 and 19, respectively, both of the 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

1.48. Section 2 of EO No. 87, series of 2019 provides that: 
 

“All accounts payable which are undocumented or not covered by 

perfected contracts on record, regardless of the year in which they 

were incurred, shall automatically be reverted. The recording of 

undocumented accounts payable in the books of accounts of agencies 

shall be strictly prohibited.” 

 

1.49. Section 37, Chapter 1 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that: 
 

“Certification of Availability of Funds. No funds shall be disbursed, 

and no expenditures or obligations chargeable against any authorized 

allotment shall be incurred or authorized in any department, office or 

agency without first securing the certification of its Chief Accountant 

or head of accounting unit as to the availability of funds and the 

allotment to which the expenditure or obligation may be properly 

charged.  

 

No obligation shall be certified to accounts payable unless the 

obligation is founded on a valid claim that is properly supported by 

sufficient evidence and unless there is proper authority for its 

incurrence. Any certification for a non-existent or fictitious obligation 

and/or creditor shall be considered void. The certifying official shall 

be dismissed from the service, without prejudice to criminal 

prosecution under the provisions of the Revised Penal Code. Any 

payment made under such certification shall be illegal and every 

official authorizing or making such payment, or taking part therein or 

receiving such payment, shall be jointly and severally liable to the 

government for the full amount so paid or received.”  

 

1.50. The Agency is maintaining two funds, namely, the STF and TF for the 
collection of fees and disbursement of expenditures. The utilization of these 

funds is subject to the approval of the Board of Regents (BOR). In some 

instances, the Agency collects or receives funds for various purposes such as 

scholarships, Licensure Examination for Teachers (LET) review and 

international research conference which were credited to Other Payables 



61 

 

account. However, the expenses related to these activities were not 

consistently charged to the Other Payables account, instead, they were 

recognized as Expenses. The Accountant explained that any excess amount 

from the collection, except for scholarships, will be treated as part of the 

Agency’s fund and not returned to the Payor. Such being the case, the 

recognition of Other Payables upon collection of said fees no longer applies 

but should have been directly recorded as Income. 

 

1.51. Evaluation of the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) of Other Payables account under 
the STF and TF revealed that ₱4,921,618.72 remained in the Agency’s 

books, which covered CYs 2015-2017 transactions, as summarized below:

Total 3,497,540.61 1,424,078.11 4,921,618.72 

 

1.52. As can be gleaned from the table above, the payee and nature of the liability 
are not specified. Inquiry with the Accountant disclosed that per Accounting 

record, there is no document or record that will support the liability. Hence, 

in the absence of documents or perfected contracts to support the payment to 

be charged to Other Payables, it is just proper to close the Other Payables 

account under the STF and TF and be made available for operating purposes 

subject to the approval of the BOR. 

 

1.53. We recommended, and PNU-North Luzon Management agreed, thru its 
Accountant, to revert the undocumented Other Payables under the STF 

and TF to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) and be made available for 

operating purposes subject to the approval of the BOR. 

 

 

EXPENSES 

 

Misstatements in Expenses Account - ₱4,686,729.45 

 

1.54. The Expenses account balance presented in the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Performance amounting to ₱568,147,215.64 is understated by a net 

amount ₱4,686,729.45 due to the non-recording of issuances of semi-

expendable equipment, thus, overstating the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit), 

the details are presented below:

were not recorded as Expenses during CY 2020, contrary to Section 7, 

Chapter 8, of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus understated the 

Expenses account. 

 

1.55. The Report on the Physical Count of Semi-Expendable Properties and Books 
revealed that ₱4,686,729.45 had been issued to the end-users, however,

issuances.

Accountant, to record the adjusting entries to recognize the issuance of 

semi-expendable properties of ₱4,686,729.45. 



64 

 

OTHER ACCOUNTING DEFICIENCIES 

 

2. Unresolved variances and huge discrepancies between Accounting records and 
the supporting schedules/documents and unsubstantiated balances in various 

accounts were noted which affected the reliability of the consolidated financial 

statements. 
 

2.1. Section 6, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I enumerated the 
qualitative characteristics of financial reporting, namely, reliability, faithful 

representation and completeness, defined as follows: 
 

“Reliability – reliable information is free from material error and 

bias, and can be depended on by the users to represent faithfully that 

which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to 

represent. 
 

Faithful representation – information to represent faithfully 

transactions and other events, it should be presented in accordance 

with the substance of the transactions and other events, and not merely 

their legal form. 
 

Completeness – the information in FSs should be complete within the 

bounds of materiality and cost.” 
 

2.2. Section 7, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I states that “financial 
statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance 

and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful 

representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in 

accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 

revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs.” 
 

2.3. The following deficiencies in recording and reporting financial transactions 
resulting from lack of reconciliation of Accounting and Property records also 

affected the reliability, accuracy, completeness, and valuation of the reported 

account balances of the FSs.

a. Unreconciled/Undeposited collections 
 

2.a. The Cash-Collecting Officers account with a yearend balance of 
₱529,538.64 includes the accountability of a former Collecting Officer 

(CO) of PNU-Manila which remained unsettled since CY 2011 despite 

being transferred/reassigned in another Division of the University, which 

showed Management’s lack of adherence to the provisions of                              

PD No. 1445, and the Revised Cash Examination Manual. The non-

reconciliation of the outstanding balance of the Cash-Collecting Officers 

account for nine years raised doubts on the reliability, accuracy, and fair 

presentation of the financial statements (FSs). 

 

2.4. PD No. 1445 or the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines states the 
following provisions: 

 

“Section 69. Deposit of moneys in the treasury. (1) Public officers 

authorized to receive and collect moneys arising from taxes, revenues, 

or receipts of any kind shall remit or deposit intact the full amounts so 

received and collected by them to the treasury of the agency concerned 

and credited to the particular accounts to which the said moneys 

belong. 

 

Section 80. Final report of accountable officers. (1) An accountable 

officer, upon ceasing to act in his official capacity as such, shall 

submit to the auditor of the agency concerned a report of his 

accountability. (2) Any remaining balance of such accountability shall 

be deposited in the proper treasury without unnecessary delay. 

 

Section 101. Accountable officers; bond requirements. (1) Every 

officer of any government agency whose duties permit or require the 

possession or custody of government funds or property shall be 

accountable therefor and for the safekeeping thereof in conformity 

with law. (2) Every accountable officer shall be properly bonded in 

accordance with law.” 

 



66 

 

2.5. Furthermore, Chapter 2 of the Revised Cash Examination Manual (Updated 
2013) provides the following, among others: 

 

“7.  An AO shall maintain his cashbook/CRR/CDR/CkDR and such 

other records or their equivalents as may be prescribed by the 

agency’s operating procedures, and reconcile with the accounting 

records at least quarterly, unless the agency requires a more 

frequent reconciliation. 

 

8.  An AO, upon ceasing to act in his official capacity as such, shall 

submit to the auditor of the agency concerned a report of his 

accountability. Any remaining balance of such accountability shall 

be deposited in the proper treasury without unnecessary delay. 

 

20. Except as may otherwise be specifically provided by law or 

competent authority, all moneys and property officially received by 

a public officer in any capacity or upon any occasion must be 

accounted for as government funds and government property. 

 

32. All COs shall deposit intact all their collections, as well as 

collections turned over to them by sub-collectors/tellers, with 

authorized government depository bank (AGDB) daily or not later 

than the next banking day. Where collections are minimal and 

daily deposit thereof becomes costly and impractical, the COs 

shall deposit their collections at least once a week, or as soon as 

the collections reach ₱10,000.00. They shall record all deposits 

made in the CRR.” 

 

2.6. Review of the SL of the Cash-Collecting Officer account showed an 
outstanding/undeposited balance of ₱298,849.14 as accountability of                   

Ms. Cristina P. Balili, former Regular Collecting Officer.

2.8. From the total of ₱298,849.14, an amount of ₱27,403.00 pertains to the 
collections of refunded cash advances and overpayment of expenses from the 

Regular Agency Fund which should have been immediately remitted to the 

National Treasury.  

 

2.9. While the ₱271,446.14 pertains to the collections of tuition fees, business 
income, receipt of funds, and others under the Internally Generated Fund that 

should have been deposited in the Management’s STF or TF accounts. 

 

2.10. Inquiry with the AU disclosed that the unsettled amount could not be 
specifically identified whether undeposited/unremitted collection or only 

resulted from non-entry/erroneous entries made by previous Accounting 

personnel. 

 

2.11. Nonetheless, upon the cessation of the AO’s designation as CO in CY 2011, 
the Management should have enforced Sections 7 and 8, Chapter 2 of the 

Revised Cash Examination Manual (Updated 2013) and required the AO to 

reconcile her records with the books of the AU and should have caused the 

immediate deposit of all monies in her accountability. 

 

2.12. However, due to the Management’s lack of compliance with the above-cited 
provisions, the accountability of the former CO remained unsettled and has 

continued to be reflected in the FSs for nine years. 

 

2.13. Noteworthy to mention are the following sections under PD No. 1445, which 
define the responsibility of the head of agency and the liability of 

accountable officers, as follows:  

 

“Section 102. Primary and secondary responsibility. (1) The head of 

any agency of the government is immediately and primarily 

responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his 

agency. (2) Persons entrusted with the possession or custody of the 

funds or property under the agency head shall be immediately 

responsible to him without prejudice to the liability of either party to 

the government. 

 

Section 105. Measure of liability of accountable officers. (1) Every 

officer accountable for government property shall be liable for its 



68 

 

money value in case of improper or unauthorized use or 

misapplication thereof, by himself or any person for whose acts he 

may be responsible. He shall likewise be liable for all losses, damages, 

or deterioration occasioned by negligence in the keeping or use of the 

property, whether or not it be at the time in his actual custody. (2) 

Every officer accountable for government funds shall be liable for all 

losses resulting from the unlawful deposit, use, or application thereof 

and for all losses attributable to negligence in the keeping of the funds. 

 

Section 122. Submission of reports. Whenever deemed necessary in the 

exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations 

issued by it require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget 

officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, administrative or personnel 

officers, and other responsible officials of the various agencies to 

submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of 

personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise 

of its functions. (2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to 

submit the documents and reports mentioned herein shall 

automatically cause the suspension of payment of their salaries until  

they shall have complied with the requirements of the Commission. (3) 

No appropriation authorized in the General Appropriations Act shall 

be available to pay the salary or any official or employee who violates 

the provisions of this section, without prejudice to any disciplinary 

action that may be instituted against such official or employee.” 

 

2.14. The non-reconciliation of the outstanding balance of the Cash-Collecting 
Officers account for nine years raised doubts on the reliability, accuracy, and 

fair presentation of the FSs. 

 

2.15. We recommended that PNU-Manila Management: 
 

a. reconcile the accountability of the former AO with the Accounting 
Unit’ records and report to the Audit Team the reconciled 

balances to preclude the suspension of salary pursuant to Section 

122 of PD No. 1445; 

 

b. immediately deposit/remit the ₱298,849.14 or the undeposited 
collection as reconciled, if any, to the PNU Cashier/National 

Treasury to preclude the issuance by the COA Audit Team of a 

Notice of Charge; and 

 

c. provide written justification for the non-remittance/non-
reconciliation of collections that resulted in a nine-year long 

outstanding accountability of the AO in the books of PNU-Manila.  

 



69 

 

2.16. The AU of PNU-Manila is currently collating the necessary documents and 
already informed the concerned personnel for the analysis of the account and 

its reconciliation. Adjustments will be immediately prepared thereafter. The 

reconciliation was already attempted in the past, however, despite exhausting 

all efforts, the cash registry could not be located. 

 

 

b. Unsupported/undocumented PNU-Manila’s Investments 
 

2.b. Investments recorded in PNU-Manila Campus totaling ₱1,137,360.00 
includes Financial Assets Designated at Fair Value through Surplus or 

Deficit amounting to ₱920,010.00 and Other Investments amounting to 

₱217,350.00 were not properly documented casting doubt on its 

existence, rights, and valuation.  

 

2.17. Section 15, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that “The 
FSs shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and 

cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation 

of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with 

the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and 

expenses set out in IPSAS. The application of IPSAS, with appropriate 

disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.”  

(Underscoring supplied) 

 

2.18. Chapter 2 of PD No. 1445 provides the Audit Objectives of this Commission 
and stated in Section 58, that for the audit of assets: 

 

“The examination and audit of assets shall be performed with a view 

to ascertaining their existence, ownership, valuation and 

encumbrances as well as the propriety of items composing the 

respective asset accounts, determining their agreement with records; 

proving the accuracy of such records; ascertaining if the assets were 

utilized economically, efficiently and effectively; and evaluating the 

adequacy of controls over the accounts.” 

 

2.19. Review of the PNU-Manila’s SLs of Investments disclosed the following 
items booked in the Financial Assets Designated at Fair Value Through 

Surplus or Deficit (Financial Assets) and Other Investments accounts:

2.20. The Audit Team sent a letter dated January 26, 2021 to the Management 
requesting for the Certified True Copies of documents evidencing ownership, 

authenticity and nature of the investments recorded in the books, however, 

this Office has not yet received the Management’s response. 

 

2.21. Inquiry with the Accounting Unit disclosed that the above investments were 
initially Guarantee Deposits to MERALCO in the previous years for the 

installation of electric facilities of PNU-Manila which were converted to 

preferred stocks, however, they currently do not have the stock certificates on 

hand and other evidence to document the ownership of those investments. 

The Accounting Unit made a representation letter to MERALCO to request 

for the aforesaid documentations. 

 

2.22. Due to the absence of any proof of ownership, the Audit Team could not 
ascertain the existence, rights and accuracy of those investments, posing 

doubts on the Management’s fair presentation of its FSs. 

 

2.23. We recommended that Management of PNU-Manila provide this Office 
with the Certified True Copies of documents evidencing ownership, 

authenticity, nature of the investments and other relevant data to 

support the investments recorded in its books for further evaluation and 

audit actions. 

 

2.24. Management commented that they have already reached out to MERALCO 
via email on February 18, 2021 and sent a formal request via courier service 

(LBC) on February 27, 2021 for the requested documents. It will be 

submitted to the Audit Team once received from MERALCO. 

 

 

c. Unreliable Receivables account balance - ₱450,891,576.34 
 

2.c. The Receivables account totaling ₱458,131,806.27 of PNU-Manila 
campus is unreliable, consisting of overdue receivables of 

₱450,891,576.34, and has the following deficiencies: a) non-provision of 

Allowance for Impairment  for Accounts Receivable  aged two years and 

above without details of  ₱5,204,681.53; b) unsupported receivables aged 

one  to less than 10 years of  ₱1,045,301.26; c) Loans Receivables – 

Others, Due from NGAs and Other Receivables accounts balances which 

remained in the books of accounts for 10 years or more  totaling  

₱9,048,191.52; d) unaccounted balances of ₱6,795,204.71 due to the 



71 

 

migration of accounts to the new e-NGAS; and e) misclassification of 

Receivables accounts pertaining to claims from employees  amounting to  

₱1,027,893.02. 

 

2.25. As at yearend, the Accounts Receivable, Loans Receivable - Others,          
Due from NGAs, and Other Receivables of PNU-Manila have a total balance 

of ₱458,131,806.27, shown as follows:

Non-provision of Allowance for Impairment for Accounts Receivables aged two 

years and above without details- ₱5,204,681.53 

 

2.26. Section 10 of Chapter 7 of the same manual, Volume I on Financial 
Instruments specified that, “An entity shall assess at the end of each 

reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that a financial 

asset or group of financial assets is impaired.  If any such evidence exists, the 

entity shall measure the amount of loss as the difference between the 

carrying amount of the asset and the present value of estimated future cash 

flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.  The 

carrying amount of the asset shall be reduced either directly or through use 

of an allowance account.  The amount of the loss shall be recognized in 

surplus or deficit. In case of Accounts Receivable, the Allowance for 

Impairment shall be provided in an amount based on collectability of 

receivable balances and evaluation of such factors as aging of accounts, 

collection experiences of the agency, expected loss experiences and identified 

doubtful accounts.”  

 

2.27. The PNU-Manila’s Accounts Receivable (AR) balance as at yearend in the 
amount of ₱5,204,681.53 included outstanding balances of ₱4,429,553.26 

aged two years and above which comprises 84.45 percent of the total AR. 

However, details of the actual age of AR cannot be determined due to 

unavailability of historical data to support their existence. The balances 

stemmed from previous years which were only carried-over when the 

University converted from manual system to Electronic New Government 

Accounting System (e-NGAS). 



72 

 

 

2.28. These receivables pertained to unpaid tuition fees from students or 
scholarship providers that were not settled due to lack of enforcement of 

collection. The probability of collecting the outstanding AR balances of 

₱4,429,553.26 was remote since these accounts have been outstanding for 

too long. It has been noticed that Allowance for Impairment was not 

provided, which is not in line with Section 10, Chapter 7 of the GAM for 

NGAs, Volume I which states that “In case of Accounts Receivable, the 

Allowance for Impairment shall be provided in an amount based on 

collectability of receivable balances and evaluation of such factors as aging 

of accounts, collection experiences of the agency, expected loss experiences 

and identified doubtful accounts.” 

 

Unsupported receivables aged one to less than 10 years - ₱1,045,301.26 

 

2.29. Section 63, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides the 
following accounting policies for the Inter-Agency transfer of funds: 

 

“a. Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) shall be entered into by the SA 

and the IA for the undertaking by the latter of the project of the 

former. The MOA shall provide for the requirements for project 

implementation and reporting; 

 

b, Depending on the MOA, the fund transfers may be treated as: a) If 

the MOA provides a condition that the fund shall be spent as 

specified and any excess shall be returned to the SA, the IA shall 

recognize the receipt of the fund as asset at its fair value with a 

corresponding liability, while the SA shall recognize a receivable 

corresponding to the fund transfer; or b) If the MOA provides 

stipulations or no condition, the IA shall recognize the receipt of 

the fund as asset at its fair value with a corresponding revenue, 

while the SA shall recognize an expense corresponding to the    

fund transfer; 

 

f.   Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed 

period for the Project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks 

Issued and the Report of Cash Disbursements to report the 

utilization of the funds. Only actual project expenses shall be 

reported. The reports shall be approved by the Head of the IA; and 

 

g. The IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion 

of the project, if stipulated in the MOA.” 

 

2.30. Meanwhile, PD No. 1445 provides for the following provisions: 
 

“Section 111. Keeping of Accounts. 
 



73 

 

(1) The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is 

necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time 

be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or 

control agencies of the government. 

 

Section 112. Recording of financial transactions. Each government agency 

shall record its financial transactions and operations conformably with 

generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with 

pertinent laws and regulations.” 

 

2.31. Analysis of the Due from NGAs and Other Receivables accounts of PNU-
Manila totaling ₱452,927,124.74 revealed that the outstanding receivables 

aged one to less than 10 years in the total amount of ₱437,083,728.51 

consists of ₱436,038,427.25, which are claims supported by documents 

which remained intact and ₱1,045,301.26, which are claims whose 

supporting documents could not be located anymore.

2.32. COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2005 provides the 
Guidelines and Procedures on the Write-off of Dormant Receivable 

Accounts, Unliquidated Cash Advances and Fund transfers of National 

Government Agencies (NGAs) which define the following dormant accounts: 

 

“5.4 Dormant Receivable Accounts – account which balances 

remained inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for ten (10) 

years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be 

ascertained. 

 

5.6 Dormant Unliquidated Fund Transfers – advances granted by the 

source entity to implementing entity for the implementation of 

programs/projects which remained non-moving for ten (10) years or 

more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be 

ascertained.” 

 



74 

 

2.33. Sections 8.2 and 8.3 of the same Circular, provide that the Head of the 
government agency shall file the request for authority to write-off dormant 

receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers to the 

COA Audit Team Leader (ATL) and/or Supervising Auditor (SA) supported 

by certified relevant documents validating the existence of the conditions. 
 

2.34. Audit of the Loans Receivable-Others, Due from NGAs and Other 
Receivables accounts of PNU-Manila totaling ₱452,927,124.74 revealed that 

balances of ₱9,048,191.52 are already dormant receivables as these represent 

claims that are non-moving in the books of accounts for 10 years or more and 

their settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained. The continued 

existence of these long outstanding non-moving receivables in the books of 

accounts overstated the Receivable accounts balances, the summary follows:

III-Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) of the GAM for NGAs and 

defines that the Due from Officers and Employees “account is debited to 

recognize amount of claims from agency's officers and employees for 

overpayment (not covered by Notice of Disallowance), cash shortage, loss of 

assets and other bills issued by the agency, losses in excess of allowable 

variance between books and volumetric count of merchandise inventory and 

the like (not covered by Notice of Charge). This account is credited for 

receipt of payment, write- off and approved relief from property 

accountability.”

Overtime claims excluding 

services rendered while on 

travel  

787.61 

Total ₱1,027,893.02 

 

2.38. The above misclassification overstated the AR account by ₱11,520.00 and 
the Other Receivable accounts by ₱1,016,373.02 while understating the Due 

from Officer and Employees account by ₱1,027,893.02. 

 

2.39. We recommended that PNU-Manila: 
 

a. formulate/establish guidelines in the provision of allowance for 
doubtful accounts that are based on factors such as aging of 

accounts and collectability pursuant to Section 10, Chapter 7 of 

the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; 

 

b. enforce collections of Accounts Receivables, thru sending of 
Demand Letters to the debtors, especially those duly supported 

with valid documents; 

 

c. monitor the utilization and liquidation of fund transfers and 
compliance by the concerned NGAs with the reporting 

requirements and send Demand Letters to defaulting recipients 

requiring the immediate settlement of all unliquidated fund 

transfers and the return of any excess; 

 

d. demand settlement of overdue accounts and after exhausting all 
means, request an authority for write-off of the dormant accounts 

from COA following the guidelines prescribed under COA 

Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 in order to clear 

the books of long outstanding inactive balances; 

 

e. look for the details of the unreconciled balances of ₱6,795,204.71 
and prepare the necessary adjustment; 



77 

 

f. intensify efforts to locate and communicate with the former 
personnel with outstanding balances and take appropriate 

action(s) to collect the said receivables; 

 

g. reclassify from AR and Other Receivables accounts with balances 
of ₱11,520.00 and ₱1,016,373.02, respectively, to Due from 

Officers and Employees account to properly record the claims 

from active employees; 

 

h. take actions to settle the₱1,027,893.02 collectible from active PNU 
employees; and 

 

i. require officials and employees to secure clearance from money 
and property accountability from heads of concerned Offices 

before resignation/separation or retirement to ensure that all 

outstanding cash advances are settled. Moreover, hold liable all 

signatories of said clearance in the event accountable 

officials/employees are allowed to resign or retire without settling 

their dues and unliquidated cash advances. 

  

2.40. The PNU-Manila Management commented that the Guidelines for the 
provision of allowance for doubtful accounts have been forwarded to the 

Office of the Vice President for Finance and Administration (OVPFA) for 

review and endorsement. Furthermore, the analysis of the account is in 

process, Demand Letters will be issued and request for write-off will be 

prepared after thorough review and analysis of the account. While the 

amount of ₱1,027,893.02 is adjusted under JEV No. 2021-03-00037 and the 

AU will review and will take the necessary actions regarding the collection 

thereof.  Lastly, securing clearances prior to resignation/separation or 

retirement is the actual practice of the University and is being strictly 

implemented. 

 

 

d. Unreconciled Intra-Agency Accounts of PNU-Mindanao 
 

2.d. The discrepancy in the PNU-Mindanao campus’ reciprocal accounts, 
Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds with balances totaling 

₱826,462.76 and ₱1,538,819.16, respectively, was not reconciled, thus 

affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the FSs. 

 

2.41. Verification of the consolidated FSs revealed the existing balances as at 
yearend of Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds totaling 

₱826,462.76 and ₱1,538,819.16, respectively, as shown in Table 23:

Due to Other Funds 273,914.41 1,264,904.75 1,538,819.16 

 

2.42. The Accountant disclosed that the accounts were not reconciled at yearend 
due to the presence of prior years’ unaccounted errors wherein no details are 

available in the e-NGAs, thus necessitating further review.  The Accountant 

admitted the lapses and assured to look into the details of the accounts. 

 

2.43. We recommended that PNU-Mindanao, thru the Accountant, reconcile 
the accounts and investigate the reasons for the incurrence of errors 

which resulted in the reciprocal account’s balances between funds at 

yearend and prepare the necessary adjustments.  Further, initiate 

immediate settlement of liabilities, if any, after the reconciliation. 
 

2.44. The Management commented that the balances of the reciprocal accounts are 
prior and current years’ balances.  The Accountant is in the process of 

reconciling works.  Further, the investigation of balances is being made by 

tracing the documents sourced from the prior years. 

 

 

e. Doubtful Validity of Advances to Contractors 
 

2.e. The absence of details on the CY 2016 balance of ₱557,350.66 in the 
Advances to Contractors account, from the migration of accounts on the 

adoption and implementation of the e-NGAS, raised doubts on the 

validity and accuracy of its year-end balance of ₱951,994.19. The failure 

of Management to recoup the Advances to Contractors contradicts 

certain provisions in Annex E of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules 

and Regulations of RA No. 9184. 

 

2.45. Annex E of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) 
of RA No. 9184 provides, among others, the following: 

 

“4.1 The procuring entity shall, upon a written request of the 

contractor which shall be submitted as a contract document, 

make an advance payment to the contractor in an amount not 

exceeding fifteen percent (15%) of the total contract price, to be 

made in lump sum or, at the most, two instalments according to a 

schedule specified in the Instructions to Bidders and other 

relevant Tender Documents. 

 

4.3   The advance payment shall be repaid by the contractor by 

deducting fifteen percent (15%) from his periodic progress 



79 

 

payments a percentage equal to the percentage of the total 

contract price used for the advance payment. 

 

5.3   The procuring entity shall deduct the following from the certified 

gross amounts to be paid to the contractor as progress payment: 

 

a) Cumulative value of the work previously certified and paid for. 

b) Portion of the advance payment to be recouped. 

c) Retention money in accordance with the condition of contract. 

d) Amount to cover third party liabilities. 

e) Amount to cover uncorrected discovered defects in the works.” 

 

2.46. The above-cited provisions clearly state that a procuring entity is allowed to 
make an advance payment to the contractor not exceeding 15 percent of the 

total contract price to facilitate the mobilization of a project. However, this 

advance payment shall be recouped or recovered back from the contractor 

“by deducting fifteen percent (15%) from his periodic progress payments” 

until the same is fully exhausted. 

 

2.47. Audit of the year-end balance of the Advances to Contractors account 
revealed that a total of ₱557,350.66 remained unrecouped and dormant since 

CY 2016, details are as follows:  

 
Table 24: Aging of Advances to Contractors Account as of December 31, 2020 

Contractor 2016 2017 2018 2019 Remarks 

Balance from previous years ₱  557,350.66 ₱            - ₱            - ₱                  -   

Marie-Kris Construction and 

Trading

Grandstar General Contractor    169,766.59 With ongoing 

project 

Total ₱  557,350.66 - - ₱  394,643.54  

 

2.48. The amount reflected in the preceding table pertaining to CY 2016 stemmed 
from unrecouped amount balances, the composition of which was not 

identified in the books due to the absence of readily available records in 

previous years when the beginning balance was setup during the University’s 

adoption and implementation of the e-NGAs. 

 

2.49. The non-reconciliation and the non-availability of data to support the 
outstanding balances raised doubts as to the validity and propriety of the 

reported year-end balances of the account Advances to Contractors. 

Meanwhile, the non-recovery of the advances deprived the University of 

funds that can be used for operations of other projects that could bring 

economic benefit to stakeholders.  
 

 

 



80 

 

2.50. We recommended that PNU-Manila Management: 
 

a. review and analyze the Advances to Contractors account’s 
outstanding balance to determine its validity and propriety and to 

reflect in the books the correct and accurate balance as at 

yearend; 

 

b. reconcile and submit details relative to the outstanding 
unrecovered advances, reflecting the: nature of the project; 

contractor; date of payment of the 15 percent mobilization fee; 

and the check number covering the related payments, among 

others; 

 

c. determine and hold liable the officers/employees responsible for 
the non-recoupment; and 

 

d. for confirmed unrecouped Advances to Contractors, initiate its 
immediate refund or deduct the unrecouped amount for any 

claims due to the contractors. 

 

2.51. The Management commented that the balance of ₱557,350.66 pertains to 
reconciling items since CY 2005 which were forwarded to the e-NGAS 

during the migration of data from the manual system. The AU is unable to 

reconcile the said accounts since the transactions were made in the early 70s 

and 80s, records are no longer available, and the concerned 

officers/employees have already retired, hence the probability of reconciling 

the account is very slim. Thus, the University would like to inquire on the 

possibility of writing-off the said reconciling items. Lastly, confirmation of 

the unrecouped Advances to Contractors will be treated prospectively. 

 

 

f. Unreconciled discrepancy between the PPE book balance and the RPCPPE - 
₱42,997,149.12 and non-submission of RPCPPE by two Campuses 

 

2.f. The accuracy, existence and valuation of the reported PPE accounts in 
the total amount of ₱638,475,342.81 cannot be ascertained due to the 

discrepancy of ₱42,997,149.12 between the books and the RPCPPE of 

PNU-Manila and PNU-South Luzon and the non-submission of the 

RPCPPE of PNU-Visayas and PNU-Mindanao to substantiate the PPE 

book balances totaling ₱125,550,751.85. 

 

2.52. Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, on the Physical 
Count of PPE, states that: 

 

“The entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE, which shall 

be done annually and presented on the Report on the Physical Count 



81 

 

of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 71) as at 

December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor 

concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment 

found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall 

be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper 

accounting/recording.” (Underscoring supplied) 

 

2.53. While Section 42, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that 
“xxxxx. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall 

likewise maintain Property Cards (PC) for PPE in their custody to account 

for the receipt and disposition of the same.  The balance per PC shall be 

reconciled with Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) 

maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit.  They shall also be reconciled 

with other property records like Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR).” 

 

2.54. Also, COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 prescribes the 
guidelines and procedures on inventory-taking, recognition of those found at 

station and disposition for non-existing/missing PPE items for the one-time 

cleansing of PPE accounts to establish PPE balances that are verifiable as to 

existence, condition and accountability. 

 

2.55. Comparison between the PPE accounts records of the AU and the RPCPPE 
prepared by the Property Unit of PNU-Manila and PNU-South Luzon 

showed a discrepancy of ₱10,928,124.99 and ₱32,069,024.13, respectively. 

Details are as follows:

2.56. The Audit Team noted that the unreconciled balances between the 
Accounting and Property records is a perennial issue of both Campuses. 

 

2.57. PNU-Manila stated that both the Accounting and Property Units are 
constantly working together in identifying and adjusting the reconciling 

items but due to the volume of data involved in the reconciliation process, 

they only managed to reconcile some of the accounts within the year. 

Whereas the PNU-South Luzon’s non-reconciliation of records reflects the 

non-coordination between the concerned offices which cast doubts on the 

accuracy and reliability of the PPE account balances. 

 

2.58. Meanwhile, the PPE booked in PNU-Visayas and PNU-Mindanao amounting 
to ₱64,820,242.41and ₱60,730,509.44, respectively, could not be ascertained 

due to the non-submission of the RPCPPE, to validate: (1) whether the items 

recorded as PPE still exist; (2) the condition thereof; and (3) whether all 

items of PPE are recorded in the books.  

 

2.59. Other errors and deficiencies were also disclosed in the audit of PPE 
accounts which further cast doubt on the correctness and validity of the 

reported balances in the FSs: 

 

Campus Audit Observations 

PNU-Mindanao  The physical count of PPE was only conducted five days 
prior to the prescribed transmittal of the report to the Audit 

Team, as the Supply Officer prioritized other reports causing 

the Agency’s non-compliance with its preparation and 

submission; 

 There was no officially created Inventory Committee tasked 
to undertake the conduct of the physical inventory-taking up 

to the report preparation; 

 The faculty members were not informed of the scheduled 



83 

 

Campus Audit Observations 

physical inventory-taking. It is emphasized that all PPE 

items, including those issued to the faculty members, need to 

be subjected to the count, wherever/whatever the status of the 

PPE item maybe; 

 There were PPE items that have no property tag for easy 
identification; 

 No property stickers were prepared to be used in tagging the 
counted PPE items; and 

 Only the serviceable PPE items were included in the count, 
other PPEs such as those that are unserviceable, obsolete, etc. 

were excluded from the count. 

PNU-Visayas 

 

Despite the conduct of physical count, the Inventory Committee 

was not able to complete the RPCPPE. Moreover, there are no 

Property Cards being maintained for some of its buildings and 

other structures.  Both the Campus’ Accountant and the Supply 

and/or Property Officer also admitted that they were not able to 

reconcile their records.  

PNU-Manila The Accounting records of PNU-Manila include an 

Accumulated Depreciation–Machinery amounting to ₱1,482.40. 

However, no amount was reported for Machinery account. 

 

2.60. The foregoing lapses in property management cast doubts on the correctness 
and existence of the PPE recorded balances in the Agency’s books of 

accounts, thereby affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the FSs. 
 

2.61. We recommended that Management: 
 

PNU-Manila 

a. thru the Accounting Unit, the Property Unit and Inventory 
Committee, conduct analysis of PPE accounts vis-à-vis the 

RPCPPE and other property records to identify and clear the 

reconciling items; 

b. prepare the necessary journal entries to adjust the duly identified 
details of the reconciling items, in order to reflect the correct 

account balances;  

 

c. perform periodic reconciliation of property records between the 
Accounting Unit and Property Unit to timely identify any 

discrepancy for adjustment of both records;  

 

PNU-South Luzon 

d. thru its Accounting staff and the Supply and Property Officer, 
exhaust all means to account for the huge difference noted between 

the RPCPPE and the Accounting records to arrive at reliable 

balances of PPE accounts; 



84 

 

PNU-Mindanao 

e. thru its Inventory Committee, prioritize the conduct of physical 
count of Inventory and PPE and prepare the RPCPPE, to comply 

with its submission as prescribed;  

 

f. properly plan/organize the conduct of physical inventory-taking to 
ascertain the existence, completeness and condition of all PPEs 

owned by PNU-Mindanao and comply with the guidelines and 

procedures prescribed in COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated 

January 31, 2020; 

 

PNU-Visayas 

g. thru its Accountant and the Supply and/or Property Officer, exert 
efforts for the immediate reconciliation of their respective records 

in order to present fairly the financial position of the Agency and 

comply as soon as possible with the one-time cleansing of PPE 

account balances provided for under COA Circular No. 2020-006 

dated January 31, 2020; 

 

h. thru its Supply and/or Property Officer, prepare and maintain 
Property Card (PC) for all the PPE accounts and consistently 

update the same; and 

 

i. thru the Inventory Committee, timely accomplish the RPCPPE as 
at yearend and submit the original copy of the report to the 

Auditor concerned, thru the Accounting Unit, not later than 

January 31 of the following year. 

 

2.62. The Management’s comments and the Audit Team’s rejoinder are as follows: 
 

Management’s Comment Auditor’s Rejoinder 

PNU-Manila  

The Management has already instructed Finance 

and Property Division to reconcile and review the 

PPE accounts. Upon review, adjustments will be 

made to the reconciled accounts. 

 

PNU South Luzon  

The Management promised to prioritize the 

reconciliation of the inventory of PPEs between the 

Accounting and the Property Supply Unit.  The 

Director and Provost has allegedly given directives 

to the Accounting and Supply and Property Office 

to maintain efficient records of all the University’s 

properties and equipment. 

Management comments 

are duly noted.  Proper 

monitoring will be 

undertaken by the Audit 

Team to ensure that the 

Agency complies with our 

audit recommendation. 

 

 

 



85 

 

Management’s Comment Auditor’s Rejoinder 

PNU-Mindanao  

For this year, the Institution will see to it that the 

conduct of the physical count of PPE will be given 

priority. The Management already included the 

physical count of inventories in the institutional 

priorities to guarantee an on-time submission of 

reports.  In fact, there are already initiatives made. 

 

A special meeting was called by the Management to 

analyze the gaps and root cause of the situation.  In 

this light, an Inventory Plan was crafted to include 

the necessary procedures of inventory-taking. 

 

PNU-Visayas  

The Management noted the Commission on Audit’s 

observation. It already sent a memorandum to the 

responsible person for compliance. 

 

 

 

g. Unreconciled and negative balances in Payable accounts of PNU-Manila and 
Mindanao– ₱2,790,612.57 

 

2.g. The Payable accounts of PNU-Manila and PNU-Mindanao contain 
unreconciled and negative balances totaling ₱1,695,123.45 and 

₱1,095,489.12, respectively, contrary to COA Circular No. 2020-001 

dated January 8, 2020, thus the accuracy, valuation and obligations, and 

the fair presentation of the FSs cannot be relied upon. 

 

2.63. COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 provides the Revised 
Chart of Accounts (Updated 2015), which cites the accounts shown below: 

 

"Account Title

86 

 

2.64. Verification of the Accounts Payable of PNU-Manila under the Internally 
Generated Income (IGI) Fund Cluster revealed the presence of three SLs 

under the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) account, as follows:

Total ₱ 1,695,123.45 

 

2.65. The LBP Balance 12-31-2015 and LBP Payroll existed due to the 
Management’s previous practice of transferring funds for payroll purposes to 

LBP and recording it under the AP account which was discussed in CAAR 

CY 2018 re: misclassification of payables for salaries, wages and allowances. 

The said practice was discontinued in November 2019 due to the creation of 

a Payroll account, however, the two SLs with balances of ₱153,615.61 and 

₱806,757.52, respectively, have remained unreconciled. These should have 

already been closed in adherence to the proper entries for payroll purposes. 

 

2.66. Further, the above-cited COA Circular states that the Due to BIR account is 
used to recognize withholding of taxes from officers/employees and other 

entities and is debited for remittance of the taxes withheld to the BIR, thus 

the Accounting Unit does not need to forward the amount to be paid from the 

Due to BIR account to the AP account, as the payment of taxes would only 

require debiting the Due to BIR account and crediting the Cash-in-Bank, 

Local Currency, Current Account. 

 

2.67. Moreover, the Accounts Payable and the Due to Officers and Employees 
accounts of PNU-Mindanao totaling ₱1,620,943.66, with age of more than 

two years, are the Campus’ payables to its resigned, retired and transferred 

employees. Also, included in the said accounts are the negative balances of 

accounts totaling ₱35,419.17, as summarized below:

2.68. The Accountant of PNU-Mindanao states that those recorded payables are 
still subject to reconciliation.  She further informed that there were also 

existing payables to faculty for their prior year’s Proportional Vacation Pay 

(PVP) due to non-submission of faculty clearance, which is a pre-requisite in 

claiming their PVP.  The Dean for Academic Affairs already facilitated the 

clearance of the faculty concerned but still the latter did not take action.  The 

Management informed that they will send a final demand to the concerned 

faculty for immediate action.  Moreover, the Accountant will look into the 

individual records of the employees and reconcile their payable accounts. 

 

2.69. The presence of the outstanding payables for two years or more despite the 
information given to the Accountant to revert the same and the existing 

negative balances, rendered the accuracy and reliability of the Accounts 

Payable and Due to Officers and Employees account balances doubtful. 

 

2.70.  We recommended that Management: 
 

PNU-Manila 

a. reconcile and close the three SLs maintained for Accounts Payable 
account pertaining to the LBP; 

 

b. refrain from using the Accounts Payable account for 
remittances/payment of taxes and observe the use of appropriate 

accounts as prescribed in the Revised Chart of Accounts of the 

GAM for NGAs, Volume III; 

 

c. provide the Audit Team with the signed JEVs and supporting 
documents to support reconciliation/closure of SLs; and 

 

PNU-Mindanao 

d. thru the Accountant, reconcile the individual records of payables 
to officers and employees and correct the existing negative 

balances to fairly present the account in the FSs. 

 

2.71. The Management’s comments are as follows:

Management’s Comments 

No. 2021-03-000353 dated March 29, 2021 and the three SLs for LBP no 

longer have an outstanding balance. 

PNU-Mindanao 

The Management conveyed that the balances of Accounts Payable are still 

subject to reconciliation.  Balances of resigned, retired and transferred 

employees are still subject to verification as this might be due to erroneous 

entries made. As to the unclaimed PVP of faculty, the Management will take 

action on this matter. 

 

 

h. Unremitted/Undocumented/Negative/Unreconciled balances in the Inter-agency 
Payables 

 

2.h. The Due to GSIS, Due to Pag-IBIG and Due to PhilHealth accounts of 
PNU-Manila totaling ₱3,095,566.34 included: (a) carry-over prior years’ 

balances not supported with details of ₱2,516,748.62, out of the 

unremitted amount of ₱2,616,344.54; (b) abnormal/negative balances 

amounting to ₱452,889.15; and (c) reconciling balances of ₱932,110.95. 

While, the Due to BIR account balance of ₱2,147,213.04 in PNU-South 

Luzon refers to prior years’ unremitted amount due to absence of 

documents. The foregoing affected the Management’s assertions of 

accuracy and fair presentation of the Inter-agency Payables account in 

the FSs.  

 

2.72. COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 prescribes the Revised 
Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) of the GAM for NGAs, Volume III which 

states that the Due to GSIS, Due to PhilHealth and Due to Pag-IBIG accounts 

shall have a normal credit balance. 

 

2.73. Detailed review of the SLs of PNU-Manila’s Inter-Agency payables 
disclosed the following deficiencies, summarized in the succeeding table:

Unremitted balances 

 

2.74. The PNU-Manila campus already remitted the contributions, premiums and 
loan amortization payments of employees together with the government 

share in premiums to GSIS, Pag-IBIG, and PhilHealth for the month of 

December 2020, which were already taken up in the books. However, an 

amount of ₱2,616,344.54 was still unremitted as at yearend, of which 

₱99,595.92 pertained to CY 2020 transaction. 

 

2.75. Meanwhile, review and verification of Due to BIR account of PNU-South 
Luzon disclosed a balance of ₱2,147,213.04, representing unremitted taxes of 

prior years’ CY 2014 and below. Details are as follows: 

 

Campus Findings and Observations 

PNU-Manila The unremitted amount of ₱2,516,748.62 came from prior years’ 

(PYs) transactions withheld from the employees for their Personal 

Share, Loan Payments, and Investments that remained outstanding 

in the books. This Office could not determine the age of these 

unremitted PY balances as these are only carry-over balances not 

supported with details upon migration of accounts from CY 2016 

old electronic New Government Accounting System (eNGAs) to 

the new e-NGAs. Hence, it can be deduced that there are PY 

balances which are outstanding earlier than CY 2016. 

PNU-South 

Luzon 

Inquiry with the PNU-South Luzon’s Accounting Staff revealed 

that in PYs, withheld taxes were remitted to the BIR by the PNU-

Main.  They were informed recently that remittance of said 

withheld taxes will be made by the PNU-South Luzon Campus 

since it already has its own Tax Identification Number (TIN). 

However, the said withheld taxes were not remitted immediately 

due to lacking documents required for proper remittance to BIR.   

 

Current year’s taxes are already remitted regularly to the BIR.  

However, due to lack of documents to support the required alpha 

listing of taxpayers pertaining to the previous year’s balance of 

₱2,147,213.04, the same remained unremitted to date.  

 

2.76. Also noted in the accounts of PNU-Manila is the aggregate negative balance 
of ₱452,889.15 from PYs and Current Year’s abnormal balances of 

₱407,766.36 and ₱45,122.79, respectively, brought about by erroneous 



90 

 

entries and over-remittances of withheld Personal/Employee Share and 

Employees’ Loan Payments, summarized as follows:

2.77. Moreover, SLs on “Reconciling Items” for each Inter-Agency Payable 
accounts are being maintained due to inadequacy of supporting documents as 

a result of the migration of accounts from the old version of the e-NGAS to 

its updated version in CY 2016.  To date, an amount of ₱932,110.95 

remained unreconciled in PNU-Manila, thus remained unsettled, casting 

doubts on the validity and accuracy of the accounts.  

 

2.78. The non-remittance of the withheld contributions/deductions may result in 
imposition of penalties and suspension of privileges and benefits provided by 

the abovementioned agencies. Further, the presence of unreconciled, 

undocumented and negative balances leads to doubtful accuracy and fair 

presentation of the accounts Due to GSIS, Due to Pag-IBIG, Due to 

PhilHealth and Due to BIR in its FSs as at yearend. 

 

2.79. We recommended that Management:  
 

PNU-Manila 

a. remit immediately the CY 2020 unremitted balances of 
₱99,595.92; 

 

b. verify and analyze the prior years’ unremitted balances of 
₱2,516,748.62 and effect adjustments, if necessary, otherwise remit 

the balance immediately to avoid penalty and surcharges and 

impose sanctions on employees responsible for non-remittance 

thereof;  

 

c. analyze the negative balance of ₱452,889.15 and the Reconciling 
Items of ₱932,110.95 to determine the errors and discrepancy for 

appropriate adjustment; 

 

PNU-South Luzon 

d. thru the Accounting Staff, exert effort to retrieve from files the 
required alpha listings of taxpayers to support the remittance of 



91 

 

the prior years’ taxes withheld by the PNU-South Luzon to the 

BIR; and 
 

e. remit immediately to the BIR the unremitted balance of 
₱2,147,213.04 as soon as the required documents are retrieved. 

 

2.80. The Management’s Comments and Auditor’s Rejoinders are as follows: 
 

Management’s Comments Auditor’s Rejoinder 

PNU-Manila 

Management expressed that the AU will 

adhere to the aforementioned 

recommendations and a committee was 

created to review the enormous balances 

reflected in the respective accounts’ SLs 

and the remittance shall be made after the 

conduct of verification of accounts. 

 

PNU-South Luzon 

The Executive Director and Provost has 

allegedly given the directive to the 

Accounting staff to exert efforts to retrieve 

files necessary for the remittance of prior 

years’ taxes withheld and to immediately 

remit the same to the BIR. 

The PNU-South Luzon COA 

Audit Team took note of the 

Management’s comments but 

requires submission of the proof 

of remittance of the subject 

withholding taxes to the BIR for 

monitoring purposes. 

 

 

i. Unascertained validity of the Due to NGAs account balance 
 

2.i. The validity of the Due to NGAs account with year-end balance of 
₱58,730,022.48 cannot be ascertained due to inclusion of funds (a) for 

inactive research projects which should have been returned by PNU to 

the Source Agencies/grantors amounting to ₱16,417,578.42, of which 

₱4,228,144.32 has no details on the fund source/transferring entities; (b) 

with unknown source/without supporting documents amounting to  

₱2,371,277.31; and (c) with  abnormal/negative balances of 

₱1,138,249.24. 

 

2.81. Section 4.9 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 on the 
Rules and Regulations in the Grant, Utilization and Liquidation of Funds 

Transferred to Implementing Agencies, provides, among others, the Duties 

and Responsibilities of the Implementing Agencies, wherein Section 6.7 

stated “return to the Source Agency (SA) any unused balance and refund of 

disallowance upon completion of the project.” 

 

2.82. Section 10 of the General Provision for the RA No. 11465, the GAA for FY 
2020, mandates the SUCs to “revert all balances of Special, Fiduciary or 



92 

 

Trust Funds to the General Fund in any of the following instances: (i) when 

there is no legal basis; (ii) when their terms have expired; or (ii) when they 

are no longer necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which said 

funds were established.” 

 

2.83. COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 prescribes the Revised 
Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) of the GAM for NGAs, Volume III and 

defines the Due to NGAs and Trust Liabilities account, as follows: 

 

“Account Title

subject to liquidation and other inter-agency 

transactions. This account is debited for delivery of 

goods/services, liquidation of funds received and 

settlement of liabilities, and/or adjustments.” 

 

2.84. The Due to NGAs of PNU-Manila account showed a balance of 
₱58,730,022.48, which is composed of amounts transferred from other 

government agencies for the implementation of projects. Details are as

2.85. Review of the SLs disclosed that the ₱58,730,022.48 balance as at yearend 
revealed the following deficiencies: a) inactive research projects; b) unknown 

sources of funds; and c) abnormal/negative balances, summarized in the table 

below.

2.86. The inactive Research Projects include fund transfers from different Source 
Agencies and other unidentified sources totaling ₱16,417,578.42 for various 

research projects, details are as follows:

2.87. As shown in the table above, the accumulated unused balances of 
₱16,417,578.42 from inactive research projects had remained in the bank 

account of the University for more than five years.  COA Circular No. 94-

013 dated December 13, 1994 provides the Rules and Regulations on the 

grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to Implementing 

Agencies (IAs). Item No. 6.7 thereof emphasizes that the IA shall return to 

the SA any unused balance and refund of disallowance upon completion of 

the project. However, as these projects have become inactive and the 

corresponding balances became dormant for more than five years, these 

became unnecessary STF that should be reverted to the National Treasury as 

prescribed by DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 4-2012 and Section 10 of 

the General Provisions of GAA, RA No. 11465, FY 2020. The continued 

non-remittance of unused funds when it is no longer necessary for the 

attainment of the purposes resulted in unnecessary prolonged recognition of 

liability of the said amount. 

 

2.88. Meanwhile, the propriety of the recorded Due to NGAs account in the 
amount of ₱2,371,277.31 named under Teresita Aquino-Oreta could not be 

determined whether sourced from NGAs or private individuals due to lack of 

documentation on hand, thus it could possibly overstate the Due to NGAs 

account. 

 

2.89. Further, as specified by the GAM for NGAs, Volume III, the Due to NGAs 
account as a Liability account will have a normal credit balance, however, a 

total of ₱1,138,249.24 appeared as a debit balance, details are as follows:

01-Jan-16 Beginning Balances of Accounts 1,108,499.24 

Total ₱1,138,249.24 

 

2.90. The ₱1,108,499.24 occurred upon the migration from the old version to the 
new version of the e-NGAS while the ₱29,750.00 resulted from the transfer 

of SL balances from Other Payables account for the NRCP Project A 105 - 

Prof Z. Reyes. Both items require review, reconciliation and adjusting entries 

from the Accounting Unit. 

 

2.91. We recommended that Management of PNU-Manila, thru the University 
Accountant: 

 

a. revert to the National Treasury the unrefunded, dormant, and 
unnecessary trust fund of ₱16,417,578.42 and provide OR(s) of the 

reversion and JEV to the identified Source Agencies for 



95 

 

information and appropriate action, copy furnished the Audit 

Team;  

 

b. furnish the Audit Team with the MOA undertaken by the 
University with Teresita Aquino-Oreta amounting to 

₱2,450,474.44 for further review; and 

 

c. reconcile the balances of all accounts under Due to NGAs giving 
priority to those with negative balances. 

 

2.92. The Accounting Unit will determine the amount to be reverted and the same 
shall be reported to the PNU-Management for approval while the MOA of 

Teresita Aquino-Oreta will be forwarded to the Audit Team once located. As 

for the reconciliation of balances, analysis of the account is currently ongoing 

and the corresponding adjustments will follow thereafter. 

 

 

j. Deficiencies affecting the reliability of Expense account balance – 
₱16,209,342.00 

 

Misclassification of Mid-Year Bonus of PNU-Manila 

 

2.j. The Mid-Year Bonus (MYB) amounting to ₱16,209,342.00 of PNU-
Manila is recorded under the Other Bonuses and Allowances account 

instead of the appropriate Mid-Year Bonus-Civilian account. Moreover, 

the Universal Account Code Structure (UACS) Object Code used is not 

in consonance with COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020, 

thus affected the classification, accuracy and the fair presentation of the 

FSs as of December 31, 2020. 

 

2.93. COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 prescribes the Revised 
Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) of the GAM for NGAs, Volume III, 

wherein the Mid-Year Bonus account is introduced and defined as “account 

is debited to recognize the amount of mid-year bonus granted annually to 

government officials and employees as authorized by law. This account is 

credited, at yearend, to close to the Revenue and Expense Summary account, 

and/or adjustments.” 

 

2.94. The Accounting Unit of PNU-Manila updated their eNGAS to conform to the 
Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) and in compliance with the 

above-cited Circular. 

 

2.95. It was noted that the SLs of the Other Bonuses and Allowance account 
showed that the Accounting Unit did not make the necessary adjustment to 

reclassify the erroneous entry made in May 2020 for the payment of MYB 



96 

 

which was taken up as Other Bonuses and Allowances amounting to 

₱16,209,342.00, hence it remained in that account as at yearend. 

 

2.96. Furthermore, PNU-Manila Campus’ Financial Accountability Report (FAR) 
No. 1-A or the Summary of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, 

Disbursements and Balances by Object of Expenditure for the Quarter 

Ending December 31, 2020 shows the Mid-Year Bonus account depicted a 

Universal Account Code Structure (UACS) Object Code of 5010299036 

which is different from the prescribed 5010216001 as provided for in the 

Revised Chart of Accounts. 

 

2.97. The non-adjustment by the PNU-Manila’s Accounting Unit resulted in an 
understated Mid-Year Bonus account and an overstated Other Bonuses and 

Allowances account by ₱16,209,342.00, thus affected the Management’s 

assertions of: 1) classification- that all transactions are recorded in the correct 

accounts in the GL; 2) accuracy- that all transactions and events are 

appropriately recorded and without errors; and the 3) fair presentation of     

the FSs. 

 

2.98. We recommended that PNU-Manila Management: 
 

a. prepare the necessary adjustments to properly classify the Mid-
Year Bonus amounting to ₱16,209,342.00; and 

 

b. revise the FAR No. 1-A or the Summary of Appropriations, 
Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and Balances by Object of 

Expenditure for the Quarter Ending December 31, 2020, to 

conform to the revised Universal Account Code Structure (UACS) 

Object Code for the MYB account. 

 

2.99. Management commented that the reclassification of the Mid-Year Bonus 
account amounting to ₱16,209,342.00 for CY 2020 will be treated 

prospectively and will be adjusted in the restated FSs since the books of 

accounts are already closed. Moreover, the Budget Resource and Planning 

Unit submitted to the Audit Team the revised FAR No. 1 to reflect the 

correct UACS of the subjected account. Lastly, the University’s e-NGAS has 

been updated in February 2021 and now carries the new account titles and 

codes, hence the use of the new Chart of Accounts under COA Circular No. 

2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 is now being implemented.

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 

Delayed/Unsubmitted Financial Reports 

 

3. The non-submission or delayed submission by PNU Campuses of the required 
financial reports (DVs, General Journals, LRs, Monthly Trial Balance and 

Quarterly Financial Statements), including their supporting 

documents/schedules and the signed JEVs to the Audit Team within the 

prescribed period is contrary to Section 122 of PD No. 1445; Section 60, 

Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of COA 

Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, and had precluded the Audit 

Team from timely performance of its Constitutionally-mandated auditorial and 

reportorial functions. 

 

3.1. Section 122 of PD No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing 
Code of the Philippines, provides that:  

 

“Paragraph 1 - “Submission of Reports. Whenever deemed necessary in 

the exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations 

issued by it require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget 

officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, administrative or personnel 

officers, and other responsible officials of the various agencies to 

submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of 

personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise 

of its functions.” 

 

Paragraph 2 - “Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit 

the documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause 

the suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have 

complied with the requirements of the Commission.” 

 

Paragraph 3 - “No appropriation authorized in the General 

Appropriations Act shall be available to pay the salary or any official 

or employee who violates the provisions of this section, without 

prejudice to any disciplinary action that may be instituted against such 

official or employee.” 

 

3.2. In addition, Section 60.c, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I 
provides the following deadlines for submission: 

 

“Deadlines on Submission of Reports - All NGAs shall prepare and 

submit the following financial statements and schedules as follows, 

within the prescribed deadline:

3.3. Lastly, Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of the Revised Rules and Regulations on the 
Settlement of Accounts (RRSA), as prescribed under COA Circular                          

No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, provide the following 

responsibilities of the Agency Head and Accountant for audit and settlement 

of accounts: 

 

“Section 7.1 – Responsibility of the Agency Head 

 

7.1.1 The head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all 
government funds and property pertaining to his agency, 

shall ensure that: 

(a) the required financial and other reports and statements 
are submitted by the concerned agency officials in such 

form and within the period prescribed by the 

Commission; 

(b) the settlement of disallowances and charges is made 
within the prescribed period; 

(c) the requirements of transactions suspended in audit are 
complied with; and 

(d) appropriate actions are taken on the deficiencies noted 
as contained in the AOM. 

 

 Section 7.2 – Responsibility of the Agency Accountant 

 

7.2.1 The Chief Accountant, bookkeeper or other authorized 
official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions 

of the audited agency shall ensure that: 

(a) The reports and supporting documents submitted by the 
accountable officers are immediately recorded in the 

books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within 

the first ten (10) days of the ensuing month; 



99 

 

(b) The financial records are made accessible at reasonable 
hours to the Auditor or his authorized representatives 

when needed” 
 

 

a. Disbursement Vouchers and Liquidation Reports  
 

3.4. The Audit Team of PNU-Manila campus could not immediately attest to the 
authenticity and validity of the disbursements and cash transfers/releases 

since the pertinent DVs with its accompanying supporting documents and 

signed JEVs of both check payments and telegraphic payments/transfers 

were not timely submitted to this office. Likewise, the Audit Team could not 

timely verify completeness and accuracy of liquidation documents due to its 

late submission. 
 

 

b. General Journals 
 

3.5. Also, the various adjusting and Tax Remittance Advices (TRAs) entries 
made remained unsupported since the General Journal (GJ) with its 

supporting documents and signed JEVs for the months of January to 

November were not transmitted to the Audit Team for review and validation.  
 

 

c. Trial Balances and Financial Statements 
 

3.6. Both campuses of PNU-Manila and PNU-South Luzon were not able to 
timely submit the duly signed/certified consolidated and per fund cluster 

Monthly Trial Balances and Quarterly Financial Statements and their 

supporting schedules for the CY 2020 as required by Section 60.c, Chapter 1, 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

3.7. The Audit Team is taking into consideration the Enhanced Community 
Quarantine (ECQ) lockdown and the safety protocol measures amidst the 

current pandemic, nevertheless the submission of the required financial 

reports and their supporting documents is required so as not to hamper the 

audit procedures to be carried out by the Audit Team as mandated by this 

Commission.  

 

3.8. Consequently, the non-submission of the financial records and their 
supporting documents barred the timely audit thereof, thus the validity, 

propriety, accuracy, and legality of the Management’s financial transactions 

could not be established. 

 

 

 

 



100 

 

3.9. We recommended that Management: 
 

PNU-Manila 

a. submit immediately all the DVs settled thru check payments 
and telegraphic transfers/payments, LRs and GJs with their 

supporting documents and the signed JEVs for CY 2020; 

 

b. submit the certified/signed Consolidated and Per Fund Cluster 
(Regular Agency Fund, Internally Generated Income and 

Trust Fund) Monthly Trial Balances and Quarterly Financial 

Statements and their supporting schedules for CY 2020; and 

 

c. implement Section 122 of PD No. 1445 on the withholding of 
salary of the officials and employees responsible for the non-

submission of the financial records and their supporting 

documents/schedules if it is justifiable. 

 

PNU-South Luzon 

d. thru the Accountant, immediately submit the CY 2020 yearend 
financial statements and the related supporting schedules to 

the Office of the Auditor.  Henceforth, adhere strictly to 

Section 60, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I on the 

timely submission of yearend financial statements. 

 

3.10. The Management comments and the Auditor’s Rejoinders, are as follows: 
 

Management’s Comments Auditor’s Rejoinder 

PNU-Manila  

The Accounting Unit submitted the LRs last 

February 2021 while the DVs thru checks payments 

and telegraphic transfers/payment, (LRs), Monthly 

Trial Balances, and Quarterly Financial Statements 

for CY 2020 with its pertinent supporting 

documents and signed JEVs in March 2021. 

GJs for the non-cash transactions and 

adjustments and supporting schedules 

for the quarterly financial statements 

for CY 2020 which are also being 

required for submission are not yet 

received by the Audit Team. 

PNU South Luzon  

The Accounting staff alleged that the delay was 

attributed to the instructions made by the Head, 

Financial Management Services of PNU Head 

Office to close the existing Trust Fund Account 

(Fund 416) and consolidate the same with the STF 

account at yearend.  There was complication since 

they are adopting a computerized system and said 

task requires various processes.  The Accounting 

staff, however, promised to comply with the 

regulations on the timely submission of FSs to the 

Audit Team in the ensuing year. 

The Management duly noted the 

observations and recommendations. 

 



101 

 

Improper filing of submitted DVs, RCDs and GJs 

 

4. The PNU-Manila’s submitted Reports on Collections and Deposits (RCDs), DVs 
and GJs were inaptly filed, labelled and indexed, thus impeding the Audit Team 

to verify and carry out properly its mandated function to safeguard and 

preserve the agency’s records for a minimum of 10 years in consonance with 

Section 43, Chapter 1 of PD No. 1445. 

 

4.1. Section 43 (4) Chapter 1, PD No. 1445 mandates that “the auditors in all 
auditing units shall have the custody and be responsible for the safekeeping 

and preservation of paid expense vouchers, journal vouchers, stubs of 

treasury warrants or checks, reports of collections and disbursements and 

similar documents, together with their respective supporting papers, under 

regulations of the Commission.” 

 

4.2. While Section 26 thereof, on General Jurisdiction, states, among others, the 
following: “The authority and powers of the Commission shall extend to and 

comprehend all matters relating to auditing procedures, systems and 

controls, the keeping of the general accounts of the Government, the 

preservation of vouchers pertaining thereto for a period of ten years-xxx” 

(Underscoring supplied) 

 

4.3. Further, for this Commission to adhere to the aforecited law, Section 20 (1), 
also of Chapter 1, PD No. 1445 states that “there shall be in each agency of 

the government an auditing unit which shall be provided by the audited 

agency with a suitable and sufficient office space together with supplies, 

equipment, furniture, and other necessary operating expenses for its proper 

maintenance, including expenses for travel and transportation.” 

(Underscoring supplied) 

 

4.4. In compliance with the audit recommendations reflected in AOM No. 2020-
020 (20) dated December 17, 2020 issued to PNU-Manila relative to the non-

submission of required financial reports and their supporting 

documents/schedules for CY 2020, the Accounting Unit submitted the DVs 

of both Checks and List of Due and Demandable Accounts Payable-Advice 

to Debit Account (LDDAP-ADA) and GJs along with pertinent signed JEVs 

and supporting documents for CY 2020. In addition, RCD/ORs were also 

submitted to the Team. However, the documents submitted were inaptly filed 

and inadequately labeled, thus the probability of such documents to 

withstand wear and tear for 10 years may be lessened. Details of the noted 

observations, as well as other deficiencies, are discussed as follows: 

 
Table 34: Observations on Filing of Submitted Documents of PNU-Manila 

Document Observations 

Reports of 

Collections and 

In the previous years, the RCDs were submitted intact 

and properly filed/labelled. However, for CY 2020, all 



102 

 

Document Observations 

Deposits 

 

submitted RCDs were forwarded to this Office in loose-

leaves and compiled using rubber bands only while the 

ORs are bound by binder clips, thus susceptible to get 

detached/lost or tear up. Moreover, JEVs are not signed 

raising the probability that collections and deposits are 

not recorded in the books. 

Disbursement 

Vouchers 

 

Submitted DVs are at risk of easy deterioration and 

detachment due to the following: 
 

a. Overfilling - the files are stacked up almost to the 
brink of the metal fasteners to which the ends were 

bended to lock the documents in place, making the 

vouching of documents strenuous. Also, the metal 

fasteners are bound to unclamp once these files are 

flipped. 

b. Usage of metal fasteners – due to the fastener’s 
sharp edges, the papers are at a risk of tearing up 

and getting detached from the compilation upon 

turning the pages. 

c. Topped by ordinary folder – each compilation is 
covered on top by an ordinary folder while no 

cover was placed at the bottom, thus the 

documents are not sufficiently protected.  
 

In addition, each compilation does not provide for a 

summary or top schedule showing the following details, 

for easy reference of the contents thereof: 
 

a. Check / LDDAP-ADA Date 
b. Check / LDDAP-ADA Serial Number 
c. DV Reference Number 
d. Obligation and Request Status (ORS) / Budget 

Utilization and Request Status Reference Number 

e. Payee 
f. Amount Paid 
g. Nature of Payment 
h. JEVs Reference Number 

 

Even if the Accounting Unit attaches the Report of 

Checks Issued (RCI) or Report of Advice to Debit 

Account Issued (RADAI) per month, still, this will not 

suffice, as it does not specify to which compilation a 

specific DV is included. 

General Journals 

 

GAM for NGAs, Volume II prescribes the GJ as 

follows: “shall be maintained in the Accounting 

Division/Unit by fund cluster and only transactions not 



103 

 

Document Observations 

recorded in the Special Journals shall be recorded 

thereto.”  However, under e-NGAS, the GJ entails all 

entries made involving disbursements, collections, 

liquidations, adjustments, and other non-cash related 

journal entries. Nonetheless, the Management is still 

required to submit signed JEVs and its supporting 

documents for the adjustments and non-cash 

transactions made in the books. Likewise, it should be 

properly filed, compiled, and submitted to the Audit 

Team in the same manner as the DVs. 

 

4.5. The non-availability of ring binders prompted the PNU-Manila Accounting 
Office to submit to COA, the aforementioned document files, which were 

secured only with metal fasteners and ordinary folders. The lack of ring 

binders could have been avoided had the Supply and Property Unit 

monitored regularly the usage and availability of essential supplies to address 

the needs of the Accounting Unit.  

 

4.6. The safekeeping and preservation of various documents in furtherance of our 
mandated function necessitates the provision by the audited agency of proper 

supplies to enable adherence thereto. Likewise, the Accounting Unit is 

enjoined to submit properly filed RCD/ORs, DVs and GJs in ring binders 

with appropriate labels and top sheet/summary of contents to facilitate audit 

and for the protection of Agency’s records.  

 

4.7. We recommended that Management:  
 

a. assign an Accounting staff to reorganize the filing of DVs, RCDs 
and ORs, GJs files submitted to COA by (i) replacing the metal 

fasteners and folders with ring binders and (ii) indicating the 

appropriate labels of each file, and, henceforth ensure the proper 

submission of documents; 

 

b. thru the Supply and Property Unit (SPU), provide the Accounting 
Unit with ring binders and other necessary supplies to enable the 

proper filing of documents before its submission to the Audit 

Team; 

 

c. provide RCI or Report of Advice to Debit Account Issued 
(RADAI) on the 1st binder of the month and attach the summary 

of content per binder indicating the following details: 

 

 Check / LDDAP-ADA Date 
 Check / LDDAP-ADA Serial Number 
 Disbursement Vouchers Reference Number 



104 

 

 Obligation and Request Status (ORS) / Budget Utilization 
and Request Status Reference Number 

 Payee 
 Amount Paid 
 Nature of Payment 
 JEV Reference Number 

 

d. submit the signed JEVs corresponding to the Report of Collections 
and Deposits, as attachment thereto; and 

 

e. submit signed JEVs with supporting documents for adjustments 
and other non-cash transactions. 

 

4.8. The Management commented that the Accounting Unit will comply with the 
requirements of the COA Audit Team. The Accounting Unit already 

organized and filed the DV, RCD, OR and GJ while the Supply Unit adjusted 

the number of needed binders for the current year to address the needs of the 

University. Furthermore, recommendations (c) and (e) will be prospectively 

complied by the Accounting Unit. 

 

 

Unauthorized retention of unutilized/excess funds to Cash in Bank – Local Currency, 

Current Account (CIB-LCCA) - ₱32,323,562.02 

 

5. Out of ₱172,750,003.05 Cash NT-MDS transferred by PNU-Manila to the CIB- 
LCCA of PNU-Mindanao and PNU-North Luzon campuses for their  operating 

requirements, ₱32,323,562.02 remained unutilized and unreverted to the 

Bureau of the Treasury (BTr). Furthermore, the ₱5,269,143.27 which was 

deposited by PNU-Mindanao to the STF account of PNU Manila in CY 2019 is 

still unremitted to the BTr, contrary to existing laws, rules and regulations 

resulting in the accumulation of idle funds that could have been utilized for 

other government programs. 

 

5.1. Section 10, General Provisions of GAA for FY 2020 (RA No. 11465) states: 
 

“Reversion, closure and transfer of Balances of Special Accounts, 

Fiduciary or Trust Funds, Revolving Funds, and Unauthorized 

Accounts.  Departments, bureaus, offices and instrumentalities of the 

National Government, including Constitutional Commissions enjoying 

fiscal autonomy and SUCs are mandated to close and revert all 

balances of Special Accounts, Fiduciary or Trust Funds, and 

Revolving Funds to the General Fund in any of the following 

instances: (i ) when there is no legal basis for its creation; (ii) when 

their terms have expired’ or (iii) when they are no longer necessary 

for the attainment of the purposes for which said funds were 

established.  



105 

 

xxx 

 

Said agencies shall likewise transfer to the National Treasury all 

balances of unauthorized accounts with any banking institution. 

Unauthorized accounts shall refer to cash account balances 

maintained by agencies without legal basis or those while legally 

authorized are maintained outside of the National Treasury in 

violation of law.” 

 

5.2. EO No. 431 dated May 30, 2005 prescribes the reversion of all dormant 
accounts, unnecessary Special and Trust Funds to the GF and for other 

purposes. It provides that: 

 

“All government offices and agencies, unless otherwise specifically 

provided by law, to immediately transfer all public monies deposited 

with depository banks and other institutions to the Bureau of Treasury 

or in any authorized depository of the government and shall accrue to 

the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund of the Government.” 

 

5.3. Section 6 of DOF-DBM-COA Permanent Committee JC No. 4-2012 
provides that: 

 

“The heads of the departments, bureaus and agencies of the National 

Government shall have the following responsibilities: 

 

6.1.  Cooperate, open their books of accounts and assist the 

Permanent Committee and its authorized representatives in the 

conduct of inspection and review of their cash balances; 

 

6.2. Provide the Permanent Committee with the required 

information and instruct their officials concerned to effect the 

smooth and efficient transfer to the National Treasury of the 

cash balances of unauthorized accounts.” 

 

5.4. In addition, COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015 sets out the 
guidelines and procedures in the reversion to the GF of all Dormant Cash, 

Unauthorized Accounts, Unnecessary Special and Trust Funds and Related 

Accounts, in conformity with Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-

2012 dated September 11, 2012, implementing EO No. 431 dated May 30, 

2005.  

 

5.5. Furthermore, Item II (d) of Treasury Circular No. 01-2013 dated January 23, 
2013 provides that deposit account maintained with Authorized Government 

Depository Bank (AGDB) for funding checks shall be discontinued and 

closed pursuant to NBC No. 488 dated May 22, 2003. 

 



106 

 

5.6. Item 2.3 of the DBM Circular Letter No. 2019-03 dated January 4, 2019 
provides that all NCA balances of regular Modified Disbursement System 

(MDS) Sub-Accounts at the end of each quarter are considered lapsed after 

the last working hour of said quarter. 

 

5.7. PNU-Mindanao and PNU-North Luzon campuses received cash allocations 
from PNU-Manila for its operational requirements in CY 2020 through 

funding checks to the respective CIB-LCCA despite the recommendation 

made in the CY 2019 Consolidated Annual Audit Report that all campuses 

should open an MDS account. With this funding strategy, any unutilized 

amount of PYs’ and the lapsed allocation for CY 2020 will not be reverted 

automatically to the BTr, instead, reversion of fund shall be made by issuing 

check payments corresponding to the unutilized amount to be 

deposited/remitted to the BTr. 

 

5.8. As at yearend, the CIB-LCCA accounts under the Regular Agency Fund of 
PNU-Mindanao and PNU-North Luzon disclosed amounts of ₱19,363,065.60 

and ₱15,476,754.55, respectively. 

 

5.9. Out of the outstanding fund amounting to ₱15,476,754.55 of PNU-North 
Luzon, ₱2,516,258.13 was reflected to be unpaid obligations both in the 

Budget Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs) and Trial Balance (TB), 

resulting in an unexpended Cash in Bank of ₱12,960,496.42, which does not 

have existing claimants or valid payables/obligations and should be 

immediately remitted to the BTr pursuant to the above-cited provisions.  

 

5.10. Moreover, PNU-Mindanao deposited part of its unexpended balance 
amounting to ₱5,269,143.27 to the Main Campus’ CIB-LCCA for its STF in 

CY 2019 as required by PNU-Manila. However, the latter did not provide 

evidence that the same was already remitted to the BTr. 

 

5.11. Furthermore, the accumulation of cash balance in the entity’s accounts 
denied the government of the use thereof for implementing various programs 

that needed appropriate funding.  

 

5.12. We recommended that Management: 
 

PNU-Manila 

a. initiate action to ensure the opening of MDS Account by the 
campuses for the direct downloading of funds for their operational 

requirements thru Notice of Transfer of Cash Allocation instead of 

thru funding checks deposited in the LCCA account; 

 

b. revert to the BTr the ₱5,269,143.27 funds transferred by PNU- 
Mindanao to its STF account, with certified true copy of the 



107 

 

documents evidencing deposit made furnished that Campus and 

the Audit Team; 

 

PNU-Mindanao 

c. coordinate with PNU-Manila on the opening of MDS Account and 
request from PNU-Manila a certified copy of the deposit made to 

the BTr relative to the reversion/remittance of ₱5,269,143.27 funds 

transferred thru their STF account; 

 

d. thru its Accountant, remit to the BTr, not to PNU Manila, the 
unexpended fund balance, in compliance with Section 10, General 

Provisions of GAA for FY 2020 (RA No. 11465); and 

 

PNU-North Luzon 

e. thru the Accountant, return the unutilized and idle funds 
amounting to ₱12,960,496.42 to the BTr pursuant to EO No. 431 

dated May 30, 2005, COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 

29, 2015 and DOF-DBM-COA Permanent Committee JC No. 4-

2012 dated September 11, 2012.  

 

5.13. The Management’s comments are as follows: 
 

5.14. The PNU-Mindanao campus is still receiving funding checks from PNU-
Manila instead of opening an MDS Account mainly because the Campus 

cannot have a direct line with the DBM as PNU has a centralized budget 

system.  Secondly, the reportorial requirements of the DBM and the BTr 

cannot be addressed due to the limited manpower in the Finance Unit of the 

Campus.  However, the Management will coordinate with PNU-Manila and 

the concerned agencies for possible actions on the matter. 

 

5.15. Further, as to the excess cash allocation that was returned in CY 2019 by 
PNU-Mindanao, inquiry with PNU-Manila disclosed that the amount was not 

deposited to the BTr as PNU-Manila had outstanding payables to their 

suppliers/creditors from the PYs of 2019. As per PNU-Manila’s analysis, 

excess cash allocations were accumulated in the Campuses, hence the order 

to return the excess cash allocations to be deposited to their account.  The 

returned excess cash allocations were deposited to PNU Manila’s STF 

account as they maintained the MDS Account for their GAA Fund. 

 

5.16. Moreover, PNU-Mindanao’s cash allocation analysis of the remaining Cash 
in Bank, especially from prior years, is still a work in progress requiring 

reconciliation with the accumulated balances of Payable accounts. 

Corresponding reversion will be made once balances are verified. 

 

 

 



108 

 

Unliquidated overdue Cash advances amounting to ₱2,552,621.13 

 

6. The total cash advances of PNU-Manila amounting to ₱1,795,270.47 recorded 
under Advances for Payroll, Advances to Special Disbursing Officer, and 

Advances to Officers and Employees accounts are composed of cash advances 

already overdue for liquidation amounting to ₱1,641,112.22 and had 

accumulated due to non-compliance with COA Circular Nos. 97-002 and 2012-

001 dated February 10, 1997 and June 14, 2012, respectively. 

 

6.1. Sections 4.1.3 and 5 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 
and Section 1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 demand 

the liquidation of Traveling Expenses within 30 days after the return of the 

official/employee to his local station from local travel and within 60 days 

after the return of the official/employee to the Philippines from foreign 

travel. On the other hand, cash advances for special purpose should be 

liquidated as soon as its purpose has been served. 

 

6.2. Whereas Section 5.8 of COA Circular No. 97-002 provides that “All cash 
advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year. Except for petty 

cash fund, the AO shall refund any unexpended balance to the 

Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipt.” 

 

6.3. Failure of the AOs to comply with the reglementary period to liquidate 
constitutes a valid cause for the withholding of his/her salary as warranted by 

Section 5.1 of the same Circular. 

 

6.4. Furthermore, it is stated in Section 4.1.8 that the Accountant shall ensure that 
cash advances for a particular year are not used to pay expenses incurred in 

another year while Section 1.0.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 states that 

“No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official or employee 

unless the previous cash advance given to him is first liquidated and 

accounted for in the books.” 

 

6.5. The same is stated under PD No. 1445, as follows: 
 

“Section 89. Limitations on cash advance. No cash advance shall be 

given unless for a legally authorized specific purpose. A cash advance 

shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it 

was given has been served. No additional cash advance shall be 

allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance 

given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.” 

 

6.6. Review of PNU-Manila’s SLs of Advances for Payroll (AFP), Advances to 
Officers and Employees (AOE) and Advances to Special Disbursing Officers 

(ASDO), together with the Status of Outstanding Cash Advances as at 



109 

 

yearend disclosed that the ₱1,795,270.47 total cash advances contained the 

following deficiencies:

6.7. A total amount of ₱354,158.25 unliquidated cash advances granted to five 
AOs are due for liquidation in year 2021, nevertheless, Section 5.8 of COA 

Circular No. 97-002 specifically directed all AOs to fully liquidate at the end 

of each year and refund the unexpended balance. This is to aid the 

Accountant in ensuring that the cash advances for a particular year are not 

used as payment for the expenses of a different year as prescribed in Section 

4.1.8 of the same Circular. 

 

6.8. Data provided by the Accounting Unit showed that the aforementioned AOs 
submitted their Liquidation Reports (LRs) to the Accounting Unit, however 

these were returned to them due to lack of necessary signatures.  The refunds 

were made in January 2021, thus will be recorded in the University’s books 

in CY 2021. 

 

6.9. Cash advances which are overdue for liquidation are perennial observations 
of the Audit Team despite previous issuances of Audit Observation 

Memoranda (AOM) regarding this matter, yet there are certain AOs who did 

not adhere thereto, resulting in an aggregated amount of ₱1,641,112.22 or 

82.25 percent cash advances overdue for liquidation at yearend, illustrated as 

follows:

6.11. Inquiry with the Accounting Unit revealed that as at yearend, the listed AOs 
below with cash advances overdue for liquidation totaling ₱415,053.75 

submitted their LRs but were returned to them due to lack of necessary 

signatures and non-inclusion of ORs evidencing the refund of their unutilized 

cash advances, which kept their accountabilities outstanding as of the 

reporting date.

6.12. This Office took into consideration of the intent of the four AOs to submit 
LRs to clear their accountabilities. On the other hand, Demand Letters were 

issued on January 26-27, 2021 to the other AOs with overdue cash advances. 

Also, scanned copies of the Demand Letters were sent to their respective 

Office emails on January 27, 2021 for their easy reference. 

  

6.13. The inaction/non-liquidation and unjustified delay in the liquidation of the 
AOs’ outstanding cash advances despite the formal Demand Letters issued 

by the Audit Team is sanctioned by Section 5 of the Civil Service 

Commission Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 23, series of 2019 pursuant to 

CSC Resolution No. 1900929 dated August 13, 2019.  

 

6.14. Meanwhile, as a result of the repetitive non-compliance and disregard by the 
Management of the provisions of Section 89 of PD No. 1445 and Section 

1.0.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-001, prohibiting the grant of additional 

cash advances to an AO whose previous accountabilities are not yet settled, 

Mr. Vergara’s unliquidated cash advances summed up to eight grants totaling 

₱487,222.98, which represents 24.42 percent of the total audited outstanding 

cash advances. Consequently, unliquidated cash advances continue to 

increase yearly, as illustrated below: 

 
Table 39: Yearly Unliquidated Cash Advances of Mr. Vergara 

Particulars 2012 2014 2015 2018 2019 2020 

Total Amount of 

Unliquidated CAs 

₱ 91,138.00 ₱ 110,939.00 ₱ 170,392.00 ₱ 358,392.00 ₱ 458,392.00 ₱ 487,222.98 

% of Yearly Increase  21.73 53.59 110.33 27.90 6.29 

 

6.15. The Management kept on approving the grant of cash advances to Mr. 
Vergara, without being alarmed on his increasing accountabilities, by not 

ensuring that the AO will liquidate previous cash advances prior to the 

receipt of a new cash advance.  

 

6.16. We recommended that PNU-Manila Management: 
 

a. require the concerned AOs to provide valid justification for the 
delay in the liquidation despite formal Demand Letters received 

from the Audit Team Leader of COA, as basis in rendering a 

decision in audit, whether to suspend or disallow the unliquidated 

cash advances;  

 

b. act accordingly for the immediate liquidation of the overdue cash 
advances, impose sanction, if warranted, and present to the Audit 

Team evidence of the action taken by Management on those AOs 

who failed to liquidate; and 

 



113 

 

c. stop granting of multiple cash advances or of additional cash 
advance to an AO with previous unliquidated ones, to faithfully 

take care of the government funds and safeguard government 

property from wastage as provided for in Section 2 of PD No. 

1445. 

 

6.17. Management commented that the AU already issued three notices (March 1, 
10, and 20, 2021) to the concerned officers regarding the settlement of their 

cash advances.  

 

 

Erroneous deposit and accounting of refunds of cash advances and collections 

 

7. In PNU-North Luzon, refunds of cash advances and scholarship allowance 
granted from GF and TF amounting to ₱57,271.12 were inaccurately deposited 

in the STF and recorded as School Fees instead of depositing to/recording in the 

corresponding fund where these were granted and reverting to the BTr the 

refunds for GF of ₱13,340.00. Also, payment of disallowed claim of ₱17,706.91 

was deposited to the TF instead of reverting to the BTr, while STF collections 

totaling ₱431,368.50 were erroneously deposited to TF. 

 

7.1. The total refunds amounting to ₱57,271.12 were deposited in the STF, but 
which should have been deposited and accounted for in the respective source 

funds, as follows: 
 

Table 40: Summary Refunds of PNU-North Luzon 

per Source Fund Cluster 

Fund 
Amount of Refund 

(In Pesos) 

General Fund 13,340.00 

Trust Fund 43,931.12 

Total 57,271.12 

  

7.2. Inquiry with the Accountant, on the recording of collections of refund, 
revealed that these were credited directly to School Fees-Refund which is a 

revenue for the entity. This is contrary to proper accounting because refund 

of CAs can never be treated as revenue. Hence, the following adjustments 

should be recorded: 

 

Special Trust Fund 
  Accumulated Surplus Dr ₱   11,790.00 

  School fees-refund Dr 1,550.00 

 Cash in Bank, LCCA Cr ₱  13,340.00

advance from General Fund and payment to BTr

erroneously deposited in STF. 

 

7.3. In addition, the Audit Team noted that the payment of disallowance of Ms. 
Marissa Guiab amounting to ₱17,706.91, with OR No. 503108 dated July 10, 

2019 was deposited to the TF instead of returning the same to the account of 

the BTr. Further, on August 19, 2019, the entity issued Check No. 565276 

from the GF amounting to ₱55,118.42, to cover the settlement of 

disallowance of PNU Employees that were deducted from their salaries 

including the cash payment of Ms. Guiab. However, it was later found out 

that the settlement of disallowance pertaining to Ms. Guiab was not 

transferred to the GF account but was still kept in the TF. 

 

7.4. This is tantamount to the transferring of funds from one fund cluster to 
another without any legal basis. It has been clearly communicated in the 

previous findings that any unutilized amount in the GF should be returned to 

the BTr. As such, the amount of ₱13,340.00 should be immediately returned 

to the BTr and likewise, the amount of ₱43,931.12 should be deposited to 

TF. In addition, the amount of ₱17,706.91 in the TF covering the payment of 

disallowance of Ms. Guiab should be transferred to the GF. 

 

7.5. Likewise, the Audit Team observed that some collections were not deposited 
and recorded consistently in accordance with their nature and classification.   

The amount of ₱431,368.50 was deposited under TF instead of STF which 

contravenes CHED Memorandum No. 20 series of 2011, details below: 
 

Table 41: Erroneous Deposit of STF Collections to Trust Fund

Total ₱ 168,875.00 ₱ 431,368.50   

 

 



115 

 

7.6. CMO No. 20 series of 2011 defined the Regular TFand STF as: 
 

“Regular Trust Fund-refers to a fund which is governed by law such 

as NSTP (NSTP Law), ROTC (ROTC Law), Publication, SSG and 

Alumni Funds and the like provided under RA No. 8292. However, the 

funds for NSTP and ROTC are integrated in the depository account of 

the Special Trust Fund as it cannot create an organic structure which 

provides for accountable officers, unlike the Publication, SSG and 

Alumni Funds which have accountable officers to manage the fund and 

are allowed to open their depository account. 

 

Special Trust Fund-refers to income of the SUC arising from the 

collection of tuition fees, miscellaneous fees, service and other income. 

This is broken into: 

 

1. Tuition fees for use by the SUC in carrying out its trifocal 
function: instruction, research and extension, and production, as 

well as defray its administrative costs (general administrative 

support); 

2. Fiduciary fund; 
3. Revenues collected by self-liquidating units; 
4. Revenues generated by income-generating units; 
5. Regular and other Trust Fund without separate depository 

account (NSTP, ROTC, NEDA or DOST Funding or other NGA 

Funding for the implementation of projects through the State 

College). 

 

7.7. The Accountant should issue a billing/order of payment to the Cashier to 
serve as a basis in the issuance of receipt of collections, to ensure proper 

accounting of funds on where collections are to be deposited. Likewise, 

collections of the same nature should be accounted for in the corresponding 

funds created for the purpose to ensure proper accounting and reporting of 

financial transactions thereof. This will avoid the mixing of funds that could 

create confusion in the monitoring and accounting of fund balances.  

 

7.8. We recommended, and PNU-North Luzon agreed: 
 

a. thru the Accountant and the Cashier, to make the necessary 
transfer and accounting entries for refunds and collections from 

STF to GF and TR in the amounts of ₱13,340.00 and ₱43,931.12, 

respectively, and from TR to STF amounting to ₱431,368.50, and 

remit to the BTr the refund of P13,340.00 under GF and payment 

of ₱17,706.91to settle the disallowance; 

 

b. see to it that future refunds of CAs and allowances should not be 
recorded as revenue, instead, these transactions should be 



116 

 

analyzed thoroughly to ensure that the same are properly 

recorded and accounted for in the correct fund: and 

 

c. ensure that collections are deposited in accordance with CMO       

No. 20 series of 2011 for the proper accounting in the books of 

accounts and thru the Accountant, issue billing/order of payment 

to the payor as prerequisite in the acceptance of payment by the 

Cashier as required in Sec. 40, Chapter 5 of the GAM for NGAS 

Volume 1.   
 

Management’s Comment  

 

7.9. During the Exit Conference, the PNU-North Luzon Management stated that 
adjustments were already made, and instructions were already given to the 

Cashier on the proper treatment for future refunds of cash advances. As 

regards the disallowance of Ms. Guiab, it is currently under review and is 

expected to be resolved by the end of 2nd quarter of CY 2021. 

 

 

INVENTORIES 

 

Non-maintenance of Stock Cards (SC)/Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) and submission of 

deficient RPCI 

 

8. The Accountant and Supply Officer of PNU-North Luzon do not maintain 
Supplies Ledger Card and Stock Cards, respectively, while PNU-Mindanao 

submitted an incomplete RPCI, contrary to Sections 9 and 17.i, Chapter 8 of the 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

8.1. Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides the instructions, rules 
and regulations on the maintenance of reports for the Inventory accounts, to 

wit: 

 

“Sec. 9. Perpetual Inventory Method. Supplies and materials 

purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual 

inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a 

running total for the cost of goods sold in each period. The system 

requires accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand 

at all times through the maintenance of the SLC (Appendix 57) by the 

Accounting Division/Unit and Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) by the 

Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock. Regular 

purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and issues 

thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for supplies and 

materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on emergency 

cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense 

accounts” (Emphasis supplied) 



117 

 

“Sec. 17. Records, Forms and Reports to be prepared and/or 

maintained. The following records, forms and reports are prescribed 

for use: 

 

b.  Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) – shall be used to record all 

receipts and issues of supplies and the balance in quantity at any 

time. It shall be maintained by the Property and/or Supply 

Division/Unit for each item in stock. The IAR, RIS, PO and DR 

serve as the original sources of information for making entries on 

the card. 

 

i.  Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) (Appendix 66) 

– shall be used to report the physical count of supplies by type of 

inventory as at a given date. It shows the balance of inventory 

items per card and per count and shortage/overage, if any. These 

include the semi-expendable property wherein the issue is covered 

by ICS.” 

 

8.2. It was noted that the Accountant and the Supply Officer of PNU-North 
Luzon is not maintaining any SLC and SC, respectively. 

 

8.3. Likewise, the RPCI of PNU-Mindanao was submitted late to the Audit Team 
since the conduct of physical count of inventories was done after the 

prescribed date of submission. Furthermore, the submitted RPCI excludes the 

inventory of the semi-expendable inventories. 

 

8.4. In view of the foregoing deficiencies, the monitoring of movement of the 
supplies and materials will be difficult that may result in undetected missing 

inventories. 

 

8.5. We recommended that Management: 
 

PNU-North Luzon 

a. thru the Accountant and Supply Officer, maintain SLC and SC, 
respectively, for more accurate inventory records pursuant to 

Sections 7 and 9, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; and 

 

PNU-Mindanao 

b. thru the Inventory Committee, prioritize the conduct of physical 
count of all inventories, the result thereof to be documented by a 

well-prepared RPCI. 

 

8.6. The Management of PNU-Mindanao will see to it that the conduct of the 
physical count of PPE will be given priority. The Management already 

included the physical count of inventories in the institutional priorities to 

guarantee the on-time submission of reports.   



118 

 

Transferred Balance of PNU-Mindanao’s Inter-Agency fund transfers to its IGF 

 

9. Receipts of PNU-Mindanao from other agencies totaling ₱10,976,439.06 under 
the Due to NGAs account in the Trust Receipts Fund (TRF) Cluster was 

transferred to and reported under the Internally Generated Fund (IGF) Cluster 

as advised by PNU-Manila, contrary to the UACS Manual and Appendix P, 

GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 

9.1. Chapter 1.2.8 of the UACS Manual defines Trust Receipts, as follows: 
 

“Trust Receipts are receipts that are officially in the possession of 

government agencies or a public officer as trustee, agent, or 

administrator, or which have been received for the fulfillment of a 

particular obligation.” 

 

9.2. These receipts may be classified as: 
 

“Inter-Agency Transferred Funds (IATF), which are receipts or fund 

transfers from any government-agency or Government Owned and/or 

Controlled Corporations (GOCC) to another agency, and which are 

deposited in the National Treasury to facilitate project 

implementation; 

 

Receipts deposited with the National Treasury other than IATF, 

which are receipts from other sources—including private persons or 

foreign institutions—which are deposited with the National Treasury, 

pursuant to E.O. No. 338, for the fulfillment of some obligations; and,  

 

Receipts deposited with Authorized Government Depository Bank 

(AGDB), which are receipts from other sources that should be 

deposited in the AGDB for the fulfillment of some obligations.” 

 

9.3. Verification disclosed that the accounts under the TRs were closed and 
transferred to the IGF including the transferred accounts from other NGAs 

totaling ₱10,976,439.06 under the Due to NGAs account. 

 

9.4. The Accountant informed that there was an instruction from PNU-Manila to 
close the TRs and transfer the balances to IGF as of yearend to properly 

classify the accounts.  However, the Accountant inadvertently included the 

receipts from other agencies for the fulfilment of obligations, as follows: 

 
Table 42: Trust Receipts of PNU-Mindanao Transferred to IGF 

Description Amount 

CHED-CARAGA Scholarship Grant ₱      1,542,00.00 

CHED-IDIG 2018 7,268,555.14

119 

 

Description Amount 

CHED-Salikha, Mga Tingog sa Kamingawan 2,136,004.27 

Total ₱  10,976,439.06 

 

9.5. Further verification disclosed that the completed CSIS Survey with 
unexpended amount of ₱29,879.65 still remained in the books and was not 

returned to the source agency, DILG, as at yearend. 

 

9.6. It is emphasized that the receipts from other NGAs/sources for the fulfilment 
of specific purposes like the research projects and scholarship funds from the 

different agencies deposited in the account of the Campus need to be 

accounted in a separate fund or the Trust Receipts fund. 

 

9.7. Based on the foregoing, the Due to NGAs account was erroneously recorded 
in the IGF instead of the original TRF, resulting in misclassification of 

accounts. 

 

9.8. We recommended, and PNU-Mindanao Management agreed, thru the 
Accountant, to: 

 

a. discuss with the Chief Accountant of PNU-Manila on the proper 
classification of Funds and Fund Cluster where they belong 

specifically those received from other agencies as trust receipts; 

and 

 

b. account and report under Fund Cluster-Trust Receipts the TRs 
funds received from other agencies as Due to NGAs account 

totaling ₱10,976,439.06 pursuant to Chapter 1.2.8 of the UACS 

Manual and Section 5, Chapter 19 and Appendix P, GAM for 

NGAs, Vol. I. 
 

 

Various payments without proper documentation and/or legal basis - ₱5,932,880.66 

 

10. Various disbursements incurred by PNU in the aggregate amount of 
₱5,932,880.66 were paid despite inadequate supporting documents and/or 

without legal basis, hence casting doubts on the validity, propriety and 

reasonableness of claims. 
 

10.1. Section 2 of PD No. 1445 provides that: 
 

“It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the 

government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance 

with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage 

through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring 

efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. 



120 

 

The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to 

rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency 

concerned.” 

 

10.2. While Section 4 of the same provision provides that disbursements or 
disposition of government funds or property shall: (1) invariably bear the 

approval of the proper officials; (2) claims against government funds shall be 

supported with complete documentation; and (3) all laws and regulations 

applicable to financial transactions shall be faithfully adhered to. 

 

10.3. Likewise, COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribes the 
documentary requirements for common government transactions. Included 

therein is the provision, among others, that claims against government funds 

shall be supported with complete documentation. 

 

10.4. Meanwhile, COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012 prescribes 
the Updated Guidelines for the prevention and disallowance of Irregular, 

Unnecessary, Excessive, Extravagant and Unconscionable Expenditures. 

 

10.5. The noted observations on the various disbursement transactions incurred by 
PNU Campuses are summarized below and discussed in succeeding

10.6. Results of the post-audit of transactions in PNU-Visayas and PNU-Mindanao 
for CY 2020 revealed that various disbursements totaling ₱946,617.90 were 

paid despite the absence of complete supporting documents, in violation of 



121 

 

Section 4 (6) of PD No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 

14, 2012. Details are presented as follows: 

 

 

a.1. Lacking supporting documents for the payment of monetization of leave credits 
in the amount of ₱571,617.90 in PNU-Visayas  

 

10.7. Section 5.14 of COA Circular No. 2012-01 dated June 14, 2012 provides for 
the Documentary Requirements for monetization, as follows: 

 

a. Approved leave application (ten days) with leave credit balance 
certified by the Human Resource Office 

b. Request for leave covering more than ten days duly approved by 
the Head of Agency 

c. For monetization of 50 percent or more: 

 Clinical abstract/medical procedures to be undertaken in case 
of health, medical and hospital needs 

 Barangay Certification in case of need for financial assistance 
brought about by calamities, typhoons, fire, etc. 

 
10.8. The payment of monetization by PNU-Visayas to its administrative Staff for 

CY 2020 amounting to ₱571,617.90 under PR No. 2020-11-045 is only 

supported by a DV and a payroll contravening Section 5.14 of COA Circular 

No. 2012-01 dated June 14, 2012. 

 

10.9. The absence of the required documents prevented the evaluation of the 
Agency’s compliance on the rules on the monetization of leave credits 

provided under the Omnibus Rules on Leave, specially that 6 out of 11 

payees exceeds the maximum of 30 days allowed annual regular 

monetization. 

 

 

a.2. Incomplete documentation for the payment of Collective Negotiation Agreement 
(CNA) Incentive in PNU-Mindanao in the amount of ₱375,000.00 

 

10.10. Section 5.1 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-5 dated November 4, 2020 
enumerates the procedural guidelines on the grant of the CNA Incentive for 

FY 2020. 
 

10.11. In relation to the above DBM guidelines, Section 5.16 of COA Circular No. 
2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 enumerated the documentary requirements,    

as follows: 

 

a. Resolution signed by both parties incorporating the 
guidelines/criteria for granting CNA Incentive 



122 

 

b. Comparative statement of DBM approved level of operating 
expenses and actual operating expenses 

c. Copy of CNA 
d. Certificate issued by the Head of the Agency on the total amount of 

unencumbered savings generated from cost-cutting measures 

identified in the CNA which resulted from the joint efforts of labor 

and management and systems improvement measures identified 

e. Proof that the planned programs/activities/projects have been 
implemented and completed in accordance with targets for the 

year” 

 

10.12. Post-audit of the payment of CNA incentive amounting to ₱375,000.00 in 
December 2020 showed that the only attached document is the list of staff 

who will receive the ₱25,000.00 CNA Incentive. 

 

10.13. We recommended that Management: 
 

PNU-Visayas 

a. direct the personnel concerned to submit the required documents 
to support their claims for regular or special monetization, 

otherwise, said claims will be suspended in audit; and 

 

PNU-Mindanao 

b. require the concerned staff to coordinate with PNU-Manila and 
submit the complete documents supporting the claimed CNA 

Incentive pursuant to DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-5 dated 

November 4, 2020. 

 

10.14. The Management’s comments are as follows: 
 

Management’s Comments 

PNU-Visayas  

The Management noted the COA’s observation. It already sent a 

Memorandum to the Acting Accountant to collect the required documents and 

submit the same within the period mentioned. 

PNU-Mindanao  

The Accountant already coordinated with the appropriate offices at PNU-

Manila for the other documentary requirements to support the payment of the 

CNA Incentive.  Moreover, she has also been reminded to comply with the 

documentary requirements and ensure that proper and complete documentation 

are attached in the processing of payments. 

 

 

 

 

 



123 

 

Various disbursements not in accordance with existing rules and regulations 

 

b.1.  Overpayment of PERA 
 

10.15. Section 4.i of the Joint Resolution No. 4 of the Fourteenth Congress dated                          
June 17, 2009 and Section 1.3 of DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 2009-003 

dated August 18, 2009, state that the PERA in the maximum amount of 

₱500.00 per month and the Additional Compensation in the amount of 

₱1,500.00 shall be combined and collectively referred to as PERA in the 

amount of ₱2,000.00 per month. 

 

10.16. Furthermore, Section 9.0 of the DBM BC No. 2009-003 also states that, 
“Agency Head shall be responsible for the proper implementation of the 

provisions of this Circular. They shall be held liable for any grant of PERA 

not in accordance with the provisions of this Circular without prejudice, 

however, to the refund of any undue payments by the personnel concerned.” 

 

10.17. Management was able to make necessary adjustments on the provision of 
PERA for June 2020, however, 193 of its employees still received PERA 

more than what is allowed for two months’ worth ranging from ₱6.45 up to 

₱3,331.90, which aggregated ₱15,780.42, as summarized below:

         3,331.90  1 3,331.90 

Total 193 ₱       15,780.42 

 

10.18. We recommended that Management of PNU-Manila: 
 

a. instruct the concerned employees to refund the excess payment 
received from their PERA in the aggregate amount of ₱15,780.42 

to warrant the non-issuance of a Notice of Disallowance for paying 

beyond what is prescribed by Joint Resolution No. 4 of the 



124 

 

Fourteenth Congress dated June 17, 2009 and Budget Circular No. 

2009-003 dated August 18, 2009; and 

 

b. provide this Office with a certified copy of the OR to serve as a 
proof in the remittance of the excess payment of ₱15,780.42 to the 

National Treasury. 

 

10.19. As of February 10, 2021, the PNU-Manila Management has already notified 
concerned officials regarding excess of their PERA and the Accounting Unit 

will process the remittance to the BTr by March 2021. 

 

 

b.2. Excessive/irregular and other deficiencies in the payment of honoraria 
 

10.20. Section 5.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012defined 
excessive expenditure as: 

 

“Unreasonable expense or expenses incurred at an immoderate 

quantity and exorbitant price. It also includes expenses which exceed 

what is usual or proper, as well as expenses which are unreasonably 

high and beyond just measure or amount. They also include expenses 

in excess of reasonable limits.” 

 

i) Double payment of honoraria amounting to ₱68,500.00 
 

10.21. Audit of DVs and their supporting documents pertaining to the payment of 
honoraria to BAC and TWG honoraria revealed that the University granted 

the honoraria of the Chairs and Members amounting to ₱666,000.00 for 24 

procurements in CYs 2018-2020 which were charged from the savings of the 

projects in the STF and GF. Of the 24, there were only 13 procurements that 

involved public bidding which are as follows:

10.22. However, evaluation of honoraria pertaining to these procurements revealed 
that the BAC and TWG Chairman and Members received payment of 

honoraria twice in relation to the construction of the Two-storey Classroom 

Building Phase I (Item Nos. 1 and 2), security services (Item Nos. 3 and 4) 

and janitorial services (Item Nos. 5 and 6), as noted in the above table with 

Check Nos. 492787 and 595205 dated January 9, 2019 and January 22, 2020, 

respectively. These resulted in the double payment amounting to ₱68,500.00 

under the STF, which is disallowed in audit. 

 

ii) Honoraria amounting to ₱322,000.00 were paid for procurements undertaken 
thru Shopping and Negotiated Procurement - Small Value Procurement (SVP)  

 

10.23. Section 5.2 of DBM BC No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005 provides the 
following: 

“The payment of honoraria shall be limited to procurement that 

involves competitive bidding. Competitive bidding activities are 

present only in: 

 Open and competitive bidding; 

 Limited source bidding; 

 Negotiated procurement under Section 53 (a) of the IRR-A, where 
there has been failure of bidding for the second time; and  

 Negotiated procurement under 53 (b) of the IRR-A following the 
procedures under Section 54.2 (b) thereof, whereby the procuring 

entity shall draw up a list of at least three (3) suppliers or 

contractors which will be invited to submit bid. 

 

Conversely, honoraria will not be paid when procurement is thru: 

 Direct contracting; 



126 

 

 Repeat Order; 

 Shopping; 

 Negotiated procurement under Section 53 (b) of the IRR-A 
following the procedures under Section 54.2 (d) thereof, whereby 

the procuring entity directly negotiates with the previous supplier, 

contractor or consultant; or when the project is undertaken by 

administration or thru the AFP, in case of infrastructure projects; 

and  

 Negotiated procurement under Section 53(c) to (g) of the IRR-A.” 
 

10.24. Moreover, the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) in its Non-
Policy Matter (NPM) Opinion No. 0529-2013 dated June 26, 2013 presents 

clarification on the granting of honoraria on the basis of successfully 

completed procurement projects using Negotiated Procurement under Section 

53.9 (Small Value Procurement) of the revised IRR of RA No. 9184. It 

presented therein that: 

 

“Section 5.2 of the DBM Circular No. 2004-5A (Circular) provides 

that the payment of honoraria shall be limited to procurement that 

involves competitive bidding, which is present only in Competitive 

Bidding (Section 10), Limited Source Bidding (Section 49), and 

Negotiated Procurement under Two-Failed Biddings (Section 53.1). 

Conversely, honoraria will not be paid when procurement is through 

all the other alternative modes of procurement provided in RA 9184 

and its IRR where competitive bidding or a semblance thereof is 

considered not present. Hence, honoraria should not be given when 

the procurement method used is Negotiated Procurement (Small Value 

Procurement).” 

 

10.25. It further explains that: 
 

“In distinguishing among the methods of procurement where 

honoraria may be provided, the Circular considered only those 

modalities where there is seeming competition. From the alternative 

methods of procurement under RA 9184 and its IRR, Limited Source 

Bidding and Negotiated Procurement under Two-Failed Biddings are 

considered to employ competitive processes. Thus, the Circular 

considered the rest of the alternative modalities of procurement as 

methods not involving competitive selection, and thus, entitlement to 

honoraria is not applicable.” 

 

10.26. The remaining 11 completed projects from CYs 2018-2020 were awarded 
through Negotiated Procurement (Small Value Procurement) and Shopping 

based on the issued BAC Resolution of the University with details below. 

Based on our audit, the Chairs and Members of the BAC and TWG were 



127 

 

granted honoraria amounting to ₱322,000.00 out of the STF on the 

aforementioned projects.

10.27. We recommended that Management direct the Chairs and Members of 
the BAC and TWG to refund to the STF the disallowed amount of 

₱68,500.00 pertaining to the double payment of honoraria as well as the 

unauthorized payment  of honoraria of ₱322,000.00 on the procurement 

conducted thru Negotiated Procurement (Small Value Procurement) and 

Shopping which are considered excessive and irregular expenditures, 

respectively, pursuant to COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 

2012 and DBM BC No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005.  

 

10.28. The BAC Chair explained that regardless of the mode of procurement, the 
BAC and TWG should be entitled to honoraria due to the nature and scope of 

work accomplished per project. Likewise, the PNU-North Luzon 

Management explained that the honoraria for small value procurement and 



128 

 

shopping were for the work done by the Chairs and Members of BAC and 

TWG. In addition, the procurement for CY 2020 was considered urgent and 

emergency cases. As to the double payment, the BAC Chairman agreed that 

the honoraria from classroom building phase I was indeed paid twice. 

However, the honoraria from security and janitorial services were not 

considered double payment because the aforementioned procurement for the 

said services was different. The BAC will submit documents to support this 

claim. 

 

10.29. For the Auditor’s Rejoinder, the Audit Team still finds the granting of 
honoraria for Small Value Procurement and Shopping as irregular. The DBM 

is clear on the conditions for which honoraria can be granted to BAC and 

TWG Chairs and Members. As to the contention that the procurement is of 

urgent and emergency nature, there is no specific provision cited in the BAC 

Resolution as to the mode of procurement that the procurement is considered 

emergency and urgent. Lastly, we require the BAC to submit the documents 

for janitorial and security services. 

 

iii) Overpayment of honoraria in PNU-Visayas for teaching overload of faculty 
members in the undergraduate program  

 

10.30. Section 7.13.1 (Honoraria for Teaching Overload), Chapter 7 of the DBM 
Manual on Position Classification and Compensation (DBM MPCC), 

provides that: 

 

“Faculty members are entitled to honoraria for services rendered in 

excess of the regular teaching load. Honoraria shall be based on the 

Prime Hourly Teaching Rate (PHTR) which shall be computed as 

follows: 

 

7.13.1.1 For undergraduate program 

 

 

 

 

 

 Where: 

AR = annual salary rate of each faculty proposed to be paid honoraria 

W = Total teaching hours (40hrs/week multiplied by 40 weeks or 1600 hrs.)  

T = 1.25 or 125% of the faculty’s remuneration for services in excess 

of 6 hours of actual teaching per day but not more than 2 hours” 

 

10.31. Our audit of disbursements in CY 2020 disclosed that PNU-Visayas paid a 
total of ₱4,333,183.51 to 42 faculty members in the undergraduate programs 

as honorarium for services rendered in excess of the regular teaching load. 

Details are as follows:

10.32. Under Section 7.13.1 (Honoraria for Teaching Overload), Chapter 7 of the 
Manual on Position Classification and Compensation of DBM, the PHTR is 

computed based on the total teaching hours, which is 40 hours/week 

multiplied by 40 weeks. 

 

10.33. Conversely, confirmation from the Management revealed that their 
computation of honorarium was based on BOR Resolution No. U-2409, 

series of 2015, resulting in a higher PHTR from .000781 to .001.  

 

10.34. The aforementioned rate is contrary to Section 7.13.1, Chapter 7 of the 
Manual on Position Classification and Compensation of DBM. Improper use 

of PHTR in the computation of honoraria for services rendered in excess of 

the regular teaching load resulted in overpayment of ₱952,065.50.00. 

 

10.35. It must be emphasized that Section 7(a) of RA No. 7168 provides that the 
Board shall have the power “to enact rules and regulations not contrary to 

law as may be necessary to carry out the purpose and functions of the 

University.” The power of the PNU Board to enact rules and regulations is 

with limitation – which must not be contrary to law and it must be in line 

with the purpose of the University. Any rules(s)/regulation(s)/resolution(s) 

issued by the Board of PNU must not be contrary to other pertinent laws in 

order to be valid. 

 

10.36. Meanwhile, Section 7(h) of RA No. 7168 which provides that the Board is 
given the power to “fix and adjust salaries of faculty members and 

administrative officials and employees” is not without limit. The power of 

the Board must observe/consider RA Nos. 6758 and 8292. If the said laws 

were not being considered/followed, then, any resolution(s) issued is/are not 

valid. This is line with Section 7(a) of RA No. 7168 that it must not be 

contrary to law. 
 



130 

 

10.37. The power of the Board to grant additional allowance and compensation to 
its officials and employees, in whatever form or terminology, should be 

subordinate at all times to the pertinent law on the matter. 

 

10.38. In COA Decision No. 2019-156 dated May 23, 2019, the Commission Proper 
recognizes that payment of extra-load pay in excess of the rate provided by 

the DBM must be disallowed. The CP ruled: 

 

“In this case, the payment of ELP (extra-load pay) was computed 

based on PLM Resolution No. 1761 imposing rates in excess of the 

formula prescribed in the DBM MPCC. Hence, the excess ELP must 

perforce be disallowed. The practice for the past 17 years of using the 

rates under PLM Resolution No. 1761 cannot ripen into a policy, the 

same being contrary to rules and regulations.” 

 

10.39. As early as CY 2018, we have already informed the Management that they 
cannot depart from the PHTR provided by DBM MPCC, but despite of 

which, the Management continuously adapted a higher rate.  Based on the 

foregoing, the excess overload payment of ₱952,065.50 in CY 2020 is 

contrary to existing rules and regulations and must necessarily be disallowed. 

 

10.40. We recommended that Management strictly adhere to Section 7.13.1 of 
Chapter 7 of the Manual on Position Classification and Compensation of 

DBM in the computation of honoraria for teaching overload paid to 

faculty members of the University. Further, payments in excess of the 

allowable rate will be disallowed in audit. 

 

10.41. The Management noted the COA’s observation. It already issued a 
Memorandum to the HR to follow the rates prescribed by DBM in the 

computation of honoraria for teaching overload. 

 

 

b.3. Erroneous computation of claims for monetization of leave credits of personnel 
in PNU-North Luzon 

 

10.42. Payments for the monetization of leave credits in PNU-North Luzon of 18 
officials and employees were erroneously computed which resulted in the 

underpayment of ₱48,764.91. 
 

10.43. Section 3.1 of DBM BC No. 2016-2 dated March 29, 2016 provides the 
computation of monetization of leave credits, as follows: 

 

Pursuant to Section 40 of CSC MC No. 14, Terminal Leave Benefits 

(TLB) and Monetization of Leave Credits (MLC) shall be computed as 

follows: 

 



131 

 

TLB=SxDxCF 

 

Where: 

TLB = Terminal Leave Benefits 

S = Highest Monthly Salary Received 

D = No. of accumulated vacation and sick leave credits 

CF = Constant factor which is 0.0481927 

 

10.44. The constant factor was derived from this formula: 
 

Number of months in a year 

No. of days in a year less than the sum of Saturdays and Sundays 

and Legal Holidays in a year 

 

365 = Days in a year 

104 = Weekends in a year 

12 = Legal Holidays in a year (in accordance with RA 

9849, which includes Eidul Adha and Eidul Fitr) 

12 = Months in a year 

 

12 
= 

12 
= 0.0481927 

365-(104-12) 149 

 

Based on the above formula, the equivalent number of days in a month for 

purposes of computation of TLB is 20.75. 

 

10.45. Moreover, Section 3, Chapter 18 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides 
that: 

 

“A provision shall be recognized when:  

 

a. An entity has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a 
result of a past event;  

b. It is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits or service potential will be required to settle the 

obligation; and  

c. A reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  
 

If these conditions are not met, no provision shall be recognized.  

 

In some cases, it is not clear whether there is a present obligation. In 

these cases, a past event is deemed to give rise to a present obligation 

if, taking account of all available evidence, it is more likely than not 

that a present obligation exists at the reporting date. (Par. 23, IPSAS 

19) 

 



132 

 

An entity shall not recognize a contingent liability. However, it is 

disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying 

economic benefits or service potential is remote. Likewise, an entity 

shall not recognize a contingent asset since this may result in the 

recognition of revenue that may never be realized. A contingent asset 

is disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits or service potential 

is probable.” (Pars. 35, 36, 39, 41, 42, IPSAS 19) 

 

10.46. Audit of DVs and their supporting documents with details below revealed 
that University official and employees were paid monetization of leave 

credits which were duly approved by the Executive Director and Provost. 

 
Table 48: Disbursements of PNU-North Luzon on Monetization of Leave Credits 

Date Check No. Particulars Amount 

(In Pesos) 

12/15/2020 565918 Monetization of leave for CY 2020 751,606.51 

12/18/2020 565934 Monetization of leave for CY 2020 35,933.86 

Total 787,540.37 

 

10.47. Verification on the basis of computation disclosed that the Accountant did 
not use the prescribed factor per DBM BC, instead, he computed the 

corresponding amount of monetization using the following formula: 

 

MLC = Monthly Salary x No. of Days Monetized 

22 

 

10.48. The erroneous computation of monetization resulted in the underpayment of 
₱48,764.91 due to 18 officers and employees and the understatement of the 

related expense and liability accounts.  Such amount should be paid to them 

subject to the availability of Personnel Services savings for CY 2020.  

 

10.49. We recommended and Management agreed to advise the Accountant to 
prepare the DVs for the underpayment of monetization of leave credits 

amounting to ₱48,764.91 subject to the availability of funds pursuant to 

Section 3.1 of DBM BC No. 2016-2 dated March 29, 2016. Likewise, 

adjusting entry should be set up in the University’s books recognizing 

the incurrence of additional monetization expenditure by debiting the 

Other Personnel Benefits account and crediting the Leave Benefits 

Payable account for ₱48,764.91. 

 

 

b.4. Usage of MOOE budget for Capital Outlay 
 

10.50. The allotment for repairs and maintenance were utilized for infrastructure 
projects and the procurement of equipment with a total contract price of 

₱3,579,151.93, which are considered Capital Outlay, contrary to Section 37 



133 

 

of PD No. 1177, making the disbursement irregular and also affecting the fair 

presentation of accounts in the financial statements. 

 

10.51. Section 37 of PD No. 1177 and a similar provision in Section 32, Book VI, 
Chapter 6 of EO No. 292 provide that “All moneys appropriated for 

functions, activities, projects and programs shall be available solely for the 

specific purposes for which these are appropriated.”  

 

10.52. The following infrastructure projects and procurement of equipment were 
implemented by PNU-Visayas:

10.53. Examination of the DVs for the payments made in CY 2020 as to the 
accounting entries used and the charges to the allotment as evidenced by the 

Obligation Request and Status (ORS) showed that the payment were charged 

to repairs and maintenance.  

 

10.54. Evaluation of the attached documents and inquiry from the Inspection 
Officer, as well as the Property Officer of the Agency as to the extent of the 

works under these infrastructure projects disclosed the following:

Improvement of PNUV Dormitory  Attached documents show construction of

Enhancement of Medical/Dental Clinic Improvement of an existing building 

 

10.55. The above projects cannot be treated simply as minor repairs which can be 
expensed outright. Instead, these could have been properly considered as 

betterments and additions which require Capital Outlay funding.  



134 

 

10.56. Sections 25 and 26, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, discussed: 
 

“Sec. 25. Betterments. Betterments are enhancements to the future 

economic benefits or service potential of a capital asset, such as: 

 

a. an increase in the previously assessed physical output or 
service capacity; 

b. a reduction in associated operating costs; 
c. an extension of the estimated useful life; or 
d. an improvement in the quality of output. 

 

Betterments which meet the threshold of the applicable capital asset 

category are capitalized. Otherwise, they are expensed. Where 

betterment enhances the future economic benefits or service potential 

of a capital asset without increasing its estimated useful life, the 

depreciation period shall remain the same. Where betterment 

increases the estimated useful life of a capital asset, its useful life shall 

be changed. The revised depreciation period shall not exceed the 

estimated useful life of that capital asset. Where betterment involves 

the replacement of an identifiable component of a capital asset, the 

original cost of that component and the related accumulated 

depreciation shall be derecognized. 

 

xxx 

 

Sec. 26. Additions and Rearrangements. Additions are modifications 

which increase the physical size or function of the PPE. Two types of 

expenditures which shall be both capitalized are namely, entirely new 

unit and expansion, and enlargement or extension of the old asset. xxx 

On the other hand, rearrangements are cost incurred in moving an 

asset from one location to another that will benefit future periods but 

do not represent additions, replacements or improvements.  

 

The cost of an addition which is a new unit is depreciated over its 

useful life. But the cost of an expansion shall be depreciated over its 

useful life or remaining life of the PPE of which it is part, whichever is 

shorter.” 

 

10.57. As to the Dry Standpipe System, the same could be properly considered as a 
Disaster Response and Rescue Equipment (Firefighting Equipment and 

Accessories) and not a repair and maintenance expense. 

 

10.58. Section 87 of PD No. 1177, on Misuse of Government Funds and Property, 
provides that “Any public official or employee who shall apply any 

government fund or property under his administration or control to any use 



135 

 

other than that for which such fund or property is appropriated by law, shall 

suffer the penalty imposed under the appropriate penal laws.” 

 

10.59. Note further, that the use of public funds for public purposes other than that 
for which such funds were appropriated by law is punishable under the 

Revised Penal Code for illegal use of public funds. Article 220 of the 

Revised Penal Code reads: 

 

“Art. 220. Illegal use of public funds or property. -  Any public officer who 

shall apply any public fund or property under his administration to any 

public use other than that for which such fund or property were appropriated 

by law or ordinance shall suffer the penalty of prision correccional in its 

minimum period or a fine ranging from one-half to the total of the sum 

misapplied, if by reason of such misapplication, any damage or 

embarrassment shall have resulted to the public service. In either case, the 

offender shall also suffer the penalty of temporary special disqualification.” 

 

10.60. Moreover, since the cost for these projects were not capitalized, it in effect 
understated the PPE account and overstated the expense account. 

 

10.61. The foregoing observations show disregard by the Accounting personnel and 
other concerned officials of the different campuses of the PNU, of existing 

relevant government laws, rules and regulations on government expenditures, 

and prudence was not exercised in the disbursement of government funds, 

thus casting doubts on the propriety and validity of the abovementioned 

expenditures. 

 

10.62. We recommended that Management of PNU-Visayas see to it that: 
 

a. certain project is appropriately funded before implementing the 
same and that funds allotted for specific programs/projects shall 

be used solely for that purpose in accordance with PD No. 1177 to 

avoid any civil, administrative or criminal liabilities; 

 

b. Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) allotments 
for repair and maintenance should not be used for betterments, 

and additions described under Sections 25 and 26, Chapter 10 of 

the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, or Procurement of PPE, which are 

capital expenditures by nature and thus must be funded by 

Capital Outlay allocations; 

 

c. programs/projects/activities they intend to implement for the 
succeeding years be planned judiciously and meticulously so that 

appropriate allotments/budgets may be provided thereto; and  

 



136 

 

d. adjusting entries should be prepared by the acting Accountant to 
capitalize the aforementioned projects. 

 

10.63. The Management noted the COA’s observation. It already sent a letter to 
PNU-Manila seeking an advice about the AOM observation. Nevertheless, 

the Management will consider the recommendation provided. 

 

 

Low Utilization of Special Trust Fund (STF) of PNU-Manila 

 

11. Audit of PNU-Manila STF budget disclosed the following: a) unutilized budget 
of ₱37,277,929.32 or equivalent to 53.39 percent of its ₱69,825,622.01 CY 2020 

approved STF budget; b) minimal budget allotted for the repairs/rehabilitation 

of the school buildings, thus was not responsive to the needs of the students for 

improved facilities; c) non-utilization of the allocated research fund and 

extension projects in combined amount of  ₱2,499,000.00, indicating a setback 

in the delivery of research and extension services; and d) minimal utilization of 

only ₱4,397,978.02 or 27.29 percent of budget allocation for Fiduciary Fund of 

₱16,113,077.58,  thereby,  defeating the intended purposes for the collection 

thereof. 

 

11.1. Paragraph 4, Section 4 (d) of RA No. 8292 or the Higher Education 
Modernization Act of 1997 provides, in part, that “any income generated by 

the university or college from tuition fees and other charges, as well as from 

the operation of auxiliary services and land grants, shall be retained by the 

university or college, and may be disbursed by the Board of Regents/Trustees 

(BOR/T) for instruction, research, extension, or other programs/projects of 

the university or college: Provided, that all fiduciary fees shall be disbursed 

for the specific purposes for which they are collected.” 

 

11.2.  CMO No. 20, series of 2011 established and institutionalized uniform fiscal 
policies that served as guidelines in the usage and disposition of all internally 

generated funds accruing to the State University/College (SUC). It also 

integrated a system of accountability for all fund administrators. Hence, 

Sections 6 to 17 thereof had set the specific budget allocations for and the 

corresponding limitations on the adjustment or modification of percentage 

allocation on the thrusts, programs, and activities for Tuition Fees, as 

follows:

11.5. For CY 2020, the PNU-Manila Campus made a low/minimal utilization of 
20.24 percent or ₱2,529,147.62 out of the approved budget of 

₱12,495,000.00 from the Tuition Fees Allocation. This can be attributed to 

the COVID-19 Pandemic, wherein implementations of various projects were 

curtailed due to the suspension of work and classes before the end of the 1st 

Quarter. However, some activities can still be implemented while the locality 

is undertaking the community quarantine measures as semblance of normalcy 

returned little by little starting the month of June. 

 

11.6. Under the area of Facilities Development, the utilization in the amount of 
₱1,861,389.12 is already accounted at 99.31 percent of its total allocation of 

₱1,874,250.00. However, other facilities are still badly in need for repairs, 

maintenance and improvements specially the Geronimo Building, which is 

one of the oldest structures of the University. Whenever torrential rain 

occurs, the roof leaks and the water cascades down from the 3rd floor to the 

2nd Floor area which causes flood on the hallways compromising the safety of 

the students and employees. It also necessitates the proper maintenance to 

fortify its structure and prolong its useful life as well as enhance its over-all 

look being an iconic structure of the University. 

 

11.7. Modification of the allocated percentages apportioned to the components of 
instruction should have been resorted to, in order to give emphasis on matters 

that should be addressed at once like the repairs and rehabilitation of the 

Geronimo Building, subject to the limitations as provided in Section 7 of 

CMO No. 20 series 2011.  

 

11.8. Meanwhile, the funds allocated in the amount of ₱2,499,000.00 for the 
research and extension services, which are two of the major trifocal functions 

of the SUCs were not utilized at all. The PNU was not able to accomplish 

and pursue its research activities and conduct technology transfer of research 

outputs that would help uplift the lives of the people living in the community 

where it is located.  

 

11.9. Moreover, Fiduciary Fund also has a low/minimal utilization rate of 27.29 
percent or only ₱4,397,978.02 out of its approved budget of ₱16,113,077.58 

which should have been disbursed for their intended purposes. Hence, the 

72.71 percent unutilized fund or ₱11,715,099.56 could have been used to 

improve the operations, facilities and equipment of gym, laboratories, library 

and clinic. While it is true that SUCs are authorized to collect fiduciary fees 

from students every semester, we believe that these should be utilized as 



141 

 

intended in order to address the needs of the students for improved facilities 

once they return to normal/regular class set-up.  

 

11.10. Though unutilized fund will be carried-forward and reprogrammed to the 
next budget year, Management should always take the opportunity to 

maximize the use of said funds to ensure that the benefits intended for the 

students and employees are provided for accordingly in a timely manner, thus 

unutilized balances hinder the effective delivery of services to its 

stakeholders. Similarly, the non/minimal utilization of the BOR-approved 

STF budget is inconsistent with Section 24 of CMO No. 20, series of 2011, 

that the budget authorized shall be implemented within the CY for which it 

was formulated resulting in accumulation of unutilized balances maintained 

in the Authorized Government Depository Banks (AGDB).  

 

11.11. We recommended that Management:  
 

a. observe set timelines in the implementation and completion of 
plans/programs and activities to ensure effective delivery of 

services, as required under Section 24 of the CMO No. 20, series of 

2011;  

 

b. prioritize the needs and safety of the students by allocating 
resources to the rehabilitation of school buildings and other 

facilities to enhance effective delivery of services; and 

 

c. maximize utilization of the STF to ensure accomplishment of the 
University’s major functions not only on instruction but also on 

research and extension services. 

  

11.12. Management will adhere to the recommendations of the Audit Team and 
assured on the effective delivery of services to be cascaded to the different 

Units of the University. It is important to note, though, that the Pandemic 

adversely affected the University, including its utilization of funds due to the 

delayed implementation of the corresponding programs/activities/projects as 

guided by CMO No. 20, series of 2011. Furthermore, the University’s budget 

for CY 2021 was already approved with the appropriate consideration on the 

corresponding trust liabilities and the budget for the rehabilitation of school 

buildings and other facilities will be embedded therein. 

 

 

Delayed implementation and low utilization of funds for Research Projects of PNU-

Mindanao 

 

12. The delayed implementation of PNU-Mindanao of the CHED-funded 
SALIKHA and Institutional Development and Innovation Grants (IDIG) 

research projectsin CY 2018 resulted in the low fund utilization rate of 19.52 



142 

 

percent and 17.15 percent, respectively, after the end of its extension on 

December 31, 2020, with a total unutilized balance of ₱9,404,559.41. 
 

12.1. Item D of the Memorandum of Agreement between CHED, NCAA and PNU 
Mindanao as the grantee of the SALIKHA grants for creation projects 

entitled “Mga Tingog Gikan sa Kamingawan: Preserving and Developing 

Cultures and Languages Through the Literatures of Mindanao” states the 

responsibilities of the grantee which requires that PNU-Mindanao, among 

others, shall: 

 

“1.  xxx 

  2. Properly utilize the funds provided by the CHED and shall see to it 

that these are used for the purpose for which the same are 

intended, in accordance with the approved Work and Financial 

Plan, and subject to usual accounting and auditing rules and 

regulations.” 

 

12.2. The CHED downloaded funds for the implementation of the project in 
August 2018 amounting to ₱2,654,034.00 and the project was approved for 

aduration of 24 months. 

 

12.3. Also, PNU-Mindanao’s project entitled: Strengthening PNU Mindanao as 
Multicultural Education Hub for the CHED’s IDIG was approved with a 24-

month duration and initial funding was received in October 2018 amounting 

to ₱8,773,520.00. 

 

12.4. Verification showed the low utilization of funds totaling ₱518,029.73 and 
₱1,504,964.86 for the SALIKHA and IDIG, respectively, as of yearend, 

summarized as follows:

12.5. Inquiry with the Project Leaders (PLs) disclosed that the implementations of 
both research projects were extended until December 31, 2020.  However, 

due to the Pandemic wherein travel restrictions were imposed, the 

procurement of needed equipment, trainings and travels to different places 

were postponed thereby affecting the implementation of the projects and the 

utilization of funds.  The PLs further informed that they were already 

requesting the CHED Central Office for another extension of both research 

projects. 

 



143 

 

12.6. Based on the foregoing, the delay in the implementation of the research 
projects resulted in the low utilization of project funds and the same were not 

utilized as planned. 

 

12.7. We recommended that Management, thru the PLs of both research 
projects, request for an extension of the implementation of the 

programs, otherwise, refund to the Source Agencies the unexpended 

balances. 
 

12.8. The Management commented that while waiting for the approval of the 
second extension of the project, the Team Members are also preparing to 

conduct and are planning to expedite the completion of the pending activities.  

The Team would like to finish the whole project as planned by coping up 

with the targets which were hampered. 

 

 

Non-compliance with the IRR of RA No. 9184 and Other Issuances on Government 

Procurement 

 

13. Various procedural lapses as well as inadequacy of supporting documents were 
noted in the procurement of goods and services, infrastructure related projects 

totaling ₱4,783,641.25 in three PNU Campuses, contrary to the provisions of 

RA No. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act, COA and other 

related procurement rules and regulations, casting doubt on the integrity and 

reliability of the procurement processes and defeating the purpose of the law on 

transparency, competitiveness and accountability. 

 

13.1. The revised IRRs were promulgated pursuant to Section 75 of RA No. 9184, 
otherwise known as the “Government Procurement Reform Act,” for the 

purpose of prescribing the necessary rules and regulations for the 

modernization, standardization and regulation of the procurement activities 

of the Government of the Philippines (GOP). 
 

13.2. Review and evaluation of the procurement process implemented by three 
PNU campuses revealed the following gaps and lapses covering procurement 

transactions amounting to ₱11,164,063.37:

By including such technical specification, the 

Procuring Entity had no other option but to 

procure from a particular brand of computer, 

which in this case was Apple, and this 

defeated the very essence and purpose of 

competitive bidding. 

 

Also, the Audit Team noted that the

₱228,000 or ₱76,000 each may be 

considered unnecessary. Upon inquiry with 

the Procurement Team, the end user did not 

state any justification why he/she preferred 

an Apple MacBook Laptop. It is worthy to 

note that there are other brands (ex. Lenovo,

Contract for the construction of classroom 

building beyond the BOR approved budget of 

₱1,500,000.00 

 

On July 21, 2020, The University 

Accountant issued a certification on the 

availability of funds for the construction of 

two-storey classroom building phase I 

amounting to ₱2,000,000.00 chargeable to 

the Special Trust Fund. Said amount was 

also considered as the Approved Budget for 

the Contract (ABC) by the Bids and Awards 

Committee in all its procurement documents. 

 

However, the BOR approved the STF 

Budget for CY 2020 as per Resolution No. 

U-3113, series of 2020 on May 29, 2020. It 

was disclosed therein that the approved 

budget for the continuation of the two-storey 

building amounted to ₱1,500,000.00, which 

is lower than the certified available funds of 

the Accountant. 

 

Based on the procurement process conducted 

by the BAC, the Lowest Calculated

March 26, 2020. Following the above 

provisions of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA

release only after the expiration of the one-

on June 15, 2020 or merely 81 days from its 

100% completion on March 26, 2020. 

Verification of the supporting documents 

also showed that the documents required 

under COA Circular were not attached to the 

disbursement voucher. The absence of said 

documents would imply that the release of 

the retention money was not substituted by 

any of the allowable form of security (i.e., 

irrevocable standby letters of credit, bank 

guarantees and/or surety bonds).

Review of the available supporting

evidenced by OR No.568300 dated 

December 27, 2019, instead of P₱187,750.00 

equivalent to 10% of the contract price, 

considering that this is an infrastructure

We further noted that the said performance 

security was released to the contractor on 

June 3, 2020 as evidenced by Check No.

Management even issued a certificate of

 Non-enforcement of warranty security

project 

 

Review of the available documents attached 

to the payments made for the project “Repair 

and Improvement of Evacuation Center 

(Drilon Covered Court) showed that there 

was no document evidencing the posting of 

warranty security by the contractor for this 

project. The previous BAC Chairman who 

implemented this project is also unsure 

whether they were able to secure a warranty 

security from the contractor.  

 

The warranty security that should have been 

required for this project shall be effective 

from March 26, 2021 to March 26, 2022.  

 

Failure to require from the contractor a 

warranty security puts the government at a 

disadvantage since indemnification will not 

be guaranteed in case the contractor will not 

perform his responsibilities for structural 

defects/failures that may arise due to faults 

attributable to improper construction, use of 

inferior quality or substandard materials and 

any violation of the contract plans and

the performance security; 

 

On the non-enforcement of warranty security - 
 

i. thru the BAC and the Accountant, make representation with the

13.4. The Management’s comments are as follows: 
 

Campus Management’s Comments 

PNU-

Manila 

 

On the procurement of laptop with specifications pertaining to a particular 

brand only - 

Management stated that justification was given to the BAC dated April 12, 

2018 and the procurement of the Apple MacBook Laptop proceeded heeding 

the needs of the end user taking into account their deliverables. Worthy to 

point out the reasons herein, as quoted: 

 

- The technical demands of the project include, among others, intensive 
video editing and system programming that require specialized laptop 

computer specifications as stipulated in the Purchase Request (PR) to 

complete project deliverables. 

- Specifications available in DBM-PS do not suit the heavy computing 
load requirement of the project. In fact, the comparable specification-

requirement of the requested laptop is gaming predator laptops that 

would cost a lot compared to what was requested. 

- DBM-PS-listed specifications do not allow large file sharing using 
electromagnetic waves which was basically a good feature of the 

requested equipment. 

- The CHED-funded project required highly dependable equipment that 
will not only perform excellently, but will also ensure security of the 

voluminous data, which is national in scope. Note that the requested 

equipment provided features automatically encrypting its SSD (solid 

state drive). 

- Finally, the requested laptop specifications, as per PR, ensured excellent 
integration of hardware and software that would allow smooth multi-

tasking, basically a required feature in components 2-4 of the project, 

which was simultaneously implemented. 
 

On the unrefunded Guaranty / Security Deposits - 

The PNU-Manila Management commented that there is a need to withhold 

the amount in case there will be defects on the items/products delivered. As 

per RA No. 9184, releasing of the amount withheld will take three months for 

expendable supplies and one year for non-expendable supplies. Along with 

the waiting period, the supplier eventually forgot their collectibles and did 

not request for the refund of guarantee deposits. The request for refund 

caused the Accounting Unit to process the refund. Furthermore, the 

Accounting Unit already coordinated with the Supply and Property Unit in 

informing the supplier(s) regarding their outstanding guarantee deposits with 

PNU.

Campus Management’s Comments 

PNU-North 

Luzon 

 

On the contract amount for the construction of classroom building beyond 

the BOR approved budget of ₱1,500,000.00 - 

Management explained that the Revised STF Budget with the budget for the 

Two-Storey Classroom Building Phase II was already forwarded for approval 

to ensure the continuity of the project and the immediate delivery of the 

benefits thereof. Further, the Accountant will observe extra diligence to see to 

it that budget is duly approved by the BOR before certifying the availability 

of funds 

PNU-

Visayas 

 

On the early release of retention money - 

1. The Management noted the Commission on Audit (COA) audit 
observations. It already sent a Memorandum to the responsible person for 

the accomplishment of a written explanation as to why the retention money 

was released prior to the expiration of the one-year defects liability period. 

The written explanation will be forwarded to the COA before the end of 

April 2021. 

 

On the early release of the performance security - 

2. The Management already sent a Memorandum to the BAC to provide a 
written explanation as to why the Performance Security posted was less 

than the required amount as provided under the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 

No. 9184. Furthermore, the Management is already drafting a written 

explanation as to why the certificate of final acceptance was issued prior to 

the expiration of the one-year defects liability period which facilitated the 

early release of the performance security. The written explanations will be 

forwarded to the COA before the end of April 2021. 

 

On the non-enforcement of warranty security - 

3. The Management will strictly enforce the posting of the warranty security 
by the contractors after the issuance of the certificate of final acceptance. 

In addition, the Management thru the BAC and Accountant will make a 

representation to the concerned contractor to post the warranty security. 

 

On the non-requirement of the Omnibus Sworn Statement -  

4. The Management will strictly follow the recommendations provided and 
require the BAC to include in the requirements for bidders and/or suppliers 

for public bidding, negotiated procurement-emergency cases under Sec 

53.2 of the Revised IRR for ABCs above ₱500,000.00 and for small-value 

procurements with ABCs above ₱50,000.00. 

 

On the non-submission of the required supporting documents for the Repair 

and Improvement of Evacuation Center (Drilon Covered Court) – 

5. The Management noted the Commission’s audit observations.  It already 
directed the responsible officer to immediately comply and submit the 

lacking necessary documents. 

 



156 

 

Campus Management’s Comments 

On the non-submission of the required supporting documents for the Repair 

and Improvement of PNU- Visayas Sports Office Court – 

6. The Management will submit the necessary lacking documents and require 
the BAC to make representation with the contractor for the posting of 

performance bond. Recommendations such as requiring the accountant to 

deduct, in all infrastructure projects, retention money for the progress 

payments, avoiding stipulation in the contracts payment terms which are 

contrary to law and submission of pictures that capture the works done 

“before, during and after construction of items of work” will be strictly 

followed 

 

 

Compliances with Gender and Development (GAD)   

 

14. The audit of the implementation of GAD Programs disclosed the following 
deficiencies: a) non-integration of at least five percent of Agency’s Budget to 

regular activities addressing gender issues; and b) out of the 16 planned 

programs of PNU-System as indicated in its GAD Plan and Budget (GPB), 

three programs were not undertaken, while 13 programs although 

implemented, were not fully in adherence with the planned activities, resulting 

in utilization of only  ₱2,222,818.85, out of the budget of ₱5,153,600.00 contrary 

to the pertinent provisions of Section 31 of RA No. 11465, otherwise known as 

the GAA for FY 2020, and the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW)-

National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)-DBM JC No. 2012-01, thus 

gender concerns and issues were not fully addressed. Moreover, the PCW-

reviewed GPB and GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) were not submitted to 

the Audit Team of PNU-South Luzon within the prescribed period under COA 

Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014.  
 

14.1. Section 31 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 provides the 
following: 

 

“All agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and 

Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within 

their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable 

provisions under R.A. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, 

Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against 

Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for 

Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine 

Development Plan (2017-2022). 

 

The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 

agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. 

For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies 

which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, 



157 

 

economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, 

promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of 

gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance 

with said requirement.  Utilization of the GAD budget shall be 

evaluated based on the GAD performance indicator identified by said 

agencies. xxx” 

 

14.2. Section 8.2 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 provides that the 
GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) shall submit the final GPB and the 

corresponding GAD AR to the PCW for review and endorsement to the 

DBM. Section 8.7 thereof requires the agency to submit their PCW-endorsed 

GPB to the DBM along with their annual GAD AR for the previous year in 

accordance with the budget call. 

 

14.3. Moreover, Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001dated March 18, 2014 
states that the Auditee Agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GPB to the 

COA Audit Team assigned to the agency within five (5) working days front 

the receipt of the approved plan from the PCW. Likewise, a copy of the 

corresponding GAD AR shall be furnished the said Audit Team within five 

working days from the end of January of the preceding year. 

 

14.4. Audit and review of the extent of compliance of the PNU University and its 
campuses with GAD related policies for CY 2020 revealed the following 

observations/deficiencies: 

 

Non-integration of at least five percent of Agency’s Budget to regular activities 

addressing gender issues 

 

14.5. This year’s audit revealed that the GPB of PNU System did not meet the 
criteria of allocating at least five percent of the total budget appropriation. 

The University allocated ₱7,281,900.00, which constituted only 1.31 percent 

of the total adjusted budgetary appropriation of ₱556,405,200.00. Of this 

amount, at least ₱27,820,260.00 should have been allocated for GAD 

programs.  

 

14.6. Moreover, the allocated GAD Budget of ₱7,281,900.00 was not fully utilized 
as the actual GAD disbursements only amounted to ₱2,222,818.85 

comprising only 30.53 percent of the allocated budget and 0.40 percent of the 

PNU’s adjusted appropriations of ₱556,405,200.00. 

 

14.7. The allocation of GAD budget below the five percent minimum requirement 
as mandated by the GAA and MCW indicates a deficiency in GAD planning 

and inefficient integration of the GAD budget with the Agency’s major 

programs thereby restricting the enhancement of gender mainstreaming 

within the Agency. 

 



158 

 

Out of the 16 planned programs reflected in the GPB, three programs were not 

undertaken, while 13 programs although implemented, were not fully adhered to as 

planned. 

 

14.8. The GAD Programs depicted in the table below were not undertaken despite 
being included in the GPB, incurring a total of ₱2,128,300.00 unspent 

balance, which contributed to the underspending of GAD Funds for            

CY 2020.

during actual implementation of the same amounted to ₱2,222,818.85 only, 

leaving an unspent balance of ₱2,930,781.15, contributing to the 

underspending of GAD Funds. The result of the implementation and 

disbursement may also imply deficient budgeting and use of GAD Funds.

14.10. In PNU-South Luzon Campus, the  PCW-endorsed GPB and its 
corresponding GAD AR were  not submitted to the Audit Team within the 

prescribed period contrary to the above-cited regulations, thus the Audit 

Team was prevented from conducting the timely review and verification of 

said reports to determine whether the expenditures incurred to address the 

gender issues identified by the Agency were in accordance with existing 

accounting and auditing rules and regulations and whether the gender issues 

were endorsed by PCW.  

 

14.11. We recommended that Management: 
 

a. submit justification for the deficiencies on the budget allocation 
and utilization of GAD budget, particularly those 

accomplishments that are different from the planned activities;

COE No. 2018-070 dated September 3, 2018 to the Management, excerpts of 

which are as follows: 

 

“Please withhold the payment of the salaries or any amount due to the 

(above-named) persons liable, for the settlement of their liabilities 

pursuant to the decisions/NDs referred to (above), copies of which are 

attached and made integral part thereof. 

 

In case any of the (above-named) persons are no longer in the service, 

please cause the collection or settlement of the same directly from 

them, and inform this office of efforts to collect within fifteen days 

from receipt of this COE. 

 

Payment of salaries or any amount due them in violation of this 

instruction will be disallowed in audit and you will be held liable for 

the disallowance. 

 

If full settlement of the above ND has been made, please disregard this 

COE and furnish this office with authenticated copy/ies of the Official 

Receipt/s or equivalent proof for the said settlement, for record and 

monitoring purposes.” 

 

19.7. Section 13 of the aforesaid Circular states that “the Notice of Settlement of 
Suspension/Disallowance/Charge (NSSDC) shall be issued by the Auditor 

whenever a suspension, disallowance or charge is settled.” While Section 24 

states that “recorded final disallowances and charges which are settled shall 

be dropped from the books of accounts upon receipt by the Accountant of the 

NSSDC.” 

 

19.8. Whereas, Sections 8 and 9 of COA Resolution No. 2017-021 dated        
November 7, 2017, state that: 

 

“Section 8. All requests for installment payment shall be submitted to and 

reviewed by the Prosecution and Litigation Office (PLO), 

Legal Service Sector (LSS), through the concerned Auditors 

and Cluster/Regional Directors, with appropriate comment, 

recommendation, proposed installment schedule, and 

supporting documents. Upon due evaluation, the PLO Director 

shall approve/grant the request for installment strictly in 

accordance with the schedule provided hereunder, which shall 

be effective immediately upon receipt thereof. Any deficient 

request shall be returned immediately to the requesting party, 

through the concerned Auditors and Cluster/Regional 

Directors. 

 



169 

 

Section 9.  Request of installment payments covering cases which are not 

covered by this Resolution shall be submitted to the 

Commission Proper for its consideration, after evaluation and 

recommendation of the PLO, LSS.” 

 

19.9. As verified, said COE was not fully enforced, as shown by the uncollected 
balance of ₱3,829,535.13 reported in the SL on the said disallowances, under 

the Receivables-Disallowance/Charges account. 

 

19.10. Furthermore, for the settlement thereof on installment, the Audit Team did 
not receive any request from the University, asking permission to settle the 

disallowances using the installment mode of payment prior to the 

University’s implementation thereof. 

 

19.11. Lastly, no authenticated copies of ORs or equivalent proof of settlement were 
provided to this Office to cause the issuance of NSSDC, which in turn shall 

be the basis of the Accounting Division to recognize the said payments in its 

books. 

 

19.12. The Management’s non-adherence to the above-cited rules and regulations 
resulted in the unauthorized instalment payment and long outstanding 

disallowance which should have been immediately refunded upon the 

issuance of COE. 

 

19.13. We recommended that PNU-Manila Management:  
 

a. cause the immediate collection/refund of the remaining balance of 
₱3,829,535.13 per COE issued on the aforementioned 

disallowances; 

 

b. submit to the Audit Team the evidence of settlements of the 
disallowances amounting to ₱3,915,464.87 for the issuance of 

NSSDC;  

 

c. inform the Audit Team, on a monthly basis, or  whenever 
settlements on disallowances and charges are being made by the 

liable persons thru submission of certified copies of ORs (when 

settled in cash); and signed JEVs with corresponding SLs (if made 

thru salary deduction), with covering letter indicating the ND No. 

and Date being settled and attaching a detailed payment summary 

schedule, showing the name of persons, corresponding manner of 

settlement, particulars (OR No. and date/JEV No.) and amount, 

among others, to facilitate COA’s issuance of NSSDC; 

 

d. request from COA-PLO, LSS the authority to settle thru 
installment basis the disallowance covered by COE; and 



170 

 

 

e. see to it that the recorded final disallowances shall only be 
dropped from the books of accounts upon receipt by the 

Accountant of the NSSDC issued by COA. 

 

19.14. Management commented that the Accounting Unit will adhere to the 
aforementioned recommendations and stated that prior to the 

implementation, the PNU Management wrote a letter dated September 30, 

2019 to Ms. Victoria R. Yumang to inform the target timeline of 

implementation. Subsequently, a letter dated November 5, 2019 was sent to 

Atty. Fortunata M. Rubico, then Director IV, LSS-PSO, COA, informing of 

the recent actions of the PNU Management, accompanied by University 

Memorandum No. 135, series of 2019. From thereon, the Management did 

not receive any comment/reply from the COA for its implementation. 

 

19.15. Moreover, as tackled in the Exit Conference, the full amount of the COE was 
scheduled for full collection by December 2020 but was extended in 

compliance with the provisions of the Bayanihan 2 Act for the deferment of 

payment for two months.
