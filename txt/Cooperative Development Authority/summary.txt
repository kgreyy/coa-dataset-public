EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Cooperative Development Authority (CDA) is mandated to promote the 

viability and growth of cooperatives as instruments of equity, social justice and 

economic development.  

 

Pursuant to Republic Act (RA) No. 6939 dated March 10, 1990, the CDA was 

created, defining its powers, functions, responsibilities, and rationalizing 

government policies of various government agencies with cooperative functions.  

Upon creation, CDA was under the supervision by the Office of the President but 

was transferred to the Department of Finance by virtue of Executive Order No. 332 

dated July 16, 2004. On year 2016, CDA was again under the supervision of the 

Office of the President by virtue of Executive Order No.1, s.2016 dated June 30, 

2016.  

 

A Board of Administrators, consisting of the Chairman and six members, 

governs the CDA.  All are presidential appointees to serve for a term of six years 

without reappointment and are chosen from among the nominees of the cooperative 

sector with two representatives each from Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.  
 

The Executive Director, who is the Chief Operating Officer, is assisted by a 

Deputy Executive Director.  As of December 31, 2020, the CDA has 773 total 

personnel complement composed of 722 permanent, 1 casual and 50 Job Order (JO) 

employees distributed in its Central Office and 15 Extension Offices (EOs) located

The audit covered the accounts and operations of the CO and 15 EOs of CDA 

for CY 2020. The audit was conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that 

may be placed on the Management’s assertion on the financial statements; b) 

determine the propriety of transactions as well as extent of compliance on the 

applicable laws, rules and regulations; c) recommend agency improvement 

opportunities; and d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit

E. Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the faithful presentation of the 

financial statements of CDA as at December 31, 2020 due to: 

 

a) Overstatement of Loans Receivables – Others totaling ₱8,665,693.29, Due 
from NGOs/POs totaling ₱15,800,071.10, and Other Receivables accounts 

totaling ₱4,966,324.86 and overstatement of Accumulated Surplus accounts 

amounting to ₱29,432,089.25 due to unrecognized Allowance for Impairment 

as the receivables accounts remained dormant for more than 10 years with 

remote collectability/settlement, lack of documents and closed cooperatives.  

 

b) Understatement of Receivables – Disallowances/Charges and Accumulated 
Surplus accounts by ₱8,264,684.64 due to unrecorded audit disallowances with 

issued Notice of Final Decision (NFD) and the existence of negative amounts 

totaling ₱2,113,094.62. 

 

c) Understatement of Intangible Asset and Accumulated Surplus accounts by 
₱900,000.00 due to the recognition of Maintenance of the Cooperative 

Business Matching Information System (CBMIS) Project as outright expense. 

 

d) Existence of negative balances of Accounts Payables of ₱617,840.19 and Due 
to Officers and Employees account of ₱977,213.55. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the significant audit observations and corresponding 

recommendations that were discussed with Management officials concerned, details 

of which were further discussed in Part II of this report. Management views and 

comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

 

1. The Property Plant and Equipment (PPE) account balances of six EOs as of 
December 31, 2020 are unreliable due to: a) property records between Property 

and Accounting Offices not updated and reconciled; b) PPE listed in Inventory 

and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) were not dropped 

from the books; and c) incorrect computation of depreciation expense and non-

recognition of Accumulated Depreciation on transferred items; thus, not in 

accordance with the provisions stated in Chapter 10, Volume I of Government 

Accounting Manual (GAM). 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 v 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) Require the Accountant and Property/Supply Officer of CARAGA and 
Cebu EOs, that in the event that there is discrepancy between the Report 

on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) and the PPE Ledger Card 

(PPELC), they should reconcile the differences noted to have a reliable 

balance and fair presentation of the financial statements; 

 

b) Direct the Supply Officers of Pampanga and Calamba EOs to issue 

Property Sticker/Number for newly acquired/purchased PPE in order to 

identify and trace the location of the said PPE, and to issue the necessary 

Property Accountability Reports (PARs) for those issued PPE under the 

care of the end-users as required by the regulation. Copies of the PARs 

should be kept on file, maintained and provided for each recipient which 

will form part of the records as basis for their renewal every third year 

after issue; and 

 

c) Direct the Accountant of CARAGA, Cebu and MIMAROPA EOs to effect 

the necessary adjustments on accounting errors to correct the balances of 

the affected accounts in the financial statements. Henceforth, record 

transactions by properly observe the accounting guidelines prescribed in 

the GAM. 

 

2. Disbursements amounting to ₱2,801,207.38 of five EOs were not supported 
with complete documents contrary to Section 5, Chapter 2, Volume I of GAM 

and COA Circular 2012-001, thereby casting doubts on the validity and 

propriety of expenditures.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) require both the Accountant and the Cashiers of Calamba, MIMAROPA, 
Iloilo, Kidapawan and CDO EOs to exercise due diligence in the 

processing of disbursements especially in the provisions of required 

attachments/supporting documents; and 

b) direct the Accountants to submit the lacking documents for further 
evaluation and appropriate audit disposition 

 

3. Liquidated damages amounting to ₱350,317.93 were not imposed on delayed 
delivery of five units Brand New Mobile Mini Rice Mill in the implementation 

of Mindanao Peace and Normalization (MPAN) through Cooperatives 

Development Project in Pagadian City EO, not in compliance with Section 68 

of RA No. 9184 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR). 

 

 

 

 



 vi 

We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

 

a) the Accountant of Pagadian EO to scrutinize carefully the provisions 
stipulated in the contract before effecting payment and follow strictly 

Section 68 of IRR RA No. 9184; and 

  

b) the Supplier to submit justification for the delay in delivering the 
equipment, otherwise, or require them to refund for the liquidated 

damages and deposit the same to the National Treasury. 

 

4. Non-monitoring of the Marawi Rehabilitation Thru Cooperativism (MRTC) 
Project implementation by the assigned CDA personnel and non-submission of 

the monthly report on the implementation said MRTC Project resulted in 

unliquidated financial assistance totaling ₱11,314,000.00 granted to 44 

beneficiaries, for more than seven up to 31 months, contrary to Section IV, 

Items 2 and 3 of the Policy Guidelines and to the provisions of the 

Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between CDA and the cooperative 

beneficiaries. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to compel the personnel assigned 

to Kidapawan EO to monitor and submit the monthly report on the 

implementation of the MRTC Project, and directs the cooperative beneficiaries 

to liquidate the outstanding financial assistance as of December 31, 2020, in 

compliance with the provisions of the Policy Guidelines and the MOA between 

CDA and the cooperative beneficiaries. 

 

5. Twenty-nine cooperative beneficiaries of the MRTC Project were registered 
only after the Marawi Siege; hence, not compliant with the target beneficiaries 

as specified in the Approved Project Proposal, defeating the objective of the 

MRTC Project, which is the reactivation of active cooperatives that were 

displaced by the Marawi Siege. 

 

We recommended that Management identify the officials who included the 29 

ineligible cooperative beneficiaries of the MRTC Project and hold them liable 

for non-compliance with the Approved Project Proposal, as well as with the 

Policy Guidelines.  

 

 

G. Status of Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations  
 

Out of the 44 audit recommendations embodied in the CY 2019 Annual Audit 

Report, 23 were implemented and 21 were not implemented. The details are 

discussed in Part III of this Report.
