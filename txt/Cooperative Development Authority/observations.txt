OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A.  Financial Audit 

 

Dormant uncollected Loans and Other Receivables in six Extension Offices (EO) 

1. Loans Receivables – Others totaling ₱8,665,693.29, Due from NGOs/POs 
totaling ₱15,800,071.10, and Other Receivables totaling ₱4,966,324.86 in six  

EOs remained dormant for more than 10 years, and no Allowance for 

Impairment was recognized, despite the remote collectability/settlement 

thereof, due to lack of documents and already closed cooperatives, thus, 

affecting the faithful presentation of the accounts in the financial statements. 

 

COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, Guidelines and 

Procedures on the Write-off of Dormant Receivables Accounts, Unliquidated Cash 

Advances and Fund Transfers of NGAs, LGUs and GOCCs, prescribes the 

guidelines and procedures in reconciling and cleaning the books of accounts of 

NGAs, LGUs and GOCCs of dormant receivables, unliquidated cash advances and 

fund transfer for fair presentation of accounts in the financial documents. 

 

It provides that accounts/advances granted to accountable officers/agencies 

which remain inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for 10 years or more 

and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained should be 

considered dormant.  The Accountant concerned shall conduct regular and periodic 

verification, analysis and validation of the existence of these accounts/advances.  

Further, it provides that the presence of the following applicable conditions may 

render the validity and existence of the accounts doubtful; therefore, will support 

the request for write-off by the agency head concerned from the COA to wit: 

 

a. Absence of records or documents to validate/support the claim 
and/or unreconciled reciprocal accounts; 

b. Death of accountable officer/employee/debtor; 
c. Unknown whereabouts of accountable officer/employee/debtor, 

and that he/she could not be located despite diligent efforts to find 

him/her; 

d. Incapacity to pay or insolvency; 
e. Exhaustion of all possible remedies by the Management to collect 

the receivables and to demand liquidation of cash advances and 

fund transfers; or 

f. No pending case in court involving the subject of dormant 
accounts.  

 

On the other hand, Section 10, Chapter 7 of Volume I, GAM for NGAs 

requires that: 



48 

 

 

An entity shall assess at the end of each reporting period whether 

there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of 

financial assets is impaired. If any such evidence exists, the entity 

shall measure the amount of loss as the difference between the 

carrying amount of the asset and the present value of estimated 

future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original 

effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset shall be 

reduced either directly or through use of an allowance account. The 

amount of the loss shall be recognized in surplus or deficit. 

 

This is a reiteration of last year’s audit observation. 

Review of the Loans Receivables – Others and Due from NGOs/POs 

disclosed the following:

   Total 8,665,693.29 15,800,071.10  4,966,324.86  

 

Borrowers-cooperative failed to fully settle their obligations, through payment 

or liquidation, due to reasons as either the cooperatives’ registrations were cancelled 

or these were dissolved due to: a) their cancelled registrations; and b) dissolution 

brought by insolvency; further, their location can no longer be found: which made it 

impossible for the agency to recover long – outstanding receivables; thus, write off 

and set up of allowance for impairment are recommended. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Regional 

Accountants of Manila, Calamba, Pampanga, Naga, Iloilo, and CARAGA EOs 

to: 

 

a) Submit to COA a request for write-off together with all the necessary 

requirements to support the requests on Loans Receivables – Others and 

Due from NGOs/POs accounts in accordance with COA Circular No. 

2016-005 dated December 19, 2016; and 

 

b) Provide Allowance for Impairment on loans and fund transfer granted to 

cooperatives-beneficiaries which were already considered to be 



49 

 

inoperative and/or dissolved, and collection of which is remote and 

doubtful. 

 

 

Unreliable/Unsettled   Receivables – Disallowances/Charges account of CDA Central 

Office 
 

2. The balance of the Receivables – Disallowances/Charges totaling ₱1,683,334.86 

as at December 31, 2020 of CDA Central Office is understated by 

₱8,264,684.64 and unreliable, due to the unrecorded audit disallowances with 

issued NFD and the existence of negative amounts, hence, not in accordance 

with Section 46, Chapter 6, Volume I of GAM for NGAs.  Further, audit 

disallowances in CDA Central Office, and Manila, Naga, and Iloilo EOs 

totaling ₱28,881,583.73 remained unsettled as of December 31, 2020, contrary 

to Section 7.1.1 of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of 

Accounts (RRSA) prescribed under COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated 

September 15, 2009. 

 

Section 46, Chapter 6, Volume I of GAM for NGAs states that disallowances 

shall be taken up in the books of accounts only when they become final and 

executory. The Accountant shall prepare the Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to take 

up the Receivable-Disallowances/Charges and credit the appropriate account for the 

current year or Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account if pertaining to expenses of 

previous years. Cash settlement of disallowances shall be acknowledged through 

the issue of an official receipt and reported by the Cashier in the Report of 

collections and deposits. 

 

Likewise, COA Circular 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 prescribing the 

use of RRSA provides that an NFD shall be issued to inform the agency head that a 

decision of COA or its authorized representatives has become final and executory, 

which shall be the basis for recording the disallowance/charge in the agency’s 

books of accounts. 

 

The Receivables – Disallowances/Charges on the financial statements as at 

December 31, 2020 revealed that there is a difference of ₱8,264,684.64 between the 

balances of the agency books of ₱1,683,334.86 and COA Report on Enforcement 

and Monitoring of Final and Executory Decisions (REMFED) of ₱9,948,019.50 for 

the semester ending December 31, 2020. 

 

Analysis of the difference between the balances per books and the REMFED 

showed that seven Notice of Disallowances (NDs) totaling ₱9,948,019.50 with 

corresponding issued NFDs were not recognized in the books of CDA Central 

Office. 

 

Inquiry with the Accounting Division personnel informed us that they record 

the Receivables – Disallowances/Charges account upon the receipt of ND. 



50 

 

However, it can be concluded that the difference between COA and Accounting 

Records does not clearly support the idea.  

 

Further, review of the subsidiary ledger (SL) reveals that of the 

₱1,683,334.86 balance of Receivables – Disallowances/Charges, is a total negative 

amount of ₱2,113,094.62, thus the total positive amounts are equal to 

₱3,796,429.48. Also, disallowances of ₱444,391.79 in the SL were described as 

“No breakdown.”  

 

Lastly, the following NDs with NFD remained unsettled as of December 31, 

2020, contrary to Item 5.4 of COA Circular 2009-006, which provides that an audit 

suspension/disallowance shall be settled by the persons responsible or liable 

through compliance with the requirements, or payment/restitution or by any modes 

of extinguishment of obligation provided by law, respectively.

            Total 9,948,019.50 

  

The discrepancy between the balances of the COA Records/Reports and the 

books, and the existence of negative amounts on the account, casted doubt on the 

reliability of the account balance as at December 31, 2020. 

 

On the other hand, Section 7.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated 

September 15, 2009 prescribes the use of the RRSA provides that the head of the 

Agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property 

pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: a) the required financial and other 

reports and statements are submitted by the concerned agency officials in such form 

and within the period prescribed by the Commission; b) the settlement of 

disallowances and charges is made within the prescribed period; c) the 

requirements of transactions suspended in audit are complied with; and d) 

appropriate actions are taken on the deficiencies noted contained in the Audit 

Observation Memorandum (AOM). 

 

While Section 7.2.1 of the same COA Circular clearly states that the Chief 

Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting and/or 

bookkeeping functions of the audited agency shall ensure that the audit 

suspensions, disallowances and charges including their settlements are properly 

monitored. 



51 

 

 

 

Likewise, RRSA 5.4 reads as: 

 

An audit suspension or disallowance/charge shall be settled by 

the persons responsible or liable therefor through compliance 

with the requirements, or payment/restitution or by any of the 

modes of extinguishment of obligation provided by law, 

respectively.  Xxx. 

 

COA REMFED showed that the balance of the ND of CDA Central Office 

and Manila, Naga and Iloilo EOs reflected a ₱28,881,583.73 balance as at year-end, 

details as follows:

Naga EO 27,506.37 - - 27,506.37

     Total 28,881,583.73 - - 28,881,583.73 

 

There was no settlement noted during the year; hence, balance remained in 

the books as of December 31, 2020.   

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant 

to: 

 

a)  Reconcile the subsidiary ledgers with the COA REMFED on audit 

disallowances, to establish the correct balance of the Receivables-

Disallowances/Charges account;  

 

b)  Recognize only in the books the Receivables – Disallowances/Charges 

account when and NFD was issued; and 

 

c)  Enforce the settlement of audit disallowances in compliance with RRSA 

provided under COA Circular 2009-006. 

 

Management’s comment: 

 

In NAGA EO, Management commented that there are six former CDA 

employees listed with specific disallowances.  Five are already deceased and one 

has migrated to other country without securing the required clearance.   Previous 

efforts to reach-out to their family/heirs in order for us to resolve this issue proved 

futile. The family of the deceased employee refused to furnish us a copy of the 

death certificate despite diligent efforts.  We shall again exert efforts to follow your 

recommendation. 



52 

 

 

 

Unreconciled PPE balance, erroneous recording of PPE 
 

3. The PPE account balances of six EOs as of December 31, 2020 are unreliable 
due to: a) property records between Property and Accounting Offices not 

updated and reconciled; b) PPE listed in IIRUP were not dropped from the 

books; and c) incorrect computation of depreciation expense and non-

recognition of Accumulated Depreciation on transferred items; thus, not in 

accordance with the provisions stated in Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM. 

 

a) Property records between Property and Accounting Offices were not updated 

and reconciled 

 

Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I states that the Chief 

Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE which shall be kept 

to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, 

depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For 

check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain PC 

for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The 

balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting 

Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like PARs. 

 

In Pampanga and Calamba EOs, PPELC and PC were not updated as of the 

count, non-reconciliation of records between the Accounting and Property Office; 

accountability and control for the custody/use of PPE was not clearly established 

due to non-issuance and/or renewal of PAR on some issued PPE to end-users; and 

absence of Property Sticker/Number on each newly acquired/purchased PPE. 

Inquiry with the Pampanga EO Supply Officer disclosed that there was no proper 

information dissemination for the transfer of PPE, thus, making it difficult for him 

to locate the said PPE and update the PARs.  

 

Likewise, in CARAGA and Cebu EOs, RPCPPE and accounting books have 

a total difference of due ₱706,972.83 and ₱1,358,493.85, respectively, due to non-

periodic reconciliation. 

 

b) In CARAGA EO, PPE listed in IIRUP were not dropped from the books 
 

Section 40 (d) of the same Chapter of GAM provides that all unserviceable 

property shall be reported in the IIRUP. PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be 

dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and 

Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation). 

 

In CARAGA EO, unserviceable Office and Information and Communication 

Technology (ICT) Equipment amounting to ₱38,300.00 and ₱468,388.65, 

respectively, listed in IIRUP prepared by the Property Office were still recorded 

under the PPE accounts and not derecognized contrary to Section 40(d), Chapter 



53 

 

10, Volume I of GAM for NGAs. The non-derecognition of the unserviceable 

assets resulted in the overstatement of the PPE accounts.  

 

c) In CARAGA EO, the computation of depreciation expense was incorrectly 

computed and in Cebu EO no depreciation expense was recorded for ICT 

Equipment 
 

Audit revealed that the carrying amount of various PPE items in CARAGA 

EO was inaccurate due to the failure of the Accountant to provide the appropriate 

amount of depreciation. Recomputation of the provision for depreciation for each 

item reported in the PPE account in its financial statements based on the list of PPE 

obtained from the Accountant showed a discrepancy of ₱174,821.08.  Further, in 

Cebu EO, no depreciation expense was recognized for its ICT Equipment. The 

depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation accounts were understated 

while the corresponding Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) was overstated. 

 

d) In MIMAROPA EO, initial recording of PPE was incorrect 

 

The Accountant at the MIMAROPA recognized the PPE transferred from 

CDA Central Office at acquisition cost totaling ₱1,504,820.19. However, it did not 

account the accumulated depreciation previously recognized by the CDA Central 

Office considering that the properties were mostly acquired in previous years. 

Inquiry revealed that MIMAROPA EO was unable to secure the corresponding JEV 

drawn by the CDA Central Office to derecognize the transferred property.   

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) Require the Accountant and Property/Supply Officer of CARAGA and 
Cebu EOs, that in the event that there is discrepancy between the 

RPCPPE and the PPELC, they should reconcile the differences noted to 

have a reliable balance and fair presentation of the financial statements; 

 

b) Direct the Supply Officers of Pampanga and Calamba EOs to issue 

Property Sticker/Number for newly acquired/purchased PPE in order to 

identify and trace the location of the said PPE, and to issue the necessary 

PARs for those issued PPE under the care of the end-users as required 

by the regulation. Copies of the PARs should be kept on file, maintained 

and provided for each recipient which will form part of the records as 

basis for their renewal every third year after issue; and 

 

c) Direct the Accountant of CARAGA, Cebu and MIMAROPA EOs to 

effect the necessary adjustments on accounting errors to correct the 

balances of the affected accounts in the financial statements. Henceforth, 

record transactions by properly observe the accounting guidelines 

prescribed in the GAM. 

 



54 

 

 

Non-recording of Intangible Assets 

 

4. Maintenance of the Cooperative Business Matching Information System 
(CBMIS) Project totaling ₱900,000.00 which satisfies the criteria for the 

recognition of an Intangible Assets under paragraph 55 of Philippine Public 

Sector Accounting Standards (PPSAS) 31 was inadvertently recorded as an 

outright expense under the Other MOOE - Website Maintenance, thus, 

understating the Intangible Asset account by the project cost and 

Accumulated Surplus account of same amount at year-end.   

 

Section 12, Chapter 12, Volume I of GAM for NGAs states that subsequent 

expenditure on an intangible asset shall be recognized as an expense when it is 

incurred, unless it is probable that this expenditure will enable the asset to generate 

future economic benefits in excess of its originally assessed standard of 

performance and the expenditure can be measured and attributed to the asset 

reliably. 

 

Further, paragraph 41(c) of PPSAS 31 on Intangible Assets states that 

subsequent expenditure on an in-process research or development project acquired 

separately and recognized as an intangible asset is added to the carrying amount of 

the acquired in-process research or development project if it is development 

expenditure that satisfies the following recognition criteria as provided under 

paragraph 55 of the same PPSAS: 

 

a. The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it 
will be available for use or sale; 

b. Its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it; 
c. Its ability to use or sell the intangible asset; 
d. How that intangible asset will generate probable future economic 

benefits or service potential. Among other things, the entity can 

demonstrate the existence of a market for the output of the 

intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used 

internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset; 

e. The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources 
to complete the development to use or sell the intangible asset; and 

f. Its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the 
intangible asset during its development. 

 

Section 57(e) of the same standard likewise provides that website costs and 

software development costs are examples of development activities.  

 

Under Section 2 of the contract, the provider shall be hired to do the 

following: 

 

2.1  Maintenance of the CBMIS: 



55 

 

2.1.1 System Maintenance and Reconfiguration Activities;       

2.1.1.1  Configuration and update of the operating system; 

2.1.1.2  Database maintenance; 

2.1.1.3 Protection, detection and cleaning of malware including 

the   installation of the SSL; 

2.1.1.4  Integrate with the existing CDA mission-critical system; 

and 

2.1.1.5  Others, if applicable 

 

2.1.2 Inclusion of the following modules: 

    2.1.2.1 Module platform where buyer and seller can talk on their 

transactions; 

    2.1.2.2 Module for E-Payment mechanism; 

    2.1.2.3 Module for Spatial mapping feature; and 

    2.1.2.4 Module Dashboard on the number of coops with products, 

by commodities;    

 

2.2  System Implementation; 

2.3 System Training; 

2.4 System and Maintenance Documentation; and 

2.5 Technical Support. 

 

On November 10, 2020, the agency entered into contract with One Resouce 

Lab Software Technologies Inc. on the Maintenance of the CBMIS Project with a 

total contract cost of ₱900,000.00.  

 

The Maintenance of the CBMIS Project was completed and paid in four 

tranches. Upon payment of the same, it was recognized in the books as Other 

MOOE – Website Maintenance instead of Intangible Assets – Computer Software. 

Based on the criteria stated in paragraph 55 of PPSAS 31, the CBMIS Project 

amounting ₱900,000.00 qualifies to be capitalized rather than recognized as 

outright expense. The inadvertent recording of the said project to Other MOOE – 

Website Maintenance overstated that account by ₱900,000.00 and understated the 

Intangible Asset – Computer Software by the same amount. 

 

Further, it was noted that the first CBMIS project was recognized in the books 

as Intangible Assets – Computer Software which has a total carrying value of 

₱291,600.00 as of December 31, 2020, 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant to capitalize the costs incurred on the CBMIS Project and prepare 

necessary adjustment to the affected accounts, as required under PPSAS 31 

 

 

 

 



56 

 

Doubtful balances of Financial Liabilities 
 

5. The accuracy of the financial liabilities totaling ₱16,052,902.86 as at December 
31, 2020 of CDA Central Office is doubtful due to the: a) existence of accounts 

payables amounting ₱1,280,539.19 outstanding for two to six years; b) 

existence of negative amounts totaling ₱1,595,053.74; and c) due to Officers 

and Employees account with a total balance of ₱1,071,137.98 that includes 

claimants who are no longer regular or casual employees of CDA as of 

December 31, 2020. 

 

The Revised Chart of Accounts, Volume III of GAM states that Accounts 

Payable is used to recognize receipt of goods or services on account in the normal 

course of trade and business operation. Moreover, the Due to Officers and 

Employees is used to recognize incurrence of liability to officers and employees for 

salaries, benefits and other emoluments including authorized expenses advanced by 

the officers and employees. Both the Accounts Payable and Due to Officers and 

Employees accounts are under the financial liabilities of the agency. 

  

Executive Order No. 87 s. 2019 directing all accounts payable which remain 

outstanding for two years or more in the books of National Government Agencies 

be reverted to the accumulated surplus or deficit of the general fund or the 

cumulative result of operations of the National Government. It states that the 

existence of prior years’ accounts payable in the books of accounts of agencies 

unnecessarily immobilizes public funds, hampers efforts to determine the actual 

financial condition of the national government, and hinders effective resource 

planning and allocation, xxx. 

 

The CDA Central Office financial liabilities of ₱16,052,902.86 as at 

December 31, 2020 is composed of ₱12,795,337.25 Accounts Payable and 

₱3,257,565.61 Due to Officers and Employees. 

 

 Review of the subsidiary ledgers of the accounts revealed that: 

 

a) Existence of accounts payables outstanding for two to six years, as 
follows: 

 

Year 
Prior Year's 

Balances (₱) 

No. of Years 

Outstanding 

2014 1,929.00 6 

2015 792,207.79 5 

2016 203,022.40 4 

2017 229,494.26 3 

2018 53,885.74 2 

Total 1,280,539.19  

  



57 

 

The Accounts Payable of ₱1,280,539.19 or 10 percent of the account 

balance is outstanding from two to six years in the books of the agency. The 

amount was not reverted back to the accumulated surplus or deficit of the 

general fund or the cumulative result of operations of the National 

Government as required under Executive Office No. 87 s. 2019. 

 

b) Existence of negative amounts 
 

From CY 2011 to 2019, the Financial Liabilities contain negative 

amounts of ₱617,840.19 on the Accounts Payable and ₱977,213.35 from Due 

to Officers and Employees, totaling ₱1,595,053.74. Details are as follows:

2014 - (63,680.00)  (63,680.00)

2017 (386.55) (27,845.82)  (28,232.37) 

2018 (321,086.93) (483,724.81)  (804,811.74) 

2019 - (144,721.60)  (144,721.60) 

Total (617,840.19) (977,213.55)  (1,595,053.74) 

 

Inquiry to the Supervising Administrative Officer in the Accounting 

Division revealed that the negative amounts were the result of over crediting 

to employees’ accounts against payroll prepared. She further described that 

there were instances that the agency inadvertently credited to the employee’s 

account and later found out that he/she was not qualified for the benefit, 

however, these errors were also inadvertently committed on the Accounts 

Payable, which were not corrected during those years. 

 

It is noteworthy to emphasize that Accounts Payable and Due to 

Officers and Employees accounts shall only be credited upon incurrence of 

liability to creditors employees, respectively and credited upon settlement, 

thus, having a negative amount is not normal and the account balance is 

considered inaccurate. 

 

c) Creditors/Claimants were no longer regular/casual employees of CDA as 
of December 31, 2020. 

 

Review of the SL of the Due to Officers and Employees and 

verification from the Human Resource Section, showed that 23 persons with a 

total balance of ₱1,071,137.98, were no longer regular or casual employees of

the agency as of December 31, 2020, thus, overstating the Due to Officers 

and Employees account and understating Other Payables account by the same 

amount. 

 

Among the 23 persons, 20 were previously CDA employees 2 were job 

orders and 1 was not recognized by the Human Resource Section. Further, as 

of December 31, 2020 the Report on Prior Year’s Unpaid Authorized 

Personnel Benefit submitted to COA has none. 

 

The effect of prior years’ accounts payable outstanding for more than two 

years in the books of accounts of the agency, as stated in Executive Office No, 87 s. 

2019; as well as, existence of negative amounts and inclusion of claimants who are 

not a regular/casual employee of CDA as of December 31, 2020, hamper efforts to 

determine actual financial condition of the agency, specifically determined that the 

balance of financial liabilities is doubtful. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant to: 

 

a)  Revert to the Accumulated Surplus/Deficit the balance of the Accounts 

Payable which were outstanding for two years, adopting the prescribed 

guidelines in Executive Office No. 87 s. 2019; 

 

b) Analyze the balances of the accounts, specifically the negative balances 
and prepare necessary adjusting entries; and  

 

c) Reclassify to Other Payables account the Due to Officers and Employees, 
which accrue to the former employees, job order/contract of service of the 

agency. 

 

 

Incomplete supporting documents on payments of expenses 

 

6. Disbursements amounting to ₱2,801,207.38 of five EOs were not supported 
with complete documents contrary to Section 5, Chapter 2, Volume I of GAM, 

and COA Circular 2012-001, thereby casting doubts on the validity and 

propriety of expenditures.  

 

Section 5, Chapter 2 of the GAM, Volume I provides, among others, that 

claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation. 

Moreover, Section 9, Chapter 6 of the same Manual states that documentary 

requirements for common government transactions depending on the nature of 

expenses to be paid shall be complied with pursuant to COA Circular No. 2012-001 

dated June 14, 2012, which prescribes the Revised Guidelines and Documentary 

Requirements for Common Government Transactions.

COA Circular No. 2017-001 dated June 19, 2017 provides that expenses 

incurred by government officials and employees in the discharge of their official 

functions amounting to ₱300.00 or less need not be supported by official receipts, 

except for the following: 

 

a. Payment of fares in public utility vehicles issuing receipts; and 
b. Purchases in business establishments issuing receipts. 

   

The officials/employees concerned shall only be required to submit a 

Certification of Expenses Not Requiring Receipts (CENRR) as a supporting 

document to such claims. 

 

Inquiry with the designated Accountant of Iloilo EO revealed that she might 

have overlooked the completeness of supporting documents due to the volume of 

work and the effect of alternative work arrangements brought about by the ongoing 

pandemic. Differences in interpretation on the required documents to support 

payment of Taxi and PUJ fares and the proper use of the CENRR were also noted. 

 

Paragraph 2 of the Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 2-2014 dated January 

13, 2014 provides that:  

 

 Sales Invoice (Cash or Charge) shall be issued as Principal evidence 
in the sale of goods and/or properties;  

 Official Receipt shall be issued as Principal evidence in the sale of 
services and/or lease of properties; and  

 Commercial Receipts/Invoices such as delivery receipts, order slips, 
purchase orders, provisional receipts, acknowledgment receipts, 

collection receipts, credit/debit memo, job orders and other similar 

documents that form part of the accounting records of the taxpayer 

and/or issued to their customers evidencing delivery, agreement to 

sell or transfer of goods and services, shall be Supplementary 

evidence only. 

  

In Kidapawan EO, disbursement vouchers (DVs) for office rentals at Marawi 

City Satellite Office for CY 2018 to CY 2020 totaling ₱753,000.00 were approved 

and paid without supporting ORs as evidence of payment, thereby, depriving the 

government of collecting the correct taxes.  

 

It was also observed that additional documentary requirement for rental 

contracts such as complete copy of the building floor plans, complete description of 

the building, list of prevailing comparable property within vicinity, vicinity map 

and certificate of occupancy were not attached, contrary to Section 4 (6) of PD No. 

1445 which provides that claims against government funds shall be supported with 

complete documentation. 

 



61 

 

In CDO EO, payment of job orders salary totaling ₱413,055.07 was not 

supported with accomplishment reports, which is one of the required supporting 

documents for the salary of casual/contractual personnel as provided under Section 

4.1.3 of COA Circular 2012-001. 

 

Payments of claims despite the absence of necessary supporting documents, 

casts doubt on the validity and propriety of disbursements, and may result to the 

issuance of Notice of Suspension (NS) and/or ND. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) require both the Accountant and the Cashiers of Calamba, MIMAROPA, 
Iloilo, Kidapawan and CDO EOs to exercise due diligence in the 

processing of disbursements especially in the provisions of required 

attachments/supporting documents; and 

 

b) direct the Accountants to submit the lacking documents for further 
evaluation and appropriate audit disposition. 

 

Management comments: 

 

The Kidapawan EO Management explained that during the implementation of 

the Bangon Marawi Project last 2018, the management tried to locate an area for 

the Satellite Office of the project but due to scarcity of building to occupy as 

Marawi was still under rehabilitation, the management resulted to rent a residential 

area that was not registered to BIR, thus, could not issue its official receipts, 

instead, acknowledgment receipts were issued for the payment received. For its 

future occupancy, the management will require the lessor to at least provide them 

its tax identification number so that they can properly withhold the amount of taxes 

appropriate for the said rentals. Management will also refrain from paying in 

advance the services not yet rendered.   

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

We further recommended that Management still deduct the taxes due to the 

lessor and remit the same to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) even if the lessor 

cannot provide its tax identification number. 

 

 

B.  Compliance Audit 

 

Audit of the MRTC Project: 
 

Beneficiaries registered only after the Marawi Siege 
 

7. Twenty-nine cooperative beneficiaries of the MRTC Project were registered 
only after the Marawi Siege; hence, not compliant with the target beneficiaries 



62 

 

as specified in the Approved Project Proposal, defeating the objective of the 

MRTC Project, which is the reactivation of active cooperatives that were 

displaced by the Marawi Siege. 

 

The Approved Project Proposal, submitted by CDA Administrator from 

Mindanao, focuses on assisting the 73 active cooperatives and 36,135 individual 

beneficiaries (including their families), in Marawi and nearby areas where internally 

displaced persons (IDPs) seek refuge.  It further states that its objective is the 

reactivation and provision of business and livelihood opportunities for the 73 active 

cooperatives, which were displaced by the Marawi Siege.   

 

The conceptual framework of the Approved Project Proposal states that: 

The goal of this project is to reactivate the 73 existing 

cooperatives in the Marawi City to provide business and 

livelihood opportunities to the residents. These 

cooperatives will be utilized to advance the quality of life 

of the residents and create economic development in the 

area.  

Per our verification, the Project Management Team reported that it was able 

to surpass its beneficiaries’ coverage, 103 versus the original target of 73 for 

implementing year 2018-2019. The Kidapawan EO then took advantage of this 

increased coverage to accommodate more IDPs. However, upon validation of the 

list of beneficiaries, it was noted that there were 29 cooperative beneficiaries that 

were registered only after the liberation of Marawi Siege in October 2017. Hence, it 

means that there were only 74 cooperative beneficiaries (103-29) that were active 

before the siege and are considered eligible beneficiaries of the Project. 

 

The table on Annex C shows the 29 cooperative beneficiaries that were 

ineligible but nevertheless received a total of ₱17,744,000.00 in financial grant for 

their livelihood assistance program, of which ₱5,714,000.00 remained unliquidated 

as of December 31, 2020. 

  

Also, among the objectives of the Approved Project Proposal framework are 

to a) expand cooperatives membership reach of at least 50 percent of the populace 

of Marawi City; b) ensure that the project will be inclusive; and c) that massive 

expansion of membership in the cooperative will be promoted among residents 

utilizing the existing cooperatives of their choice.   

 

In view of the query made by the Audit Team on the inclusion, as 

beneficiaries, of the 29 cooperatives that were registered only after the Marawi 

Siege, the CDA passed Board Resolution No. 446, series of 2019 on September 17, 

2019, approving the definition of Membership Expansion as “the strategy of 

increasing the number of members in the cooperative either in the form of 

organizing a new cooperative or making a non-member be a member of an existing 

cooperative”. 



63 

 

 

However, this Board Resolution No. 446, series of 2019 is contrary to the 

Approved Project Proposal framework, which states that the expansion of 

membership must be coming from the existing cooperatives and not through the 

creation or registration of new cooperatives. Moreover, the fundamental goal of the 

Approved Project Proposal is the reactivation of the 73 existing cooperatives that 

were displaced by the Marawi siege. 

 

As can be gleaned from the table, the cooperatives in the list were registered 

only from four to thirteen months after the end of the siege; hence, were not 

existing and not active before the Marawi siege. 

 

We recommended that Management identify the officials who included 

the 29 ineligible cooperative beneficiaries of the MRTC Project and hold them 

liable for non-compliance with the Approved Project Proposal, as well as with 

the Policy Guidelines.  

 

Management commented that the 103 cooperatives, including the 29 

cooperatives registered after the liberation of Marawi Siege in October 2017 under 

the “Membership Expansion” as part of the project eligible beneficiaries, were in 

compliance with the approved project proposal of the MRTC Project and the 

relating project policy guidelines. This is in view of promoting the viability and 

growth of these cooperatives as instruments for social justice and economic 

development in Marawi City and other affected areas in Lanao del Sur, the vital 

aim of which is to widen our countrymen’s access to opportunities in the area that 

would take them out of the quagmire of poverty brought about by the siege.  

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team claimed that Board Resolution No. 446, series of 2019 does 

not address the issue being raised since the goal of the MRTC Project which is 

explicitly stated in the approved project documents, for the reactivation and 

provision of business and livelihood opportunities only to the 73 existing 

cooperative in Marawi City. The said Board Resolution only defines the 

Membership Expansion and does not even mention for what specific purpose it was 

approved. 

 

 

Non-compliance with the provisions of Policy Guidelines on the MRTC Project funds 
 

8. In Kidapawan EO, non-monitoring of the project implementation by the 
assigned CDA personnel and non-submission of the monthly report on the 

implementation of the MRTC Project resulted in the unliquidated financial 

assistance totaling ₱11,314,000.00 granted to 44 beneficiaries, for more than 

seven up to 31 months, contrary to Section IV, Items 2 and 3 of the Policy 

Guidelines and to the provisions of the MOA between CDA and the 

cooperative beneficiaries. 



64 

 

Section IV, Item 2 of the Policy Guidelines provides that within 30 days after 

the full implementation of the project, the respective beneficiaries shall submit the 

liquidation reports and the required supporting documentations; and that the 

Accountant, after the evaluation of the submitted documents, shall record the 

liquidation in the books of accounts by crediting the Due to NGOs/POs account that 

was used to take up the release of funds to the beneficiaries. 

 

While Section IV, Item 3 provides that to ensure the proper utilization of the 

funds, the cooperative beneficiaries shall be required to submit project progress 

report to the Kidapawan EO as indicated in the MOA. Such shall be monitored by 

the CDA personnel assigned in the area vis-à-vis the Approved Project Proposal 

and shall submit monthly report on the project implementation.  

 

The total amount granted to cooperatives for Business and Livelihood 

activities of the MRTC Project was ₱52,046,000.00. Of that amount, 

₱34,302,000.00 was granted to the 74 eligible cooperative beneficiaries and 

₱17,744,000.00 was granted to the 29 ineligible cooperative beneficiaries, as 

discussed above.   

 

The COA Audit Team of Kidapawan EO reported that as of December 31, 

2020, the financial assistance of ₱11,314,000.00 or 24.33 percent of the total grants 

extended to the 103 cooperative beneficiaries remained outstanding for more than 

seven up to 31 months. Of the said amount, ₱6,950,000.00 or 54.88 percent were 

due from the eligible beneficiaries and ₱5,714,000.00 or 45.12 percent were due 

from the ineligible beneficiaries. 

 

The same COA Audit Team likewise noted that the Kidapawan EO personnel 

assigned to monitor the project did not prepare and submit the monthly report on 

the project implementation as required. Thus, it can be deduced that no monitoring 

was done by the assigned Kidapawan EO personnel assigned to do the job. 

 

The non-monitoring of the MRTC Project implementation and the non-

submission of the required monthly reports by the assigned Kidapawan EO 

personnel resulted in the non-liquidation of the financial assistance granted to 

cooperative beneficiaries; hence, not compliant with the pertinent provisions of the 

Policy Guidelines and the corresponding MOA, casting doubt on whether the 

livelihood programs of the MRTC Project were actually implemented. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to compel the personnel 

assigned to Kidapawan EO to monitor and submit the monthly report on the 

implementation of the MRTC Project, and directs the cooperative 

beneficiaries to liquidate the outstanding financial assistance as of December 

31, 2020, in compliance with the provisions of the Policy Guidelines and the 

MOA between CDA and the cooperative beneficiaries. 

 

 



65 

 

 

Non-implementation of database for the MRTC Project  
 

9. There is a need to implement the database/information system relative to the 
MRTC Project so that efforts of the Kidapawan EO in attaining a holistic 

picture of how well the objective of the Project had been adequately attained 

and to avoid the multi grant of financial assistance to the same beneficiaries.  

 

Inquiry with the concerned personnel revealed that at present there is no data 

as to how much was granted as financial assistance to members and to cooperatives 

nor which were the intended beneficiaries. The breakdown of financial assistance 

provided would be used to collect and collate data as to funds released to 

cooperative beneficiaries for planning and decision-making purposes. On the other 

hand, the database for beneficiaries would be used primarily for information-

sharing among government agencies involved in MRTC Project to guard against 

multi-availment of the projects and for statistical and planning and decision-making 

purposes as well. Only the profile of the cooperatives who received the assistance 

was available. 

 

The establishment and the implementation of the information system for 

Projects would greatly enhance the effective accomplishment of its mandated 

functions especially in the formulation and in coordination and monitoring of 

cooperative beneficiaries. For instance, information on how much funding is still 

needed or how many cooperatives and its members were benefited from the MRTC 

Project or are awaiting assistance at Marawi would be readily available for 

planning and decision-making purposes. In turn, these would enhance the effective 

achievement of the project. 

 

The database which will generate reports and statistics on performance of the 

cooperative beneficiaries, the implementation of the MRTC Project, would provide 

vital data and information for planning and decision-making purposes. Statistics on 

the performance of a cooperative beneficiaries would provide basis for concluding 

whether the intentions of the project have been delivered and whether it has 

contributed to the accomplishment of the MRTC Project. 

 

Statistics on the implementation of the MRTC Project would show whether 

assistance are being allocated in the right areas, and are given to the right 

beneficiaries, it would also reveal whether the assistance granted was in the right 

time and amount. And to determine which areas still needed assistance. 

 

Thus, the non-implementation of the database/information systems may lead 

to poor planning and decision-making by concerned officials. In addition, the 

efforts of the government in attaining a holistic picture of how well the MRTC 

Project has done and how far it has gone is not facilitated. 

 



66 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to implement the 

database/information system relative to the MRTC Project and other Agency 

projects for statistical and planning and decision-making purposes. 

 

Management committed to comply with the audit recommendation as soon as 

possible. It said that it has already had most of the data and what is lacking is the 

migration of those data to an appropriate database format which they are working 

right now. 

 

Also, Management said that there were cooperatives which were not 

concerned about the reports’ submission. They only submitted invoices, receipts 

and other documents without proper documentations. Nevertheless, the 

Management committed to assist the cooperatives for the proper documentation and 

processing of their liquidations and promised to submit the liquidation reports to 

the Audit Team as soon as possible.  

 

 

Beneficiaries of MRTC Project were also beneficiaries of Mindanao Peace and 

Normalization (MPAN) Through Cooperative Development Project  
 

10. In Kidapwan EO, five beneficiaries of MPAN through Cooperatives 
Development Project were also recipients of MRTC Project which received a 

total financial assistance of ₱9,608,000.00, contrary to the Revised Policy 

Guidelines in the Selection of Beneficiaries under the MPAN through 

Cooperative Development Project. 

 

Item (e), No.2, Part IV of the General Guidelines of CDA Office Order No. 

2019-08, Series of 2019 or the Revised Policy Guidelines in the Selection of 

Beneficiaries, Disbursement, Liquidation, Procurement and Monitoring of Funds 

under the MPAN through Cooperative Development Project provides that a 

cooperative-beneficiaries should not be a recipient or in default in liquidating any 

public funds received from any government agency. 

 

Verification of the accounts of Kidapawan EO disclosed that five 

cooperative- beneficiaries of the MPAN through Cooperatives Development 

Project in CY 2019 were also recipients of the MRTC Projects in CY 2018 

implemented both by the agency. The financial assistance received and the status of 

liquidation of the cooperative-beneficiaries under the two programs of the agency

Under the MPAN through Cooperatives Development Project, aside from the 

qualification that the cooperative- beneficiary must not have been a recipient of any 

government funds, it was also observed that three cooperative-beneficiaries, 

specifically, the Oisca Farm MPC, Marawi Islamic Finance Service Cooperative 

and Marawi Ulama Service Cooperative, have been granted financial assistance 

even though they were in default in the liquidation of the financial assistance 

received from MRTC Projects in CY 2018. 

 

Programs or projects of the government should be properly allocated to 

qualified cooperative-beneficiaries to achieve its main goal to help the 

cooperatives. When a beneficiary was granted funds for more than one projects, the 

intention of the government was then prejudiced, thus, other qualified beneficiaries 

could not avail or enjoy what has supposed to be accorded to them. 

 

To effectively implement the foregoing provisions, the agency should 

maintain a master list against which the prospective beneficiaries should be 

checked. The master list should serve as a tool to be used in the pre-qualification 

process for the selection of beneficiaries of the MPAN through Cooperatives 

Development Project to ensure that they have not availed of the other agency’s 

project before. 

  

We recommended that Management: 

 

a) submit satisfactory explanations for including the five cooperatives 
which were recipients of MRTC Project in the selection and granting of 

financial assistance under MPAN through Cooperatives Development 

Project; 

 



68 

 

b) ensure that the pre-qualification process is coordinated and the master 
list is checked to make sure that only those qualified beneficiaries could 

avail of the projects and that they can avail of them once; 

 

c) Refrain from granting additional financial assistance when the previous 
assistance from MRTC Project was not yet liquidated contrary to the 

General Guidelines of CDA Office Order No. 2019-08, Series of 2019 or 

the Revised Policy Guidelines in the Selection of Beneficiaries, 

Disbursement, Liquidation, Procurement and Monitoring of Funds 

under the MPAN through Cooperatives Development Project; and 

 

d) Maintain a database of all beneficiaries of the projects implemented by 
the agency in order to avoid the redundant granting of financial 

assistance same beneficiaries. 

 

The Management explained that the beneficiaries of the MPAN through 

Cooperatives Development Project were pre-identified and the only option for them 

was to release the project, after submitting the required documents, to the identified 

beneficiaries who even had prior knowledge than them that they were the 

beneficiaries of the project.  Depriving those cooperatives of their projects will 

create some problems. The Management further explained that the beneficiaries of 

the MRTC included all the cooperatives in Marawi City that were registered prior 

to Marawi siege and those that are going to be organized by the returning evacuees 

after the declaration of liberation from the ISIS.  Supposed to be, it is the MRTC 

that has a restrictive qualification for beneficiaries such as to exclude those coops 

that got projects from other sources.  Unfortunately, it has none.  The CDA Board 

did not put any restriction as to who will be included, may be due to human 

consideration that all in Marawi City suffered badly in the war and everybody has 

to be rehabilitated as soon as possible.  So, for them as the implementing unit, they 

have to follow the basic qualifications that as long as it is a cooperative registered 

in Marawi City. 

 

The Management will see to it that this observation will be forwarded to the 

CDA Board for consideration in the crafting of guidelines for future projects. 

 

In the Audit Team rejoinder, it emphasized that although the MRTC Project 

was silent as to restrictions to exclude those cooperatives that got projects from 

other sources, the MPAN through Cooperatives Development Project provides that 

a cooperative-beneficiaries should not be a recipient or in default in liquidating any 

public funds received from any government agency. Thus, the audit team maintains 

its audit observation and recommendations that only those qualified beneficiaries 

should avail of the projects and that they should avail of them once.  

 

We further recommended that Kidapawan EO request from the CDA 

Board satisfactory explanations for including in the MPAN through 



69 

 

Cooperatives Development Project beneficiaries the cooperatives which were 

already recipients of MRTC Project. 

 

 

Result of audit of the MPAN through Cooperatives Development Project  

 

11. The objectives of the MPAN through Cooperatives Development Project were 
not fully attained due to various deficiencies noted in its implementation in 

Kidapawan EO which likewise resulted in the unliquidated project fund of 

₱18,750,000.00, and in Pagadian EO the project was not completed in CY 2019 

as envisioned for laxity of personnel in monitoring the activities of the Project. 

  

In Kidapawan EO, the following deficiencies were noted in the implementation of 

the project: 

 

a)  Unliquidated financial assistance 

 

Upon verification of the accounts of the Kidapawan EO as of December 31, 

2020, it was observed that the balance of the account Due from NGOs/POs was 

₱41,746,432.70. Out of the total amount, ₱18,750,000.00 represents financial 

assistance granted to 76 cooperative beneficiaries under MPAN through 

Cooperatives Development Project. Said amount remained unliquidated for 11 to 

26 months. 

  

The non-liquidation of financial assistance granted to cooperative 

beneficiaries under the MPAN through Cooperatives Development Project  casts 

doubt whether the projects were implemented or whether the financial assistance 

were received by the intended beneficiary. 

 

b) Additional Operating Capital totaling ₱1,000,000.00 were provided to five 

beneficiaries without basis 

 

The purpose of the fund is to provide financial and technical assistance to 

support the Post-harvest facilities and livelihood projects of identified cooperatives 

in Mindanao areas amounting to ₱900,000.00 per beneficiaries broken down as 

follows: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We obtained the guidelines being followed by the Agency as to the amount 

on the grant of financial assistance for CY 2018-2019. However, on CY 2020, 

contrary to what was provided for in the policy guidelines, additional financial 

assistance was granted to five cooperatives over the maximum amount of

It was likewise noted that the previous financial assistance granted to the five 

cooperatives totaling ₱1,250,000.00 remained unliquidated as of December 31, 

2020. 

 

In order to institutionalize a uniform and/or equitable grant of financial 

assistance, it is essential that the Agency must follow the existing guidelines. Non-

compliance with the said guidelines creates an opportunity for possible misuse of 

government funds. 

 

c) Inclusion of beneficiaries from non-conflict-affected areas 

 

Among the objectives of the project is to identify organized and registered 

cooperatives in Mindanao conflict-affected areas and provide livelihood assistance 

and rice mills to the pre-identified cooperatives. It intends to positively contribute 

to the normalization process in the areas of conflict in Mindanao through a 

development package. 

 

The Audit Team requested the list of conflict-affected areas in Region 12 and 

BARMM for CY 2018-2020 to assess the qualification of the identified 

beneficiaries. 

 

Evaluation of the submitted documents revealed that out of the 87 identified 

cooperative-beneficiaries, the locations of the 31 recipients or 36 percent, were not 

found in the list of Mindanao conflict-affected areas for CY 2018-2020. 



71 

 

It was observed that the selection of areas under MPAN through Cooperatives 

Development Project was not strictly based on conflict-affected areas in Mindanao, 

contrary to what was specified in the objectives in its implementation. There were 

areas which were not included in the list but were given preference over those 

living in areas which were conflict-affected, without any supporting documents to 

prove that those selected cooperatives were in conflict-affected areas. 

 

The intention is to provide livelihood assistance and rice mills to the pre-

identified cooperatives to positively contribute to the normalization process in the 

areas of conflict in Mindanao. Hence, the inclusion of beneficiaries in non-conflict-

affected areas under this project defeats the purpose for which the fund was 

established. 

 

d) Non-submission of requisite documents/database of beneficiaries 

 

Verification disclosed that the total financial assistance provided to the 87 

cooperative beneficiaries to support the post-harvest facility amounted to 

₱21,500,000.00 for CY 2018-2020. 

 

Whether the grant was in accordance with the purpose for which the 

assistance was received and/or the cooperative is a qualified recipient of the grant, 

could not be determined due to the failure of the Agency to submit the following: 

 

 Registered list of cooperatives in the ARMM Region as of December 31, 
2020 

 Data bank of beneficiaries 

 Validation report as qualified beneficiaries 

 Certificate of registration of the beneficiaries 

 Certification by the Kidapawan EO that the beneficiaries are operating and 
compliant 

 Fund Utilization report 

 Project Monitoring Report 
 

It was also noted that the database of information regarding the beneficiaries 

of the MPAN Project was not available, for accessibility of data and for sharing 

with others and allows information to be stored for future reference and easy 

retrieval. 

 

The non-submission of the documents and database of information despite 

repeated demands precluded the Audit Team from conducting a timely review and 

verification of transactions and caused uncertainty on whether the Management 

performed actual evaluations prior to the grant of financial assistance. 

 

In Pagadian EO, the objective of the project to attain the completion of the 

project at the end of CY 2019 was not fully achieved as envisioned due to laxity of 

personnel in closely monitoring the activities of the projects, hence, full 



72 

 

implementation was only done in CY 2020, which is beyond the date specified in 

the General Appropriations Act (GAA) 2019. 

 

The project fund for the current year is integrated in the 2019 CDA budget, 

amounting to ₱73,700,000.00. Target beneficiaries include 70 registered 

cooperatives.   Each one of them will receive one unit of mobile mini-rice mill and 

working capital amounting to ₱250,000.00. The implementation will be in the 

Mindanao area and is expected to be accomplished in 2019.  

  

Pagadian EO was allotted ₱4,750,000.00 through Sub-Allotment Advice 

(SAA) No. 003-09-2019-03 dated August 5, 2019 for MOOE in the implementation 

of the project. The object codes of this allotment are as follows:

     Total  4,750,000.00    

 

In CY 2020, the EO prepared a Revised Work and Financial Plan for 2019 

MPAN through Cooperatives Development Project wherein completion of the 

project was targeted in June of 2020. However, the accomplishment report showed 

that the actual completion of the project was in the last working day of December 

of 2020, which was beyond the expected date of completion.  The delay was due to 

the procurement of the mobile mini rice mill done at the CDA Central Office and 

paid at the EOs, such delayed completion of the project deprived the identified 

cooperative beneficiaries of timely livelihood assistance especially in the conflict 

areas that are exposed to violent extremist. 

 

We recommended that Management of: 

 

1)  Kidapawan EO to: 

 

a)  require for the full liquidations of the financial assistance granted to the 

cooperative beneficiaries and submit the liquidation reports thereof to 

the Audit Team, in compliance with the provisions of the Memorandum 

of Agreement between the CDA and the cooperative beneficiary; 

 

b)  provide the legal basis and the approved guidelines allowing the grant 

of additional capital to the five cooperatives;  

 

c) submit satisfactory explanations/justifications for including 

cooperatives in the non-conflict-affected areas as beneficiaries of 

MPAN through Cooperatives Development Project and ensure that the 



73 

 

beneficiaries of the project being implemented have been included in 

the list of conflict-affected areas in Mindanao; 

  

d)  create and maintain a data bank of information on beneficiaries during 

and after completion of the program;  

 

e)  submit the additional documentary requirements to determine the 

eligibility of the beneficiaries; and  

 

f) submit the project monitoring/evaluation report to gauge the 

effectiveness of the Project. 

 

2) Pagadian EO to closely coordinate with the CDA Central Office for the 

timely implementation of programs and projects for timely assistance to the 

beneficiaries and for efficient public service. 

 

 

Liquidated Damages not imposed 

 

12. Liquidated damages amounting to ₱350,317.93 were not imposed on delayed 
delivery of five units Brand New Mobile Mini Rice Mill in the implementation 

of MPAN through Cooperatives Development Project in Pagadian EO, not in 

compliance with Section 68 of RA No. 9184 and its IRR. 

 

Delayed delivery of five units Brand New Mobile Mini Rice Mill incurred 

liquidated damages amounting to ₱350,317.93 for the Implementation of MPAN 

through Cooperatives Development Project as provided in Section 68 of 2016 IRR 

of RA No. 9184.  

  

Rule XXII Section 68 of IRR RA No. 9184 provides that all contracts 

executed in accordance with the Act and this IRR shall contain a provision on 

liquidated damages which shall be payable by the contractor in case of breach 

thereof.  For the procurement of Goods, Infrastructure Projects and Consulting 

Services, the amount of liquidated damages shall be at least equal to one-tenth of 

one percent (0.001) of the cost of the unperformed portion for every day of delay.  

Once the cumulative amount of liquidated damages reaches ten percent of the 

amount of the contract, the Procuring Entity may rescind or terminate the contract, 

without prejudice to other courses of action and remedies available under the 

circumstances. 

  

The CDA Central Office procured 70 units of Brand New Mobile Mini Rice 

Mill from the winning bidder, the SULHEN & TJJ Corporation.  The total price is 

₱45,150.000.00, or ₱645,000.00 per unit.  It was indicated in the approved 

Purchase Request and in the Invitation To Bid (ITB) that the equipment will be 

delivered to the respective CDA EOs, wherein freight and other incidental costs of 

delivery of the unit will be shouldered by the supplier.  It was further indicated in 



74 

 

the ITB that the delivery of equipment is within 45 calendar days from receipt of 

the Notice to Proceed and payments for the procured equipment will be made at the 

respective EOs upon the acceptance and inspection of the delivered equipment 

together with the bidding documents as basis in preparing DV for payment of the 

following Offices: 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In Pagadian EO which is one of the recipients of the MPAN through 

Cooperatives Development Project was allotted ₱4.75 million through SAA No. 

003-09-2019-03 dated August 5, 2019 for MOOE in the implementation of the 

MPAN through Cooperatives Development Project.  Out of ₱4.75 million, ₱3.225 

million was expended for payment of the delivered 5 units Mobile Mini Rice Mill. 

Verification of List of Coop Beneficiaries under MPAN through Cooperative 

Development Project for Region IX under GAA 2019 showed that there were five 

Coop-beneficiaries which are entitled to the financial assistance in the form of one 

unit of mobile mini-rice mill.   

 

Post audit of DV and the bidding documents of SULHEN & TJJ CORP, for 

the procured five units Mobile Mini Rice Mill per JEV No. 01-2020-12-0125 dated 

December 31, 2020, DV No. 2020-02-0055 dated February 13, 2020 amounting to

As shown in the table above, the actual delivery and acceptance of the 

equipment in Pagadian City was only on September 30, 2020, hence, there was 

delay of 116 days from Notice to proceed up to date of delivery. A liquidated 

damage of one tenth of one percent for every day of delay or a total of ₱350,317.93, 

pursuant to Rule XXII Section 68 of IRR RA No. 9184 should have been imposed 

against the supplier of the Mobile Mini Rice Mill.  



76 

 

               

We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

 

a) the Accountant of Pagadian EO to scrutinize carefully the provisions 
stipulated in the contract before effecting payment and follow strictly 

Section 68 of IRR of RA No. 9184; and 

 

b) the Supplier to submit justification for the delay in delivering the 
equipment, otherwise, or require them to refund for the liquidated 

damages and deposit the same to the National Treasury. 

 

 

Non-conformity with the Registration and Operation of Cooperatives  
 

13. The Pampanga EO was deprived of the service and business income that could 
have been collected from the issuance of registration, clearance, certification 

fees, fines and penalties and other dues and contributions from cooperative 

members due to the non-compliance of 1,090 cooperatives, or 34.97 percent of 

the total registered cooperatives in Region III, with the provisions of CDA 

Office Order 2017-01, as amended, which also affected the legality of its 

operations.  

 

In line with monitoring of cooperatives, CDA Central Office Order No. 2015-

09 dated December 3, 2015 and with Office Order 2017-01 series of 2017 

amendment, the Authority issued guidelines by identifying, indicating and 

determining the status of cooperatives by preparing and submitting the 

corresponding status report to effectuate the necessary change in status of the 

cooperative in the Cooperative Registration Information System (COOPRIS).  

                        

Among others, the following were cited: 

 

Item 2. Basis for Determining the status of Cooperative: 

 

Compliant cooperatives must have submitted the required 

regular report within the prescribed period; must have been 

issued with Certificate of Compliance (COC) 

               

Cooperatives issued with COC but subjected to Show Cause Order for 

violations of laws, rules and regulations. Cooperatives with this status are those 

which submitted the required reports and were issued with COC, but were however, 

found to have violated the cooperative laws, rules and regulations upon inspection 

and/or examination. 

  

Of the CDA Office Order 2017-01 states that:  

 

Non-Compliant Cooperatives. Cooperatives under any of the 

circumstances described below will be tagged as non-compliant. 



77 

 

 

a. Cooperatives issued with Notice of Non-Submission of 

required reports. Failed to submit the required reports 

within120 days after end of the calendar year. 

b. Cooperatives issued with show cause order. 

c. Cooperatives which are under dissolution 

d. Dissolve cooperatives 

e. Cooperatives under litigation 

f. Cooperatives with cancelled status 

g. Cooperatives with delisted status 

 

Relative to this, summary of the data on the status and existence of 

cooperative unions as of December 31, 2020 is shown below: 

 

Status of Cooperatives 
No. of 

Cooperatives 
Percentage 

Compliant Coops  1,222 39.20 

New Registered Coops  116 3.73 

Non-Compliant Coops  1,090 34.97 

Coops with show cause order (SCO) 689 22.10 

         Total 3,117 100.00 

 

From the total registered cooperative of 3,117 catered by the agency 1,090 or 

34.97 percent comprises the non-compliant coops due to the following deficiencies: 

 

a. Cooperatives issued with Notice of Non-Submission of required reports.  
Failed to submit the required reports within120 days after end of the 

calendar year. 

b. Cooperatives issued with show cause order. 
c. Cooperatives which are under dissolution 
d. Dissolved cooperatives 
e. Cooperatives under litigation 
f. Cooperatives with cancelled status 
g. Cooperatives with delisted status 

 

Inquiry with the Chief of the Regulation Section who monitor the 

cooperatives disclosed that the number of non-compliant coops had increased due 

to the lapses of the primary and secondary cooperatives to comply with the regular 

reports of its program of activities, including those in pursuance of their socio-civic 

undertakings showing their progress and achievements at the end of every fiscal 

year. These reports shall be filed to the CDA within 120 days from the end of the 

calendar year. The inability to submit the required reports was due to the online 

process of submission. Mostly the officers and staff of the cooperatives are senior 

citizens, labor and agriculture sector with low technical knowledge to submit the 

reports online.  

 



78 

 

Furthermore, the Agency did not meet its target income for the year due to 

the low registration of new cooperatives. Moreover, the said section is continuously 

monitoring the cooperatives for their immediate compliance, in order for them to 

operate legally and that CDA can as well collect the necessary dues, membership 

and other fees due to them.  

  

It should be mentioned that the subject cooperatives considered non-

compliant should be monitored properly and that appropriate sanctions must be 

applied if necessary in order to protect the interest of all parties concerned 

including those transacting with the subject cooperatives.  

 

We recommended and Management of Pampanga EO agreed to: 

 

a) adopt measures to assist the cooperatives’ staff and officials to address the 

constraints brought about by the online report submission; 

 

b) continue preparing the report on the monitoring, inspection of the 

primary and secondary cooperative status and copy furnished the Audit 

Team, to enforce the Agency’s mandate, promote the viability and growth 

of cooperatives as instruments of equity, social justice and sustainable 

economic development and to generate additional business and service 

income; and 

 

c) monitor closely and properly the status of the non-compliant, considering 

the appropriate sanctions to be taken, if warranted, in order to protect the 

interest of the members and stakeholders.  
  

 

Undisposed unserviceable assets 
 

14. Various unserviceable properties totaling ₱4,383,194.10 listed in the IIRUP of 
five EOs were not disposed, contrary to the provisions of Section 79 of PD No. 

1445 and Section 40, Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM, thus, the said properties 

were subject to further deterioration and continuously occupy storage space 

for other purposes.  
 

Section 79 of PD No. 1445 on the destruction or sale of unserviceable 

property, states that when government property has become unserviceable for any 

cause, or it is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable 

therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized 

representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless 

or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence.  If found to be valuable, it may 

be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision  of the proper 

committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or 

other duly representative of the Commission, after advertising by printed notice in 

the Official Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper or 

general circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the expense 



79 

 

of publication, by notices posted for a like period in at least three public places in 

the locality where the property is to be sold.  In the event that the public auction 

fails, the property may be sold at a private auction sale at such price as may be 

fixed by the same committee or body concerned and approved by the Commission. 

 

Moreover, Section 40 (c), Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM provides that a PPE 

is said to be unserviceable if it is no longer capable of providing the entity with 

future economic benefits or service potential. 

   

Records showed that unserviceable PPE amounting ₱4,383,194.10 remained 

undisposed in five EOs. Details are as follows: 

   

Extension/Regional Office Amount (₱) 

CAR RO 99,329.10 

Tuguegarao EO 125,891.31 

Naga EO 1,956,222.76 

Iloilo EO 1,321,067.28 

CARAGA RO 880,683.65 

       Total 4,383,194.10 

   

The entity should give more attention on the disposal of its unserviceable 

properties in order to avoid or prevent further deterioration, thereby obtaining the 

fair return in case of sale, to relieve the accountable officer of unnecessary 

accountability, and make available space for the Agency. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Disposal 

Committee of the concerned EOs, to act on the immediate disposal of the 

unserviceable properties in accordance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445, and 

furnish the Accounting of the disposal documents for proper derecognition in 

the books. 

 

 

Approved travel for more than 30 days 
 

15. Reimbursements of travel expenses of more than 30 days by CDA employees 
assigned at Marawi City Satellite Office were approved by the head of the 

agency instead of the Department Secretary or his equivalent, contrary to 

Section 5 of Executive Order No. 248 as amended by Executive Order No. 298 

dated March 23, 2004. 

 

Section 5 of Executive Order No. 248 as amended by Section 3 of Executive 

Order No. 298 dated March 23, 2004 states that: 

 

Travels of officials and employees of National Government Agencies 

for less than thirty (30) days and payment of travel expenses therefore 

shall be approved by the head of the office/bureau or equivalent. 



80 

 

Travels that will last (30) days or more and payment of travel 

expenses therefore shall be approved by the Department Secretary or 

his equivalent. The approval of the Department Secretary concerned 

shall be construed as equivalent to the approval of the Secretary of 

Budget and Management. 

 

During the post-audit of disbursements, it was noted that reimbursements of 

traveling expenses by CDA employees assigned at Marawi City Satellite Office 

lasted for 92-122 days. The number of actual days traveled per employee in CY 

2018. 

 

It was also observed that the above employees were allowed to claim 

reimbursement of travels even during weekends and holidays. 

  

Further verification of the documents submitted showed that travels lasted for 

30 days or more and payment of travel expenses thereof, were authorized and 

approved by the head of the office instead of the Department Secretary or his 

equivalent contrary to Section 5 of Executive Order No. 248 as amended by Section 

3 of Executive Order No. 298 dated March 23, 2004. Thus, the validity and legality 

of the disbursements could not be properly ascertained. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed: 
 

a) issue authority for travels of more than 30 days pursuant to Section 3 of 
Executive Order No. 298 dated March 23, 2004; and 

 

b) require the concerned Accountant to see to it that all DVs and travel 
claims are properly signed and authorized and check the completeness of 

supporting documents of each transaction prior to payment.  

 

The Management apologized for overlooking the length of travel for more 

than one month and proposes that the excess of the 30-day limit and the Saturdays 

and Sundays and Holidays will be refunded by the concerned employees as it is 

more difficult to secure travel authority from higher ups considering that it was 

already consummated. 

 

 

Absence/erroneous accounting entries in DVs 
 

16. In CDO EO, the absence of accounting entries and erroneous recording in the 
DVs and in the Reports of Checks Issued (RCIs) with a total amount of 

₱13,719,668.08 and ₱227,694.98, respectively, contrary to the provisions of 

Sections 111 – 113 of PD No. 1445 and Chapter 3, Volume III of GAM, 

resulted to inaccurate accounting records. 

 

Sections 111 - 113 under Title III, Chapter 2 of PD No. 1445, provides as 

follows: 



81 

 

 

Section 111. Keeping of accounts. The accounts of an agency shall 

be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the 

agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information 

needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. 

 

Section 112. Recording of financial transaction.  Each government 

agency shall record its financial transactions and operations 

conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and in 

accordance with pertinent laws and regulations. 

 

Chapter 3 of GAM, Volume III provides a description of the accounts under 

the RCA for NGAs. 

  

The post-audit of DVs disclosed the following lapses of the agency in terms 

of maintaining accounting data: 

 

a) Most of the DVs submitted by the agency did not contain accounting entries. 

Since DVs are considered as source documents for the preparation of the 

JEVs, the accounting entry section is an essential part of the document.  

 

a) A number of DVs with accounting entries, provided inappropriate accounts 
considering the nature of the transactions and/or provided accounts where the 

Account Titles and UACS Codes did not match.  

 

Validation of the RCIs submitted by the Cashier also revealed that in some 

cases, those transactions that were inappropriately taken up in the DVs were also 

erroneously recorded on the RCIs. 

 

Further, inquiry from the Accountant disclosed that the Bookkeeper, who is 

in-charge of inputting the accounting entries, performs multitasking and is given 

three different functions. He mentioned that the Bookkeeper is not that adept in 

terms of Accounting and initially, didn’t even know that bookkeeping would form 

part of her functions. The Accountant also admitted that although he noticed the 

absence of accounting entries on most DVs, he just disregarded his observation 

since he independently prepares accounting entries on the records. 

 

The lapses noted during audit constitute non-compliance with the provisions 

of Sections 111 – 113 of PD No. 1445 and the GAM. As a result thereof, the 

reliability of the accounting records is questionable in terms of accuracy. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) ensure that the Bookkeeper is given proper orientation, training and 
guidance as to her functions; and 

 



82 

 

b) require the Accountant to closely monitor the works of the Bookkeeper 
and conduct reconciliation between relevant source documents and the 

related records/reports and to establish accuracy of accounting records.

17. Forty-five DVs and supporting documents with a total of ₱4,943,583.20 at the 
CDA Central Office were not submitted to the Audit Team, hence, the 

propriety and regularity of the expenditures covered by these DVs, could not 

be ascertained and likewise contrary to Section 7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 

2009-006 dated September 15, 2009. 
 

Section 7.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 on 

Prescribing Use of the RRSA provides that: 

 

The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official

the Auditor or his authorized representatives when needed; Xxx. 

 

Verification revealed that 45 DVs and its supporting documents with a total 

of ₱4,943,583.20 remained unsubmitted to the Audit Team, thus validity and 

propriety of said documents could not be ascertained, contrary Section 7.2.1 of 

COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009. 

 

Inquiry with the Accounting Division as to the non-submission of the DVs 

and supporting documents explained that they are still completing the attachments 

such as the ORs before submitting to COA. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant of 

the CDA Central Office to submit immediately the DVs and its supporting 

documents to facilitate the timely review and analysis of the accounts, and to 

affirm the reliability of the Management’s assertion on the validity of 

transactions.

or from issuance of Purchase Orders/JOs in violation of the provisions of COA 



83 

 

Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, thus, precluded the audit 

team of timely evaluation as to compliance with the requirements of applicable 

laws, rules and regulations. 

 

COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 provides the following 

regulations:  

 

Sec. 3.1.1 “Within five (5) working days from the execution of a 

contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies 

or instrumentalities, including government-owned and 

controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said 

contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by 

reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of 

the agency concerned.” 

  

 Sec. 3.2.1 “A copy of any purchase order irrespective of 

amount, and each and every supporting document, shall, within 

five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the 

Auditor concerned...”  

 

Sec. 2.1 “This circular shall cover all contracts, purchase 

orders and the like, entered into by any government agency 

irrespective of amount involved.” 

 

The audit disclosed that copies of the contracts, Purchase Orders and JO for 

CY 2020 were not submitted on the prescribe period in accordance with COA 

Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009.  

 

These non-submissions precluded the Audit Team of timely evaluation as to 

compliance with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations, 

completeness of documentary requirements and determination that the contracts 

entered into by the management are not disadvantageous to the government. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Supply and 

other Accountable Officers of Manila and Tuguegarao EOs to submit all 

contracts/Purchase Orders/JOs to the Office of the Auditor not later than five 

working days from issuance of Purchase Orders and perfection of contract 

together with duly accomplished supporting documents for auditorial review

as at December 31, 2020 were not insured with the General Insurance Fund 

(GIF) of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) due to the non-

preparation of the Property Inventory Form as required under RA No. 656 



86 

 

and COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018, thus, posing risks of non-

indemnification of insurable assets in case of loss or damages. 

 

Section 5 of RA No. 656 provides that every government, except a municipal 

government below first class, is hereby required to insure its properties, with the 

fund against any insurable risk herein provided and pay the premiums thereon. 

 

Likewise, COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 is issued to assist 

the implementation of the provisions of RA No. 656, as amended on the insurance 

and bonding risks on insurable government assets and properties with GIF. It is also 

prescribed that all of the Heads of the government agencies shall direct the 

pertinent official under his/her supervision to prepare the Property Inventory Form 

(PIF) listing of all the insurable properties and other assets and submit the 

consolidated PIF to the Supervising Auditor/ Audit Team Leader and the GIF, 

GSIS, not later than April 30, of each year.

          Total 5,548,720.30 2,942,234.87 

 

In our verification, the Property Officer admitted that the PPE of the Agency 

were not yet insured with the GIF of the GSIS due to the non-preparation of the 

RPCPPE and the PIF, a requirement in securing an insurance with the GIF of GSIS.  

 

Failure to secure insurance coverage of the PPE exposed the agency to risk of 

unindemnifiable loss/damage in case of destruction which may be caused by fire, 

earthquake, theft and other fortuitous event. 

 

We reiterated the prior year recommendation and Management agreed 

to require the Inventory Team to prepare the RPCPPE and PIF, and to 

immediately secure insurance coverage from GIF of the GSIS for all its 

insurable properties to ensure recovery of cost in case of loss or damage.
