D. Scope and Objectives of Audit 
 

The audit covered the review of the accounts and operations of the NBDB for the 

year ended December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) ascertain the level of 

assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements;      

(b) determine the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulation; and  

(c) determine the extent of implementations of prior years’ audit recommendations. 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Audit Team rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of the 

presentation of the financial statements of the NBDB for CY 2020. 
 

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

Below are the significant audit observations with the corresponding 

recommendations which are discussed in detail in Part II of this report. 

 

1. Non-adherence of the National Book Development Board (NBDB) to the 
prescribed timelines set forth under Sections 41 and 122 of Presidential Decree 

(PD) No. 1445, The State Audit Code of the Philippines and existing COA rules 

and regulations on the submission of financial statements and other required 

reports precluded the Audit Team from the timely performance of its 

constitutionally-mandated auditorial and reportorial functions. (Observation     

No. 2) 

 

We recommended that Management comply with the prescribed timeline 

outlined in Section 41 of PD No. 1445 and submit the required financial 

statements/reports to the Office of the Auditor within five days from receipt 

of this Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM). 
 



vi 

2. Deficiencies were noted in administering the National Book Development Trust 
Fund (NBDTF) as the interest income earned from the fund amounting to 

P4,809,822.61 remained unutilized at yearend, contrary to Section 3 of RA       

No. 9521 or the NBDTF Act, thereby, failing to attain the purpose for its 

establishment as mandated under the same law. (Observation No. 3) 

 

We reiterated that Management, as Fund Administrator of the NBDTF: 

 

a) ensure the efficient and effective utilization of the Fund so that 
support and promotion of the Filipino authorship are attained;  

 

b) fast-track the issuance of additional policies and guidelines for the 
effective and efficient implementation of the Fund as required under 

Rule IX, Section 1 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR); 

and  
 

c) exert efforts in contracting and completing the Advisory Committee 
members for each category or subject matter of manuscript 

proposals. 

 

3. The incurred Representation Expenses amounting to P98,553.12 are found to be 
doubtful due to: a) invalid receipt issued by the supplier for the purchase of food 

and rental of venue totaling P25,000.00, b) expired Certificate of PhilGEPS 

Registration; and c) lacking supporting documents for the hotel accommodations 

reimbursed by NBDB Board members amounting to P19,680.00, contrary to the 

existing rules and regulations about the said expenditures.  (Observation No. 4) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a) require the suppliers to issue a valid official receipt and updated/current 
Certificate of PhilGEPS Registration; and 

 

b) submit the noted lacking documents to avoid audit suspension. 
 

4. Transparency in governance was not fully assured by the NBDB when the posting 
and updating of the information on donations, trust receipts, public funds, audit, 

financial and physical reports, as well as the required 'Transparency Seal' in its 

official website have not been completely undertaken as mandated under Sections  

89, 90, 91 and 94 of the General Provisions, GAA for FY 2020 or RA No. 11465; 

thus, depriving the public of inclusiveness to the pertinent information necessary 

to enforce accountability among its officials.   

 

Moreover, this also affected the Agency’s eligibility for Performance-Based 

Bonus (PBB) in CY 2020 due to non-compliance with the good governance 

conditions required under Memorandum Circular No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 2020 

issued by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF). (Observation No. 5) 

 



vii 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a) comply strictly with Sections 89, 90, 91, and 94 of the General Provisions 
of the GAA of 2020 or RA No. 11465 and Section 4 of Memorandum 

Circular No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 2020 issued by the IATF on the 

Harmonization of National Government Performance Monitoring, 

Information and Reporting Systems; and 

 

b) ensure that the Agency’s available information technology resources are 

utilized to make certain that the transparency and accountability of its 

operational and financial affairs are strictly implemented. 
 

5. Out of its total budget of P41 million, P4,715,898.78 or 12 percent was not 
obligated, of which P3,984,675.03 or 84 percent pertains to the Maintenance and 

Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) funds intended for the Local Book Publishing 

Industry Development Program and attributable to the unimplemented targeted 

activities brought about by the challenges of the Pandemic, contrary to National 

Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated January 6, 2020. Also, negative actual 

accomplishments were noted in the Budget Accountability Report (BAR) No. 1 - 

Quarterly Physical Report of Operation as at yearend which should have been 

reported as zero.  

 

Moreover, deficiencies amounting to P15,000,000.91 were found in the submitted 

certification for discontinued Programs/Activities/Projects (PAPs) in support of 

the COVID-19-related interventions per NBC No. 580 dated April 22, 2020 vis-à-

vis the Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and 

Balances (SAAODB) – Financial Accountability Report (FAR) No. 1 as of 

December 31, 2020 of the Agency. (Observation No. 6) 

 

We reiterated the following recommendations to Management: 

 

a) properly plan and identify the activities intended to be undertaken during 
the year by providing a more realistic budget estimate for its PAPs, as well 

as improving its budget utilization rate to avoid excess allocation of funds 

assuring, among others, the efficient and effective apportionment of 

government resources; 

  

b) revisit its existing PAPs and adopt measures/activities that will address the 
challenges posed by the COVID-19 Pandemic to ensure the attainment of 

the Local Book Publishing Industry Development Program’s objectives; 

  

c) identify and investigate the cause of the negative amount of P124,176.00 
recorded in the 4th quarter disbursement under the ICT as well as the 

reported negative accomplishments in the submitted BAR No. 1 as of 

yearend and make the necessary corrections; and 

  



viii 

d) explain the deficiencies amounting to P15,000,000.91 found between the 

submitted Certification per NBC 580 and the SAAODB – FAR No. 1 as of 

December 31, 2020. 
 

6. Expenses incurred amounting to P187,371.22 or 59.85 percent of the Traveling 
Expenses – Foreign account totaling P313,053.33 of the NBDB were found to be 

doubtful due to the incomplete submission of supporting documents and 

insufficient proof of payments made contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001 

dated June 14, 2012, and Section 3.8.3 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14 dated 

December 28, 2018. (Observation No. 7) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a) clarify the differences found in the attached Letter of Invitation from the 
London Book Fair and submit authentic copy of the said document or 

provide proof of receipt of the invitation (email threads of its receipt or any 

applicable process); and 

 

b) submit official receipt and proof of payment confirmation from UKVI and 
airfare fees incurred and other lacking documents. 

 

7. The budget allocation of P10,214,437.50 or 19 percent of the adjusted current 
appropriations of the Agency for FY 2020 totaling P53,765,475.00 for its Gender 

and Development (GAD) activities is within the five percent threshold as required 

under Sections 2.3 and 6.1 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 

and Section 31 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA, however, the 

GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) submitted only on March 25, 2021 showed a 

total of nine GAD activities instead of the eight planned and reflected in the GAD 

Plan and Budget (GPB) and out of those nine GAD activities, only one was 

implemented, seven partially done and one not implemented due to the global 

Pandemic with a total disbursements of P633,239.57, which is 6.20 percent of the 

approved GAD budget, contrary to Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 

dated March 18, 2014. (Observation No. 9) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a) explain the difference in the total number of GAD planned activities in 
the GPB and those reported in the GAD AR; and 

 

b) provide the justification for the incurrence of the expenditures above 

the GAD budget in FY 2019 and the non/partial implementation of 

previous year’s three GAD planned activities.  
 

The foregoing audit observations and recommendations were communicated 

through Audit Observation Memoranda. Due to the present situation caused by COVID-

19, the conduct of the exit conference was not feasible. In lieu thereof, we furnished a 

copy of the Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations on the results of 



ix 

audit conducted for the CY 2020 on March 26, 2021. Management comments were 

incorporated in this Annual Audit Report (AAR), where appropriate. 

 

G. Status of Settlement of Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 
 

Audit disallowances totaling P92,400.00 remained unsettled as at the end of the 

year. 
 

H. Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations 
 

Of the seven prior years’ audit recommendations embodied in the CY 2019 AAR 

of the NBDB, three were fully implemented and four were not implemented, the details 

of which are discussed in Part III of this Report.
