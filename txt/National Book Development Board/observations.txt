PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

1. Audit of the National Book Development Board (NBDB) financial statements 
(FSs) disclosed that  the same  were free from any material misstatements and 

are prepared in accordance with the applicable and appropriate financial 

reporting framework of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards 

(IPSAS) with corresponding Philippine Application Guidance (PAG); and thus, 

becomes the basis in rendering an  unqualified audit opinion on the financial 

position of the Agency as at December 31, 2020 and its financial performance, 

cash flows, changes in net assets/equity, comparison of budget and actual 

amounts for the year then ended and notes to financial statements. 

 

 

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 

Delay in Submission of Financial Reports  

 

2. Non-adherence of the NBDB to the prescribed timelines set forth under Sections 
41 and 122 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, The State Audit Code of the 

Philippines and existing COA rules and regulations on the submission of 

financial statements and other required reports precluded the Audit Team from 

the timely performance of its constitutionally-mandated auditorial and 

reportorial functions. 

 

2.1.  Pertinent provisions of PD No. 1445 on the submission of reports by 

government agencies to the Commission on Audit are as follows: 
 

 Section 41. Annual report of the Commission. 
 

“(1) The Commission shall submit to the President, the Prime 

Minister, and the National Assembly not later than the last day of 

September of each year an annual report of the financial condition 

and results of operation of all agencies of the government which shall 

include recommendations of measures necessary to improve the 

efficiency and effectiveness of these agencies. 

 

(2) To carry out the purposes of this section, the chief accountant or 

the official in charge of keeping the accounts of a government agency 

shall submit to the Commission year-end trial balances and such other 

supporting or subsidiary statements as may be required by the 

Commission not later than the fourteenth day of February. Trial 

balances returned by the Commission for revision due to non-

compliance with accounting rules and regulations, shall be 



 
 

37 

 

resubmitted within three days after the date of receipt by the official 

concerned. 

 

(3) Failure on the part of any official or employee to comply with the 

provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph shall cause the 

automatic suspension of the payment of his salary and other 

emoluments until he shall have complied therewith. The violation of 

these provisions for at least three times shall subject the offender to 

administrative disciplinary action.”  

 

 Section 122. Submission of reports.  
 

“Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies of the service, the 

Commission may under regulations issued by it require the agency 

heads, chief officers, and other responsible officials of the various 

agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current 

plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for 

the exercise of its functions. 

 

(2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the 

documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the 

suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have complied 

with the requirements of the Commission.  

 

(3) No appropriation authorized in the General Appropriations Act 

shall be available to pay the salary or any official or employee who 

violates the provisions of this section, without prejudice to any 

disciplinary action that may be instituted against such official or 

employee.” 
 

2.2. Moreover, Section 60, Chapter 19 on Financial Reporting, Volume I of the 

Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for the National Government 

Agencies (NGAs) states that: 

 

“All NGAs shall prepare and submit the following financial 

statements and schedules as follows, within the prescribed deadline: 

 
c. Central/Head/Main Office 

   

Entity/Office Statement/Report Deadline 

Monthly 
Trial Balances (TBs) and 

Supporting Schedules (SSs) 

Ten (10) days after the end of the 

month 

Quarterly TB, FSs, SSs Ten days after the end of the quarter 

Yearend TBs, FS, SSs February 14 of the following year” 

  



 
 

38 

 

2.3.  Quarterly FSs of the Agency for the 3rd and 4th quarters of CY 2020 were 

belatedly submitted to the Audit Team, contrary to the above provision. 

 

2.4.  On the other hand, Section 32 of Chapter 3, Volume I of GAM, which 

prescribes the submission of budget and accountability reports, provides that: 

 

“Section 32. All departments/agencies shall observe the following 

timelines in submitting the required Financial Accountability Reports 

(FARs) to COA-GAS and DBM: 

  

a. Within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter   

 Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, 

Obligations, Disbursements and 

Balances (SAAODB) 

- FAR No. 1

Obligations, Disbursements and 

Balances by Object of Expenditures 

(SAAODBOE)

 Consolidated Statement of Allotments, Obligations, and 

Balances per Summary of Appropriations under For 

Comprehensive Release (FCR) under General Appropriations 

Act, (GAA) General Allotment Release Order (GARO), and 

Special Allotment Release Order (SARO).” 

 

2.5.  The following NBDB FSs/Reports as of December 31, 2020 were requested by 

the Audit Team, in its letter to the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the Agency dated 



 
 

39 

 

January 4, 2021, to be presented and/or submitted to the Audit Team on or 

before February 14, 2021: 

 

a. Statement of Financial Position (Detailed and Condensed); 

b. Statement of Financial Performance (Detailed and Condensed); 

c. Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity; 

d. Cash Flow Statement (Detailed and Condensed); 

e. Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts; 

f. Notes to Financial Statements, comprising a summary of significant 
accounting policies and other explanatory notes;  

g. Pre and Post-closing Trial Balance and other financial reports (i.e., 
Journals, Ledgers, Disbursement Vouchers, Liquidation Reports, etc.); 

h. Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs); and 

i. List of Notice of Cash Allocations (NCAs). 

2.6.  However, the OIC, through a letter dated February 8, 2021, requested for 

extension to submit until March 15, 2021 the FY 2020 FSs/Reports due to the 

recent resignation of the Accountant for health reasons and the assignment of 

an Administrative Assistant III to act as the Senior Bookkeeper with the 

assistance of an Accounting Clerk until the replacement is hired. Moreover, the 

national health emergency caused by COVID-19 has also created significant 

obstacles or limitations from their access to the files/information needed in the 

preparation of the financial reports. 

 

2.7.  In response thereto, the Audit Team denied the request because existing 

regulations on the submission of financial reports to the oversight agencies are 

mandatory, thus, the target dates mentioned therein must be strictly followed. 

 

2.8. The non-submission of the abovementioned financial statements/reports 

hindered the timely audit of the transactions entered into by the Agency and to 

consequently establish their legality, propriety and validity. It caused delay in 

the execution of audit procedures by the Audit Team to ascertain the 

reasonableness of Management’s assertion in the financial statements and its 

conformance with IPSAS with corresponding PAG. 

 

2.9.  We recommended that Management comply with the prescribed timeline 

outlined in Section 41 of PD No. 1445 and existing regulations, and submit 

the required financial statements/reports to the Office of the Auditor 

within five days from receipt of this Audit Observation Memorandum 

(AOM). 

 



 
 

40 

 

2.10.  Management submitted to the Audit Team the required financial statements on 

March   24, 2021. 

 

Non-implementation of the National Book Development Trust Fund (NBDTF) 

 

3. Deficiencies were noted in administering the National Book Development Trust 
Fund (NBDTF) as the interest income earned from the fund amounting to 

P4,809,822.61 remained unutilized at yearend, contrary to Section 3 of Republic 

Act (RA) No. 9521 or the NBDTF Act, thereby, failing to attain the purpose for 

its establishment as mandated under the same law.  
 

3.1.  Section 3 of RA No. 9521 or the NBDTF Act provides the following 

provisions: 
 

   NBDTF is established exclusively for the support and promotion of 

Filipino authorship especially in science and technology and in subject 

areas wherein locally authored books are either few or non-existent. 
 

   Only the interest drawn from the Fund shall be awarded as grants to 
promote Filipino authorship and to support the completion of local 

manuscripts or research works for publication. 

 

   The NBDB shall be the administrator of the Fund. It was further 
expressed under Rule III, Section 4 of the Implementing Rules and 

Regulations (IRR) of the Act that as such, NBDB shall prepare 

guidelines and decision-making mechanisms related to the Fund. 

 

3.2.  Moreover, Rule IX, Section 1 of the IRR declared that the Board may, from 

time to time, promulgate additional issuances, policies and guidelines, for the 

effective implementation of the Fund and its IRR, which shall thereafter form 

an integral part of the IRR. 

 

3.3.  In the awarding of grants to eligible author-grantees of the Trust Fund, an 

Advisory Committee will be organized to evaluate the manuscript proposals per 

designated category or subject matter. The Board (and partner LGU, if 

applicable) shall make public announcements on the deadlines for proposals 

and applications for grants, which may specify the subject areas for a specific 

year available for funding. The Advisory Committees shall evaluate 

applications per category, and recommend to the NBDB Governing Board the 

winning proposals that merit the giving of a grant and the recommended 

amount for approval. The Board shall have the authority to decide with finality 

the grantees in any given year and the specific amounts to be granted upon 

endorsement of the advisory committee concerned. The NBDB shall announce 

the names of the winning applicants and manuscript proposals. 

 



 
 

41 

 

3.4.  Transactions related to the Fund were recorded under Investments in Treasury 

Bonds – Local, Interest Income and Unrealized Gain/(Loss). Post-audit of 

submitted reports and documents related to the Trust Fund issued by the Land 

Bank of the Philippines (LBP) showed that the balances of accounts are the 

same with the balances reported in the year-end financial statements of the 

accounts Investments in Treasury Bonds – Local amounting to 

P141,902,422.11, Unrealized Gain/(Loss) of P4,079,102.23 and the Interest 

Income of P4,809,822.61. 
 

3.5.  Non-utilization of the Interest Income intended to support and promote Filipino 

authorship was again noted in the current year. The non-implementation of the 

NBDTF and non-issuance of awards in the previous year were also 

communicated to the Agency through an AOM. It has been two consecutive 

years that the non-awarding of grants to the intended grantees was observed. Per 

submitted Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation (AAPSI) as of 

July 31, 2020, initial discussions were made during the 261st Regular Board 

Meeting of the NBDB on the issuance of additional policies and guidelines for 

the effective and efficient implementation of the Fund required under Rule IX, 

Section 1 of the IRR, as previously recommended by the Audit Team. The 

Agency was also advised to exert efforts in contracting and completing the 

Advisory Committee members for each category which was identified as a 

problem last year. It was reported that all prospective committee members have 

submitted their acceptance, and that the Board has yet to finalize its assignments 

of chairing each committee. 

  

3.6.  The above-noted shortcomings adversely affect the attainment of the purpose in 

the establishment of the NBDTF as mandated under RA No. 9521. Available 

funds in support of the eligible Filipino authors remained unutilized in the 

current year. 

 

3.7.  We reiterated that Management, as Fund Administrator of the NBDTF: 

 

a) ensure the efficient and effective utilization of the Fund so that support 
and promotion of the Filipino authorship are attained; 

 

b) fast-track the issuance of additional policies and guidelines for the 
effective and efficient implementation of the Fund as required under 

Rule IX, Section 1 of the IRR; and 

 

c) exert efforts in contracting and completing the Advisory Committee 
members for each category or subject matter of manuscript proposals. 

  

3.8.  Management commented that they are finalizing the updated guidelines and that 

it is expected to complete the evaluation processes this year. Part of the 

strategies being developed for CY 2021 is streamlining the NBDTF 

interoperability with other existing programs of NBDB. In this way, program 



 
 

42 

 

complementation will be in place and they see greater reach in terms of 

promotion of Filipino authorship. Additional guidelines are also now being 

implemented. Among these is the organizational restructuring to address the 

workforce support to the NBDTF as communicated to the Audit Team on 

November 26, 2020. The NBDB Governing Board approved on its 262nd 

Regular Board Meeting (January 19, 2021) the full composition Advisory 

Committee. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

3.9.  The AAPSI submitted by the Agency on November 26, 2020 only indicated 

that initial discussions were made during the 261st Regular Board Meeting of 

the NBDB for the previous year’s recommendation on issuance of additional 

policies and guidelines for the effective and efficient implementation of the 

Fund. 

 

Doubtful Representation Expenses 

 

4. The incurred Representation Expenses amounting to P98,553.12 are found to be 
doubtful due to: a) invalid receipt issued by the supplier for the purchase of food 

and rental of venue totaling P25,000.00, b) expired Certificate of Philippine 

Government Electronic Procurement System (PhilGEPS) Registration; and       

c) lacking supporting documents for the hotel accommodations reimbursed by 

NBDB Board members amounting to P19,680.00, contrary to the existing rules 

and regulations about the said expenditures.  
 

4.1.  In preparing the FSs, Management is making implicit or explicit claims (i.e., 

assertions) regarding the recognition, measurement and presentation of assets, 

liabilities, equity, income, expenses and disclosures in accordance with the 

applicable financial reporting framework, or the IPSAS with corresponding 

PAG. 

 

4.2.  Among the Management’s assertions are the completeness and accuracy 

assertions.  The completeness assertion addresses whether all transactions that 

were supposed to be recorded have been recognized in the financial statements, 

while the accuracy assertion addresses whether all transactions that should be 

included in the financial statements at appropriate amounts have been included. 

 

a) Invalid receipt for the purchase of food and rental of venue totaling 
P25,000.00 

 

4.3.  The 254th NBDB Regular Board Meeting on March 3, 2020 was held at the 

Rizal Park Hotel. Post-audit of the transaction revealed that the attached 

documentation was a form with “not a valid Official Receipt (OR)” appearing 

in the face of the document, contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 



 
 

43 

 

14, 2012 and Section 3.8.3 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14 dated 

December 28, 2018, which provides the following provisions: 

 

No. 5 on the General Requirements for All Types of Disbursement under COA 

Circular 2012-001 – “Sufficient and relevant documents to establish validity of 

claim.” 

 

Section 3.8.3 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14 – “Non-issuance of OR or 

Sales Invoice by the contractor/supplier shall be reported to the BIR as 

violation of regulations.” 

 

4.4. The same hotel was able to issue an OR for the hotel accommodation of the 

NBDB Board members who stayed there on March 2-4, 2020 for the said Board 

Meeting. 

 

b) Expired Certificate of PhilGEPS Registration 
 

4.5.  Section 8.5.2 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 states that: 
 

All bidders shall upload and maintain in PhilGEPS a current and updated file 

of the following Class “A” eligibility documents under Sections 23.1(a) and 

24.1(a): 

 

a) Registration Certificate; 
b) Mayor’s/Business Permit or its Equivalent Document; 
c) Tax Clearance; 
d) Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB) license and 

registration; and 

e) Audited Financial Statements. 
 

4.6.  A special meeting was held at BGISIS Development Corporation/Luxent on 

January 28-29, 2020. However, the attached Certificate of PhilGEPS 

Registration of the said hotel was valid until October 25, 2019 only, contrary to 

the above provision. 

 

c) Lacking supporting documents for the hotel accommodations reimbursed by 
NBDB Board members amounting to P19,680.00 

 

4.7.  The Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) Resolution for the awarding of 

contract, Abstract of Quotations and Proof of Quotations sent by the bidders 
were not attached as supporting documents for the reimbursements totaling 

P19,680.00 on accommodation at the Rizal Park Hotel of the NBDB Board 

members held on March 2-4,2020 as follows:

4.8.  We recommended that Management: 

 

a) require the suppliers to issue a valid OR and updated/current 
Certificate of PhilGEPS Registration; and 

 

b) submit the noted lacking documents to avoid audit suspension. 
 

4.9.  Management submitted the scanned copy of the OR for the purchase of food 

and rental of venue and screenshot of the Certification of PhilGEPS 

Registration of BGISIS Development Corporation/Luxent issued on September 

22, 2020 valid until September 22, 2021. Also, the expenses incurred for the 

hotel accommodation of the Governing Board members to travel expense 

account were adjusted. Sec. 7 of RA No. 8047 entitles the board to such other 

allowances for actual meetings attended and the incurrence of travel related 

expenditure (hotel accommodation) was certified by the NBDB Chair Dante 

Francis Ang as to the necessity pursuant to Sec. 5D of Executive Order (EO) 

No. 77. 

 

Non-compliance with Transparency and Accountability in Government Operations 

Utilizing Information Technology 

 

5. Transparency in governance was not fully assured by the NBDB when the 
posting and updating of the information on donations, trust receipts, public 

funds, audit, financial and physical reports, as well as the required 

‘Transparency Seal’ in its official website have not been completely undertaken 

as mandated under Sections  89, 90, 91 and 94 of the General Provisions (GP), 

GAA for FY 2020 or RA No. 11465; thus, depriving the public of inclusiveness to 

the pertinent information necessary to enforce accountability among its officials.   

 

Moreover, this also affected the Agency’s eligibility for Performance-Based 

Bonus (PBB) in CY 2020 due to non-compliance with the good governance 

conditions required under Memorandum Circular No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 

2020 issued by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF).  
 



 
 

45 

 

5.1.  Applicable provisions in the GAA of FY 2020 or RA No. 11465 to enhance 

transparency and accountability in the government are the following: 
 

 Section 89. Report on Commission on Audit Findings and 
Recommendations  

 

“Within sixty (60) days from receipt of the COA Annual Audit 

Report, agencies concerned shall submit to the COA, either in printed 

form or by way of electronic document, a status report on the actions 

taken on said audit findings and recommendations using the 

prescribed form under COA Memorandum No. 2014-002 dated 

March 18, 2014. They shall likewise furnish the DBM, the speaker of 

the House of Representatives, the President of the Senate of the 

Philippines, the House Committee on Appropriations, and the Senate 

Committee on Finance, either in printed form or by way of electronic 

document, a copy of said reports. 

 

The heads of agencies and the agencies’ web administrator or their 

equivalent shall be responsible for ensuring that said monthly reports 

are likewise posted in their respective websites.” 

 

 Section 90. Financial Reports  
 

“On or before the tenth (10th) day of the month immediately 

following the covered period, departments, bureaus, offices and 

instrumentalities of the National Government, including 

Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs, shall 

submit the monthly report on appropriations, allotments, obligations 

and disbursements of current appropriations, as well as the monthly 

report of disbursement, through the following: a) URS or other 

electronic means for reports not covered by the URS; and b) Agency’s 

website. 

 

The agency shall send written notice when said reports have been 

submitted or posted on its website to the DBM, House of 

Representatives, Senate of the Philippines, House Committee on 

Appropriations, and the Senate Committee on Finance, and other 

offices where the submission of reports is required under existing 

laws, rules, and regulations. The date of notice to said agencies shall 

be considered the date of compliance with this requirement.” 

 

 Section 91.  Financial and Physical Reports 
 

“Within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter, departments, 

bureaus, offices and instrumentalities of the National Government, 

including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs, 



 
 

46 

 

shall submit the quarterly reports on its financial and physical 

accomplishments as well as reports and other information mandated 

in the special and general provisions of this Act, through the 

following: a) URS or other electronic means for reports not covered 

by the URS; and b) Agency’s website. 

 

The agency shall send written notice when said reports have been 

submitted or posted on its website to the DBM, House of 

Representatives, Senate of the Philippines, House Committee on 

Appropriations, and the Senate Committee on Finance, and other 

offices where the submission of reports is required under existing 

laws, rules, and regulations. The date of notice to said agencies shall 

be considered the date of compliance with this requirement. 

Failure to comply with any of the foregoing shall result in the 

automatic suspension of the salaries of the responsible official or 

employee until they have complied with the above requirements 

pursuant to Section 57, Chapter 6, Book VI of EO No. 292. 

 

Repeated failure or refusal of said official and employee to submit the 

above reports or to post the reports on the Agency’s official website 

without any justifiable cause may be a ground for administrative 

disciplinary action, subject to pertinent civil service rules and 

regulations. The head of agency shall be responsible for ensuring 

compliance with this penalty provision.” 

 

 Section 94. Transparency Seal  
 

“To enhance transparency and enforce accountability, all agencies of 

the government shall maintain a Transparency Seal to be posted on 

their websites. The Transparency Seal shall contain the following 

information: (i) the agency’s mandates and functions, names of its 

officials with their position and designation, and contact information; 

(ii) approved budgets and corresponding targets, immediately upon 

approval of this Act; (iii) modifications made pursuant to the general 

and special provisions in this Act; (iv) annual procurement plan/s and 

contracts awarded with the winning supplier, contractor or 

consultant; (v) major activities or projects categorized in accordance 

with the 0+10 point socio economic agenda and their target 

beneficiaries;   (vi) status of implementation, evaluation or 

assessment reports of said programs or projects; (vii) Budget and 

Financial Accountability Reports; (viii) People’s Freedom of 

Information (FOI) Manual signed  by head of agency, Agency 

Information Inventory, 2018 and 2019 FOI Summary Report, and 

2018 and 2019 FOI Registry; and (ix) annual reports on the status of 

income authorized by law to be retained and/or used and be deposited 

outside of the National Treasury, which shall include the legal basis 



 
 

47 

 

for its retention and/or use, the beginning balance, income collected 

and its sources, expenditures, and ending balance for the preceding 

fiscal year. 

 

The heads of the agencies and their web administrators or their 

equivalent shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with this 

section.” 

 

5.2.  Further, Section 4 of Memorandum Circular (M.C.) No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 

2020 issued by IATF on the Harmonization of National Government 

Performance Monitoring, Information and Reporting Systems on Guidelines on 

the Grant of the PBB for Fiscal Year 2020 under EO No. 80 s. 2012 and EO 

No. 201 s. 2016, likewise provides the Good Governance Conditions (GGCs) 

based on performance drivers of the Results-Based Performance Management 

System (RBPMS) and the priorities of the Duterte Administration for 1) 

heightened transparency; 2) stronger public accountability; and 3) more 

inclusive and people-centered public service, as one of the conditions to be 

eligible for the grant of PBB. Among these is the maintenance/update of the 

agency Transparency Seal (TS) under Section 94 of the General Provisions of 

the FY 2020 GAA. 

 

5.3.  Ideally, the Transparency Seal summarizes all the needed data in the nine 

identified components as prescribed in the current budget act. It is depicted by a 

pearl shining out of an open shell, which is a symbol of a policy shift towards 

openness in access to government information. It hopes to inspire Filipinos in 

the civil service to be more open to citizen engagement; on the other hand, it 

invites the citizenry to exercise their right to participate in governance. This 

initiative is envisioned as a step in the right direction towards solidifying the 

position of the country as a shining example for democratic virtue in the region. 

 

5.4.  Validation of the Agency’s official website at https://booksphilippines.gov.ph 

showed that the following requirements mandated under Sections 89, 90, 91 

and 94 of the GP, GAA for FY 2020 or RA No. 11465 are not/partially 

complied with by the NBDB, as follows:

5.5.  The Management’s failure to fully utilize its official website to disclose to the 

public all the vital information enumerated above is a glaring setback in 

adopting measures to ensure transparency and accountability which is required 

from the Agency, as one of the budgetary reforms being undertaken to 

encourage good governance among the different branches of government. 

 

5.6.  Similarly, the need to employ these available digital platforms is more fitting 

nowadays due to the challenges brought about by the Pandemic, where 

restriction of movement is imposed across the country.   Making use of the 

advances provided by this website to communicate the important information is 

now the new norm that is unparalleled and paramount under these 

circumstances. 

 

5.7.  Furthermore, these deficiencies also affected the Agency’s eligibility for PBB 

in CY 2020 due to non-compliance with good governance conditions required 

under MC No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 2020 issued by the IATF on the 

Harmonization of National Government Performance Monitoring, Information, 

and Reporting Systems. 

 

5.8.  We recommended that Management: 

 

a) comply strictly with Sections 89, 90, 91, and 94 of the General 
Provisions of the GAA of 2020 or RA No. 11465 and Section 4 of 

Memorandum Circular No. 2020-1 dated June 2, 2020 issued by the 

IATF on the Harmonization of National Government Performance 

Monitoring, Information and Reporting Systems; and 

 



 
 

50 

 

b) ensure that the Agency’s available information technology resources 
are utilized to make certain that the transparency and accountability 

of its operational and financial affairs are strictly implemented. 

 

5.9.  Management commented that the updating of their website under the 

Transparency Seal is now being attended to and that they will closely monitor 

this from now on. 

 

Deficient Budget Utilization 

 

6. Out of its total budget of P41 million, P4,715,898.78 or 12 percent was not 
obligated, of which P3,984,675.03 or 84 percent pertains to the Maintenance 

and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) funds intended for the Local Book 

Publishing Industry Development Program and attributable to the 

unimplemented targeted activities brought about by the challenges of the 

Pandemic, contrary to National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated January 

6, 2020. Also, negative actual accomplishments were noted in the Budget 

Accountability Report (BAR) No. 1 - Quarterly Physical Report of Operation as 

at yearend which should have been reported as zero.  
 

Moreover, deficiencies amounting to P15,000,000.91 were found in the 

submitted certification for discontinued Programs/Activities/Projects (PAPs) in 

support of the COVID-19-related interventions per NBC No. 580 dated April 

22, 2020 vis-à-vis the SAAODB –FAR No. 1 as of December 31, 2020 of the 

Agency.  
 

6.1.  Certain provisions under NBC No. 578 dated January 6, 2020 are as follows: 

 

"3.4 With the adoption of the Cash Budgeting System (CBS) and 

consistent with Section 60, GPs of the FY 2020 GAA, all 

appropriations authorized under the FY 2020 GAA, including 

budgetary support to GOCCs and SAGF, shall be available for 

release and disbursement for the purpose specified, and under the 

same General and Special Provisions of said GAA applicable thereto 

until December 31, 2020. 

 

3.4.5 After the end of validity period, all unreleased appropriations or 

unexpended or undisbursed funds shall revert to the unappropriated 

surplus of the General Fund, in accordance with Section 28, Chapter 

4, Book VI of E.O. 292 and shall not be available for expenditure 

except by subsequent legislative enactment. 

 

3.5 Pursuant to RA No. 11464, An Act Extending the Availability of 

the FY 2019 Appropriations to December 31, 2020, amending for the 

Purpose Section 65 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11260, the 

General Appropriations Act of the Fiscal Year 2019, the guidelines 

prescribed under item 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 hereof shall apply. 



 
 

51 

 

Relative thereto, unreleased appropriations as well as unobligated 

allotments for Personnel Services chargeable against the continuing 

FY 2019 GAA, shall be valid for release, obligation and/or 

disbursements, as applicable, up to December 31, 2020 only.” 

 

6.2.  Review of the SAAODB – FAR No. 1 for CY 2020 of the NBDB showed a 

total allotment of P41,019,411.17, of which P36,303,512.39 was obligated. The 

status of fund utilization by allotment class, percentage of the Unobligated 

Allotment by Allotment Class and the status of the Fund Utilizations by

6.3.  The details of the unobligated allotment of P4,715,898.78 in CY 2020 primarily 

pertains to the Agency’s MOOE amounting to P3,984,675.03, which is 

attributed mainly to Traveling Expenses, Training Expenses, Supplies and 

Materials Expenses, Professional Services and Other MOOE for the 

implementation of the Local Book Publishing Industry Development Program. 

The unobligated amount of the Personnel Services (PS) of P688,943.95 is 



 
 

52 

 

composed of Clothing/Uniform Allowance, Productivity Enhancement 

Incentive (PEI), Mid-Year Bonus, Employees Compensation Insurance 

Premiums (ECIP), Retirement and Life Insurance Premiums (RLIP) and 

Miscellaneous Personnel Benefits Fund (MPBF). The P42,279.80 of 

unobligated Capital Outlays (CO) pertains to the budget intended for 

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Equipment. 

 

6.4.  Furthermore, review of the BAR No. 1 - Quarterly Physical Report of 

Operation as of December 31, 2020 of the Agency, which was just submitted on 

March 12, 2021, revealed its unimplemented targets for the year due to the 

challenges brought about by the global Pandemic and negative figures under 

actual accomplishments were noted which should have been reflected as zero if 

targets were not attained and there were no accomplishments to be reported 

during the year, as shown below: 

 

Programs/Projects/Activities Targets 
Actual 

Accomplishments 
Percentage Remarks 

Outcome Indicators   

1.       Percentage increase in 

the number of 

manuscripts/titles by NBDB-

registered authors/publishers 

5 7 140 NBDB gathers its data on the number of manuscripts/titles 

from the registrant's submission. In 2020, although there is 

a decline in the number of individual registrants for 

new/renewal application, NBDB was able to gather 

information from stakeholders whose registration was 

approved in 2019 and is valid until 2020. The consolidated 

manuscripts/titles produced by all active stakeholders 

resulted to a 7% increase from the NBDB 2018 

accomplishment. 

2.       Percentage increase in 

the number of titles published 

by NBDB-registered 

authors/publishers 

2 -21 -1,050 NBDB gathers its data on the number of published titles in 

a year from the registrants' submission of their published 

works. Due to the pandemic, there is a decrease in the 

number of registrants who filed for new/renewal 

application. The agency was not able to acquire 

information on possible publications from stakeholders 

who were not able to register in 2020. 

 

NBDB , during the ECQ period from March to May 2020, 

extended the validity registration for individuals and 

enterprises whose Certificates of Registration's expiration 

were to fall on those months. The registration process was 

also modified to conform to the new normal to ensure the 

safety of the staff and stakeholders as well as to maintain 

the minimum number of processing days for the 

transaction. Even with these efforts, there were still a 

decrease in  registrants in 2020. 

 

In addition, there were also some enterprises who were not 

able to publish books due to the lack of clients/buyers. The 

use of SLMs for basic education is another factor in the 

decrease of textbook publication. 

3.       Percentage increase in 

the gross revenue of NBDB-

registered publishers 

5 -20 -400 NBDB gathers its data on the publishing revenue in a year 

from the registrants' submissions. Due to the pandemic, 

there is a decrease in the number of registrants who filed 

for new/renewal application. The agency was not able to 

acquire infornation on possible publishing revenue of 

stakeholders who were not able to registetr in 2020. 

 

Because of the global health crisis, book revenue were 

negatively affected as book sales declined for some 

stakeholders who experienced lack/decrease of 

clients/buyers for their books. 

 

In addition to this, only 32% of the enterprises (52 out of 



 
 

53 

 

Programs/Projects/Activities Targets 
Actual

Percentage Remarks 

152) submitted revenue reports specific to book 

publishing. 

Output Indicators    

1.       Number of capacity-

building and trade promotion  

28 24 86 The deficient was caused by the cancellation and 

postponement of some NBDB-organized and NBDB-

supported activities as a result of the pandemic. Some of 

these activities were the attendance to the International 

Book Fair in London and Bologna and some regional 

Booklatan sa Bayan training workshop. 

 

Since travel and mass gatherings were prohibited last year, 

NBDB shifted the implementation of its activities to 

online in order to continue delivering services to the 

stakeholders as it is mandated to do. 

2.       Number of awards, 

grants and incentives given 

initiatives undertaken  

35 11 31 A deficit of 24 physical acoomplishments. This is due to 

the postponement of NBA to 2021. NCBA and NBDTF 

are not yet completed as of December 2020.  

 

NBA 

The National Book Awards was postponed to 2021 due to 

the global pandemic. This measure was taken for the 

safety of the staff, nominees, awardees and the judges. The 

postponement was approved by the NBDB Governing 

Board as well as by the Manila Critics Circle (NBDB) 

partner in NBA). 

 

Budget for the awards was given to the COVID-19 IATF 

through DBM for the government's response to the 

pandemic. 

 

NCBA 

The preparatory activities as well as the nomination and 

selection of winners were completed in 2020. However, 

the actual accouncement and awarding of winners is 

scheduled in 2021. 

 

The delay in the preparation and implementation of the 

NCBA was due to the global pandemic. Because of the 

imposed quarantine in the country, project implementers 

need to revisit the project plans and timeline to make 

adjustments that would ensure the safety of all 

agencies/individuals involved. The possible delay in the 

completion of tasks/processes/outputs in the preparation 

and implementation stage was taken into consideration; 

hence, the rescheduling of the awarding. 

 

NBDTF 

Preparatory activities and the submission of applications 

were completed in 2020. Committee members for each 

category is for finalization. After the committees are 

completed, selection of grantees will commence. The 

NBDTF grant is expected to be awarded in the 1st quarter 

of 2021. 

3.       Number of policies 

developed, researches 

conducted, information 

systems developed and/or 

managed, and information 

campaigns conducted 

12 17 142 Exceeded 5 physical targets. This was due to the various 

Industry Research activities such as online surveys and 

consultative meetings that required no expenses and 

implemented online. 

 

Due to the pandemic, there is a need for a comprehensive 

industry research in order for the agency to address issues 

as well as to provide assistance to its stakeholders that are 

tailor-fitted to their needs. 

 

6.5.  As can be gleaned from the table above, the COVID-19 Pandemic had hugely 

affected the implementation of the targeted PPAs of the Agency especially the 

conduct of capacity-building and trade promotion and providing of awards, 



 
 

54 

 

grants, and incentives to local authors as face-to-face activities were strictly 

prohibited pursuant to the safety protocols/rules implemented by the national 

and local governments. 

 

6.6.  In addition, adjustments were made on the authorized appropriations of the 

Agency due to the issued NBC No. 580 dated April 22, 2020 on the Adoption 

of Economy Measures in the Government Due to the Emergency Health 

Situation. Section 4.5 of this Circular stipulates that: 

 

“4.5 Each NGA/SUC/GOCC shall identify and compute their FYs 

2019 and 2020 unobligated allotments for MOOE and CO as of 

March 31, 2020, based on item 4.3 of this Circular. The Certification 

signed by the Head of Agency, duly certified by the authorized budget 

and finance officers concerned, shall include the specific source 

P/A/Ps covering the released amount/s, as well as the corresponding 

amount to be offered. Said certification shall be submitted to the DBM 

not later than April 30, 2020.” 

 

6.7.  NBDB submitted the required Certification in compliance with the above cited 

Circular. Verification of the figures presented in the required Certification vis-

à-vis the submitted SAAODB-FAR No. 1 as of December 31, 2020 revealed 

variances in the total amount of P15,000,000.91, details below:

6.8.  The available budgetary reports indicates that the expenses incurred for the 

above-listed Programs/Activities/Projects (PAPs) were lower than the 

allotments received, thus represents the highest percentage of unutilized MOOE 

funds and a continuous overestimation of the funding requirements for the 

Agency’s PAPs adversely affecting its budget levels and realization of its 

program objectives. 

 

6.9. We reiterated the following recommendations to Management: 

 

a) properly plan and identify the activities intended to be undertaken 
during the year by providing a more realistic budget estimate for its 

PAPs, as well as improving its budget utilization rate to avoid excess 



 
 

55 

 

allocation of funds assuring, among others, the efficient and effective 

apportionment of government resources; 

  

b) revisit its existing PAPs and adopt measures/activities that will address 
the challenges posed by the COVID-19 Pandemic to ensure the 

attainment of the Local Book Publishing Industry Development 

Program’s objectives; 

  

c) identify and investigate the cause of the negative amount of P124,176.00 
recorded in the 4th quarter disbursement under the ICT as well as the 

reported negative accomplishments in the submitted BAR No. 1 as of 

yearend and make the necessary corrections; and 

  

d) explain the deficiencies amounting to P15,000,000.91 found between the 
submitted Certification per NBC No. 580 and the SAAODB – FAR No. 

1 as of December 31, 2020. 

 

6.10.Management commented that they are now rearranging a few positions and 

responsibilities or a major repositioning of some divisions, along with changes 

to their operating units, processes, and position responsibilities. They have also 

considered the current health situation for their 2021 activities. 

 

6.11.Moreover, the P15 million was the amount offered to the IATF for the COVID-

19, which was communicated by the DBM. NBDB offered the unreleased 

appropriation of P10 million for the London Book Fair and P5 million for the 

Bologna Book Fair which were cancelled because of the COVID-19 Pandemic. 

On the other hand, the negative amount of P124,176.00 recorded in the 4th 

quarter disbursement under the ICT was a check issued to DBM-PS which 

became stale because of the unavailability/undelivered laptops. 

 

6.12.The unobligated released allotment in FY 2020 as explained by the 

Management was mostly based on the savings from activities/expenses and 

limitations due to online conduct of PPAs and alternative work arrangement of 

NBDB officials and employees. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

6.13.The revised BAR No. 1 was not yet submitted by the Management.

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

9. The budget allocation of P10,214,437.50 or 19 percent of the adjusted current 
appropriations of the Agency for FY 2020 totaling P53,765,475.00 for its GAD 

activities is within the five percent threshold as required under Sections 2.3 and 

6.1 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 and Section 31 of the 

General Provisions of the FY 2020 General Appropriations Act (GAA), however, 

the GAD Accomplishment Report submitted only on March 25, 2021 showed a 

total of nine GAD activities instead of the eight planned and reflected in the 

GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and out of those nine GAD activities, only one was 

implemented, seven partially done and one not implemented due to the global 

Pandemic with a total disbursements of P633,239.57, which is 6.20 percent of the 

approved GAD budget, contrary to Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 

dated March 18, 2014. 

 

9.1 Sections 2.3 and 6.1 of the PCW-NEDA- DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 or 
the Guidelines for the Preparation of Annual Gender and Development (GAD) 

Plans and Budgets and Accomplishment Reports to Implement the Magna Carta 

of Women provided the following provisions: 

 

“Section 2.3. Pursuant to the MCW and the General Appropriations 

Act (GAA), all government departments, including their attached 

agencies, offices, bureaus, state universities and colleges (SUCs), 

government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs), local 

government units (LGUs) and other government instrumentalities shall 

formulate their annual GPBs within the context of their mandates to 

mainstream gender perspectives in their policies, programs and 

projects. GAD Planning shall be integrated in the regular activities of 

the agencies, the cost of implementation of which shall be at least five 

percent (5%) of their total budgets. The computation and utilization 

shall be implemented in accordance with the specific guidelines 

provided therein. 

 

Section 6.1. At least five percent (5%) of the total agency budget 

appropriations authorized under the annual GAA shall correspond to 

activities supporting GAD plans and programs. The GAD budget shall 

be drawn from the agency’s maintenance and other operating 

expenses (MOOE), capital outlay (CO), and personal services (PS). It 

is understood that the GAD budget does not constitute an additional 

budget over an agency’s total budget appropriations.” 

 

9.2 Likewise, Section 31 of the General Provisions of the GAA for the Fiscal Year 
(FY) 2020 states that: 

 

“All agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and 

Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within 



 
 

60 

 

their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable 

provisions under RA No. 9710 or Magna Carta of Women, Convention 

on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination against women, the 

Beijing Platform for action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-

Responsiveness (1995-2025), and the Philippine Development Plan 

(2017-2022). 

 

The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 

agencies, which shall at least be five percent (5%) of their budgets.  

For this purpose, activity currently being undertaken by agencies 

which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, 

economic empowerment, especially of marginalized women, 

protection, promotion and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and 

practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient 

compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD Budget shall 

be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by 

said agencies. 

 

The preparation and submission of the annual GAD Plan and annual 

GAD Accomplishment Report shall be subject to the guidelines issued 

by the agencies concerned.” 

 

9.3 For FY 2020, NBDB had allocated P10,214,437.50 or 19 percent of the 
adjusted current appropriations of the Agency for the year totaling 

P53,765,475.00 for its GAD activities, which was within the five percent 

threshold. 

 

9.4 The evaluation of the approved GPB for the year covering programs/activities 
categorized as “Client-Focused” and “Organization-Focused” showed that the 

Agency has formulated eight GAD-related activities to be implemented for the 

whole year, details are as follows:

the GAD budget in FY 2019 and the non/partial implementation of 

previous year’s three GAD planned activities.
