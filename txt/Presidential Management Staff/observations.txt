OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Financial Audit 
 

Non-accrual of expenses 

 

1. Expenses for utilities, electricity, salaries and communication incurred in prior 
year totaling ₱1,549,668.32 were recognized as expenses for CY 2020 contrary 

to the accrual basis of accounting, as prescribed under Chapter 2, Volume I of 

the GAM, resulting in the overstatement of related expenses in the financial 

statements at year end.  

 

Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM provides that one of the basic 

standards/fundamental accounting principles for financial reporting by national 

government agencies is the accrual basis, which is defined under Section 2.a as 

follows: 

 

Accrual basis – means a basis of accounting under which transactions 

and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when 

cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions 

and events are recognized in the accounting records and recognized in 

the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. xxx 

 

Section 6.b further provides that each entity shall recognize and present its 

financial transactions and operations conformably to the accrual basis of accounting 

in accordance with the IPSAS. 

 

Post audit of the disbursement vouchers (DVs) for the year disclosed that 

expenses of previous year totaling ₱1,549,668.32 were recognized in the books of 

accounts of the current year, contrary to the accrual basis of accounting, to wit: 

 

Account Particulars Amount (₱) 

Traveling Expenses Plane fares  for November to December  

2019 

930,363.03 

Electricity Expenses Electricity for December 2019 244,336.32 

Communication 

Expenses – Internet 

Globe bill for December 2019  213,053.56 

Water Expenses Water consumption for December 2019 131,465.41 

Other Professional 

Expenses 

Salaries for services rendered for 

December 2019 

30,450.00 

    Total 1,549,668.32 

 

The above transactions consequently resulted in the overstatement of expenses 

for the current period.  

 



37 

 

Management claimed that no billings/invoices/statement of accounts relating 

to the above expenses were presented during the previous year; hence, the same 

were not recognized in that year. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief 

Accountant to prepare adjusting entries to correct the affected accounts, and 

henceforth, to strictly conform to the accrual basis of accounting in accordance 

with the IPSAS. 

 

 

Unserviceable PPE not reported in IIRUP  
 

2. Various idle, fully depreciated and unserviceable PPE with a carrying amount 
of ₱426,312.28 were kept only in storage for further deterioration and not 

reported in the IIRUP as basis for dropping from the PPE accounts and for 

eventual disposal consistent with Section 40, Chapter 10, Volume I of the 

GAM.  

 

Section 40, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM provides that PPE is said to be 

unserviceable if it is no longer capable of providing the entity with future economic 

benefits or service potential.  It also provides that all unserviceable PPE shall be 

reported in the IIRUP, and which shall be dropped from the books by debiting 

Impairment Loss-PPE less Accumulated Depreciation. 

 

In addition, Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides that when a government 

property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it may be 

destroyed or sold at public auction to the highest bidder. 

 

Further, the Manual on Disposal of Government Property embodied in NBC 

No. 425 dated January 28, 1992 was issued to guide agencies in their disposal 

undertakings. Part I (A) thereof provides, among others, that disposal occurs when a 

piece of equipment or property can no longer provide efficient service or, though 

still working, has been rendered useless due to obsolescence. Disposal proceedings 

should be immediately initiated to avoid further deterioration of the property and 

the consequent depreciation in its value. A systematic and timely disposal will yield 

benefits in terms of a higher appraised value/selling price and enabling storage 

areas available for other purposes. 

 

The Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) included various 

unserviceable and fully depreciated properties with a total carrying amount of 

₱426,312.28, with the following details:

          Total 6,277,219.29 5,850,907.01 426,312.28 

 

The bulk of these unserviceable PPEs are stored in two storage facilities 

located at Philippine Ports Authority in Intramuros, Manila and at the PMS office in 

Quezon City, which upon inspection by the Audit Team confirmed that the above 

PPE were indeed unserviceable.  However, no IIRUP has been prepared; thus, these 

unserviceable properties have not been dropped from the books, contrary to 

Sections 40 (d), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM. 

 

It would have been beneficial for PMS had it immediately disposed these 

unserviceable PPE; thus, would have avoided further deterioration of the property 

and the consequent depreciation in its value. A systematic and timely disposal will 

yield benefits in terms of a higher appraised value and enabling storage areas 

available for other purposes.   

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the: 

 

a) Property Unit to expedite the inventory and inspection of all 
unserviceable assets, prepare the IIRUP, and submit it to the agency’s 

Disposal Committee for the immediate disposal of the unserviceable 

equipment; and 

 

b) Chief Accountant, upon receipt of the IIRUP, to prepare a JEV to 
recognize the impairment loss of the unserviceable properties. 

 

Management commented that it is currently conducting inspection and 

assessment of PPEs, to include also those that are no longer needed by the PMS as a 

consequence of their return to the newly retrofitted PMS building.  The target 

period of disposal is within the first semester of 2021. 

 

 

B. Compliance Audit 
 

Non-submission of a monitoring report 

 

3. The absence of a monitoring report on the status of assistance extended to 
battle/duty casualties and their families impacts on the guidance of the Office of the 

President’s implementation of the Socio-Civic Projects Funds (SCPF) to provide 



39 

 

the financial assistance and support urgently needed by the beneficiaries of the 

uniformed personnel who were either killed or wounded in action as offices 

responsible failed to properly coordinate in accordance with their respective 

functions as provided for in the Office Order No. 2017-035 dated March 21, 2017. 

The PMS is the primary government agency responsible for 

providing technical assistance and advice to the President in exercising 

overall management of the development process. The Socio-Civic Projects Funds 

(SCPF) is a special funding facility through which the President provides direct 

assistance to social development-oriented priority projects, particularly those that 

serve very poor communities including underprivileged groups with special needs, 

for which the regular and institutionalized programs of government assistance are 

not sufficiently funded under the regular budget.  One of the projects being 

financed by the SCPF is the Special Financial Assistance (SFA) for Uniformed 

Personnel, for the Killed in Action (KIA) and Wounded in Action (WIA) 

amounting to ₱500,000.00 and ₱250,000.00 per beneficiaries.   

                

        EO No. 01, s. 2016 provides that PMS shall support the Executive Secretary 

in the provision of policy inputs to the President in the management of the affairs 

pertaining to the Government of the Republic of the Philippines; and to the Cabinet 

Secretary in the provision of substantive and logistical support to the Cabinet and in 

the monitoring and execution of Cabinet directives. It aims to provide inputs to 

specific programs and projects that seek to reduce poverty, improve the lives of the 

most vulnerable sectors of society; promote social education of the people to allow 

them to participate in effecting real change by keeping watch of the affairs of the 

government; and listen to people’s feedback. 

Pursuant to afore-mentioned EO, PMS-Office Order No. 2016-008 was 

issued to re-engineer the PMS for responsiveness to the urgent requirements of the 

Presidency and adapt to PMS significantly expanded and enhanced role within the 

Office of the President (OP). In line thereto, urgent personnel augmentations and 

deployments are to be made, which led to the issuance of PMS-Office Order No. 

2017-035 March 21, 2017.  Said office order provides, among others, the duties and 

functions of TCT, which includes the following: 

 To maintain and update databases of engagements, documents received, 
instructions of the SAP, assistance  to casualties; 

 

 To monitor and submit a report to the SAP on the status of assistance 
extended to battle/duty casualties and their families, and the general public 

in close coordination with the OSP.  

 

Interview with the TCT’s Overall Team Leader revealed that a database on the 

monitoring of assistance rendered to battle/duty casualties and their families is 

maintained by the said office as a monitoring tool on the said assistance. This 

database is being shared between the TCT, Office of the Regional Concerns (ORC) 



40 

 

and the Office of the Undersecretary for Presidential Support (OUSEC-PS), the 

latter office having the direct control over TCT.   

 

Verification showed that the monitoring report from the TCT was not 

submitted directly to OSAP, contrary to its stated duties and functions as provided 

in Office Order No. 2017-035; thus, the latter was unable to communicate the status 

of the assistance rendered to battle/duty casualties and their families and the general 

public, to the President or its authorized representative.  

 

The failure of TCT to submit the updated status of the assistance extended to 

battle/duty casualties and their families may hinder the Office of the President, to 

provide the financial assistance and supports urgently needed by the beneficiaries 

of the uniformed personnel who were either killed or wounded in action. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to enjoin the TCT to 

properly coordinate on reporting requirements with the OSAP to ensure 

proper guidance of the Office of the President or its authorized representative 

in the implementation of the SCPF.   

 

 

Excessive request of budget for capital outlay 

 

4. Unrealistic plans for the completion of the PMS Building resulted in idle funds 
transferred to the PS-DBM, aggregating ₱36,837,300.55 for four to seven years 

for the procurement of PPEs that were not necessary at the time of request  

thus, inconsistent with Section 7.1 of the Revised Implementing Rules and 

Regulations of RA No. 9184, which provides that consistent with government 

fiscal discipline measures, only those considered crucial to the efficient 

discharge of governmental functions shall be included in the APP. 

 

EO No. 359 promulgate rules and regulations, which shall serve as the basis 

for the procurement operation of the PS-DBM, and under Item 4(b) of the EO, it 

provides that the appropriation for the APP of agencies shall be identified in their 

Annual Work and Financial Plan (AWFP). The AWFP shall serve as the basis of 

the DBM in the release of the agency’s quarterly allotments and monthly funding 

warrants. It also provides that the agencies shall remit in advance to the 

Procurement Service the funds needed to service their requirements for supplies, 

materials and equipment as reflected in the said AWFP. 

 

Government budgeting is the critical exercise of allocating revenues and 

borrowed funds to attain the economic and social goals of the country for a given 

period. It is important because it enables the government to plan and manage its 

financial resources to support the implementation of various programs and projects 

that best promote the development of the country. 

 



41 

 

Information gathered by the Audit Team disclosed that the PMS building was 

retrofitted, to be structurally sound, beginning in CY 2015 and completed only in 

CY 2020. However, even before the retrofitting of the building started, the agency 

already requested allocation from the DBM in 2013 and transferred said funds to 

the PS-DBM for the procurement of PPEs to be installed/used in a retrofitted PMS 

building; and again in 2016, which again was transferred to PS-DBM. 

 

PMS budget aggregating ₱36,837,300.55 for the procurement of various PPEs 

to be installed/used in a retrofitted PMS building was transferred to PS-DBM in 

CYs 2013 and 2016, and recorded in the books of the PMS under the account 

Advances to NGAs (PS-DBM). 

 

Further, the Audit Team was informed that it was only in 2020 that the PS-

DBM conducted market survey, its BAC issued notice to proceed to winning 

bidders, and place the remaining required various PPEs under public bidding.  

Hence, an aggregate ₱36,837,300.55 idle fund was in the hands of PS-DBM from 4 

to 7 years, defeating  the purpose of government budgeting that allocates revenue 

and borrowed funds to attain the economic and social goals of the country for a 

given period. 

 

The account Due from NGAs (PS-DBM) of ₱171,755,899.27 represents the 

balance of the fund transferred to PS-DBM as of December 31, 2020, with the

It is clear that the CYs 2013, 2016 and 2019 APPs for capital outlay of the 

agency, which were the basis of the AWFP that was submitted to the DBM, 

exceeded what was necessary, contrary to Section 7.1 of the Revised Implementing 

Rules and Regulations of RA No. 9184, which provides that consistent with 

government fiscal discipline measures, only those considered crucial to the efficient 

discharge of governmental functions shall be included in the APP. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) make representation with PS-DBM to hasten the procurement and 
delivery of the needed equipment, and request for any remaining 

transferred fund to be deposited to the National Treasury; 

 

b) henceforth: 
 

i) request the release of allocation only for what is necessary for the 
period; and 

 

ii) prepare a meticulously and judiciously planned APPs, in accordance 
with RA No. 9184. 

 

Management commented that the issue was taken up during their Strategic 

and Execution Planning and Exercise (SEPE) in February 2021 and an assessment 

of their performance identified, as a brewing concern, the various items for 

procurement lodged at the PS-DBM. These items were envisioned to support 

programs and projects in previous PMS Planning Tools and Information Systems 

Strategic Plans (ISSP). Immediately after, PMS organized a small group of key 

stakeholders to closely monitor and coordinate with the PS-DBM, and fast-track 

completion of procurement, especially those in 2013, 2016, and 2019.  

 

Likewise, Management admitted that it is not the fault of the PS-DBM that 

the procured items were not delivered, but was due to the delayed completion of the 

PMS Building. This notwithstanding, Management humbly submit to the COA 

recommendations, with commitment to adopt the same as may be warranted, in 

keeping with government budgeting and auditing rules and regulations, and are 

taking measures to ensure that their budget is based on sound planning. 

 

 

C.     Other Areas 

 

Implementations of Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Budget (GPB) 
 

5. Programmed activities based on the agency’s approved GPB for CY 2020 were 
implemented with a total cost of ₱111,597,807.85 or 17.04 percent of the 

Agency’s budget of ₱654,568,000.00 pursuant to Section 31 of the General 

Provisions (GP) of RA No. 11465 or the General Appropriation Act (GAA) for 



43 

 

Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 that requires at least five percent (5%) of their budgets 

to addressed gender issues. 

 

Section 31 of the GP of RA No. 11465 states that all agencies of the 

government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within 

their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under 

R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women. The GAD Plan shall be integrated 

into the agencies’ regular activities, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their 

budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which 

relates to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic 

empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and 

fulfilment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance 

are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. 

 

The PMS GPB for the CY 2020 amounted to ₱110,361,294.50, which is 

equivalent to 16.86 percent of the Agency’s total appropriation of ₱654,568,000.00, 

however, the actual implemented GAD activities totaled ₱111,597,807.85 or 105.09 

percent of the budgeted amount and 17.04 percent of the total appropriations for the 

year, with the following details:
