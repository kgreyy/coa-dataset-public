The audit covered the accounts and operations of the PMS for the CY 2020. It was 

conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the Management’s 

assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as 

extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and regulations; c) recommend 

agency’s improvement opportunities; and d) determine the extent of implementation of 



iii 

 

prior year’s audit recommendations. Moreover, the audit was conducted in accordance 

with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). 
 
 

E. Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of 

the financial statements as of December 31, 2020.  
 
 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the audit observations and the corresponding recommendations 

that were discussed with the Management officials concerned, details of which are 

discussed in Part II of this report: 
 

1. Expenses for utilities, electricity, salaries and communication incurred in prior year 
totaling ₱1,549,668.32 were recognized as expenses for CY 2020 contrary to the 

accrual basis of accounting, as prescribed under Chapter 2, Volume I of the 

Government Accounting Manual (GAM), resulting in the overstatement of related 

expenses in the financial statements at year end.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief Accountant to 

prepare adjusting entries to correct the affected accounts, and henceforth, to strictly 

conform to the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the IPSAS. 

 

2. Various idle, fully depreciated and unserviceable Property, Plant and Equipment 
(PPE) with a carrying amount of ₱426,312.28 were kept only in storage for further 

deterioration and not reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of 

Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) as basis for dropping from the PPE accounts and 

for eventual disposal consistent with Section 40, Chapter 10, Volume I of the 

GAM.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the: 

 

a) Property Unit to expedite the inventory and inspection of all unserviceable 
assets, prepare the IIRUP, and submit it to the agency’s Disposal Committee for 

the immediate disposal of the unserviceable equipment; and 

 

b) Chief Accountant, upon receipt of the IIRUP, to prepare a journal entry voucher 
(JEV) to recognize the impairment loss of the unserviceable properties. 

 

3. The absence of a monitoring report on the status of assistance extended to 
battle/duty casualties and their families impacts on the guidance of the Office of the 

President’s implementation of the Socio-Civic Projects Funds (SCPF) to provide 

the financial assistance and support urgently needed by the beneficiaries of the 



iv 

 

uniformed personnel who were either killed or wounded in action as offices 

responsible failed to properly coordinate in accordance with their respective 

functions as provided for in the Office Order No. 2017-035 dated March 21, 2017. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to enjoin the TCT to properly 

coordinate on reporting requirements with the OSAP to ensure proper guidance of 

the Office of the President or its authorized representative in the implementation of 

the SCPF.   

   

4. Unrealistic plans for the completion of the PMS Building resulted in idle funds 
transferred to the Procurement Service-Department of Budget Management (PS-

DBM), aggregating ₱36,837,300.55 for four to seven years for the procurement of 

PPEs that were not necessary at the time of request  thus, inconsistent with Section 

7.1 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act (RA) No. 

9184, which provides that consistent with government fiscal discipline measures, 

only those considered crucial to the efficient discharge of governmental functions 

shall be included in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP). 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) make representation with PS-DBM to hasten the procurement and delivery of 
the needed equipment, and request for any remaining transferred fund to be 

deposited to the National Treasury; 

 

b) henceforth: 
 

i) request the release of allocation only for what is necessary for the period; and 
 

ii) prepare a meticulously and judiciously planned APPs, in accordance with RA 
No. 9184. 

 
 

G. Implementation of Prior Years’ Recommendations 
 

All the six audit recommendations embodied in the 2019 Annual Audit Report were 

implemented. Details of which are discussed in Part III of this report.
