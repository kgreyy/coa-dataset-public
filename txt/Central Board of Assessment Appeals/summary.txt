EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Central Board of Assessment Appeals (CBAA) was created pursuant to Section 

230 of the Local Government Code. Its mandate is to observe the due-process-of-law 

clause in the assessment and collection of real property taxes by the government, and 

to ensure that taxpayers are given the opportunity to be heard. 

 

Republic Act (RA) No. 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991 provided for its 

powers and functions, among others, to decide on all real property tax assessment 

cases, claims for refunds of erroneous payments which are under protests, and claims 

for tax credits for excessive payments of real property taxes and interests. All 

decisions of the CBAA are appealable to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) by Petition 

for Review [per RA No. 9282 and Rule 8, Section 4(c) CTA Rules].  Petitions for 

Review on Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court may be filed before the 

Supreme Court (SC) of the Philippines. 

 

The CBAA was headed by Chairperson Robert H. Tobia, and had 23 authorized 

positions, 19 of which are filled-up, while three items are vacant as at December 31, 

2020.

C. Scope and Objectives of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial accounts and operations of CBAA for CY 2020.  The 

audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on 

management’s assertion on the financial statements (FSs); (b) determine the agency’s 

compliance with laws, rules, and regulations; (c) recommend agency’s improvement 

opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit 

recommendations. 

 

 

D. Audit Methodology 
 

We adopted a risk-based approach in the audit of the FSs of the CBAA and in the 

review of compliance with laws, rules, and regulations.  The Audit Team which 

carried out the audit, among others: (i) examined financial and accounting procedures 

adopted by the CBAA and other relevant documentation; (ii) assessed internal 

controls regulating financial operations; (iii) conducted substantive testing of a 

representative sample of selected transactions;  (iv) carried out review, on test check 

basis, of a number of contracts and transactions related to movements in balances of 

assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses; and, (v) conducted interviews and held 

discussions with the concerned officials and staff  in the agency. 

 

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and the 

concerned officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda. 

 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

We rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the CBAA’s 

financial statements as at December 31, 2020.  

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

The audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in Part II of 

this report are summarized as follows:  

 

1. Accounting errors in the recording of various transactions of the CBAA resulted 
in the misstatement of the balances of the affected accounts in the FSs.   

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: (a) 

prepare the necessary adjusting journal entries to correct the 

aforementioned errors; and (b) observe the proper recording of accounts and 



  

 iii 

 

transactions in accordance with Section 2 (f), Chapter 2, Volume I of the 

GAM and other applicable accounting rules and regulations. 

 

2. Services already rendered in CY 2020 were not recognized under Rent/Lease 
Expenses and Telephone Expenses due to lack of billing statements, and were not 

disclosed in the Notes to FSs, thus affected the completeness and accuracy of the 

balances of the said accounts for the year, and the related Accounts Payable and 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) as at year-end. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant to: (a) 

request for an online statement of account to facilitate the recognition of 

expenses and payables for services rendered/delivered; and (b) disclose in the 

Notes to the FSs the expenses for a particular period not yet recognized due 

to non-availability of the supporting documents. 

 

The aforementioned observations and the corresponding recommendations were 

communicated to concerned officials of the agency through the issuance of 

Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations for CY 2020 Audits, and 

Summary of Unimplemented Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations issued on April 

5, 2021 for their further comments in lieu of an exit conference.  Management’s 

response was received on April 5, 2021, and its views and comments were 

incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

   

 

G. Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges 
 

There were no Notice of Suspension (NS), Notice of Disallowance (ND) and Notice 

of Charge (NC) issued during CY 2020. Likewise, there were no prior years’ 

suspensions and charges.  Disallowances at the beginning of CY 2020 amounted to 

P1.948 million with recorded settlement of P1,000.00 during the year, leaving a 

balance of P1.947 million as at year-end.  
 
 

H. Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations 
 

Out of the eight prior year’s audit recommendations, six were implemented while 

two were not implemented in CY 2020.  The details on the status of implementation 

are discussed in Part III of this report. 

 

We enjoin Management to ensure full implementation of all audit 

recommendations to improve the financial and operational efficiency of the 

agency.
