OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

Financial Audit 

 

Accounting Errors 

 

1. Accounting errors in the recording of various transactions of the CBAA 
resulted in the misstatement of the balances of the affected accounts in the FSs.   

 

The International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 provides 

that the financial statements (FSs) present fairly the financial position, financial 

performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful 

representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in 

accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 

revenue, and expenses set out in the IPSASs. 

 

Moreover, Section 2 (f), Chapter 2, Volume 1, Government Accounting 

Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) provides that expenses 

are decreases in economic benefits or service potential during the reporting period 

in the form of outflows or consumption of assets or incurrence of liabilities that 

result in decreases in net assets/equity, other than those relating to distributions to 

owners.  

 

Review and verification of the accounts and transactions of the Central 

Board of Assessment Appeals (CBAA), however, disclosed that certain Calendar 

Year (CY) 2019 transactions were erroneously recognized as current year expenses 

that resulted in the misstatement of the balances of the affected accounts in the FSs, 

as shown in Table 1.

(69.75)

(30.00) 

 (12,014.80) 

 

The expenses pertain to CY 2019 expenses from the petty cash which were 

replenished in the current year and recognized as current year expenses. According 

to the Petty Cash Custodian, the late submission of official receipts was due to the 

pandemic and the enforcement of alternative work arrangements where personnel 



 

26 

 

are on skeletal workforce, such that reimbursements were submitted when personnel 

reported to office. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant 

to: (a) prepare the necessary adjusting journal entries to correct the 

aforementioned errors; and (b) observe the proper recording of accounts and 

transactions in accordance with Section 2 (f), Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM 

and other applicable accounting rules and regulations. 
 

 

Accounting Deficiency 

 

2. Services already rendered in CY 2020 were not recognized under Rent/Lease 
Expenses and Telephone Expenses due to lack of billing statements, and were 

not disclosed in the Notes to FSs, thus affected the completeness and accuracy 

of the balances of the said accounts for the year, and the related Accounts 

Payable and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) as at year-end. 

 

Section 2 (a) Chapter 2, Volume 1 of the GAM for NGAs defines accrual 

basis as a basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are 

recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or 

paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the accounting 

records and in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. 

 

Verification of the general ledgers for Rent/Lease Expenses and Telephone 

Expenses for January to December 2020 disclosed that the rental of photocopier for 

the months of November and December 2020 totaling P12,992.00 and telephone 

charges for the month of December 2020 amounting to P3,884.30, respectively, 

were not recognized as expenses as at December 31, 2020.  Further verification of 

disbursements in the succeeding months disclosed that the rental  and telephone 

charges were paid on February 15, 2021 and January 29, 2021. 

 

The Accountant informed that the non-recording of the above transactions 

as current year expenses was due to late receipt of the billing statements from the 

UBIX Corporation and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT), and 

after the books of accounts of the Agency had been closed. However, review of the 

breakdown of the Accounts Payable in the Notes to Financial Statements showed 

non-disclosure on corresponding services already rendered but not yet paid due to 

lack of billing statements. 

 

Such deficiency affected the completeness and accuracy of the account 

balances of Rent/Lease Expenses and Telephone Expenses for the year ended 

December 31, 2020, as well as the Accounts Payable and Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) as at year-end. 

 



 

27 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant 

to: (a) request for an online statement of account to facilitate the recognition of 

expenses and payables for services rendered/delivered;  and (b) disclose in the 

Notes to the FSs the expenses for a particular period not yet recognized due to 

non-availability of the supporting documents. 

 

 

Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts/Areas 

 

3. COVID-19-Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 
 

For CY 2020, the CBAA had not received funds specifically for 

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) response and/or recovery but had utilized 

its budget for related expenses.  The COVID-19-related expenses charged to 

Personnel Services and Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses totaled 

P91,000.00 and P30,076.00, respectively. The results of audit of these COVID-

related transactions are as follows: 

 

On the provision of supplies/materials for hazard control 

 

Paragraph B, Section VI of Administrative Order (AO) No. 2020-0015 of 

the Department of Health (DOH) on Risk-based Public Health Standards Across 

Settings provides that at the minimum, all actors shall implement the prescribed 

interventions in various settings as presented under Annex A-Required Public 

Health Standards Across All Settings as at April 27, 2020, depending on their Risk 

Severity Grading.  For each prescribed intervention, concrete examples of 

corresponding hazard controls [e.g. engineering control, administrative control, and 

Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs)] are provided. Column D-

Offices/Workplaces of Annex A listed the administrative controls and PPE for 

offices/workplace, such as the provision of tissue, masks, among others.  On the 

other hand, engineering and administrative controls include placement of 

handwashing facilities, hand sanitizers and dispensers with alcohol-based solution 

in all entrances, exits and areas with high foot traffic and facilities. 

 

Whereas, Paragraph B, Section VII of the same AO provides that national 

government agencies shall develop and submit their sector-specific plans and 

guidelines on the operationalization of the risk-based public health standards to the 

DOH. 

 

The CBAA did not submit their sector-specific plans and guidelines to the 

Department of Finance. Also, the office orders and memorandum orders issued by 

the CBAA mostly pertain to alternative work arrangements during the COVID-19 

pandemic.   However, internal guidelines were issued in compliance with the 

aforesaid provisions of said DOH AO.  

 



 

28 

 

Review of the Office Supplies Expenses for CY 2020 disclosed 

procurements of bottles of alcohol from the Procurement Service totaling 

P4,576.00, which are regular supplies issued to employees but in increased quantity 

due to the pandemic.   

  

On the provision of transportation facilities to employees on skeleton workforce  

 

Item C, Section 4.0 of Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum 

Circular (MC) No. 18, s. 2020 states that reasonable transportation facilities and 

housing quarters shall be provided to employees assigned as skeleton workforce, 

whenever practicable, and subject to budgeting, accounting and auditing rules and 

regulations. 

 

The CBAA made available its service vehicles to facilitate transportation of 

employees on skeleton workforce who reported to office during the enhanced 

community quarantine (ECQ)/modified ECQ (MECQ) when public transportation 

was not available or was limited. Review of the transactions recognized under  

Fuel, Oil and Lubricants Expenses showed that a total amount of P25,500.00 was 

spent  on fuel, oil and lubricants for vehicles used as shuttle services of the 

employees.  

 

On the grant of hazard pay to employees during the ECQ 

 

Section 1 of AO No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 of the Office of the President 

authorized the NGAs to grant COVID-19 Hazard Pay to personnel who physically 

reported for work during the implementation of ECQ in their respective work 

stations, in an amount not exceeding P500.00 per day per person. 

 

Section 2 of the same AO provides the conditions on the grant of the 

COVID-19 Hazard Pay and that the heads of government agencies may grant the 

COVID-19 Hazard Pay to their personnel/workers without the need for further 

approval by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), subject to the 

following guidelines and conditions:  

 

1. The personnel are occupying regular, contractual or casual positions, or 
are workers engaged through Contract of Service (COS), job order (JO), 

or other similar schemes. 

 

2. The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for 
work at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed 

official working hours by the head of agency/office during the period of 

implementation of ECQ measures in the area of such office or work 

station. 

 

3. The total rate of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay shall be based on the 
number of days an employee/worker physically reports for work during 



 

29 

 

the ECQ period using the formula under Section 1, which is P500.00 x 

No. of days physically reporting for work during the quarantine period 

 

Review of the transactions recognized under Hazard Pay for CY 2020 

disclosed that the CBAA granted COVID-19 hazard pay at P500.00/day totaling 

P91,000.00 to nine CBAA regular/plantilla employees, who reported to office 

during the ECQ (March 17 to May 15, 2020 ) and Modified ECQ (MECQ) (May 16 

to 31, 2020 and  August 4 to 18, 2020).  

 

Verification of the relevant disbursement vouchers on the grant of hazard 

pay showed that the payments were supported with office order/s of CBAA 

employees authorized to work during the ECQ and MECQ, Daily Time Records 

and summary of all CBAA personnel who actually rendered service as Skeleton 

Work Force during the ECQ and MECQ. 

 

 

4. Gender and Development (GAD)  
 

Section 31 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act 

(GAA) for CY 2020, Republic Act (RA) No. 11465, states that all agencies of the 

government shall formulate a GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) designed to address 

gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the 

applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, 

Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the 

Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive 

Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022). 

 

Item 1.0 of the PCW Memorandum Circular 2021-01 dated January 20, 

2021 prescribes March 12, 2021 as the deadline of encoding and submission to 

Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) of FY 2020 GAD Accomplishment 

Report (AR) of executive departments and their attached agencies, through the 

PCW Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS). 

 

Item 7.0 of the same circular also states that CY 2020 GAD ARs submitted 

to the PCW shall be authenticated by the GMMS with a barcode. Concerned 

agencies shall print the GMMS-authenticated GAD AR for signature of their 

agency head and submit signed copies to PCW and their respective Commission on 

Audit (COA) Audit Team. 

 

The CBAA formulated a GPB, however, the PCW-endorsed GPB for CY 

2020 was not submitted to the Audit Team. 

 

 According to the Management, the revised GPB for CY 2020 was 

submitted to the PCW on December 9, 2020. The agency made several follow-ups 

with the PCW through email and telephone, however, the GPB is still pending for 

review/endorsement. As a result, the agency was not able to proceed with the 



 

30 

 

encoding and submission of the GAD AR for CY 2020 through the PCW GMMS, 

thus, a PCW-endorsed GAD AR was likewise not submitted to the Audit Team. 

 

Nevertheless, the CY 2020 GPB signed by the GAD Focal Point System 

(GFPS) Chairperson and CBAA Officer-in-Charge showed that Management 

allocated P1.227 million,  or 6.72 per cent of its P18.263 million FY 2020 

appropriation, for programs/projects/activities (PPAs) related to GAD. On the other 

hand, the GAD AR signed by the GFPS Technical Working Group/Secretariat 

disclosed that the  Management implemented all the 10 planned GAD activities and 

spent P1.202 million  or 98.02 per cent of its planned expenses for GAD activities.  

Some of the more significant GAD accomplishments reported by the GFPS, which 

were validated by the Audit Team on a test basis, are presented in Table 2:

8. Hiring of Casual, Job Orders, Contractual, and Consultant 
 

For CY 2020, the CBAA hired three JO personnel, consisting of two drivers

  Of the balance of NDs at year-end, the amount of P1.565 million pertains to 

the unsettled disallowances of the former Hearing Officer for the Visayas, under ND 

Nos. 2005-025 dated July 12, 2005 of P132,844.50 and 2010-09-095 (1999-2002) 

dated September 6, 2010 of P1.432 million. Both NDs were with Notice of Finality 

of Decision (NFD) and COA Order of Execution (COE) issued by the COA Office of 

General Counsel. The Supreme Court (SC) issued a decision dated June 2, 2020 

absolving the former Hearing Officer for the Visayas from liability under ND No. 

2005-025 for the amount of P132,844.50.   The Audit Team is awaiting for the SC 

Final Entry of Judgement as its basis for the preparation of Notice of Settlement of 

Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges (NSSDC).   

 

For ND No. 2010-09-095 (1999-2002), the CBAA filed a Motion for 

Reconsideration with the SC that CBAA officials, specifically the Accountant II, 

who is still in active service, be accorded the same humanitarian consideration of 

justice and equity as preferentially granted to the former Hearing Officer for the 

Visayas. The SC issued a resolution on August 25, 2020 to deny the petition with 

finality.  On July 21, 2020, the Office of the Solicitor General filed a Motion for 

Partial Reconsideration on SC Decision dated June 2, 2020.  

 

The remaining balance of the ND of P320,304.65 pertains to disallowances 

on salaries and benefits of the former Commissioner, CBAA, which was settled  

against terminal leave benefits and issued NSSDC Nos. 2021-01 and 2021-02, both 

dated March 31, 2021.
