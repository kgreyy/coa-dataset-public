A)	Scope and Objectives of Audit



The consolidated audit report covers the audit of the accounts and financial transactions  of the Bureau’s Central Office (CO) and 14 Regional Offices (ROs) for CY 2020. The audit was conducted to (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.



B)	Independent Auditor’s Report



	A qualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements due to various accounting deficiencies such as absence of subsidiary ledgers and lack of complete accounting records on various PPE accounts involving an aggregate amount of ₱70.587 which prevented alternative audit procedures to be undertaken to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence relating to various assertions on the accounts.

	

C)	Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



1)	Cash advances granted to various Accountable Officers by MGB CO and ROs CAR, I, II, III, IV-A, V, VI, VII, VIII, X and XIII during the year for payroll, operating expenses, official local travels and special purpose/time-bound undertakings amounted to ₱29.571 million, of which only ₱26.207 million were liquidated, leaving an unliquidated amount of ₱2.685 million at year-end, which is not in accordance with COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997.  There were no unliquidated cash advances in prior years. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountant of MGB RO I to demand from the concerned officers and employees to immediately liquidate their cash advances, which were already due for liquidation.



2)	Twelve MGB offices did not transfer funds to implementing agencies for CY 2020. Meanwhile, MGB CO transferred funds to implementing agencies (NGAs and GOCCs) during the year for the implementation of agency’s projects amounting to ₱6.457 million, of which ₱5.949 million or 92.13 percent were not liquidated, as of December 31, 2020, in accordance with COA Circular No. 94-013. There were also unliquidated fund transfers in prior years for MGB CO and RO VI, amounting to ₱12.064 million or 44.62 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱27.039 million. (Observation No. 6)



We recommended and Management agreed to require:

	

a)		the MGB CO Accountant to monitor the implementation and fund utilization of all on-going projects and demand liquidation/ refund of unutilized fund once completed;

b)		the Chief of Finance and Admin Division of MGB RO VI to follow up the status of the request with the MGB CO for additional budget for the completion of the MGB building; and

	

c)		if the project will be pursued, the Chief of Finance and Admin Division of MGB RO VI to consider revising the Memorandum of Agreement with DPWH RO VI giving emphasis on the terms and conditions thereon particularly the duration of the project; otherwise, require the DPWH RO VI to refund the unutilized amount transferred by the MGB CO to RO VI. 

	

3)	Fund transfers of MGB ROs III, VII and VIII to Procurement Service-Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) for its common office supplies and equipment requirement during the year amounting to ₱3.128 million were granted and liquidated in accordance with COA Circular No. 94-013. Meanwhile, fund transfers of CO and ROs IV-B, V and VI to PS-DBM during the year amounted to ₱28.050 million, and ₱21.527 million were liquidated, leaving an unliquidated balance of ₱6.523 million. Moreover, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years amounting to ₱2.434 million or 47.76 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱5.096 million. (Observation No. 7)



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief of the Administrative Division for MGB CO and the Property Officer for the MGB ROs IV-B, V and VI to:



a)		 coordinate with PS-DBM for the reconciliation of the cost of unused airplane tickets and deliveries of the items procured or request for the replacement of items prior to the preparation of new Agency Procurement Requests (APRs);

	

b)		 facilitate reconciliation between the PS-DBM and MGB records, prepare comparative schedule of APRs and the corresponding deliveries per delivery receipts and establish the costs of undelivered items, and

	

c)		for prior years balances, determine the necessity of the undelivered items. If the items requested are no longer needed, consider requesting refund of the unliquidated amounts with the Bureau of the Treasury.



4)	The MGB CO and 13 ROs insured against fire or theft with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) property amounting to ₱673.057 million with corresponding insurance premiums paid in the amount of ₱6.818 million, in accordance with Republic Act (RA) No. 656, otherwise known as the “Property Insurance Law” as amended by Presidential Decree No. 245 dated July 13, 1973. Except, however, in MGB ROs V and X where some property amounting to ₱56.505 million were not insured, thus, the agency is at risk of not being indemnified in case of damage to or loss of property. (Observation No. 9)



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the management of:

	

a)		RO V to require the submission of PIF to the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS; and



b)		RO X to request for allocation of budget enough to cover the insurance of all its insurable PPE.



5)	Unserviceable property of MGB CO and eight (8) ROs (CAR, RO I, II, IV-B, V, VII, X, and XII) with a carrying amount of ₱8.122 million remained not disposed of as of year-end, contrary to Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, thus, exposing them to further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value. (Observation No. 10)



We recommended and Management of concerned MGB Offices (CO, CAR, I, II, IV-B, V, VII, X, XII) agreed to direct the Property Officers to take immediate action to facilitate appraisal and disposal of unserviceable property, in compliance with Section 79 of PD 1445.



6)	Copies of 1,079 government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents with corresponding amount of ₱73.062 million of eight MGB ROs were submitted within the prescribed period and the same were verified to be complete and in order. Meanwhile, MGB CO and ROs I, VIII, X and XI with 455 government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents amounting to ₱51.539 million were not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from one to 267 days as of year-end.

(Observation No. 12)



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Property Officers of MGB CO, and ROs I, VIII, X and XI to strengthen their internal control system to address the above concerns and to direct the officials concerned to furnish copies of the dated perfected contracts/POs to the Audit Team with the complete supporting documents within five (5) days from the perfection and acceptance of the contracts as required under COA Circular No. 2009-001.
