 PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



A)	Financial Audit

	

Unadjusted accounting errors/omissions and uncorrected accounting deficiencies



1)	A qualified opinion was rendered on the Financial Statements due to various accounting deficiencies such as absence of subsidiary ledgers and lack of complete accounting records on various Property Plant and Equipment accounts with an aggregate amount of ₱68.810 million, which prevented alternative audit procedures to be undertaken to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence relating to various assertions on the accounts.



	Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 provides that “Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position; financial performance, and cash flow of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs.”

	

	Accounting errors and omissions amounting to ₱94.491 million were corrected by the Accountant, as shown below:

In view of the accounting deficiencies such as absence of PPELC with an aggregate amount of ₱68.810 million, which prevented alternative audit procedures to be undertaken to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence relating to various assertions on the accounts, a qualified opinion was rendered on the Financial Statements.

	

	We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountants of MGB ROs VI, VII, VIII and X to effect the necessary adjustments on the errors/omissions with the corresponding supporting documents. Likewise, direct the Chief Accountant of MGB CO and the Accountants of MGB ROs I, VI and X to comply with the requirements in the GAM for NGAs on the maintenance of PPE Ledgers Cards and the related accounting records.

	

	Management commented that the unadjusted remaining accounting errors of MGB ROs VI, VII, VIII and X will be corrected upon completion of documents such as Report of Supplies and Materials Issued, Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms and Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP).

	Likewise, the concerned Accountants and Property Officers of Central Office and ROs I, VI, and X are directed to comply with the recommendations for accounting deficiencies for Property, Plant and Equipment accounts.

	



B)	Compliance with Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements



High Fund Utilization/Obligation Rate



2)	Overall, the Bureau’s (MGB CO and 15 ROs) combined fund utilization/obligation of ₱1.340 billion is 96.13 percent compared to its appropriation/allotment of ₱1.394 billion. Also, it registered a combined utilization rate of 99.28 percent for Mineral Resources Enforcement and Regulatory Program.



Cash Utilization/ Disbursement Rate



3)	Of the total cash allocation of ₱1.314 billion of the Bureau (MGB CO and 15 ROs), received during the year, 92.24 percent or ₱1.212 billion was utilized/disbursed. Also, disbursements for Mineral Resources Enforcement and Regulatory Program amounted to ₱310.276 million. Transactions audited were found to be regular, necessary and not excessive, extravagant and unconscionable except for the disallowances issued on the overpayment of hazard pay, non-submission of Official Receipt, excessive travel claim and irregular reimbursement of expenses with a total amount of ₱0.427 million. 



	Reversion of dormant cash, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary fund

	

4)	MGB CO and 14 ROs have no dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds and related accounts for reversion as of year-end, in conformity with Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012, dated September 11, 2012, implementing Executive Order No. 431, dated May 30, 2005. All fees, charges, assessments, and other receipts or revenues collected, trust receipts and performance bonds and deposits, among others, except as authorized by law to be retained by the agency for its use, were deposited/remitted to the National Treasury pursuant to Sections 4 to 14 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA (Receipts and Income).

	

	Granting and Liquidation of Cash Advances



5)	Cash advances granted to various Accountable Officers by MGB CO and ROs CAR, I, II, III, IV-A, V, VI, VII, VIII, X and XIII during the year for payroll, operating expenses, official local travels and special purpose/time-bound undertakings amounted to ₱26.765 million, of which only ₱24.080 million were liquidated, leaving an unliquidated amount of ₱2.685 million at year-end, which is not in accordance with COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 and COA Circular No. 2009-002 dated May 18, 2009.  There were no unliquidated cash advances in prior years.

The balances of MGB CO and RO VII amounting to ₱0.462 million were liquidated as of January 31, 2021. Meanwhile, for ROs I, V and VI, the amount of ₱0.742 million, ₱0.470 and ₱0.953 million, respectively were liquidated as of March 15, 2021.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountant of MGB RO I to demand from the concerned officers and employees to immediately liquidate their cash advances, which were already due for liquidation.



	Non-Liquidation of Fund transfers



6)	Twelve MGB offices did not transfer funds to implementing agencies for CY 2020. Meanwhile, MGB CO transferred funds to National Government Agency during the year for the implementation of agency’s projects amounting to ₱6.457 million, of which ₱5.949 million or 92.13 percent were not liquidated, as of December 31, 2020, in accordance with COA Circular No. 94-013. There were also unliquidated fund transfers in prior years for MGB CO and RO VI, amounting to ₱12.064 million or 44.62 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱27.039 million.



In CY 2020, MGB CO transferred funds to the Ecosystem Research and Development Bureau (ERDB) for the implementation of the project “Palawan Quicksilver Mines, Inc.” amounting to ₱6.457 million.  Out of the total amount transferred, ₱5.949 million or 92.13 percent were not liquidated, as of December 31, 2020.



Moreover, the MGB CO and RO VI have transferred funds to the implementing agencies in the prior years with unliquidated amount of ₱27.039 million, ₱14.975 million of which was liquidated in CY 2020, leaving an unliquidated amount of ₱12.064 million or 44.62 percent, at year-end.

COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 provides, among others, that:

	

	Section 4.6. Within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the project, the IA shall submit the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds. Only actual project expenses shall be reported.  The reports shall be approved by the Head of the IA.

	

	Section 6.7.  The IA shall return to the SA any unused balance and refund of disallowance upon completion of the project. 



Verification revealed that the non-liquidation of the above fund transfers were due to the following reasons:



a)	Projects are still on-going



For MGB-CO, the balance of fund transfer of ₱5.949 million to the ERDB has a project duration of five years starting November 23, 2018 to December 2023. 



b)	Non-submission of liquidation report



The unliquidated prior year fund transfer to GOCCs amounting to ₱0.064 refers to the balance of fund transfer to the Development Academy of the Philippines for the implementation of the project entitled “Conduct of an Objective, Fact-Finding and Science-based Review of Performance of Existing Mining Operations-Phase II”, which was already completed but the IA failed to submit liquidation/ refund for the remaining balance.



c)	Non-execution of the project by DPWH 



MGB RO VI entered into a contract with the Department of Public Works and Highways, Regional Office No. VI (DPWH RO VI), Iloilo City for the construction of its office building located at Barangay San Pedro, Molo, Iloilo City, which shall remain in force until the completion of the project. Section 3.5, Article III of the Memorandum of Agreement, for Project Funding provides that:



The DENR-MGB shall release/transfer to the DPWH succeeding cash funds for the Project equivalent to the amount of previous advances liquidated based on Liquidation Reports signed by the Chief Accountant and verified and found correct by the DPWH Resident Auditor of the Commission on Audit.

 

Thus, the MGB RO VI has transferred the total amount of ₱12,000,000.00 to DPWH RO VI which remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020, as follows:



Date

	Check No.

	Amount

	12/23/14 

	2928518 

	₱                        5,500.000.00

	6/29/16 

	3008520 

	6,500,000.00

	TOTAL 

	 

	₱                      12,000,000.00



More than four years from the date of the last release of the fund to DPWH RO VI, the status of the project is still not started.



In a letter dated August 18, 2017, the OIC Regional Director of the DPWH RO VI informed the Regional Director of MGB RO VI that the transferred amount of ₱12.000 million was good only for micro piling due to the soil bearing capacity in the proposed location, and that if they were amenable to the scope of work submitted for the ₱12.000 million initial budget, they would immediately proceed with the work. MGB then started to look for some other proposed site for the construction of its regional office.

	

However, the Agency decided to proceed with the original site proposal. The resolution to proceed with the original proposal was finally decided by the previous MGB RO VI Regional Director, who then requested from the Director of MGB CO, for an additional budget for the construction of the building. The Management later submitted to the Acting Director of MGB CO, a budget proposal for the FY 2021-2023 Three-Year Rolling Infrastructure Program. However, as of date, it has not been approved yet.



Due to the non-acceptance of MGB RO VI of the proposal of DPWH RO VI at the early part of CY 2018, the ₱12.000 million fund transfers recorded as Due from National Government Agencies remained long outstanding as of December 31, 2020, due to the non-implementation of the project, depriving the national government of the productive use of the said funds.

	

This is a reiteration of the prior year’s observation, which was not acted upon accordingly by the Management







	We recommended and Management agreed to require:

	

a)		the MGB CO Accountant to monitor the implementation and fund utilization of all on-going projects and demand liquidation/ refund of unutilized fund once completed;

	

b)		the Chief of Finance and Admin Division of MGB RO VI to follow up the status of the request with the MGB CO for additional budget for the completion of the MGB building; and



c)		if the project will be pursued, the Chief of Finance and Admin Division of MGB RO VI to consider revising the Memorandum of Agreement with DPWH RO VI giving emphasis on the terms and conditions thereon particularly the duration of the project; otherwise, require the DPWH RO VI to refund the unutilized amount transferred by the MGB CO to RO VI.

	

Granting and liquidation of fund transfers to PS-DBM 



7)	Fund transfers of MGB ROs III, VII and VIII to Procurement Service-Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) for its common office supplies and equipment requirement during the year amounting to ₱3.128 million were granted and liquidated in accordance with COA Circular No. 94-013. Meanwhile, fund transfers of CO and ROs IV-B, V and VI to PS-DBM during the year amounted to ₱28.050 million, and ₱21.527 million were liquidated, leaving an unliquidated balance of ₱6.523 million. Moreover, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years amounting to ₱2.434 million or 47.76 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱5.096 million.



Item 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013 provides that it is the duty and responsibility of the Implementing Agency (IA) to return to the Source Agency (SA) any unused balance upon the completion of the project.



In CY 2020, MGB ROs III, VII and VIII transferred funds to the Procurement Service for its common office supplies amounting to ₱0.081 million, ₱2.656 million, and ₱0.391 million, respectively, which were granted and liquidated in accordance with COA Circular No. 94-013. There were also no unliquidated fund transfers in prior years.



Meanwhile, fund transfers of MGB CO, ROs IV-B, V and VI to PS-DBM during the year amounted to ₱28.050 million and ₱21.527 million were liquidated, leaving an unliquidated balance of ₱6.523 million. Moreover, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years amounting to ₱2.434 million or 47.76 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱5.096 million.

Among the causes of the non-liquidation are the plane tickets under the Government Fares Agreement with the Philippine Airlines that were not used during the CoVid 19 pandemic and the non-availability of ordered supplies.



The undelivered supplies/materials resulted in the delayed use by the agency of the items requested to be procured.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief of the Administrative Division for MGB CO and the Property Officer for the MGB ROs IV-B, V and VI to:



a)		 coordinate with PS-DBM for the reconciliation of the cost of unused airplane tickets and deliveries of the items procured or request for the replacement of items prior to the preparation of new Agency Procurement Requests (APRs);

	

b)		 facilitate reconciliation between the PS-DBM and MGB records, prepare comparative schedule of APRs and the corresponding deliveries per delivery receipts and establish the costs of undelivered items, and 

	

c)		for prior years balances, determine the necessity of the undelivered items. If the items requested are no longer needed, consider requesting refund of the unliquidated amounts with the Bureau of the Treasury. 



Dormant accounts for write-off



8)	Nine MGB ROs (I, III, IV-A, IV-B, V, VI, VIII, XII and RO XIII) have no dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers for write-off.  Meanwhile, dormant accounts of ROs X and XI amounting to ₱0.031 million were not requested for write-off, as required under Section 8.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.  Moreover, MGB CO failed to complete and submit the documents required to support their request for Write-Off of long outstanding receivables aging 10 to 30 years from the different companies amounting to ₱2.909 million.



Section 8.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 provides that “Head of the government entity shall file the request for authority to write-off dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances and fund transfers to the COA Audit Team Leader (ATL) and/or Supervising Auditor (SA).

b.2  	Proof of insolvency

b.3 	Certification form the Department of Trade and Industry that the debtor has no registered business

Dormant receivable of ROs X and XI account amounting to ₱0.031 million were not requested for write-off, as required under Section 8.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



The dormant receivable of RO X amounting to ₱0.013 million pertains to an unliquidated cash advance which was granted way back 2006 to a previous official of the agency who is now separated from the government service. 



For RO XI, the dormant Other Receivable account amounting to ₱0.018 million refers to the unliquidated cash advance granted for travelling expenses which have aged for more than 10 years.



Meanwhile, for MGB CO, the Accounts Receivable account as of December 31, 2020 showed a balance of ₱3.191 million, with a Net Realizable Value of ₱0.583 million and the Notes to Financial Statements disclosed that “The balance of Accounts Receivable account consists of dormant accounts from the rentals of drilling equipment from various mining companies, which have been the subject of litigation and overpayments to suppliers recognized as receivables.”



Review of the accounts disclosed that out of the ₱3.191 million, ₱2.909 million or 91.16 percent pertains to accounts receivable from the mining companies and catering services, which have been outstanding for almost 30 years. Details of information on said collectibles are presented below:

In our assessment of the request for Write-off, the management failed to prepare the Schedule of dormant accounts certified by the accountant and approved by the Head of the government entity. Moreover, they failed to submit proof of exhaustion of all remedies to collect the receivables as the last demand letter prepared was on May 15, 1992 and July 25, 1994 for Carbex Inc. and Drillfield Services and Consultancy, respectively. Furthermore, there were no proofs that demand letters have been sent to GNP Foods & Catering Services and Richfield Catering Services.



MGB CO has to comply with the requirements of COA Circular No. 2016-005 to avoid the denial of request. The presence of inactive account balance signifies weakness in the internal control system (ICS) in terms of monitoring the status of the accounts, as the management failed to exert utmost efforts in collecting the receivables from the Mining Companies and their Canteen concessioners.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountants of:



a)	MGB ROs X and XI to request for write-off for the amount of ₱0.013 million and ₱0.018 million, respectively in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016; and 



b)	MGB CO to strictly comply with the requirements of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 as to the documents needed to support the request for Write-Off to expedite the process and avoid denial of the request.

	

	Non-insurance of physical assets with the GSIS

	

9)	The MGB CO and 13 ROs insured against fire or theft with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) property amounting to ₱673.057 million with corresponding insurance premiums paid in the amount of ₱6.818 million, in accordance with Republic Act (RA) No. 656, otherwise known as the “Property Insurance Law” as amended by Presidential Decree No. 245 dated July 13, 1973. Except, however, in MGB ROs V and X where some property amounting to ₱56.505 million were not insured, thus, the agency is at risk of not being indemnified in case of damage to or loss of property.



Section 5 of RA No. 656 requires every government, except a municipal government below first class, to insure its properties, with the Fund against any insurable risk herein provided and pay the premiums thereon, which, however, shall not exceed the premiums charged by private insurance companies xxx”



The 14 MGB Offices (ROs VII and IX excluded) that insured with the GSIS their property amounting to ₱611.320 million with corresponding payment of insurance premiums in the amount of ₱6.485 million, in accordance with RA No. 656 are shown below:

Thus, the MGB RO V and X are at risk of not being indemnified in case of damage to or loss of property.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the management of:



a)	RO V to require the submission of PIF to the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS; and



b)	RO X to request for allocation of budget enough to cover the insurance of all its insurable PPE.



Non-disposal of unserviceable property

	

10)	Unserviceable property of MGB CO and eight ROs (CAR, I, II, IV-B, V, VII, X, and XII) with a carrying amount of ₱8.122 million remained not disposed of, contrary to Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, thus, exposing them to further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value.

		

Section 79 of PD 1445 requires that “when government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative xxx and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction xxx. In the event that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned.”



Unserviceable property with book value of ₱8.270 million that were already damaged and can no longer be used, repaired and reconditioned were not disposed of, broken down as follows:

A Disposal Committee was already created to work on the disposition of the said unserviceable properties and was already able to undergo training/seminar on the process of disposal. However, the said Committee said that they still need to go over with and update the inventory of the properties once again before they can proceed with the actual disposal in order to obtain a more reliable data of the unserviceable properties of the agency.

Delayed disposal of these unserviceable and obsolete property has crowded the storage room and continued to accumulate dust causing their further deterioration and loss of value. Likewise, the space occupied by these assets could have been utilized for more productive purposes.



We recommended and Management of concerned MGB Offices (CO, CAR, I, II, IV-B, V, VII, X, XII) agreed to direct the Property Officers to take immediate action to facilitate appraisal and disposal of unserviceable property, in compliance with Section 79 of PD 1445.

11)	This year’s procurement of MGB CO, CAR, II and X of goods, consultancy services and infrastructure projects, through negotiated procurement (emergency purchase), amounting to ₱21.384 million, ₱0.118 million and ₱0.720 million, respectively, were in accordance with Section 53.2 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulation (IRR) of RA No. 9184 (Procurement Law).

Management of the offices concerned disclosed that the delayed submission of contracts and POs together with their supporting documents were either due to non-availability of signatories during the pandemic, poor internal control system, improper turn-over of tasks/responsibilities between the outgoing and incoming Supply Officer, and multiple works, work from home arrangement scheme and other uncontrollable factors.

		

The delayed submission of contracts and POs precluded the concerned Auditors from conducting timely review and evaluation, thus corrective measures for the defects/deficiencies noted, if any, may not be corrected and communicated immediately.



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Property Officers of MGB CO, and ROs I, VIII, X and XI to strengthen their internal control system to address the above concerns and to direct the officials concerned to furnish copies of the dated perfected contracts/POs to the Audit Team with the complete supporting documents within five (5) days from the perfection and acceptance of the contracts as required under COA Circular No. 2009-001.

Meanwhile, the taxes on Service Recognition Incentive, Loyalty Pay, Productivity Enhancement Incentive and Hazard Pay Benefits for CY 2020 of MGB CAR employees amounting to ₱1.057 million were not included as compensation income, thus, these were not subjected to withholding and were not properly withheld nor remitted on time, which is not it accordance with Revenue Regulation No. 2-98 and Revenue Regulation No. 10-2008 dated July 8, 2008.



Section 2.78.1 of Revenue Regulation (RR) No. 2-98 defines compensation as all remuneration for services performed by an employee for his employer under an employer-employee relationship, unless specifically excluded by the Code.

MGB RO IV-B conducted webinar for the Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability (SCPD) wherein the speakers were only employees of the Agency, thus no cost was incurred.



In MGB CAR, none of the programs and projects were implemented during the year due to the CoVid-19 health emergency. While in MGB RO VII, for CY 2020 the agency did not formulate or implement any plans, programs and projects for the benefits of senior citizens and persons with disability.



These programs supposedly aim to support our government’s effort to improve the total well-being of the elderly and PWDs, and enable them to participate fully and become active partners of the agency in nation building.



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Regional Director of MGB CAR to implement the plans and programs for the senior citizens and that the Regional Director of MGB RO VII to formulate plans and programs intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability considering the current situation brought about by the CoVid-19 health emergency.

For CY 2020, a total of Notices of Suspension with a total amount of ₱4.265 million, and Notice of Disallowances with a total amount of ₱0.426 million, were issued by MGB CAR, VI and XIII. 



A total of ₱26.768 million were settled by the MGB CO and six ROs CAR, VI, VII, X, XI and XIII leaving an unsettled amount of ₱46.117 million or 63.27% percent of the total NSs, NDs and NC issued in Prior and Current Year. 



Management’s leniency to enforce the collection of the disallowances due from the agency’s employees and the amount charged resulted in accumulation of unsettled suspensions/disallowances/charges as required under Section 7.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006.



We recommended and Management agreed to enforce the settlement of audit suspensions, disallowances and charges by sending demand letters to concerned persons responsible and liable, respectively, and ensure compliance with laws, rules and regulations to avoid issuance of audit suspension, disallowances and charges in the future.
