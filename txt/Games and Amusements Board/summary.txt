EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Games and Amusements Board (GAB) was created by virtue of 

Executive Order (EO) No. 392 series of 1951, amending EO No. 120 and Republic 

Act (RA) No. 309, series of 1948.  It is under the immediate supervision and control 

of the Executive Secretary and headed by a chairman and two members who are 

appointed by the President of the Philippines. 
 

Initially, GAB was vested with supervisory authority over only three 

professional sports, namely: Jai Alai, Boxing and Wrestling, and Racing. In 1974, 

however, the regulatory and supervisory authority and functions of GAB over 

horseracing, except for the betting aspect thereof, were transferred to the Philippine 

Racing Commission (Philracom). Then in 1976, with the organization of the 

Professional Basketball Association (PBA), Presidential Decree (PD) No. 871 was 

issued expanding the regulatory and supervisory powers and functions of GAB over 

professional sports.  These are basketball, boxing, wrestling, betting aspect of horse 

racing, cycling, golf, billiards, and all sports activities where the athletes play for pay. 

 

EO No. 149 dated December 28, 1993 transferred to GAB the remnants of the 

Philippine Gamefowl Commission (PGC) pending its final abolition. Under this 

Order, GAB assumed the functional gray area of regulating and supervising 

international cockfight derbies in the meantime that the jurisdictional situs for the 

performance of this function has not yet been clarified. In a decision promulgated by 

the Court of Appeals in August 2011, the authority of the GAB to supervise and 

regulate Jai Alai was decided in its favor against Meridien Vista Gaming 

Corporation.  Subsequently, this resumed GAB’s supervisory and regulatory power 

over the Jai Alai operations in the country.   

 
GAB is headed by a Chairman and two Commissioners who are all appointed 

by the President of the Philippines with a term of six years. As of December 31, 2020, 

GAB has 143 filled-out positions and 15 Job Orders, details shown below:

The significant audit observations and corresponding recommendations were

comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate.

the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr).   



iv

coordinate with the BTr for the reconciliation of the balances of Cash-

Treasury/Agency Deposits in the books of GAB and BTr. 

 

2. Other Receivables of P5,592,514.42 under the Special Fund and Other Service 
Income was overstated by P315,786.60 due to double recording of the 2019

total Other Receivables account as at December 31, 2019, P5,276,727.82 

remained outstanding for more than 10 years in the books of accounts

a. continuously monitor and follow up the status of the claim of the Board 
from the PBA and MRBI, and the status of the action from OSG; and 

 

b. instruct the Accountant to prepare a Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to correct 
the double entry made on Other Receivables and Other Service Income 

accounts.

Plant and Equipment (PPEs), and non-impairment of eight Regional Offices’

respectively, affected the fair presentation of the Information and 

Communications Technology Equipment (ICTE) and Office Equipment (OE)

about of the eight missing equipment, and dispose them in strict
