OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Financial and Compliance 
 

Difference/Unreconciled balances of Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposits between Bureau 

of Treasury and GAB 

 

1. A total of P2,993,405.32 unmatched balances of accounts Cash-Treasury/Agency 
Deposit, Special Account, and Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust was noted in 

the absence of reconciliation between the GAB and the Bureau of the Treasury 

(BTr).   
 

As at December 31, 2020, the balance per books of the accounts Cash-

Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account, and Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit-

Trust amounted to P29,954,253.02 and P2,367,325.13, respectively.  

   

Confirmation letters were sent to the BTr on March 23, 2021 to validate the 

balances of the accounts as at December 31, 2020, however, the confirmed balances 

showed a difference aggregating P2,993,405.32, details of which are shown below:

The Accountant explained that she already coordinated with the BTr to thresh 

out the discrepancy. As of the audit date, the difference is still for reconciliation. 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 

coordinate with the BTr for the reconciliation of the balances of Cash-

Treasury/Agency Deposits in the books of GAB and BTr. 
 

 

Discrepancy balance of account Due from NGAs-PS-DBM  and  PS-DBM records 

 

2. A total of P682,912.48 discrepancy of Due from NGAs-PS-DBM account balance 
and its corresponding account balance at the PS-DBM was noted in the absence 

of periodic reconciliation of the intra government accounts.  

 



32 

 

The agency procures its common-use supplies from the PS-DBM in line with 

the national policy that procurement of government supplies by government agencies 

shall be through the PS-DBM. 

 

 Likewise, the agency also maintains airfare credit line with the PS-DBM. The 

funds needed therefore are paid in advance to the PS-DBM and recognized in the books 

of account as Due from NGAs-PS-DBM. This account was debited for amounts 

advanced and credited for deliveries of supplies and airfare expenses.  

 

Verification showed that as at December 31, 2020, the account Due from 

NGAs-PS-DBM had a book balance of P1,345,625.69. However, the confirmed 

balance from the PS-DBM was only P662,713.21 with a discrepancy of P682,912.48. 

 

Based on the subsidiary ledger (SL) as at December 31, 2020 provided by PS-

DBM on February 22, 2021, the Audit Team noted deliveries of supplies that were not 

recorded in the GAB books.  Further, airfare expenses and replenishment for the year, 

as shown in the SL of DBM differ with those recorded in the SL of GAB, and also 

noted was the unreconciled beginning balances of the two SLs, with the following 

details:

Beginning Balance 

discrepancy 

  476,054.43 

Total   682,912.48 

 

Inquiry revealed that the designated Supply Officer of GAB did not promptly 

submit to the Accounting Section the Delivery Receipts (DRs) and Invoices issued by 

the PS-DBM for completed transactions; thus, remained unrecorded in the books.  

 

As of the audit date, the Chief, Accounting Section is still reconciling the 

deliveries and airfare expenses against the purchase orders and billing statements. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the:  

 

a. Supply Officer to: 
 

i. promptly submit proof of completed transactions to the Accounting 
Section for recording in the books; and 

ii. periodically reconcile book balance with the records of PS-DBM in 
order to identify items that remained undelivered; and 

 

 



33 

 

b. Chief, Accounting Section to: 
 

i. effect adjustments in the books after the reconciliation with the 
records of PS-DBM; and 

ii. verify the unreconciled beginning balances of the two SLs amounting 
to P476,054.43 and adjust the books accordingly. 

 

 

Overstated Other Receivables and Other Service Income accounts 

 

3. Other Receivables of P5,592,514.42 under the Special Fund and Other Service 
Income was overstated by P315,786.60 due to double recording of the 2019 

Receivables already collected in CY 2020.   Moreover, out of P5,592,514.42 total 

Other Receivables account as at December 31, 2019, P5,276,727.82 remained 

outstanding for more than 10 years in the books of accounts.  

 

PD No. 871 dated January 6, 1976 expanded the regulatory and supervisory 

powers and functions of GAB over professional sports.  Section 8 thereof provides that 

any person, entity or association conducting professional basketball games or other 

professional games shall set aside and remit to GAB three percent (3%) of the gross 

gate receipts and income from television, radio and motion picture rights if any, which 

shall be available to defray the expenses of the personnel of the Board assigned to 

supervise the games and for such other expenses in other activities of the Board. 

 

Verification of the account Other Receivables disclosed a balance as at 

December 31, 2020 of P5,592,514.42 under the Special Fund and P273,220.50 under 

the Regular Agency Fund, or a total of P5,865,734.92. 

 

The Special Fund of P5,592,514.42 pertained to the three percent share of GAB 

from TV/Radio coverage of PBA games, of which P5,276,727.82 pertained to 

unremitted share in CYs 2003 and 2004, as follows: 

 

Particulars Amount (P) 

Unremitted share in 2003 3,776,727.82 

Unremitted share in 2004 1,500,000.00 

Total dormant receivables 5,276,727.82 

              

Likewise, the amount due from the MRBI of P273,220.50 pertained to GAB’s 

share of TV rights in 2002 that was paid in checks but dishonored by the bank due to 

insufficiency of funds. It is of note that MRBI already ceased to operate. 

 

Further verification revealed that the balance of P5,592,514.42 under the 

Special Fund was overstated by P315,786.60 due to double recording of the CY 2019 

receivables already collected in January 2020.  The amount was originally debited in 

CY 2019 as Other Receivables and credited as Other Service Income.  When it was 

collected in January 2020, Cash Collecting Officer was debited and Other Receivables 



34 

 

was credited.  Likewise, in December 2020 Other Receivables account was again 

debited and Other Service Income was credited, resulting in the overstatement of the 

accounts Other Receivables and the corresponding Other Service Income. 

 

As was discussed in the CY 2019 AAR, the PBA could not pay the 

P5,276,727.82 billing since it was not able to collect from the People’s Television 

Network, Inc. (PTNI), Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC) and 

Associated Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) who covered the games in 2003 and 

2004. According to Management, the money claim was already referred by the Board 

to the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG).  However, to date, Management is still 

awaiting for the OSG’s action on their request. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. continuously monitor and follow up the status of the claim of the Board 
from the PBA and MRBI, and the status of the action from OSG; and 

 

b. instruct the Accountant to prepare a JEV to correct the double entry made 
on Other Receivables and Other Service Income accounts. 

     

 

Deficiencies in PPE accounts 

 

4. The non-derecognition of eight GAB NCR’s non-existing/missing PPEs, and non-
impairment of eight Regional Offices’ unserviceable PPEs reported in the IIRUP 

with residual value of P8,517.50 and P215,414.20, respectively, affected the fair 

presentation of the Information and Communications Technology Equipment 

(ICTE) and Office Equipment (OE) accounts. 

 

Non-derecognition of non-existing/missing PPEs 

 

COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 provides the guidelines 

and procedures in the conduct of physical count of PPE, recognition of PPE items found 

at station, and disposition for non-existing/missing PPE items, for one-time cleansing 

of PPE account balances of government agencies. 

 

For non-existing/missing PPEs, Section 7 thereof requires the Property Unit to 

verify if the PPE items were already disposed with supporting Inventory and Inspection 

Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) or transferred/donated to other government 

agencies with supporting Property Transfer Report (PTR), and submit to the 

Accounting Unit the original copies of the IIRUP and PTRs for disposed and 

transferred PPE items, for recording in the books of accounts. 

 

Verification of the PPE account showed the following eight GAB NCR’s PPE 

items costing P170,350.00 and residual value of P8,517.50 still recorded in the books 



35 

 

but found non-existent/missing in the review of the agency’s Report of Missing PPE as 

of December 31, 2020:

This has been an observation contained in the CY 2019 AAR where verification 

revealed that Management did not follow the guidelines and procedures provided in the 

aforementioned COA Circular. 

 

Interview with the Property Officer disclosed that some of these items were 

already disposed in the past years, however, no records were presented for the said 

disposal; hence, the disposal was not recorded in the books of accounts. Likewise, no 

application for relief from accountability was submitted to validate whether any of the 

non-existing/missing items were lost. 

 

Non-impairment of unserviceable PPEs      

  

Section 40 (d), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that “all 

unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of 

Unserviceable Property (IIRUP). PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the 

books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE 

less Accumulated Depreciation).” 

 

Verification showed that eight Regional Offices’ unserviceable ICTE with a 

total residual value of P215,414.20 were included in the Report on the Physical Count 

of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) with comments either beyond repair, 

obsolete and no longer serviceable., which were reported in the IIRUP. The details are 

shown on the next page:

Non-impairment of these beyond repair, obsolete and no longer serviceable 

equipment affected the fair presentation of the ICTE account. 

     

Moreover, delay in their disposal expose them to further deterioration and 

diminution of resale value; hence, deprived the government of the income that could 

be generated from its sale. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the:  
 

a) Property Officer to thoroughly review and further investigate the 
whereabout of the eight missing equipment, and dispose them in strict 

conformance with COA Circular No. 2020-006 on the disposition of non-

existing/missing PPEs; 

 

b) Accountant to draw a JEV to recognize the impairment loss of the eight 
unserviceable ICTE reported in the IIRUP; and  

 

c) Property Officer to submit the IIRUP to the agency’s Disposal Committee 
for the immediate disposal of the unserviceable ICTE.

B. Other Areas  
 

Gender and Development Program (GAD) 

 

5. The agency formulated plans and programs for GAD for CY 2020 and incurred 
total expenses of P987,544.88 or only .8 percent due to the suspension of activities 

caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

Section 31 of the General Provisions (GP) of RA No. 11465 or the General 

Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year 2020 provides the Programs and Projects 

related to GAD.  All agencies of the government shall formulate GAD Plan designed 

to address gender issues, insofar as it relates to their intended functions, and integrate 

the same in their regular activities. 

The agency’s Annual GAD Plan for CY 2020 identified four programs, 

namely:  

 

1) General Administration and Support Services;  
2) Training and Support Services;  
3) Human Resource Section Services; and 
4) Regulation Services - Monitoring 

 

These programs were intended to address the following GAD issues/concerns:  

 

1) To celebrate the international women’s month;  
2) Limited participation/activities in the celebration of the Civil Service 

Month;  

3) Lack of awareness on GAD issues/concerns and training on gender 
mainstreaming by the GAB Focal System; 

4) Lack of training opportunities for female employees to handle technical 
positions; and,  

5) Limited understanding of GAD concepts which is pervasive among all 
employees.  

   

The budget allocated for these programs amounted to P4,000,000.00 or 3.24 

per cent of the agency’s total budget appropriations of P123,460,000.00, and for CY 

2020, GAB accomplished only the following GAD activities due to suspension of most 

of the activities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic incurring P987,544.88, as shown 

below:

Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability (PWDs) Program/Project 

6. The agency was able to formulate plans and programs for the benefit of senior 
citizens and PWDs in compliance with Section 32, GP of RA No. 11465 or the 

GAA for FY 2020. 

 

Section 32 of the GP of RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020 provides that 

all agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended 

to address the concerns of senior citizens and PWDs, insofar as it relates to their 

mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities. 

 

The GAB is mandated to supervise and regulate professional sports and 

games, namely: boxing, mixed-martial arts, muaythai, kickboxing, basketball, 

cycling, football, golf, E-sports, billiards, triathlon, Jet Ski, motocross, 3-point shoot-

out, cockfighting (international derby) and horseracing (betting aspect). Thus, most 

of the clients/licensees of the GAB are professional athletes who are young, 

physically fit and healthy. Very few licensees are senior citizens like golf senior 

touring pro, managers, trainers, and game officials. 

 

For senior citizens and PWDs, GAB has provided the following: 

 

1) Gang chairs or sofa in placed in front of Professional Basketball and Pro-
Games Division, Medical Section, Horseracing Betting Supervision 

Division and Boxing and Other Contact Sports Division; 

2) Sofa, tables and chairs are placed  at the GAB Lobby;  
3) Always priority in queues; and 



39 

 

4) Water dispenser is placed at the GAB lobby and is available for clients, 
including the senior citizens and PWDs. 

 

The GAB is also currently in the process of developing its Online Licensing 

System to make it easy for athletes especially senior citizens and PWDs (if there is 

any) to apply for their license. 

 

Likewise, the following facilities have been installed by the management of 

Legaspi Towers 200 to accommodate senior citizens and PWDs: 

 

1) Elevator (user-friendly with voice prompt); 
2) PWD Ramp at the entrance of the building; 
3) PWD Lift with standby wheelchair (to be assisted by building personnel); 
4) Standby Ramp placed on stairways; and 
5) Steel railings on stairs leading to GAB office. 
 

 

Disaster Risk Reduction and Management 

 

7. In compliance with Section 36 of the GP of RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020, 
GAB conducted and participated in the following programs: 

 

1) Accessible Emergency Exits; 
2) Well-placed Fire Extinguishers; 
3) Fire Sprinklers; 
4) Implementation of “No Smoking Policy”; and 
5) Fire Alarm 
 

 

Compliance with Tax Laws 

 

8. The GAB complied with the requirements under DBM and Department of Finance 
(DOF) Joint Circular No. 1-2000 A dated July 31, 2001 on the remittance of all taxes 

withheld on gross compensation income from the officials and employees for CY 

2020 and on taxes withheld from private entities regarding government purchases and 

contracts of service. 

 

The total tax withheld and remitted from salaries, other compensations and 

VAT/E-VAT on procurement of goods and services amounted to P5,873,856.69 and 

P5,195,015.13, respectively. The balance of P678,841.56 was remitted on January 9, 

2021. 

 

 

 

 

 



40 

 

Remittance to Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) (RA No. 8291) 

 

9. For CY 2020, the agency withheld GSIS premiums and deducted loan payment from 
the salaries of employees and remitted to the GSIS on a monthly basis. 

 

The balance of Due to GSIS amounting to P97,350.10 comprises of 

unremitted GSIS premiums, salary and policy loans as of year-end, which was 

remitted on March 1, 2021. 

 

 

Pag-IBIG Fund Contributions (RA No. 9679) 

 

10. For CY 2020, the agency withheld and remitted to the Pag-IBIG the amount of 
P3,304,867.04 pertaining to the premiums deducted and loan payment from the 

salaries of employees. 

 

The balance of Due to Pag-IBIG amounting to P8,006.90 consists of prior 

period unremitted Pag-IBIG premiums, which are still unaccounted as of year-end. 

 

 

Compliance to Property Insurance Law (RA No. 656) 

 

11. The GAB paid insurance premium on its insurable assets and properties amounting 
to P115,027.00 and P79,760.48 for fire insurance and motor vehicles, respectively, 

with the General Insurance Fund of the GSIS for CY 2020 in compliance with COA 

Circular No. 92-390 dated November 17,1992 as required under RA No. 656, 

otherwise known as “Property Insurance Law”, as amended by PD 245 dated July 13, 

1973. 

 

 

Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 

 

12. The GAB had no unsettled suspensions and charges as at December 31, 2020. 
However, disallowances amounting to P508,000.00 remained unsettled as of year-

end, contrary to Section 10.4 of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on Settlement of 

Accounts (RRSA). 

 

We recommended that Management continue to enforce settlement of the 

audit disallowances, in conformity with Section 10.4 of the RRSA. 

 

 

Status of Fund Utilization 
 
13. Based on the Schedule of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations Incurred, 

Disbursements and Balances as of December 31, 2020, GAB was able to maximize 



41 

 

the utilization of the funds allotted for their programs, projects and activities for CY 

2020, thereby attaining their mandates and accomplishing their targeted goals.  
 

There were no projects/programs with utilization rates below 75 percent. 

There were no fund transfers to NGAs, GOCCs, Non-Governmental Organizations 

(NGOs), and People’s Organizations (POs), and GAB has no Foreign Assisted 

Projects (FAPS) as of December 31, 2020.
