					EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

			

	Introduction

	

The Iloilo State College of Fisheries (ISCOF), formerly Iloilo Regional School of Fisheries (IRSOF), was established by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 1523, issued on August 21, 1978. An extension school in Alacaygan, Banate and a Marine Science Research Center in Dumangas, Iloilo were established, through the school’s expansion program. 



The issuance of Republic Act (RA) No. 8292, otherwise known as the Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997, and Republic Act No. 8760, otherwise known as the General Appropriations Act of FY 2000, integrated the Barotac Nuevo Polytechnic Institute, San Enrique Polytechnic College, Dumangas Polytechnic College and Dingle Agricultural and Technical College, all of 4th District of Iloilo, to the Iloilo State College of Fisheries.



	Consequently, Republic Act No. 10604, or an act converting the Iloilo State College of Fisheries into a State University to be known as the Iloilo State University of Science and Technology, was enacted on June 11, 2013. However, the establishment or conversion of the ISCOF into a state university has not been effected, pending compliance with the requirements for University status, as determined by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED).

		

The Iloilo State College of Fisheries is mandated to provide higher technological,   professional and vocational instruction and training in Fisheries and Marine Sciences as well as short-term technical and vocational courses and to promote research, advanced studies, extension works and progressive leadership on integrated fisheries development.  Its mission is to help Western Visayas achieve maximum agri-aqua-industrial development by providing responsive education and trainings on integrated fisheries development to cope with the diverse manpower requirements and specialized skills of the fisheries sector, maritime industry, education, information and communications technology, tourism, and local governance.	



Governance of ISCOF is vested upon the Board of Trustees, which exercises policy-making functions to carry out the mission and programs of the University by virtue of RA No. 8292.



ISCOF is presently administered by Dr. Godelyn G. Hisole as SUC President II.



The External Campuses are under the leadership of the following Campus Administrators:

Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements of ISCOF as of December 31, 2020 due to exceptions as stated below and in the Independent Auditor’s Report and as discussed in Part II of this Annual Audit Report.



Bases For Audit Qualified Opinion



The reported year-end balances of various PPE accounts of ISCOF totaling to P607.879   million were unreliable due to unreconciled discrepancies of P288.709 million between the Statement of Financial Position and the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE), contrary to Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Vol. I, thus affected the reliability, accuracy and the fair presentation of the PPE accounts in the financial statements;



The reported balances of various semi-expendable properties of ISCOF Main and Dingle Campuses amounting to P11.163 million which were already issued to the end-users were not recognized as expenses upon issue, contrary to Section 10, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, hence overstating the affected inventory accounts and understating the semi-expendable machineries and equipment expenses and furniture, fixtures and books expenses;



The inventory account of the College amounting to P8.437 million reflected in the financial statements was overstated by P8.004 million since actual stock on hand per Report on the Physical Count on Inventories (RPCI) only amounted to P432,457.20 as of year-end,  contrary to Par. 29(b) of IPSAS 1 and Section 12, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus affecting the assertions on existence, proper valuation and completeness as well as proper disclosure and the fair presentation of the Inventory Accounts in the financial statements; and

 

The existence and valuation of Accounts Receivable account totaling P49.090 million could not be validated due to non-submission of Schedule of Accounts Receivable (SAR) of ISCOF Main, Barotac Nuevo and Dumangas Campuses contrary to Section 27, Chapter 7, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. Further, Allowance for Impairment Loss was not provided for the Accounts Receivable balance of P17.567 million aging over three years contrary to International Public Sector Auditing Standards (IPSAS) 29, paragraph 67 and Section 10, Chapter 7 of the GAM, thus overstating the realizable value of the receivable account and understating the non-cash expenses and consequently, affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements. 



Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



The following are additional significant observations and recommendations, other than the bases for the qualified opinion that need immediate attention and action by the Head of the Agency:



1. 	Sixteen (16) disbursement vouchers and their supporting documents totaling P1.285 million were noted lacking/missing, contrary to Sections 107 and 127 of P.D. No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995, thereby affecting the  validity, propriety and regularity of the recorded disbursements.



We recommended and the Management agreed to:



a)	Enforce strict adherence by the Accountant and the Disbursing Officer on the immediate submission of lacking disbursement vouchers with the supporting documents totaling P1.285 million and to observe the deadline set for submission of accounts pursuant to Section 107 of P.D. No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 95-006; and



b)	Take appropriate actions against concerned officials and employees for the repeated failure to adhere to regulations on the prompt submission of reports.



1)	The College transferred cash allocation to the different External Campuses through funding checks for NCAs received totaling P152.076 million despite the existence of MDS Sub-Accounts in Land Bank of the Philippines, which is not in conformity with DBM National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 488 dated May 22, 2003, thereby defeating the objectives of attaining adequate cash management control and cost reduction for the government as a whole.



	We recommended and the Management agreed that the College President undertake the following measures:



a)	Ensure strict compliance with DBM NBC No. 488 and COA GAFMIS CL No. 2003-004 by discontinuing the  practice of releasing funding checks to operating units within the same Department/Agency;



b)	Adhere to COA Circular No. 2013-002 through the use of the proper accounts in the accounting of MDS transactions pertaining to State Universities and Colleges;



c)	Direct the Accountant of the Main Campus to transfer funds through the Notice of Transfer of Allocation (NTA) to  MDS Sub-Accounts of External Campuses to comply with the requirements of the above-mentioned circulars; and



d)	Direct the External Campuses to account for the balance of their unutilized Notice of Cash Allocations (NCAs) as of year-end for remittance to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) and to close their Local Currency Current Account (LCCA) used for Fund 101.



2)	COVID-19 Hazard Pay of the 184 employees of ISCOF in the amount of P1.651 million were disbursed despite the absence of the conditions necessary for the grant of the same, contrary to DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020, thus resulting in unnecessary expenditures.



We recommended and the Management agreed to:

a)	Strictly comply and observe the provisions of DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1 on the grant of COVID -19 Hazard Pay to government personnel to avoid issuance of Notice of Disallowance; and



b)	Properly scrutinize the utilization of needed services during pandemic in  order to mitigate health risks and to avoid unnecessary expenditures to be disallowed in the future as provided in Section 4 of COA Circular No. 2012-003. 

3)	Liquidated damages for a total of P336,946.72 were not strictly imposed on  suppliers despite delays in the delivery, contrary to Section 68, Item 3.1 of Annex D of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No.  9184, thereby causing undue disadvantage to the government.



We recommended and the Management agreed to:



a)	Require the Supply Officer and the Accountant to strictly impose liquidated damages as required under Section 68, Item 3.1 Annex D of the 2016 Revised IRR of R.A. 9184 to facilitate the proper execution of POs/Contracts; 



b)	Remind the supplier of Penalty Clause stipulated in the POs/Contracts; and 



c)	Direct the Accountant to compute and deduct from future claims of the suppliers the corresponding liquidated damages.



Status of Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges



Suspensions and disallowances totaling P6.987 million have not been settled as of December 31, 2020. No charges were issued to the Agency.





Implementation of Prior Year’s Recommendations



			Of the 98 recommendations embodied in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report, 59 were fully implemented, 28 recommendations were partially implemented and the remaining 11 were not implemented.
