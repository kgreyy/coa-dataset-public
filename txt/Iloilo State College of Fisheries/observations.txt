       AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

	

1.  The reported year-end balances of various PPE accounts of ISCOF totaling to P607.879   million were unreliable due to unreconciled discrepancies of P288.709 million between the Statement of Financial Position and the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE), contrary to Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Vol. I, thus affected the reliability, accuracy and the fair presentation of the PPE accounts in the financial statements.



Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1, states that the Chief Accountant shall maintain the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) for each category of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) including work and other animals, livestock etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise maintain Property Card (PC) for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like PAR.



Verification of accounts revealed that total discrepancies of P288.709 million existed between the acquisitions cost of the following PPE accounts as reported in the Statement of Financial Position versus the balances of the said accounts as contained in the RPCPPE, as summarized in the table below: (Annex A)

Review and evaluation of the PPE accounts disclosed the following deficiencies:



a. Unreconciled data of Supply Unit versus the Accounting Unit due to incomplete physical count of PPE since CY 2018;



b. Absence of periodic reconciliation of PPE account balances by the Accounting and Property Units due to non-maintenance of PPE Ledger Cards and Property Cards. Last entries of PPE Ledger Card were made in 2018 while Property Cards were not prepared; and



c. Construction in Progress-Buildings and Other Structures account totaling P148.282 million or 51 percent of the total variance was not reported in the RPCPPE by the Supply Officer because the Accounting Unit was not able to give the data to Property Unit as bases for recording.



Interview with the Accountant and Supply Officer of the College disclosed that the above unreconciled discrepancies were generally attributed to the non-conduct of complete physical count of PPE, non-reconciliation of records by both offices, non-maintenance or inadequately maintained records and difficulty in retrieving the source documents of those PPE accounts specifically acquired in the previous years to identify the itemized equipment, its description and other information. 



Nevertheless, the Supply and Accounting Units informed that it will take some time and with difficulty to make the PPE records of the latter offices reconciled. The conduct of complete inventory of the College’s PPEs has become a challenging task also because of time constraint and heavy workload of the Supply Officer which compromised the complete inventory taking of the College's PPEs.



However, both offices agreed that conduct of complete inventory-taking and periodic reconciliation of PPE are important procedures for checking the integrity of their records and to determine whether such PPE accounts actually exist and serviceable.  



The Audit Team emphasized that adequate controls should be adopted by the College to ensure that government properties are fully protected and it can only be achieved by good record keeping, proper monitoring and periodic reconciliation.



The foregoing deficiencies rendered unreliable the PPE balances presented and the fair presentation of the PPE accounts in the financial statements.









We recommended and the Management agreed to:



a)	Require the Accountant and Supply Officer to maintain and update PPE Ledger Card and Property Card of each PPE account and conduct periodic reconciliation of their records; 



b)	Require the Accountant to furnish the Supply Unit of necessary documents to be used as bases in recording the Construction in Progress-Buildings and Other Structures account of the College in the RPCPPE; and



c)	Submit a plan of actions with timetable for the conduct of inventory and reconciliation.

 	

2.   The reported balances of various semi-expendable properties of ISCOF Main and Dingle Campuses amounting to P11.163 million which were already issued to the end-users were not recognized as expenses upon issue, contrary to Section 10, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, hence overstating the affected inventory accounts and understating the semi-expendable machineries and equipment expenses and furniture, fixtures and books expenses.



Section 10, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that tangible items below the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 shall be accounted for as semi-expendable property. The following policies shall be applied as follows:



a)	Semi-expendable property which were recognized as PPE shall be reclassified to the affected appropriate accounts (if not yet issued to end-user), expense accounts (if issued within the year), or accumulated surplus/ (deficit)/retained earnings accounts (if issued in the prior years).



b)	The tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon issue to the end-user.

Verification of Semi-Expendable Properties accounts revealed that expenses were not recognized despite issuance of the same to the end-users during the year by the Supply Officer.



A summary showing the dates of issuance of these semi-expendable properties is presented in Annex B and summarized as follows:

Interview with the Accountants and Supply Officers of ISCOF Main and Dingle Campuses disclosed that the Property Units had not furnished the Accounting Office of the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) to support the issuance of semi-expendable properties to end users. They were not aware of the afore cited accounting policy that tangible items below the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 and considered as semi-expendable property shall be recognized as expenses upon issue to the end-users. 



The Supply Officers of the College reasoned that issuance of Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) to end-users to establish accountability over the semi-expendable property was adequate already, such that they did not prepare the RSMI. The Audit Team emphasized that the RSMI is used as the basis of the accounting office in recording the expense portion of the inventory accounts when issued to end users. To address this observation, the Accountants and the Supply Officers of ISCOF Main and Dingle Campuses committed to implement the recommendations. 



Consequently, the non-recognition of expenses on issued semi-expendable properties at year-end resulted in the overstatement by P11.163 million of the inventory accounts and understatement of the affected expenses accounts by the same amount.



We recommended and the Management agreed that the College President direct the Accountant to effect the necessary adjustment to the affected inventory and expense accounts by debiting the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) and crediting the appropriate semi-expendable properties to recognize the issuance of inventory totaling P11.163 million. 



3.   The inventory account of the College amounting to P8.437 million reflected in the financial statements was overstated by P8.004 million since actual stock on hand per Report on the Physical Count on Inventories (RPCI) only amounted to P432,457.20 as of year-end,  contrary to Par. 29(b) of IPSAS 1 and Section 12, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus affecting the assertions on existence, proper valuation and completeness as well as proper disclosure and the fair presentation of the Inventory Accounts in the financial statements.



Paragraph 29(b) of IPSAS 1 states that Fair Presentation requires an entity to present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information. Appendix A of IPSAS 1 on the point of view of Reliability requires that reliable information is where such information is free from material error and bias and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.

Section 12, Chapter 8 on Inventories of the GAM for NGAS, Vol. I on Disclosure and Presentation.  “The financial statements shall disclose:

Xxxx



b.The total carrying amount of inventories and the carrying amount in classifications appropriate to the entity;  



Xxxx



d. The amount of inventories recognized as an expense during the period;“



Moreover, Sections 14 to 16 of the same Manual prescribes the procedures to be followed and records to be maintained for recording, issuance, and transfer and/or disposal of inventory items.



During the year, the Supply Officer issued various inventories held for consumption to end users. As of December 31, 2020, actual stocks on hand per count and as reported in the RPCI was only P432,457.20, while the balance of inventories per Statement of Financial Position was P8.437 million, thus a variance of P8.004 million, as detailed below and in Annex C:

As gleaned from the table, it is apparent that issuances of inventory items by the Property Units of ISCOF Main and Dingle Campuses were not recognized by the Accounting Units as expenses during the year due to non-submission of Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) to the Accounting Unit of ISCOF Main Campus. For ISCOF Dingle, despite regular submission of RSMI by the Supply Officer, recording of inventory issuance by the Accounting Unit was delayed thus, issuances were not timely recognized in the books. In addition, Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs) were not maintained by the Accounting Office, thus rendered difficulty in the reconciliation of both records.



	Section 17, Chapter 8, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) provides:

	

“Section 17, Records, Forms and Reports to be prepared and/or maintained, among others:



c. Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) (Appendix 57) – shall be used to  record materials received, issued and the balance both in quantity and amount at any time. It shall be maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit for each kind of supplies and materials. The IAR, RIS, RSMI, PO and DR serve as the original sources of information for making entries on the card.”	



Interview with the Supply Officer of ISCOF Main Campus disclosed that she was not able to submit regularly the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) to the Accounting Unit due to lack of personnel. However, their office is now working on the report for submission to the Accounting Unit and she gave assurance for the periodic reconciliation of inventories with the Accounting Unit.



The conduct of periodic reconciliation of inventories between the accounting and supply units is an indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of both records, to determine whether inventory actually exist and whether accounting records agree with property records.

Consequently, the above discrepancies affected the assertions on the existence, completeness and validity of inventory accounts as well as proper disclosure and the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements as at year-end.



We recommended and  the College President agreed to:



a)	Require the Accountant to ascertain the composition of the account balances totaling P8.437 million and to coordinate and reconcile its record with those of the Supply Unit;



b)	Prepare and maintain SLCs for each kind of supplies and materials to provide basis for the inventory account balances; and



c)		Submit a plan of actions with timetable for the submission of RSMI by the Property Unit, conduct of periodic reconciliation and preparation of SLCs.

 4. The existence and valuation of Accounts Receivable account totaling P49.090 million could not be validated due to non-submission of Schedule of Accounts Receivable (SAR) of ISCOF Main, Barotac Nuevo and Dumangas Campuses contrary to Section 27, Chapter 7, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs. Further, Allowance for Impairment Loss was not provided for the Accounts Receivable balance of P17.567 million aging over three years contrary to International Public Sector Auditing Standards (IPSAS) 29, paragraph 67 and Section 10, Chapter 7 of the GAM, thus overstating the realizable value of the receivable account and understating the non-cash expenses and consequently, affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements. 



Section 27, Chapter 7, Volume I of the GAM on Financial Instruments requires the preparation of the Schedule of Accounts Receivable  as of reporting date to substantiate the corresponding balances per books. The schedule is supposed to show the aging as well as comments on the status of the receivable accounts in the Remarks column. These data are needed as reference in determining collectability of receivables.

Paragraph 67 of IPSAS 29 on Impairment and Uncollectibility of Financial Assets states that:



“An entity shall assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. If any such evidence exists, the entity shall apply paragraph 72 (for financial assets carried at amortized cost), paragraph 75 (for financial assets carried at cost) or paragraph 76 (for available-for- sale financial assets) to determine the amount of any impairment loss.”



Recognition of impairment loss for Accounts Receivables was specifically provided in Section 10, Chapter 7 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs Volume I, as follows:



“In case of Accounts Receivables, the Allowance for Impairment shall be provided in an amount based on collectibility of receivable balances and evaluation of such factors as aging of accounts, collection experiences of the agency, expected loss experiences and identified doubtful accounts.”



Audit of Accounts Receivable of the College totaling P49.090 million as of December 31, 2020 disclosed accounting control deficiencies enumerated in the table below which affected the reliability of the account. 



Out of the total Accounts Receivable of the College totaling P49.090 million as of December 31, 2020, P39.443 million pertained to ISCOF Main, Barotac Nuevo and Dumangas Campuses representing unpaid tuition and miscellaneous fees of the students. (Annex D)



Verification of the Accounts Receivables and interview with the Accountant of the College disclosed the following accounting control deficiencies:



Campus

Balance as at December 31, 2020

Deficiencies

ISCOF Main 

30,139,688.26

--	Non-availability of documents in past due accounts aged over three years

--	Non-preparation & non-maintenance of subsidiary records

--	Non-submission of supporting documents needed to provide Allowance for Impairment Loss for receivables which settlement could no longer be guaranteed 

--	Non-submission of SAR

ISCOF Barotac Nuevo

ISCOF Dumangas

7,470,022.57

1,833,013.99

--	Non-preparation & non-maintenance of subsidiary records

--	Non-submission of supporting documents needed to provide Allowance for Impairment Loss for receivables which settlement could no longer be guaranteed 

--	Non-submission of SAR



39,442,724.82





The Accounting Office of the College did not regularly prepare and maintain the subsidiary record of each account showing the nature and names of the persons from whom these receivables are to be collected.



The Audit Team requested for the submission of the SAR or other supporting documents needed to establish and identify the names of the accountable persons/entities as well as supporting documents to recognize the Allowance for Impairment Loss for receivables which settlement could no longer be guaranteed. However, the Accountants of ISCOF Main, Barotac Nuevo and Dumangas Campuses, contended that the requested data could not be provided to the Audit Team  at the moment due to lack of material time and personnel and difficulty in retrieving the  documents of long outstanding accounts. However, they committed to prepare the schedule and maintain subsidiary records of the accounts. 



Based on the foregoing, the Audit Team had no basis to verify the existence of the accounts receivable and ascertain the accuracy of the amount reported in the financial statements. Likewise, assessment of collectibility, identification of uncollectible accounts and indications of impairment were not facilitated.



As a result of the observed deficiencies, the realizable value of the receivable account was overstated while the non-cash expenses were understated consequently affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements. 



The Management informed that on March 2, 2021, ISCOF Dumangas Campus had collected the amount of P.510 million from the Municipality of Dumangas, Iloilo representing payment of tuition and miscellaneous fees of their scholars in ISCOF.



We recommended and the Management agreed to require the Accountant to:



a)	Prepare and maintain subsidiary record of each account; 



b)	Prepare the Schedule of Accounts Receivable and furnish a copy to the Audit Team;

c)	Assess the collectibility of the Accounts Receivables based on the aging of accounts and identify the uncollectible accounts;



d)	Provide the necessary Allowance on Impairment Loss on such receivables where there is doubt on their collectibility pursuant to paragraph 67 of IPSAS 29 and pertinent provisions of the GAM for NGAs Volume 1; and



e)	 Enforce collection of the past due accounts by sending demand letters to all students with known addresses and those who are still connected with ISCOF.



5.    Cash advances of ISCOF System were not liquidated within the prescribed period due to the laxity in the implementation of the prescribed controls provided in COA Circular No. 97-002  and CSC Memorandum Circular No. 23, s. 2019 resulting in the accumulation of outstanding cash advances of P8.677 million as of December 31, 2020 and non-recognition of valid expenses.



The limitations on cash advance were restated in Sections 4 and 5 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, which contains the rules and regulations on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances:



			“4.1 General Guidelines

	

5.1 The Accountable Officer (AO) shall liquidate his cash advance as follows:



5.1.2 Petty Operating Expenses and Field Operating Expenses – within twenty (20) days after the end of the year subject to replenishment as frequently as necessary during the year.



	5.1.3 Official Travel – within sixty (60) days after return to the Philippines in the case of foreign travel or within thirty (30) days after return to his permanent official station in the case of local travel.”



	Moreover, Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 23, s. 2019 provides for the Revised Guidelines on the Settlement of Cash Advance and the Penalty to be imposed for Failure of an Accountable Officer to Liquidate Cash Advance within the Prescribed Period.

	

	Audit of cash advances of ISCOF System for the period January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 revealed that cash advances for various purposes which amounted to P8.677 million remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020. It was noted that purposes for cash advances amounting to P.708 million had long been completed yet these remained unliquidated incurring delays ranging from 15 days to 6,519 days. Details of these cash advances are shown in Annex E. 

	

	The Audit Team issued various demand letters to those Accountable Officers with long outstanding cash advances to settle or liquidate the same but no settlements have been made.

	

	The non-monitoring and non-conformity with the rules and regulations on the liquidation of cash advances were attributed to the lack of strict compliance with the prescribed controls contrary to the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 and CSC MC No. 23, s. 2019. As a result, the non-liquidation of cash advances resulted in the accumulation of cash advances and non-recognition of valid expenses during the year.

	Management expressed their willingness to adhere to the audit recommendations. The College President directed the concerned persons to immediately liquidate their outstanding cash advances and submit an explanation why there was a delay in liquidating the said cash advances. 



We recommended and the Management agreed to:



a)	Require the immediate liquidation of all outstanding cash advances particularly those whose purposes have long been completed; 



b)			Strictly adhere to the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-002 on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances as well as CSC MC No. 23, s. 2019 on settlement of cash advances and imposition of penalty for failure of an Accountable Officer to liquidate cash advance within the prescribed period; and

		

c)	Require the Accountant to monitor outstanding cash advances to avoid delay in their liquidations that will result to its accumulation.



6.  Sixteen (16) disbursement vouchers and their supporting documents totaling P1.285 million were noted lacking/missing, contrary to Sections 107 and 127 of P.D. No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995, thereby affecting the  validity, propriety and regularity of the recorded disbursements.



Section 107 of P.D. No. 1445 requires all accountable officers to render their accounts, submit their vouchers at such time and in such manner as shall be prescribed in the regulation of the Commission.



Similarly, Section 127 of the same Code provides that, “any unjustified failure by the public officer concerned to comply with any requirement imposed in this Code shall constitute neglect of duty and shall be a ground for administrative disciplinary action against the said public officer who, upon being found guilty thereof after hearing shall, be meted out such penalty as is commensurate with the degree of his guilt in accordance with the Civil Service Law.  Repeated unjustified failure to comply with the requirements imposed in this code shall be conclusive proof that the public officer concerned is notoriously undesirable.”



COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 states:



6.05 “The official involved in the daily recording of transactions in the books of accounts shall turn over the receipts and the disbursement records with all the paid vouchers and documents evidencing the transaction to the Auditor within ten (10) days from the receipt of said documents.”



Verification of records pertaining to the submission of disbursement vouchers showed that there were still 16 disbursement vouchers (DVs) totaling P1.286 million including the supporting documents thereof from different funds for the years 2015-2017 that were found lacking/missing. (Annex F)



Of the 28 missing DVs in Calendar Year  2019, 12 of these were found and already submitted while follow-ups were constantly made with the College management for the submission of the lacking 16.



It is emphasized that non-submission of the missing DVs casts doubt on the validity, propriety and regularity of the transactions recorded in the books. Further, the non-submission of these documents for a considerable period of time could result to the issuance of Notice of Suspensions (NS). 



According to the Accounting office of ISCOF, the remaining unsubmitted disbursement vouchers in CY 2015-2017 were those DVs that were transmitted to the Accounting Office by the Cashier’s Office. Previously, it was the practice of the College that submission of paid DVs to the Audit Team was done by the Cashier’s Office. The incumbent OIC-Cashier was not able to trace these missing disbursement vouchers from their files because there were no records or reports available in the Cash Office. However, the management has already required the Accountant and the OIC-Cashier to fast track the retrieval of the remaining 16 missing DVs for immediate submission to the Audit Team and to strictly monitor the timely submission of the DVs in order to avoid the same deficiencies.

We recommended and the Management agreed to:



a)	Enforce strict adherence by the Accountant and the Disbursing Officer on the immediate submission of lacking disbursement vouchers with the supporting documents totaling P1.285 million and to observe the deadline set for submission of accounts pursuant to Section 107 of P.D. No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 95-006; and



b)	Take appropriate actions against concerned officials and employees for the repeated failure to adhere to regulations on the prompt submission of reports.

	

7.  The College transferred cash allocation to the different External Campuses through funding checks for NCAs received totaling P152.076 million despite the existence of MDS Sub-Accounts in Land Bank of the Philippines, which is not in conformity with DBM National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 488 dated May 22, 2003, thereby defeating the objectives of attaining adequate cash management control and cost reduction for the government as a whole.



DBM National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 488 dated May 22, 2003 was issued for the purpose of correcting the system, where cash requirements of Operating Units (OUs) are transferred by the Central Offices (COs)/Regional Offices (ROs) through funding checks which are deposited to a current account.  This Circular provides therein that the practice of transferring cash support through funding checks shall be discontinued; that transfer of allotments to OUs shall be thru Sub-Allotment Advice (SAA), and that the covering cash support of which shall be through Notice of Transfer of Allocation (NTA) where the Agency shall instruct their Modified Disbursement Scheme-Government Servicing Bank (MDS-GSB) to transfer a specific amount out of their NCA available  balance to the existing regular MDS accounts of the OUs. It is understood that the individual MDS-GSB of the recipient OUs shall be the same MDS-GSB as that used by the transferring agency.



Further, COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 prescribing Volume III- Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) to replace Volume III-The Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2015) of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies and specifically prescribed therein the use of the proper accounts in the implementation and accounting of the Modified Disbursement System (MDS).

The prescribed accounts for use in the accounting of MDS transactions are as follows:



a)	Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account



This account is debited to recognize deposits with AGDBs of income received for which the agency has authority to use; trust receipts authorized under specific contracts and agreements; Revolving Fund under specific laws; and other transactions covered by credit advices/memos received from the AGDBs. This account is credited for check disbursements and other transactions covered by debit advices/memos received from the AGDBs. 



b)	Cash-Modified Disbursement System (MDS), Regular



This account is debited to recognize the NCA received for its operating requirements. This account is credited upon issue of MDS checks/Advice to Debit the Account (ADA) and reversion of lapsed NCA with a corresponding debit to Subsidy from NG account.



c)	Subsidy from National Government



This account is credited to recognize the NCA for Regular and Special Account, constructive receipt of Non-Cash Availment Authority (NCAA) for advanced payments made by foreign creditors and donors; constructive receipt of CDC by Foreign Service Posts; Working Fund deposited to the foreign currency accounts of implementing NGAs for FAPs; constructive receipt of NCA for TRAs and Tax Expenditure Fund (TEF) Subsidy to GOCCs and NGAs; and, adjustments for lapsed NCA for Regular and Special Account. This account shall be closed to the Revenue and Expense Summary account or Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account, and/or adjustments.



Verification disclosed that the accounting entry drawn by the accountants/bookkeepers of the different external campuses to recognize the receipt of their share from the NCA received by ISCOF-Main Campus for their operating requirements is not in conformity with the above-mentioned COA Circular, as follows:

	Debit:Cash in Bank-LCCA

	

	

Credit:Subsidy from National Government



Debit:Cash in Bank-MDS, Regular



Credit:Subsidy from National Government





Audit of transaction of ISCOF-External Campuses showed that as of December 31, 2020, the College received NCA amounting to P264.047 million and has transferred to four of its external campuses the amount of P152.076 million thru funding checks. (Annexes G & H) The funds transferred were released through funding checks and deposited in their respective Local Currency, Current Account (LCCA) with the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) and Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP).



	The manner of recording the share of the different campuses was not in accordance with the Revised Chart of Accounts for National Government Agencies in the accounting of Modified Disbursement System transactions. The receipt of their share should have been deposited in the MDS Regular account with the Land Bank of the Philippines, the authorized depository bank of the College and not to the Local Currency Current Account (LCCA).



		It was likewise noted that the external campuses have already opened their respective MDS Sub-Accounts with the Land Bank of the Philippines and the existence of such accounts were confirmed by the Bureau of the Treasury as early as of 1st Quarter of 2018, however, these were not utilized by the external campuses. (Annex I)

	

	The practice of issuing funding checks for the operational requirements of each external campus prevented the implementation of the Modified Disbursement System (MDS) where any unexpended portion of their NCA for a certain period will be automatically reverted to the account of the National Treasury. The scheme enabled the management to transfer cash to the LCCA accounts of the external campuses, so that the unexpended portion of the NCA was not reverted resulting in the accumulation of huge amount of cash balances in the Cash in Bank – Local Currency, Current Account (LCCA). As a result, the objectives of attaining adequate cash management control and cost reduction for government was not facilitated.

	

	Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that ISCOF external campuses have been regularly remitting their unused NCAs from their Local Currency Current Accounts due to our previous audit recommendation contained in CY 2017 Annual Audit Report up to the present, although remittances of some campuses were done on the succeeding year. Breakdown of remittances of unused NCAs of ISCOF External Campuses for the Calendar Years 2017-2020 totaling P19.120 million are shown in (Annex J).



	We recommended and the Management agreed that the College President undertake the following measures:



a)	Ensure strict compliance with DBM NBC No. 488 and COA GAFMIS CL No. 2003-004 by discontinuing the  practice of releasing funding checks to operating units within the same Department/Agency;



b)	Adhere to COA Circular No. 2013-002 through the use of the proper accounts in the accounting of MDS transactions pertaining to State Universities and Colleges;



c)	Direct the Accountant of the Main Campus to transfer funds through the Notice of Transfer of Allocation (NTA) to  MDS Sub-Accounts of External Campuses to comply with the requirements of the above-mentioned circulars; and



d)	Direct the External Campuses to account for the balance of their unutilized Notice of Cash Allocations (NCAs) as of year-end for remittance to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) and to close their Local Currency Current Account (LCCA) used for Fund 101.













8.   COVID-19 Hazard Pay of the 184 employees of ISCOF in the amount of P1.651 million were disbursed despite the absence of the conditions necessary for the grant of the same, contrary to DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020, thus resulting in unnecessary expenditures.



DBM Circular No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020 sets the guidelines and conditions on the grant of COVID-19 hazard pay. Section 4.3 of which states, “The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official hours by the head of the agency/office during the period of implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine/Quarantine measures in the area of such office or work station.”



It can be gleaned from the foregoing Circular that the three (3) requirements for the grant of COVID-19 hazard pay are as follows:



a)	Authority to physically report to Office from the head of the agency;

b)	Use of prescribed office hours; and

c)	Work related to the implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) measures in the area.



Post-audit of disbursements relative to grant of COVID-19 Hazard Pay for the period March 16, 2020 to May 31, 2020 amounting to P1.651 million revealed the following deficiencies: (Annex K)



a)	In 97 instances, there were no specific Memorandum authorizing the personnel concerned to physically report for work at their respective work stationissued by the Head of the Agency. However, in ISCOF Main Campus a memorandum was issued by the College President addressed to the Vice-Presidents and HRMO informing them of the List of Personnel who were part of the Skeletal Workforce while in external Campuses, a certification was issued by the College President certifying that the concerned personnel is an employee of ISCOF and part of the Skeletal Workforce of the College;



b)	Except for the signatures of personnel reporting to duty, the attendance sheets did not indicate the time in and out of  personnel in 1,231 instances;



c)	Accomplishment reports of three personnel who were granted the hazard pay allowance were not among the supporting documents attached to the claim, thus determination of work done and ascertaining whether this relates to the implementation of ECQ measures as required by the regulations, could not be facilitated;



d)	A College Nurse of ISCOF Main Campus was erroneously paid the COVID-19 Hazard Pay amounting to P3,000.00 for the months of March and May 2020 despite receiving her regular hazard pay as public health worker, contrary to Section 4.5 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1, thus resulted in an overpayment of hazard pay;



e)	Thirty-nine (39) regular personnel and twenty (20) job order personnel were granted the COVID-19 Hazard Pay totaling P51,500.00 on March 16-19, 2020  and May 16, 18-22, & 25-31, 2020 despite that during these periods the area was not under ECQ; and



f)	Five regular and job order personnel were given COVID-19 Hazard Pay in excess of P7,500.00 of their actual duty entitlement due to erroneous computation of  such benefits.



The above conditions failed to meet the requirements set forth in DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1, thus the grant of hazard pay is devoid of legal basis.



It was likewise noted that 24 faculty and administrative personnel and 28 job order personnel who reported to duty and received the hazard pay were part of the Skeleton Workforce tasked specifically to produce and distribute Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), a job which was not related to the core function of the College. Work accomplishments of these personnel included, among others, the following:



1)		Pattern construction for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

2)		Drafting patterns on fabric

3)		Cutting of fabric

4)		Sorting of fabric per set

5)		Sewing of fabric

6)		Construction of face masks

7)		Repair of defective PPE

8)		Quality check of face masks  and PPE

9)		Packing and Distribution of face masks & PPE sets

10)		Document thru video the production of Face Masks and PPE



These PPE sets, the cost of which were sourced out of donations from the private sector and from ISCOF officials and employees, were distributed to various hospital front liners.  It was observed, however, that there was no Memo of Agreement between the donor and the donee, neither were these donations recorded and reported in the books of the College.



While the guidelines on the grant of COVID-19 Hazard Pay do not specifically provide for the kind of work to be accomplished by the personnel physically reporting during ECQ, it is imperative that only essential and necessary functions of the College shall warrant the adoption of a strict skeletal work force to support the operations of the College. Anent to this, CHED COVID Advisory No. 5 dated March 17, 2020 hereby provides that “HEIs shall direct all its employees to work from home except for offices which will require a skeletal workforce that will ensure the provision of essential basic services such as processing of salary, janitorial services to clean and disinfect facilities and offices and security services. HEIs with skeletal workforce must ensure its strict compliance with the precautionary measures directed by the DOH and quarantine measures enforced by the DILG and its respective local government. This arrangement should remain in effect until the enhanced community quarantine has been lifted.”



The Province of Iloilo issued an Executive Order No. 080, Series of 2020 which took effect on March 20, 2020 - An Order Enforcing an Enhanced Community Quarantine over the Entire Province of Iloilo for Stronger Protection Against the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019). Hence, the grant of COVID-19 Hazard Pay on March 17-19, 2021 and May 16-31, 2021 had no legal basis and therefore constituted an irregular expenditure.



It was also observed that the prescribed duty or work schedules for the 94 personnel of ISCOF Main Campus comprising the skeletal workforce were not apportioned for the week. CSC Memorandum Circular No. 10, s. 2020 defines Skeleton (Skeletal) Workforce (SWF) as a work arrangement where a minimum number of employees is required to man the office to render service when full staffing is not possible. Instead of enhancing protocol measures to provide protection against the spread of COIVD-19, the practice posed more risks of contamination and defied the Omnibus Guidelines on the Implementation of Community Quarantine issued by the Inter-Agency Task Force.



While the Audit Team commended the efforts of the College in providing PPEs for the front liners, it is emphasized that the grant of hazard pay for such activities was not in accord with the limitations of law for the grant of the same. Section 1.1 of the DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1 also states that, x x x. Said benefit shall be granted to aforementioned government employees and workers since they are inevitably exposed to health risks and hazards if they physically report for work during the period of an Enhanced Community Quarantine. Thus, COVID-19 Hazard Pay is an additional compensation for performing duties and for enduring physical hardships and exposure to inevitable risks in the course of the performance of duties during the ECQ.



Had the College President, in keeping with her fiscal responsibility, came up with other alternatives for its COVID-19 Initiatives and limited the movement of personnel to essential basic services, the College could have saved the amount of P.388 million, representing total amount of COVID-19 Hazard Pay paid to personnel reporting for PPE production, for more relevant projects and could have avoided unnecessary expenditures. 



Section 4 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 -”Unnecessary Expenditures”. This pertains to expenditures which could not pass the test of prudence or the diligence of a good father of a family, thereby denoting non-responsiveness to the exigencies of the service. Unnecessary expenditures are those not supportive of the implementation of the objectives and mission of the agency relative to the nature of its operation. This would also include incurrence of expenditure not dictated by the demands of good government, and those the utility of which cannot be ascertained at a specific time.



Management commented that in response to the immediate need of the front liners battling the pandemic, the college selected and authorized their faculty and administrative personnel and job order personnel to physically report for work during the implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine to produce and distribute Personal Productive Equipment (PPEs) which were scarce and of immediate need of the front liners. The said authorization was embodied in a generic memorandum that was issued, which the college conceived to be sufficient to comply with the requirement on authorizing some personnel to return to work during the ECQ period. The minimum health protocols were observed while the personnel were on the production process of PPEs and sufficient disinfectants were available on the production premises to keep the personnel safe while working.



It is also informed that during the ECQ period, the college allowed the selected personnel who reported to school to affix their signatures on the attendance sheet. Though the time in and time out could not be verified from the attendance sheet, the administration had employed various ways and means to monitor their physical presence. In fact, personnel remained in the designated working area even during lunch time.



It was required also by the CHED on its various calls for SUCs initiatives for State Universities and Colleges to submit a report on innovations that produced or created to address the needs of the people, especially front liners, in the fight against the COVID-19. Because of that, the college authorized some of the personnel to physically report for work to produce PPEs as one of its interventions in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic.



Moreover, the College President has issued a memorandum to concerned personnel of the College who have been paid with excess hazard pay to refund the amount and the same was already refunded by the personnel.



The Audit Team appreciated the management’s earnest efforts in giving its share during this pandemic. However, we maintain our stand that  when it could not pass the test of prudence or implementation of which is not relative to the nature of its operation, the expenditure is considered unnecessary expenditure of public funds  as provided for in COA Circular No. 2012-003.  The Audit Team emphasized strict adherence to the guidelines and conditions of DBM Circular No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020 and CHED COVID Advisory No. 5 dated March 17, 2020.



Likewise, compared with the Attendance Sheet, the Daily Time Record provides a more reliable and substantial record of attendance of personnel since information on time in and out of personnel are indicated therein.



We recommended and the Management agreed to:

a)	Strictly comply and observe the provisions of DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1 on the grant of COVID -19 Hazard Pay to government personnel to avoid issuance of Notice of Disallowance; and



b)	Properly scrutinize the utilization of needed services during pandemic in order to mitigate health risks and to avoid unnecessary expenditures to be disallowed in the future as provided in Section 4 of COA Circular No. 2012-003. 



 9.  Computation for the payment of Hazard Pay to the College Dentist and Nurse of ISCOF Main Campus was not in accordance with DBM_DOH Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2016 dated July 15, 2016, hence,  rendering the payment of P22,780.76 as irregular as defined under Section 3.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012.



DBM_DOH Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2016 prescribes the general guidelines on the new rules on the grant of Hazard Pay to Public Health Workers (PHWs).



Hazard Pay is an additional compensation for performing hazardous duties and for enduring physical hardships in the course of the performance of duties.



Post-audit of transactions involving the payment of hazard pay for the Calendar Year 2020 revealed that the College Dentist and Nurse of ISCOF Main Campus were paid the hazard pay contrary to the afore cited regulations which provides that the allowable amount be based on the percentage of the monthly basic pay and number of days of actual exposure. The table on the next page summarizes the noted deficiencies and details are shown in Annexes L & M:

It was noted that the College computed the hazard pay for the months of May and August 2020 based on the old provisions as contained in Section 7.2 of DBM_DOH Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2012 where the rate of hazard pay is dependent on the number of days of actual exposure. 



However, Section 3 of DBM_DOH Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2016 was issued on July 15, 2016 to amend the aforementioned joint circular and provides New Rules on Hazard Pay such that officials and employees who are not in actual service for at least eleven (11) working days in a month shall not be entitled to hazard pay, otherwise, hazard pay of 25% of monthly basic pay for salary grade 19 and below may be granted for PHWs who are exposed to the risks mentioned in the amended joint circular. 



In view thereof, the amount of P 22,780.76 which was in excess of what was allowed under DBM_DOH Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2016 was considered as  irregular expenditure  in the context of Section 3.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003. 



Moreover, it should be noted that the payment of Hazard Pay presupposes actual rendition of services in line with official duties which shall be properly supported with complete documentation.

We recommended and the Management agreed to:



a)	Discontinue the payment of Hazard Pay to the Dentist and Nurse of ISCOF Main Campus in excess of the authorized and allowable rate pursuant to DBM_DOH Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2016;



b)	Require the concerned payee to refund the excess amount paid; and



c)	Strictly observe the provisions of DBM_DOH Joint Circular No. 1 s. 2016 to avoid issuance of the Notice of Disallowance.



10. The grant of honoraria to the Regional Director of CHED Region VI as resource person during board meetings amounting to P14,215.00 was not supported by adequate documentation and bereft of legal basis.

		

Sections 58 and 53 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act for FY 2019 and 2020, respectively, provides that honoraria may be paid only to the following:



a. Teaching personnel of the DepEd, TESDA, SUCs and other educational institutions, engaged in actual classroom teaching, whose teaching load is outside of the regular office hours or in excess of the regular load;

b. Those who act as lecturers, resource persons, coordinators and facilitators in seminars, training programs, and other similar activities in training institutions;

c. Chairpersons and members of commissions, boards, councils, and other similar entities, including personnel thereof who are not paid salaries, nor per diems but compensated in the form of honoraria as provided by laws, rules and regulations;

d. Those who are involved in science and technological activities and render services beyond their regular workload;

e. Officials and employees assigned to special projects, xxx; and

f. Officials and employees authorized to receive honoraria under R.A. No. 9184 and its IRR.



	It was observed that for CY 2019 and 2020, honoraria in the amounts of P108,892.50 and P46,077.50, respectively, were paid by the different SUCs to the CHED Regional Director for her attendance to SUC governing board meetings (Annex N). Perusal of documents revealed that the CHED Regional Director attended the meetings as resource person. Among the documents provided by the agency to support the payment is CHED Resolution No. 100-2018 signed by J. Prospero E. de Vera, III, CHED Chairman, mandating all CHED Regional Directors to attend meetings of SUCs governing boards for the specific purpose of ensuring that the SUC get the certificate of program compliance first before offering any program (Annex O).

	

	 Apparently, this type of honoraria is not among those enumerated in the afore cited regulations for entitlement to honoraria, thus rendering the disbursement bereft of legal basis. Total honoraria paid by ISCOF amounted to P14,215.00 (Annex P). Of this amount, P6,500.00 was issued the Notices of Suspension (NS) and was eventually refunded.  

	

	Honoraria for those who act as lecturers and resource persons is governed by DBM Budget Circular 2007-1 dated April 23, 2007 which provides in part, the following:

	

	“Section 2.3. A resource person is any person who by virtue of his /her expertise on a specific subject area, serves as speaker in seminars, conferences, symposia, training programs and similar activities.

	

	Section 4.5. Honoraria shall not be granted to the designated lecturer, resource persons and facilitators within their respective sponsoring agencies as such services are deemed part of the duties and responsibilities of their appointive positions to dessiminate information, to clarify issues and concerns and to interact with clients and /or implementors of agency mandates.”

	

	One of the functions of the CHED Regional Office is to monitor and evaluate the performance of Higher Education Institutions in the region in terms of compliance to minimum standards for various higher education programs. Thus, it can be gleaned from the foregoing that the directive of the CHED Chairman for the CHED Regional Director to attend BOT meetings was in line with the pursuance of its mandate, deemed part of the duties and responsibilities of the CHED Regional Director’s appointive position and therefore covered by limitations provided in Section 4.5 of the DBM Budget Circular 2007-1.

	

	Likewise, the following deficiencies were also observed:



	a)	Claims for honoraria were not supported with complete supporting documents such as minutes of the meeting and attendance sheet to establish the veracity of the claim;



	b. 	Information on how the amounts of disbursement were arrived at were not included in the attachments/documents submitted; and



	c. Taxes were not withheld from the payments of honoraria in two instances in CY 2019.



The Audit Team requested for the submission of supporting documents on the payment of honoraria but until April 30, 2021, only the proposed agenda of the Board of Trustees meeting was submitted.



Due to the absence of legal basis and insufficiency of documents to support the payment, the  honoraria being granted to the Regional Director of CHED Region VI in connection with her attendance to BOT meetings was deemed not valid and proper.



The non-withholding of taxes for honoraria payments by the Head of the Agency and the Accountant who are charged with the duty to deduct and withhold  any internal revenue tax and remit the same in accordance with the provision of National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of the Philippines, deprived the national government of income for its programs and projects. It also exposed the College to the risk of paying tax penalties, interests and surcharges.



We recommended and the Management agreed to:



a)	Submit authority for the grant of honoraria duly supported with adequate documents to establish the veracity of the claim. Henceforth, stop the practice of granting honoraria and other forms of allowances in the absence of legal basis; and

b)	Require the Accountant to deduct and withhold taxes according to the revised rates of creditable  withhold tax pursuant to the BIR Revenue Regulations No. 11-2018 and observe timely remittance thereof.



11. The Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) of ISCOF  failed to exercise due diligence in the procurement of vehicle rental services in the amount of P50,000.00 during the 3-day Capability Building Conference in violation to the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 9184. Hence, the expense was found to be excessive as defined under Section 5.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012.



The guiding principles of government procurement as embodied in R.A. No. 9184 and its implementing guidelines include, among others, transparency and competitiveness and that the Procuring Entity shall ensure that the objectives and purpose of the contract do not constitute an unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or unconscionable expenditure.



Section 5.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 defines excessive expenditures as  “unreasonable expense or expense incurred at an immoderate quantity and exorbitant price. It also includes expenses which exceed what is usual or proper, as well as expenses which are unreasonably high and beyond just measure or amount. They also include expenses in excess of reasonable limits.”



The College spent the amount of P50,000.00 for van rentals during the 3-day Capability Building Conference to transport guest participants from airport or seaport to venue and vice-versa. Post-audit of the transaction showed the following conditions which manifested an uneconomical use of government funds resulting in incurrence of excessive expenditures as well as deficiencies in the procurement procedures:



a)	The College failed to carefully examine the Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC) of P50,000.00 for the rental of vans to transport guest participants from airport or seaport to venue and vice-versa with the following cost breakdown:

The above-stated rate per itinerary is way above the rental rate which normally ranges from P3,000.00 to P3,500.00 per day  for eight hours within city limit and with an additional amount outside the city such as the Iloilo International Airport in Cabatuan, Iloilo. Nevertheless, there were two instances when the College has paid the Contractor on September 19-20, 2019 the amount of P5,000.00 per van but no itinerary was scheduled for its use. 



Had the College meticulously scrutinized the actual amount and properly scheduled transportation needs of the guest participants, the rates could have been lower and the ABC should have been less than the amount set.



Based on the foregoing, the Audit Team would like to emphasize that government funds should be fully protected and a sense of prudency in all government dealings has to be observed at all times.



b)	The procurement method employed by the College for the rental of vehicle was not strictly in accordance with the provisions and procedures under R.A. No. 9184. 



The College resorted to Shopping under Section 52.1a as the mode of procurement on the hiring of vehicle due to the urgent need and to promote economy and efficiency as recommended by the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) per BAC Resolution No. 198, S. 2019 dated September 11, 2019.



Section C.1 Annex H of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 9184 defines “Shopping as a method of procurement of goods whereby the Procuring Entity simply requests for the submission of price quotations for readily available off-the-shelf goods or ordinary/regular equipment to be procured directly from suppliers of known qualifications. This method of procurement shall be employed in any of the following cases:



a)	When there is an unforeseen contingency requiring immediate purchase, xxxx



The phrase “ordinary or regular office supplies” shall be understood to include those supplies, commodities, or materials which are necessary in the transaction of official businesses, and consumed in the day-to-day operations.

However, office supplies shall not include services such as repair and maintenance of equipment and furniture, as well as trucking, hauling, janitorial, security, and related or analogous services.”



Obviously, services such as vehicle rentals do not fall under the afore-cited method of procurement instead, small value procurement under negotiated procurement should have been employed.



Perusal of terminal reports showed that as early as August 22, 2019, meetings have been held for the preparation of the 3-day Capability Activity on Design Thinking for Higher Education, hence, the condition on unforeseen contingency required in shopping as mode of procurement has not been met.



Moreover, such procurement practice deprived the College of the most advantageous and competitive price available in the market, hence, it failed to uphold the best interest of the government.



c)	An advance payment equivalent to 100% of the contract was paid thru reimbursement prior to the start of rental services contrary to Section 4.3 Annex D of R.A. No. 9184. 



Section 4.3 Annex D of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 9184 provides that:



“4. Advance Payment

4.1. Xxxx

4.2. Xxxx



4.3. A single advance payment not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the contract amount shall be allowed for contracts entered into by a procuring entity for the following services where requirement of down payment is a standard industry practice: 



a)	Hotel and restaurant services;

 

b)	Use of conference/seminar and exhibit areas; and  



c)	Lease of office space.  



4.4. Advance payment not to exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the contract amount, unless otherwise directed by the President, shall also be allowed for procurement of goods required to address contingencies arising from natural or man-made calamities in areas where a “State of Calamity” has been declared by appropriate authorities.”



Post-audit of Disbursement Voucher No. 2019-12-1685 with LBP Check No. 720514 dated December 16, 2019 totaling P50,000.00 disclosed that the rental service was claimed through reimbursement by the canvasser who was also one of the Members of Transportation Committee for the said activity. Payment of P50,000.00 was made in advance by the canvasser on September 16, 2019 per Official Receipt  No. 2632 upon receipt by the Contractor of the Letter Order No. 2019-09-037 on the same date.



Considering that van rental services are not among those allowed by regulations for the advance payments and/or full payment prior to commencement of contract, payment of van rental services of P50,000.00 was considered improper. Consequently, the advance payment also deprived the College from withholding any tax due to the government.



We recommended and the Management agreed to:



a)		Direct the BAC to submit justifications on the above deficiencies and henceforth, strictly observe and comply with the rules and regulations as provided in Annexes D and H R.A. No. 9184 and its Revised IRR  to promote transparency and ensure economy and efficiency in the procurement process; 

	

b)		Require the BAC to properly scrutinize the ABC and the propriety of needed services in order to avoid excessive expenditures; and 



c)		Require the Finance Office to directly pay the suppliers through checks and stop the payment thru reimbursement in the disposition of financial transactions in order to comply with the withholding of appropriate taxes.



12. 	Liquidated damages for a total of P336,946.72 were not strictly imposed on  suppliers despite delays in the delivery, contrary to Section 68, Item 3.1 of Annex D of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No.  9184, thereby causing undue disadvantage to the government.



Item 3.1 of Annex D of the 2016 Revised IRR pursuant to Section 68 of R.A. 9184 states that:



“When the supplier fails to satisfactorily deliver goods under the contract within the specified delivery schedule, inclusive of duly granted time extensions, if any, the supplier shall be liable for damages for the delay and shall pay the procuring entity liquidated damages, not by way of penalty, an amount equal to one-tenth (1/10) of one percent (1%) of the cost of the delayed goods scheduled for delivery for every day of delay until such goods are finally delivered and accepted by the procuring entity concerned.”



Post-audit of disbursement vouchers together with supporting documents disclosed that delays in contract delivery were incurred in a number of purchase orders entered into by ISCOF Main Campus, San Enrique Campus and Dumangas Campus for the Calendar Years 2018-2020. It was noted that liquidated damages which could have amounted to P336,946.72 were not imposed on these delays contrary to the aforementioned provisions of law as summarized in the table on the next page: (See Annex Q)





















Campus

336,946.72



The condition at hand noticeably indicated lapses on the part of the Supply Officer and the Accountant to monitor delays in the contract deliveries of goods and subsequently compute the liquidated damages to be deducted from account of the suppliers. 



The Accountant and Supply Officer of the College admitted that although they were aware of the penalty clause in the purchase orders (POs) on delayed deliveries, they were lax on the monitoring of the date of deliveries on the POs and failed to impose liquidated damages on delayed deliveries. 



	 Failure of the College to impose liquidated damages on these suppliers is not in keeping with Section 68 of RA No. 9184 and caused undue disadvantage to the government.



We recommended and the Management agreed to:



a)	Require the Supply Officer and the Accountant to strictly impose liquidated damages as required under Section 68, Item 3.1 Annex D of the 2016 Revised IRR of R.A. 9184 to facilitate the proper execution of POs/Contracts; 



b)	Remind the supplier of Penalty Clause stipulated in the POs/Contracts; and 



c)	Direct the Accountant to compute and deduct from future claims of the suppliers the corresponding liquidated damages.



13. The required processes in the formulation and revision of the Project Procurement Management Plan (PPMP) and the Annual Procurement Plan (APP) of ISCOF as prescribed in Section 7, Rule II of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act were not observed and the required essential information were not reflected in the revised PPMP and APP, thus defeating the purpose of their usefulness as an effective tool to sustain a meticulous and judicious procurement planning.



Section 7, Rule II of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulation of R.A. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act, provides:



“7.1 Xxxxx



7.2 No procurement shall be undertaken unless it is in accordance with the approved APP, including approved changes thereto. The APP must be consistent with the duly approved yearly budget of the Procuring Entity and shall bear the approval of the HoPE or second-ranking official designated by the HoPE to act on his behalf.



7.3. The APP shall be formulated and revised only in accordance with the following guidelines: 



7.3.1. Upon issuance of the budget call in the case of NGAs, SUCs,xxxx, the Procuring Entity shall prepare its indicative APP for the succeeding calendar year to support its proposed budget taking into consideration the budget framework for that year in order to reflect its priorities and objectives.



7.3.2. In the preparation of the indicative APP, the end-user or implementing units of the Procuring Entity shall formulate their respective Project Procurement Management Plans (PPMPs) for their different programs, activities, and projects (PAPs). The PPMP shall include: 



a)	Information on whether the  PAPs will be contracted out, implemented by administration in accordance with the guidelines issued by the GPPB, or consigned;

b)	the type and objective of contract to be employed;

c)	the extent/size of contract scopes/packages; 

d)	the procurement methods to be adopted, and indicating if the procurement tasks are to be outsourced as provided in Section 7.3.3 of this IRR;

e)	the time schedule for each procurement activity and for the contract implementation; and

f)	the estimated budget for the general components of the contract.”



Review of the Project Procurement Management Plans (PPMPs) and Annual Procurement Plan (APP) of the Iloilo State College of Fisheries – Main Campus revealed that the said documents are wanting of information and processes necessary to enable a meticulous and judicious planning. Below are the deficiencies noted (Annex R):



	a)	The PPMP was not supported with a documented market research to be able to gather information on the prevailing market prices of the items required by the project/program/activity so that an informed choice can be made in obtaining the most advantageous price for the government.



Interview with the personnel in charge revealed that no actual documentation was done in determining the estimated budget for some of the items required in the project/program/activity identified by the end-users. Prices set for all projects were culled out from previous offers of suppliers/contractors plus 10%, thus there is no assurance that prices set in the PPMP are the most advantageous on the part of the government.



	b)		The Schedule/ Milestone of Activities was not indicated in the PPMP, contrary to Section 7.3.4, Rule II of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184, hence, timelines for carrying out each step in the procurement process up to award of the contract were not established to serve as a guide in monitoring the procurement activities so that an efficient and effective delivery of services can be ensured.

	

	c)	The mode of procurement in the approved APP, submitted to the GPPB, and the Purchase Orders/Contracts were not traceable to the PPMP, as the PPMPs prepared by the end-users did not indicate the mode of procurement to be adopted, contrary to Section 7.3.4, Rule II of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184.



	In sampled procurement of goods and services totaling P7.258 million, the mode of procurement indicated in the APP and Purchase Orders/Contracts could not be traced to individual PPMPs as the PPMPs supporting the disbursements did not indicate the mode of procurement to be employed.

	

	d)		There was no specific method being adopted in the consolidation of PPMP into  APP, which will facilitate the establishment of a procurement strategy so that a cost-effective option can be made.

	

	Section 3 of the Generic Procurement Manual discusses on the strategies in consolidating PPMP into APP. Preparation of APP depends on the internal policy of the Procuring Entity. APP could be prepared by type such as making APP for goods, infrastructure, consulting services, CSE and Non-CSE or by mode of procurement, at the option of the PE. A well planned consolidation of PPMP to APP allows for the merging of similar project requirements under one contract or the division of a requirement into several contract packages so that the best value for money can be obtained.

	

	e)	A change in the mode of procurement from the original mode specified in the APP were not covered with a BAC Resolution recommending and justifying the reason for such change. Moreover, such changes were not reflected in the APP, contrary to Section 48.3, Rule XVI of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184.



Section 48.3, Rule XVI of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184, which provides: “The method of procurement to be used shall be as indicated in the approved APP. If the original method of procurement recommended in the APP was competitive bidding but cannot be ultimately pursued, the BAC, through a resolution, shall justify and recommend the change in the method of procurement to be approved by the HoPE. Such changes must be reflected in the APP to be submitted to the GPPB, pursuant to Section 7.4 of this IRR.”



Verification of sampled Purchase Orders/ Contracts revealed that out of P9.664 million total project cost, P4.642 million were procured adopting a different mode of procurement without the covering BAC Resolution duly approved by the HoPE.



	f)	The format and content of PPMP and APP were not in accordance with the required format under Section 3, Volume 1 of the Government Procurement Manual (GPM) issued by GPPB.



	The lack of relevant information rendered it difficult for the Audit Team to evaluate whether the items were actually needed by the end-users, timelines prescribed were met and procurement methods used were appropriate.

	Moreover, the above information is also necessary to provide comparison between actual performance and planned activities, which is a necessary tool for each Office in order to adjust the procurement plan accordingly.

		As a result of the above deficiencies, the usefulness of the Project Procurement Management Plan (PPMP) and the Annual Procurement Plan (APP) as  effective tools in procurement planning was not attained.

	

We recommended and the Management agreed to require the Implementing Units,  Procurement Unit and the BAC to:



	a)	Submit  justification on the deficiencies noted in audit;



b. Strictly adhere to the rules and regulations governing the formulation and revision of Project Procurement Management Plan (PPMP) and Annual Procurement Program (APP), in accordance with Section 7, Rule II of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules of R.A. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act and its Manual of Procedures, Volume 1 to enable a meticulous and judicious planning and a properly authorized procurement;



c. Adopt the prescribed processes and forms in the preparation and revision of PPMP and APP, to include milestone of activities, mode of procurement, description of projects and other relevant information as mandated by the Government Procurement Reform Act; 



d. Comply with the requirements of Section 48.3,  Rule XVI and Section 7.2, Rule II of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184 in cases where the original mode of procurement indicated in the APP cannot be ultimately pursued; and



e. Formulate a specific method to be employed in the consolidation of PPMP into the APP such as merging of similar project requirements under one contract regardless of fund sources as this will facilitate the establishment of a procurement strategy so that a cost-effective option can be made.

	

14. The rules and regulations embodied in Section 53.14 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act (GPRA) were not strictly adhered to, thus, propriety, economy and efficiency in the procurement of airline tickets amounting to P.781 million were not ensured.



The Government Procurement Policy Board confirmed, adopted, and approved the issuance of GPPB Resolution No. 024-2019 dated October 30, 2019, approving the inclusion of Section 53.14 in the 2016 revised IRR of RA No. 9184 (GPRA) on the direct retail purchase of airline tickets, among others, and the amendments to the affected provisions of its Annex “H” entitled “Consolidated Guidelines for the Alternative Methods of Procurement” " and made an integral part hereof.



 As a matter of policy, procurement of airline tickets shall be done through competitive bidding, except when the Procuring Entity has determined that Direct Retail Purchase is the best modality to be used, as may be warranted by circumstances.



Likewise, Annex H of the GPRA enumerates the conditions in using Direct Retail Purchase as mode of procurement, pertinent provisions of which state:



i)	Xxxxx



ii)	For airline tickets: 



a)		Direct purchase of airline tickets required for official travels within the fiscal year, including provisions for foreseeable emergencies based on historical records, shall be reflected in the APP in its entirety including any amendment thereto which shall be reflected in the supplemental APP; 



b)	Direct purchase must be made from any commercial airline at fairly reasonable rates, subject to flight availability at the time of booking, travel days, stopovers, routes, additional visa requirements and other reasonable considerations as determined by the end-user;



It was the practice of the management of ISCOF-Main Campus to procure all its airline tickets thru Direct Retail Purchase from travel agencies instead from commercial airline companies. Verification of disbursements on the payment of airfares for the period November 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020 disclosed the following: (Annex S)



				a)	Airline tickets of the officers and employees totaling P.614 million were procured from travel agencies, instead of direct purchase from commercial airlines companies, contrary to the above stated regulations;



	b)	Procurement of airfares through Negotiated Procurement - Direct Retail Purchase in the amount of  P.780 million was  neither reflected in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP) nor a resolution was issued by the BAC and the HoPE for their delegation of authority  in the conduct of direct retail purchase contrary to Sections 7.2  and 53.14 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act; and



	c)	Official receipts and plane tickets for airfare amounting to P103,193.98 and P194,570.52, respectively, are not attached to the claims,  thereby hindered  the verification of veracity of the total cost of the plane tickets as well as the breakdown of the airfare costs. 



As a result of the above deficiencies, propriety, economy and efficiency in the procurement of airline tickets were not ensured.



We recommended and the Management agreed to:



				a)		Require all College Personnel to strictly follow the guidelines on the procurement of airline tickets in accordance with Section 53.14 and Annex “H” of the 2016 Revised IRR of 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act; 

	

				b)		Direct the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) and the Procurement Unit to procure directly from commercial airlines all plane tickets in order to obtain the most advantageous price for the government;



				c)		Require the BAC to issue a resolution authorizing the delegation of officials and employees in the conduct of procurement of airline tickets, to be approved by the Head of Procuring Entity (HoPE);



				d)		Direct all Accountable Officers  to attach official receipts and plane tickets  to support veracity of airfares upon liquidation of cash advances on travel; and



				e)		Henceforth, direct the BAC Secretariat and the Procurement Unit to include in the Annual Procurement Plan the procurement of airline tickets and the modality to be adopted for propriety and authority.

15. Purchase Orders (POs) and other documents evidencing deliveries for the procurement of goods totaling P19.240 million lacked sufficient data/ information, contrary to COA Circular No. 96-010 dated August 15, 1996, hence strict enforcement of the POs could not be facilitated causing undue disadvantage to the College.



COA Circular 96-010 dated August 15, 1996 prescribe the guidelines in the preparation and submission of purchase orders relative to the procurement of supplies and equipment. It enumerates necessary information that POs must contain in order to facilitate proper procurement procedures. These data are vital to ensure that both parties are held accountable in accordance with the agreements.



Review of the 230 POs totaling P19.240 million disclosed that important information were not indicated and further verification of  documents supporting delivery of the items procured revealed  the following deficiencies below: (Annex T)

The absence of the aforementioned information resulted in the difficulty of determining whether or not there were violations on the agreed terms and conditions on the PO. For instance, liquidated damages could not be readily imposed since there was no date of delivery in the PO, delivery receipt or charge invoice was undated or not stamped received by the Supply Officer, thereby causing undue disadvantage to the College.



We recommended and the Management agreed to direct the Supply Officer to:



a)	Strictly comply with the provision of COA Circular 96-010  and Appendix 61 Volume II of GAM to facilitate the proper execution of procurement activities; and



b)	Ensure proper accomplishment of POs and other documents evidencing actual date of deliveries of procured items to ascertain that the stipulations in the PO are firmly observed.







16. Disbursements for Repairs and Maintenance totaling P.671 million in CY 2020 were paid without complete documentation, contrary to Section 4(6) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 as implemented by COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. Likewise, transactions totaling to P68,606.25 were procured through Direct Contracting, instead of Small Value Procurement (SVP), contrary to Annex H of the 2016 Revised IRR of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184. Hence, the validity, regularity and propriety of the transactions could not be established. 



Section 4 (6) of PD No. 1445 provides that, “claims against government fund shall be supported with complete documentation.”



Relevant thereto is Circular No. 2012-001 prescribing the Revised Guidelines and Documentary Requirements for Common Government Transactions. Item 9.1.3.4 of the  Circular enumerates the following documentary requirements for the repair and maintenance of equipment, motor vehicles and other facilities, among others:



--	Copy of the pre-repair evaluation report and approved detailed plans by the agency showing in sufficient details the scope of work/extent of repair to be done 

--	Report of waste materials

--	Copy of document indicating the history of repair

--	Post-inspection reports

--	Warranty Certificate

--	Request for payment

--	Bill/invoices

--	Certificate of Acceptance

--	Such other document peculiar to the contract and/or to the mode of procurement and which are considered necessary in the auditorial review and in the technical evaluation thereof.



Post-audit of transactions for the repair and maintenance expenses of ISCOF in CY 2020 covering 14 transactions amounting to P.671 million revealed that disbursements were not supported with complete documents as required by aforementioned circular. The following deficiencies noted are shown below: (Annex U)

The absence of the above documentation rendered it difficult to ascertain the following details:



--	Whether or not a thorough evaluation has been made to justify the repair;

--	Whether or not the items and/or services paid for were in accordance with the original approved repair request;

--	The frequency of the repairs made, as could have been provided by the document indicating the history of repairs;

--	Whether or not the repair done was acceptable to the College, which could have been provided by post-inspection reports; and

--	Legal technical and financial capabilities of the service providers who transacted with the College in CY 2020.

Likewise, it was observed that there was an instance wherein the alternative mode of procurement selected was inappropriate since Repairs and Maintenance amounting to P68,606.25 was procured through Direct Contracting instead of Small Value Procurement.



The foregoing deficiencies indicate weakness of internal control system considering that payments for such transactions were processed and paid without complete documentation, thus, cast doubts on the validity and propriety of the transactions.



We recommended and the Management agreed to:



a. Direct the College Accountant to submit the identified lacking documentary requirements per item 9.1.3.4 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 and the following mandatory requirements per Annex H of the 2016 Revised IRR of R.A. No. 9184:



1)	Mayors/Business Permit;

2)		PhilGEPS Registration Number; and

3)	Omnibus Sworn Statement.



b. 	Instruct the College Accountant to refrain from paying transactions not completely documented and validated pursuant to Item 6, Section 4 of PD No. 1445, and ensure that the required documents pursuant to COA Circular No. 2012-001 are attached to the disbursement vouchers to support the payments made.

17.  Propriety and validity of payments totaling P 72,145.00 for honoraria on National Service Training Program (NSTP) of teaching/non-teaching personnel at ISCOF Main Campus could not be ascertained due to the absence of valid and proper documents to support the disbursements, contrary to Section 28, Vol. I of the NGAs Manual and Section 2, Rule XVII of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of EO 292. 



Section 28, Volume I of the NGAs Manual provides the basic requirements applicable to all types of disbursements made by national government agencies that include, among others, the submission of proper evidence to establish the claim.



Section 2, Rule XVII of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of EO 292 provided that, “Each head of department or agency shall require a daily time record of attendance of all the officers and employees under him including those serving the field or on water to be kept in the proper form and whenever, possible, registered on a Bundy clock.”



Post-audit of transactions on the payments of NSTP honoraria of teaching/non-teaching personnel at ISCOF Main Campus totaling P72,145.00 for  the period January 1 to September 30, 2020  disclosed that daily time records or records of attendance of  NSTP Director, Instructors and Administrative Staff were not submitted as supporting documents to the transactions, to wit:

Relative to the above claims of honoraria, it is imperative that these should be supported with proper and valid supporting documents. The use of bundy clock/finger prints recognition data entry or similar mechanical devices to record attendance could have been a deterrent to the above deficiencies noted. As a result, propriety and validity of payments for honoraria amounting to P72,145.00  could not be ascertained.



We recommended and the Management agreed that the concerned personnel strictly comply with Section 2, Rule XVII of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of EO 292 on the use of mechanical equipment, if circumstances warrant, for the recording of attendance or records of attendance and submit the same to serve as proper evidence to establish the claim.



18.  Reimbursable RATA amounting to P.743 million granted to ISCOF Main officials and Campus Administrator of ISCOF Barotac Nuevo Campus were charged to the Representation Expense (5 02 99 030 00) and Transportation and Delivery Expense (5 02 99 040 00) contrary to the provisions of Section 4(1) and 112 of P.D. No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 28, 2020, resulting in inappropriate use of funds and casting doubt on the validity and propriety of the claim. 



	COA Circular 2020-001 dated January 28, 2020, defined Representation Allowance (5 01 02 020) as an account used to record monthly representation allowance granted to authorized officials and employees in the actual performance of their respective functions, both commutable and reimbursable. Transportation Allowance (5 01 02 030) is used to record monthly transportation allowance granted to authorized officials and employees in the actual performance of their respective functions, both commutable and reimbursable.

	

	The same Circular also describes Representation Expense, Account Code 5 02 99 030, as an account used to record expenses incurred for official meetings/conferences/entertainments. Transportation and Delivery Expenses, on the other hand, Account Code 5 02 99 040 is used to record the cost of transporting goods/merchandise sold in the course of business operations. This includes the cost of moving agency’s own people and properties from one station to another.

	

	Representation and Transportation Allowance (RATA) should be sourced from the Personnel Services (PS) allotment. However, examination of the transactions relating to RATA as of September 30, 2020 revealed that reimbursable RATA was charged to Representation Expense and Transportation and Delivery Expense (RETE) and sourced from the MOOE allotment contrary to Section 112 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 which states that, “Each Government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations conformably with general accepted accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations.” Additionally, Section 4(1) of the same regulation states that no money shall be paid out of any public treasury or deposit except in pursuance of an appropriation law or other specific authority. Therefore, charging of reimbursable RATA to RETE Accounts amounting to P.743 million for the College Officials of ISCOF System (Annex V) was improper and caused the Representation Expenses and Transportation and Delivery Expenses to be overstated in the financial statements. 

	

	It was noted for CY 2020 that the College was compliant with the requirements per Section 4 of NBC No. 404, dated March 29, 1989 for entitlement to RATA. Verification of the approved budget for CY 2020 of ISCOF revealed that only the RATA of the President and the Chief Administrative Officer were included in the budget for RATA. Post-audit of RATA disclosed that the budget for the RATA of Vice-Presidents, Financial Management Officer and the three Campus Directors: the Directors for Extension Services Community Development, Research and Development and Office of Student Affairs were sourced from Funds 101 and 164-MOOE allotment in accordance to Section 13.1.1 of NBC Circular No. 548 dated May 15, 2013, which states that, “The amounts required for the grant of commutable or reimbursable RATA  to incumbents or OICs of regular positions and to designated officials in SUCs shall be charged to the respective agency appropriations/budgets for the purpose. In case of deficiencies, the same shall be charged against agency savings.” 

	

	Although the RATA were sourced from Fund 101 and the use of income from Fund 164, the account code to be used should be RATA (5 01 02 020) and (5 01 02 030), respectively, and should be sourced from the PS allotment and not from the MOOE for proper classification of the account.



We recommended and Management agreed to require:



a)	The Budget Officer to institute tighter control measures to ascertain that government obligations are charged appropriately against the respective budget for proper and correct reporting; and



b)	The Accountant to charge reimbursable RATA to proper account as per COA Circular 2020-001 dated January 28, 2020.



19.  The College did not maintain separate set of books for the Trust Receipt (FC 07) in accordance with Fund Cluster (FC) Accounting as prescribed by the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies, thus, transactions for the said fund were classified and recorded under FC 05 (Internally Generated Funds) resulting in the overstatement of the account balances under FC 05.

	

Section 6, GAM for NGAs, Volume 1, provides the Basic Government Accounting and Budget Reporting Principles that National Government Agencies are mandated to conform to in recognizing and presenting its financial transactions and operations, one of which is the fund cluster accounting. Each entity of the National Government shall maintain complete set of accounting books by fund cluster.



Moreover, Sec. 13 of the same manual states:  “Fund Accounting.  The books of accounts shall be maintained by fund cluster as follows:   



Code 	Description



01 	Regular Agency Fund 

02 	Foreign Assisted Projects Fund 

03 	Special Account-Locally Funded/Domestic Grants Fund 

04 	Special Account-Foreign Assisted/Foreign Grants Fund 

05 	Internally Generated Funds 

06 	Business Related Funds

07 	Trust Receipts 



		The composition of fund clusters is enumerated in Annex P of GAM Volume 1.”







	ISCOF External Campuses maintains only three sets of accounting books, namely:



FUNDS PER ISCOF BOOKS

PER FUND CLUSTER

a.  Fund 101	

General Fund

Fund Cluster 01

Regular Agency Fund 

b.  Fund 164

General Income

Fund Cluster 05

Internally Generated Funds

c.  Fund 161

Income Generating Fund



Fund Cluster 06

Business Related Funds

		

		Review of the bank accounts maintained by the College revealed that all funds received from sponsoring government agencies for various projects and financial assistance to students were deposited in Fund 164- General Income/Internally Generated Fund instead of Fund Cluster 07- Trust Receipts Fund. A separate bank account is not used and maintained to facilitate transactions covered under FC 07 such as inter-Agency Transferred Funds (IATF) for scholarship grants and donations as well as project funds from sourced agencies.  With the implementation of IPSAS, Unified Accounts Code Structure (UACS) and GAM, the College is expected to maintain a separate accounting book for trust receipts.

		

		The non-maintenance of separate books overstated the account balances under FC 05 by the amount accruing to the trust receipts and is not compliant with IPSAS and GAM requirements. Fund 164 is used to record income of the College from tuition fees and all other authorized school fees as well as all disbursements related thereto. Evidently, collections for trusts receipts should not be recorded in the books of the General Income or Internally Generated Funds.

		

Management commented that they will maintain a separate book of accounts for FC 07 - Trust Receipts in accordance with the requirement for fund cluster accounting and will  process the opening of a separate bank account for trust receipts starting CY January 2021.

		

		We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	Require the Accountant to maintain separate books of accounts for FC 07 - Trust Receipts in accordance with the requirement for fund cluster accounting; and



b)	Make representations and request approval from the Board of Trustees to open and maintain a separate bank account for trust receipts.

	

20.  Delayed submission of Disbursement Vouchers, contrary to COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995, resulted in the difficulty of ascertaining the legality and validity of the transactions.



COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 states:



	6.05 “The official involved in the daily recording of transactions in the books of accounts shall turn over the receipts and the disbursement records with all the paid vouchers and documents evidencing the transaction to the Auditor within ten (10) days from the receipt of said documents.”



Audit of disbursements revealed that there were repetitive delays in the submission of disbursement vouchers and their supporting documents. The status of submission of disbursements vouchers for all funds as of January 31, 2021 is shown in Annex W.

		

	According to the officials concerned at the Accounting Office, the reasons for delayed submission of disbursement vouchers were the following: a) lack of personnel to sort out copy of disbursement voucher for submission to the Audit Team; b) inadequate supporting documents; and c) lack of signature of concerned officials. Moreover, submission of DVs were not made on time because there were instances that official receipts from suppliers took time to be transmitted to the Cashier's Office, especially payments through LDDAP and suppliers were located outside the region. Such circumstance hindered  the Cashier's Office to transmit to the Accounting Office the set of paid vouchers as they made sure that these DVs were supported with official receipts.

	

Delayed submission of disbursement vouchers and their corresponding supporting documents resulted in the difficulty of ascertaining the legality and validity of the transactions, contrary to COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995 and precluded the timely conduct of post-audit and consequently, prevented the early detection and correction of errors and deficiencies as well as the timely reporting of the audit results to the Management. 



In ISCOF Main Campus, an additional employee was already assigned at the Accounting Office to take care of the submission of the DVs to the Audit Team.



We recommended and the Management agreed to:



a)	Enforce strict adherence by the Accountant on the timely submission of Disbursement Vouchers within the reglementary period to COA Resident Auditor, pursuant to Sections 122 and 127 of P.D. 1445 and COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995; and



b)	Take appropriate actions against concerned officials and employees for the repeated failure to adhere to regulations on the prompt submission of reports.



21.  Non-compliance of Iloilo State College of Fisheries to Gender and Development (GAD) pertinent provisions of Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) and Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Joint Circular No. 2012-01 and PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 2021, defeated the intent of the program to pursue women’s empowerment, gender responsiveness and gender equality.

		

	Section 2.3 of Joint Circular No. 2012-01 of the PCW, NEDA and DBM provides that,

	

	 “Pursuant to the Magna Carta for Women (MCW) and the General Appropriations Act (GAA), all government departments, including their attached agencies, offices, bureaus, state universities and colleges (SUCs), government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs), local government units (LGUs) and other government instrumentalities shall formulate their annual GPBs within the context of their mandates to mainstream gender perspectives  in their policies, programs and projects. GAD Planning shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, the cost of implementation of which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their total budget. The computation and utilization shall be implemented in accordance with the specific guidelines provided therein.”

	

Further, Section 6.4 of the same Circular provides that attribution to the GAD budget of a portion or the whole of the budget of an agency’s major programs is a means toward gradually increasing the gender responsiveness of government programs and budgets. If an agency intends to attribute a portion or the whole budget of major programs during the GAD planning and budgeting phase, it may subject the program to gender analysis using the HGDG tool. If the agency is not yet trained on the use of the tool, it may include said training in its GPB and may seek the assistance of an expert on gender analysis using the HGDG.



Moreover, PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 provides the guidelines on the Submission of FY 2020 GAD Accomplishment Report.

	

Verification made on the implementation and compliance as well as disbursement of Gender and Development (GAD) activities revealed the following audit observations:



							a)		The actual cost incurred for the GAD amounting to P207,190.76 or .0765% of the total appropriation of P270.637 million and 1.53% of the authorized allocation for GAD activities of P13.530 million was less than the authorized 5% as required in Section 31 of the General Provisions in FY 2020 GAA. The detailed schedule of GAD Accomplishment Report is attached as Annex A  and is summarized in the table below:

							b)				The CY 2020 GAD AR showed that 66.67% of programs, activities and projects (PAPs) identified in the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for CY 2020 were not implemented as of year-end.

			

Review of the GPB as presented in the Annual GAD AR showed that there were ten gender issues presented of which three focused on its clientele while seven to the organization. Its AR revealed that only one of its planned activities was implemented for an actual cost of P33,849.00 while two gender issues focused on organization were implemented for an actual cost of P173,341.76. As a result, the GAD plan and its actual cost incurred did not meet the required 5% as provided in the GAA for FY 2020. The rate clearly indicates that the College’s GAD PAPs to address the gender issues were barely utilized.



	c. The major PAPs attributed to GAD were not subjected to gender analysis using the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) tool, thus assessment of  gender-responsiveness of the implementation of the program/project could not be done.

	

The College’s PAPs budget for CY 2020 amounted to P13.530 million. The two activities in the GPB were client-focused and organization-focused. The organization-focused GAD activities which amounted to P11.390 million constituted 84.18% of the total budget, while the remaining P2.140 million or 15.82% of the total GAD budget was for client-focused activities.



For purposes of attribution of major PAPs to GAD, PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 requires that agencies shall assess the gender-responsiveness of its implementation using the HGDG tool in order to determine the actual expenditures that maybe attributed to GAD. The non-preparation of the HGDG tool, despite minimal GAD expenditures for CY 2020, precluded the verification and evaluation of the amounts attributed to GAD in relation to the responsiveness of the GAD-attributed PAPs to existing gender issues of the College.



As a result of the foregoing deficiencies, the non-implementation of the GAD PAPs in the GPB and non-compliance to the pertinent provisions of PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 and PCW MC No. 2021-01 affected the attainment of the goal of the College in pursuing women’s empowerment and promoting gender-responsiveness and equality.



According to Management, due to COVID-19 Pandemic in CY 2020 most of the activities were not implemented as planned, however there were series of webinars conducted by the College for their employees and students. Moreover, they shall undertake relevant webinars/trainings intended for the GFPS on how to do gender mainstreaming, use of HGDG tools, gender audit and other related concepts to properly assess the gender-responsiveness of the College.



We recommended and the Management agreed to: 

		

		a. Ensure that GAD Plan and Budget shall be in consonance with the provision of the GAA requiring at least 5% of their budget integrated in their regular activities;

		

a)		Require the GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) to ensure that GAD PAPs are implemented as planned to attain the GAD objectives; and

	

c. Require the GFPS to undertake gender analysis using the HGDG tool to properly assess the gender-responsiveness of its proposed PAPs to the College’s existing gender issues and for purposes of attribution of major programs or projects to GAD, pursuant to PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01. 



22.  Audit disallowances were not settled despite the issuance of Notices of Finality of Decision (NFD) and COA Orders of Execution (COE), contrary to Section 7.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, resulting in undue accumulation of unsettled disallowances amounting to P5.995 million as of December 31, 2020.



Pursuant to Section 7.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, the responsibilities of the agency head in audit and settlement of accounts include the following:



“7.1.1 The head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: xxx (b) the settlement of disallowances and charges are made within the prescribed period; xxx.

	

			7.1.2 The head of the Agency shall initiate the necessary administrative and/or criminal action in case of unjustified failure/refusal to effect compliance with the foregoing requirements by subordinate officials. Xxx

	

	7.1.3 He shall enforce the COA Order of Execution (COE) by requiring the withholding of salaries or other compensation due the person liable in satisfaction of the disallowance or charge.



		7.1.4 He shall ensure that all employees who are retiring or transferring to other   agencies shall first settle the disallowances and charges for which they are liable.”



		It is stated as instructions to the Agency Head, the Accountant and the persons liable in the Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) that the persons liable shall pay the disallowed amount immediately to the Agency Cashier. Non settlement of the ND shall authorize the Agency Cashier to withhold payment of salary and other money due to persons liable in accordance with the COE to be issued to the Agency Cashier.

		

In the COE, the Agency Head is instructed to withhold the payment of the salaries or any amount due to persons liable, for the settlement of their liabilities pursuant to the ND/Decision related thereto. Payment of salaries or any money due them in violation of this instruction will be disallowed in audit and the agency head will be held liable therefor.



Monitoring on the settlement of the Notice of Disallowance (ND) of ISCOF-Main Campus which became final and executory revealed the following summary: (See Annex X for details)



No. of NDs with NFD

1.52%



It was observed that out of 41 NDs issued with NFD and COE, only 11 were partially settled and the remaining 30 NDs are still outstanding. As gleaned in the above table, only 1.52% of the total disallowed amount was settled.



It is noted that these NDs were not subjected to any request for installment of settlement, and so, the payment of salaries or any amount due to persons liable should be withheld until full settlement in consonance with the instructions in the COE. 



The Agency Cashier failed to withhold the salaries and any amount due to persons liable. Thus, this indicated laxity in enforcing the settlement of all these long-outstanding audit disallowances. 



However, it is worthy to mention that the College President issued a Memorandum No. 04-03 s. 2021 dated April 5, 2021, requesting for a status of compliance to the said observation, but as of April 30, 2021, outstanding balance of these disallowances remained unsettled.



The non-settlement of the disallowances which have become final and executory and the lack of Management’s enforcement for settlement resulted in undue accumulation of the balance to P5.995 million as of December 31, 2020.



Non-settlement of disallowances within the prescribed period after it has become final and executory shall be a ground for administrative disciplinary action against the officer or employee concerned and retention of money of persons liable for satisfaction of indebtedness to government. Section 37 of P.D. No. 1445 states that:



		“Retention of money for satisfaction of indebtedness to government. – When any person is indebted to any government agency, the commission may direct the officer to withhold the payment of any money due such person or his estate to be applied in satisfaction of the indebtedness.”

		

We recommended and the Management agreed to:



a)		Submit justifications and explanations for non-compliance to NFDs and COEs issued by the Commission;

		

b)		Enforce the immediate settlement of the disallowances pursuant to the pertinent provisions of the 2009 RRSA and P.D. No. 1445;



c)		Initiate sending of notice/letter of demand to persons liable to settle their disallowances especially those who are no longer employees of the College; and



d)			Make a written request for installment payment of disallowances in accordance with COA Resolution 2017-021 dated November 3, 2017.

		

Compliance with Tax Laws

	

23. Taxes of ISCOF Main and Dingle Campuses were not withheld from remunerations paid to Job Order Personnel, contrary to Section 79(A) of Republic Act 8424, as amended, or the Tax Reform Act of 1997, thus depriving the government of additional revenue which could have been collected from the taxpayers.

	

Republic Act (RA) 8424, otherwise known as the “Tax Reform Act of 1997”, as further amended by RA 9504, states: 



“Section 79. Income Tax Collected at Source- (A) Requirement of Withholding. – Except in the case of a minimum wage earner as defined in Section 22(HH) of this Code, every employer making payment of wages shall deduct and withhold upon such wages a tax determined in accordance with the rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of Finance, upon recommendation of the Commissioner.”



Moreover, Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 130-2016 dated December 8, 2016 was issued to clarify the withholding taxes imposed in income payments by departments and agencies of the government to individuals whose services are engaged under a contract of service of job order arrangement.



Verification of disbursements showed that the Accountant failed to deduct corresponding withholding taxes from the remunerations totaling P457,331.62 received by the following: (Annex Y)

	The Accountant has been religiously withholding and remitting the taxes on time as provided under pertinent rules and regulations of the BIR except for the several JO personnel of ISCOF Main and Dingle Campuses who did not file the required annual sworn statement and pay the annual registration fee as self-employed individuals. 

	

	Non-compliance on the part of the JO personnel requires the Accountant to withhold 3% percentage tax from their remunerations on which the Accountant inadvertently failed to deduct. 

	

	The non-withholding of taxes from remuneration paid to Job Order Personnel by the Head of the Agency and the Accountant who are charged with the duty to deduct and withhold any internal revenue tax and remit the same in accordance with the provision of National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of the Philippines, deprived the national government of income for its programs and projects. It also exposed the College to the risk of paying tax penalties, interests and surcharges.

	

According to Management, the Job Order Personnel of ISCOF Main Campus whom no withholding tax was deducted from their wages were hired by the College in the last quarter of CY 2020. Consequently, before processing their first wage, they have been instructed by the Accounting Office to register with the BIR and submit the required Sworn Declaration for them to be exempted from withholding tax, which they have agreed also. However, the Accountant had missed out deducting withholding tax from the wages of Job Order Personnel who failed to comply with the requirements and the deficiency was only found out later this January 2021. Likewise, the Accountant of ISCOF-Dingle Campus leniently considered not deducting withholding tax on the wages of their job order personnel due to the decreased wages as result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The management has already required the Job Order Personnel to register with the BIR and submit their sworn declaration, otherwise, withholding tax shall be deducted from their wages starting January 2021.

	We recommended and the Management agreed to direct the Accountant to strictly comply with the BIR rules and regulations, on the proper imposition of tax obligations of employees, for the withholding of applicable taxes on remuneration paid and observe timely remittance thereof.

	

	

	

	Compliance with R.A. No. 8291

24. It is noteworthy to mention that the College remitted the deductions of GSIS Premium from salaries of employees in accordance with R.A. No. 8291.

	Compliance with Expanded Senior Citizen Act of 2010 and Magna Carta for  Disabled Person

25. The College did not formulate and appropriate funds for the implementation of     activities beneficial to the Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability in violation of Republic Act Nos. 9994 and 7277, respectively, and Section 32 of the General Appropriations Act for FY 2020.



Republic Act No. 9994 other known as the “Expanded Senior Citizen Act of 2010” and Republic Act No. 7277 known and cited as  the “Magna Carta for Disabled Person, were enacted to establish mechanisms whereby the contributions of the senior citizens to nation building are maximized, to motivate and encourage the senior citizens to contribute to nation building and to give full support for the improvement of the total well-being of the disabled persons and their integration to the mainstream of society. 



Section 32 of GAA FY 2020. Programs and Projects Related to Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability provides that, “All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.

	

Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and R.A. No. 7277, as amended.”



The Audit Team observed that ISCOF had not formulated a comprehensive plan and appropriate funds for CY 2020 that would lead to the achievement of programs and projects related to Senior Citizens and PWD. 



Interview with the Vice President for Administrative Affairs of ISCOF Main Campus disclosed that they have not yet formulated programs/projects/activities and did not set aside funds for the implementation of activities for the welfare of the senior citizens and differently-abled persons as prescribed under the above-mentioned laws. This area of concern has been overlooked by management since its inclusion in the GAA.



In addition, due to the COVID-19 outbreak the College was not able to integrate activities beneficial to Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability. However, the management had allowed the College's senior citizen personnel to work from home instead of physical reporting considering their health conditions during this pandemic. The college is also incorporating on its infrastructure projects provision of ramps and other means that would be beneficial to the senior citizens and persons with disability.



The elderly and the disabled persons could have acquired the assistance and benefits of improving their well-being had the agency formulated programs/projects/activities and appropriated necessary funds for their welfare and integrated the same in their regular activities. 



We recommended and the Management agreed that the College integrate in their annual plans and programs activities for the welfare of the senior citizens and the persons with disability and allocate budget for the implementation of these activities in compliance with R.A. Nos. 9994 and 7277.
