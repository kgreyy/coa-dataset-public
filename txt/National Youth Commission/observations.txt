OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Financial Audit 
 

Non-reversion of unreleased and stale checks - ₱291,176.88  

 

1. Unreleased and stale checks as of December 31, 2020 totaling ₱291,176.88, 
were not reverted back to the cash account and correspondingly did not 

recognize the appropriate liability account, contrary to Section 56, Chapter 19, 

Volume 1 of the GAM for NGAs, affecting the fair presentation of the Cash in 

Bank –LCCA and Accounts Payable accounts. 

 

Section 56, Chapter 19, Volume I of GAM for NGAs provides that “all 

unreleased checks at the end of the year shall be reverted back to the cash accounts. 

A JEV shall be prepared to recognize the restoration of the cash equivalent to the 

unreleased checks and the recognition of the appropriate liability/payable account. 

The accounting entry for the restoration of the unreleased check to the cash account 

shall be a debit to “Cash in Bank, LCCA” account with credit to the appropriate 

liability account. The JEV supporting such restoration shall form part of the 

supporting document to the financial statements to be submitted to COA at year 

end.” 

 

Review of the January to December 2020 Bank Reconciliation Statement 

(BRS) of the agency’s LBP Local Currency- Current Account (LCCA) No. 0662-

1031-01, and comparison of cash reports and records showed that at year-end, 

processed checks totaling ₱266,456.07 were still in the Cashier’s possession or 

remained unreleased to the payees. Details are as follows:

Total 266,456.07 

 

These checks were reported as reconciling items in the December 2020 BRS 

and were included in the Cashier’s submitted Summary List of Unreleased Checks 

as of December 31, 2020. However, further verification of records disclosed that 

these unreleased checks were not in the list or subsidiary ledger of Accounts 

Payable as of year-end. 

 

Moreover, the year-end BRS’ reconciling items also included a stale check 

(Check No. 385322) dated April 14, 2020 amounting to ₱24,720.81. The Cashier 

already reported the same as cancelled; however, it was also not adjusted back to 

the agency’s cash account. 

 

The non-restoration of unreleased and stale checks to the cash account 

affected the fair presentation of the Cash in Bank – LCCA and Accounts Payable 

accounts in the Agency’s financial statements. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant to ensure that all unreleased and stale checks at year-end be 

restored back to the Agency’s Cash in Bank – LCCA account, and  

correspondingly set up the Accounts Payable account.  

 

Management informed the Audit Team that the unreleased checks were 

released in January 2021 and the stale check was already restored back to the cash 

account. 

 

 

Misclassified Inventory and PPE accounts - ₱141,046.00 and non-impairment 

provision for unserviceable properties ₱9,352.75 

 

2. Inventories and PPE  totaling ₱141,046.00 with capitalization threshold below 
₱15,000 were not recognized as semi-expendable properties; while non-

impairment provision was not recognized for unserviceable properties with an 

aggregate book value of ₱9,352.75, thus, affecting the fair presentation of the 

affected accounts in the financial statements.

The IPSAS 1 provides that financial statements shall be presented fairly. "Fair 

presentation requires the faithful presentation of the effects of transactions, other 

events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for 

assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the IPSASs.” 

 

Analysis of the OSMI, OE, and ICTE accounts and the related transactions of 

the NYC revealed the following errors and deficiencies: 

 

(a) Misclassified Inventory and PPE accounts costing ₱141,046.00 
 

Relevant provisions on Semi-expendable Property under Chapter 8, Volume I 

of the GAM for NGAs are the following: 

 

Sec. 10. Semi-expendable Property. Tangible items below the 

capitalization threshold of ₱15,000 shall be accounted as semi-

expendable property. The following policies apply as follows: 
 

a. Semi-expendable property which were recognized as PPE shall 
be reclassified to the affected accounts. 

 

b. These tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon 
issue to the end-user. 

 

Sec. 11. Accountability over Semi-expendable Property. Inventory 

Custodian Slip (ICS) (Appendix 59) shall be issued to end-user of 

Semi-expendable Property to establish accountability over them. 

xxx 
 

Review of Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) and DVs 

disclosed that 51 items totaling P141,046.00  with capitalization below P15,000.00  

each item were erroneously recognized as equipment and inventory instead as semi-

expendable properties, to wit:

(b) Non-impairment of unserviceable properties with an aggregate book value of 
₱9,352.75 

 

Section 40 (d), Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides that “all 

unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of 

Unserviceable Property (IIRUP). PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from 

the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the 

PPE less Accumulated Depreciation).” 

 

It was noted in the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and 

Equipment (RPCPPE) as of December 31, 2020, the existence of unserviceable 

properties segregated and presented under “For Disposal (IIRUP)” caption 

amounting to ₱187,055.00.  

 

According to the Accountant, these properties have long been idle/abandoned, 

fully-depreciated, and awaiting disposal. The Audit Team was provided the IIRUP, 

which showed the composition, as follows: 

 

Particulars Qty Total Cost 
Accumulated 

Depreciation 
Book Value 

Various CPUs 4 73,156.00 69,498.20 3,657.80

Grand Total  187,055.00 177,702.25 9,352.75 
 Note: The IIRUP revealed that these items have been set-apart since 2019. 

 

Non-impairment of these fully-depreciated, idle, and unserviceable equipment 

affected the fair presentation of the OE and ICTE accounts. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the:  

 

a. Chief Accountant to prepare the following adjusting entries for the:

B. Compliance Audit 
 

Non-conformity with CSC-COA-DBM rulings on hiring COS/JOs  

 

3. NYC hired a total of 51 Contract of Service/Job Orders (COS/JOs), with a 
total salary of ₱8,923,561.43 for CY 2020, whose: (a) responsibilities or job 

descriptions are similar to those performed by the regular employees; and (b) 

contracts were renewed during the pandemic when PAPs were 

shelved/deferred, contrary to Sections 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 of CSC-COA-DBM JC 

No. 1, series of 2017. Moreover, the Agency may not have been prudent in 

spending government funds.  

  

The pertinent provisions of the CSC-COA-DBM JC No. 1, series of 2017 are 

the following: 

 

7.1  Hiring under contract of service shall be limited to consultants, 

learning service providers, and/or other technical experts to 

undertake special project or job within a specific period. The 

project or job is not part of the regular functions of the 

Agency, or the expertise is not available in the Agency, or it is 

impractical or more expensive for the government agency to 

directly undertake the service provided by the individual or 

institutional contractor. 



 

33 

 

 

 

7.2  Hiring of Job Order workers shall be limited to emergency or 

intermittent work, such as clearing of debris on the roads, 

canals, waterways, etc. after natural/ man-made 

disasters/occurrences; other trades and crafts, and manual 

tasks such as carpentry, plumbing, painting, electrical, and the 

like which are not part of the regular functions of the Agency. 

 

7.3  Contract of service and job order workers should not, in any 

case, be made to perform functions which are part of the job 

description of the Agency’s existing regular employees. 

 

NYC hired 51 COS/JO personnel, equivalent to 62 percent of the total filled-

up plantilla positions as at December 31, 2020, a decrease of 8 from the 59  

COS/JOs hired in CY 2019. 

 

As of December 31, 2019, NYC had 43 unfilled plantilla positions. To 

augment the lack of manpower, the Agency resorted to hiring COS/JOs whose 

salaries were charged under MOOE - Other Professional Services Expense account. 

Audit of the contracts and accomplishment reports of these COS/JOs revealed the 

following: 

 

(a) COS/JOs’ job descriptions and accomplishments were similar to those 
performed by the regular employees 

  

Verification of the contracts and accomplishment reports of these COS/JOs 

disclosed that their works were administrative, clerical, technical and other 

functions similar to those being performed by the regular employees. Details are as 

follows: 

 

Job Descriptions/ Functions 
Nos. of hired COS/JOs 

CY 2019 CY 2020 

Administrative/ clerical works 55 47 

Technical functions 2 2 

Training facilitators and other similar functions 2 2 

Total 59 51 

 

Comparison of the contracts vis-a-vis the accomplishment reports attached to 

the salary claims of COS/JOs, particularly during the quarantine period, showed 

that the contracted activities were not performed, and that: 

 

a. there was overlapping/duplication of work among the COS/JOs; 
 

b. the Accomplishment reports listed the same activities in every reporting 
period without comprehensible output; and 

 



 

34 

 

 

c. most of the COS/JOs’ accomplishment reports had the same activities e.g., 
attended flag ceremony, updated and forwarded Individual Weekly 

Accomplishment Report (IWAR), acknowledged email, answered phone 

calls, submitted electronic Daily Time Record (DTR), which are clerical in 

nature considering that they were hired because of their technical 

expertise. 

 

These job descriptions and accomplishments do not meet the criteria or 

limitations provided under Sections 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 as the COS/JOs were hired to 

accomplish and have been performing functions that are similar to the job 

description of the existing regular employees. More so, the contracted activities are 

not being performed, which meant that the hiring of these COS/JOs is 

inappropriate/not justifiable. 

  

(b) COS/JOs contracts were renewed during the pandemic when PAPs were 
shelved/deferred 

 

Following the proper protocol for the COVID-19 pandemic led by Inter-

Agency Task Force (IATF), all the NYC-targeted PAPs were either shelved or 

deferred because most of their PAPs demanded physical attendance of the youth. 

Consequently, the individual/division targets were predominantly not accomplished 

in CY 2020. 

 

However, despite limited implementation of PAPs due to COVID-19, the 

NYC continuously hired and renewed the contracts of COS/JOs. As at December 

31, 2020, there are 46 COS/JOs in NYC, with the following details: 

 

PAPs/Division No. of COS/JOs 

Sangguniang Kabataan related PAPs / RYDD 20 

Office of the Chairperson and CEO (OCCEO)* 7 

End Local Communist Armed Conflict (ELCAC)-related PAPs / 

OCCEO 

3 

Youth Organization Registration Program / OCCEO 2 

Office of the Commissioner Representing Luzon (OCRL)* 1 

Luzon Youth Agenda (LYA) PAPs / OCRL 1 

Philippine Anti-Drugs Strategy (PADS) related PAPs / Planning, 
Monitoring and Evaluation Division (PMED) 

1 

Office of the Executive Director (OED)* 5 

Administrative and Finance Division (AFD)* 5 

Policy Research Division (PRD)* 1 

Total 46 
 Note: (*) not assigned to a particular PAP 

 

To utilize the COS/JOs, Management contemplated on webinar or online 

training in lieu of face-to-face activities. However,, these changes in PAPs were 

only verbally requested for approval and no written or formal supplemental PAPs 



 

35 

 

 

were prepared. As a result, the Audit Team could not verify if the proper authority 

approved these changes. 

  

Conducted interview disclosed that aside from the reason that the Agency 

hired these COS/JOs to augment the lack of manpower, their employment during 

the pandemic was also for humanitarian reason and to de-escalate the number of 

unemployed Filipinos during the pandemic. 

 

Management further explained that the COS/JOs are needed to assist the 

existing plantilla personnel in carrying out the Agency’s planned projects and 

activities while waiting for the permanent positions to be filled up. 

 

As a result, instead of a drop in the number of COS/JOs being hired as a 

consequence of deferred PAPs, it decreased only by 8 personnel – from 59 in CY 

2019 to 51 in CY 2020. This is also evident in these personnel’s recorded salaries, 

which showed a decrease of only ₱1,739,727.83, as presented below:  

 

CY 2020 

(Pandemic) 

CY 2019 

(Pre-pandemic) 

Increase 

(Decrease) 

8,923,561.43 10,663,289.26 (1,739,727.83) 

 

 

Based on the Audit Team’s review and analysis, it appeared that the 

employment of the COS/JOs was partly for humanitarian reason; hence, the Agency 

may not have been prudent in spending government funds. 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. advise the Human Resource Merit Promotion and Selection Board 
(HRMPSB) to: 

 

i. exert more effort in filling up the vacant plantilla positions; 
hence, the hiring of COS/JOs will ease off; and 

 

ii. ensure that assigned tasks or job descriptions of COS/JOs are 
not similar to those being performed by the regular employees 

and limit only to the works/jobs mentioned under Section 7.1 

and 7.2 of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, series of 

2017; and 

 

b. require the COS/JOs’ superiors to ensure that assigned and 
performed jobs are aligned with the contracted activities of the 

COS/JO personnel. 

 

The Agency has been on track in requesting additional plantilla positions to 

cover other areas/functions that were not considered in the Institutional 



 

36 

 

 

Strengthening initiative. Moreover, the draft Guidelines on the hiring of the COS 

personnel has been revisited and will be endorsed to appropriate approving bodies 

of the NYC to ensure that the engagement of COS personnel will be in accordance 

with the existing rules and regulations while taking into consideration the 

competency and qualification requirement of the COS position/s to be filled. Said 

guidelines provide the process and requirements in filling the COS positions. 

 

Management further commented that the Agency is in the process of 

preparing to implement the provisions of the NYC SPMS among the COS 

personnel to ensure the alignment of performance against set objectives and targets 

while simultaneously serving as a process by which their performance will be 

evaluated and rated according to the contracted services. 

 

C. Other Areas 
 

Dormant Accounts  

 

4. The ₱138,844.18 balance of the Other Receivable account had been inactive for 
over 15 years. These accounts, which pertained to unsettled cash advances of 10 

former employees of the Agency, were requested for write-off in CY 2019 but were 

denied due to lacking documents. 

 

 

Gender and Development Program (GAD) 

 

5. NYC formulated plans and programs for GAD for CY 2020 and incurred total 
expenses of ₱7,083,570.75 pursuant to Section 31 of the General Provisions 

(GP) of RA No. 11465 or the General Appropriation Act (GAA) for Fiscal 

Year 2020. 

 

Section 31 of the GP of RA No. 11465 states that “all agencies of the 

government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within 

their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under 

R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women. The GAD Plan shall be integrated 

into the agencies’ regular activities, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their 

budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which 

relates to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic 

empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and 

fulfilment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance 

are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement.” 

 

Evaluation of the submitted GAD Accomplishments for CY 2020 showed that 

of the 12 planned activities, eight were executed and that NYC spent a total of 

₱7,083,570.75 or 5.89 percent of the CY 2020 GAA of ₱120,276,000.00. Most of 

the activities were performed online, and as a result, the Agency did not incur a 



 

37 

 

 

cost. Moreover, due to the pandemic, three of the planned activities were not 

accomplished.  The details are as follows:

6. For CY 2020, NYC had formulated plans and conducted activities related to Senior 
Citizens and Persons with Disability (PWDs) pursuant to Section 32 of the GP of 

RA No. 11465. 

 

Section 32 of the GP of RA No. 11465 provides that all agencies of the 
government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the 



 

38 

 

 

concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their 

mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities. 

 

For CY 2020, NYC had allotted ₱250,000.00 for its plans, projects and 

activities to address concerns of senior citizens (SCs) and PWDs, as shown below:

Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) and Climate Change Adaptation 

and Mitigation (CCAM) 

 

7. NYC conducted risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and mitigation measures 
in compliance with Section 36 of the GP of the GAA of FY 2020, as follows: 

 

a. The NYC participated in an online campaign #MyTopTenClimateActions, 
which encourages young people from ASEAN to adopt to their version of a 

climate smart strategy based on these made-by-youth climate actions, and 

promote awareness on the importance of climate action and resilience 

especially during the pandemic: 

 

 Grow a tree 

 Practice urban gardening 

 Utilize rainwater 

 Contribute and share eco-data 

 Leave no trace while traveling 



 

39 

 

 

 Walk, bike, carpool  

 Consume responsibly 

 Promote renewable energy 

 Promote environmental and energy consciousness 
 Refuse single use plastic 

 

b. To facilitate the commemoration of the 2020 National Day for Youth Climate 
Action (NYDCA) and ASEAN Youth in Climate Action and Disaster 

Resiliency Day (AYCADRD), NYC led the development of NYDCA and 

AYCADRD toolkit to celebrate youth in climate action and disaster resilience 

across the Philippines and Southeast Asia. 

 

c. As of November 30, 2020, a total of 376 #MyClimateAction pledges were 
aggregated by campaign’s social media monitoring system. The aggregated 

hashtags comprise of pledges from Youth Organizations, LGUs including 

Sangguniang Kabataan Councils, Schools, ASEAN and volunteers. 

 

d. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, the Metro-wide earthquake and fire drill 
conducted by local and national government in order to raise awareness and
