EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The National Youth Commission (NYC) was created by virtue of the 

Republic Act (RA) No. 8044 also known as the “Youth in Nation-Building Act” as 

the policy-making coordinating body of all youth-related institutions, programs, 

projects and activities of the government. 

 

Its objectives are to: (a) provide the leadership in the formulation of policies 

and in the setting of priorities and direction of all youth promotion and development 

programs and activities; (b) encourage wide and active participation of the youth in 

all governmental and non-governmental programs, projects and activities affecting 

them; (c) harness and develop the full potential of the youth as partners in nation-

building; and (d) supplement government appropriations for youth promotion and 

development with funds from other sources. 

 

The NYC is headed by Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer Ryan R. 

Enriquez, who is assisted by five Commissioners – three of whom represent Luzon, 

Visayas and Mindanao, and two Commissioners-at-Large. The Agency has area 

offices in seven regional areas, namely: Baguio City, Naga City, Cebu City, 

Cagayan de Oro City, Davao City and Iloilo City. 

 

As at December 31, 2020, NYC is complemented by 128 personnel, 

composed of 6 Presidential appointees, 66 permanent employees, 10 staffs with co-

terminus status and 46 Contracts of Service (COS).

F.  Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations  
 

The following are the significant audit observations and the corresponding 

recommendations: 

 

1. Unreleased and stale checks as of December 31, 2020 totaling ₱291,176.88, 
were not reverted back to the cash account and correspondingly did not 

recognize the appropriate liability account, contrary to Section 56, Chapter 19, 

Volume 1 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 

Government Agencies (NGAs), affecting the fair presentation of the Cash in 

Bank –LCCA and Accounts Payable accounts. (Paragraph No. 1) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant to 

ensure that all unreleased and stale checks at year-end be restored back to the 

Agency’s Cash in Bank – LCCA account, and correspondingly set up the 

Accounts Payable account. 

 

2. Inventories and PPE totaling ₱141,046.00 with capitalization threshold below 
₱15,000 were not recognized as semi-expendable properties; while non-

impairment provision was not recognized for unserviceable properties with an 

aggregate book value of ₱9,352.75, thus, affecting the fair presentation of the 

affected accounts in the financial statements.  (Paragraph No. 2) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the:  

 

a. Chief Accountant to prepare the following adjusting entries for the: 
 

i. reclassification of semi-expendable properties:

3. NYC hired a total of 51 Contract of Service/Job Orders (COS/JOs), with a 
total salary of ₱8,923,561.43 for CY 2020, whose: (a) responsibilities or job 

descriptions are similar to those performed by the regular employees; and (b) 

contracts were renewed during the pandemic when PAPs were 

shelved/deferred, contrary to Section 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 of CSC-COA-DBM JC 

No. 1, series of 2017. Moreover, the Agency may not have been prudent in 

spending government funds. (Paragraph No. 3) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. advise the Human Resource Merit Promotion and Selection Board 
(HRMPSB) to: 

 

i. exert more effort in filling up the vacant plantilla positions; hence, 
the hiring of COS/JOs will ease off; and 

 

ii. ensure that assigned tasks or job descriptions of COS/JOs are not 
similar to those being performed by the regular employees and 

limit only to the works/jobs mentioned under Section 7.1 and 7.2 

of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, series of 2017; and 

 

b. require the COS/JOs’ superiors to ensure that assigned and performed jobs 
are aligned with the contracted activities of the COS/JO personnel. 

 

4. The Due to BIR balance as of December 31, 2020 included the unaccounted 
and unremitted withholding taxes amounting to ₱33,858.42, contrary to 

Section 3.5 of DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 1-2000 and rendered the 

balance unreliable. (Paragraph No. 9) 

 

We recommended that the Chief Accountant facilitate the verification and 

reconciliation of the unaccounted/unremitted balance of Due to BIR account 

and cause its immediate adjustment/remittance to BIR in conformity with 

Section 3.5 of DOF-DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 1-2000.
