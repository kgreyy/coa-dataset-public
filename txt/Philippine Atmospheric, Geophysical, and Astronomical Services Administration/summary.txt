During the year, PAGASA received funds totaling ₱13,713,931.55 from DOST and 

other sources to implement various programs and projects.  

  

Also, the PAGASA’s income totaling ₱8,266,774.02 was received from issuances 

of weather certificates to contractors, sale of journals pertaining to astronomical data to 

students, offices and other interested parties, fees from other sectors for the calibration of 

scientific equipment like barometers and other instruments, admission fee from different 

schools and concession fees.  

  

B. Scope of Audit  
  

 The audit covered the accounts and operations of PAGASA for the year ended 

December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to (a) ascertain the level of assurance that 

may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) recommend 

agency’s improvement opportunities, (c) determine the propriety of transactions as well as 

the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations, and (d) determine the 

extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.  

 

C. Independent Auditor’s Report   
 

A qualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements as at December 31, 

2020, as the Agency’s Cash, Inventories, Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and Other 

Assets accounts have misstatements totaling ₱63.100 million, representing 1.06 percent of 

its total assets; while Financial Liabilities, Inter-Agency Payables, Trust Liabilities and 

Other Payables accounts have misstatements of ₱10.445 million or 2.82 percent of its total 

reported Liabilities; and Net Assets/Equity had misstatements of ₱43.342 million or 0.78 

percent of its total amount. Due to the significant impact of such misstatements on the 

reported balances of the affected accounts, Management’s assertions as to the accuracy, 

existence, completeness, rights and obligations of the said accounts could not be relied 

upon. 

 

D. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations  
  

The following are the other significant audit observations and the corresponding 

recommendations:  



iii  

  

 

1. The Inventory account balance of ₱68,923,554.66 as at December 31, 2020 was 
unreliable due to recognition of items amounting to ₱2,490,817.00 under trust fund as 

outright expense and other lapses in inventory management, resulting in the existence of a 

negative balance for Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory account amounting 

to ₱187,297.90, and unreconciled discrepancies between the Accounting records and the 

Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI).  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

 

a) The Accountant to: 
 

i. immediately submit the lacking supporting documents relating to the 
issuance of Inventories and to implement the Perpetual Inventory 

Method in recording Inventories, for both general and trust funds;  

 

ii. review completeness of supporting documents prior to recording of the 
JEVs in the books of accounts; and 

 

iii. make the necessary adjustments in the books to reflect the correct 
balances and reduce/eliminate the existence of negative account balances. 

 

b) The Property Officer to: 
 

i. demand concerned Deputy Administrator and project proponents to 
forward original documents such as DR, IAR and PO as well as the 

covering RIS, RSMI and ICS for posting of deliveries and issuances of 

items in the SCs for subsequent submission to the Accountant for 

recording deliveries/issuances in the books; and 

 

ii.  notify the Audit Team of all the deliveries within 24 hours after 
acceptance; and 

 

c) Both the Accountant and Property Officer to exercise due diligence in 
analyzing and reconciling the balances per Accounting records and RPCI. 

 

2. The PPE account balances totaling to ₱6,377,042,556.05 as at December 31, 2020 
showed a variance of ₱355,481,326.56 against the amount of ₱6,021,561,229.49 reported 

in the RPCPPE, which could not be validated due to the lack of basic and mandatory 

records to support the nature/details of some PPE; thus, casting doubt on the existence of 

assets owned by the agency as reported in the Financial Statements. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

 

a) The Accountant to effect corrections on all the noted discrepancies above by 
recording in the books all the unrecorded items reported in the RPCPPE, the 



iv  

  

presentation of the items recorded in the books for inclusion in the RPCPPE 

and derecognition in the books of disposed PPE;  

 

b) The Property Officer to exert effort in locating information/details of various 
PPE lumped in the RPCPPE from the original source documents or records 

like the paid disbursement vouchers, Purchase Orders, Inspection and 

Acceptance Reports, etc. under MTS Fund 102, Fund 184, Donation and 

PAGASA Interactive Climate and Weather Information Network (PICWIN) 

funds, prior to the conduct of proper and complete annual physical count of 

all PPE (stating their conditions and whereabouts); and 

 

c) henceforth, the Accountant and the Property Officer to conduct a periodic 
reconciliation of their records to identify the causes of the differences and act 

accordingly. 

 

3. The existence and correctness of the Other Assets account balance of 
₱456,880,388.60 out of the ₱458,349,196.54 reported as at December 31, 2020 could not 

be relied upon due to the unavailability of sufficient supporting schedules, non-periodic 

reconciliation of the property and accounting records, and non-preparation/submission of 

the covering IIRUP for unserviceable properties.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Property Officer to: 

 

a) present and include all the assets reclassified to the Other Assets account that 
were not reported in the RPCPPE totaling to ₱1,289,582.94; 

 

b) exert extra effort in locating records/documents to support the details of PPE 
recorded under the Other Assets account; and  

 

c) conduct an inventory of properties identified in the Other Assets account and 
determine their serviceability; if upon assessment it is found unserviceable, 

IIRUP shall be prepared for submission to the Accounting Unit for 

derecognition in the books after its disposal. 

 

4. The Due to NGAs and Trust Liabilities account balances of ₱81,980,604.69 and 
₱(2,527,566.32), respectively, as at December 31, 2020 were unreliable due to: (a) reported 

variance of ₱30,791,020.34 between the balances per books and the Source Agency (SA)-

confirmed balances; (b) inclusion of ₱37,880,170.83 cost of completed projects that 

remained outstanding for one (1) year to over nine (9) years not refunded to the Bureau of 

the Treasury (BTr)/SA; and (c) other lapses in recordkeeping resulting  in the existence of 

negative account balances amounting to ₱(7,376,177.01) as at year-end.  

 

 

 

 

 



v  

  

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

 

a) Prepare FRs/TRs with complete information such as ORs to acknowledge 
funds received and expenses incurred such as Check no./date based on 

RCI/RD including JEV no. for every adjustment made in the financial project 

records; 

 

b) Review/correct/update the project individual SL and ensure that the balances 
appearing in the SL are properly supported by information traceable to 

original documents to avoid accumulation of negative balances; 

 

c) Henceforth, post all transactions in the individual SL of a project at the time 
of occurrence based on the ORs/RCI/RDs to avoid erroneous 

entries/misstatements, incomplete entries and unsupported documentations;  

 

d) Conduct reconciliation with the SA Accountant to identify the variance 
reported between the balances per books and the SA books of accounts; and 

 

e) Close the account of completed projects through submission of liquidation 
reports and refund the unexpended balances to the SA/BTr.  

 

The above observations and recommendations were discussed with the concerned 

officials of the agency through Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations 

(SAOR) in lieu of exit conference. Management’s views and comments were considered 

in the report, where appropriate.
