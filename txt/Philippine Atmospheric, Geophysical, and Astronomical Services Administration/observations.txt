      PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

Financial Audit 

Accounting Errors/Omissions 

 
1. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services 
Administration’s (PAGASA) Cash, Inventories, Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE), 
and Other Assets accounts have misstatements totaling ₱61.630 million or 1.04 percent 
of its total assets; while Financial Liabilities, Inter-Agency Payables, Trust Liabilities 
and Other Payables accounts have misstatements of ₱10.445 million or 2.82 percent 
of its total reported Liabilities; and Net Assets/Equity have misstatements of ₱43.342 
million or 0.78 percent of its total amount as at December 31, 2020; thus, resulting in 
the over/understatement of the accounts affected. Due to the significant impact of 
such misstatements on the reported balances of the affected accounts, Management’s 
assertions as to the accuracy, existence, classification and completeness as well as 
rights and obligations of the said accounts could not be relied upon. 
 
2. Paragraph 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards 1 (IPSAS 1) 
and Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, 
provide that the financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial 
performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful 
representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance 
with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set 
out in IPSAS. The application of IPSAS, with additional disclosures when necessary, is 
presented to result in financial statements that achieve a fair presentation. 
 
3. Moreover, Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 require 
agencies to keep the accounts in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency 
and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control 
agencies of the government; and that the highest standard of honesty, objectivity and 
consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate 
and misleading information. Each government agency shall record its financial transactions 
and operations conformably with IPSAS and in accordance with pertinent laws and 
regulations. 

 
4. Verification of the journal entry vouchers (JEVs), disbursement vouchers, 
liquidation reports, inventory and property records of the PAGASA disclosed accounting 
errors and omissions affecting Management’s assertions that all transactions and events 
should be recorded and have been recorded (Completeness), were recorded without error 
(Accuracy), and in the proper accounts (Classification) as shown in Table 1.

6. The book reconciling items identified in the latest Bank Reconciliation Statements 
(BRSs) submitted with a net amount of ₱6,245,747.99, remained unrecorded in the books 
as at December 31, 2020, contrary to Section 6, Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I, as

7. Out of the total unrecognized book reconciling items of ₱6,245,747.99, only 
₱1,289,829.63 or 21% pertains to the current year. The remaining ₱4,955,918.36 (see 
Annex B for details) is identified to be carried forward balances from the CY 2019 BRS 
and remained unadjusted in the books of accounts for a considerable length of time, 
entailing lack of action by the Accountant, thus, contributed significantly to the 
understatement of Cash in Bank-LCCA at year-end amounting to ₱6,245,747.99. 
 
8. The unrecorded reconciling items of ₱6,245,747.99 resulted in the misstatements 
of the following accounts:

9. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to effect 
the necessary adjustments pertaining to the book reconciling items of ₱6,245,747.99. 
 
10. The Accountant prepared the adjusting entries for the book reconciling items of 
₱6,245,747.99 through the following JEV Nos. 2021-01-000041 to 000054 dated January 
4, 2021; 2021-02-000088, 2021-02-000090, 2021-02-000092 all dated February 28, 2021; 
2021-03-000086 dated March 12, 2021; and 2021-04-000147; 2021-04-000158 dated April 
30, 2021. 

 
11. The recorded JEVs have been validated and found in order. 
 
b. Stale checks amounting to ₱6,282.59 reported as outstanding commercial checks 
 
12. Section 44, Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume I states that checks may be cancelled 
when they become stale, voided or spoiled. The depository bank considers a check stale, if 
it has been outstanding for over six (6) months from date of issue or as prescribed.  

 
13. A stale, voided or spoiled check shall be marked cancelled on its face and reported 
as follows: 
 

a. Voided, spoiled or unclaimed stale checks with the Cashier shall be reported 
as cancelled in the List of Unreleased Checks that will be attached to the Report 
of Checks Issued (RCI). 
 

b. New checks may be issued for the replacement of stale/spoiled checks in the 
hands of the payees or holders in due course, upon submission of the 
stale/spoiled checks to the Accounting Division/Unit. A certified copy of the 
previously paid DVs shall be attached to the request for replacement. A JEV 
shall be prepared to take up the cancellation. The replacement check shall be 
reported in the RCI. 

 
14. As at December 31, 2020, reconciling items for outstanding checks included checks 
that became stale, as shown below:

TOTAL      6,282.59  

 
15. The checks with the total amount of ₱6,282.59 remained outstanding for over six 
(6) months due to non-periodic coordination between the Accounting Unit and the Cashier 
Unit with regard to the existence of stale checks. The failure by the Accountant to 
revert/adjust in the books of accounts the said stale checks resulted in the understatement 
of the Cash in Bank – LCCA, Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable, Due to Officers and 
Employees, and Other Payables accounts by ₱6,282.59, ₱1,191.21, ₱869.96 and 
₱4,221.42, respectively. 

 
16. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
periodically coordinate with the Cashier regarding the existence of stale checks and 
to take up the necessary adjusting entries in the books of accounts for the stale checks 
of ₱6,282.59. 
 
17. Management commented that stale checks amounting to ₱6,282.59 were adjusted 
through JEV No. 2021-02-000095 to 2021-02-000098 dated February 28, 2021. 
 
18. The recorded JEVs have been validated and found in order. 
 
c. Five (5) out of eight (8) dormant bank accounts amounting to ₱377,248.80 not 

included in the Statement of Financial Position. 
 
19. Five (5) bank accounts totaling ₱377,248.80 (i.e., items 4-8 as presented in Table 
24 and included in the findings on unnecessary funds not remitted to the National Treasury 
under paragraphs 126-136 of this report) remained unrecorded in the books of accounts 
due to the failure of the Accountant to conduct thorough analysis/monitoring of the cash 
accounts maintained with the Authorized Government Depository Bank (AGDB). Hence, 
this is in violation of COA Circular No. 94-013 and Section 111 of PD 1445, which provide 
that “the cash/money transferred shall be taken up as a trust liability by the implementing 
agency (IA)” and that “the accounts of the agency shall be kept in such detail as is 
necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to finish the 
information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.” 
 
20. The unrecorded bank accounts resulted in the understatement of the Cash in Bank-
LCCA and Trust Liabilities accounts by ₱377,248.80. 
 
21. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
record in the books the five (5) dormant bank account balances totaling ₱377,248.80.  



42 
 

 
22. Management commented that the five (5) dormant bank accounts with a total 
balance of ₱377,248.80 were recorded in the books under JEV No. 2021-04-000108 to 
2021-04-000112 dated April 1, 2021. 

 
23. The recorded JEVs have been validated and found in order. 
 
d. Accounting errors and unrecorded receipt/issuances of inventories understated the 

Inventory account by ₱5,518,444.96. 
 
24. The Inventory account balance of ₱68,923,554.66 as at December 31, 2020 was 
understated by ₱5,518,444.96 due to accounting errors and unrecorded 
receipt/issuances of inventories, in violation of Section 15, Chapter 2 of the GAM for 
National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I and Section 111 (2) of PD 1445. 
  
25. Section 15, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I states that “the FSs shall 
present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity 
(xxx).” 
 
26. Moreover, Section 111 (2) of PD 1445 provides “The highest standards of honesty, 
objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard 
against inaccurate or misleading information.” 

 

27. Our audit of the Inventory account disclosed an overstatement of ₱81,460.47 
resulting from the following errors in recording: (See Annex C for details)

28. We noted that the erroneous recording of ₱137.37 for Other Supplies and Materials 
for Distribution account was already reported in the prior year’s audit report but remained 
unadjusted by the Accountant. 
 
29. Moreover, the inventory account balance of ₱39,500.00 with PO No. 19-04-0194 
was erroneously recorded under Other Supplies and Materials for Distribution account 



43 
 

with JEV No. 2019-05-001884 dated May 31, 2019 instead of Printing and Publication 
Expenses account, thereby, overstating the Inventory account by ₱39,500.00. 
 
30. We also noted that the acquisition of 700 pieces Radiosonde Transmitter under PO 
No. 2019-003 PB dated March 5, 2019, in the amount of ₱ 11,888,468.59, was recorded 
under Other Supplies and Materials Inventory account (in the amount of ₱2,972,117.15) 
and Other Supplies and Materials Inventory for Distribution (in the amount of 
₱8,916,351.45), instead of Other Supplies and Materials Inventory account; thus, casting 
doubt on the reliability of the Inventory account balances prior to recognizing the said 
amounts to Other Supplies and Materials Expenses account for the issuance/consumption.  
 
31. Moreover, unrecorded issuances of inventories added up to the overstatement of 
the Inventory accounts by ₱350,094.57, as shown in Table 6.

32. The above Table disclosed recurring observation for items amounting to 
₱342,557.35 under Other Supplies and Materials for Distribution account that likewise 
remained unadjusted in the books of accounts.  

 
33. On the other hand, issuances of inventory items had no corresponding accounting 
entry for their receipt amounting to ₱5,950,000.00 under JEV No. 2019-09-016676 dated 
September 30, 2019, with Purchase Order (PO) No. 2019-001 PB dated January 21, 2019, 
and Inspection and Acceptance Report No. 19-279 that was accepted by the Property 
Officer on July 7, 2019; thereby, understating the Other Supplies and Materials for 
Distribution account by the same amount. 
 
34. It therefore leaves room for doubt why the preceding errors and omission in 
recording inventory transactions were not detected/corrected, and recurring 
observations/recommendations were not complied with as at year-end by Management; 
thus, resulting in the understatement of Inventory account by a net amount of 
₱5,518,444.96 as tabulated in Table 7.

Overstatement on Net Assets/Equity Account               (393,555.04) 

 
36. We recommended that Management require the Accountant to prepare 
adjusting entries to correct the errors and unrecorded receipt/issuances of inventories 
with the net amount of ₱5,518,444.96, and henceforth, facilitate early detection and 
correction of errors to ensure accuracy of the Inventory account balances. Moreover, 
appropriately use Other Supplies and Materials Inventory account in the SL instead of 
Other Supplies and Materials for Distribution account. 
 

37. No Management comments on the foregoing audit observation and 
recommendations were received by the Audit Team as of this report. 
 

e. Office Equipment recognized as outright expense understated the Office Equipment 
account by ₱150,000.00. 
 

38. Acquisition of equipment on October 9, 2020, under PO No. 20-09-0273 amounting 
to ₱168,300.00, has the following details.

39. The total amount of ₱168,300.00 was directly charged to Other Supplies and 
Materials Expenses instead of Office Equipment and Semi-expendable Office Equipment 
account amounting to ₱150,000.00 and ₱18,300.00, respectively. As a result, it overstated 
the Other Supplies and Materials Expenses account and understated the Office Equipment 
account by ₱150,000.00. The Accumulated Depreciation account was also understated by 
₱7,125.00. Consequently, the issuance of the semi-expendable property shall be covered 
by the Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) to serve as basis in recognizing to applicable 
Expense account by the Accountant. 

 
40. We recommended that Management require the Accountant to prepare the 
necessary adjusting entries for the Office Equipment recognized as outright expense 
amounting to ₱150,000.00 and the Accumulated Depreciation of ₱7,125.00. 
 
41. No Management comment on the foregoing audit observation and recommendation 
was received by the Audit Team as of this report. 
 
f. Unrecorded Donations of Technical and Scientific Equipment from JICA -

₱43,259,421.64. 
 
42. Paragraph 95 of IPSAS 23 states that gifts and donations (other than services-in-
kind) are recognized as assets and revenue when it is probable that the future economic 
benefits of service potential will flow to the entity and the fair value of the assets can be 
measured reliably. With gifts and donations, the making of the gift or donation and the 
transfer of legal title are often simultaneous, in such circumstances, there is no doubt as to 
the future economic benefits flowing to the entity. 

 
43. As mentioned in the prior years’ observation, the donation of Rain and Water Level 
Gauges was unrecorded due to incomplete documents and/or non-submission of the Deed 
of Donation from the JICA, among others, to the Accounting Unit. The details are shown 
below:

44. Consequently, the balance of Technical and Scientific Equipment account as at 
December 31, 2020, was not accurately stated, thus, affecting the fairness of the 
presentation of the financial position of the agency. 
 
45. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Property Officer to 
coordinate and/or follow-up with JICA the Deed of Donation and other supporting 
documents of the Technical and Scientific Equipment, and submit to the Accounting 
Unit for recording in the books of accounts. 
 

46. Management commented that they are still waiting for the deed of donation from 
the JICA to be able to record the equipment in the books of accounts. 
 
g.    Erroneous recording of CA transactions overstated the Advances to Special Disbursing 

Officers account and understated the Advances to Officers and Employees account by 
₱624,522.00 and ₱209,485.46, respectively. 

 
47. Deficiencies were noted in the recorded grant and liquidation of CAs, contrary to 
Section 111 (2) of PD 1445, as shown in Table 11. (Refer to Annex D for details)

48. The adjusting entry to reclassify Petty Cash account of ₱235,697.00 under JEV No. 
2020-02-007346 dated February 29, 2020, was made to comply with reported observations 
on petty cash funds erroneously recorded as Advances to SDOs in CY 2019 AAR. 
However, reclassification was found inappropriate since liquidation had already been 
recorded in Advances to SDOs account, prior to reclassification to Petty Cash account, 
thereby, understating the Advances to SDOs account and overstating the Petty Cash 
account by ₱235,697.00.

49. In summary, the following accounts were misstated due to erroneous recording of 
CA transactions:

50. We recommended that Management require the Accountant to effect the 
necessary adjusting entries in the books of accounts for Advances to Special 
Disbursing Officers, and Advances to Officers and Employees amounting to 
(₱624,522.00) and ₱209,485.46, respectively. 
 
51. No Management comment on the foregoing audit observation and recommendation 
was received by the Audit Team as of this report. 
 
h. Fully depreciated assets reclassified to the Other Assets account - ₱1,468,807.94. 
 
52. Fully depreciated assets amounting to ₱1,468,807.94 reclassified to the Other 
Assets account is contrary to Sections 39 (d) and 40 of Chapter 10 of the GAM for 
NGAs, Volume I, thereby, understating the corresponding PPE account by the same 
amount.  
 
53. Chapter 3, Volume III of the GAM defines Other Assets account as assets not 
falling under any of the specific asset accounts and credited for disposal or reclassification 
to specific asset accounts. 

 
54. Section 39.d, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I also mentions that “A JEV shall 
be prepared by the Accounting Division/Unit to derecognize the asset from the books of 
accounts only after its disposal.”  

 
55. Section 40 of the same Manual also provides the following policies on idle, 
unserviceable and fully depreciated PPE:  

 
a. Temporary idle activity or abandonment of PPE does not preclude depreciating 

the asset, as future benefits are consumed not only through usage but also 
through obsolescence, and wear and tear. 
 



48 
 

b. A PPE is said to be fully depreciated when the carrying amount is equal to zero 
or residual value. The cost of fully depreciated assets remaining in service and 
the related accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses shall 
not be removed from the accounts. 

 
c. A PPE is said to be unserviceable if it is no longer capable of providing the 

entity with future economic benefits or service potential.  
 
d. All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection 

Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74). PPE reported in the 
IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-PPE (cost 
of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation).  

 
56. Accounting records, however, showed that the following fully depreciated PPE 
accounts were reclassified to the Other Assets account under JEV No. 18-04-127 dated 
April 30, 2018, contrary to the above provisions that the costs of fully depreciated assets 
remaining in service shall not be removed from the accounts, that all unserviceable assets 
be reported in the IIRUP and shall be dropped from the books at its disposal.

TOTAL 14,688,079.37 13,219,271.43 1,468,807.94 

 
57. The previous OIC-Accountant reclassified the above PPEs to the Other Assets 
account based merely on the letter from the Property Officer dated January 24, 2017 
together with an IIRUP without the covering approval or signatures of authorized officials 
and lists of assets with undetermined location, thereby, overstating the Other Assets 
account and understating the corresponding PPE account by ₱1,468,807.94.  

 
58. We made a reconciliation of the reclassified assets with the Report on the Physical 
Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) for CY 2019 based on property 
numbers provided and noted that only two (2) items were reported thereat, as follows:

TOTAL   179,225.00 161,302.50 17,922.50

59. The erroneous reclassification of fully depreciated assets to the Other Assets 
account and the statement of the Property Officer that they are still locating the said assets 
to inspect if these are still being used or for disposal also raised doubt in the existence of 
the recorded assets of ₱1,468,807.94.  
 
60. We recommended that Management require the Accountant to: 

 
a. discontinue the reclassification of unserviceable PPEs to Other Assets 

account; and 
 

b. revert to the corresponding PPE account the fully depreciated PPEs 
previously reclassified to Other Assets account amounting to 
₱1,468,807.94. 

 

61. No Management comment on the foregoing audit observation and recommendation 
was received by the Audit Team as of this report. 
 
i. Erroneous recording of receipt of funds for project implementation - ₱506,000.00 

 
62. Chapter 3, Volume III of the GAM states that Due to NGAs account is credited to 
recognize the receipt of funds for delivery of goods/services as authorized by law, fund 
transfers from NGAs, other than the BIR, for implementation of specific programs or 
projects subject to liquidation and other inter-agency transactions.  
 
63. Funds for the project Bridging the Gap between Seasonal Climate Forecasts and 
Decision Makers in Agriculture transferred by the DOST with account balance of 
₱506,000.00 was recorded under the Trust Liabilities account instead of the Due to NGAs 
account. Thereby, overstating the Trust Liabilities account and understating the Due to 
NGAs account by the same amount of ₱506,000.00. 
 
64. We recommended that Management require the Accountant to reclassify the 
account balance of ₱506,000.00 recorded under the Trust Liabilities account to the 
Due to NGAs account. 
 
65. No Management comment on the foregoing audit observation and recommendation 
was received by the Audit Team as of this report. 
 
66. In summary, the total misstatements in the Cash, Inventories, PPE and Other Asset 
accounts amounting to ₱61.630 million represent 1.04 percent of the total assets; while 
Financial Liabilities, Inter-Agency Payables, Trust Liabilities and Other Payables 
accounts had misstatements of ₱10.445 million or 2.82 percent of the total reported 
Liabilities; and Net Assets/Equity had misstatements of ₱43.342 million or 0.78 percent of 
its total amount as at December 31, 2020. Due to the significant impact of these 
misstatements on the financial statements of the PAGASA, we rendered a Qualified 
Opinion on the financial statements of the agency as at year-end.

Accounting/Reporting Deficiencies 

 
67. We have also noted some accounting deficiencies which affected the reported 
balances of the accounts in the financial statements, as follows: 
 

a. Posting Errors in Cash in Bank- Local Currency, Current Account 
 
68. The following posting errors were also presented in the BRSs as book reconciling 
items:

69. It must be noted that Check No. 1630217 in the posting error above was already 
cancelled, thus, it should not be included as part of the outstanding checks. 
 
70. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to effect 
the necessary adjustments for posting errors in the books of accounts. 
 
71. Management commented that posting errors were adjusted through JEV Nos. 2021-
01-000043, 2021-01-000045, and 2021-01-000054 all dated January 4, 2021; 2021-02-
000092 dated February 28, 2021; and 2021-03-000086 dated March 12, 2021. 

 
72. The recorded JEVs have been validated and found in order. 
 

b. Management acts as the collecting agent of private institutions of personal 
obligations of employees and Cost of Service/Job Order personnel  



51 
 

 
73. Section 47 of Republic Act (RA) No. 11465 or the General Appropriations Act of 
CY 2020 provides the authorized deductions from the salaries and other benefits accruing 
to any government employee, such as the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), Government 
Service Insurance System (GSIS), PhilHealth, and Associations or provident funds 
organized and managed by government employees for their benefit and welfare, among 
others.  

  
74. Audit of salaries and allowances of PAGASA employees covering the payroll from 
January to December 2020 totaling ₱244,026,335.82 revealed that deductions in the 
amount of ₱38,782,905.23 were made from the salaries and allowances of PAGASA 
employees recorded under Payable accounts for subsequent remittance to concerned 
private institutions such as Weather Bureau Multipurpose Cooperative (WBMPC), Health 
Maintenance Organization (HMO), Land Bank of the Philippines, Cocolife, Credit Union, 
PAGASA Employee’s Consumers Coop. Inc. (PECCI), Philam Life, Insular Life and 
Manila Bank. Deduction from payrolls was due to the practice of Management of 
automatically assigning the Payroll and Accounting Units to consider helping personnel in 
settling their obligations from these private institutions through the representation of their 
association to Management.  

 
75. In addition, Social Security System (SSS) premium contributions in the amount of 
₱200,400.00, as shown in Table 16, were also withheld from the salaries of 42 Job Order 
(JO)/Contract of Service (COS) personnel, a clear violation of Social Security Act of 1997 
(Republic Act 8282) further amended by Republic Act No. 11199 or the Social Security 
Act of 2018 since it applies only to those working in the private sector.    

 
Table 16. Monthly deductions of SSS Contribution.

July  15,000.00  

August  15,000.00  

September  15,600.00  

October  17,400.00  

November  16,800.00  

December 15,600.00 

TOTAL  200,400.00  

  
76. Withholding of loan/personal obligations and SSS premium contributions from the 
monthly salaries of employees and Job Order/Cost of Service personnel for subsequent 
remittance to private institutions are mere accommodations by the agency as these are 
personal transactions that should be settled personally by the employees.   

  



52 
 

77. The practice to act as collecting agent of the private institutions to more than 800 
employees of the agency is not only contrary to the provisions of the GAA and RA 11199 
but has also added to the voluminous monthly transactions/workload handled by the 
Personnel, Budget and Accounting Units. The documentation of the unnecessary 
transactions from the computation of the amount to be deducted from the payrolls, 
preparation of Disbursement Vouchers and Checks for remittances may yield negative 
results in the submission of legitimate reports and performance of said offices.   

 
78. Any activity that could hamper the delivery of proper services of the agency should 
be stopped.  
  
79. We recommended and Management agreed to stop the practice of acting as 
collecting agent of private companies/institutions by withholding the obligations of 
employees/COS or JO personnel from their monthly salaries since this is not allowed 
under the provisions of Section 47 of the GAA and RA 11199.   
 
80. No Management comment on the foregoing audit observation and recommendation 
was received by the Audit Team as of this report. 
 

c. Lapses in Inventory Management 
 
81. The Inventory account balance of ₱68,923,554.66 as at December 31, 2020 was 
unreliable due to recognition of items amounting to ₱2,490,817.00 under trust fund 
as outright expense and other lapses in inventory management, resulting in the 
existence of a negative balance for Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory 
account amounting to ₱187,297.90, and unreconciled discrepancies between the 
Accounting records and the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI).  
 
82. Section 7, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that “When 
inventories are sold, exchanged, or distributed, their carrying amount shall be recognized 
as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. If there is no related 
revenue, the expense is recognized when the goods are distributed or the related service is 
rendered.” 
 
83. Section 9 - Perpetual Inventory Method, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I states 
that “Supplies and materials purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the 
perpetual inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running 
total for the cost of goods sold in each period. The system requires accounting records to 
show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through the maintenance of the SLC by 
the Accounting Division/Unit and Stock Card (SC) by the Supply and/or Property 
Division/Unit for each item in stock. Regular purchases shall be coursed through the 
inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for 

supplies and materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on emergency cases 

which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense accounts.” 
 



53 
 

84. Appendix 57 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II states that the Supplies Ledger 
Card (SLC) is a form used in the Accounting Division/Unit for each type of supplies to 
record all receipts and issues made. It shall be maintained by fund cluster. The agency 
shall conduct physical count of inventories every semester. The semestral physical 
inventory of supplies shall be reconciled with the SLCs and controlling accounts and 
Supply and/or Property records. Any discrepancies shall be immediately verified and 
adjusted. 
 
85. Review and validation of Office Supplies Expenses and Other Supplies and 
Materials Expenses accounts under the trust fund revealed that inventory items amounting 
to ₱1,592,886.00 and ₱897,931.00, respectively, were recognized as outright expense. 
 
86. The Property Officer acknowledged that deliveries made to field offices as well as 
procurement charged to various projects under trust fund were not included in the SCs they 
maintained.  
 
87. As previously observed, delivery receipts (DRs) from field offices were sent 
directly to the concerned Office of the Deputy Administrator instead of both the concerned 
Office of the Deputy Administrator and the Property Unit before forwarding to the Cashier 
and Accounting Unit, thus, not in conformity with the procedures set forth in Sequence (5), 
Section 15, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I, requiring to: “Forward Copy 3 of Inspection 
and Acceptance Report (IAR) and photocopy of PO and DR to the Accounting 
Division/Unit for recording the received/accepted goods and posting to the SLC, and Copy 
4 of IAR and copy 2 of PO to the Stock Card Keeper for recording in the SCs.” Henceforth, 
the DRs, together with the IAR, should be forwarded to the Procurement Unit for recording 
to the SC before forwarding the same to the Office of the Cashier for the preparation of 
DVs and submitted to the Accounting Office for processing of payments. 

 
88. The same practice was noted with regard to procurement under trust fund. We also 
noted the outright recognition of Inventory Items to the expense account due to the 
aforementioned failure to comply with the procedure in the receipt, inspection, acceptance 
and recording of deliveries as stated in the GAM. Furthermore, the concerned project 
proponents’ non-adherence to COA Circular No. 95-006 dated May 18, 1995, which states 
that “The official responsible for or in charge of accepting deliveries of procured items 
shall, within twenty-four (24) hours from such acceptance, shall notify the auditor of the 
time and date of the scheduled deliveries,” is evident in the notice of delivery attached to 
the paid vouchers that was not transmitted to the Audit Team. 
 
89. As stated in Sequence (18), Section 16, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I, “Chief 
Accountant/Head of Accounting Division/Unit reviews correctness of the accounting entry 
and completeness of supporting documents. If in order, signs the “Certified Correct by” 
portion of the JEV and forwards Copies 1 and 2 of JEV to the Bookkeeper. If not in order, 
returns the JEV and supporting documents to the Accounting Staff concerned for 
correction.” However, verification of DVs for trust fund transactions revealed that some 
supporting documents were incomplete and not in order such as inappropriate use of 
Property Acknowledgment Receipt (PAR) for semi-expendable property, failure to notify 



54 
 

the Auditor within 24-hours from acceptance of the deliveries, non-preparation of Report 
of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) and not properly filled-out PAR and ICS (lacking 
property/inventory item number). It is noteworthy to mention that RSMI shall be prepared 
by the Property and/or Supply Custodian based on the Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) and 
shall be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the JEV to record the 
supplies and materials issued as provided in the GAM. Hence, the reported Inventory 
account balance is unreliable due to the recognition of the supplies and materials as outright 
expense despite the lack of supporting documents for its issuances. 
 
90. This resulted in the Inventory account balances as generated from the General 
Ledgers vis-à-vis having no balances reported in the Report on the Physical Count of 
Inventories (RPCI) by the Property Unit at year-end yielded a variance of ₱68,923,554.66, 
details shown in Table 17.

91. The RPCI for CY 2020 has zero balance since there were no available items per 
card/on hand as at year-end and deliveries were directly received by the end-users. 
 
92. While we appreciate Management’s efforts in ensuring that all receipts and issuance 
of supplies are accounted for/recorded and that RPCI is timely submitted in CY 2020, the 
problem lies on the reconciliation of outstanding balances that were carried over in the 
books.  
 
93. In reiteration of our prior year’s observation, the balances in CY 2018 of Office 
Supplies Inventory and Other Supplies and Materials for Distribution accounts amounting 
to ₱58,916,534.50 and ₱15,393,275.05, respectively, were carried forward and remained 
outstanding until year-end of CY 2020 due to the absence of adequate documents to support 
the recorded transactions. Thus, the accuracy and reliability of the account balances could 
not be established. Noteworthy, the difference of ₱5,520,758.78 between the year-end 
balances in 2018 and 2020 of Other Supplies and Materials for Distribution account was 
an understatement resulting from errors in recording, and unrecorded issuances and receipt 
of inventories as shown in Table 8.   

 
94. The lapses in inventory management also resulted in the presence of a negative 
balance for Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory account amounting to 
₱187,297.97 that added doubt on the reliability of the inventory balance reflected in the 
Financial Statements and, thus, inconsistent with Section 111 (2) of PD 1445.  
 



55 
 

95. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Accountant to: 
 
i. immediately submit the lacking supporting documents relating to the 

issuance of Inventories and to implement the Perpetual Inventory 
Method in recording Inventories, for both general and trust funds;  
 

ii. review completeness of supporting documents prior to recording of 
the JEVs in the books of accounts; and 

 
iii. make the necessary adjustments in the books to reflect the correct 

balances and reduce/eliminate the existence of negative account 
balances. 
 

b. The Property Officer to: 
 
i. demand concerned Deputy Administrator and project proponents to 

forward original documents such as DR, IAR and PO as well as the 
covering RIS, RSMI and ICS for posting of deliveries and issuances 
of items in the SCs for subsequent submission to the Accountant for 
recording deliveries/issuances in the books; and 
 

ii.  notify the Audit Team of all the deliveries within 24 hours after 
acceptance; and 
 

c. Both the Accountant and Property Officer to exercise due diligence in 
analyzing and reconciling the balances per Accounting records and RPCI. 

 
96. No Management comments on the foregoing audit observations and 
recommendations were received by the Audit Team as of this report. 
 

d. Unreconciled net difference of various PPE accounts by ₱355,481,326.56. 
 
97. The PPE account balances totaling to ₱6,377,042,556.05 as at December 31, 
2020 showed a variance of ₱355,481,326.56 against the amount of ₱6,021,561,229.49 
reported in the RPCPPE, which could not be validated due to the lack of basic and 
mandatory records to support the nature/details of some PPE; thus, casting doubt on 
the existence of assets owned by the agency as reported in the Financial Statements. 
  
98. Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I, provides the accounting policies for PPE 
including the accounting treatment, recognition, measurement, derecognition to ensure that 
all PPEs are properly valued and recorded, and the disclosure requirement in reporting 
PPE. 
 



56 
 

99. In particular, Section 42 thereof provides that, “The Chief Accountant shall 
maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE including work and other animals, livestock 
etc. The PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, 
estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about 
the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise 
maintain PC for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. 
The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting 
Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records like PAR.” 
 
100. Comparison of year-end balances between the accounting and property records 
showing a variance of ₱355,481,326.56 are presented below:

101. The recurring variances were already reported in the CY 2019 audit but were not 
fully addressed by Management. 
 
102. Management  informed us that the net variance between the books and the RPCPPE 
balances could not be reconciled due to: (a) lack of basic and mandatory records to support 
the nature/details of some amounts reported in the RPCPPE, specifically under Buildings, 
Office Equipment, ICT Equipment, Communications Equipment, and Technical and 
Scientific Equipment that were carried over from previous years; and (b) lack of manpower 
to perform the reconciliation of voluminous PPE. This condition runs counter to the 
provision of Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I, requiring reconciliation of 
balance per PC and PPELC maintained by the Property Unit and Accounting Unit, 



57 
 

respectively. As a result, the accuracy of the year-end balances of the sub-accounts 
classified under PPE could not be relied upon. 
 
103. Nevertheless, the noted disparities between the books and the RPCPPE that we 
identified could be attributed, but not limited, to variances in the individual 
recorded/reported amounts in the books/RPCPPE amounting to ₱5,702,898.75; and lump 
sum amounts with no detailed lists of individual items reflected in the books and RPCPPE 
amounting to ₱2,498,142,054.07 and ₱444,578,305.21, respectively. We also noted that 
various PPE accounts under MTS Fund 102, Fund 184, Donation and PAGASA Interactive 
Climate and Weather Information Network (PICWIN) funds were reported with lump sum 
amounts in the RPCPPE. Thus, these should be effected as a take-off point of Management 
in the conduct of reconciliation of PPEs recorded in the books and the lists of properties 
owned by PAGASA as reported in the RPCPPE. 
 
104. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Accountant to effect corrections on all the noted discrepancies above 
by recording in the books all the unrecorded items reported in the 
RPCPPE, the presentation of the items recorded in the books for inclusion 
in the RPCPPE and derecognition in the books of disposed PPE;  

 
b. The Property Officer to exert effort in locating information/details of 

various PPE lumped in the RPCPPE from the original source documents 
or records like the paid disbursement vouchers, Purchase Orders, 
Inspection and Acceptance Reports, etc. under MTS Fund 102, Fund 184, 
Donation and PAGASA Interactive Climate and Weather Information 
Network (PICWIN) funds, prior to the conduct of proper and complete 
annual physical count of all PPE (stating their conditions and 
whereabouts); and 

 
c. Henceforth, the Accountant and the Property Officer to conduct a 

periodic reconciliation of their records to identify the causes of the 
differences and act accordingly. 

 
105. No Management comments on the foregoing audit observations and 
recommendations were received by the Audit Team as of this report. 
 

e. Unreliable year-end balance of Other Assets account 
 

106. The existence and correctness of the Other Assets account balance of 
₱456,880,388.60 out of the ₱458,349,196.54 reported as at December 31, 2020 could 
not be relied upon due to the unavailability of sufficient supporting schedules, non-
periodic reconciliation of the property and accounting records, and non-
preparation/submission of the covering IIRUP for unserviceable properties.  

 



58 
 

107. The non-reconciliation of the Other Assets account between the Accounting and 
Property records has been a long-time issue in PAGASA, with Management’s attention 
being repeatedly called on various audit observations reported annually by the Auditors. 
(See details below.)

The balance of this account has been dormant and has been recorded in the 
books for more than two (2) decades. No documents are available to support their 
existence. 

2011-2012 
The balance of these accounts has been dormant for more than 20 years. No 
documents are available to support their existence. 

2010 
This account includes unserviceable and obsolete PPE found in the Central 
Office Warehouse and different regional PAGASA Offices/Field stations awaiting 
disposal. 

 

108. Due to the unavailability of documents/inventory lists, non-periodic reconciliation 
of the property and accounting records, and the non-preparation/submission of the covering 
IIRUP; the existence, validity and correctness of the Other Assets account balance of 
₱456,880,388.60 could not be ascertained.  

 
109. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Property Officer to: 

 
a. present and include all the assets reclassified to the Other Assets account 

that were not reported in the RPCPPE totaling to ₱1,289,582.94; 
 
b. exert extra effort in locating records/documents to support the details of 

PPE recorded under the Other Assets account; and  
 
c. conduct an inventory of properties identified in the Other Assets account 

and determine their serviceability; if upon assessment it is found 
unserviceable, IIRUP shall be prepared for submission to the Accounting 
Unit for derecognition in the books after its disposal. 

 

110. No Management comment on the foregoing audit observation and recommendation 
was received by the Audit Team as of this report. 
 

f. Unreliable year-end balances of Due to NGAs and Trust Liabilities account 
 
111. The Due to NGAs and Trust Liabilities account balances of ₱81,980,604.69 and 
₱(2,527,566.32), respectively, as at December 31, 2020 were unreliable due to: (a) 
reported variance of ₱30,791,020.34 between the balances per books and the Source 
Agency (SA)-confirmed balances; (b) inclusion of ₱37,880,170.83 cost of completed 
projects that remained outstanding for one (1) year to over nine (9) years not 
refunded to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr)/SA; and (c) other lapses in 



59 
 

recordkeeping resulting  in the existence of negative account balances amounting to 
₱(7,376,177.01) as at year-end.  
 
112. Section 63(f), Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume I provides that within ten (10) days 
after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA shall submit 
the RCI and the Report of Disbursements (RCI/RDs) to report the utilization of the funds.  
Only actual project expenses shall be reported. The reports shall be approved by the Head 
of the IA. 
 

a) Unreconciled balances per books and the SA book 
 

113. The receipt of funds from government offices and various SAs for the 
implementation of the projects were recorded under Due to NGAs and Trust Liabilities 
accounts with year-end balances of ₱81,980,604.69 and ₱ (2,527,566.32), respectively, as 
shown in Tables 20 and 21.

114.  As can be gleaned from Table 20 above, the recorded book balances of 
₱81,980,604.69 had discrepancies reported at ₱30,791,020.34 between the Department of 
Science and Technology-confirmed balances of ₱112,771,625.03, and could be attributed 
to the non-reconciliation/monitoring of the funds received, reported liquidations and the 
outstanding balances reported in the financial/terminal reports (FRs/TRs) submitted to the 
SA.  
 

b) Costs of completed projects not refunded to the SA/BTr 
 

115. Furthermore, the costs of completed project amounting to ₱37,880,170.83 
remained outstanding for one (1) year to over nine (9) years in the account balances and 
the covering cash were not refunded to the SAs or returned to the BTr due to non-
monitoring of project implementation/status and fund utilization by Management in 
accordance with the provisions of the MOA. Thus, contrary to Section 63 (f), Chapter 6 of 
the GAM, Volume I, that the IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion 
of the project, if stipulated in the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA).  
 
116. The following projects were reported completed by the Planning Unit and on the 
basis of the project duration stated in the MOA.

117. The amounts received from the SA had already served its purpose with the reported 
completion of the projects, thus, should have been fully liquidated and the covering 
unexpended balance, if any, should have been returned to the SA, following the afore-
mentioned provisions of Section 63, Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume I.  
 
118. The failure of Management to immediately liquidate and promptly remit any 
remaining fund upon completion of the project will further accumulate long outstanding 
balances and deprive the government of funds that could have been used for other 
beneficial projects. 
 

c) Other lapses in recordkeeping 
 
119. The Accountant started the preparation of eNGAS SLs based on CY 2018 year-end 
balances without the schedules to support the forwarded balances in CY 2019. We also 
noted that the agency maintained two (2) additional SLs to record project expenses and 
depreciation of equipment for later adjustment or posting to the individual SL of a project, 
which is not in accord with proper recordkeeping resulting in unreliable project fund 
balances. 

 
120. Moreover, the submitted FRs/TRs have no reference Official Receipt (OR) to 
acknowledge the receipt of funds and the covering details of disbursements such as Check 
Number, Date and Amount, but merely attached to the covering paid disbursement 
vouchers and RCI. With the absence of the reference details of the original source 
documents in the FRs/TRs, the validity of the funds received, utilized and balances reported 
thereat could not be validated, ascertained and reconciled with the individual SLs of the 
projects.   

 
121. It is worth mentioning that the submission of RCI is a requirement to support the 
reported disbursements and the ending balances of the project funds per Section 63, 
Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume 1. 
 
122. The use of additional SLs for later adjustment to the individual SL of a project, 
instead of posting the transactions directly to the individual project SL based on the 
RCI/RDs, resulted in the existence of negative account balances of projects in the amount 
of ₱(7,376,177.01), as presented in Table 23.

123. The Accountant committed to analyze the accounts thoroughly as stated in the 
Notes to FS, since it appeared that the above projects incurred expenditures more than the 
funds received from the SAs. The existence of negative balances is also a red flag that 
errors were made in the recording of transactions. Hence, the Accountant should 
immediately verify the root cause/s and effect the necessary adjustments in the books to 
prevent accumulation of accounting errors. 
 
124. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

 
a. Prepare FRs/TRs with complete information such as ORs to acknowledge 

funds received and expenses incurred such as Check no./date based on 
RCI/RD including JEV no. for every adjustment made in the financial 
project records; 

 
b. Review/correct/update the project individual SL and ensure that the 

balances appearing in the SL are properly supported by information 
traceable to original documents to avoid accumulation of negative 
balances; 

 
c. Henceforth, post all transactions in the individual SL of a project at the 

time of occurrence based on the ORs/RCI/RDs to avoid erroneous 
entries/misstatements, incomplete entries and unsupported 
documentations;  

 
d. Conduct reconciliation with the SA Accountant to identify the variance 

reported between the balances per books and the SA books of accounts; 
and 

 
e. Close the account of completed projects through submission of liquidation 

reports and refund the unexpended balances to the SA/BTr.  
 
125. No Management comments on the foregoing audit observations and 
recommendations were received by the Audit Team as of this report.

Inactive/dormant cash not reverted to Bureau of the Treasury - ₱1,573,386.18. 
 
126. Eight (8) bank accounts inactive for a period of three (3) years to more than 
five (5) years under the Cash in Bank-LCCA account, the purposes for which the funds 
were established have been attained but the inactive funds have not been reverted to 
the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr)/Source Agencies (SAs), contrary to COA Circular 
Nos. 94-013 and 2015-001, and Treasury Circular No. 01-2013. 

 
127. COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 provides in its Sections 4.6 
and 4.9 that within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for 
the Project, the IA shall submit the RCI and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the 
utilization of the funds. Only actual project expenses shall be reported. The reports shall 
be approved by the Head of the IA and return to the SA any unused balance upon 
completion of the project. 
 
128. COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015, and Executive Order No. 431 
dated May 30, 2005, requires the reversion to the National Treasury of all dormant 
accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds to the general fund and for other purposes.  

 
129. Sections 3.2 and 3.4 of the Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012, dated 
September 11, 2012, define dormant accounts and unnecessary special and trust funds, 
respectively, as follows: 

 
Dormant accounts – refer to collections authorized by law to be deposited 
with an AGDB but have remained inactive for more than five years. 
 
Unnecessary special and trust funds – refer to authorized special and trust 
funds maintained by government agencies with AGDB but which are no 
longer necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which said funds 
were established, i.e., specific projects/programs, the implementation of 
which have been completed or abandoned.  

 
130. Further, Treasury Circular No. 01-2013 dated January 23, 2013, provides the 
guidelines for: (a) validation of legal basis in opening/maintaining Deposit Accounts; (b) 
monitoring of NGAs compliance with DOF-DBM Joint Letter Policy dated December 12, 
2012 instructing NGAs to close Dormant Accounts and transfer the balances to the 
National Treasury, pursuant to Executive Order No. 431 dated May 30, 2005; and (c) 
closure of unauthorized accounts. 

 
131. The following bank accounts remained inactive for three (3) years to more than five 
(5) years, thus, reiterated:

132. The bank religiously confirms the inactivity of the above bank accounts ranging 
from three (3) years to more than five (5) years. Minimal yearly increase for Bank Account 
Nos. 0702-1062-90, 0702-1050-21 and 0702-1059-35 in the amount of ₱500.24, ₱20.14 
and ₱24.51, respectively, could be attributed to interest earned that were also not recorded 
in the books. 
 
133. On our observation regarding the dormant bank accounts, we have already pointed 
out the issue in our previous year’s audit report but our recommendation remained 
unimplemented due to the failure of the Accountant and the Cashier to conduct a thorough 
evaluation on the need for the maintenance of these bank accounts and the immediate 
reversion of dormant/unnecessary bank accounts to the BTr/SAs as required by regulations. 
Since the bank balances have not been utilized for several years, any information gathered 
may not be relevant any more as these can already be considered as unnecessary trust funds.  
 
134. With reference to the CY 2017 Annual Audit Report (AAR) on the agency, the 
project pertaining to Climate Based Information Support System for Management of the 
Angat-Umiray Reservoir has two (2) years’ project duration with its MOA dated March 6, 
2006; hence, it is presumed to have served its purpose ensuing to more than five (5) years’ 
inactivity of the account.  



66 
 

 
135. The continued retention of idle/unnecessary funds precluded the opportunity for the  
Bureau of the Treasury to maximize the use of scarce government resources by minimizing 
borrowings rationalizing cash management, and using this funds to finance priority 
projects/programs, and expenditures.  
 
136. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant for the 
immediate remittance of the dormant/unnecessary bank accounts totaling 
₱1,573,386.18 to the BTr pursuant to the above-cited regulations. 
  
137. Management commented that the Accounting Unit already prepared the 
disbursement vouchers for the reversion of the dormant account and coordinated with the 
project proponents to prepare and submit the reports required for the completed projects. 
 
138. As a rejoinder, we require the covering JEVs for the reversion of the unnecessary 
bank accounts to the BTr. 
 
Fund transferred to Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) 
 
139. The ₱398 million fund transferred to the DICT remained unliquidated and 
outstanding for over three (3) years under the account Due from NGAs, contrary to 
COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 and Section 63, Chapter 6 of 
the GAM, Volume I, resulting in the non-recognition of the actual expenses incurred 
by the DICT in the implementation of the project; thus, not reflected in the financial 
statements. 

 
140. Paragraph (f) of Section 63, Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume I provides that, “within 
ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, the IA 
shall submit the RCI and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the 
funds.  Only actual project expenses shall be reported.  The reports shall be approved by 
the Head of the IA”. 
 
141. COA Circular No. 2016-015 dated December 19, 2016 also provides that “All 
government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts 
to ensure that these are collected when these become due and demandable and that CA 
and fund transfers are liquidated within the prescribed period depending upon their 
nature and purpose.” Moreover, the Accountant shall, under Section 7.2 thereof, reconcile 
the unliquidated fund transfers between the source and implementing government entities, 
prepare adjusting entries for the reconciling items noted, and require liquidation of 
balances. 

 
142. On December 29, 2016, the DOST and the DICT executed a MOA covering their 
joint collaboration on the implementation of the DOST-PAGASA’s All Weather 
Communication System Program. Under Article III of the MOA, the DOST-PAGASA 
shall transfer the total amount of ₱1,324,239,728.00 to the DICT to cover the two (2) 
phases of the project. 



67 
 

 
143. The MOA further stipulates, among others, that the DICT shall: (a) provide DOST-
PAGASA its network plan/design, blueprint, technical specification, and other related 
materials needed for the planning, implementation, and operationalization of the DOST-
PAGASA Meteorological and Hydrological Telecommunication System; (b) ensure proper 
accounting and reporting for the utilization of the funds under the Program, in accordance 
with the government accounting and auditing rules and regulations, and (c) warrant that all 
administrative and legal procedures and requirements are strictly complied with and 
assumes full accountability for the full and faithful implementation of the terms and 
conditions of the MOA.  Article VIII also provides that the implementation of all terms 
and conditions of the agreement shall take effect upon signing by the parties, and 
henceforth, remain in full force and effect for a period of five (5) years subject to extension 
or upon the program’s completion, turnover and acceptance, whichever comes first, unless 
sooner revoked, canceled or terminated. 

 
144. On the basis of the MOA and ORS No. 06-01101101-2015-12-8065 dated 
December 29, 2015, the DOST-PAGASA transferred to the DICT the total amount of 
₱398 million which was acknowledged by the latter through the issuance of OR No. 
1279722 dated May 17, 2017.  

 
145. The issue on the unliquidated DICT fund transfer has been reported in our Annual 
Audit Report on the PAGASA since CY 2018.  Management commented that the process 
of liquidation cannot be properly made in the books due to the absence of fund utilization 
reports or any progress report by the DICT, despite several requests therefor by PAGASA 
officials. The PAGASA Administrator even came to the point of demanding the return of 
the unused funds in a demand letter dated August 25, 2020, as the fund transferred is intact 
with the BTr with only the amount of ₱20 million that was released as the subject of 
liquidation by the DICT. 

 
146. As reported in the CY 2019 Consolidated Annual Audit Report (CAAR) on the 
DICT, a total of ₱11,179,792.35 was expended from the program funds, out of which 
₱10,001,503.00 was for MOOE and ₱7,462,925.63 or 75 percent of the disbursements for 
MOOE pertained to salaries and wages of contractual personnel assigned at the Project 
Management Office.  

 
147. The project is already on its fourth year of implementation in CY 2020 with target 
completion date in December 2021, but the DICT still showed a low absorptive capacity 
in the implementation of the project as reported in prior years’ audits with accomplishments 
reported in CY 2019 at 2.81 percent or ₱11,179,792.35 out of the ₱398 million fund that 
was transferred. 

  
148. Notwithstanding the existence of the defined policies on the grant, utilization and 
liquidation of fund transfers, if such are not strictly followed, the Due from NGAs account 
will remain unliquidated and the assets and expenses incurred by the DICT in the 
implementation of the project will not be recognized in the books of accounts. Moreover, 
delayed/non-implementation of the project, with the unutilized amount remained deposited 



68 
 

in the BTr, had deprived the attainment of the program’s objective - to provide adequate, 
up-to-date and timely information for the people to prepare for calamities caused by 
typhoons, floods, storm surges, extreme climate events and climate changes to afford 
greater protection. 

 
149. We recommended and Management agreed to make representations with the 
DICT to require its Accountant to immediately submit the liquidation reports to the 
PAGASA for recording of the expenses incurred in the implementation of the project 
following the provisions of the MOA, COA Circular No. 2016-005, and Section 63, 
Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume I.  
 

150. No Management comments on the foregoing audit observations and 
recommendations were received by the Audit Team as of this report. 
 
Payment of Honoraria 
 
151. Payments of honoraria for Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) activities 
amounting to ₱1,866,047.37 included payroll disbursements of ₱159,875.61 to 
ineligible recipients, while honoraria for the implementation of projects in the total 
amount of ₱7,313,039.00 included payments of ₱1,416,000.00 to 15 personnel 
exceeding 25% of their annual salary by ₱213,735.00, contrary to Department of 
Budget and Management (DBM) Circular No. 2004-5, as amended by DBM Circulars 
No. 2004-5A and 2007-3 dated October 7, 2005 and November 29, 2007, respectively. 
Moreover, said payments were not adequately supported as required under COA 
Circular No. 2012-001 and Section 4.6 of PD 1445. 
   
152. Under Section 15 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of 
RA 9184, the Procuring Entity may grant payment of honoraria to the BAC members, 
BAC Secretariat and members of the TWG in an amount not to exceed 25 percent of their 
respective salary subject to availability of funds.   
  
153. DBM Circular No. 2004-5, as amended by DBM Circulars No. 2004-5A and 2007-
3, issued on October 7, 2005 and November 29, 2007, respectively, provides the following 
guidelines on the grant of honoraria to government personnel involved in government 
procurement consistent with the pertinent provisions of RA 9184.   
  

a. Honoraria may be paid only for successfully completed procurement 
projects (emphasis ours). Procurement projects shall be considered completed 
once the contract has been awarded to the winning bidder, and only be limited to 
procurement that involves public bidding.   

  
b. Maximum honorarium per completed procurement project in an amount of 
₱3,000.00 for BAC Chair, ₱2,500.00 for BAC members and ₱2,000.00 for TWG 
Chair and members shall not exceed the rates indicated therein. The average 
honoraria per month over one year shall not exceed 25 percent of the basic salary 
and shall be paid upon completion of each procurement. Members of the BAC 



69 
 

Secretariat, who are performing the attendant functions in addition to their regular 
duties in the non-procurement units of the agency, shall be paid honoraria at the 
same rate with TWG Chair and Members. Heads of government entities are 
prohibited from paying honoraria to personnel involved in procurement activities 
outside of those covered herein.  
  

154. Section 5.7.5 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 also provides that 
the payment of honoraria to officials and employees assigned to special projects are subject 
to the guidelines prescribed under DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 dated October 1, 
2007. Honoraria received from all special projects shall not exceed 25 percent of the annual 
basic salary.  
 
155. Section 4.6 of PD 1445 provides that “Claims against government funds shall be 
supported with complete documentation.” 
 

156. Audit revealed that out of the BAC honoraria disbursements of ₱1,866,047.37 
covering the period September 2018 to August 31, 2019, the amount of ₱159,875.61 
pertained to payments made to end-users and other participants who are not among those 
considered as eligible recipients of honoraria as per the above provisions of DBM Circular 
No. 2004-5. 
 

157. Said disbursements only have the Summary of Attendance Sheet attached to the 
payroll and the following were not attached as required under Section 5.7.5 of COA 
Circular No. 2012-001.  
 

a. Minutes of BAC Meeting  
b. Original copy or certified true copy of contract and Notices of Award and 

to Proceed for the amount being claimed  
c. Certification that the procurement involves competitive bidding  
d. List of completed procurement  

 
158.   In addition, disbursements of honoraria in the amount of ₱6,657,550.00 to 
personnel involved in seven (7) special projects and ₱655,489.00 for other 
programs/activities from October 2018 to December 31, 2019 for a total of ₱7,313,039.00 
were not supported by complete documentations. (See Annex E for details) 
 
159. We also observed that 23 Administration and Finance personnel were likewise 
included in the payment of honorarium under the project Optimization of the Operational 
Capabilities of Hyrdromet Sensors in Line with International Standards (WMO Standards) 
for Effective Weather, Flood Warning (CBFEWS) and Application to Research, 
representing 30% of the 79 technical/project personnel component. Honorarium payment 
to these employees could not be validated if the duties performed are part of their regular 
functions due to the non-submission of actual duties and responsibilities of the payees vis-
à-vis her/his over and above workload assignments in special projects, as provided in 
Section 58 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act of Fiscal Year 
2019,.   

  



70 
 

160. The Special Project Plan was also not submitted, contrary to the provisions of 
Section 4.3 of DBM DOST Joint Circular (JC) No. 1, series of 2013, which states that 
honoraria for assignment in Special Projects may be granted provided that the total 
Honoraria per personnel for a month shall be based on productivity and quality of 
completed and accepted deliverables for the set timeframe. Hence, a special project 
plan shall be prepared, in consultation with all personnel concerned, subject to approval by 
the agency head. Such plan shall contain the following details:  

  
4.3.1.1 Output or deliverables per project component;  
4.3.1.2 Project timetable;  
4.3.1.3 Expected deliverables per personnel;  
4.3.1.4 Estimated cost of monthly honoraria for each personnel based on work 

hours spent beyond the regular work hours.   
  

161. On the other hand, we also noted that honoraria totaling to ₱891,450.00 were paid 
to three (3) personnel involved in more than two (2) projects, contrary to the provisions of 
DOST Memorandum Circular No. 001, Series of 2009 dated March 12, 2009, which states 
that the project staff shall only be allowed to handle not exceeding two (2) projects per 
person while the Program/project coordinator is allowed to a maximum of four (4) projects 
subject for approval of the DOST Execom and/or Funding Agency.  
 
162. Moreover, payments of honoraria in the total amount of ₱1,416,000.00 to 15 
personnel had exceeded the 25% cap of their annual salary by ₱213,735.00. 
 

163. Verification also revealed inconsistencies in the names of the personnel reflected 
in the payrolls and that of the Human Resource records, thus, may cause difficulty in the 
release of the benefits to the payees. 
 

164. The non-submission of the above supporting documents have prevented us from 
determining whether the amounts disbursed for honoraria were authorized and in 
accordance with the computations provided under the DBM Circular.    

  
165. We recommended and Management agreed to:   
  

a. Require the Accountant to submit the necessary supporting documents for 
the Audit Team to be able to make a decision in audit if the computation 
of honoraria payments was based on the provisions of DBM Circulars;  

 
b. Henceforth, strictly comply with DOST Memorandum Circular No. 001 

Series of 2009 dated March 12, 2009 that the project staff shall only be 
allowed to handle not exceeding two (2) projects per person while the 
program/project coordinator is allowed to a maximum of four (4) projects 
subject for approval of DOST Execom and/or Funding Agency and the 
provisions of COA Circular No. 2012-001 and Section 4.6 of PD 1445, that 
honoraria disbursements be adequately supported with proper 
documents; and 

 



71 
 

c. Justify why the following payments of honoraria shall not be suspended or 
disallowed in audit: 

 

i. to end-users/other participants totaling to ₱159,875.61 
 

ii. to 15 personnel in the amount of ₱213,735.00 which was in excess of 
the 25% annual salary requirement; and   

 
iii. to the services of 23 administrative officials in the amount of 

₱529,800.00 when their work is inherent to their regular duties and 
responsibilities. 

 
166. Management commented that the payment of honoraria to end-users is allowed 
under Rule V, Section 11 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 
9184, which states that the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) shall be composed of a 
Regular and a Provisional Member that may be granted honoraria under DBM Budget 
Circular No. 2004-5 dated March 23, 2004. The representative from the end-user becomes 
a provisional member and therefore, as member of the BAC. 
 
167. We maintain that representative/end-users cannot be considered as provisional 
members of the BAC because the provisional member rule applies to those who have 
necessary experience and expertise on the equipment to be acquired; they are specifically 
named as provisional member in the creation of the BAC; and their attendance is only 
required when the said expertise and experience on the said equipment to procure is needed.  
 
168. Management should immediately submit the required documents as basis of the 
Audit Team to arrive at a conclusion in audit. 
 
Delayed/Non-submission of financial reports and other pertinent documents 
 
169. The delayed/non-submission of financial reports, transaction records, Bank 
Reconciliation Statements (BRSs), contracts/purchase orders (POs) and MOA, 
together with the complete documentations, was contrary to the pertinent provisions 
of the GAM and COA Circular Nos. 2009-001/2009-006/95-006/2012-001; and

172. The non-submission of DVs precluded us from evaluating the validity of the 
transactions and propriety of accounting entries made. The said transactions and their 
corresponding accounting treatments, if found improper, may affect the fairness of 
presentation of assets, liabilities and expenses presented in the Agency’s FSs. Likewise, 



73 
 

the reliability of the recorded disbursements cannot be ascertained without the required 
supporting transaction documents.  

  
173. On the other hand, delay in the preparation of the BRSs within the prescribed period 
may result in discrepancies/errors or other reconciling items not promptly 
corrected/adjusted which could affect the correctness of the balances of the cash accounts.  
  
174. Management should take regard of the rule that the non-submission of financial 
reports/transaction documents, perfected POs/Work Orders (WOs) and request/notice of 
delivery of items procured for inspection within the prescribed period is contrary to the 
pertinent provisions of the GAM and COA Circular No. 2009-001, which affects the timely 
evaluation and the early detection of deficiencies, and reporting of audit results to 
Management.    

 
175. We have also noted that the PO numbering was not in accordance with the 
requirements of Appendix 61, GAM, Volume III which should be year, month and serial 
number (one series for each year). 
  
176. Moreover, the financial and liquidation reports of projects submitted for audit were 
not adequately supported with the pertinent MOA. Details are presented in Table 26 on the 
amount of ₱2,000,126.41.

177. Thus, disbursements reported thereat could not be validated as to whether the 
expenses incurred were in accord with the intent or purpose of the project, which is contrary 
to the provision of Section 4.6of PD 1445 which states that the transfer of 
funds/liquidations shall be adequately supported with the basic documentary requirements 
enumerated under Section 3 of COA Circular No. 2012-001, to wit:  

  
a. Necessary supporting documents depending on the nature of transactions or copy of 

MOA/Trust Agreement or copy of OR upon receipt of funds transferred  
 

b. Copy of OR issued by the SA evidencing refund of unexpended/unutilized balance 
of fund transfer  

 
178. The submission of the MOA could facilitate the audit to determine whether the 
funds were utilized on what the parties had agreed upon and whether the project objectives 
and outputs were attained/accomplished. Hence, the non-submission of the pertinent MOA, 
which was already raised in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report, could warrant the 
immediate issuance of a Notice of Suspension on related disbursements, if not yet 
submitted. 
 
179. It is worth mentioning that Section 122 (2) of PD 1445 provides that the unjustified 
failure on the part of the official or employee concerned to submit the documents and 
reports mentioned herein shall be considered a ground for automatic suspension of payment 
of his salary until he shall have complied with the aforesaid requirements, without 
prejudice to any disciplinary action that may be instituted against him.    
 
180. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

 
a. The Chief Accountant to: 

 
i. immediately submit the financial reports, transaction records, Bank 

Reconciliation Statements (BRSs), contracts/purchase orders (POs) 
and MOA with adequate documentation; and 
 

ii. henceforth, strictly observe the prompt submission of financial 
reports for timely verification by the Audit Team and to promptly 
effect corrections/adjustments as necessary and appropriate; 
otherwise, the provisions of Section 122 (2) of PD 1445 on the 
automatic suspension of the salary and other emoluments of the 
concerned officials/personnel shall be imposed; and  

 
b. The Chief of the Procurement Unit to strictly follow the numbering of POs 

as instructed in Appendix 61 of the GAM, Volume III. 
 
181. Management explained that the Accounting Unit was able to process only a 
minimum number of transactions due to the quarantine restrictions and the suspension of 



75 
 

public transportation. Moreover, the work from home (WFH) arrangement has the 
disadvantage of slow to no internet connection in the access of the eNGAS. 

 
182. The preparation of the unsubmitted BRS will be submitted as soon as possible. In 
2020, Management implemented a process wherein, before closing the books in eNGAS, 
the Accounting Unit verifies the amount and the transaction in the Cash-in-Bank SL with 
the total amount reported in the utilization report and with the actual vouchers paid, which 
can aid in the bank reconciliation process. 
 
183. Copies of the MOAs for some PAGASA projects, which the Accountant gathered 
from the project proponents, were already submitted/sent through email on August 3, 2020. 
Retrieval of other documents will be continued in order to facilitate the full liquidation of 
completed PAGASA projects and the conduct of audit by COA. 
 
184. As a rejoinder, Management should devise a plan on how they can perform their 
responsibilities in spite of the current situation. Skeletal work arrangement should be 
mandatory so as not to paralyze government operations.  

 
185. Thus, we require the submission of the remaining MOA and other financial reports 
with adequate documentation to ascertain propriety of the recorded disbursements.  
 
Lists of all Government Projects/Programs/Activities (GPPA) not submitted 
 
186. PAGASA failed to submit the list of all projects, programs and activities at the 
beginning of the year as well as to provide appropriate information in the 
implementation of 26 infrastructure projects totaling ₱557,401,694.60 reported in the 
GPPA as of December 31, 2020, contrary to item 2.1 of COA Circular No. 2013-004.   
 
187. Item 2.1 of COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 2014 provides that, “At 
the beginning of the year, all government agencies shall provide their respective assigned 
Supervising Auditors and Audit Team Leaders with a list of all on-going government 
projects/programs/activities (“PPA”) and those that are to be implemented during the 
year. The list shall include the project name; implementing unit, office or division if it is 
not the agency as a whole; brief description of the PPA; contractor or supplier, if any; 
mode of procurement; funding source; cost or approved budget; project duration including 
start and completion dates; and location.” 

 
188. Moreover, Item 3.2 of the Circular states that “the Project Status should be 
maintained as current as possible and updated using the format provided by COA.” 
 
189. One of the rationales in the issuance of the above Circular is quoted, to wit: 
“Subject to reasonable conditions prescribed by law, the State adopts and implements a 
policy of full disclosure of all transactions involving public interest (Section 28, Article II, 
1987 Philippine Constitution) and recognizes the right of the people to information on 
matters of public concern (Section 7, Article IJI, 1987 Philippine Constitution).” 
 



76 
 

190. The above regulations are consistent with the transparency seal provision of Section 
94 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020 
requiring the submission of the quarterly reports on its Financial and Physical 
Accomplishments.  

 
191. The agency failed to comply with the above provisions on the submission at the 
beginning of the year of all the lists of all on-going government PPAs, both for CYs 2019 
and 2020, as they assumed that the GPPA ending balances for the year could be considered 
as the beginning balances of the ensuing year.  
 
192. The quarterly reports were submitted as required by the Audit Team, however, 
some were devoid of appropriate and important information, such as: 

 
a. the reasons for the delays in the completion of projects;  
b. percentages of completion compared to when it should be completed; and 
c. some of the starting dates provided in the reports were later than the dates of 

the completion of projects and /or the revision on the completion date was ahead 
of its original date.   

 
193. Non-compliance with the requirement on the submission of the list of all on-going 
government PPA and those that are to be implemented during the year had precluded the 
Audit Team from the timely validation and submission of the Quarterly Report on the 
Publicized GPPA, in conformance with the State’s adoption and implementation of a full 
disclosure policy on all transactions involving public interest and recognition of the right 
of the people to information on matters of public concern.  

 
194. We recommended that Management (a) comply strictly with the requirement 
of the yearly submission of the list of all the Agency’s PPAs to the Auditors’ Office at 
the beginning of the year, and (b) submit quarterly the project status of all the on-
going GPPAs with complete details/information, as per COA Circular No. 2013-004. 
 
195. Management still has not complied with COA Circular No. 2013-004 on the 
submission of lists of all programs, plans, projects at the beginning of the year. The 
requirement is also consistent with the transparency seal requirement under Section 94, 
General Provisions, of the FY 2020 GAA, otherwise known as RA 11520. However, the 
GPPA quarterly reports on the project status of all the on-going PPAs were submitted to 
the Audit Team by the responsible officials on June 10, July 1, September 23 and December 
22, 2020, for the 1st to the 4th quarters of CY 2020, respectively. 
 
Disbursements not adequately supported contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001 and the 
MOA provisions 
 
196. Transactions in the amount of ₱1,404,430.84 were paid without the 
appropriate documentation, contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 
2012; taxes withheld in the amount of ₱52,325.56 were not remitted to the Bureau of 
Internal Revenue (BIR) and the amount of ₱13,136.61 was not refunded to the 



77 
 

Department of Agriculture - Bureau of Soil and Water Management (DA-BSWM). 
Moreover, the amount of ₱3,500,000.00 received from BSWM was not acknowledged 
through the issuance of an official receipt, contrary to the provisions of the MOA and 
COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994.  
 
197. On July 24, 2017, a MOA was signed by and between the PAGASA and the DA-
BSMW for the implementation of research and development project and other uses that 
will benefit or aid the Corn Program Project of the latter with a total budget of 
₱3,500,000.00 from July 24, 2017 until terminated. 

 
198. On October 26, 2017, the amount of ₱3,500,000.00 was transferred directly by the 
DA-BSWM to the PAGASA’s Bank Account No. 0702-1079-46; however, no Official 
Receipt (OR) was issued by the latter to acknowledge receipt of the amount transferred, 
contrary to Article 1.1 of the MOA, that “the PAGASA shall acknowledge the receipt of 
the fund by issuing an OR in the name of BSWM in the amount of ₱3,500,000.00.” 

 
199. Moreover, the confirmation letter received from the DA-BSWM Auditor showed 
that the amount transferred had an unliquidated balance in the amount of ₱1,945,269.13 as 
of June 30, 2020. Meanwhile, PAGASA had reported an unexpended balance of 
₱1,554,730.87 and expenditures of ₱1,945,269.13 in the Financial Reports (FRs) as at 
December 31, 2018 submitted to DA-BSWM for the implementation of “Project CHARM 
(Cloud Harvesting and Artificial Rain Making)”. 
 
200. Verification of the covering paid Disbursement Vouchers showed that the amount 
of ₱1,879,806.96 was expended as of June 30, 2019.

201. Out of the ₱1,879,806.96 paid transactions, however, the amount of ₱1,404,430.84 
was disbursed/paid despite the lack of adequate documentation which was not in 
consonance with the provisions on the basic documentary requirements to support 
disbursement transactions under COA Circular No. 2012-001 (details in Annex F).  
 
202. Further review disclosed that stipulations in the MOA were also not complied with 
by the concerned PAGASA officials, under Article 1 on the Obligation of the Parties which 
states: 

xxxx 
 

5. Share findings of the research to BSWM; and 



78 
 

6. Submit quarterly report to BSWM both physical and financial for periodic 
assessment of activities and its fund utilization; 

  
203. Refund of ₱1,554,730.87 under Check No. 1674508 dated July 3, 2019, was 
recorded in the books under JEV No. 2019-07-002638 dated July 3, 2019, that was 
acknowledged by the BSWM through the issuance of OR No. 0929851 dated July 15, 2019.  

 
204. We also noted that for failure of the Accountant to monitor the taxes withheld from 
the transactions, only ₱55,677.87 out of the taxes withheld of ₱108,003.43 was remitted, 
thus, the amount of ₱52,325.56 remained unremitted as of this report, as shown in Table 
28 below.

TOTAL  108,003.43 55,677.87 52,325.56 

 
205. In view of the above information, the ₱3,500,000.00 funds received from the DA-
BSWM still has remaining unutilized funds of ₱65,462.17, representing unremitted taxes 
withheld of ₱52,325.56 and ₱13,136.61 for excess funds not yet returned to the BSWM. 
 
206. The non-issuance of OR is not only contrary to the MOA provisions but is also a 
violation of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994, which states that the IA 
shall issue an OR as an acknowledgement.   

 
207. Similarly, the excess funds not returned to the BSWM also contravenes the MOA 
provisions and COA Circular No. 94-013 on the return of excess funds to the SA. 

 
208. Moreover, the non-submission of documents not only disregarded COA Circular 
No. 2012-001 on the basic documentary requirements for paid transactions but it also 
prevented the Audit Team from checking the veracity of the reported disbursements.  
 
209. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

 
a. Immediately submit the: 

 
i. lacking documents for the Audit Team to evaluate and decide in 

audit whether or not the reported disbursements of ₱1,404,430.84 
are in order;  
 

ii. Physical status reports of the Cloud Seeding Operation (CSO) 
project as required under Section 6 Article 1 of the MOA; 

 



79 
 

iii. Findings and recommendation on the completed research CSO 
project as required in Article 1.5 of the MOA; and  

 
b. Immediately remit the taxes withheld in the amount of ₱52,325.56 and 

refund the excess funds of ₱13,136.61 to the DA-BSWM. 
 
210. Henceforth, we also recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a.  the Collecting Officer to issue covering Official Receipts (OR) for 
acknowledgement of all funds received from all sources; and 
 

b.  the Accountant to report to the SA actual expenditures in the 
implementation of the project following the provision of COA Circular No. 
94-013 dated December 13, 1994.  

 
211. Management commented that the documents related to travel expense 
disbursements were already submitted together with the liquidation reports. Supporting 
documents for other disbursements listed were already communicated to the project 
proponents. 
 
212. In a letter-reply dated December 4, 2020, Management requested 60 days within 
which to submit the documents and the physical report, status and recommendation as 
required in the MOA between the DA-BSWM and PAGASA. 
 
213. With regard to the remittance of taxes withheld, Management submitted the 
correct/revised recapitulation and Report of Checks Issued (RCI) to substantiate that all 
taxes withheld were remitted to the PAGASA National Window Account and all tax 
liabilities were paid.  
 
Deficiencies on Cash Management 
 
214. We verified the cash and accounts of AOs in lieu of the regular conduct of cash 
examination and we noted the following deficiencies: 
 

a. Petty Cash Fund (PCF) 
 
i. Excessive grants of CAs to Petty Cash Fund Custodians (PCFCs) 

 
215. Cash Advances granted to PCFCs were excessive, contrary to Section 4.3.1 of 
COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, which states that the CA shall be 
sufficient for the recurring expenses of the agency for one (1) month, and exposing 
government funds to the risk of possible losses through theft or misuse.  

 
216. Section 4.3.1 COA Circular No. 97-002 states that for Petty Operating Expenses - 
the CA shall be sufficient for the recurring expenses of the agency for one month. The 
Accountable Officer (AO) may request replenishment of the CA when the disbursements 



80 
 

reach at least 75%, or as the need requires, by submitting a replenishment voucher with all 
supporting documents duly summarized in a Report of Disbursement (RD).  

 
217. The excessive grant of Cash Advances (CAs) was already noted in the previous 
years’ audit of various PCFCs that resulted in the reduction of the grant from ₱60,000.00 
to ₱30,000.00 for one of the AOs recently examined, while the other PCFCs had fully 
liquidated their respective CAs and were no longer granted any CA in CY 2020.  

 
218. The following disbursements ranging from four (4) months to seven (7) months 
showed that the CAs granted were excessive, contrary to the above regulation that the grant 
shall be sufficient for the one (1)-month requirement of the office.

219. It can be gleaned from the above table that the amount of CAs granted to the three 
(3) PCFCs were 1,601 percent, 400 percent and 1,139 percent, over the respective average 
monthly disbursements of their offices. 

 
220. It is also worthy to note that the excess CAs in the possession of the PCFCs for over 
a year also indicated excessive grants, thus, exposing government funds to the risk of 
possible losses through theft or misuse.  
 
221. We recommended and Management agreed to immediately reduce the grant 
of PCF to an amount sufficient for the monthly operating requirements of the office.

222. No Management comments on the foregoing audit observations and 
recommendations were received by the Audit Team as of this report. 
 

ii. Delayed submission of liquidation reports (AO 3) and incomplete supporting 
documents (AO 1) 

 
223. The PCF account balance of AO 3 amounting to ₱100,000.00 as of December 
31, 2020, was inaccurate due to unliquidated balance or submission of liquidation 
reports beyond the reglementary period as prescribed under Sections 5.1.2/5.1 of 
COA Circular No. 97-002. Moreover, various transactions of AO 1 totaling  
₱50,845.00 were not supported by adequate documentation in violation of Section 4.6 
of PD 1445. 

 
224. The liquidation reports (LRs) pertaining to the ₱100,000.00 PCF of AO 3 was 
submitted to the Accounting Office only on January 13, 2021, or 10 months after the grant 
on February 18, 2020, due to the failure of the errand personnel/end-users to surrender the 
receipts for expenses incurred and to return the excess cash to the AO resulting in the 
delayed preparation of the LR, contrary to the following Sections of COA Circular No. 97-
002 dated February 10, 1997: 

  
Section 5.1.2 – Petty Operating Expenses and Field Operating Expenses – within 

20 days after the end of the year; subject to replenishment as 
frequently as necessary during the year.  

 
Section 5.1 -   When a CA is no longer needed or has not been used for a period of 

two (2) months, it must be returned to or refunded immediately to 
the collecting officer. 

 
225. Moreover, post-audit revealed various deficiencies on inadequate documentation 
of disbursements to support the validity of the paid transactions, contrary to Section 4.6 of 
PD 1445, that Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete 
documentation, to wit: 
 

1. Certification on over the counter purchase was signed blindly by the concerned 
official since it has no adequate information such as OR no., kind and amount of 
items purchased, etc.; 
 

2. No authority to avail cell card allowances and amount of cell card allotted to each 
member; 

  
3. No agenda and minutes of the meeting attached on meals purchased; and 

 
4. No pre- and post-repair inspections for emergency procurement of spare parts. 

 



82 
 

226. The delayed submission of liquidation reports resulted in the understatement of the 
covering expenses for the period and the overstatement of the recorded PCF account as at 
year-end.  
 
227. We also noted that an amount of ₱3,800.00 was granted to a concerned errand 
personnel on February 7, 2020, however, the OR on even date was only presented after 
five (5) months or on July 7, 2020. The long delay in the surrender of the OR by the errand 
personnel to the AO resulted in the delayed submission and recording of the LRs in the 
books.  

 
228. The amount of ₱9,239.25 in the possession of the concerned errand personnel is the 
accountability of the PCFC, the only person who has sole responsibility for custodianship 
of this. Moreover, cash retained by the errand personnel could not be used for the 
subsequent procurement of items urgently needed by the PAGASA, and is not in accord 
with the purpose of the grant, aside from the fact that the fund is exposed to risk of loss or 
misuse or loss of ORs, if not submitted to the PCFC immediately. 

 
229. Moreover, the control number in the PCV was accomplished only upon the 
submission of the ORs and refund of unexpended cash by the concerned personnel, thus, it 
failed to show the actual sequential numbering of issued PCVs and actual date of released 
of funds. 

 
230. We recommended and Management agreed to require the PCFC to: 

 
a. enjoin the concerned errand personnel to submit the ORs and to 

immediately return the remaining or unused cash to the PCFC on the day 
of purchase or on the next working day;  
 

b. timely prepare and submit LRs to the Accounting Unit for recording in 
the books; and  

 
c. accomplish the PCV with sequential numbering indicating the actual date 

of the release of cash to concerned personnel for control purposes.   
 

231. No Management comments on the foregoing audit observations and 
recommendations were received by the Audit Team as of this report. 

 
iii. Disbursements exceeding the ₱15,000.00 threshold (AO 2) 
 

232. The PCF was used for payments exceeding the ₱15,000.00 threshold per 
transaction, contrary to Section 4.3.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002. 

 
233. Section 4.3.2 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 states that 
payments out of the CA shall be allowed only for amounts not exceeding ₱15,000.00 for 
each transaction, except when a higher amount is allowed by law and/or specific authority 



83 
 

by the Commission on Audit. Splitting of transactions to avoid exceeding the ceiling shall 
not be allowed. 

 
234. Audit revealed that the PCFC failed to comply strictly with the above regulations, 
as shown in Table 30 for disbursements totalling of ₱111,550.42 exceeding the ₱15,000.00 
threshold per transaction.

235. In addition, there were three (3) purchases out of the PCF totaling ₱16,398.00, 
which were construed as split purchases since these were done on the same day, with 
sequential OR Nos. under one (1) supplier and purpose. Details are presented below:

   TOTAL 16,398.00 

 
236. The use of PCF for expenses more than ₱15,000.00 not only violates Section 4.3.2 
of COA Circular No. 97-002  dated February 10, 1997 but can also easily deplete the PCF 
in the hands of the PCFC which is mostly needed for purchases of small amounts. 
 
237. We recommended and Management agreed to require the PCFC to strictly 
observe the ₱15,000.00 threshold on PCF disbursements per transaction as required 
under COA Circular No. 97-002; and to stop splitting purchases and directly pay the 
supplier with checks for transactions exceeding ₱15,000.00.  
 
238. No Management comments on the foregoing audit observations and 
recommendations were received by the Audit Team as of this report. 
 

iv. SL/GL not updated 
 



84 
 

239. Appendix 6, Volume II of the GAM states that, “At the end of each month, after all 
transactions in the journals have been posted, the debit and credit columns of each account 
shall be footed xxx. The totals of the SL balances shall be reconciled with the 
corresponding GL controlling account.” 
 
240. We noted that the Subsidiary Ledgers per PCFC were not yet updated despite that 
the LRs were submitted, recorded in the books and forwarded to the Audit Team due to 
inadequate control in reconciling both ledgers, thus, the latest records of SL/GL pertained 
only to CY 2020 transactions. 
  
241. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
maintain updated Subsidiary Ledgers which should be reconciled with the controlling 
accounts in the General Ledger at the end of each month. 
 
242. No Management comments on the foregoing audit observations and 
recommendations were received by the Audit Team as of this report. 
 

b. Cash Advances (CAs) 
 

v. Excessive grant and the non-liquidation of CA on time 
 

243. The grant of excess CA for special time-bound undertaking and unutilized 
cash not refunded after the purpose of the CA has been served, contrary to Section 
4.1.3 of COA Circular No. 97-002, may result in the possible loss of funds through 
personal use or misappropriation. 
 
244. Section 4.1.3 of COA Circular No. 97-002, dated February, 1997 provides that “a 
CA shall be reported as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served.” 

 
245. The AO was granted CA of ₱889,000.00 on November 26, 2019 and the amount 
₱755,970.66 was utilized for the conduct of CY 2019 Year-End Christmas Party held on 
December 13, 2019. The excess cash of ₱133,029.34 was refunded only on February 10, 
2020 under Official Receipt No. 7228147 or almost two (2) months after the event due to 
Management’s failure to enforce the timely submission of LRs. The practice is not in 
conformity with the above provision of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 
that the unutilized CAs should be immediately refunded as soon as the purpose for which 
it was granted has been served. 

 
246. The observation on the grant of CAs in excess of the needs of the office was already 
reported in the previous years but it was still noted during the year, thus, resulting in 
unutilized funds for almost two (2) months in the hands of the AO who did not immediately 
refund and that could lead to possible loss through personal use or misappropriation. 
 
 
 
 
 



85 
 

247. We recommended and Management agreed to, henceforth, require: 
 

a. The concerned office to meticulously estimate the funds needed for 
activities to be financed by a CA in order to ensure that the amounts 
granted are not excessive; and  

 
b. The AO to immediately refund unused CA balance as soon as the purpose 

for which the CA was granted has already been served. 
 
248. No Management comments on the foregoing audit observations and 
recommendations were received by the Audit Team as of this report. 
 

vi. Lacking information/documents to support expenditures relative to CY 2019 
Year-end Recognition/Christmas Party 

 
249. Expenses incurred out of the CAs could not be validated due to inadequate 
documentation to determine authority/validity of liquidations recorded.  
 
250. Section 4.6 of PD 1445 states that “Claims against government funds shall be 
supported with complete documentation.” 

 
251. The recorded liquidation report for the 2019 Year-end Recognition/Christmas party 
lacked Official Receipts and the following supporting documents/information, which is not 
in conformity with the above-mentioned provision: 
 

1. Purchases exceeding the ₱15,000.00 limit or threshold in the amount of ₱30,500.00 
and ₱36,760.00 were paid out of the CA instead of by check, in violation of Section 
2 of COA Circular No. 97-002. 

2. Some purchase requests (PRs) and the Petty Cash Voucher (PCV) for CA released 
to errand personnel were undated; thus, it cannot be determined if the official 
receipts and excess cash, to support the release of funds through PCFV, was 
immediately presented to the AO.   

3. Some paid expenses were written only in a piece of paper instead of the presentation 
of the required Official Receipts. 

4. Token/Christmas gifts to some 80 recipients were considered as unnecessary and 
in violation of Administrative Order No. 103 in the adoption of austerity measures 
reiterated under AO 006 dated September 19, 2017. 

5. Meal expenses before and after the activity were charged to the CA when the 
PAGASA personnel were already granted their daily Subsistence Allowance, thus, 
would constitute double payment or unnecessary expenditures. 

6. Transportation expenses charged against the funds when service vehicle was 
provided during the pandemic. 
 

252. Thus, the Audit Team could not validate the authority and validity of the above 
expenses paid out of the CAs due to the absence of the above information/documents.  
 



86 
 

253. Moreover, Administrative Order No. 006 for the continued adoption of austerity 
measures in the government to undertake cost-cutting measures for purposes of reducing 
expenses and channeling its scarce resources, in order to attain a sound budget policy 
and ensure a balanced budget especially during this pandemic was also not observed 
with some of the expenses enumerated above charged against the CAs. 
 
254. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

 
a. Immediately submit the lacking information/documents to ensure 

validity/authority of expenditures;  
 

b. Justify why unnecessary expenses such as the cost of distributed tokens 
and those expenses that were not supported by valid receipts should not 
be disallowed in audit; and 

 
c. Strictly comply with the provisions of AO No. 006 on adopting austerity 

measures in the government spending out of the CAs. 
 
255. No Management comments on the foregoing audit observations and 
recommendations were received by the Audit Team as of this report. 
 

vii. Unreliable year-end balances of unliquidated CAs 
 
256. Advances to SDOs and Advances to Officers and Employees totaling 
₱960,735.99 and ₱909,232.55, respectively, were not liquidated at the end of the year, 
contrary to COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997, resulting in the 
accumulation of unliquidated CAs. 

 
257. Item 5.8 of COA Circular 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides that “All CAs 
shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year. Except for petty cash fund, the AO shall 
refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the 
necessary official receipt.” 
 
258. Records showed that as of December 31, 2020, unliquidated CAs of ₱960,735.99 
were granted for specific undertakings while a total amount of ₱909,232.55 were granted 
for local travels made by various employees, as shown below.

259. Referring to items 31 to 33 in the preceding table, we noted that only one (1) out of 
the three (3) employees, was able to refund the CA granted for their travel to Daet and Pili 
Stations scheduled on March 16-28, 2020, which coincided with the imposed total 
lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CA granted under ADA No. 20030599 for 
item 33 was refunded under OR No. 6697816 dated March 4, 2021. Thus, the need for the 
immediate refund for CAs under items 31-32. 
 
260. Management, in its desire to comply with the various rules and regulations for the 
immediate liquidation of CAs, required all AOs to submit a waiver on the grant for 
foreign/local travels and Petty/Field Operating Expenses, quoted to wit: 

 
“Pursuant to Section 5.1 of COA Circular 97-002, I commit and 

hereby agree to liquidate the CA within the specified period as follows: 
 

a) Petty Operating Expenses and Field Operating Expenses – within twenty (20) 
days after the end of the year; subject to replenishment as frequently as 
necessary during the year; 
 

b) Official travel – within sixty days (60) after the return to the Philippines, in 
the case of foreign travel or within thirty (30) days after the return to 
permanent official station in the case of local travel, as provided for in EO 
248, COA Circular No. 96-004 and COA Circular 2012-001 and GAM Vol. 
1 Sec. 25b.  
 

Failure to liquidate the received amount within the prescribe period 
will constraint the office to withhold my salary until such time that the CA 
has been fully liquidated, as provided for under paragraph 9.2 and 9.3 of 
COA Circular 97-002. 
 

I further committed, that in the event that I failed to liquidate after 3 
weeks my salary had been withheld, this Office, will start implement 
deduction from my withheld salary until such time until full amount of CA is 
fully settled.” 
 



89 
 

261. However, unutilized CAs had always been emphasized in the yearly audits which 
shows that the waiver, as a tool of Management, was not beneficial or does not seem to 
have served the purpose on the immediate liquidation of CAs. 
 
262. The non-liquidation of CAs at the end of the year, due to Management’s failure to 
enforce timely liquidation of CAs, is not only contrary to COA Circular No. 97-002 dated 
February 10, 1997, but it also deprived the Audit Team from the timely conduct of post-
audit to determine whether the CAs were used in accordance with the purpose for which 
these were granted and if supported with complete documentation. 
 
263. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

 
a. enjoin the concerned AOs to immediately submit their travel documents 

as proof that the travel has been concluded; otherwise, require the 
immediate refund of the CA granted; 

 
b. conduct a briefing of AOs on the proper handling and liquidation of CAs, 

instead of the waiver tool, to be able to strictly comply with the provisions 
of COA Circular No. 97-002 on the immediate settlement/liquidation of 
CAs; and 

 
c. record all the unrecognized refunds in the books of accounts and demand 

the full refund of the unexpended CA balances; otherwise, the salaries of 
the concerned AOs shall be withheld pursuant to COA Circular No. 97-
002. 

 

264. No Management comments on the foregoing audit observations and 
recommendations were received by the Audit Team as of this report. 
 

viii. Posting errors in subsidiary ledger (SL) of Accountable Officers (AOs) 
 
265. Aside from the errors noted in recording CA transactions, posting errors 
contributed to negative SL balances of AOs, thereby, causing difficulties in 
establishing the individual unliquidated balances of AOs.  
 
266. Section 27, Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume I states that, “The Accounting 
Division/Unit shall record the JEV in the GJ and maintain SL/IP for officers and employees 
where the granting and liquidation of travel allowances shall be posted for monitoring 
purposes”. 
 
267. Majority of the posting errors observed were CY 2019 transactions that the 
Accountant failed to address due to its volume and complexity in matching the grant 
against the liquidation/refund. Unaccustomed accounting personnel in the newly 
implemented eNGAS in CY 2019 was the main reason for the said deficiency. Hence, 
veracity of the unliquidated balances of CAs, with reference to the AOs’ individual SLs, 
could not be ascertained. 



90 
 

268. We also noted the maintenance of five (5) additional SLs, one (1) for Advances to 
SDOs account and four (4) for Advances to Officers and Employees account, whereas, CA 
transactions were temporarily posted for later adjustment/reclassification to the specific SL 
of AOs. This practice weakens monitoring control for more accurate and reliable balances 
of AOs’ individual SLs. 
 
269. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

 
a. Perform detailed review of the recorded JEVs for the grant and 

liquidation of CAs if these were posted appropriately to the specific SLs of 
AOs and  correct all the posting errors noted; and 

 
b. Henceforth, train and supervise the accounting personnel on the use of 

eNGAS and post all transactions directly to the individual SLs of AOs 
based on original source documents and avoid using temporary SLs for 
subsequent adjustments to the specific SL of AOs. 

 
270. No Management comments on the foregoing audit observations and 
recommendations were received by the Audit Team as of this report. 
 
Compliance with the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) 
 
271. Management’s failure to immediately enforce COA Order of Execution (COE) 
on Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 2005-034 dated September 9, 2005, rendered 
subsequent payments of salaries and allowances to persons liable for the ND, 
disallowable in audit to the extent of the unsettled amount of ₱5,153,000.00, wherein 
the Agency Head and the Agency Cashier are to be held liable therefor, pursuant to 
the instructions in COA Order of Execution No. 2019-022 dated March 20, 2019 and 
the 1987 Administrative Code. 

 
272. Management, on the belief that the disallowances are not yet enforceable awaiting 
CP decision, had also not taken any action to enforce settlement of disallowances from the 
persons liable on the basis of the COE issued by the COA Legal Services Sector, Office of 
the General Counsel, contrary to COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 
prescribing the use of the RRSA, which defines Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) and 
COE under Section 4.18 and 4.12, respectively, the former as “a written notification that a 
decision of the COA has become final and executory,” and the latter as “a written 
instruction to withhold payment of salary and other money due to persons liable, for 
settlement of their liability.” 

 
273. Further, Section 7.1.3 thereof instructs that the Agency Head “xxx shall enforce the 
COE by requiring the withholding of salaries or other compensation due the person liable 
in satisfaction of the disallowance or charge.” 

 



91 
 

274. The continuous disregard of enforcing settlement of the disallowed CNA despite 
the issuance of the COE will constrain us to issue another disallowance making the Agency 
Head and the Cashier liable for the said ND in the amount of ₱5,153,000.00. 

 
275. We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Cashier to 
immediately withhold the payment of salaries or any amount due to the persons held 
liable in ND No. 2005-034 dated September 9, 2005, and cause the collection or 
settlement of the same directly from any of the liable persons in case they are no 
longer in the government; otherwise, the corresponding unwithheld salaries at a 
collective sum of ₱5,153,000.00 will be disallowed in audit and the Agency Head, 
together with the Agency Cashier, will be held liable therefor.  
 
276. Management commented that the following will be undertaken: (a) Instruct the 
Cashier to determine the amount due from each employee (active or retired) and effect the 
deduction from any payment due to active employees in monthly installments as stated in 
COA Resolution No. 2017-021 dated November 3, 2017; and (b) send demand letter with 
return card to retired employees concerned at their last known addresses, copies of which 
will be furnished to COA. Lastly, since we are in a state of pandemic, Management requests 
for ample time to effect the deductions from employees concerned to begin January 2021 
so that PAGASA Weather Employees Association (PWEA) officers could consult and 
disseminate the actions of Management. 
 
277. As a rejoinder, the Audit Team recommends the immediate settlement of the ND 
by requesting from the Commission, authority to settle in installment basis the said 
disallowances through monthly salary deduction pursuant to Section 8 of COA Resolution 
No. 2017-021 dated November 3, 2017.  
 
Employees with unsettled disallowances were granted retirement clearance 
 
278. Eighty-six (86) personnel of the Agency were granted retirement clearances 
and were paid their terminal leave (TL) claims without settlement of their liabilities 
on the disallowed payments of Longevity Pay (LP) in CY 2015 and the Collective 
Negotiation Agreement (CNA) in CYs 2003-2004, 2009 to 2011 totalling 
₱18,237,176.85 and ₱37,286,000.91, respectively, contrary to Section 7.1.4 of COA 
Circular No. 2009-006.  
 
279. Various Notices of Disallowances (NDs) on the questionable payments of CNA 
falling short of the mandatory requirements under the provisions of law for CYs 2003-2004 
and there being no appeal filed within the reglementary period for CYs 2009 to 2011, 
disallowances totalling ₱37,286,000.91 have become final and executory with the issuance 
of the Notices of Finality of Decision (NFD), while the NDs on CNA Incentives in CYs 
2003 and 2004 in the amount of ₱5,153,000.00, COA Order of Execution No. 2019-022 
was issued on March 20, 2019, but to date no amount has been collected yet from the 
persons liable. 

 



92 
 

280. Moreover, a total amount of ₱18,237,176.85 for the payments of LP in CY 2015 
was disallowed in audit in CY 2018 under 16 NDs due to erroneous computation. It is also 
worthy to note that only ND No. 18-01-(2015) dated April 6, 2018; and ND No. 18-02- 
(2015) dated April 23, 2018, in the amount of ₱754,320.98 and ₱1,037,922.53, respectively 
were appealed by Management before the Commission on Audit (COA) on May 22, 2019. 
 
281. Pending the finality of decision on their appeal on the LP disallowance, 86 officials 
and personnel have reached their mandatory retirement age in CY 2018 to September 2020. 
Verification revealed that Agency officials have issued and approved the covering 
Clearances from Money and Property Accountability and paid in full the terminal leave 
benefits of these employees totalling to ₱31,539,152.80.  

 
282. The practice is not consistent with Section 7.1.4 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 
dated September 15, 2009, which states that the Head of the agency shall ensure that the 
obligation of retiring officials/personnel for which they are liable including disallowances 
and charges shall first be settled. 

  
283. We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 
a. submit an explanation why they should not be held accountable for the 

non-settlement of the LP/CNA disallowances due from the 86 retired 
personnel, and henceforth, strictly comply with Section 7.1.4 of COA 
Circular No. 2009-006 on the immediate settlement of all disallowances of 
retiring personnel; and 

 
b. enforce the collection of receivables from the concerned retired personnel.  

 
284. Management explained that considering the pendency and final resolution of  
Management’s Petition for Review or Supplemental Motion or Appeal Memorandum 
before the Commission Proper, they are of the opinion that, enforcement thereof, 
specifically against the subject 86 retired personnel, is not yet ripe; such that the PAGASA 
Management finds no legal impediment to withhold their respective terminal leave benefits 
and released the same, guided by the pertinent provisions of Republic Act No. 10154, 
otherwise known as an “Act Requiring All Concerned Government Agencies to Ensure the  
Early Release of the Retirement Pay, Pensions, Gratuities and Other Benefits of Retiring 
Government Employees,” and its Implementing Rules and Regulations issued by the Civil 
Service Commission (CSC). 
 
285. Further, Management shall enforce collection of receivables from the concerned 
retired officials and personnel for CNA 2003-2004 by way of demand letters with return 
card to be sent to their last known addresses. 
 
286. As a rejoinder, the Audit Team would like to request copies of demand letters sent 
to retired employees, and henceforth, recommend that the Head of the Agency shall ensure 
that obligation of retiring officials/personnel for which they are liable including 



93 
 

disallowances and charges shall first be settled as required under Section 7.1.4 of COA 
Circular No. 2009-006. 
 
287. Moreover, we suggest that Management require retiring employees to authorize the 
deduction from their claims the amount of disallowances and issue a promissory note that 
all disallowances found after their retirement will be settled. 
 

Other Compliance Issues 
 
Gender and Development (GAD) 
 
288. The Agency’s GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) amounting to ₱530,676,140.00 or 
equivalent to 37.59 percent of its appropriation was endorsed to the PCW by DOST while 
eight (8) out of 19 targeted activities were implemented and reported actual expenditures 
of ₱204,252.33 excluding the attributed programs. However, the covering disbursement 
vouchers for the activities conducted nor the GAD Accomplishment Reports were not 
submitted due to the failure of the Accountant and the GAD/Persons with Disability and 
Senior Citizen Committee to immediately submit the same to the Audit Team despite of 
repeated requests.  
 
289. We recommended and Management agreed to submit complete documents to 
support actual GAD activities to validate the accomplishments. 
 
Compliance with Laws on Senior Citizens, Persons with Disability 
 
290. The Agency budgeted ₱3,080,000.00 and implemented five (5) out of 11 targeted 
activities with actual expenditures of ₱67,846.25. However, the covering disbursement 
voucher was not forwarded to the Audit Team. 
 
291. We recommended and Management agreed to submit the complete documents 
to support its activities. Moreover, as reported in the CYs 2018 and 2019 Annual 
Audit Reports, the improvement of comfort room facility for SCs and PWDs for their 
easy mobility, remained not implemented, thus, we require improvement of said 
facility.  
 
Payments of Contractual or Job Order (JO) personnel 
 
292. The Agency hired a total of 185 contractual/JO personnel as at December 31, 2020, 
representing an additional workforce of 23.42 percent of the 790 regular plantilla 
employees. They provide administrative and technical assistance in the implementation of 
agency programs/activities for CY 2020. 
 

293.  PAGASA’s contractual personnel consisted of 185 technical and non-technical 
personnel, 86 are assigned at the Central Office while the other 99 are assigned at the 
various field stations. 

 



94 
 

294. The Agency paid the services of the JO personnel in the total amount of 
₱33,974,175.22 as at December 31, 2020, which were charged against the Maintenance 
and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE). 
 
Compliance on Withholding and Remittances of Regulated Accounts 
 
295. For CY 2020, the Agency deducted from the salaries of its personnel the required 
taxes, premiums/contributions and loan payments and remitted the same as well as the 
government share within the prescribed period to the concerned institution or agencies. A 
summary is shown in Table 34.

to ₱16,321,644.41 which was remitted in January 2021. However, it was also noted 
that out of the taxes withheld for the project Cloud Seeding’s, in the amount of 
₱108,003.43, only ₱55,677.87 was remitted, thus, the amount of ₱52,325.56,
