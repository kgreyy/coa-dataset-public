Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements of the Sorsogon State College for CY 2020 due to the following audit observations:



1)	The total acquisition costs of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) in the amount of ₱763.22 million reported in the financial statements did not reconcile with the total costs reported in the Property Inventory Reports per Property Office in the amount of ₱729.42 million, with unreconciled difference of ₱33.80 million.  



2)	The accuracy of the balances of the Cash in Bank accounts of the College as of December 31, 2020 amounting to ₱215.74 million could not be ascertained in view of the material variance of ₱84.36 million between the book and bank records due to the inability to prepare Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) for all bank accounts and non-maintenance of updated subsidiary ledgers.





Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations



For the exceptions mentioned above, the Auditor recommended that Management: 



1)	Require the Accounting and Supply/Property Office to prioritize the reconciliation process and ensure that discrepancies noted on the reconciliation of PPE records are immediately investigated and adjusted in the books accordingly; and



2)	Instruct the College Accountant to religiously prepare and submit the required Monthly Bank Reconciliation Statements for all the bank accounts of the College in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations and to maintain updated subsidiary ledgers with balances duly reconciled with the general ledger and financial statements.



Moreover, the following are the other notable observations and the corresponding recommendations:



1)	Discrepancies amounting to ₱1.95 million between the balances of Inventory Held for Consumption accounts in the Financial Statement (FS) as compared to the Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs) and non-preparation of SLCs for semi-expendable Property accounts with an aggregate balance of ₱3.42 million, indicating a weak inventory accounting system which casts doubts as to the accuracy and reliability of reported Inventory accounts balances as of December 31, 2020.



We recommended that Management require the Accounting Office to maintain updated and complete SLCs for all the Inventory accounts including Semi-Expendable properties, which shall be reconciled with the controlling accounts in the financial statements and other reports within the Accounting Office.



2)	Fund transfers from National Government Agencies (NGAs) with balances aggregating ₱2.10 million for various completed, unutilized and/or non-moving programs, remained idle and were not returned to the Source Agencies or the National Treasury, thus, depriving the stakeholders of the benefits that could have been derived had these programs been completed as planned and likewise denied the national government of resources that could have been put to better use.



We recommended the following courses of action to Management:



a.	Instruct the Accounting Unit to exert extra effort in the review of financial/liquidation reports, retrieve source documents and other reports covering prior years’ transactions for fund transfers to identify errors made in recording and reconcile with the Accountant of Source Agencies to undertake the adjustments accordingly and reflect the correct balances;



b.	Instruct the implementing Offices concerned and the Accounting Unit to ensure that Financial and/or Liquidation Reports are duly submitted to the Source Agencies for proper recording and reconciliation;



c.	Revisit all the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the respective NGAs, verify all utilizations and confirm final status of projects/programs to determine the proper disposition of unutilized funds. In the absence of MOA, the College thru its implementing offices or departments coordinate with the concerned NGAs to obtain copies of the MOA and confirm/reconcile balances to finally determine the appropriate disposition of such;



d.	Require the Accounting Office and focal offices to submit, henceforth, copies of all MOA/Trust Agreements with other NGAs to the COA Auditor’s Office for audit purposes; and



e.	Initiate the immediate return to Source Agencies or the National Treasury of the reconciled unexpended balances for completed projects and dormant accounts under the Due to NGAs account.



3)	The absence of details/specifics of some of the booked-up Guaranty/Security Deposits Payables in the amount of ₱421,230 and existence of various accounts aged more than three years amounting to ₱0.74 million rendered the account balance unreliable and affected the fair presentation thereof in the financial statements.



We recommended that Management instruct the Accounting Unit to:



a.	Conduct a thorough reconciliation of the outstanding balances reported under the Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable account, especially those lacking with details to ascertain that the goods, services and infrastructure projects covered by the trust liability were indeed fully delivered/completed and no manufacturing and structural defects were detected during the warranty or defects liability period;



b.	Communicate with the suppliers/contractors to establish claims and confirm their interests for refund of the retention money for the related projects with warranty or defects liability period that had already lapsed and are without manufacturing and structural defects detected and for those retained from progress billings to prevent further aging of balances. If warranted, cause the forfeiture of those balances which claims have been waived by the Suppliers; and



c.	Prepare necessary journal entries to adjust and correct the subsidiary ledger balances of those accounts that were already refunded to the Contractors.



4)	Copies of contracts of projects worth ₱75.35 million were not completely supported with the required documents and were not submitted for auditorial review and technical evaluation within the prescribed period, contrary to COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009. Likewise, no requests for technical inspection were submitted for completed projects in the total amount of ₱116.35 million., thus, timely conduct of inspection was not made depriving Management to be informed of the deficiencies, if any, at the earliest time possible.



We recommended that Management take the following courses of action:

	a)	Direct the BAC Secretariat to comply with the regulations and furnish the Auditor with the required copy of contracts with complete supporting documents within the prescribed period for the timely review and evaluation; and 



	b)	Submit letter requests for inspection of completed projects, duly supported with Certificate of Completion and Turn-over and As-Built Plan, to the Audit Team for indorsement to the COA Regional Technical Services Office.



5)	Procurement activities for twenty-six projects with total approved budget of ₱126.95 million were not immediately commenced pursuant to Sec. 7.6 of the IRR of RA No. 9184, thus, resulting in delay in the awarding of contracts to qualified bidders and implementation of the projects which consequently deprived the stakeholders of the timely use thereof. 



We recommended that Management remind the concerned Unit Heads to closely coordinate with the BAC in the observance and commencement of procurement activities, for their proposed projects as planned, in accordance with the provisions of the IRR of RA No. 9184 to ensure their timely award, implementation and completion.

6)	Possible lapses in the post-qualification process led to the award of several infrastructure projects with coinciding project duration to the same contractor with same key personnel assigned and equipment pledged to different projects, thus,  affecting the capability of the contractors to satisfactorily complete the project on time by an average delay of 66 days for seven projects with aggregate contract costs of ₱34.27 million, ultimately depriving the College and other stakeholders of the timely use thereof.



We recommended that Management remind the BAC and its TWG to practice caution in the examination of the contractor’s manpower and equipment on all the projects to be awarded and not on individual project only in case the contractor is the lowest bidder in several projects which have the same or coinciding period of implementation.



7)	The required annual physical inventory count was not conducted due to the non-creation of an Inventory Committee, thus, corresponding RPCPPE was not prepared, contrary to COA Circular No. 80-124 and the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs).



We recommended that Management create an Inventory Committee to conduct the annual physical inventory-taking to facilitate the validation of existence, condition and status of all properties of the College and eventually, the preparation of a complete RPCPPE. 



8)	The College’s Annual Gender and Development (GAD) Plan and Budget was prepared without reference to an established multi-year GAD Framework and Agenda as basis for a strategic planning of activities that will ensure outcomes that are truly responsive to commitments embodied in the Philippine Plan for Gender Responsive Development (PPGD) 1995-2025 and Magna Carta of Women (MCW) towards gender equality and women’s empowerment, as prescribed in the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) Memorandum Circular No. 2018-04 dated May 4, 2018.



We recommended that Management require the GAD Focal Point System, in participation and consultation with concerned beneficiaries and stakeholders, to formulate a six-year GAD Agenda guided by the gender equality and women’s empowerment outcomes and goals embodied in the MCW and PPGD 1995-2025.





The afore-cited observations and recommendations were discussed with concerned officials of the SSC during the exit conference held for the purpose last April 28, 2021. Management comments and reactions were considered in the report, where it is deemed appropriate.
