C. Scope and Objectives of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial accounts and operations of the PSRTI for the year 

ended December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of 

assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements 

(FSs); (b) determine the propriety of transactions, as well as the extent of compliance 

with pertinent laws, rules and regulations;  (c) recommend agency’s improvement 



   

iii 

opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit 

recommendations. 

 

D. Audit Methodology 
 

We adopted a risk-based audit approach in the audit of the FSs of the PSRTI and in 

the review of compliance with laws, rules and regulations.  The Audit Team carried 

out the audit and conducted, among others the following : (i) examined financial and 

accounting procedures adopted and other relevant documentation; (ii) assessed 

internal controls regulating financial operations  and carried out compliance testing for 

determining the extent of control in operation; (iii)  conducted substantive testing of a 

representative sample of selected transactions;  (iv) carried out review, on test check 

basis, of a number of contracts and transactions related to movements in balances of 

assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses; and (v) conducted interviews and held 

discussions with the concerned officials and staff of PSRTI.  

 

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and the 

concerned officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda.  

 
E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 

 

The auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the 

PSRTI’s FSs as at December 31, 2020 due to  the material accounting errors that 

affected the balances of the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current and Savings 

Account, Investments in Treasury  Bonds- Local, Interest Income, Rent/Lease Income, 
Other Service Income, Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) and other related accounts, as 

discussed in Part I - Independent Auditor’s Report and in Part II - Observations and 

Recommendations of this report. 

 

  

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

Among, the audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in 

detail in Part II of this report, the significant observations are summarized as follows: 

 

1. Various accounting errors and omissions in the keeping the accounts resulted in 
the misstatements in some assets, liabilities and equity accounts. 

 
a. Erroneous recognition of net proceeds from sale of bid documents and receipts 

of other income of P3,228.50, and P0.951 million, respectively 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct/direct the Accountant

thereafter; and (b) recognize the remittance of net proceeds from sales of bid 

documents to the BTr under Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular and

identify the payments pertaining to cancelled trainings within the year for 

adjustment of corresponding payments for seminar/training fees; and (b) 

recognize the unearned revenue as at year-end under Other Deferred Credits.

recognize HTM investments at their fair value and transaction costs at initial 

recognition; and (b)  determine the carrying value at the end of CY 2020 and 

every  year-end thereafter as basis for the subsequent year’s amortization of  

total investments; and (c) amortize the carrying value of HTM investment a 

using the effective interest method.  
 

e. Non-recognition of the maturity proceeds and non-derecognition of matured 
HTM investment P20.824 million and P20.346 million, respectively

v 

 

 

g. Erroneous recognition of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) donated .to 
various government agencies - P312,251.89 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant to 

recognize the disposal of PPE under the appropriate accounts considering 

the mode of disposal and not directly against Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit). 

 

h. Undelivered PPE recognized as payables - P226,396.67 
 

We recommended that Management direct the Budget Officer to prepare the 

Obligation Request and Status setting up obligations when there is a valid 

claim as evidenced by documents properly signed and approved.  We also 

recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 

recognize PPE only when delivered, accepted and available for use.  

 

2. The completeness and accuracy of the balances of several asset and expense 
accounts were not determined due to deficiencies in the reporting of loss of PPE, 

deposits and remittances of income, and  the issuance and safekeeping of billings. 

 

a. Unreported and unrecognized loss of 13 tablets with a carrying value of 

P143,081.66 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant to 

derecognize the 13 lost Tablets and recognize receivable from the Chief, 

Research Division and Supervisor at the depreciated replacement cost, unless 

another person was determined to be responsible for the loss.

interest income on bank accounts, as applicable, are processed for remittance 

to the BTr; and (c) recognize remittances of excess training fees and interest 

income in the books of accounts.  We also recommended and Management 

agreed to require the Cashier to remit immediately to the BTr the excess 

training fees and interest income of P1.035 million as at year-end and 

thereafter.

P361,840.00 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant to issue 

the BC only to participants or agencies whose participants had already 

attended the seminars/trainings and to support the same in the recognition 

of receivables and income in the books. 

 

e. Deficiencies in the preparation and safekeeping of BCs 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the:   

 

a) Chief, TD to:  (i) prepare the BCs for seminars/trainings conducted and 
rental of training facilities and forward the same to the Accountant for 

the indication of the serial number and the Accountant’s signature; and

and furnish the TD and Cashier a copy of the BCs for reference and 

monitoring purposes; and (ii) maintain copies of the BCs for reference 

and as supporting documents in the recognition of receivables and 

income. 

 

3. Deficiencies in the preparation and maintenance of registries, Financial 
Accountability Reports (FARs) and budgetary forms, and in the realignment of 

allotments resulted in unreliable budgetary and financial records and reports.  

 

a. Non-maintenance of the Registries of Allotments, Obligations and 
Disbursements (RAOD) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Budget Officer to 

maintain the prescribed RAODs by allotment class to support the 

information in the related FARs and FSs and facilitate verification and 

analysis thereof. 



   

vii 

 

b. Erroneous and non-inclusion of General Allotment Release Order (GARO)/ 
Special Allotment Release Orders (SAROs) and discrepancies noted in FAR 

Nos. 1 and 1-A

review the information contained in FAR Nos. 1 and 1-A under the 

Appropriation and Allotment columns and reconcile the noted differences to 

reflect the correct amounts in the FARs.

Nos. 1, 1-A and 4. 

 

e. Discrepancies in the reported unpaid obligations in FAR Nos. 1, 1-A, 3 and 
Accounts Payables 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Budget Officer 

and Accountant to review and reconcile the varying reported unpaid 

obligations in FAR Nos. 1, 1-A and 3, and the balance reported in the 

Accounts Payable.  

 

4. Non-preparation of the Order of Payment (OP resulted in errors in the 
identification of the fund to which collections relate and in the issuance of the 

Official Receipts thereon. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed that the Accountant prepare the 

OP to be issued to the payor based on the BC, indicating in both documents 

the fund cluster to which any collection pertains.  We also recommend that 

Management require the Cashier to ensure that payment is not received in 

the absence of the OP. 

 

The above mentioned observations and the corresponding  recommendations were 



   

viii 

communicated to the Head of the Agency and the concerned officials through the 

issuance of the Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations (SAOR) for  

their further comments in lieu of an exit conference.  Management’s views and 

comments were received on April 22, 2021, and its views and comments were

recommendations to improve the financial and operational efficiency of the 

agency.
