OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
  

Financial Audit 

 

Accounting Errors 

 

1. Various accounting errors in the keeping the accounts resulted in the 
misstatements in some assets, liabilities and equity accounts. 

 

Paragraph 29(b), IPSAS 1 provides that a fair presentation requires an entity to 

present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, 

reliable, comparable, and understandable information.  Reliable information is defined 

under Section 6(e), Chapter 19, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual 

(GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) as free from material error and 

bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to 

represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. 

  

Review and verification of the accounts and transactions of the Philippine 

Statistical Research and Training Institute (PSRTI) disclosed accounting errors that had 

affected the reliability and fair presentation of the account balances reported at year-

end, as summarized in Table 1.

Section 8(a), Chapter 10, 

Volume I of GAM for

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant to 

analyze the related transactions and prepare the necessary adjusting entries to 

correct the aforementioned errors; and henceforth, observe the proper/correct 

recording of accounts and transactions in accordance with GAM for NGAs and 

other applicable rules and regulations. 

 

a. Erroneous recognition of net proceeds from sale of bid documents and receipts of 
other income of P3,228.50, and P0.951 million, respectively 

 

In CY 2020, the PSRTI collected proceeds from sales of bid documents 

totaling P13,000.00 which were recognized under Cash in Bank-Local Currency, 

Current Account and Other Business Income of the Internally Generated Fund 

(IGF). The proceeds from sales of bid documents which are intended to be used for 

the payment of honoraria and overtime pay of the Chair and members of the Bids 

and Awards Committee (BAC) and Technical Working Group (TWG) and other 

related expenses of the BAC are considered trust receipts to be recorded under Trust 

Liabilities. The total proceeds are to be remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) 

with a corresponding debit under Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust. For any 

payment of honoraria, overtime pay or BAC-related expenses, the agency will have 

to request the Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) from the Department of Budget 

and Management (DBM).  

 

It was noted, however, that the PSRTI recognized the receipts of the said 

proceeds under the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account and were not  

recognized under the Trust Liabilities.  The proceeds were, likewise, not remitted 

to the BTr, thus, were not recognized under Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust.  



   

29 
 

 

From this amount, P9,771.50 was disbursed for the meal expenses of the 

chair and members of the BAC and TWG that were recognized under the Other 

Maintenance and Operating Expenses resulting in a net sales proceeds of P3,228.50 

which remained under Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account of the IGF 

as at year-end and were not remitted to the General Fund of the BTr, thus, were not 

recognized under Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular. At year-end, the Cash-

Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular is credited to close the said account to the 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit). 

 

Further, receipts of payments for the use of training facilities of the PSRTI 

totaling P0.951 million were recognized under Other Service Income and 

Seminar/Training Fees in the amounts of P0.911 million and P40,000.00, 

respectively, or a total of P0.951 million, instead of Rent/Lease Income, which is 

the appropriate account to recognize income from use of government 

properties/facilities.   

  

The erroneous recognition of the proceeds from sales of bid documents and 

income from the use of facilities overstated the Cash in Bank, Local Currency, 

Current Account, Other Service Income, Seminar/Training Fees, Other Business 

Income, Other Maintenance and Operating Expenses and Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) by P3,228.50, P907.6 million, P40,000.00 P13,000.00, P9,771.50, 

and P3,228.50 and understated the Rent/Lease Income by P0.951 million. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct/direct the  

Accountant to: (a) process the remittance to the BTr of the net proceeds of 

P3,228.50 from the sales of bid documents and similar balances thereafter; and 

(b) recognize the remittance of net proceeds from sales of bid documents to the 

BTr under Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular and Other Service Income. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the Cashier 

to remit to the BTr the net proceeds from the sales of bid documents. 

 

b. Non-recognition of billed training fees - P72,000.00 
 

Review of copies of the Bill of Collection (BC) for unpaid training fees 

showed that Bill No. 2020-29 dated November 11, 2020 in the name of the 

Department of Environment and Natural Resources for P72,000.00, representing 

unpaid training fees for the 12 participants on the Statistics for Policy Analysis 

training course, was not recognized in the books of accounts as at year-end. 

 

Under the accrual basis of accounting, transactions and other events are to 

be recognized in the books when they occur and not only when cash or its 

equivalent is received or paid. However, unpaid training fees of P72,000.00 as 

supported by the issued BC have not been recognized as receivable in the books, 

representing income already earned but for which payment is yet to be received. 



   

30 
 

The non-recognition of the receivables resulted in the understatement of Due from 

National Government Agencies and Seminar/Training Fees and Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) of the IGF, all in the amount of P72,000.00. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant to 

recognize the receivables for the unpaid training fees billed in the amount of 

P72,000.00 under Due from National Government Agencies, and similar 

receivables from training fees under the appropriate receivable accounts. 
 

c. Non-adjustment of fees collected from cancelled trainings to liability account - 
P343,152.00 

 

Under the published citizen’s charter of the agency, for a participant to 

reserve a slot in a particular training course, the applicable training fee must be paid 

seven days before the training date. It was observed that the agency, upon receipt 

of the payment, recognizes the payment as income even if the training course is yet 

to be conducted.  

 

For CY 2020, the PSRTI had initially scheduled 50 regular training courses. 

However, due to the Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19 pandemic, only 20 regular 

training courses were conducted. Verification of the Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) 

and their supporting documents on the recognition of the receipts of payments of 

seminar/training fees totaling P343,152.00 showed that payments for training 

courses that were not conducted were recognized under Seminar/Training Fees.   

 

Although cash payments for training fees were already received for the 

cancelled trainings, revenue had not yet been earned. As the recognition of revenue 

should be deferred until earned, the amount of P343,152.00 taken up under 

Seminar/Training Fees should have been adjusted to Other Deferred Credits at 

year-end. 

 

The non-adjustment of payments received for trainings which had been 

cancelled understated Other Deferred Credits by P343,152.00 and overstated 

Seminar/Training Fees and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) by the same amount. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant 

to: (a) identify the payments pertaining to cancelled trainings within the year 

for adjustment of corresponding payments for seminar/training fees; and (b) 

recognize the unearned revenue as at year-end under Other Deferred Credits. 

 

d. Erroneous recognition of initial measurement and non-amortization of HTM 
investments 

 

The PSRTI has an existing Endowment Fund of P134.000 million which is 

invested in Treasury Bonds (TBonds) for the purpose of earning interests that can 

be used to augment the agency’s operational expenses. 



   

31 
 

Analysis of Investments in Treasury Bonds-Local revealed that the account 

consists of placements in five to 10 year-term bonds issued by the BTr thru the 

Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) 

and Philippine Veterans Bank (PVB). These TBonds are issued by the BTr through 

financial institutions, such as the LBP, among others, which are designated by the 

BTr as authorized government securities eligible dealers (GSEDs). For the PSRTI 

to be able to purchase TBonds from these GSEDs, the agency opened savings 

accounts with these GSEDs from which the cost of investments and the maturity 

proceeds are automatically withdrawn/debited and deposited/credited, respectively. 

 

As the initial measurement is the basis for the amortization of investment 

every interest payment until maturity date, any error in the recognition of the initial 

measurement will consequently result in the erroneous subsequent amortizations 

and carrying values.   

 

Further analysis of the Investments in Treasury Bonds-Local showed that 

the initial measurement of five out of the seven HTM investments were erroneously 

recognized as equal to the total cash out but rounded off to the nearest million 

and/or at face value, instead of recognizing these investments at fair value plus 

transaction costs, such as broker’s commissions, mapping and matching fees, 

among others, or the total actual cash out. Thus, the initial measurement was 

overstated by a net amount of P166,585.53. Details are presented in Table 2.

Total  P134,000,000.00 P133,833,414.47 P166,585.53 

 

The investments in TBonds are amortized using the effective interest 

method which is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset and 

of allocating the interest revenue over the relevant period or term of the investment 

so that at maturity, the carrying value of the investment will be equal to its face 

value.   

 

However, it was observed that the above investments in TBonds were not 

amortized when interest payments were received. The non-amortization of the 

investment in TBonds is evidenced by the same total beginning and ending balances 

of P134.000 million in the agency’s General Ledger (GL) for Investments in 

Treasury Bonds-Local. The ending balance of P134.000 million included 

investment in TBonds which had already matured on December 16, 2020 as 

discussed in Observation 1.e. below. The non-amortization of the investment in 



   

32 
 

TBonds showed a net understatement of P251,138.50 between the reported balance 

of the Investments in Treasury Bonds-Local, excluding the amount of investment 

that had matured, and the audited carrying amount of investments at year-end of 

P114 million, and P114.251 million, respectively. 

 

Accordingly, the erroneous recognition of initial measurement of the 

investment in TBonds and the subsequent non-amortization thereof resulted in a net 

understatement of Investments in Treasury Bonds-Local and Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) by P251,138.50 at year-end. 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant 

to: (a) recognize HTM investments at their fair value and transaction costs at 

initial recognition; and (b) determine the carrying value at the end of CY 2020 

and every year-end thereafter as basis for the subsequent year’s amortization 

of total investments; and (c) amortize the carrying value of HTM investment 

a using the effective interest method.  
 

e. Non-recognition of the maturity proceeds and non-derecognition of matured HTM 
investment P20.824 million and P20.346 million, respectively 

 

Review of the maturity dates of investments in TBonds revealed that the 

bond placement with the PVB with identification number of PIBD0716A488 had 

already matured on December 16, 2020.  It has a face value of P20.346 million 

which was initially recognized in the books in the amount of P20.000 million 

instead of P19.861 million. The same initial measurement of P20.000 million was 

also reported as its balance under Investments in Treasury Bonds-Local at year-end. 

Verification of the receipt of the proceeds of the maturity of the TBond revealed 

that a total amount of P20.824 million was already deposited to the savings account 

with PVB on December 16, 2020, representing the last interest payment of 

P478,120.19, net of taxes withheld of P119,530.05, plus the face value of the 

TBonds of P20.346 million. However, the investment was still carried in the books 

and included in the reported account balance of Investment in Bonds-Local in spite 

of the receipt of its maturity proceeds. Likewise, the total amount of maturity 

proceeds was not recognized in the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Savings Account 

although it was part of the bank balance. 

 

As the receipt of the total maturity proceeds, including the last interest 

payment, were not recognized in the books, the interest income earned and taxes 

withheld of P0.633 million, and P119,530.05, respectively, from the last interest 

payment were not similarly recognized. Consequently, the non-recognition of the 

maturity proceeds of P20.824 million and non-derecognition of the matured 

investment of P20.346 million overstated the reported balance of Investments in 

Treasury Bonds-Local by P20.000 million, and understated  Cash in Bank-Local 

Currency, Savings Account, Interest Income, Taxes, Duties and Licenses and 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit), by P20.824 million, P0.633 million, P119,530.05 

and P0.824 million, respectively. 



   

33 
 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant 

to (a) recognize proceeds of maturity of HTM investments and derecognize 

HTM investments as maturity proceeds are received; and (b) recognize 

interest income at its gross amount and taxes withheld thereon.  
 

f. Non-accrual and non-recognition of earned interest on investments - P363,250.39 
 

The investments in TBonds are all interest-bearing and are paid interests on 

a quarterly basis. Following the accrual basis of accounting, interests earned from 

the last receipt of interest payment until the end of the accounting period have to be 

accrued and recognized under Interests Receivable. However, verification of copies 

of the Confirmation of Sale from the GSEDs and passbook on accounts with the 

GSEDs revealed that interests earned from the last interest payment until December 

31, 2020 in the amount of P363,250.39 were not accrued and recognized in the 

books.  Details are presented in Table 3.

Total    P363,250.39 

 

The entry to recognize the accrual of interest earned from the last interest 

payment until December 31, 2020 is similar to that of the amortization of 

investment in TBonds at every receipt of interest payment. To recognize the accrual 

of interest earned at year-end on the above investments in TBonds, the Interest 

Receivable, Investments in Treasury Bonds-Local and Taxes, Duties and Licenses 

are debited while Interest Income and Other Payables are credited.  The amount to 

be debited under the Investments in Treasury Bonds-Local is the portion of 

amortization of investment in TBonds to reflect the actual carrying value of these 

investments at year-end. In Table 3, the last interest payments were before year-

end, hence, the value of the investments in TBonds on the last interest payment 

does not reflect the carrying value as at December 31, 2020. 

 

The non-accrual of interest income earned from the last interest payment up 

to the end of the year resulted in the understatement of Investments in Treasury 

Bonds-Local, Interest Receivable, Other Payables, Interest Income, Taxes, Duties 

and Licenses and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) by P6,958.97, P357,639.68, 

P71,527.93, P364,598.65, P71,527.93 and  P293,070.72, respectively. 

 



   

34 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant 

to: (a) recognize accrual of interests on investment in TBonds at year-end, as 

applicable; (b) amortize the value of TBonds from the last interest payment to 

the end of the year and recognize the amortization. 

 

g. Erroneous recognition of PPE donated to various government agencies - 
P312,251.89 

 

For CY 2020, the PSRTI disposed through donation various obsolete and 

no longer needed property, plant and equipment (PPE) that can still be used by other 

government agencies, with a carrying value of P312,251.89. However, review of 

the books of accounts showed that the carrying value of the donated assets were 

recognized with a debit to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit)  and credits to the 

corresponding PPE accounts  instead of recognizing an expense under Donations, 

thereby understating Donations by P312,251.89 and overstating the Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) for the period by the same amount. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant 

to recognize the disposal of PPE under the appropriate accounts considering 

the mode of disposal and not directly against Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit). 

 

h. Undelivered PPE recognized as payables - P226,396.67 
 

Analysis of the account balances of all PPE accounts in the GL, PPE Ledger 

Cards (PPELCs) and the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and 

Equipment (RPCPPE) disclosed that the Information and Communication 

Technology (ICT) Equipment balances per GL against the PPELCs and RPCPPE of 

P22.508 million and  P22.281 million, respectively, had a discrepancy of 

P226,396.67. 

 

Continuous reconciliation was made by the Accounting and Property Units 

to identify the causes of the discrepancies between their records. Majority of the 

differences were already reconciled, except for the P226,396.67.   
 

Further analysis of the discrepancy showed that ICT equipment totaling 

P226,396.67 were recognized under Information and Communication Technology 

Equipment and Accounts Payable as evidenced by Journal Entry Voucher No. 01-

2020-12-083 dated December 31, 2020, drawn to set-up a payable to the suppliers 

for the purchase of the ICT equipment. Details are presented in Table 4.

The POs for the equipment, both dated December 28, 2020, were signed by 

the suppliers in the Conforme portion only on January 13 and 14, 2021, however, 

the ORS to obligate the payable to the suppliers was dated December 29, 2020.  

Also, the Inspection and Acceptance Report Nos. 2021-01-008 and 2021-010 

showed that the equipment were only delivered and received by the PSRTI on 

January 21, 2021.  Clearly, there was no obligation to the suppliers at year-end since 

there was no delivery and acceptance of the equipment.  

 

According to the Accountant, the JEV setting-up the liability for the purpose 

of the equipment was drawn at year-end to ensure that there is funding for both 

POs. 

  

The recognition of undelivered ICT Equipment as at year-end resulted in 

the overstatement of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) 

Equipment and  Accounts Payable, both by P226,396.67. 

 

We recommended that Management direct the Budget Officer to 

prepare the ORS setting up obligations when there is a valid claim as 

evidenced by documents properly signed and approved. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the 

Accountant to recognize PPE only when delivered, accepted and available for 

use. 

 

 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

2. The completeness and accuracy of the balances of several asset and expense 
accounts were not determined due to deficiencies in the reporting of loss of PPE, 

deposit and remittance of income, and issuance and safekeeping of billings. 
 

For CY 2020, some deficiencies in the reporting of loss of PPE, deposit and 

remittance of income, and issuance and safekeeping of billings were noted, as 

summarized in Table 5.

a. Unreported and unrecognized loss of 13 tablets with a carrying value of 

P143,081.66 

 

Section 73 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 states that when a loss of 

government funds or property occurs while they are in transit or the loss is caused 

by fire, theft, or other casualty or force majeure, the officer accountable therefore or 

having custody thereof shall immediately notify the Commission or the auditor 

concerned and, within thirty days or such longer period as the Commission or auditor 

may in the particular case allow, shall present his application for relief, with the 

available supporting evidence. Whenever warranted by the evidence, credit for the 

loss shall be allowed. An officer who fails to comply with this requirement shall not 

be relieved of liability or allowed credit for any loss in the settlement of his accounts.  
 

In addition, Section 41, Chapter 10, Volume I of GAM for NGAs provides, 

among others, the following accounting policies on loss of property: 

 

a) Lost property and the related accumulated depreciation and impairment 
loss shall be derecognized in the books upon receipt of the Report of 

Lost, Stolen, Damaged, Destroyed Property (RLSDDP) supported by a 

Notice of Loss prepared and submitted by the Accountable Officer.  The 

loss shall be charged to account “Loss of Assets” at an amount equal to 

its carrying amount. 

 



   

37 
 

b) The accountability of the accountable officer over the loss of 
depreciable asset shall be based on depreciated replacement cost (DRC). 

DRC is replacement cost less accumulated depreciation calculated on 

the basis of replacement cost. 

 

c) A receivable account shall be set up to record the accountability of the 
accountable officer simultaneous with derecognition of the lost PPE. 

 

The Property Officer who was due to retire in April 2021 conducted the 

annual physical count of PPE on January 23, 2021 for the transfer of accountability 

to the incoming Property Officer.  Verification of the RPCPPE disclosed that 15 

out of the 300 tablets reported were found to be missing during the physical count. 

Further, two tablets out of the 15 units lost were reportedly misplaced and lost by 

the Field Supervisor during the field operations for the National ICT Household 

Survey Project last January 2020. The costs of the two tablets totaling P31,484.00 

were deducted from the final payment of the salary of the said Field Supervisor last 

June 19, 2020. Of the remaining 13 lost tablets, with a total carrying value  (CV) of 

P143,081.66 as at December 31, 2020,  eight and five units  with CV of P88,050.25 

and P55,031.41 were issued to the Chief and the Supervisor of the Research 

Division (RD), respectively, as evidenced by the Property Acknowledgement 

Receipts (PARs). 

 

The Property Officer informed the Chief, RD, who is also one of the 

accountable officers, of the loss of the said tablets. On February 25, 2021, the 

Management created a Committee to investigate the matter. The Report of the 

Special Investigation Committee, supported by other documents concerning the lost 

tablets were submitted to the Audit Team on May 20, 2021, which concludes that 

the Committee was unable to determine the possible person/s responsible for the 

loss of the tablets. Management is yet to decide whether to charge the lost tablets 

against the accountable officers or to hold the security agency liable for any losses 

or damages to the property of the PSRTI as agreed in the PSRTI’s contract with the 

said agency. 

 

 Further, the duly accomplished RLSDDP together with the Incident Report, 

were only accomplished on April 14, 2021 and provided to the Audit Team on April 

21, 2021.  

 

 Since the Special Investigation Committee for the lost PPE was formed only 

on February 25, 2021 and the RLSDDP was prepared in CY 2021, the recognition 

of the lost PPE and the receivables from the person/s responsible/accountable were 

not yet taken up in the books in CY 2020 affecting the accuracy of the balance of 

the Information and Communication Technology Equipment, Loss of Assets, Due 

from Officers and Employees and Other Deferred Credits. Also, the Committee was 

not able to determine the person/s responsible for the loss. As such, the 

accountability remains with the Chief, RD, unless otherwise another person will be 

proven to be responsible for the loss. 



   

38 
 

 We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant to 

derecognize the 13 lost tablets and recognize receivable from the Chief, RD 

and Supervisor at the depreciated replacement cost, unless another person was 

determined to be responsible for the loss. 

 

b. Income erroneously deposited in a special account with the BTr - P12.084 million 
 

As at December 31, 2020, the Endowment Fund (EF) has a balance of 

P134.000 million. The interest income earned on investments from the Fund are 

deposited in a special account with the BTr and can be used to augment operational 

expenses subject to the release of a Notice of Cash Allocation by the DBM.  

 

 Management fees of P11.010 million and administrative fees of P1.074 

million or a total of P12.084 million from CYs 2018 to 2020, earned by the PSRTI 

in the conduct of customized trainings and researches were remitted to the BTr and 

recognized under account Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account.  As at 

December 31, 2020, the account has a balance of P24.044 million, inclusive of 

management and administrative fees from CY 2017 and earlier. 

 

 The management and administrative fees totaling P12.084 million earned 

were deposited with the BTr as a special account although there was no authority 

to set aside such income for a specific purpose for subsequent release to the agency.  

While the said fees are other income accruing from the operations of the PSTRI, 

the same were not deposited to the bank account/s to form part of the EF which is 

being invested in long-term TBonds by the PSRTI.   

 

The erroneous deposit of the management and administrative fees in a 

special account with the BTr instead of the EF affected the completeness and/or  

accuracy of the balances of Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Savings Account  and 

Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Special Account.  Moreover, interest which may 

have accrued from investments from the EF have not been realized and made 

available to augment the PSRTI’s operational expenses.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant 

to: (a) identify management and administrative fees deposited to the special 

account with the BTr; (b) coordinate with the BTr and the DBM on the 

possible withdrawal of the management and administrative fees erroneously 

deposited to a special account with the BTr for transfer to the EF; and (c) take 

appropriate action based on the advice of the BTr and the DBM. 

 

c. Unremitted excess training fees and interest income to the BTr - P1.035 million 
 

As discussed earlier, the PSRTI’s Regular Training Courses Calendar for 

CY 2020 showed 50 regular training courses scheduled from April to October 2020, 

however, due to the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the PSRTI was able 

to conduct only 20 regular training courses. 



   

39 
 

Analysis of Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account and 

Seminar/Training Fees and examination of relevant documents showed that for the 

20 regular training courses, the PSRTI had collected P1.150 million, while 

disbursements for related seminar expenses totaled P0.771 million, leaving a 

balance of P378,498.08. Also, there were payments received in CY 2020 totaling 

P1.373 million for training courses conducted in CY 2019 with related 

disbursements of P0.717 million, or a balance of P0.656 million. However, the total 

excess training fees of P378,498.08 and P0.656 million, or a total of P1.035 million 

were retained under the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account and were 

not remitted to the BTr as at December 31, 2020. 

 

Moreover, interest income of P381.18 on deposits with the LBP recognized 

under Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account also remained unremitted to 

the BTr as at year-end. 

 

The total amount P1.035 million from excess training fees and interest 

income continued to be carried in the books of the PSRTI although it had no right 

over the same, thus, affecting the accuracy of the balance Cash in Bank-Local 

Currency, Current Account and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit). 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant to 

(a) process the remittance to the BTr of the excess training fees and interest 

income totaling P1.035 million; and (b) ensure that excess training fees and 

interest income on bank accounts, as applicable, are processed for remittance 

to the BTr; and (c) recognize remittances of excess training fees and interest 

income in the books of accounts. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the Cashier 

to remit immediately to the BTr the excess training fees and interest income of 

P1.035 million as at year-end and thereafter. 
 

d. Issuance of  BCs for seminars/trainings not yet conducted - P361,840.00 
 

The Bill of Collection (BC) is normally prepared and issued by the PSRTI 

to demand payment of fees from participants who have not yet paid the 

corresponding fees for the trainings attended or in instances of overpayment of 

services rendered by contractors or employees, among others. Further, the BCs are 

the bases for recognizing receivables in the books, indicating that services had been 

rendered but payments have not yet been collected or received. 

 

Review of the BCs revealed that there were a number of BCs for a total of 

P361,840.00 issued to training participants for which participants are yet to attend 

the trainings as shown in Table 6.

Inquiry with the Accountant and Chief, Training Division (TD) disclosed 

that the issuance of BCs to participants who are yet to attend the trainings are results 

of the requests of government agencies or private entities for the issuance of BCs 

for the processing of payments for the training. While the PSRTI issues invitation 

for trainings to be conducted, these agencies or entities still request for billings 

instead. 

 

The purpose of BC is to remind the participants on the payment of the fees 

for seminars/trainings attended and serves as supporting document for the 

recognition of receivables from the participants. Thus, the issuance of the BC prior 

to the conduct of the seminars/trainings can create confusion as to whether there 

exists an amount due to the PSRTI from the participants, affecting the recognition 

of income under Seminar/Training Fees and the appropriate inter-agency and other 

receivables  in the books. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Accountant to 

issue the BC only to participants or agencies whose participants had already 

attended the seminars/trainings and to support the same in the recognition of 

receivables and income in the books.

e. Deficiencies in the preparation and safekeeping of BCs 
 

Further review of the BCs issued revealed instances of duplication in the 

serial numbers. These duplicate BCs were issued to different persons/entities and/or 

used to bill two different seminars/trainings, as shown in Table 7.

According to the Accountant, the noted duplication in the BC can be 

attributed to its preparation by different personnel in the divisions and that the serial 

numbers of the BCs are not pre-numbered but are encoded only. There is no existing 

control in the numbering of the BCs. The BCs for the payment of the fees for 

seminars/trainings and rental of training facility are prepared by the Training 

Division (TD) while those relating to the overpayment of salaries or services 

rendered are prepared by the Finance and Accounting Division (FAD).  

 

Inquiry with the Chief, TD disclosed that the BC is prepared in three copies 

by the TD or FAD and sent to the Accountant for signature. The three signed copies 

of the BC are distributed as follows: one copy for the division from where it 

originated, one copy for the Accountant, and one copy is furnished to the agency or 

individual who attended the seminar/training.   

 

Aside from the duplication in the series numbers on the BCs, further 

examination of BCs also revealed that the fund cluster was not indicated in the 

issued BCs. As PSRTI maintains four different funds and that BCs are prepared for 

collection of an unpaid transaction due to a particular fund, the inclusion of the fund 

cluster in the BC will readily identify to what fund the transaction relates and which 

corresponding OR will be issued.   

 

Moreover, further examination of the copies of all BCs issued in CY 2020 

also revealed that these were not properly maintained as evidenced by the four 

missing series of BCs that were not furnished to the Audit Team.  Some copies of 



   

42 
 

the BCs were in the custody of the Cashier and others were yet to be located. The 

Accountant did not, however, retain copies of the BCs although such are evidences 

or supporting documents of receivables due for collection from the attendees to the 

seminars/trainings. 

  

The missing BCs, incidences of duplicate serial numbers and absence of 

fund cluster in the BCs affected the recognition of income under Seminar/Training 

Fees and the appropriate inter-agency and other receivables in the books. 

 

  We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief, TD 

to: (a) prepare the BCs for seminars/trainings conducted and rental of training 

facilities and forward the same to the Accountant for the indication of the 

serial number and the Accountant’s signature; and (b) observe proper 

safekeeping or maintenance of the BCs to preclude their loss and for reference 

in subsequent issuances. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the 

Accountant and personnel of each division involved in the preparation of the 

BC to indicate the fund for which the payment is due for proper identification 

of the fund to which deposit should be made. 

  

We further recommended that Management require the Accountant 

to: (a) indicate in the BCs the serial number, sign the same and furnish the TD 

and Cashier a copy of the BCs for reference and monitoring purposes; and (b) 

maintain copies of the BCs for reference and as supporting documents in the 

recognition of receivables and income. 

 

 

Compliance Issues 

 

3. Deficiencies in the preparation and maintenance of registries, FARs and 
budgetary forms, and in the realignment of allotments resulted in unreliable 

budgetary and financial records and reports.  

 

The following deficiencies were noted in the maintenance of the registries, the 

preparation, maintenance and reconciliation of the Financial Accountability Reports 

(FARs) with the registries, related FARs and Financial Statements (FSs), and 

realignments of allotments arising from the Budget Officer and Accountant’s lack of 

information on the need for the same and of the interdependence of the registries, FARs 

and the related FSs accounts: 

 

a. Non-maintenance of RAODs 
 

Section 1, Chapter 3, Volume I of GAM for NGAs, prescribes the guidelines 

in monitoring, accounting, and reporting of the budget in the FSs. It also prescribes 

the records to be maintained by the NGAs, forms to be used, and reports to be 



   

43 
 

prepared to effectively monitor the budget, as well as, the required information, 

disclosure, and presentation of budget information in the FSs. Moreover, Section 5 

of same Chapter requires the Budget Division to maintain registries for the purpose 

of monitoring the agency budget. The various registries maintained are the 

supporting details in the preparation of FARs and used as source documents to 

facilitate verification thereof, and related FSs. 

 

Verification of the maintenance of the Registries of Allotments, Obligations 

and Disbursements  (RAODs) by the Budget Officer revealed that the Journal of 

Allotments and Obligations (JAO) for the current appropriations is being 

maintained instead of the prescribed RAODs for both current and continuing 

appropriations.  The JAO does not provide information on the disbursements paid 

out of obligations incurred and therefore, the unpaid obligations cannot be readily 

identified, unlike in the RAODs.  

 

Since the RAODs are source documents in the preparation of FARs and in 

the validation of the Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts 

(SCBAA) and the Statement of Cash Flows (SCF), the absence of complete 

supporting information affected the reported disbursements and unpaid obligations 

in the FARs and FSs and did not facilitate the complete verification of the accuracy 

and reliability of information in the FARs and FSs.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Budget 

Officer to maintain the prescribed RAODs by allotment class to support the 

information in the related FARs and FSs and facilitate verification and 

analysis thereof. 

 

b. Erroneous and non-inclusion of General Allotment Release Order (GARO)/Special 
Allotment Release Orders (SAROs) and discrepancies noted in FAR Nos. 1 and 1-

A 

 

The Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs) were required 

in compliance with the pertinent Sections of the General Provisions (GP) of the 

annual General Appropriations Act (GAA). Relative to this, various circulars were 

issued prescribing the BFAR forms and corresponding submission timelines, 

including the encoding at the DBM Unified Reporting System (URS). The agency’s 

BFARs serve as bases for oversight agencies in their review, monitoring and 

evaluation of agency’s utilization of funds versus its plans/targets, among others. 

The source documents for the information contained in the agency’s BFARs are the 

registries, and information contained in one accountability report can likewise be 

reconciled with another accountability report and the related FSs. 

 

Review of the Statement of Appropriation, Allotments, Obligations, 

Disbursement and Balances by Object of Expenditures (SAAODBOE) or FAR No. 

1-A of the PRSTI revealed discrepancies in appropriations and allotments as 

reported and as audited. Details are presented in Tables 8 and 9.

As at year-end, the discrepancies in the Adjustments column under 

Appropriation and Allotments Received and Adjustments columns under 

Allotments have not been identified and reconciled by the Budget Officer. On the 

Transfer to and Transfer From columns under the Allotments of the FAR Nos. 1 

and 1-A, the amounts to be presented here are sourced from the List of Allotment 

and Sub-Allotments or FAR 1-B. On the Transfer To column, any amount reported 

herein should reconcile with the amount presented in Item A - Allotments received 

from DBM under Sub-Allotments to ROs/OUs columns 11 to 15. On the other 

hand, the amount under Transfer From column should reconcile with Item B - Sub-

allotments received from CO/RO under columns 6 to 10. Review of the agency’s 

FAR No. 1-B also showed that there was no amount presented either in the Item A 

- Sub-Allotments to ROs/OUs columns 11 to 15 or Item B - Sub-allotments 

received from CO/RO columns 6 to 10 to which the amount of P5.331 million 

should reconcile as bases for the allotment transferred to and from in the FAR Nos. 

1 and 1-A. 

 

The erroneous inclusion and non-inclusion of the GARO and SAROs in the 

FAR No. 1-A did not provide reliable information on the agency’s appropriations 

and allotments received for the year. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Budget 

Officer to review the information contained in FAR Nos. 1 and 1-A under the 

Appropriation and Allotment columns and reconcile the noted differences to 

reflect the correct amounts in the FARs. 
 

c. Non-inclusion of realignments in FAR No. 1-A and deficiencies in realignments of 
allotments 

 

Section 5.2 of NBC No. 578 dated January 6, 2020 requires that 

modifications of allotments shall be subject to the following: (a) accomplishment 

of modification Advice Form duly signed by the approving authority; and (b) 

reflected in the appropriate Registry of Allotment and Obligations; and (c) reported 

in the accountability reports. 

 

Likewise, Section 3.9.3 of the same NBC provides that where insufficiency 

of allotments for Personnel Services (PS) occurs, unobligated PS allotments which 

have been comprehensively released may be utilized subject to the approval of 

Agency head based on: (a) Advise for Use of PS Allotment (APSA); and (b) 

Registry of Allotment and Obligations for PS reflecting said adjustments and 

reported in the accountability reports. 

 

Moreover, Section 3.9.2.1 also provides that the released RLIP allotments 

cannot be reallocated to other objects of expenditures under PS. 

 

Review of the copies of the Modification Advice Forms (MAF) for the 

regular agency budget and the effects of realigned amounts in FAR No. 1-A showed 



   

47 
 

that the realigned amounts were not included in the Adjustments - Allotments 

column of FAR No. 1-A. 

 

Aside from the non-reporting of the realignments in FAR No. 1-A, the Audit 

Team also noted the inappropriate use of objects of expenditures “Dissemination 

Activities (Support to 21st Faculty-Student Conference and Philippine Statistical 

Association Inc. (PSAI) Conference)”, “PHIC” and “Highly Technical 

Consultant” instead of “Membership Dues and Contributions to Organizations”, 

“PhilHealth Contributions”, and “Consultancy Services”, respectively. 

 

Also, review of the MAFs submitted showed that there were realignments 

of PS’s objects of expenditures, such as Salaries and Wages, Uniform and Clothing 

Allowance and Year-end Bonus, among others, totaling P0.871 million supported 

by the MAFs instead of the APSA. 

 

 While the available PS appropriations are allowed to be used to cover PS 

deficiencies, RLIP allotments are one of the items for which released PS allotments 

cannot be reallocated to other expenditures under PS. However, MAF No. 2020-

12-010 dated December 28, 2020 included the RLIP as one of the source items of 

realignment to various PS deficient objects of expenditures which included 

Overtime Pay, Step Increment-Length of Service, and Mid-year Bonus, among 

others, for P27,342.32. Further, MAF Nos. 2020-12-011 and 012, both dated 

December 28, 2020, with amounts of P14,960.04 and P12,381.96, respectively, or 

a total of P27,342.32 were realigned from Year-end Bonus, Step Increment-Length 

of Service and Salaries and Wages-Regular, among other objects of expenditures, 

back to RLIP.  

 

Consequently, the non-inclusion of realignments in FAR No. 1-A, 

inappropriate use of MAF and objects of expenditures and the non-observance on 

the limitations for the use of RLIP did not provide  accurate information on the 

agency’s allotments for the budget’s line items that are still available for 

obligations, among others. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Budget 

Officer to: (a) ensure that realignments are reflected under the Adjustments 

column for Allotment in FAR No. 1-A; (b) ensure that realignments relating 

to PS are supported by the APSA; (c) observe the proper use of the objects of 

expenditures in the realignments of allotments; and (d) observe the prohibition 

on the realignment of RLIP. 

 

d. Discrepancies in the reported disbursements in FAR Nos. 1, 1-A and 4 
 

Under Section 10 and 16, Chapter 3, Volume I of GAM, the disbursements 

reported in FAR No. 1 and 1-A are sourced from the Registries of Allotments, 

Obligations and Disbursements (RAODs) maintained by the agency based on the 

Reports of Checks Issued (RCI)/Report of ADA Issued (RADAI)/Tax Remittance 



   

48 
 

Advice and Journal Entry Voucher prepared by the agency. Also, the reported 

amount of disbursements should correspond to the disbursements reported in FAR 

No. 4 or the Monthly Report of Disbursements. FAR Nos. 1, 1-A and 4 are certified 

correct by the Accountant for the disbursements reported therein.  

  

Review of disbursements reported in FAR Nos. 1 and 1-A of the Current 

and Continuing Appropriations and FAR No. 4 revealed the varying amounts of 

disbursements per accountability report and per allotment class, as shown in Table 

13.

Total P40,426,062.72 P39,785,934.99  P47,631,517.12 

 

The registry maintained by the agency to support the information in the 

FARs is the Journal and Analysis of Obligations (JAO) instead of the prescribed 

RAODs. The JAO provides only allotments, obligations and unobligated allotments 

in contrast with the RAODs which contain allotments received, obligations 

incurred, disbursements, and balances. The varying amounts of disbursements in 

the FAR Nos. 1, 1-A and 4 is due to the absence of supporting information in JAO 

as bases for reporting disbursements. Accordingly, the unreconciled discrepancies 

in the disbursements affected the reliability of the information and balances in the 

FARs and related FSs. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant 

to review and reconcile the discrepancies in the reported disbursements in 

FAR Nos. 1, 1-A and 4. 

 

e. Discrepancies in the reported unpaid obligations in FAR Nos. 1, 1-A, 3 and 
Accounts Payables 

 

The unpaid obligations in FAR No. 1 are broken down into Due and 

Demandable Obligations and Not Yet Due and Demandable Obligations. The total 

amount for both which are reported in FAR No. 1 should reconcile with the total 

amount of the same in the FAR No. 3.  The Due and Demandable Obligations also 

refer to Accounts Payable which are obligations of national government agencies 

(NGAs), among others, for which goods, services, and projects have been 

delivered, rendered, completed and/or accepted regardless of the year when these 

obligations were incurred (i.e., current year or previous years) and are certified 

correct by the Chief Accountant.  On the other hand, Not Yet Due and Demandable 

Obligations which refer to obligations of NGAs, among others, charged against 

current year and prior years' budget for which goods, services and projects not yet 



   

49 
 

delivered, rendered, completed and/or accepted  and are certified correct by the 

Budget Officer. 

Review of the reported obligations revealed varying amounts under Due and 

Demandable Obligations in FAR Nos. 1, 1-A, and 3, and Accounts Payable, as 

shown in Table 14.

The reported Due and Demandable Obligations in the FAR Nos. 1, 1-A and 

3 should reconcile with the reported liabilities in the Account Payable. On the other 

hand, both the Due and Demandable and Not Yet Due and Demandable Obligations 

in FAR Nos. 1 and 1-A should tally with FAR No. 3.  

 

The absence of the RAODs resulted  in discrepancies in the  unpaid 

obligations noted in the FAR Nos. 1, 1-A, 3 and Accounts Payable, affecting the 

reliability of the amount of unpaid obligations reported in the FARs and liabilities 

presented in the FSs. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Budget 

Officer and Accountant to review and reconcile the varying reported unpaid 

obligations in FAR Nos. 1, 1-A and 3, and the balance reported in the Accounts 

Payable.  

 

 

4. Non-preparation of the OP resulted in errors in the identification of the fund to 
which collections relate and in the issuance of ORs thereon. 

 

Section 40, Chapter 5, Volume I of GAM for NGAs on the Detailed Procedures 

for Collections and Deposits through the Collecting Officer (CO) requires that prior to 

payment by the payor as a result of the issued billing, the Accountant will prepare an 

Order of Payment (OP) and the Cashier, based on the OP will issue an Official Receipt 

(OR) to the payor. The details in the OP include, among others, the fund cluster, the 

bill number and date from the billing issued, the bank account name and number to 

which the payment should be deposited.  

 



   

50 
 

Per agency’s practice, the OP is not being prepared by the Accountant.   Instead 

of the OP, the issued BC is the basis of the Cashier for the issuance of OR for the 

payments from the payor. The payor pays directly to the Cashier the amount indicated 

on the BC received. The Cashier, having custody of the issued BCs, verifies the amount 

due and subsequently issues the OR for the payment received.  Both the Accountant 

and the Cashier were not aware that the OP is to be prepared first by the former before 

the Cashier can issue the OR to the payor. 

 

As the PSRTI maintains four different funds, and ORs are maintained for each 

fund, the preparation of the OP prior to payment by the payor will facilitate what 

particular OR will be issued by the Cashier based on the fund indicated in the OP. 

Consequently, with the non-preparation of the OP, errors were made in the 

identification of the fund to which collections relate and in the ORs issued by the 

Cashier. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed that the Accountant prepare 

the OP to be issued to the payor based on the BC, indicating in both documents 

the fund cluster to which any collection pertains. 

 

We also recommend that Management require the Cashier to ensure that 

payment is not received in the absence of the OP. 

 

 

Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts/Other Areas 

 

5. COVID-19-Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 
 

For CY 2020, the PSRTI had not received funds specifically for Coronavirus 

Disease 2019 (COVID-19) response and/or recovery but had utilized its budget for 

related expenses. The COVID-19-related expenses charged to Personnel Services (PS) 

and Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) amounted to P37,000.00 and 

P20,626.86, respectively, or a total of P57,626.86. The results of audit of these COVID-

related transactions are as follows: 
 

On the grant of hazard pay to employees during the ECQ 
 

Section 1 of Administrative Order (AO) No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 of the 

Office of the President authorized the NGAs to grant COVID-19 hazard pay to 

personnel who physically reported for work during the implementation of the Enhanced 

Community Quarantines (ECQs) in their respective work stations, in an amount not 

exceeding P500.00 per day per person. 

   

Analysis of Hazard Pay as at December 31, 2020 disclosed the payments of 

hazard pay at P500.00/day or a total of P23,000.00 and P14,000.00 to eight regular and 

one contractual personnel, respectively, who reported to office during the ECQ (March 

17 to May 15, 2020) and modified ECQ (MECQ) (May 16 to 31, 2020). 

 



   

51 
 

On the provision of supplies/materials for hazard control 

 

Paragraph B, Section VI of AO No. 2020-0015 of the Department of Health 

(DOH) on Risk-based Public Health Standards Across Settings provides that at the 

minimum, all actors shall implement the prescribed interventions in various settings as 

presented under Annex A-Required Public Health Standards Across All Settings as of 

April 27, 2020, depending on their Risk Severity Grading.  For each prescribed 

intervention, concrete examples of corresponding hazard controls (e.g. engineering 

control, administrative control, and personal protective equipment) are provided. 

Column D-Offices/Workplaces of Annex A listed the administrative controls and PPE 

for offices/workplace, such as the provision of tissue, masks, among others.  On the 

other hand, engineering and administrative controls include placement of handwashing 

facilities, hand sanitizers and dispensers with alcohol-based solution in all entrances, 

exits and areas with high foot traffic and facilities. 

 

Review of Other Supplies and Materials Expenses disclosed various 

procurements in the amount of P12,626.86 of surgical masks, face shields, spray 

bottles, disinfectant sprays/solutions, foot bath coil mat, thermogun, inclusive of the 

regular supplies of alcohol in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The supplies, 

except for the thermogun, foot bath coil mat and disinfectant sprays/solutions, were 

given to all PSRTI employees quarterly based on the Reports of Supplies and Materials 

Issued (RSMIs) attached to Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs). 

 

On the provision of Rapid Antigen Test for COVID-19 

  

On the conduct of Senate Budget Hearing in CY 2020, the Senate has required 

all visitors who will be physically attending hearings in the Senate to submit a medical 

certificate or clearance that they are COVID-19 free. Relative to this, Rapid Antigen 

(RT) tests for COVID-19 were performed on two (2) employees of PSRTI at a total 

cost of P8,000.00. 

 

There was no significant observation noted in the audit of the CY 2020 COVID-

19 related expenses as discussed in the foregoing paragraphs. 

 

 

6. Gender and Development (GAD) 
 

Section 31 of the GP of the GAA for FY 2020 provides, among others, the 

formulation of a GAD Plan which shall be integrated in the regular activities of the 

agencies and which shall be funded by at least five per cent of their current year’s 

budget. 

 

A GAD budget of P3.35 million or 5% of their P68.06 million appropriation in 

CY 2020 was allocated for 17 GAD related activities.  However, only 16 planned 

activities had been implemented and one activity was put on hold due to the pandemic.  

There were also noted reductions in the costs of some seminars conducted with the shift 



   

52 
 

to virtual seminars, thus, only P3.14 million was expended of the GAD budget. The 

activities conducted which were mainstreamed in the agency’s regular activities for CY 

2020, among others, were the following: (a) Come up with sex-disaggregated data in 

technical reports; (b) advocate to stakeholders the inclusion of  gender dimension to 

research projects; (c) conduct studies with gender perspective; (d) conduct of statistical 

trainings that incorporate gender issues in examples and lecture modules; (e) come up 

with sex-disaggregated database of training participants; (f) promotion of gender issues 

or advocacies or gender-related activities  through its website; and (g) updating and 

maintenance of GAD Corner in the library. Various GAD activities were also integrated 

in the implementation of the various inter-agency funded trainings and research 

projects for CY 2020.  

 

 

7. Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs) 
 

Section 32 of the GP of the GAA for FY 2020 also requires all agencies of the 

government to formulate plans, programs, and projects intended to address the concerns
