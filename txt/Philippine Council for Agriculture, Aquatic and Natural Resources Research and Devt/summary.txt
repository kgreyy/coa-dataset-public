Sir:

Pursuant to Section 2, Article lX-D of the Philippine Constitution and Section 43 of

Audit Report (AAR) on the accounts and operations of the Philippine Council for
Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCAARRD) for
the year ended December 31 , 2020.

The audit was aimed at verifying the level of assurance that may be placed on
Management's assertions on the financial statements, ascertaining the propriety of
financial transactions and extent of Management's compliance with existing govemment
laws, rules and regulations, recommending a1;ency improvement opportunities and
determining the status of implementation of prior years' audit recommendations.

The audit report was prepared by the Audit Team composed of Ms. Edlyne A. Rosete,
Officer-in-Charge (OlC)-Audit Team Leader, under the supervision of Mr. Juniel D.
Sadiasa, Supervising Auditor. lt consists of the lndependent Auditor's Report, the

The significant observations that need immediate aclion, among others, are as follows:

1. The delayed or non-submission of disburs€ment vouchers, trial balances, financial
statements and supporting schedules precluded the prompt audit of accounts and
financial transactions, early detection and correction of enors/deficiencies and
timely reporting of the audit results to Management, in conlravention with Sec{ion
122(2) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, Section 7.2.1 of the Rules and
Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) as prescribed under Commission
on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2009-006 and Section 60, Chapte|t 9 of the

We expressed a qualified opinion on the fairne,ss of the presentation of the financial
statements in view of the exceptions noted in audit which are stated in the lndependent
Auditor's Report in Part I of this Report.



We recommended that the Executive Director: (a) direct the Accountant to
immediately submit to the Audit Team the lacking disbursement vouchers (DVs)
and their supporting documents, Liquidation Reports (LRs) and Report of
Collections and Deposits (RCDs); and (b) direct the Direclor for Finance and
Administrative Division (FAD) and the Accountant in ensuring that all DVs and
financial reports are submitted to the Audit Team within the prescribed period, to
facilitate timely audit of the accounts and transactions of the PCAARRD, pursuant
to Section 7.2.1 of the RRSA prescribed under COA Circular No. 2009-006 and
Section 60, Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume l. Otherwise, initiate appropriate
action against the concerned personnel in accordance with Section 122(2) of PD
No. 1445, if warranted.

a) variance between book balance and confirmed balances of the implementing
agencies (lAs) amounting to P50, 1 13,362.48;

We recommended that the Executive Director instruct the Accountant to:
(a) verify the noted variance amounting to P50,113,362.48 per confirmation, in
coordination with the assigned Project Manager/Project Leader, and
communicate with the Accountants of the concerned lAs for the immediate
submission of the Financial Reports; (b) reconcile the discrepancy noted as the
result of coordination with the Project Leader and the lAs, make the necessary
adjustments and submit the reconciliation of balances of lhe 42 projects to the
Audit Team for assessment; and (c) work closely with the Project Financial
Management Liquidation Unit to create and maintain a database to facilitate
monitoring and reconciliation of the recorded fund transfers to various lAs.

b) errors in the posting/recording of fund releases and liquidations/refund;

c) outstanding balance of P1.827 billion remained unliquidated despite completion
of the project duration.

We reiterated our audit recommendations that the Executive Director instruct
the Accountant to: (a) revisit all completed projects with outstanding balances,
and coordinate with the Project Managers/Project Leaders and lAs for the
immediate submission of liquidation reports and refund of any unexpended
balances, pursuant to COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 and
Section 3(c and d) of Department of Science and Technology (DOST)
Administrative Order (AO) No. 009, series of 2017, (b) issue "Ceftification by
the Accountant that funds previously transferred to the lmplementing Agency

2. The PCAARRD'S assertions on the validity and reliability of the Due from NGAs,
Local Govemment Units (LGUs), and Non-Govemment Organtzations/People's
Organizations (NGOsiPOs) account balances amounting lo P2,476,9O9,778.19,
P7,1 19,206.00 and P73,165,410.32, respectively, were doubtful due to.

We recommended that the Executive Director instruct the Accountant to
prepare journal entry to reclassify the Municipal Treasurer account to Due from
LGUs account, and to ensure that the Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) and journal
entry vouchers be reviewed thoroughly prior to posting of transactions in the SL
to avoid accumulation of enors in the future transactions.



subsequent releases and consider stopping the processing of DV for fund
transfer involving new projects to the lAs with significant unliquidated balances
for completed projects, pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-002; and (c)
exhaust all legal remedies to compel the concerned lAs and Non-Govemment
OrganizationsiPeople's Organizations (NGOs/POs) to submit liquidation
documents, in accordance with Sections 6.5 and 5.4 of COA Circular Nos. 94-
013 and 2007-001, respectively, particularly for those that have been dormant
for 10 years and above.

3. The Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account balance as of December 31,
2Q2O, of P202,789,O57.98 (gross) is of doubtful validity and reliability due to the
following:

a) there was a difference of P2,641,895.67 between the General Ledger (GL)
balance and the Report on Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment
(RPCPPE);

We recommended that the Executive Director direct: (a) all concerned Divisions
to prepare list of existing PPE per office under their custodies for submission to
and verification of the Property Section prior to the conduct of actual inventory
by the lnventory Committee (lC); (b) the Property Section to update its records
based on the results of the initial inventory, and coordinate with the Accounting
Section to reconcile the Property Cards with the PPE Ledger Cards (PPELCS);
(c) the Accounting Section to take-up necessary journal entries to recognize
PPEs found at station, including the unrecorded Furniture and Fixtures
amounting to P348,893.00, and prepare/maintain the corresponding PPELCS;
(d) the lC to: conduct physical count of all its PPE, whether acquired through
purchase or donation, and prepare and submit the RPCPPE, in compliance
with Section 38, Chapter '10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume l; ensure that full
reconciliation of the inventory count documented in RPCPPE with the records
maintained by Accounting Sec{ion is properly made to establish the conect
balance of PPE, and strictly comply with the guidelines and procedures on
inventory{aking, recognition of those found at station and disposilion for non-
existing/missing PPE items for the one{ime cleansing of PPE accounts of
PCAARRD, in accordance with COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31,
2020; and (e) the Property and Accounting Sections to perform periodic
reconciliation of their records to ensure that all discrepancies are immediately
investigated, cleared and reconciled.

b) absence of lnventory Custodian Slip (lCS) on derecognized PPE items
accounted as semi-expendable properties;

We recommended that the Executive Director direct the Property fficer to
issue the ICS to the end-users of semi-expendable items to monitor and
pinpoint accountability, copy furnished the Accounting Section, and submit the
same to the Audit Team for verification.

c) under/non-provision of depreciation of Technical and Scientific Equipment and
lnformation and Communications Technology (lCT) Equipment;



d) failure to dispose four unserviceable motor vehicles amounting to
P1,899,708.30, contrary to Sections 63 and 64 of the Manual on the New
Government Accounting System (MNGAS), Volume ll, thereby exposing the
same to further deterioration, hence lessening their saleable value.

We recommended that the Executive Director direct the Disposal Management
Team to conduct the re-appraisal of all unserviceable properties, and cause the
disposal of the same as soon as possible to prevent further deterioration and to
get the higher saleable price for the unserviceable motor vehicles-

4. No amortization for calendar year (CY) 2020 was recognized on lntangible Assets-
Computer Software account amounting to P563,441.29, thereby understating the
Amortization-lntangible Assets, Computer Software and the Accumulated
Amortization-Computer Software accounts and overstatement of lntangible Assets
as of year-end. This is contrary to Section 9, Chapter 12 of GAM for NGAs, Volume
I and Annex A of COA Circular No. 2O2O-001 dated January 8, 2020, which
contains the lists and descriptions of all accounts in the Revised Chart of Accounts
(Updated 2019).

We recommended that the Executive Director instruct the Accountant to:
(a) assess the estimated useful life of the Computer Software and compute for the
amortization for CY 2020, in accordance with the mentioned provisions of GAM for
NGAS, Volume l; and (b) prepare the necessary adjusting entry to reflect the
accurate balance of lntangible Assets and related Accumulated Amortization
accounts in the books of accounts of the PCAARRD.

5. The reported balance of lnventory accounts of P10,259,039.14 as of December 3'1,
2020, was unreliable due to: (a) non-conduc{ of physical count on Other Supplies and
Materials lnventory amounting lo P8@4,412.82 and unreconciled discrepancy of
P5,262,389.45 between the GL balance and the Report on the Physical Count of
lnventories (RPCI) for Office Supplies lnventory; (b) presence of negative balances
in the SL and schedule of inventories maintained by the Accounting Section; and
(c) undetermined status of Semi-Expendable Properties amour ing to P2,693,523.87
due to non-maintenance of supplies ledger cards and stocks cards, and failure to
prepare and submit the Report of Supplies and Materials lssued (RSMI) and ICS
to record issuance thereof.

We recommended that the Executive Director: (a) direct the lnventory Committee
to include all unissued lnventories in the actual physical count, and prepare and
submit the RPCI thereon not later than July 3'l and January 3'l of each year for the
first and second semesters, respectively; (b) instruct the Accounting and Property
Sections to prepare and maintain the Supplies Ledger Cards and the Stock Cards
in the e-NGAS and the PCAARRD Procurement and lnventory Monitoring System
(PPIMS), respectively, to recognize the receipt and issuances of all inventories and
conduct periodic reconciliation of their respective records; (c) direcl the Property

We recommended that the Executive Director instruct the Accountant to
compute the depreciation of the said Technical and Scientific Equipment and
ICT Equipment based on the estimated useful life of the asset, and make the
necessary adjustment in the books based on the computation, in accordance
with ltems e and i, Section 27, Chapler 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume l.



Section to prepare and submit the RSMI based on Requisition and lssue Slip (RlS)
and ICS to the Accounting Section as basis in preparing the Journal Entry Voucher
(JE\4 to record the supplies and materials issued for the month; (d) direct the
Accounting and Property Sections to trace and reconcile the noted material
discrepancy of P5,262,389.45, and make necessary adjusting entries duly
supported with proper schedules and documents; and (e) direct the Accounting
Section to reconcile the subsidiary ledger balances and schedule of inventories,
and work back on pertinent records to establish the cause of negative balances
and effect the necessary adjustments to conect the errors, and henceforth,
exercise due diligence in making journal entries.

6. The Due to NGAs account as of December 31,2020, of P3'915,157.74 remain
unrefunded and/or unliquidated for less than one year to over six years despite
completion of the projects, contrary to Sections 6.5 and 6.7 of COA Circular No.
94-013 dated December 13, 1994, thus exposed the funds to possible
misappropriation or misapplication. Moreover, due to lack of monitoring of the
status of funds, 12 p@ects showed abnormal negative balances of P379,46'1 66
and unreconciled variance of P(1,739,963.53) per confirmation with Technology
Application and Promotion lnstitute (TAPI).

We recommended that the Executive Director direct the concerned
Program/Project Leader to coordinate with the Accounting Section to establish the
status of each project, and to prepare the conesponding Financial/Terminal
Reports immedaately upon completion of the project, and cause the subsequent
settlement of the unexpended funds received from the source agencies-

We also recommended that the Executive Director instruct the Accountant to.
(a) designate a focal person who would be responsible in monitoring the status of
project implementatlon of funds received from source agencies, in coordination
with the ProgramiProject Leader; (b) locate the Memorandum of Agreement
(MOA)/Trust Agreements with the source agencies and Financial/Terminal
Reports, and perform reconciliation with the concerned Program/Project Leader to
settle the balance of P3,915,157.74 of the completed projects; (c) review prior
years' transactions to determine the cause of abnormal negative balance of
P379,461.66, and prepare the necessary adjustments to reflect correc{ balances of
the affected SLs; (d) analyze the Due to PCAMRD accounts and effect the proper
adjustments to settle the unliquidated balance, if warranted; and (e) record in the
books of accounts the laquidations submitted by the Program/Project Leader,
submit the Financial/Terminal Reports and refund the excess project funds to the
source/funding agencies immediately after the completion of the project, in
compliance with Sections 6.5 and 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013.

7. The absence of proper monitoring and reconciliation of accounts resulted in
abnormal negative balances of Due to BlR, GSIS, Pag-lBlG, and PhilHealth
subsidiary accounts amounting lo P2,18O,298.25, P245,92O.61, P19,066.88 and
P8,770.09, and unreconciled balances of P320,05,l .63, P33,267.86, and
P70,929.20 and P2Op52.6Z respectively. Thus, fairness of the said accounts in
the financial statements cannot be relied upon.

We recommended that the Executive Director direct the Accountant to: (a) trace to
prior years' accounting entries to ascertain the cause of abnormal negative



balances; (b) revieu, and analyze records pertaining to the unreconciled balances
in the SLs of the Due to BlR, GSIS, PaglBlG and PhilHealth accounts; and(c)
immediately adjust the unreconciled and abnormal account balances to conecl and
update SL balances, and/or refund over remittances, if there are any.

Due to the strict implernentation of the Modified Enhanced Community Quaranline
(MECO) in Laguna Province and considering that the face.to-face m€etings are still
highly discouraged, the exit con€rence on the results of audit on the accounts ard
operationsof the PCAARRD for CY 2020ras not conducted. ln lieu of the exit
conference, the other audit observations, together with the recomrnerded courses of
ac{ion, were presented by the Audit Team with the concemed Management officials thru
the issuance of Audit Highlights on May 7, 2021, as discussed in d€tail in Part ll of this
Report. Management's @mments were incorporatod in the Report, where appropriate.

We respectfully request that the recommendations contained in Part ll ot the Report b€
implemented, and that this Commission be informed of the actions taken thereon by
accomplishing th6 Agency Ac{ion Plan and Status of lmpl€mentation form (copy
attached) and retuming the same within 60 days ftom the date of receipt hereof.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 
Introduction 
 
The Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and 
Development (PCAARRD) is one of the sectoral councils under the Department of 
Science and Technology (DOST).  The PCAARRD was established on June 22, 2011, 
through the consolidation of the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural 
Resources and Development (PCARRD) and the Philippine Council for Aquatic and 
Marine Research and Development (PCAMRD). 
 
The Council formulates policies, plans and programs for Science and Technology (S&T)-
based Research and Development (R&D) in the different sectors under its concern.  It 
coordinates, evaluates and monitors the national research and development efforts in 
the Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources (AANR) sectors. It also allocates 
government and external funds for R&D, and generates resources to support its 
program. 
 
As a leader in providing S&T solutions for AANR development, the PCAARRD promotes 
active partnerships with international, regional, and national organizations and funding 
institutions for joint R&D; human resource development and training; technical 
assistance; and exchange of scientists, information and technologies. 
 
The PCAARRD also supports the National Agriculture and Resources Research and 
Development Network (NAARRDN) composed of national multi and single-commodity 
and regional R&D centers, cooperating stations and specialized agencies. 
 
Being an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001:2008-certified 
agency for its quality management system, the PCAARRD is committed to advance and 
foster partnerships and reinforce the culture of relevance, excellence and cooperation 
through its good governance and continual improvement programs. As such, the 
PCAARRD will remain steadfast in catalysing the Philippine AANR sectors toward self-
sufficiency and global competitiveness. 
 
The PCAARRD has the following mandates: 
  

 Formulates policies, plans, programs, projects and strategies for S&T 
development in the agriculture, forestry, aquatic and natural resources sectors; 

 

 Programs and allocates government and external funds generated for R&D 
efforts in the agriculture, forestry, marine and natural resources sectors; 

 

 Monitors R&D projects; and 
 

 Generates external funds for its R&D activities.

Scope of Audit 
 
The audit covered the review of the accounts and operations for CY 2020.  The audit 
was conducted to: (a) verify the levels of assurance that may be placed on 
Management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) recommend agency 
improvement opportunities; and (c) determine the extent of implementation of prior 
years’ audit recommendations. 



iii 

 

Audit Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the 
financial statements of the PCAARRD for CY 2020 due to the effects in the financial 
statements of the following deficiencies noted: 
 
1. The delayed or non-submission of disbursement vouchers, trial balances, 

financial statements and supporting schedules precluded the prompt audit of 
accounts and financial transactions, early detection and correction of 
errors/deficiencies and timely reporting of the audit results to Management, in 
contravention with Section 122(2) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, Section 
7.2.1 of the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) as 
prescribed under Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2009-006 and Section 
60, Chapter 19 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 
Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. 
 

2. The PCAARRD’s assertions on the validity and reliability of the Due from NGAs, 
Local Government Units (LGUs), and Non-Government Organizations/People’s 
Organizations (NGOs/POs) account balances amounting to P2,476,909,778.19, 
P7,119,206.00 and P73,165,410.32, respectively, were doubtful due to:             
(a) reported discrepancies of P50,113,362.48 between book balance with the 
confirmed balances from 11 Implementing Agencies (IAs); (b) erroneous 
posting/recording of fund releases and liquidations/refund; and (c) outstanding 
balance of P1.827 billion remain unliquidated despite completion of the project 
duration, thereby affecting the fair presentation of the accounts. This is contrary 
to Sections 6.5 and 5.4 of COA Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2007-001, respectively. 

 
3. The Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account’s balance as of December 31, 

2020, of P202,789,057.98 (gross), is of doubtful validity and reliability, due to the:   
(a) difference of P2,641,895.67 between  the  General Ledger balance and the 
Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE);      

(b) absence of Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) on derecognized PPE items 
accounted as semi-expendable properties; (c) under/non-provision of 
depreciation on Technical and Scientific Equipment and Information and 
Communications Technology (ICT) Equipment accounts; and (d) non-disposal of 
four unserviceable motor vehicles amounting to P1,899,708.30, thus affecting the 
fair presentation of the PPE and other related accounts in the financial 
statements. 

 
4. No amortization for CY 2020 was recognized on Intangible Assets-Computer 

Software account amounting to P563,441.29, thereby understating the 
Amortization-Intangible Assets, Computer Software and the Accumulated 
Amortization-Computer Software accounts, and overstatement of Intangible 
Assets as of year-end. This is contrary to Section 9, Chapter 12 of GAM for 
NGAs, Volume I and Annex A of COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 
2020, which contain the lists and descriptions of all accounts in the Revised 
Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019). 

 
5. The reported balance of Inventory accounts of P10,259,039.14 as of December 31, 

2020, was unreliable due to: (a) non-conduct of physical count on Other Supplies and 
Materials Inventory amounting to P864,412.82 and unreconciled discrepancy of 



iv 

 

P5,262,389.45 between the General Ledger (GL) balance and the Report on the 
Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) for Office Supplies Inventory; (b) presence 
of negative balances in the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) and schedule of inventories 
maintained by the Accounting Section; and (c) undetermined status of Semi-
Expendable Properties amounting to P2,693,523.87 due to non-maintenance of 
supplies ledger cards and stocks cards, and failure to prepare and submit the 
Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) and ICS to record issuance 
thereof. 

 
6. The Due to NGAs account as of December 31, 2020, of P3,915,157.74 remain 

unrefunded and/or unliquidated for less than one year to over six years despite 
completion of the projects, contrary to Sections 6.5 and 6.7 of COA Circular No. 
94-013 dated December 13, 1994, thus exposed the funds to possible 
misappropriation or misapplication. Moreover, due to lack of monitoring of the 
status of funds, 12 projects showed abnormal negative balances of P379,461.66 
and unreconciled variance of P(1,739,963.53) per confirmation with Technology 
Application and Promotion Institute (TAPI). 

 
7. Absence of proper monitoring and reconciliation of accounts resulted in abnormal 

negative balances of Due to BIR, GSIS, Pag-IBIG, and PhilHealth subsidiary 
accounts amounting to P2,180,298.25, P245,920.61, P49,066.88 and P8,770.09, 
and unreconciled balances of P320,051.63, P33,267.86, and P70,929.20 and 
P20,052.62, respectively. Thus, fairness of the said accounts in the financial 
statements cannot be relied upon.  

 
 
Significant Observations and Recommendations

v 

 

 
b) instruct the Accountant to prepare journal entry to reclassify the Municipal 
Treasurer account to Due from LGUs account, and to ensure that the Subsidiary

transactions. 
 
c) instruct the Accountant to: (a) revisit all completed projects with outstanding 
balances and coordinate with the Project Managers/Project Leaders and IAs for

Section 3 (c and d) of Department of Science and Technology (DOST) 
Administrative Order (AO) No. 009, series of 2017; (b) issue “Certification by the 
Accountant that funds previously transferred to the Implementing Agency (lA) has 
been liquidated and accounted for in the books” prior to granting of subsequent 
releases, and consider stopping the processing of Disbursement Voucher (DV) 
for fund transfer involving new projects to the IAs with significant unliquidated 
balances for completed projects, pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-002; and (c) 
exhaust all legal remedies to compel the concerned IAs and NGOs/POs to

coordinate with the Accounting Section to reconcile the Property Cards with the 
PPE Ledger Cards (PPELCs); (c) the Accounting Section to take-up necessary 
journal entries to recognize PPEs found at station, including the unrecorded 
Furniture and Fixtures amounting to P348,893.00, and prepare/maintain the

of all its PPE, whether acquired through purchase or donation, and prepare and 
submit the RPCPPE, in compliance with Section 38, Chapter 10 of GAM for 
NGAs, Volume I; ensure that full reconciliation of the inventory count 
documented in RPCPPE with the records maintained by Accounting Section is 
properly made to establish the correct balance of PPE, and strictly comply with 
the guidelines and procedures on inventory-taking, recognition of those found at 
station and disposition for non-existing/missing PPE items for the one-time 
cleansing of PPE accounts of the PCAARRD, in accordance with COA Circular 
No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020; and (e) the Property and Accounting 
Sections to perform periodic reconciliation of their records to ensure that all 
discrepancies are immediately investigated, cleared and reconciled.  

 
b) direct the Property Officer to issue the ICS to the end-users of those semi-
expendable items to monitor and pinpoint accountability, copy furnished the 
Accounting Section, and submit the same to the Audit Team for verification. 
 
c) instruct the Accountant to compute the depreciation of the said Technical and 
Scientific Equipment and ICT Equipment based on the estimated useful life of the 
asset, and make the necessary adjustment in the books based on the 



vi 

 

computation, in accordance with Items e and i, Section 27, Chapter 10 of GAM 
for NGAs, Volume I.  

 
d) direct the Disposal Management Team to conduct the re-appraisal of all 
unserviceable properties, and cause the disposal of the same as soon as 
possible to prevent further deterioration, and to get the higher saleable price for 
the unserviceable motor vehicles. 

 
4. instruct the Accountant to: (a) assess the estimated useful life of the Computer 

Software and compute for the amortization for CY 2020, in accordance with the 
aforementioned provisions of GAM for NGAS, Volume I; and (b) prepare the

related Accumulated Amortization accounts in the books of accounts of the 
PCAARRD. 
 

5. (a) direct the Inventory Committee to include all unissued Inventories in the 
actual physical count, and prepare and submit the RPCI thereon not later than 
July 31 and January 31 of each year for the first and second semesters, 
respectively; (b) instruct the Accounting and Property Sections to prepare and 
maintain the Supplies Ledger Cards and the Stock Cards in the e-NGAS and the 
PCAARRD Procurement and Inventory Monitoring System (PPIMS), respectively,

reconciliation of their respective records; (c) direct the Property Section to 
prepare and submit the RSMI based on RIS and ICS to the Accounting Section, 
as basis in preparing the Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) to record the supplies and 
materials issued for the month; (d) direct the Accounting and Property Sections 
to trace and reconcile the noted material discrepancy of P5,262,389.45, and 
make the necessary adjusting entries duly supported with proper schedules and 
documents; and (e) direct the Accounting Section to reconcile the subsidiary 
ledger balances and schedule of inventories, and work back on pertinent records 
to establish the cause of negative balances and effect the necessary adjustments 
to correct the errors, and  henceforth, exercise due diligence in making  journal  
entries. 
 

6. direct the concerned Program/Project Leader to coordinate with the Accounting 
Section to establish the status of each project, and to prepare the corresponding 
Financial/Terminal Reports immediately upon completion of the project, and 
cause the subsequent settlement of the unexpended funds received from the 
source agencies. 
 
We also recommended that the Executive Director instruct the Accountant to: (a) 
designate a focal person who would be responsible in monitoring the status of 
project implementation of funds received from source agencies, in coordination 
with the Program/Project Leader; (b) locate the Memorandum of Agreement 
(MOA)/Trust Agreements with the source agencies and Financial/Terminal 
Reports, and perform reconciliation with the concerned Program/Project Leader

P379,461.66, and prepare the necessary adjustments to reflect correct balances 
of the affected SLs; (d) analyze the Due to PCAMRD accounts and effect the 
necessary adjustments to settle the unliquidated balance, if warranted; and (e) 



vii

Leader, submit the Financial/Terminal Reports and refund the excess project 
funds to the source/funding agencies immediately after the completion of the 
project, in compliance with Sections 6.5 and 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013. 
 

7. direct the Accountant to: (a) trace to prior years’ accounting entries to ascertain 
the cause of abnormal negative balances; (b) review and analyze records 
pertaining to the unreconciled balances in the SLs of the Due to BIR, GSIS, Pag-
IBIG and PhilHealth accounts; and (c) immediately adjust the unreconciled and 
abnormal account balances to correct and update SL balances, and/or refund 
over remittances, if there are any. 

 
The deficiencies noted in the course of audit were earlier communicated through Audit 
Observation Memoranda (AOMs) and presented in Audit Highlights on May 7, 2021, with 
the concerned officials. 
 
The following are the other significant observations in the course of the audit and our 
recommended corrective measures: 
 
1. Non-compliance with existing government policies/guidelines in maintaining the 

Petty Cash Fund (PCF) resulted in delayed liquidation of PCVs, excessive PCF 
requirement for one month, and disbursements include regular expenses not 
related to the purpose of the PCF and were not supported with complete 
documentations, contrary to Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445, thus exposed the fund 
to the risk of loss and mishandling.  

 
We recommended that Management: (a) reassess the accurate amount of PCF 
and prepare a duly approved estimates of petty expenses to be incurred for one 
month, and establish policies concerning the use of PCF, in compliance with 
Section 36, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I; (b) require the PCF 
Custodian to strictly adhere to the existing government rules, regulations and 
policies on the handling of the PCF subject to the proper use and liquidation of 
the fund, and properly accomplish the Petty Cash Voucher and Petty Cash Fund 
Record, in accordance with Appendices 48 and 50 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II; 
(c) instruct the PCF Custodian and the Accountant to refrain from charging 
regular expenses, pursuant to Section 35, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I 
and COA Circular No. 2012-001, and identify expenses that should be paid 
through checks; and (d) direct the PCF Custodian to ensure that the claims 
thereof are supported with complete information/details, and the liquidations are 
supported with complete documentations. 

 
2. The PCAARRD did not provide a complete list of all its ongoing projects, and 

those that are to be implemented during the year at the prescribed time specified 
under Item 2.1 of COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 2013. Likewise, 
they did not submit to the Audit Team copy of contracts and supporting 
documents on the 31 procurement projects with total contract amount of 
P43,948,812.74, within five working days from execution thereof, contrary to Item 
3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, thus preventing 
the Audit Team  in conducting timely review of the procurement activities. 

 



viii 

 

We recommended that the Executive Director: (a) direct the concerned officials 
to prepare the complete list of all ongoing PPAs and those that are to be 
implemented during the year, for audit validation and verification; and (b) instruct 
the PCAARRD’s Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) Secretariat to provide valid 
explanations on non-submission of the contracts and supporting documents 
pertaining to the above projects. 
 
We further recommended that henceforth, the guidelines prescribed in COA 
Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, on the submission of contracts 
and supporting documents within five working days from the execution of a 
contract/purchase order be strictly complied by the BAC Secretariat. 

 
 
Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations 

 
The Audit Team validated the actions taken by the PCAARRD to implement the audit 
recommendations contained in the 2019 and 2018 Annual Audit Reports (AARs). Of the 
46 audit recommendations, 22 were fully implemented, 22 were partially implemented 
and two were not implemented. 
 
 
Unsettled Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 
 
The Statement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges (SASDC) of the 
Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and 
Development (PCAARRD) as of December 31, 2020 shows the following balances: 
 

Audit Suspensions    P3,190,296.00  
Audit Disallowances     P 0.00 
Audit Charges     P 0.00

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
 
 
Dr. REYNALDO V. EBORA 
Executive Director  
Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural 
     Resources Research and Development 
Los Baños, Laguna 
 
 
Qualified Opinion 
 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of the Philippine Council for 
Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCAARRD), 
which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as at December 31, 2020, and the 
Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity, 
Statement of Cash Flows, Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts for 
the year then ended, and Notes to Financial Statements including a summary of 
significant accounting policies. 
 
In our opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the Bases for Qualified 
Opinion section of our report, the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the PCAARRD as at 
December 31, 2020, and its financial performance, changes in net assets/equity, cash 
flows, and comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended in 
accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). 
 
Bases for Qualified Opinion 
 
1. The delayed or non-submission of disbursement vouchers, trial balances, financial 

statements and supporting schedules precluded the prompt audit of accounts and 
financial transactions, early detection and correction of errors/deficiencies and 
timely reporting of the audit results to Management, in contravention with Section 
122(2) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, Section 7.2.1 of the Rules and 
Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) as prescribed under Commission 
on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2009-006 and Section 60, Chapter 19 of Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. 

 
2. The PCAARRD’s assertions on the validity and reliability of the Due from NGAs, 

Local Government Units (LGUs), and Non-Government Organizations/People’s 
Organizations (NGOs/POs) account balances amounting to P2,476,909,778.19, 
P7,119,206.00 and P73,165,410.32, respectively, were doubtful due to: (a) reported 
discrepancies of P50,113,362.48 between book balance with the confirmed 
balances from 11 Implementing Agencies (IAs); (b) erroneous posting/recording of 
fund releases and liquidations/refund; and (c) outstanding balance of P1.827 billion 



2 
 

remain unliquidated despite completion of the project duration, thereby affecting the 
fair presentation of the accounts. This is contrary to Sections 6.5 and 5.4 of COA 
Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2007-001, respectively. 

 
3. The Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account’s balance as of December 31, 

2020, of P202,789,057.98 (gross) is of doubtful validity and reliability due to the:        
(a) difference of P2,641,895.67 between the General Ledger balance and the 
Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE);           
(b) absence of Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) on derecognized PPE items 
accounted as semi-expendable properties; (c) under/non-provision of depreciation 
on Technical and Scientific Equipment and Information and Communications 
Technology (ICT) Equipment accounts; and (d) non-disposal of four unserviceable 
motor vehicles amounting to P1,899,708.30, thus affecting the fair presentation of 
the PPE and other related accounts in the financial statements. 

 
4. No amortization for calendar year (CY) 2020 was recognized on Intangible Assets-

Computer Software account amounting to P563,441.29, thereby understating the 
Amortization-Intangible Assets, Computer Software and the Accumulated 
Amortization-Computer Software accounts, and overstatement of Intangible Assets 
as of year-end. This is contrary to Section 9, Chapter 12 of GAM for NGAs, Volume 
I and Annex A of COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020, which contain 
the lists and descriptions of all accounts in the Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 
2019). 

 
5. The reported balance of Inventory accounts of P10,259,039.14 as of December 31, 

2020, was unreliable due to: (a) non-conduct of physical count on Other Supplies and 
Materials Inventory amounting to P864,412.82 and unreconciled discrepancy of 
P5,262,389.45 between the General Ledger (GL) balance and the Report on the 
Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) for Office Supplies Inventory; (b) presence of 
negative balances in the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) and schedule of inventories 
maintained by the Accounting Section; and (c) undetermined status of Semi-
Expendable Properties amounting to P2,693,523.87 due to non-maintenance of 
supplies ledger cards and stocks cards, and failure to prepare and submit the 
Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) and ICS to record issuance thereof. 

 
6. The Due to NGAs account as of December 31, 2020 of P3,915,157.74 remain 

unrefunded and/or unliquidated for less than one year to over six years despite 
completion of the projects, contrary to Sections 6.5 and 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-
013 dated December 13, 1994, thus exposed the funds to possible misappropriation 
or misapplication. Moreover, due to lack of monitoring of the status of funds, 12 
projects showed abnormal negative balances of P379,461.66 and unreconciled 
variance of P(1,739,963.53) per confirmation with Technology Application and 
Promotion Institute (TAPI). 

 
7. Absence of proper monitoring and reconciliation of accounts resulted in abnormal 

negative balances of Due to BIR, GSIS, Pag-IBIG, and PhilHealth subsidiary 
accounts amounting to P2,180,298.25, P245,920.61, P49,066.88 and P8,770.09, 
and unreconciled balances of P320,051.63, P33,267.86, and P70,929.20 and 
P20,052.62, respectively. Thus, fairness of the said accounts in the financial 
statements cannot be relied upon.  

 



3 
 

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 
Institutions (ISSAIs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in 
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the agency in accordance with the Revised Code of 
Conduct and Ethical Standards for Commission on Audit Officials and Employees (Code 
of Ethics) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the Philippines, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion. 
 
Key Audit Matters 
 
Except for the matters described in the bases for the Qualified Opinion Section, we have 
determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report. 
 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the 
Financial Statements 
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in accordance with IPSAS, and for such internal control as Management 
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the agency’s financial 
reporting process. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or 
error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of these financial statements.

Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and 
Development (PCAARRD) 

 
Notes to Financial Statements 

For the year ended December 31, 2020 
 
 

1. General Information/Agency Profile 
 
1.1 The financial statements of the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and 

Natural Resources Research and Development (PCAARRD) were authorized for 
issue on February 11, 2021 as shown in the Statement of Management’s 
Responsibility for Financial Statements signed by Dr. Reynaldo V. Ebora, the 
Head of Agency. 
 

1.2 The PCAARRD is a sectoral planning council of the Department of Science and 
Technology (DOST) established on June 22, 2011, through the issuance of 
Executive Order (EO) No. 366 which consolidated the Philippine Council for 
Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research and Development 
(PCARRD) and the Philippine Council for Aquatic and Marine Research and 
Development (PCAMRD). The Agency's registered office is located in Bureau of 
Plant Industry (BPI) Economic Garden, Los Baños, Laguna. 

 
 

2. Statement of Compliance and Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements  
 
2.1 The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and comply with 

the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) issued by the 
Commission on Audit (COA) per COA Resolution No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 
2020. 
 

2.2 The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, unless 
stated otherwise. The Statement of Cash Flows is prepared using the direct 
method.  

 
 

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
3.1 Basis of Accounting 
 

The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with the 
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS).  

 
a. Trusts Under Administration 

 
Trusts administered by the PCAARRD are in the financial statements as they 
are controlled by the Agency. 

 
 
 



 

 

 

11 

 

 
b. Financial Liabilities 

 
Initial Recognition and Measurement 
 
Financial liabilities within the scope of IPSAS 29 are classified as financial 
liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit or loans and borrowings, as 
appropriate. The entity determines the classification of its financial liabilities at 
initial recognition. 
 
All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value plus directly 
attributable transaction costs.  

 
The PCAARRD’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables. 

 
3.2 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash in bank. For the 
purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents 
consist of cash and short-term deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank 
overdrafts. 

 
3.3 Inventories 
 

Inventory is measured at cost upon initial recognition. To the extent that inventory 
was received through non-exchange transactions (for no cost or for a nominal 
cost), the cost of the inventory is its fair value at the date of acquisition. 
 
After initial recognition, inventory is measured at the lower of cost and net 
realizable value. However, to the extent that a class of inventory is distributed or 
deployed at no charge or for a nominal charge, that class of inventory is measured 
at the lower of cost and current replacement cost. 
 
Inventories are recognized as expenses when deployed for utilization or 
consumption in the ordinary course of operations of the PCAARRD. 

 
3.4 Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) 
 

Recognition 
 

An item is recognized as PPE if it meets the characteristics and recognition criteria 
as a PPE. 
 
The characteristics of PPE are as follows: 

 

 tangible items; 
 

 are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental 
to others, or for administrative purposes; and 

 



 

 

 

12 

 

 are expected to be used during more than one reporting period. 
 

An item of PPE is recognized as an asset if:  
 

 it is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated 
with the item will flow to the entity; and 

 

 the cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably. 
 

Measurement at Recognition 
 
An item recognized as PPE is measured at cost. 
 
A PPE acquired through non-exchange transaction is measured at its fair value as 
at the date of acquisition. 
 
The cost of the PPE is the cash price equivalent, or for PPE acquired through non-
exchange transaction, its cost is its fair value as at recognition date.  
 
Cost includes the following: 

 

 Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase 
taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates; 

 

 Expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items; and 
 

 Initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and 
restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity 
incurs either when the item is acquired, or as a consequence of having 
used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce 
inventories during that period. 

 
Measurement After Recognition 
 
After recognition, all PPE are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses.  
 
When significant parts of PPE are required to be replaced at intervals, the 
PCAARRD recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives 
and depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major repair/replacement is 
done, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a 
replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.  
 
All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense in surplus or 
deficit as incurred.  
 
Depreciation 
 
Each part of an item of PPE with a cost that is significant in relation to the total 
cost of the item is depreciated separately. 



 

 

 

13 

 

 
The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expense unless it is 
included in the cost of another asset. 
 
Initial Recognition of Depreciation 
 
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in 
the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner 
intended by Management.   
 
For simplicity and to avoid proportionate computation, the depreciation is for one 
month if the PPE is available for use on or before the 15th of the month. However, 
if the PPE is available for use after the 15th of the month, depreciation is for the 
succeeding month. 
 
Depreciation Method 
 
The straight line method of depreciation is adopted unless another method is more 
appropriate for agency operation. 
 
Estimated Useful Life 
 
The PCAARRD uses the Schedule on the Estimated Useful Life of PPE by 
classification prepared by the Commission on Audit (COA). 
 
The PCAARRD uses a residual value equivalent to at least five percent of the cost 
of the PPE. 
 
Impairment  
 
An asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount, or 
recoverable service amount, if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its 
estimated recoverable service amount. 
 
Derecognition 
 
The PCAARRD derecognizes items of PPE and/or any significant part of an asset 
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected 
from its continuing use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset 
(calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset) is included in the surplus or deficit when the asset is 
derecognized. 

 
3.5 Changes in Accounting Policies and Estimates 

 
The PCAARRD recognizes the effects of changes in accounting policy 
retrospectively. The effects of changes in accounting policy were applied 
prospectively if retrospective application is impractical. 
 
 



 

 

 

14 

 

The PCAARRD recognizes the effects of changes in accounting estimates 
prospectively by including in surplus or deficit. 
 
The PCAARRD corrects material prior period’s errors retrospectively in the first set 
of financial statements authorized for issue after their discovery by: 

 

 restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in which 
the error occurred; or  

 

 if the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating the 
opening balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for the earliest 
prior period presented. 

 
3.6 Foreign Currency Transactions 
 

Transactions in foreign currencies were initially recognized by applying the spot 
exchange rate between the function currency and the foreign currency at the 
transaction.  
 
At each reporting date: 

 

 Foreign currency monetary items were translated using the closing rate; 
 

 Non-monetary items that were measured in terms of historical cost in a 
foreign currency were translated using the exchange rate at the date of the 
transaction; and 

 

 Non-monetary items that were measured at fair value in a foreign currency 
were translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value 
was determined. 

 
Exchange differences arising (a) on the settlement of monetary items, or (b) on 
translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were 
translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous financial 
statements, were recognized in surplus or deficit in the period in which they arise, 
except as those arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entity’s 
net investment in a foreign operation. 

 
3.7 Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions 

 
Recognition and Measurement of Assets from Non-Exchange Transactions 
 
An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction, other than services in-
kind, that meets the definition of an asset were recognized as an asset if the 
following criteria were met: 
 

 It is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential 
associated with the asset will flow to the entity; and 

 

 The fair value of the asset can be measured reliably. 



 

 

 

15 

 

An asset acquired through a non-exchange transaction is initially measured at its 
fair value as at the date of acquisition. 
 
Measurement of Liabilities on Initial Recognition from Non-Exchange 
Transactions 
 
The amount recognized as a liability in a non-exchange transaction is the best 
estimate of the amount required to settle the present obligation at the reporting 
date. 
 
Transfers from Other Government Entities 
 
Revenues from non-exchange transactions with other government entities and the 
related assets were measured at fair value and recognized on obtaining control of 
the asset (cash, goods, services and property) if the transfer is free from 
conditions, and it is probable that the economic benefits or service potential related 
to the asset will flow to the PCAARRD and can be measured reliably. 

 
3.8 Revenue from Exchange transactions 
 

Measurement of Revenue 
 
Revenue was measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable. 
 
Sale of Goods 
 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, usually on delivery of 
the goods and when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is 
probable that the economic benefits or service potential associated with the 
transaction will flow to the PCAARRD. 
 
Interest Income 
 
Interest income is accrued using the effective yield method. The effective yield 
discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial 
asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. The method applies this yield to the 
principal outstanding to determine interest income each period. 

 
3.9 Budget Information 
 

The annual budget is prepared on a cash basis and is published in the government 
website.  
 
A separate Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts (SCBAA) was 
prepared since the budget and the financial statements were not prepared on 
comparable basis. The SCBAA was presented showing the original and final 
budget and the actual amounts on comparable basis to the budget. Explanatory 
comments are provided in the notes to the annual financial statements. 



 

 

 

16 

 

 
The annual budget figures included in the financial statements were for the 
controlling entity PCAARRD. These budget figures were those approved by the 
governing body both at the beginning and during the year following a period of 
consultation with the public. 

 
3.10 Related Parties 

 
The Governing Council (GC) is the PCAARRD’s highest policy-making body. It 
formulates policies, strategies and rules and regulations on the administration of 
the national Research and Development (R&D) system; determines the national 
priority R&D areas for the Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources (AANR); 
approves the budget to support the AANR R&D programs; and ensures that the 
approved programs are supported by partners and other national government 
agencies. 
 
The Directors’ Council (DC) is the management body of the Secretariat composed 
of the Executive Director as the chair, two Deputy Executive Directors and the 
Directors of the various PCAARRD units. The DC defines R&D priorities and 
reviews the national R&D program. 
 
The PCAARRD Secretariat implements the GC-approved policies and guidelines. 

 
3.11 Service Concession Arrangements 

 
The PCAARRD analyzes all aspects of service concession arrangements that it 
enters into in determining the appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure 
requirements.  

 
3.12 Employee Benefits 

 
The employees of PCAARRD are members of the Government Service Insurance 
System (GSIS), which provides life and retirement insurance coverage, and the 
Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth), which implements health 
insurance coverage. 
 
The PCAARRD recognizes the undiscounted amount of short term employee 
benefits, like salaries, wages, bonuses, allowance, etc., as expense unless 
capitalized, and as a liability after deducting the amount paid. 
 
The PCAARRD recognizes expenses for accumulating compensated absences 
when these were paid (commuted or paid as terminal leave benefits). Unused 
entitlements that have accumulated at the reporting date were not recognized as 
expenses. Non-accumulating compensated absences, like special leave privileges, 
were also not recognized. 

 
 
 
 
 



 

 

 

17 

 

4. Changes in Accounting Policies 
 

On January 1, 2015, the PCAARRD adopted the IPSASs No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 12 and 17. 
The new standard is effective for years beginning on January 1, 2015. This accounting 
change had no significant impact on the agency’s financial statements.  
 

5. Prior Period Adjustments 
 
The PCAARRD has determined adjustments/liquidations of prior year fund releases 
and corrections of prior years’ entries. As a result, the opening balance of the 
Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) in current year is restated.

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

1. The delayed or non-submission of disbursement vouchers, trial balances, 
financial statements and supporting schedules precluded the prompt audit of 
accounts and financial transactions, early detection and correction of 
errors/deficiencies and timely reporting of the audit results to Management, in 
contravention with Section 122(2) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, Section 
7.2.1 of the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) as 
prescribed under Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2009-006 and Section 
60, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 
Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I. 
 
Section 122 of PD No. 1445 provides: 
 

“Submission of Reports. Whenever deemed necessary in the exigencies 
of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it require 
the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, 
disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers and other 
responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, 
physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other 
reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions. 
 
(2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the documents 
and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension of 
payment of their salaries until they have complied with the requirements 
of the Commission.” 

 
Section 7.2 of the RRSA prescribed under COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 
15, 2009, cites the responsibility of the Accountant in the submission of reports and 
accounts as follows: 
 

“7.2.1 The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official 
performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the audited 
agency shall ensure that: 
 
a. The reports and supporting documents submitted by the accountable 

officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and 
submitted to the Auditor within the first ten (10) days of ensuing 
month.” 

 
Moreover, Section 60, Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides: 

 
“c. Central/Head/Main Offices 
 

Entity/Office Statement/Report Deadline Submit to:

Records showed that the Accounting Section failed to fully comply with the timely 
submission to the Auditor of all paid Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) and their supporting 
documents, Liquidation Reports (LRs) and Report of Collections and Deposits (RCDs) of 
all funds, from January to December of CY 2020, within the first ten days of the ensuing 
month. Audit revealed that the delays in submission of accounts of the PCAARRD 
ranged from one to 378 days as of reporting date. The quantity and number of days of 
delay in the submission of these DVs, LRs and RCDs are presented in detail in Annex 
A. 
 
Likewise, verification disclosed that the following DVs listed in the Report of 
Disbursements, LRs and RCDs, remained not submitted as of the report date, to wit: 
 

Particulars 
No. of Unsubmitted Accounts 

Account No. 2189-
9007-60 (Fund 101) 

Account No. 2189-
9007-78 (Fund 184) 

A. Disbursement Vouchers 419 163 

B. Liquidation Reports 4 6 

C. Report of Collections and Deposits 7 7 

 
From the above table, it is apparent that Management did not submit the required 
reports and DVs, together with the corresponding supporting documents, despite 
numerous verbal follow-ups reiterating their submission. 
 
It was also noted that the monthly Trial Balance (TB) and quarterly Financial Statements 
and their supporting schedules for CY 2020 were patently not submitted to the Audit 
Team, in violation of Section 7.2 of the RRSA as prescribed under COA Circular No. 
2009-006 and Section 60, Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.  
 
Management averred that some of the vouchers are pending for complete 
documentation before submission to the Audit Team. 
 
The non-submission and/or late submission of the above financial records, DVs, 
together with their supporting documents, and reports, prevented the Audit Team the 
immediate audit of the financial transactions, so that any irregularities and/or errors 
committed be immediately detected and corrected by Management. 
 



29 
 

Also, the non-submission of the said records and reports caused delay and imposed 
undue constraint on the timely audit of the aforementioned accounts and transactions, 
and completion of the Annual Audit Report (AAR) on the PCAARRD by the Audit Team. 
 
We recommended that the Executive Director: 
 

a. direct the Accountant to immediately submit to the Audit Team the lacking 
DVs and their supporting documents, LRs and RCDs as presented in 
Annex A; and 

b. direct the Director for Finance and Administrative Division (FAD) and the 
Accountant in ensuring that all DVs and financial reports are submitted to 
the Audit Team within the prescribed period, to facilitate timely audit of the 
accounts and transactions of the PCAARRD, pursuant to Section 7.2.1 of 
the RRSA prescribed under COA Circular No. 2009-006 and Section 60, 
Chapter 19 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. Otherwise, initiate appropriate 
action against the concerned personnel, in accordance with Section 122(2) 
of PD No. 1445, if warranted. 

 
Management’s Comments: 
 
The Accountant will immediately submit the lacking DVs and their supporting 
documents, LRs and RCDs to the Audit Team. 
 
The Office of the Executive Director will also issue an administrative order to 
immediately implement the audit recommendations as stated in the Audit Observation 
Memorandum (AOM). 
 
The FAD Director and the Accountant will make sure that all DVs and financial reports 
will be submitted to the Audit Team within ten days after the end of each month/quarter. 
 

2. The PCAARRD’s assertions on the validity and reliability of the Due from National 
Government Agencies (NGAs), Local Government Units (LGUs), and Non-
Government Organizations/People’s Organizations (NGOs/POs) account balances 
amounting to P2,476,909,778.19, P7,119,206.00 and P73,165,410.32, respectively, 
were doubtful due to: (a) reported discrepancies of P50,113,362.48 between book 
balance with the confirmed balances from 11 Implementing Agencies (IAs);         
(b) erroneous posting/recording of fund releases and liquidations/refund; and      
(c) outstanding balance of P1.827 billion remain unliquidated despite completion 
of the project duration, thereby affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in 
the Financial Statements. This is contrary to Sections 6.5 and 5.4 of Commission 
on Audit (COA) Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2007-001, respectively. 
 
COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994, is applicable in the financial 
transactions of National Government and instrumentalities involving grant, utilization and 
liquidation of funds transferred to implementing agencies.  Thus, one of the duties and 
responsibilities of the implementing agencies is to submit liquidation reports within the 
prescribed period, to wit: 
 

“6.5 within ten (10) days after receipt from the AO, the Accountant shall 
verify the Reports, provide accounting entries, record and submit the 



30 
 

duplicate copies of the Reports with all the originals of vouchers/payrolls 
and all supporting documents to the IA Auditor. The Accountant shall 
ensure that only expenses for the project are included in the Reports.  He 
shall submit the original copy of the Reports to the Source Agency (SA) 
(Attention: The SA Accountant).” 

 
Section 5.4 of COA Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007, requires agencies to 
submit the final fund utilization report within 60 days after the completion of a project 
certified by its Accountant and approved by its President/Chairman to the Government 
Organizations (GOs), together with the inspection report and certificate of project 
completion rendered by the GOs authorized representative, list of beneficiaries with their 
acceptance/acknowledgement of the project/funds/goods/services received. The validity 
of these documents shall be verified by the internal auditor of equivalent official of the 
GOs and shall be the basis of the GOs in recording the fund utilization in its books of 
accounts. These documents shall support the liquidation of funds granted to the 
NGOs/POs. 
 
Item 3.c, Section VIII of Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Administrative 
Order (AO) No. 009, series of 2017, on the Submission of Financial Reports (FRs), 
provide the following guidelines: 
 

“i.   For monitoring purposes, the Implementing Agency shall submit to the 
Monitoring Agency a FR certified correct by the agency accountant 
within a month after each semester. If applicable, as deemed by the 
monitoring agency, the following requirement shall be submitted: 

 
i.1  DOST Form H-Semi Annual/Annual FR; 
i.2  DOST Form K-List of Equipment Purchased 
i.3  DOST Form L –Schedule of Accounts Payable; and 
i.4  DOST Form M-Report of Income/Interest Generated/Earned 

 
The FRs shall be itemized in accordance with the approved LIB. 

 
ii. For program/project for multi-year duration, the Project Leader shall 

submit FR for grants received, duly noted by the Head of the Agency 
or its authorized representative and certified by the agency 
accountant within two (2) months after the end of each year of 
implementation. For NGOs or privately owned institutions, annual 
Audited Financial Report (AFR) shall be submitted certified by a 
licensed independent accountant together with an Audit 
Certificate/Report. 

 
For projects with CO, the FR shall be supported by DOST Form K-List 
of Equipment Purchased and PAR. 

 
iii. A Terminal AFR (DOST Form No. I) shall be submitted to the 

Monitoring Agency within three (3) months after the completion of the 
project.  The Monitoring Agency shall submit the audited FR not later 
than one month after receipt from the Implementing Agency. For 
NGOs or privately owned institutions, an audited FS shall be 



31 
 

submitted duly certified by a licensed accountant together with the 
Audit Certificate/Report.” 

 
Item 3.d.5, Section VIII of the same Order on the Unexpended Balance (UB) and 
Savings/Interest/Income provides that “Upon project completion/termination, all 
balances/savings and income/interests earned shall be reported and reverted to 
Funding Agency within three (3) months after the end of project period.” 
 
On the other hand, Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) 
for NGAs, Volume I provides: 

 
“Section 15. Fair Presentation. The FSs shall present fairly the financial 
position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair 
presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of 
transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the 
definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and 
expenses set out in PPSAS.  The application of PPSAS, with appropriate 
disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair presentation of the FS.” 

 
The reported balances of Due from NGAs, LGUs, and NGOs/POs accounts in the 
Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020, are as follows: 

 

Account  Amount 

Due from National Government Agencies (NGAs) P 2,476,909,778.19  

Due from Local Government Units (LGUs) 7,119,206.00  

Due from Non-Government Organizations 
(NGOs)/People's Organizations (POs) 

73,165,410.32  

      Total P 2,557,194,394.51  

 
Audit of the above accounts disclosed some deficiencies which were already discussed 
in the previous years’ Annual Audit Reports (AARs), to wit: 
 

a) variance between book balance and confirmed balances of the IAs amounting 
to P50,113,362.48 

 
Confirmation letters were sent to 35 IAs to validate the reported Subsidiary Ledgers (SL) 
balances with the IAs book balances. Of which, 11 replied and confirmed their balances 
showing a variance of P50,113,362.48, as shown below:

Five IAs have submitted the confirmations, together with the latest audited Financial 
Reports (FRs) amounting to P15,224,503.50, however, these are not yet taken-up in the 
books as of December 31, 2020. Further examination of the respective SLs revealed 
that the liquidation/refund of fund transfers with Audited FRs of P9,620,030.15 (Annex 
B) for seven projects were still not reflected in the SLs as of reporting date. 
 
During the preparation of the confirmation letters, it was noted that the complete Project 
Titles were not presented and available in the e-NGAS due to their character limitations. 
The Audit Team requested for assistance with the Project Financial Management 
Liquidation Unit (PFMLU) which was created to monitor liquidations of these accounts. It 
was, however, revealed that they did not maintain a database with details such as 
project titles, date granted and due date of liquidation, assigned Project Manager/Project 
Leader, status of projects, research outputs, Submission of Financial Reports, balances 
for refund/refunded, balances for reconciliation of the Accounting Section and Demand 
Letters sent, among others, together with the copy of Memorandum of Agreement 
entered between the Implementing Agency and the PCAARRD. This is a monitoring 
mechanism to establish accountability, track down progress/status of project 
implementation, monitor the liquidations/refund made by the concerned IAs and identify 
accounts for reconciliation/adjustment of the Accounting Section. Also, this will aid in the 
immediate preparation and facilitation of demand letters and confirmation letters. 
 
A regular monitoring and reconciliation of receivable balances with the IAs must be 
employed in order to ensure timely submission of liquidation reports and immediate 
detection and correction of any noted discrepancies, in accordance with COA Circular 
Nos. 94-013 and 2007-001, respectively. 
 
 



33 
 

We recommended that the Executive Director instruct the Accountant to: 
 

a. verify the noted variance amounting to P50,113,362.48 per confirmation, in 
coordination with the assigned Project Manager/Project Leader, and 
communicate with the Accountants of the concerned IAs for the immediate 
submission of the FRs; 

 
b. reconcile the discrepancy noted as the result of coordination with the 

Project Leader and the IAs, make the necessary adjustments and submit 
the reconciliation of balances of the 42 projects to the Audit Team, for 
assessment; and 
 

c. work closely with the Project Financial Management Liquidation Unit to 
create and maintain a database to facilitate monitoring and reconciliation of 
the recorded fund transfers to various IAs. 

 
Management’s Comments: 
 
The Executive Director will direct the Accountant to: 
 

a. verify the noted variance amounting to P50,113,362.48 per confirmation, in 
coordination with the assigned Project Leader, and communicate with the 
Accountants of the concerned IAs for the immediate submission of the FRs; 

 
b. reconcile the discrepancy noted as the result of coordination with the Project 

Leader and the IAs, make the necessary adjustments and submit  the 
reconciliation of balances of the 42 projects to the Audit Team, for assessment; 
and 

 
c. work closely with the PFMLU and request the system owner of PALIHAN 

(database for GIA projects) to grant the PFMLU an access to the database to 
facilitate monitoring and reconciliation of the recorded fund transfers to various 
IAs. 

 
b) errors in the posting/recording of fund releases and liquidations/refund 
 
Examination of the SLs showed that the account Municipal Treasurer of Los Baños with 
account code 10303010-00-242-002 amounting to P1,493,054.50 for the project 
“Enhancing Gender-Sensitive S&T Based Tilapia Cage Culture for Low-Income Fish-
farmers in Selected Barangays” was erroneously recorded under Due from NGAs 
account instead of Due from LGUs account. 
 
It was noted that the refund of unexpended balance of the Philippine Coconut Authority 
(PCA) for the project “Reinvigorating the Philippine Coconut Industry through the CICY 
Coconut Somatic Embryogenesis Technology” with account code 10303010-00-205-008 
amounting to P220,165.38 per Official Receipt (OR) No. 2640957 was inappropriately 
posted to account code 10303010-00-205-016, thus misstating the affected accounts as 
of year-end.  
 
Moreover, 21 accounts of completed projects under Due from NGAs fall below 
P1,000.00 and outstanding for 1 to 23 years (Annex C). The existence of these small 



34 
 

balances can possibly be the accumulated accounting errors for verification and 
reconciliation of the Accounting Section. Errors made in the recording of transactions 
may result in unreconciled balances if not immediately verified and corrected. It is 
notable that the SL balances of PCA were already adjusted the following year. 
 
We recommended that the Executive Director instruct the Accountant to prepare 
journal entry to reclassify the Municipal Treasurer account to Due from LGUs 
account, and to ensure that the SLs and journal entry vouchers be reviewed 
thoroughly prior to posting of transactions in the SL to avoid accumulation of 
errors in the future transactions. 
 
Management’s Comments:  
 
The Executive Director will also instruct the Accountant to prepare journal entry to 
reclassify the Municipal Treasurer account to Due from LGUs account, and to ensure 
that the SLs and journal entry vouchers be reviewed thoroughly prior to posting of 
transactions in the SL to avoid accumulation of errors in the future transactions. 
 
c) outstanding balance of P1.827 billion remained unliquidated despite 

completion of the project duration 
 
Overdue accounts of GIA funds transferred to various IAs in the amount of 
P1,768,162,130.55, P7,119,206.00 and P51,937,294.37 under Due from NGAs, LGUs 
and NGOs/POs accounts, respectively, remained unliquidated, and the unexpended 
balances, if any, were not yet refunded despite completed contract duration. The aging 
schedule of past due accounts, is summarized below:

Analysis of records revealed that past due accounts totaling P1.827 billion as of 
December 31, 2020, increased by P362.593 million or 24.75 percent when compared to 
the previous year’s unliquidated fund releases of P1.465 billion. 

 
It was noted that dormant accounts of Due from NGAs in the amount of P18.168 million 
have been inactive for 10 years (Annex D). Moreover, the non-moving unliquidated 
accounts under Due from NGOs/POs totaling P3,173,767.63 of the former Philippine 
Council for Aquatic and Marine Research and Development (PCAMRD) before its 
consolidation with the PCAARRD in 2011 were not yet settled despite the noted audit 
observation for two consecutive years, as shown on the next page.

Notwithstanding the accumulation of the unliquidated balance of Due from NGAs and 
NGOs account and as reiterated in previous AAR, the PCAARRD still has released 
funds to the IAs of various NGAs and NGOs with unliquidated fund transfers of 
completed projects of P1,177 billion, as follows:

Total P 1,177,833,182.43 133 P 365,782,360.93 

 
The funds released for the implementation of the new projects of Due from NGAs and 
NGOs account totaling P365.782 million significantly increased by 114.98 percent as 
compared during calendar year (CY) 2019 of P170.145 million with 111 projects. The 
lists of fund transfers to IAs with unliquidated balance for the said completed projects are 
shown in (Annexes E and F). 
 
The above practice is not in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-002 dated May 31, 
2016, which provides that no subsequent releases shall be granted unless the previous 
funds transferred to IAs are properly accounted for, to avoid accumulation of 
unliquidated balances. In addition, it was observed that the Accountant did not strictly 
comply with the issuance of a certification that the previous grants to the IAs have been 
fully liquidated as required in said Circular.  
 
Management consistently followed the instruction of the Executive Director to implement 
the procedures under PCAARRD AO No. 245 dated October 22, 2018, in processing the 



36 
 

Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) of fund transfers for newly-approved Grant-in-Aid (GIA) 
projects effective immediately: 
 

“a. Process DVs of fund transfer for new projects to agency department 
without outstanding financial obligations or unliquidated transferred 
funds for completed project from PCAARRD; 

 
b. xxx 
 
c. Prepare a certification that previously released funds for completed 

projects of the agency department concerned have been liquidated 
and taken up in the books; and 

 
d. For agency department that has not yet received any fund transfer 

from PCAARRD, prepare a certification stating the said status.” 
 
Further, the continuous inclusion of the unliquidated balances in the books showed the 
laxity of Management in monitoring project implementation. The absence of 
liquidations/technical reports and/or remittance of any remaining funds by the IAs upon 
the completion of the project, may hinder the attainment of the objective to translate the 
funds transferred into research outputs/deliverables. 
 
We reiterated our audit recommendations that the Executive Director instruct the 
Accountant to: 
 

a. revisit all completed projects with outstanding balances, and coordinate 
with the Project Managers/Project Leaders and IAs for the immediate 
submission of liquidation reports, and refund of any unexpended balances, 
pursuant to COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 and Section 
3(c and d) of DOST AO No. 009, series of 2017; 

 
b. issue “Certification by the Accountant that funds previously transferred to 

the Implementing Agency (lA) has been liquidated and accounted for in the 
books” prior to granting of subsequent releases and consider stopping the 
processing of DV for fund transfer involving new projects to the IAs with 
significant unliquidated balances for completed projects, pursuant to COA 
Circular No. 2016-002; and 

 
c. exhaust all legal remedies to compel the concerned IAs and NGOs/POs to 

submit liquidation documents, in accordance with Sections 6.5 and 5.4 of 
COA Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2007-001, respectively, particularly for those 
that have been dormant for 10 years and above.  

 
Management’s Comments: 
 
The Executive Director will instruct the Accountant to: 
 

a. revisit all completed projects with outstanding balances, and coordinate with the 
Project Managers/Project Leaders and IAs for the immediate submission of 
liquidation reports, and refund of any unexpended balances, pursuant to COA 



37 
 

Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 and Section 3(c and d) of DOST 
AO No. 009, series of 2017; 

 
b. issue a certification by the Accountant that funds previously transferred to the lA 

has been liquidated and accounted for in the books prior to granting of 
subsequent releases. 

 
However, to allow consideration on the substance of the projects proposed to 
and approved by the PCAARRD, Management currently allows releases of funds 
to specific smallest units of the IAs with no outstanding/unliquidated balances in 
the PCAARRD’s books, pursuant to DOST Resolution No. 2018-1. Nonetheless, 
Management will consider stopping the processing of DV for fund transfer 
involving new projects to the IAs with significant unliquidated balances for 
completed projects, pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-002; and 

 
c. exhaust all legal remedies to compel concerned IAs and NGOs/POs to submit 

liquidation documents in accordance with Sections 6.5 and 5.4 of COA Circular 
Nos. 94-013 and 2007-001, respectively, particularly for those that have been 
dormant for 10 years and above. 
 

3. The Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) account’s balance as of December 31, 
2020, of P202,789,057.98 (gross) is of doubtful validity and reliability due to the: (a)  
difference of P2,641,895.67 between the General Ledger balance and the Report 
on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE); (b) absence of 
Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) on derecognized PPE items accounted as semi-
expendable properties; (c) under/non-provision of depreciation on Technical and 
Scientific Equipment and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) 
Equipment accounts; and (d) non-disposal of four unserviceable motor vehicles 
amounting to P1,899,708.30, thus affecting the fair presentation of the PPE and 
other related accounts in the financial statements. 
 
Section 38, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides: 
 

“Physical Count of PPE. The entity shall have a periodic physical count of 
PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the Report on the 
Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 
71) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the 
Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. 
Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical 
count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper 
accounting/recording.” 

 
Likewise, the Handbook on Property and Supply Management System further 
prescribes: 
 

“After the physical inventory taking, the Inventory Committee shall reconcile 
the results of the count with the property and accounting records. xxx the 
inventory listing of the equipment shall be compared with the property card 
maintained by the property/supply officer as against the equipment ledger 
cards maintained by the accounting and the total thereof shall be reconciled 
with the control accounts in the general ledger. xxx. All discrepancies 



38 
 

between the physical and book inventories must be investigated, cleared and 
reconciled immediately. If necessary, written explanation shall be required 
from accountable and responsible person.”  

 
The above provisions emphasizes that physical inventory-taking is an indispensable 
procedure for checking the validity, existence and correctness of reported balances of 
assets, as well as integrity of property custodianship. Reconciling the records of the 
Accountant against the actual inventory count, as well as validating the Property 
Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) issued to end-users, are all basic procedures to 
implement the effective internal control for PPEs. 
 
Moreover, Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020, 
prescribes the guidelines and procedures on inventory-taking, recognition of those found 
at station and disposition for non-existing/missing PPE items for the one-time cleansing 
of PPE accounts of government agencies, to establish PPE balances that are verifiable 
as to existence, condition and accountability. 
 
a) there was a difference of P2,641,895.67 between the General Ledger (GL) 

balance and the RPCPPE; 
 

The Calendar Year (CY) 2020 Statement of Financial Position reflected a total PPE 
account balance (gross) of P202,789,057.98. Comparison of the GL balances and the 
balances per Inventory for each type of PPE is shown in the table below:

Total P202,789,057.98  P200,147,162.31  P2,641,895.67  

 
As can be viewed from the preceding above, the total balance per GL compared with the 
Inventory Report showed a net variance of P2,641,895.67. The Accounting and Property 
Sections did not reconcile their records of PPE accounts despite prior year’s audit 
observations and recommendations relative thereto, contrary to the aforementioned 
provisions. 
 
Verification of the PPE accounts and records disclosed the following factors which have 
caused the noted variances: 
 



39 
 

1. The difference in the amount presented in the GL and the reported amount in the 
RPCPPE under Buildings, Other Structures and ICT Equipment accounts of 
P1,244,892.44, P814,425.62 and P1,954.88, respectively, was due to the 
unreconciled records maintained by the Accounting and Property Sections of the 
following identified five PPE items:

2. One unserviceable motor vehicle described as 1994 Mitsubishi Galant Supersaloon 

(Allegro Green) with Plate No. SHZ-629 and Property No. D-101-2006-878-084 
amounting to P134,183.18 was already disposed and sold. The derecognition of the 
said vehicle was taken-up in the books per Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) No. 2020-
09-3904 dated September 24, 2020. However, the same vehicle was still included in 
the physical count and reported in the RPCPPE at year-end. This was clearly the 
cause of the discrepancy of P134,183.18 which can be easily identified if 
reconciliation was made after the physical count. 
 

3. Three items of furniture and fixtures found at the station of Management Information 
Systems Division (MISD), Office of the Executive Director-Administration, Resource 
Management and Support Services (OED-ARMSS) and Finance and Administrative 
Division-General Services and Records Section (FAD-GSS) and included in the 
RPCPPE amounting to P348,893.40 were not recorded in the books of accounts, as

On the other hand, the Wooden slippers/shoe racks as COVID-19 countermeasures 
acquired in September 9, 2020, amounting to P227,360.00 and recorded under 
Furniture and Fixtures account was not included in the physical count and the 
RPCPPE. 
 

4. No RPCPPE was prepared for the Book account amounting to P30,000.00. Review 
of the PPE schedule disclosed that this book McGraw Hill Encyclopedia of Science 
and Technology 8th Edition, McGraw Hill 1997 (20 volumes) was acquired on March 
10, 2003. Although this item was fully depreciated, it should still be included in the 
physical count to determine its existence. 
 

Furthermore, the following are the other deficiencies noted by the Audit Team: 
 

 The Prepaid Insurance account amounting to P462,264.00 was erroneously 
included in the submitted RPCPPE as of December 31, 2020. 

 

 The RPCPPE for the Other Land Improvements, Buildings and Other Structures 
accounts were not properly accomplished since the details for columns Article, 
Unit of Measure, Quantity per Property Card and per Physical Count, 
Shortage/Overage and Remarks were not provided. 
 

The Property Officer had explained that another contributing factor for the discrepancy 
was the disposal and sale of unserviceable PPE items in prior years. However, no report 
was forwarded to the Accounting Section, thus the immediate derecognition of the same 
was not effected. The guidelines in reconciliation of records and verification of these 
undocumented disposals were provided in COA Circular No. 2020-006. This Circular 
prescribes the procedures on inventory-taking, recognition of those found at station and 
disposition for non-existing/missing PPE items for the one-time cleansing of PPE 
accounts to come up with reliable PPE balance that are verifiable as to existence, 
condition and accountability. 

 
The foregoing conditions and the net discrepancy of P2,641,895.67 between the books 
and the RPCPPE renders the accuracy and reliability of the recorded balance of PPE 
account doubtful. 
 
We recommended that the Executive Director direct: 
 

a. all concerned Divisions to prepare list of existing PPE per office under their 
custody for submission to, and verification of the Property Section, prior to 
the conduct of actual inventory by the Inventory Committee; 
 

b. the Property Section to update their records based on the results of the 
initial inventory, and coordinate with the Accounting Section to reconcile 
the Property Cards with the PPE Ledger Cards (PPELCs); 
 

c. the Accounting Section to take-up necessary journal entries to recognize 
PPEs found at station, including the unrecorded Furniture and Fixtures 
amounting to P348,893.00, and prepare/maintain the corresponding 
PPELCs; 

 
 



41 
 

d. the Inventory Committee to: 
 

 conduct physical count of all the PPE, whether acquired through 
purchase or donation, and prepare and submit the RPCPPE, in 
compliance with Section 38, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I;  

 

 ensure that full reconciliation of the inventory count documented in 
RPCPPE with the records maintained by the Accounting Section is 
properly made, to establish the correct balance of PPE; and 

 

 strictly comply with the guidelines and procedures on inventory-taking, 
recognition of those found at station and disposition for non-
existing/missing PPE items for the one-time cleansing of PPE accounts 
of the PCAARRD, in accordance with COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated 
January 31, 2020; and 

 
e. the Property and Accounting Sections to perform periodic reconciliation of 

their records to ensure that all discrepancies are immediately investigated, 
cleared and reconciled.  

 
Management’s Comments:  
 
The Executive Director will issue an Administrative Order directing: 
 

a. all concerned Divisions to prepare and submit a list of existing PPE under the 
custody of each office, subject to verification of Property Section, prior to the 
execution of actual inventory count by the Inventory Committee; 

 
b. the Property Section to ensure updating of its records based on the results of the 

actual count, and to work with the Accounting Section to reconcile its maintained 
Property Cards with the PPE Ledger Cards (PPELCS) of the latter; 

 
c. the Accounting Section to prepare a journal entry for the recognition of PPEs 

found at station and prepare the corresponding PPELCS; 
 
d. the Inventory Committee to: 

 

 conduct physical count of all the PPE, regardless of acquisition mode, and 
prepare and submit the corresponding RPCPPE; 

 

 ensure that the data recorded in RPCPPE tally with the records maintained 
by the Accounting Section to establish the correct balance of PPE; and 

 

 strictly comply with COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020, on 
the guidelines and procedures on inventory-taking, recognition of those found 
at station and disposition for non-existing/missing PPE items for the onetime 
cleansing of PPE accounts of the Agency; and 

 
e. the Property and Accounting Sections to regularly reconcile their records to 

ensure that all discrepancies will be dealt with promptly. 



42 
 

b) absence of ICS on derecognized PPE items accounted as semi-expendable 
properties; 

 
Item 5.4 of COA Circular No. 2016-006 dated December 29, 2016, provides: 
 

“Tangible items below the capitalization threshold of P15,000 shall be 
accounted as semi-expendable property. The following policies shall be 
applied as follows:  
 
5.4.1 Semi-expendable property which were recognized as PPE shall be 

reclassified to the affected appropriate semi-expendable inventory 
accounts (if not yet issued to end-user), expense accounts (if issued 
within the year), or accumulated surplus/(deficit)/retained earnings 
accounts (if issued in prior years).  

 
5.4.2 These tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon issue 

to the end-user.  
 
5.4.3 Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) shall be issued to end-user to 

establish accountability over the semi-expendable property. 
Accountability shall be extinguished upon return of the item to the 
Property and Supply Division/Unit or in case of loss, upon approval 
of the relief from property accountability.” 

 
Review of the General Journal revealed that JEVs to recognize semi-expendable 
properties and adjust PPE items amounting to P1,458,131.00 were made without the 
ICS issued to end-user to establish accountability over the semi-expendable property, to 
wit:

We recommended that the Executive Director direct the Property Officer to issue 
the ICS to the end-users of those semi-expendable items to monitor and pinpoint 
accountability, copy furnished the Accounting Section, and submit the same to 
the Audit Team for verification. 
 
Management’s Comments:  
 
The Executive Director will also issue an order to the Property Officer on the issuance of 
ICS to the end-users of semi-expendable items, copy furnished the Accounting Section, 
and to be submitted to the Audit Team. 

 
c) under/non-provision of depreciation of Technical and Scientific Equipment and 

ICT Equipment; 
 

Section 27, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides: 
 

“e. The straight line method of depreciation shall be adopted unless 
another method is more appropriate for entity operation. That method 
is applied consistently from period to period unless there is a change 
in the expected pattern of consumption of those future economic 
benefits or service potential. Xxx 

 
xxx 

 
i. A residual value equivalent to at least five percent (5%) of the cost 

shall be adopted unless a more appropriate percentage is determined 
by the entity based on its operation subject to the approval of COA.” 

 
Four Technical and Scientific Equipment amounting to P95,200.00 acquired on 
November 19, 2019, with 10 years useful life was recorded in the books on December 
29, 2020, only. However, the recorded depreciation was only for one month and no 
depreciation was taken up for CY 2020, as presented below:

It was also noted in the review of the PPE schedule under ICT Equipment account, an 
inclusion of a particular ICT Equipment and Peripherals under contract 08-2019 dated

the useful life of the PPE items were not indicated, thus no depreciation was provided 
since its acquisition.  
 
The under/non-provision of depreciation resulted in the overstatement of the 
Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account and understatement of Accumulated Depreciation 
– Technical and Scientific Equipment and ICT Equipment and Depreciation Expenses 
accounts as reflected in the Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Financial 
Performance 
 
We recommended that the Executive Director instruct the Accountant to compute 
the depreciation of the said Technical and Scientific Equipment and ICT 
Equipment based on the estimated useful life of the asset, and make the 
necessary adjustment in the books based on the computation, in accordance with 
Items e and i, Section 27, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I.  
 
Management’s Comments:  
 
The Executive Director will instruct the Accountant to compute the depreciation of the 
identified items of Equipment with no recorded depreciation to effect the necessary 
adjustment in the books, in accordance with Section 27, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, 
Volume l. 
 
d) failure to dispose four unserviceable motor vehicles amounting to 

P1,899,708.30, contrary to Sections 63 and 64 of the Manual on the New 
Government Accounting System (MNGAS), Volume II, thereby resulting in  
further deterioration and reduction of their salvage value due to continuous 
exposure to natural elements, hence lessening their saleable value. 
 

Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government 
Auditing Code of the Philippines, provides: 
 

“When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or 
is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable 
therefor, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized 
representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to 
be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found 
to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under 
the supervision of the proper committee an award or similar body in the 
presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative 
of the Commission.” 



45 
 

Furthermore, Section 40(d), Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that“ All 
unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of 
Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74).  PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be 
dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment 
(cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation).” 

 
Review of the submitted RPCPPE showed that the following motor vehicles amounting 
to P1,899,708.30 were already unserviceable but remained undisposed, contrary to 
Section 79 of PD No. 1445:

Total P1,899,708.30  

 
Among the previous year's audit observations was the non-preparation of the Inventory 
and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) for identified unserviceable 
motor vehicles in the RPCPPE and non-disposal thereof.  It was worth mentioning that 
the disposal of one motor vehicle was completed in February 2020, as previously 
recommended. 
 
According to the Disposal Management Team and the Property Section, the documents 
for the disposal of these four vehicles were already completed, but the IIRUP was 
returned from the Office of the Executive Director for re-appraisal. The delay in its 
disposal would subject these properties to further deterioration and lessen their potential 
saleable price. 

 
We recommended that the Executive Director direct the Disposal Management 
Team to conduct the re-appraisal of all unserviceable properties, and cause the 
disposal of the same as soon as possible to prevent further deterioration, and to 
get the higher saleable price for the unserviceable motor vehicles. 
 
Management’s Comments:  
 
The Executive Director will also direct the Disposal Management Team to conduct the 
reappraisal of all unserviceable properties, and cause the disposal of the same as soon 
as possible to prevent further deterioration, and to get the higher saleable price for the 
unserviceable motor vehicles. 
 

4. No amortization for calendar year (CY) 2020 was recognized on Intangible Assets-
Computer Software account amounting to P563,441.29, thereby understating the 
Amortization-Intangible Assets, Computer Software and the Accumulated 
Amortization-Computer Software accounts and overstatement of Intangible 
Assets as of year-end. This is contrary to Section 9, Chapter 12 of the Government 



46 
 

Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I 
and Annex A of Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 
8, 2020, which contain the lists and descriptions of all accounts in the Revised 
Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019). 
 
Annex A of COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 is the Revised Chart of 
Accounts (Updated 2019) of GAM for NGAs, which defines Intangible Assets-Computer 
Software as account used to recognize the purchase cost or capitalized development 
cost of computer software programs for use in government operation, when the software 
is not integral part of the related hardware. Development costs include cost of coding, 
testing and cost to produce product masters. Accumulated Amortization-Computer 
Software is the account credited for the allocation of cost of computer software in 
accordance with the prescribed policy on amortization. 

 
Intangible Assets are carried at its cost less any accumulated amortization and any 
accumulated impairment losses. 

 
Section 9, Chapter 12 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that an intangible asset with 
a finite useful life is amortized on a straight line method. It prescribes the manner of 
systematic allocation over the useful life of the assets, with amortization commencing 
when the asset is available for use, and ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is 
classified as held for sale. 
 
The recorded amount of the Intangible Assets-Computer Software account presented in 
the Statement of Financial Position is P563,441.29 as of December 31, 2020. The said 
account pertains to the purchase cost of 29 pieces of Microsoft Office software at 
P19,429.01 each, which were acquired in June 2020 and installed in various computers 
of the Agency. 
 
However, it was observed that no amortization was recognized for CY 2020, thereby 
understating the current year’s Amortization-Intangible Assets, Computer Software and 
the Accumulated Amortization-Computer Software accounts. Upon inquiry, no reason 
was provided by the Accountant for failure to generate the corresponding amortization. 

 
The non-recognition of the amortization affected the fair presentation of the related 
accounts in the financial statements of the PCAARRD. 
 
We recommended that the Executive Director instruct the Accountant to: 
 

a. assess the estimated useful life of the Computer Software and compute for 
the amortization for CY 2020, in accordance with the aforementioned 
provisions of GAM for NGAS, Volume I; and  
 

b. prepare the necessary adjusting entry to reflect the accurate balance of 
Intangible Assets and related Accumulated Amortization accounts in the 
books of accounts of the PCAARRD. 

 
 
 
 
 



47 
 

Management’s Comments:  
 
The Accountant was instructed to assess the estimated useful life of the Computer 
Software to provide amortization for the intangible asset, in accordance with the 
provisions of Chapter 12 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 
The Accountant had already prepared the necessary adjusting entry as evidenced by 
Journal Entry Voucher (JEV)-2021-03-001087. 

 
5. The reported balance of Inventory accounts of P10,259,039.14 as of December 31, 

2020, was unreliable due to: (a) non-conduct of physical count on Other Supplies and 
Materials Inventory amounting to P864,412.82 and unreconciled discrepancy of 
P5,262,389.45 between the General Ledger (GL) balance and the Report on the 
Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI)  for Office Supplies Inventory; (b) presence 
of negative balances in the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) and schedule of inventories 
maintained by the Accounting Section; and (c) undetermined status of Semi-
Expendable Properties amounting to P2,693,523.87 due to non-maintenance of 
supplies ledger cards and stocks cards, and failure to prepare and submit the 
Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) and Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) 
to record issuance thereof. 
 
Section 490 of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM), Volume I 
provides that “Physical stock-taking is an indispensable procedure for checking the 
integrity of property custodianship. In all cases, the physical inventory-taking which is 
required semi-annually or annually should be regarded with importance.” 

 
Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government 
Agencies (NGAs), Volume I prescribes the following: 
 

“Sec. 9. Perpetual Inventory Method. Supplies and materials 
purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual 
inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a 
running total for the cost of goods sold in each period. The system 
requires accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand at 
all times through the maintenance of the SLC (Appendix 57) by the 
Accounting Division/Unit and Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) by the 
Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock. Regular 
purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and issues 
thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for supplies and 
materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on emergency 
cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense 
accounts. 

 
Sec. 10. Semi-expendable Property. Tangible items below the 
capitalization threshold of P15,000 shall be accounted as semi-
expendable property. The following policies apply as follows: 

 
a. Semi-expendable property which were recognized as PPE shall be 

reclassified to the affected accounts. 
 



48 
 

b. These tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon issue to 
the end-user. 

 
            xxx 
 

Sec. 17. Records, Forms and Reports to be prepared and/or 
maintained. The following records, forms and reports are prescribed for 
use: 

 
             xxx 
 

b. Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) – shall be used to record all receipts 
and issues of supplies and the balance in quantity at any time. It shall 
be maintained by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit for each 
item in stock. The IAR, RIS, PO and DR serve as the original sources 
of information for making entries on the card. 

 
c. Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) (Appendix 57) – shall be used to record 

materials received, issued and the balance both in quantity and 
amount at any time. It shall be maintained by the Accounting 
Division/Unit for each kind of supplies and materials. The IAR, RIS, 
RSMI, PO and DR serve as the original sources of information for 
making entries on the card. 

 
       xxx 
 

g. Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) (Appendix 64) – shall 
be prepared by the Property and/or Supply Custodian based on the 
RIS and shall be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in 
preparing the JEV to record the supplies and materials issued. 

 
xxx 
 
i. Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) (Appendix 66) shall 

be used to report the physical count of supplies by type of inventory as 
at a given date. It shows the balance of inventory items per card and 
per count and shortage/overage, if any. These include the semi-
expendable property wherein the issue is covered by ICS.” 

 
 
Items C, D, and E of the “Instructions” in accomplishing the form provided for in 
Appendix 66 of GAM, Volume II state: 

 
“C. The report shall be reconciled with the SLCs and SCs maintained by 

the Accounting Division/Unit, and Property and/or Supply Division/Unit, 
respectively. Any discrepancy shall be verified and/or adjusted 
accordingly. 

 
D.  The reports shall be prepared in four (4) copies and certified correct by 

the Inventory Committee, approved by the Head of Agency or his/her 
authorized representative, and verified by the COA Auditor. 



49 
 

 
E. The report shall be submitted to the COA Auditor concerned not later 

than July 31 and January 31 of each year for the first and second 
semesters, respectively.” 

 
The calendar year (CY) 2020 balance of the Inventory accounts of P10,259,039.14 is 
broken down and presented below: 
 

Inventory Accounts Amount

   Sub-total 2,693,523.87 

   Total P10,259,039.14 

 
The following deficiencies were noted in the examination of records which affected the 
fair presentation of the Inventory account in the Statement of Financial Position: 
 
Inventory Held for Consumption 
 
a. The Inventory Committee failed to conduct the physical count at year-end on Other 

Supplies and Materials Inventory amounting to P864,412.82. Similar to previous 
year, only the RPCI for Office Supplies Inventory was prepared and belatedly 
submitted on April 13, 2021, instead of January 31, 2021, as provided for in Item E of 
Appendix 66 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II. 

 
Comparison of the balances of Office Supplies Inventory presented in the GL and the 
RPCI amounting to P6,701,102.45 and P1,438,713.00, respectively, showed a 
material discrepancy of P5,262,389.45. This is also a reiteration of prior year’s audit 
observation in which presented an increase of P2,135,169.89 from previous year’s 
discrepancy, as follows:

Review of the General Journal for CY 2020 revealed that only the following Journal 
Entry Vouchers (JEVs) amounting to P359,909.63 were drawn by the Accounting

Total   P359,909.63  

 
Inquiry with the Property Officer who assumed the position in CY 2020 revealed that 
although there were various issuances of office supplies inventory in CY 2020, they 
failed to submit to the Accounting Section the RSMI based on the Requisition and 
Issue Slip (RIS). In effect, the Accounting Section has no basis in preparing the JEV 
to record the supplies and materials issued.  
 
A material discrepancy of P5,262,389.45 as of December 31, 2020, may be the 
result of non-submission of the Property Section of the RSMI for the months of 
March to December 2020 and even in prior years. This can be confirmed had 
reconciliation of records of the Supply and Accounting Sections were made regularly. 
 

b. Negative balances of 776 items of Office Supplies Inventory and Other Supplies and 
Materials Inventory accounts remained unreconciled and unadjusted despite the 
prior year’s audit observations. 
 
Verification of the Subsidiary Ledgers and detailed Inventory Schedule maintained by 
the Accounting Section showed that Office Supplies Inventory and Other Supplies 
and Materials Inventory accounts amounting to P67,049.99 and P53,811.50, 
respectively (Annex G) still have negative balances. This is an indication that prior 
years’ errors in the recording of purchases and issuances of supplies were not yet 
reviewed and verified by the Accounting and Property Sections. 

 
Semi-Expendable Properties 
 
c. The status of the Semi-Expendable Properties could not be determined due to the 

non-maintenance of the Supplies Ledger Card and Stock Cards, and failure to 
prepare and submit the RSMI and ICS to record issuance thereof. 
 



51 
 

Inquiry revealed that the Accounting and Property Sections did not maintain the 
required Supplies Ledger Card and Stock Cards, respectively, for the Semi-
Expendable Properties amounting to P2,693,523.87. Thus, there are no available 
records to identify the breakdown or composition of the recorded balance, in violation 
of Sections 17.b and 17.c, Chapter 8 of GAM for NGAS, Volume I .  
 
Audit also revealed that the Inventory Committee was unable to conduct the physical 
count and prepared an RPCI of the semi-expendable inventories since all items were 
issued to the end-users as of year-end. However, the Property Section failed to 
prepare and submit the corresponding RSMI and ICS. Thus, no journal entry was 
made by the Accounting Section to recognize as expense upon its issuances to the 
end-users.  
 

In view of the foregoing, the accuracy and reliability of these Inventory accounts 
amounting to P10,259,039.14 as presented in the financial statements could not be 
ascertained. 

 
We recommended that the Executive Director: 

 
a. direct the Inventory Committee to include all unissued Inventories in the 

actual physical count, and prepare and submit the RPCI thereon not later 
than July 31 and January 31 of each year for the first and second 
semesters, respectively; 
 

b. instruct the Accounting and Property Sections to prepare and maintain the 
Supplies Ledger Cards and the Stock Cards in the e-NGAS and the 
PCAARRD Procurement and Inventory Monitoring System (PPIMS), 
respectively, to recognize the receipt and issuances of all inventories, and 
conduct periodic reconciliation of their respective records; 

 
c. direct the Property Section to prepare and submit the RSMI based on RIS 

and ICS to the Accounting Section, as basis in preparing the JEV to record 
the supplies and materials issued for the month; 
 

d. direct the Accounting and Property Sections to trace and reconcile the 
noted material discrepancy of P5,262,389.45, and make necessary 
adjusting entries duly supported with proper schedules and documents; 
and 
 

e. direct the Accounting Section to reconcile the subsidiary ledger balances 
and schedule of inventories, and work back on pertinent records to 
establish the cause of negative balances and effect the necessary 
adjustments to correct the errors, and  henceforth, exercise due diligence 
in making  journal  entries. 

 
Management’s Comments:  
 
The Executive Director committed to: 
 



52 
 

a. order the Inventory Committee to ensure that all unissued inventories will be 
included in the actual physical count, and that the corresponding RPCI be 
submitted on or before the deadline for such report; 

 
b. instruct the Accounting and Property Sections to account for the receipts and 

issuances of all inventories through preparation and maintenance of Supplies 
Ledger Cards and Stock Cards in the eNGAs and the PPIMS, respectively, and 
perform regular reconciliation of records; 

 
c. direct the Property Section to prepare and submit to the Accounting Section the 

RSMI that tallies with the RIS and supported with ICS, to serve as the latter’s 
basis in recording the supplies and materials issued on a monthly basis; 

 
d. direct the Accounting and Property Sections to trace and reconcile the noted 

material discrepancy as observed, and draw the necessary adjusting entries duly 
supported with proper schedules and documents; and 

 
e. direct the Accounting Section to reconcile the subsidiary ledger balances and 

schedule of inventories, to locate the cause of negative balances and to adjust 
such items accordingly with due diligence. 

 
6. The Due to National Government Agencies (NGAs) account as of December 31, 

2020 of P3,915,157.74 remain unrefunded and/or unliquidated for less than one 
year to over six years despite completion of the projects, contrary to Sections 6.5 
and 6.7 of Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 
1994, thus exposed the funds to possible misappropriation or misapplication. 
Moreover, due to lack of monitoring of the status of funds, 12 projects showed 
abnormal negative balances of P379,461.66 and unreconciled variance of 
P(1,739,963.53) per confirmation with Technology Application and Promotion 
Institute (TAPI). 
 
Sections 6.5 and 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994, are 
applicable in the financial transactions of National Government and instrumentalities 
involving the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to implementing 
agencies. Thus, one of the duties and responsibilities of the implementing agencies is to 
submit liquidation reports within the prescribed period, to wit: 
 

“6.5 within ten (10) days after receipt from the AO, the Accountant shall 
verify the Reports, provide accounting entries, record and submit the 
duplicate copies of the Reports with all the originals of vouchers/payrolls 
and all supporting documents to the IA Auditor. The Accountant shall 
ensure that only expenses for the project are included in the Reports.  He 
shall submit the original copy of the Reports to the Source Agency (SA) 
(Attention: The SA Accountant). 

 
6.7 return to the SA any unused balance and refund of disallowance upon 
completion of the project.” 

 
Likewise, COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, sets forth the revised 
guidelines and documentary requirements for common government transactions. 



53 
 

Section 3 of the same Circular specifically provides for the documentary requirements on 
the liquidation of fund transfers, as follows: 

 
“3.1.2 Implementation and Liquidation 

 
Implementing Agency: 
 

 Necessary supporting documents depending on the nature of 
transactions 
 

 Copy of MOA/Trust Agreement 
 

 Copy of Official Receipt (OR) upon receipt of funds transferred 
 

 Copy of OR issued by the Source Agency evidencing refund of 
unexpended/unutilized balance of fund transferred” 

 
The Due to NGAs account as of December 31, 2020, disclosed a balance of 
P142,186,927.58 which accounted for 71 percent of the total liabilities of 
P200,588,680.90. The PCAARRD received funds from other NGAs for the 
implementation of various programs, projects and activities which were recorded with 
separate Subsidiary Ledger (SL) each project. Out of the 181 projects with outstanding 
SL balances, 109 projects were still at ongoing implementing status, while 72 projects 
were already completed as of year-end. 
 
Of the 72 projects, 69 projects with Due to NGAs balance of P3,915,157.74 (Annex H) 
were already due for liquidation for less than one year to over 6 years, as summarized 
below.

Verification revealed that the amount of P3,915,157.74 remained unrefunded and/or 
unliquidated to the Source Agency/National Treasury despite completion of the projects, 
in violation of Sections 6.5 and 6.7, and 3.1.2 of COA Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2012-
001, respectively.

Included thereof are the 26 non-moving unliquidated accounts amounting to 
P1,787,948.20 to the former Philippine Council for Aquatic and Marine Research and 
Development (PCAMRD) before its consolidation with the Philippine Council for 
Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCARRD) in 
2011. The specific date of grant and due date of liquidation of 24 projects of PCAMRD 
amounting to P1,654,710.20 were not available. The nine accounts of the Department of 
Science and Technology (DOST) amounting to P772,748.63 were under the same 
circumstances. The immediate settlement of the said balances could not be facilitated 
since specifications on the details such as the exact length of existence of these items in 
the books, detailed purpose and breakdown of project cost and utilization were not 
available. In addition, the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) of these projects as 
required in the liquidation of accounts, has not been produced and located. 
 
Further evaluation of the accounts of the 12 recorded projects showed abnormal

Analysis of records also disclosed variance of (P1,739,963.53) (Annex J) between the 
book balances and confirmation of TAPI accounts amounting to P946,425.38 and 
P2,686,388.91, respectively. Likewise, it was also observed that five projects included in 
the confirmation amounting to P1,072,958.51 were not recorded in the books of 
accounts. 
 
The existence of negative and unreconciled SL balances may indicate erroneous 
recording of transactions and posting of liquidations in the proper SL accounts. This may 
also be due to the non-reconciliation of charges by the bookkeeping and the obligation 
units of the Accounting Section.  
 
Lack of monitoring of the status of funds received from various SAs and project 
implementation resulted in the delayed liquidation and overstatement of the Due to 
NGAs and various expense accounts as of year-end. Failure to refund the unexpended 
balance, if there is any, to the source agencies would expose them to possible 
misappropriation or misapplication. 
 
We recommended that the Executive Director direct the concerned 
Program/Project Leader to coordinate with the Accounting Section to establish 
the status of each project, and to prepare the corresponding Financial/Terminal 
Reports immediately upon completion of the project, and cause the subsequent 
settlement of the unexpended funds received from the source agencies. 
 
We also recommended that the Executive Director instruct the Accountant to: 

 
a. designate a focal person who would be responsible in monitoring the 

status of project implementation of funds received from source agencies, 
in coordination with the Program/Project Leader; 

 



55 
 

b. locate the MOA/Trust Agreements with the source agencies and 
Financial/Terminal Reports, and perform reconciliation with the concerned 
Program/Project Leader to settle the balance of P3,915,157.74 of the 
completed projects; 

 
c. review prior years’ transactions to determine the cause of abnormal 

negative balance of P379,461.66, and prepare the necessary adjustments to 
reflect correct balances of the affected SLs; 
 

d. analyze the Due to PCAMRD accounts and effect the necessary 
adjustments to settle the unliquidated balance, if warranted; and 
 

e. record in the books of accounts the liquidations submitted by the 
Program/Project Leader, submit the Financial/Terminal Reports and refund 
the excess project funds to the source/funding agencies, immediately after 
the completion of the project, in compliance with Sections 6.5 and 6.7 of 
COA Circular No. 94-013. 

 
Management’s Comments:  
 
The Executive Director will direct the concerned monitoring division to communicate with 
the concerned Program/Project Leaders and coordinate with the Accounting Section to 
establish the status of each project, and to prepare the corresponding Financial/ 
Terminal Reports immediately upon completion of the project, and cause the subsequent 
settlement of the unexpended funds received from the source agencies. 
 
The Executive Director will also instruct the Accountant to: 
 

a. Designate a focal person who would be responsible in monitoring the status of 
project implementation of funds received from source agencies, in coordination 
with the Program/Project Leader; 
 

b. Locate the MOA/Trust Agreements with the source agencies and 
Financial/Terminal Reports, and perform reconciliation with the concerned 
Program/Project Leader to settle the balance of P3,915,157.74 of the completed 
projects; 
 

c. review prior year’s transactions to determine the cause of abnormal negative 
balance of P379,461.66, and prepare necessary adjustments to reflect correct 
balances of the affected SLs; 
 

d. analyze the Due to PCAMRD accounts and effect the necessary adjustments to 
settle the unliquidated balance, if warranted; and 
 

e. record in the books of accounts the liquidations submitted by the Program/Project 
Leader, submit the Financial/Terminal Reports and refund the excess project 
funds to the source/funding agencies, immediately after the completion of the 
project, in compliance with Sections 6.5 and 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013.

7. Absence of proper monitoring and reconciliation of accounts resulted in abnormal 
negative balances of Due to Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), Government 
Service Insurance System (GSIS), Pag-IBIG, and PhilHealth subsidiary accounts 
amounting to P2,180,298.25, P245,920.61, P49,066.88 and P8,770.09, and 
unreconciled balances of P320,051.63, P33,267.86, and P70,929.20 and P20,052.62, 
respectively. Thus, fairness of the said accounts in the financial statements 
cannot be relied upon.  
 
Section 124 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 states that “It shall be the direct 
responsibility of the agency head to install, implement, and monitor a sound system of 
internal control.” Also, Section 123 defines that “Internal control as the plan of 
organization and all the coordinate methods and measures adopted within an 
organization or agency to safeguard its assets, check the accuracy and reliability of its 
accounting data, and encourage adherence to prescribed managerial policies.”  

 
The Due to BIR account is used to record the withholding of taxes from 
officers/employees and other entities for remittance to the Bureau of Internal Revenue 
(BIR).  

 
The Due to GSIS, Pag-IBIG, and PhilHealth accounts are used to record the liability for 
collections received or amounts withheld from officers and employees and government 
premium contribution for remittance to the GSIS, Home Development Mutual Funds 
(HDMF), and Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC).   

 
A sound internal control system requires that there should be adequate checking and 
reconciling procedure to produce accurate records. The responsibility for fair 
presentation and reliability of financial statements rests with the management of the 
reporting agency. All financial data should be accurate and reliable.  
 
The Due to BIR, GSIS, Pag-IBIG, and PhilHealth accounts representing taxes and 
contributions withheld from officers and employees, suppliers and contractors as of 
December 31, 2020, reported the following balances:  
 

Inter-Agency Payables Amount 

Due to BIR P 1,648,595.76  

Due to GSIS  33,267.86  

Due to Pag-IBIG  70,929.20  

Due to PhilHealth  20,052.62  

      Total P 1,772,845.44  

 
Review of records disclosed that contributions due for the month of December 2020 
under Due to GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth accounts were remitted on the same 
month. Likewise, taxes withheld under Due to BIR account amounting to P1,328,544.13 
were remitted in January 2021. As a result, unreconciled balances of the accounts were 
noted, as follows:

      Total P 1,772,845.44  P 1,328,544.13 P 444,301.31 

 
Since no Supporting Schedules (SS) of the above accounts were provided by the 
Accounting Section, schedule of Subsidiary Ledgers were exported from the electronic 
New Government Accounting System (e-NGAS). Analysis revealed that various 
subsidiary accounts presented abnormal negative balances (Annexes K to O), as 
summarized below:

Total P 2,928,357.14 745 P (2,484,055.83) P444,301.31 

 
The existence of negative balances may indicate over remittance, error in posting of 
remittances or error in recording late charges as part of remittances. The Accountant 
asserted that the balances of the aforementioned payable accounts are subject for 
reconciliation. 
 
Failure to correct the negative balances and reconcile the records of the subsidiary 
accounts resulted in the unreliable presentation of the balances of Due to BIR, GSIS, 
Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth accounts in the financial statements. 
 
We recommended that the Executive Director direct the Accountant to: 
 

a. trace to prior years’ accounting entries to ascertain the cause of abnormal 
negative balances; 
 

b. review and analyze records pertaining to the unreconciled balances in the 
SLs of the Due to BIR, GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth accounts; and 

 
c. immediately adjust the unreconciled and abnormal account balances to 

correct and update SL balances, and/or refund over remittances, if there 
are any. 

 
Management’s Comments:  
 
The Executive Director will direct the Accountant to: 
 

a. trace prior years' transactions to identify items for adjustment; 
 



58 
 

b. carefully examine the composition of the Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) of the Due to 
BlR, GSIS, Pag-lBlG and PhilHealth accounts to reconcile the records' balances; 
and  

 
c. immediately effect the adjustments that will be identified to rectify the balances of 

the affected accounts, and/or refund over remittances, if there are any. 
 

8. Non-compliance with existing government policies/guidelines in maintaining the 
Petty Cash Fund (PCF) resulted in delayed liquidation of Petty Cash Vouchers 
(PCVs), excessive PCF requirement for one month, and disbursements include 
regular expenses not related to the purpose of the PCF and were not supported 
with complete documentations, contrary to Section 4(6) of Presidential Decree 
(PD) No. 1445, thus exposed the fund to the risk of loss and mishandling.  

  
Section 4(6) of PD No. 1445 states that all claims against government funds shall be 
supported with complete documentation. 

 
Sections 35 and 36, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I provide: 
 
“Sec. 35. Cash Advance for Petty Operating Expenses. The Petty Cash Fund (PCF) 
to be set up shall be sufficient for the recurring petty operating expenses of the agency 
for one month. It shall be maintained using the Imprest System. All replenishments shall 
be directly charged to the expense account and at all times, the PCF shall be equal to 
the total cash on hand and the unreplenished expenses. The PCF shall be replenished 
as soon as disbursements reach at least 75% or as needed. The following are the 
accounting policies regarding cash advance for PCF: 

 
a. The fund shall be kept separately from the regular cash advances/collections and 

shall not be used for payment of regular expenses such as rentals, subscriptions, 
light and water bills, purchase of supplies and materials for stock purposes, and 
the like. Payments out of PCF, which shall be made through a Petty Cash 
Voucher (PCV) (Appendix 48), should be allowed only for amounts not exceeding 
P15,000 for each transaction, except when a higher amount is allowed by law 
and/or specific authority by the COA. Splitting of transactions to avoid exceeding 
the ceiling shall not be allowed. All disbursements out of PCF shall be covered by 
duly accomplished and approved PCV supported by cash invoices, ORs or other 
evidence of disbursements; 

 
Sec. 36. Documentary Requirements. The documentary requirements for PCF as 
provided under COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012, amended by COA 
Circular No. 2013-001 dated January 10, 2013, and under this Chapter, are as follows: 

 
a. Granting of Petty Cash Advance 

 
1. Authority of an accountable officer issued by the Head of the Agency or 

his/her duly authorized representatives indicating the maximum accountability 
and purpose of cash advance (for initial cash advance); 
 

2. Certification from the Accountant that previous cash advances have been 
liquidated and accounted for in the books; and 

 



59 
 

3. Approved application for bond and/or Fidelity Bond for the year for cash 
accountability of P5,001 or more as provided under Treasury Circular No. 02-
2009 dated August 6, 2009. 

 
b. Additional Documentary Requirements for initial cash advances 

 
1. Approved estimates of petty expenses for one month; and 

 
2. Copy of policy for maintaining PCF under the imprest system 

 
c. Liquidation of PCF 

 
1. Report on Paid Petty Cash Vouchers (RPPCV) (Appendix 49); 
2. Approved purchase request with certificate of Emergency Purchase if 

necessary; 
3. Bill, receipts, sales invoices 
4. Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR) (Appendix 62); 
5. Waste Materials Report (WMR) (Appendix 65) in case of replacement/repair; 
6. Approved Trip Ticket, for gasoline/fuel expenses; 
7. Canvass from at least three suppliers for purchases involving P1,000 and 

above, except for purchases made while on official travel; 
8. Summary/Abstract of Canvass; 
9. PCVs duly accomplished and signed; 

10. OR in case of refund; 
11. For reimbursement of toll receipts; and 

i. Toll Receipts 
ii. Trip Tickets 

12. Such other supporting document that may be required.” 
 
The Cash Examination conducted on the cash and accounts of the PCF Custodian on

Audit of Disbursement Voucher (DV) No. 101-2008-2422 disclosed that the PCF totalling 
P200,000.00 was granted on August 12, 2020, for FAD-Property Section for payment of 
supplies, Information Technology (IT) peripherals and repair of equipment/facilities 
(building, electrical, construction, janitorial). However, it was noted that the following 
documents were not attached to the said DV as documentary requirements for granting 
PCF as provided under COA Circular No. 2012-001 and Section 36, Chapter 6 of GAM 
for NGAs, Volume I: 
 

 Certification from the Accountant that previous cash advances have been 
liquidated and accounted for in the books; 
 

 Approved application for bond and/or Fidelity Bond for the year for cash 
accountability of P5,001 or more as provided under Treasury Circular No. 02-
2009 dated August 6, 2009; and 
 

 Copy of policy for maintaining PCF under the imprest system. 
 

Further verification of records disclosed the following observations, to wit: 
 
a. The brief description of the nature of payment in the Petty Cash Fund Record 

(PCFR) was not properly indicated. It was also observed during the cash count that 
15 Petty Cash Vouchers (PCVs) or PCV Nos. 074 to 088 amounting to P60,362.19 
(Annex P) were not yet liquidated, with delay ranging from 5 to 40 days from the 
date of grant. It can be inferred that these purchases does not constitute emergency 
purchase that is required to be paid immediately. Also, any unutilized money may 
have been used for unauthorized purposes if not immediately liquidated/refunded. 
 

b. Verification per DV No. 101-2010-3084 showed that Check No. 416507 dated 
October 20, 2020, amounting to P150,102.57 was issued for the replenishment of 
the expenses charged to PCF from August 13 to October 1, 2020, or 1.5 months. 
Therefore, the PCF of P200,000.00 exceeded the one month requirement of 
P100,068.38, in violation of Section 35, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 
 

c. Moreover, review of PCV Nos. 001-073 disclosed that Preventive Maintenance 
Check-up of various vehicles and procurement of mobile prepaid cards recorded 
under Repairs and Maintenance - Transportation Equipment and Telephone 
Expenses amounting to P103,998.85 and P3,540.00, respectively (Annex Q) were 
paid out of the PCF. Due to the absence of policy for maintaining PCF under the 
imprest system, the fund was used to defray expenses which were not considered 
emergency and petty expenses but were classified as regular expenses and also not 
related to the purpose of the PCF, contrary to the provisions of Section 35.a, Chapter 
6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 
d. The result of post-audit of the Report on Paid Petty Cash Vouchers (RPPCVs) 

disclosed that purchases with amount ranging from P1,000.00 to P3,000.00 were not 
supported with Request for Quotation to confirm the supplier with lowest quotation 
and Abstract of Canvass from at least three suppliers. Absence of the necessary 
documents like Request for Quotations and Abstract of Canvass affects the validity 
and propriety of the disbursements made, and may signify weaknesses in the 
internal control over petty cash disbursements. Moreover, the date when the cash 



61 
 

was received upon request and the Boxes C and D upon liquidation of the PCV were 
not duly accomplished. 

 
The granting of PCF for more than the one month requirement exposes the cash to 
possible loss or misuse, in which fund could have been used for other purpose/s. 
Additionally, had Management established policies concerning the use of PCF, the 
abovementioned observations could have been avoided. 
 
We recommended that Management: 
 

a. reassess the accurate amount of PCF and prepare a duly approved estimates 
of petty expenses to be incurred for one month, and establish policies 
concerning the use of PCF, in compliance with Section 36, Chapter 6 of GAM 
for NGAs, Volume I; 
 

b. require the PCF Custodian to strictly adhere to the existing government 
rules, regulations and policies on the handling of the PCF subject to the 
proper use and liquidation of the fund, and properly accomplish the Petty 
Cash Voucher and Petty Cash Fund Record, in accordance with Appendices 
48 and 50 of GAM for NGAs, Volume II; 
 

c. instruct the PCF Custodian and the Accountant to refrain from charging 
regular expenses, pursuant to Section 35, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, 
Volume I and COA Circular No. 2012-001, and identify expenses that should 
be paid through checks; and 
 

d. direct the PCF Custodian to ensure that the claims thereof are supported 
with complete information/details, and the liquidations are supported with 
complete documentations. 

 

Management’s Comments:  
 
Management will: 
 

a. reassess the accurate amount of PCF and will prepare a duly approved estimates 
of petty expenses to be incurred for one month and will establish policies 
concerning the use of PCF, in compliance with Section 36, Chapter 6 of GAM for 
NGAs, Volume l; 
 

b. require the PCF Custodian to strictly adhere to the existing government rules, 
regulations and policies on the handling of the PCF subject to the proper use and 
liquidation of the fund, and properly accomplish the PCV and PCFR, in accordance 
with Appendices 48 and 50, GAM for NGAs, Volume II; 

 
c. instruct the PCF Custodian and the Accountant to refrain from charging regular 

expenses, pursuant to Section 35, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I and 
Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2012-001, and identify expenses that 
should be paid through checks; and  

 



62 
 

d. direct the PCF Custodian to ensure that the claims thereof are supported with 
complete information/details, and the liquidations are supported with complete 
documentations. 

 
9. The Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research 

and Development (PCAARRD) did not provide a complete list of all its ongoing 
projects and those that are to be implemented during the year at the prescribed 
time specified under Item 2.1 of Commission on Audit (COA) Circular No. 2013-004 
dated January 30, 2013. Likewise, they did not submit to the Audit Team copy of 
contracts and supporting documents on the 31 procurement projects with total 
contract amount of P43,948,812.74, within five working days from execution 
thereof, contrary to Item 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 
2009, thus preventing the Audit Team in conducting timely review of the 
procurement activities. 
 
The COA, which has the exclusive authority to promulgate accounting and auditing rules 
and regulations, including those for the prevention and disallowance of irregular, 
unnecessary, excessive, extravagant or unconscionable expenditures or uses of 
government funds and properties, issued COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated January 30, 
2013, amending the guidelines in implementing all government 
projects/programs/activities of government agencies. The salient features of the Circular 
state: 

 
“a. General Guidelines 
 
2.1 At the beginning of the year, all government agencies shall provide 
their respective assigned Supervising Auditors (SAs) and Audit Team 
Leaders (ATL) with a list of all on-going government 
projects/programs/activities (‘PPA’) and those that are to be implemented 
during the year. The list shall include the project name; implementing unit, 
office or division if it is not the agency as a whole; brief description of the 
PPA; contractor or supplier, if any; mode of procurement; funding source; 
cost or approved budget; project duration including the start and 
completion dates; and location. Other information on the PPA may be 
requested by the SA or ATL anytime for the audit purposes.” 

 
COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, restated with amendment COA 
Circular No. 87-278 and COA Memorandum No. 2005-027, re: submission of copy of 
government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents to COA. Item 
3.1.1 of the said Circular provides: 
 

“Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the 
government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including 
government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy 
of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by 
reference of incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the Agency 
concerned. In case of agencies audited on an engagement basis, submission 
of a copy of the contract and its supporting documents shall be to the Auditor 
of the mother agency or parent company, as the case may be.” 

 



63 
 

Item 3.1.2 of the said Circular enumerates the required documents to be included in the 
submission of contracts.  
 
Moreover, Item 4.1 of the same Circular states that any unjustified failure of the officials 
and employees concerned to comply with the requirements herein imposed shall be 
subject to the administrative disciplinary action provided in (a) Section 127 of 
Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445; (b) Section 55, Title I-B, Book V of the Revised 
Administrative Code of 1987; and (c) Section 11 of Republic Act (RA) No. 6713. 
 
Verifications of the documents submitted by the Agency relative to its procurement 
activities during calendar year (CY) 2020 disclosed that the PCAARRD did not submit a 
list of all its ongoing projects, and those to be implemented during the year at the 
beginning of the year, contrary to the afore-cited provisions of COA Circular. It is worthy 
to note, however, that the PCAARRD complied with submission of all their ongoing 
projects on a quarterly basis.  
 
Review of the procurement activities done by the BAC for CY 2020 showed that copies 
of contracts and the required supporting documents for the projects being implemented 
were not submitted to the Audit Team within five working days from the execution of 
contract provided in the mentioned COA Circular. On March 25, 2021, the Audit Team 
requested for the List of Procurement Projects/Contracts entered into in CY 2020, 
together with the complete bidding documents, to comply with RA No. 9184. However, 
only the list of projects amounting to P43,948,812.74 (Annex R) was submitted, viz:

The non-submission of the contracts and their supporting documents prevented the 
Audit Team in conducting timely review and verification of the transactions, which 
eventually delay the process of communicating to Management of any deficiency/ies 
noted.

We recommended that the Executive Director: 
 

a. direct the concerned officials to prepare the complete list of all ongoing 
projects/programs/activities (PPAs) and those that are to be implemented 
during the year, for audit validation and verification; and 

 
b. instruct the PCAARRD Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) Secretariat to 

provide valid explanations on non-submission of the contracts and 
supporting documents pertaining to the above projects. 

 
We further recommended that henceforth, the guidelines prescribed in COA 
Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, on the submission of contracts 
and supporting documents within five working days from the execution of a 
contract/purchase order be strictly complied by the BAC Secretariat. 

 
Management’s Comments:  
 
The Executive Director will: 
 

a. direct the Deputy Executive Director for Administration, Resource Management 
and Support Services/Chairperson, PCAARRD BAC to submit a copy of the 
complete contracts and supporting documents of the 2020 PCAARRD PPAs; and

from 46 Implementing Agencies 
(IAs); (b) 13 accounts from 12 IAs 
reported in the PCAARRD’s 
subsidiary ledgers have negative 
balances totaling P4.362 million; 
and (c) P1.465 billion or 53.27 
percent overdue accounts which 
remained unliquidated due to failure 
of the concerned officials and 
personnel to enforce prompt 
submission of Financial/Liquidation 
Reports, thereby affecting the fair 
presentation of the account. This is 
contrary to Sections 6.5 and 5.4 of 

We recommended that the

2019, cannot be relied upon due to 
the following: 
 

a) Non-reconciliation between 
accounting records and the 
results of the inventory-taking 
shown in the Report on the 
Physical Count of Property, 
Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) 
to identify the discrepancies 
amounting to P1,603,863.51 
and non-reversion of prior year’s 
derecognition or dropping from 
the books of various PPEs 
amounting to P16,223,550.68, 
without complete 
documentations, thus affecting 
the fair presentation of the PPE 
accounts in the Statement of 
Financial Position. This is 
contrary to Sections 38 and 39, 
Chapter 10 of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for 
National Government Agencies 
(NGAs), Volume I. 

 

We recommended that the 
Executive Director instruct the 
Inventory Committee to reconcile the 
results of the count with the property 
and accounting records after the 
physical inventory-taking. The 
inventory listing of the PPE should 
be compared with the Property Card 
maintained by the Property Section 
as against the PPE Ledger Cards 
maintained by the Accounting 
Section, and the total thereof should 
be reconciled with the control 
accounts in the General Ledger. All 
discrepancies noted between 
physical and book inventories must 
be investigated, cleared and 
reconciled. If necessary, written 
explanation should be required from 
accountable and responsible 
person. This is pursuant to Section 
38, Chapter 10 of GAM for NGAs, 
Volume I. 
 

The Inventory Team started 
the reconciliation of records 
immediately after the 
conduct of physical 
inventory (Physical Count 
completed in December 
2020). 
 
Concurrence in the 
Property Cards, PPE 
Ledger Cards, and PPE 
Inventory Listing were taken

as of December 31, 2019, could not 
be fully ascertained due to: (a) non-
conduct of physical count on Other 
Supplies and Materials Inventory and 
Semi-Expendable Inventories totaling

discrepancy of P3,127,219.56 
between the General Ledger (GL) 
balance and the Report on the 
Physical Count of Inventories 

We recommended that the 
Executive Director: 
 
a. direct the Inventory Committee 

to conduct complete physical 
count of all the inventories as at 
year end, and prepare the RPCI 
to record the results thereof. 
Thereafter, reconcile the 
accounting records against the 
RPCI and prepare the necessary 
adjusting entries to reflect the 
correct balance of the account;
