PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
Financial Audit 
 

Accounting Errors and Omissions 

 

1. The Other Supplies and Materials Inventory, Prepaid Insurance, and 
Computer Software accounts have misstatements totaling ₱1,308,440.08 or two 

percent (2%) of the National Academy of Science and Technology’s total assets of 

₱69,645,051.68 as at December 31, 2020. Moreover, the Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) account has misstatements totaling ₱1,252,002.72 or 42% percent 

of its total equity of ₱2,947,658.81 as at year-end, resulting in over/understatement 

of the affected accounts.  Due to the significant impact of such misstatements on the 

reported balances of the affected accounts, Management’s assertions as to the 

accuracy, existence, classification and cut-off of the said accounts could not be relied 

upon. 

 

2. Paragraph 15 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 
and Section 3, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, 

states that “Financial statements are a structured representation of the financial position 

and financial performance of an entity. The objectives of general purpose financial 

statements are to provide information about the financial position, financial 

performance, and cash flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making 

and evaluating decisions about the allocation of resources.” The standards further state 

that specifically, the objectives of general purpose financial reporting in the public sector 

should be to provide information useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the 

accountability of the entity for the resources entrusted to it. 

 

3. Paragraph 27 of the IPSAS provides that Financial Statements (FSs) shall present 
fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair 

presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other 

events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for 

assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, 

with additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements 

that achieve a fair presentation. 

 

4. Our audit revealed several accounting errors/omissions resulting in misstatements 
in account balances reported in the FSs of the NAST as summarized in Table 1.

Details of accounting errors and omissions: 

 

a) Erroneous recording of other supplies and materials account- P652,100.00 
 

7. Section 9, Chapter 8, GAM, Volume I provides that, “Supplies and materials 
purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual inventory system, 

resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running total for the cost of goods 

sold in each period.  The system requires accounting records to show the amount of 

inventory on hand at all times through the maintenance of the SLC (Appendix 57) by the 

Accounting Division/Unit and Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) by the Supply and/or 

Property Division/Unit for each item in stock. Regular purchases shall be coursed 

through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded as they take place 

except for supplies and materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on 

emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense accounts.”  

(underscoring ours) 
  

8. Analysis of the Inventory accounts balances of Other Supplies and Materials 
totaling P21,169.00 disclosed that purchases totaling P652,100.00 were recorded directly 

to expense account instead of using Inventory account as required under Section 9, 

Chapter 8, GAM, Volume I. Purchases as shown in Table 3 were directly charged to 

expense account.

9. Of the recorded purchases, we found out that the amount of P325,361.50 worth of 
supplies were still on stock under the watch of the Supply Officer affirming of its usage 

in the forthcoming events of the Academy, but no longer reported in the inventory report 

nor recorded in the SLC of the Accounting Division as at December 31, 2020. 

  



29 

 

 

10. The Perpetual Inventory System of recording supplies and materials was not 
observed to arrive at the correct ending balance of Inventory.  Recording purchases of 

supplies and materials as outright expenses not only exposes the inventories to risk of 

loss or misuse but also misstates both the inventory and expense accounts for stock items 

at any given time, contrary to the above provisions of Sections 9, Chapter 8, GAM, 

Volume I.   

 

11. The above-cited accounting errors and omissions resulted in the overstatement of 
Other Supplies and Materials expenses and understatement of Inventory accounts by 

₱325,361.50, thus, affecting the assertions of accuracy, existence and cut-off of these 

assets. 

 

12. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 
 

a. diligently use the perpetual inventory system in the recording of 
Inventories in accordance with Section 9, Chapter 8, GAM, Volume I; 

and 

 

b. restore the amount of P325,361.50 worth of supplies to the Inventory 
account and record the expense account at the time of its issuance. 

 

b) Erroneous recording of Other prepayments  
 

13. Section 6 (d), Chapter 1 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume 
I states that “Each entity shall recognize and present its financial transactions and 

operations conformably to: (d) Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) prescribed by COA”, 

among others. 
  

14. Volume III of the GAM for NGAs provides the guidelines for the RCA that must 
be used in presenting the financial transactions of the government. These include, among 

others, the following: 
 

Computer Software is used to recognize the purchase cost or capitalized 

development cost of computer software programs for use in government 

operation. Development costs include cost of coding, testing and cost to 

produce product masters. Credit this account for obsolescence, transfers or 

other disposal. 
 

Accumulated Amortization-Computer Software is credited for the allocation of 

cost of computer software in accordance with the prescribed policy on 

amortization.  
 

Other Prepayments is used to recognize the amount of prepayments not falling 

under any of the specific prepayment accounts.  
 

15. As at December 31, 2020, the balance of the Computer Software account 
amounted to P449,634.47. Included in the computation of its year-end balance were 



30 

 

various acquisitions totalling P560,236.07 which pertained to prepayments of software 

and information and communications technology subscriptions, as shown in Table 4:

16. The above-listed transactions were recorded as Computer Software considered as 
additional cost to computer software programs presumed as part of the product master or 

systems, but it clearly pertained to prepayments/subscriptions as suggested by the 

corresponding period of effectivity that is subject to renewal; thus, should have been 

recorded as Other Prepayments instead of Computer Software. Accordingly, expense 

should be recognized immediately for the expired portion.  

 

17. Commencing from the date the items were delivered to and received by the 
agency, the expired and unexpired portions of these prepayments are presented in Table

₱138,092.78  ₱422,143.29 

 

18. As a result of the improper classification of accounts, the Computer Software and 
Other Prepayments accounts were overstated and understated, respectively, by the 

amount of ₱422,143.29, while the Accumulated Amortization-Computer Software and the 



31 

 

Subscription Expense accounts were likewise overstated and understated, respectively, by 

₱138,092.78 at year-end. These accounting errors and omissions likewise affected the 

assertions of accuracy, existence and cut-off of the said assets. 

 

19. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
make the necessary reclassification of the accounts Computer Software, Other 

Prepayments, and the adjusting entries for the related expenses account to recognize 

the expired portion of the prepayments, pursuant to the pertinent rules and 

regulations of the GAM. 

 

c. Erroneous recording of Honoraria  

 

20. COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020, also known as the Revised 
Chart of Accounts (RCA) - Updated 2019, states that “Honoraria account shall be 

debited to recognize the payment given to professionals for services in recognition of 

their expertise, broad and superior knowledge in specific fields and special projects.  

This also includes payments to lecturers, resource persons, coordinators and facilitators 

in seminars, training programs and other similar activities in training institutions 

including those who render services beyond their regular workload”. 

 

21. Verification of records showed that the payment of honoraria to resource persons 
and evaluators were improperly recognized to Other Professional Services account.  This 

also included honoraria to personnel assigned in special projects and those who are 

members of Committees. 

 

22. The errors resulted in the improper classification of expenses totaling 
₱1,064,734.00, which ultimately overstated the accounts Other Professional Services and 

understated the Honoraria account by ₱1,064,734.00. 

 

23. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 
observe consistency in the recording of transactions, and properly classify the 

expenses to the Honoraria account following the Revised Chart of Accounts. 

 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

Long-outstanding and unreconciled balance of Due to NGAs 

 

24. The Due to NGAs account balance as at year-end was not fairly presented 
due to: (a) accumulation of outstanding balance of ₱61,422,793.84, of which 

₱48,423,863.08 remained unliquidated and ₱8,374,262.29 unexpended balances 

which were not refunded to the Source Agency (SA) despite project completion; and 

(b) significant variance of ₱38,567,278.08 between the Implementing Agency (IA) 

and the SA’s books for failure to conduct regular reconciliation.  

 



32 

 

a) Accumulation of outstanding balance of P61,422,793.84, of which ₱48,423,863.08 

remained unliquidated and ₱8,374,262.29 unexpended balances were not refunded 

to SA despite project completion 

25. The Academy as the Implementing Agency (IA) of the fund transfers implements 
various projects under the Grants-in-Aid (GIA) Program.  As implementer, grants from 

the Source Agency (SA) such as the Department of Science and Technology-Office of 

the Secretary (DOST-OSEC), are taken up in the books of the Academy as Due to NGAs.    

 

26. Section 6 of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 14, 1994, provides that: 
 

6.  DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY  

 

a. within five (5) days after the end of each month, the Accountable 
Officer (AO) shall prepare the RCI and the RD and shall submit 

them with all supporting vouchers/payrolls and documents to the 

Accountant.  These reports shall be approved by the Head of the 

Agency; 

 

6.5 within ten (10) days after receipt from the AO, the Accountant shall 

verify the Reports, provide accounting entries, record and submit the 

duplicate copies of the Reports with all the originals of vouchers/payrolls 

and all supporting documents to the IA Auditor.  The Accountant shall 

ensure that only expenses for the project are included in the Reports.  He 

shall submit the original copy of the Reports to the SA (Attention: The SA 

Accountant). 

 

27. Furthermore, Section 4.9 of the same Circular, also provides that the 
Implementing Agency (IA) shall return to the Source Agency (SA) any unused balance 

upon completion of the project. Likewise, Section 63, Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume I, 

requires that the IA shall return to the SA any unused balance upon completion of the 

project, if stipulated in the Memoranda of Agreement (MOA). 

 

28. The MOA covering the fund transfers stipulates that all unexpended balances 
shall be reported immediately and remitted or returned to the SA after completion or 

termination of the project.  

 

29. Verification of the affected accounts showed the non-adherence to the above 
provision by the Academy as the balance of account Due to NGAs has reached a 

significant accumulated total of ₱61,422,793.84 as at December 31, 2020. 

 

30. It was established that the Academy, as the IA of the GIA-funded projects, had 
been lenient in adhering to its duties and responsibilities provided in Sections 6.4, and 6.5 

of COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 14, 1994, that monthly Report of Checks 

Issued (RCI) and Report of Disbursements (RD) shall be prepared by the Accountable 

Officer and verified by the Accountant, and recorded in the books of the IA. As a result, 



33 

 

project funds in prior years remained unliquidated and the balance of the account Due to 

NGAs continuously increased every year thereafter due to additional new projects being 

released by the DOST-OSEC, such that even the completed projects totaling 

₱48,423,863.08 remained unliquidated.  Had the Academy been steadfast in abiding by 

its duties and responsibilities as the IA, especially in the liquidation of the fund transfers, 

the accumulation of the balance would not have occurred.  

 

31. Moreover, the non-liquidation also laid-up unexpended balances of the completed 
projects totaling ₱8,374,262.29 which remained idle and unutilized in the custody of the 

Academy.   

 

32. The accumulation of unliquidated fund transfers with completed projects and 
unutilized fund balances reflected the Academy’s lack of compliance in diligently 

fulfilling its duties and responsibilities as IA and this deprived the government of the 

maximum utilization of resources for other priority projects needing funds.  

 

b) Discrepancy between NAST and DOST books of accounts by ₱38,567,278.08 

33. Confirmation of the fund transfers from DOST-OSEC revealed the discrepancy of 
₱38,567,278.08 vis-à-vis the recorded balances in the Academy’s books as at December 

31, 2020. The overall variance was computed as follows: 
 

NAST balance per books     ₱ 61,422,793.84  
Less: Per confirmation - DOST books                            99,990,071.92  
Variance                ₱ (38,567,278.08) 
 

34. The variance was due to the unrecorded liquidation reports submitted to the SA 
by the IA. This variance is attributable to the Academy and the DOST’s lack of regular 

reconciliation of records and balances to ensure that the liquidations submitted meet the 

required documentation and are accordingly recorded completely and accurately in the IA 

and SA books.  

 

35. As a result, the significant amount of variance negatively affected the reliability, 
accuracy and, more importantly, the existence of the said balances in the books of both 

agencies.   

  

36. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. require the Accountant, in coordination with project personnel-
accountable officer, to cause the liquidation of unliquidated balances of 

fund transfers and the immediate refund of unexpended balances of 

completed projects to the SA as at December 31, 2020; 

 

b. henceforth, strictly comply with Sections 4.9, 6.4 and 6.5 of COA Circular 
No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 and Section X.C.4 of DOST AO No. 

11, series of 2020, dated September 2, 2020, for Grants-in-Aid projects, to 



34 

 

return immediately the unexpended balance within three (3) months after 

completion of the project period; and 

 

c. initiate the reconciliation of the balances of Due to NGAs vis-à-vis the 
SA’s records, specifically the DOST-OSEC as against the Academy’s 

books before adjusting the records of both agencies to establish the 

correct balances of their respective accounts. 

 

37. In summary, due to the significant impact on the financial statements of the total 
misstatements of ₱1,308,440.08 and ₱1,252,002.72 which represent 2% and 42 % of its 

total assets and equity, respectively, and with total deficiencies of P48,423,863.08  or 

65.33 percent of its total liabilities, we rendered a Qualified Opinion on the financial 

statements of the NAST as at year-end. 

 

Compliance Audit 
 

Inadequate monitoring of purchases from PS-DBM 

 

38. The absence of regular monitoring of deliveries made by the Procurement 
Service of the Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) resulted in the 

accumulated balance of ₱701,891.66 and delays in the delivery of the procured office 

supplies and plane tickets.   

 

39. Section 20 of the General Provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 11465 or the 
General Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 requires that all agencies 

of the government shall purchase common-use supplies from the Procurement Service 

(PS) as mandated under LOI No. 755 dated October 18, 1978, E.O. No. 359 s. 1989, A.O. 

No. 17 s. 2011 and such other guidelines issued thereon.  Common-use supplies shall 

refer to those included in the Electronic Catalogue of the PS which shall be regularly 

updated to include all items commonly procured by agencies of the government. 

 

40. Relative thereto, the Academy procured most of its office supplies and plane 
tickets from the PS-DBM, including plane tickets purchased from the Philippine Airlines 

(PAL) and Cebu Pacific. As such, advance payments were therefore made corresponding 

to the total amount indicated in the Agency Purchase Request (APR).  The advance 

payment was thereafter recorded as Due from NGAs and credited upon acceptance of 

items delivered by the PS. 

 

41. As of December 31, 2020, the Due from NGAs account had a book balance of 
₱701,891.66 as presented in Table 6.

43. Analysis and validations revealed that a significant portion of the balance of 
₱701,891.66, i.e., ₱670,579.33 or 96 percent, pertained to fund transfers to the PS-DBM 

for plane fare tickets of the resource speakers, secretariat and the like, for the 

implementation of projects in several regions for CYs 2018 and 2019. In effect, the non-

availment of plane tickets for the past two (2) years as a result of their unimplemented 

projects left the funds idle at PS-DBM; thus, it did not serve the intended purpose.         

 

44. The above deficiencies could have been prevented had there been a regular 
monitoring and planning of advance payments/transfers against deliveries; thus, project 

implementation of the Academy in the year it was planned could have been completed 

and the unused funds could have been used to subsidize other priority projects of the 

government. 

 

45. We recommended and Management agreed to require the PS-DBM to refund 
the accumulated payments and subsequently remit the amount to the Bureau of the 

Treasury (BTr).  

 

Unnecessary expenses 

 

46. Procurement of supplies and materials for the GIA-funded project was 
deemed unnecessary and contrary to Section B.1 of DOST Administrative Order 

(AO) No. 005 s. of 2013 dated April 23, 2013. 

 

47. Section 5.2b6 of DOST AO No. 005 s. of 2013 dated April 23, 2013, as amended 
by Section IX,b6 of DOST AO No. 11 s. of 2020 dated September 2, 2020, which 

provide  for the guidelines of Grant-in-Aid (GIA) funds of the DOST and its agencies, 

define Supplies and Materials as cost of items to be used  in specialized S&T work (e.g., 

office supplies, accountable forms, zoological supplies, drugs and medicine, laboratory 

supplies, gasoline, oil and lubricants, agricultural supplies, text books/instructional 



36 

 

materials, and other supplies).  It also includes all expendable commodities acquired or 

ordered for use in connection with project implementation.  

 

48. Upon verification of the purchased supplies and materials intended for the GIA 
projects, we noted that it included purchases worth ₱315,100.00, as shown in Table 8, 

which were deemed dispensable to the implementation of the projects.  Personalized ball 

pens, bags and boxes, and custom-made t’nalak lanyards were complimentary items and 
could not be considered as direct cost and connected with the projects.  Section 5.2b6 of 

DOST AO No. 005 dated April 23, 2013, as amended by DOST AO No. 11 s. of 2020, on 

the Revised Guidelines for the Grants-In-Aid Program of the DOST and its agencies, 

specifically on direct cost, requires that expenses incurred by the implementing agency in 

the execution of the projects should be necessary and connected to its operation.

Inconsistencies in the payment of honoraria for special projects 

 

50. Computation of honoraria paid to personnel assigned in Special Projects 
amounting to ₱391,000.00 was not in accordance with the provisions of DBM-DOST 

Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 dated June 25, 

2013 and October 1, 2007, respectively.  

 

51. DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 dated June 25, 2013 prescribed the 
Rules and Regulations on the Grant of Compensation-Related Magna Carta Benefits to 

Scientists, Engineers, Researchers and Other Science and Technology (S&T) Personnel.  

The Circular provided the computation of honoraria for personnel assigned to special 

projects, as follows: 

 

Section 4.3 As token payment for services rendered beyond the regular duties 

and responsibilities of their positions, Honoraria for Assignment in Special 

Projects may be granted. 

 

4.3.1 The total Honoraria per personnel for a month shall be based on 

productivity and quality of completed and accepted deliverables for the set 

timeframe.  Hence, a special project plan shall be prepared, in consultation 



37 

 

with all personnel concerned, subject to approval by the agency head.  Such 

plan shall contain the following details: 

 

4.3.1.1   Outputs or deliverables per project component; 

 

4.3.1.2   Project timetable; 

 

4.3.1.3 Personnel assigned to the special project and their duties and      

responsibilities; 

 

4.3.1.4 Expected deliverables per personnel; and 

 

4.3.1.5 Estimated cost of monthly honoraria for each personnel based on work 

hours spent beyond the regular work hours, computed as follows: 

 

Estimated Honoraria, H =  
Salary 1 Month 1 Day 

T Hours 
Month 22 Days 8 Hours 

 
Where: 

           Salary – Step 1 of the Salary Grade of the designated position 
           T         = estimated numbers of work hours spent in the special 
project 

 

4.3.2   The total Honoraria that may be paid from government funds for all 

special projects shall not exceed 25% of the employee’s annual basic salary 

pursuant to Section 44(e) of R.A. No. 10352 and as may be reiterated in 

subsequent GAAs. 

 

52. Moreover, DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 dated October 1, 2007 also provides 
the Guidelines on the Grant of Honoraria Due to Assignment in Government Special 

Projects such that:  

 

Section 4.5 states that payment of the honorarium shall be made only upon 

completion and acceptance by the agency head of the deliverable per project 

component. 

  

Section 4.6 The actual honorarium to be paid to each personnel shall depend 

on the performance rating to be given by the project management, as follows: 

  

Performance Rating 
% of Estimated Honoraria per project 

Component 

Outstanding 100% 

Very Satisfactory 85% 

Satisfactory 70% 

 

For example, if the performance rating is Very Satisfactory, the actual 

honorarium to be paid follows:  
 



38 

 

Actual Honorarium = 85% (H) 
 

Section 4.7 For rating purposes, the project management shall formulate a 

performance evaluation plan that is transparent and fair, and considers 

timeliness, quality of outputs, and other applicable work efficiency 

determinants. 

 

53. As of December 31, 2020, honoraria amounting to P391,000.00 were paid to 
science and technology personnel for their services rendered on special projects which 

were conducted beyond their regular duties and responsibilities as well as beyond their 

regular working hours.  

 

54. Evaluation of the documents disclosed that computation of honoraria were not in 
accordance with DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular 

No. 2007-2 which are the specific guidelines issued on the grant of honoraria due to 

assignment for special projects as cited above; instead they followed the policy of DOST 

Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 001 s. 2009, amending DOST MC No. 001 s. 2003 also 

known  as “Revised Implementing Guidelines on the grant of Honoraria to personnel 

whose services are engaged by the National Science and Technology System”. 

 

55. Computation of honoraria per DOST MC No. 001 s. 2009 were fixed at a specific 
rate per month depending on the level of position the personnel was assigned. For 

instance, if the personnel is assigned as a project/program staff, level 2, with honoraria 

rate of ₱6,000.00 per month, for the period of three (3) months the total payment would 

be ₱18,000.00.  

 

56. The implementation of the said Memorandum Circular clearly deviates from the 
guidelines set under DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular 

No. 2007-2 as it did not consider the productivity and quality of completed and accepted 

deliverables for the set timeframe.   Likewise, adequate planning has not been performed 

as special project plan containing details enumerated in Section 4.3.1.1 to Section 4.3.1.5 

of DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 were not provided.  

 

57. The project management also failed to formulate performance evaluation plan for 
rating purposes that considers transparency and fairness, timeliness, quality of outputs, 

and other applicable work efficiency determinants.  These performance ratings will be 

used in the payment of actual honorarium as prescribed in DBM Budget Circular No. 

2007-2. 

 

58. In line with the foregoing, the payments of honoraria to personnel assigned to 
special projects which are not in accordance with the guidelines set under DBM-DOST 

Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 are deemed to be 

irregular and disadvantageous to government spending. 

 

 

 

 



39 

 

59. We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. Strictly comply with the guidelines set under DBM-DOST Joint 
Circular No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 on the 

computation of honorarium payment to personnel assigned in special 

projects; 

 

b. Adequately plan the implementation of the project by preparing a 
special project plan considering the details enumerated in Section 

4.c3.1.1 to Section 4.3.1.5 of DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013; 

and 

 

c. Formulate a performance evaluation plan for rating purposes which 
will be used in the payment of actual honorarium. 

 

Management Comment 

 

60. Management commented that the use of DOST MC 001, s. 2009 (DOST-MC) 
rates were aptly indicated in the approved Line-Item Budget (LIB) of the DOST-GIA 

projects. Under the DOST Administrative Order 011, s. 2020 on the Revised Guidelines 

for the Grants-in-Aid Funds of DOST and its Agencies, the disbursements of funds shall 

be in accordance with an approved LIB (Sec. C.2). 

 

61. Management further commented that comparison of the rates of honorarium 
between the DBM-DOST JC and the DOST MC showed that the rates of honorarium 

computed under the DBM-DOST JC is higher than the DOST MC.  Therefore, the 

payment of honorarium does not constitute an irregular government spending as the 

amount actually paid was lower than what should be received by the project staff.  

Moreover, on the Annual Work Plan for the project, this is a basic requirement before the 

payment of honorarium.  

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 

62. We maintain our stand that the computation be based on the provisions of DBM-
DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 dated June 25, 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 

2007-2 dated October 1, 2007 and that the documentary requirements be made available 

to the team to validate the correct computation of honoraria rates, such as: (a) expected 

deliverables per personnel assigned to the project per project component at specified 

timeframes; (b) cost by project component, including the estimated cost for honoraria for 

each personnel based on man-hours to be spent in the project beyond the regular work 

hours; and (c) the rating of performance of the personnel assigned.

Improper payment of honoraria to government personnel 

 

63. Honoraria granted were directly received by the resource person employed 
in a government agency; thus, benefits received were not properly accounted and 

monitored for the 25 percent threshold and for taxation purposes. 

 

64. Section 23 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, or the Tax 
Reform Act of 1997, states that “A citizen of the Philippines residing therein is taxable on 

all income derived from sources within and without the Philippines.” 

 

65. Further, Section 272 of the same Act on  Violation of Withholding Tax Provision, 
states that “Every officer or employee of the Government of the Republic of the 

Philippines or any of its agencies and instrumentalities, its political subdivisions, as well 

as government-owned or-controlled corporations, including the Bangko Sentral ng 

Pilipinas (BSP), who, under the provisions of this Code or rules and regulations 

promulgated thereunder, is charged with the duty to deduct and withhold any internal 

revenue tax and to remit the same in accordance with the provisions of this Code and 

other laws is guilty of any offense herein below specified shall, upon conviction for each 

act or omission be punished by a fine of not less than Five thousand pesos (P5,000) but 

not more than Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000) or suffer imprisonment of not less than six 

(6) months and one (1) day but not more than two (2) years, or both: 

 

a. Failing or causing the failure to deduct and withhold any internal revenue tax 
under any of the withholding tax laws and implementing rules and regulations; 

b. Failing or causing the failure to remit taxes deducted and withheld within the 
time prescribed by law, and implementing rules and regulations; and 

c. Failing or causing the failure to file return or statement within the time 
prescribed, or rendering or furnishing a false or fraudulent return or statement 

required under the withholding tax laws and rules and regulations.” 

 

66. Likewise, Section 4.3.2 of DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 dated June 
25, 2013 stipulates that the total honoraria that may be paid from government funds for 

all special projects shall not exceed 25% of the employee’s annual basic salary pursuant 

to Section 44(e) of R.A. No. 10352 and as also reiterated in Section 53 of the GAA for 

FY 2020. 

 

67. Government personnel who act as lecturers, resource persons, coordinators or 
facilitators in other government agencies which are outside of their mother agencies, may 

be paid honoraria at such rates as may be determined by the agency authorities 

concerned.  Further, science and technology personnel who render services beyond the 

established workload of scientists, technologists, researchers and technicians whose 

broad and superior knowledge, expertise or professional standing in a specific field 

contributes to productivity and innovativeness shall be entitled to receive honoraria in 

accordance with the guidelines prescribed in DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 

and DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-1 & 2.  

 



41 

 

68. Records disclosed that honoraria were paid directly to the said government 
personnel and not to their respective mother agency.  Management reasoned that the 

amount was very minimal and transferring the amount to the agency or institutions 

seemed impractical since the recipient agency will have to go through the usual 

procedure, i.e, request a certification from BTr of the deposited amount, then request for 

the release of SARO and NCA from DBM.   

 

69.   Honoraria directly paid to government personnel may not be reported to their 
mother agency, making it hard for the latter to properly account and monitor the amount 

of honoraria received for taxation and 25 percent threshold purposes. 

 

70. Although verification showed that payments of honoraria were constantly 
deducted a ten percent (10%) withholding tax by the Academy, honoraria received by 

government personnel are considered additional income in which, for taxation purposes, 

it should be included/declared in the government personnel’s individual income tax 

returns.  Consequently, any taxes withheld by the paying agency should be supported by 

certifications which serve as a proof that applicable taxes had been deducted/withheld. 

 

71. Moreover, payment of honoraria entails some limitations particularly on the 
honoraria received for all special projects which shall not exceed 25 percent (25%) of the 

employee’s annual basic salary, thus should be accounted for and properly monitored.    

 

72. We recommended and Management agreed to remit the payment for 
honoraria to the respective mother agencies of the government personnel and to 

issue the corresponding certificates on the taxes withheld.  

 

Other Compliance Issues 
 

Gender and Development (GAD) 
 

73. The Academy implemented and mainstreamed activities embodied in the 
GAD Plan which addressed gender issues and concerns with actual expenditures of 

₱42,560,290.98 or 43.81 percent of its appropriation of ₱97,151,079.00,  in 

compliance with Section 31 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations 

Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020. 
 

74. Section 31 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA and Section 36 of RA 
9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, both state that the agency’s Gender and 
Development (GAD) budget shall be at least five percent (5%) of its total budget 
appropriations. 
 

75. Section 36 (b), Chapter VI, also provides that all departments, including their 
attached agencies, offices, bureaus, state universities and colleges, government-owned 
and controlled corporations, local government units, and other government 
instrumentalities shall establish or strengthen their GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) or 
similar GAD mechanism to catalyze and accelerate gender mainstreaming within the 
agency or local government unit. The GFPS shall be composed of the agency head or 



42 

 

local chief executive, an executive committee with an Undersecretary (or its equivalent), 
local government unit official, or office in a strategic decision-making position as Chair; 
and a technical working group or secretariat which is composed of representatives from 
various divisions or offices within the agency or local government unit. The tasks and 
functions of the members of the GFP shall form part of their regular key result areas and 
shall be given due consideration in their performance evaluation. 
 

76. Section 4 of Philippine Commission on Women-National Economic Development 
Authority - Department of Budget and Management Joint Circular (PCW-NEDA-DBM 
JC) No. 2012-01 states that the agency shall develop or integrate in its existing database 
GAD information to include gender statistics and sex disaggregated data that have been 
systematically produced or gathered as inputs or bases for planning, budgeting, 
programming and policy information. 
 

77. Gender statistics are defined in the Gender Statistics Manual as statistics that 
adequately reflect differences and inequalities in the situation of women and men in all 
areas of life. 

 

78. The GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) for CY 2020 was prepared by the Academy on 
the basis of the PCW’s approved GAD activities. 
  

79. The Gender issues and concerns, as well as GAD Accomplishments of the 
Academy for CY 2020 amounting to ₱43,560,290.98 are shown in Tables 9 and 10.

Total 42,572,290.98 

 

80. Review of the Academy’s GPB and GAD accomplishment for CY 2020 revealed 
that the planned activities were implemented. The gender issues were also addressed.   
 

81. We recommended and Management agreed to continuously be involved in 
more programs, activities and projects that are gender responsive, and comply with 

and attribute the allocation of at least five percent (5%) of the agency’s 



43 

 

appropriations for the implementation of more GAD-related gender-responsive 

programs and activities.                                              

 
Senior Citizens and Differently-Abled Persons 

 

82. The Academy complied with Section 32 of the General Provisions of the FY 
2020 GAA. 

 

83. Section 32 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA provides that all 
agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to 
address the concerns of Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs), 
insofar as its relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular 
activities. It further requires that all government infrastructure and facilities shall 
provide architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will reasonably 
enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of the persons with disability pursuant to Batas 
Pambansa (BP) Blg. 344 and RA 7277. 
 

84. The Academy’s programs and activities for the SCs and PWDs which were 
implemented in CY 2020 are summarized in Table 11. 

 
Table 11. Summary of Activities for Senior Citizens 

Objectives of RA 9994 NAST Programs/Activities 

To motivate and encourage senior citizens to 
contribute to nation building. 

The Academy is implementing the research fellowship 
program to encourage its members especially the retired 
ones to continue doing research. Research fellowship 
granted for the year to elderly academicians amounted to 
₱3,390,000.00. 

To provide a comprehensive health care and 
rehabilitation system for disabled senior citizens to 
foster their capacity to attain a more meaningful and 
productive ageing. 

Pursuant to PD 1003-A, as amended, the Academicians 
and National Scientists (NS) are entitled to reimbursement 
of medical expenses.  

To recognize the rights of senior citizens to take their 
proper place in society and make it a concern of the 
family, community and government. 

One of the privileges of NS is to be accorded a place of 
honor in state functions, national commendation 
ceremonies and all other cultural presentations. The 
Academy ensures that NS receive this honor in all its 
activities. 

 

85. Perusal of the Academy’s programs/activities for the SCs and PWDs, as 
enumerated in the above table, disclosed that the Academy is compliant with Section 32 
of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA in addressing the concerns of SC and 
PWDs.  
  

86. We commended the Management and agreed to continuously comply with 
the General Provisions of the GAA in addressing the concerns of SCs and PWDs. 

 
Youth Development 

 

87. In CY 2020, the Academy implemented programs and activities aimed at 
promoting and encouraging the youth to pursue careers in science, such as Virtual 



44 

 

Symposium for the Youth, Meet Your Scientist, Salinlahi Symposium Series and 
Salinlahi Evolution Conference: Presentation and Awarding Ceremony. 

 

88. We recommended and Management agreed to continuously conduct 
programs/activities related to youth development. 
 

Compliance with Property Insurance Law        

 

89. The Academy has insured all its insurable property, assets and interests with the 
General Insurance Fund (GIF) administered by the Government Service Insurance 
System (GSIS) amounting to ₱303,660.75 under Official Receipt No. 7700050589 dated 
April 4, 2020, with effectivity date of January 1, 2020 and expiring on December 31, 
2020, under Policy ID 1000651791. The total property insured amounted to 
₱112,141,970.00. 
 

Hiring of Contractual 

  
90. The Academy hired a total of 21 job-order (JO) employees with salaries and 
wages totaling ₱10,905,491.75 which were recorded in the books of accounts as Other 
Professional Services for CY 2020. These JOs were hired to augment its 15-man 
workforce for the implementation of its programs.  Comparison of the job descriptions 
vis-à-vis accomplishments of JOs showed that they performed activities which involved 
research and assisted in round table discussions and seminars, among others. 

 

Compliance with other Mandatory Accounts 
 
91. For CY 2020, the Academy has deducted from the salaries of its personnel the 
required taxes, GSIS, PhilHealth and Pag-IBIG contributions and remitted the same as 
well as the government share within the prescribed period to the concerned institutions or 
agencies. A summary is shown in Table 12.
