EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

A. Introduction 
 

The National Academy of Science and Technology (NAST) was created in 1976 

by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 1003-A to recognize outstanding achievements in 

science and technology and to serve as a reservoir of competent scientific and 

technological manpower in the country. 

 

In 1982, through Executive Order No. 818, the Agency was also made as adviser 

on science and technology to the President of the Republic of the Philippines and the 

members of the Cabinet. The Agency is mandated to perform the following: 

 

1. To recognize outstanding achievements in science and technology as well as 
provide meaningful incentives to those engaged in scientific and technological 

researches; 

2. To advise the President and the Cabinet on matters related to science and 
technology; 

3. To engage in projects and programs designed to recognize outstanding 
achievements in science and promote scientific productivity; 

4. To embark on programs traditionally expected of an academy of science; and 
5. To manage, operate and maintain the Philippine Science Heritage Center. 
 

There are at present 77 NAST members who are called “Academicians” and 12 of 

whom are national scientists. The Academicians and other local experts put their 

knowledge together to advise the legislators and the Senate, including other policy 

making bodies of the government and non-government entities, on policies related to 

science and technology.  The Academicians are not government officials but are entitled 

to monthly gratuity, medical benefits, publications and travel assistance pursuant to 

Presidential Decree No. 1003-A as amended.  

 

The general administration and direction of the affairs of the Academy are vested 

on its seven (7) members called the Executive Council who are appointed by the 

President of the Philippines for a term of three (3) years. 

 

The Executive Director of NAST heads the NAST Secretariat, implements the 

decisions of the Executive Council, and attends to the daily affairs of the Academy. The 

offices under her direct jurisdiction are the Finance and Administrative Division (FAD) 

and the Technical Services Division (TSD). As of December 31, 2020, NAST has 15 

secretariat workforce. In addition, 21 contractual employees were hired to assist the FAD 

and for the different projects implemented by NAST.  

 

B. Operational Highlights 
 

One of the Major Final Outputs of the Academy’s operations is the Promotion and 

Recognition of Scientific and Technological Efforts and Achievements. The Academy’s

activity conducted physically

NAST activities, such as 
webinars, fore, and the likes.

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of the National Academy of 

Science and Technology for the year ended December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted 

to: (a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed in Management’s assertions on the 

financial statements; (b) recommend Agency’s improvement opportunities; (c) determine 

the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules 

and regulations; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years audit 

recommendations. 

  

E. Independent Auditor’s Report 
  

A qualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements as at December 31, 

2020 due to the significant impact on the financial statements of the total misstatements 

of ₱1,308,440.08 and ₱1,252,002.72 which represent 2% and 42% of its total assets and 



 iv 

equity, respectively, and with total deficiencies of P48,423,863.08 or 65.33 percent of its 

total liabilities. 

 

F. Summary of Other Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following were significant audit observations to be addressed, details of 

which are further discussed in the Part II of the report.  

 

1. The Due to NGAs account balance as at year-end was not fairly presented due to: 
(a) accumulation of outstanding balance of ₱61,422,793.84, of which ₱48,423,863.08 

remained unliquidated and ₱8,374,262.29 unexpended balances which were not refunded 

to the Source Agency (SA) despite project completion; and (b) significant variance of 

₱38,567,278.08 between the Implementing Agency (IA) and the SA’s books for failure to 

conduct regular reconciliation.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. require the Accountant, in coordination with project personnel-
accountable officer, to cause the liquidation of unliquidated balances of 

fund transfers and the immediate refund of unexpended balances of 

completed projects to the SA as at December 31, 2020; 

 

b. henceforth, strictly comply with Sections 4.9, 6.4 and 6.5 of COA Circular 
No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 and Section X.C.4 of DOST AO No. 

11, series of 2020, dated September 2, 2020, for Grants-in-Aid projects, to 

return immediately the unexpended balance within three (3) months after 

completion of the project period; and 

 

c. initiate the reconciliation of the balances of Due to NGAs vis-à-vis the 
SA’s records, specifically the DOST-OSEC as against the Academy’s 

books before adjusting the records of both agencies to establish the 

correct balances of their respective accounts. 

 

2. The absence of regular monitoring of deliveries made by the Procurement Service 
of the Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) resulted in the accumulated 

balance of ₱701,891.66 and delays in the delivery of the procured office supplies and 

plane tickets.   

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the PS-DBM to refund 

the accumulated payments and subsequently remit the amount to the Bureau of the 

Treasury (BTr).  

 

3. Procurement of supplies and materials for the GIA-funded project was deemed 
unnecessary and contrary to Section B.1 of DOST Administrative Order (AO) No. 005 s. 

of 2013 dated April 23, 2013. 

 



 v 

We recommended and Management agreed to ensure their strict compliance 

with all pertinent provisions DOST AO No. 11 s. of 2020. 

 

4. Computation of honoraria paid to personnel assigned in Special Projects 
amounting to ₱391,000.00 was not in accordance with the provisions of DBM-DOST 

Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 dated June 25, 2013 

and October 1, 2007, respectively. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. Strictly comply with the guidelines set under DBM-DOST Joint Circular 
No. 1, s. 2013 and DBM Budget Circular No. 2007-2 on the computation 

of honorarium payment to personnel assigned in special projects; 

 

b. Adequately plan the implementation of the project by preparing a 
special project plan considering the details enumerated in Section 4.3.1.1 

to Section 4.3.1.5 of DBM-DOST Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2013; and 

 

c. Formulate a performance evaluation plan for rating purposes which will 
be used in the payment of actual honorarium. 

 

5. Honoraria granted were directly received by the resource person employed in a 
government agency; thus, benefits received were not properly accounted and monitored 

for the 25 percent threshold and for taxation purposes. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to remit the payment for 

honoraria to the respective mother agencies of the government personnel and to 

issue the corresponding certificates on the taxes withheld.  

 

The audit observations and recommendations were communicated with the 

Auditee through the issuance of Summary of Observations and Recommendations 

(SAOR).  Likewise, it was presented to the concerned officials of NAST in an exit 

conference conducted on April 29, 2021. Management’s views and comments were 

considered in the report, where appropriate.
