EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Insurance Commission (IC) is mandated to regulate and supervise the insurance 

industry in accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Code in order to ensure 

that adequate insurance protection is available to the public at a fair and reasonable 

cost and to assure the financial stability of the insurance industry so that all legitimate 

claims of the insuring public are met promptly and equally.  The IC has the regulatory 

jurisdiction over the pre-need insurance companies under Republic Act (RA) No. 

9829, the Pre-Need Code of the Philippines which was passed on December 3, 2009. 

 

On August 15, 2013, RA No. 10607 entitled “An Act Strengthening the Insurance 

Industry” was passed amending Presidential Decree No. 612, to better supervise the 

insurance industry towards its expansion and development.  The new Insurance Code 

requires increase of capital requirements for life and non-life insurance companies 

every three years until 2022. 

 

On November 12, 2015, the purview of health maintenance organizations (HMOs) was 

transferred to the IC under Executive Order (EO) No. 192. 

 

The IC has authorized plantilla positions of 345 with 193 filled positions and 42 

Contract of Service personnel as of December 31, 2020.  The IC is headed by Atty. 

Dennis B. Funa as Insurance Commissioner and assisted by four Deputy 

Commissioners for Financial Examination, Legal Services, Technical Services and 

Management Support Services, and has District Offices in Cebu and Davao, each 

headed by a Division Manager.

C. Scope and Objectives of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial accounts and operations of the IC for the year ended 

December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of assurance that 

may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial statements (b) determine 

the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, 

rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and (d) 

determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.  

 

 

D. Audit Methodology 
 

We adopted a risk-based audit approach in the audit of the financial statements (FSs) 

of the IC and in the review of compliance with laws, rules, and regulations.  The Audit 

Team which carried out the audit, among others, (i) examined financial and 

accounting procedures adopted by the IC and other relevant documentation, (ii) 

assessed internal controls regulating financial operations and carried out compliance 

testing for determining the extent of control in operation, (iii)  conducted substantive 

testing of a representative sample of selected transactions,  (iv) carried out review, on 

test check basis, of transactions related to movements in balances of assets, liabilities, 

revenues, and expenses, and (v) conducted interviews and held discussions with the 

concerned officials and staff in the Central Office.  

 

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and the 

concerned officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda.

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of presentation of IC’s 

financial statements as at December 31, 2020. 

 
F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations  

 

Among the audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in Part 

II of this report, the more significant are summarized as follows: 

 

1. Non-redemption of the 67,493 shares Series “B” of the MERALCO Preferred Stock 
totaling P674,930.00 which are no longer producing further monetary benefits since 

CY 2009 or beyond five years after issuance in CY 2004 had precluded the IC to 

use the funds for its other programs/projects/activities.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) require the Division 

Manager, Administrative Division to verify the outstanding MERALCO  

preferred shares due thereon with the MERALCO to  provide the basis for the 

request for redemption, if applicable; and (b) file the request for redemption 

of the outstanding shares with the MERALCO, as decided. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the Division 

Manager, Accounting Division to derecognize the MERALCO shares under 

Other Investments after redemption of the shares. 

 

2. Adjustments to obligations made directly on the original Obligation and Request 
Status (ORS) without the Notice of Obligation of Request and Status Adjustment 

(NORSA) did not provide complete and adequate documentation of the actual 

changes to obligations and resulted in effecting adjustments to obligations without 

the necessary certifications and approval by the concerned agency personnel. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the:  

 

a) Division Manager, Accounting Division to prepare and sign the NORSA 

in case of adjustments in the ORS, and forward the NORSA to the Budget 

Division as reference and supporting document to adjustments in the 

Registry of Allotments, Obligations and Disbursements (RAOD); and 

 

b) Division Manager, Budget Division to make a positive or negative entries 

in the Obligation column of the ORS for adjustments to obligations and in 

the RAOD upon receipt of the NORSA from the Accounting Division. 

 

3. Absence of entries in the Disbursement column of the RAOD maintained by the 
Budget Division had not enabled the monitoring of the balance of obligations to 

avoid overdraft in disbursements against obligations incurred and ensured the 

reconciliation between the related Accounting and Budget records. 



 

iv 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Division Manager, 

Budget Division to have the RAOD properly accomplished by providing 

complete details on the disbursements and unpaid obligations, among others,  

to preclude overdraft in disbursements over obligations incurred and to enable 

the reconciliation of the records of the Budget Division and Accounting 

Division. 

 

4. Disbursements from the Petty Cash Fund (PCF) without Petty Cash Vouchers 
(PCVs), non-maintenance of the Petty Cash Fund Register (PCFReg) and 

replenishments without complete and adequate documentation at the Davao District 

Office (DDO) did not provide the necessary certifications and approvals of 

disbursements from the PCF, had not facilitated the monitoring and accounting of 

the PCF, and did not provide the bases to determine that the disbursements for 

replenishment are valid and duly approved, respectively. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Division Manager, 

Davao District Office (DDO) to direct the PCF Custodian to: (a) ensure that 

the   PCV is accomplished prior to making disbursements from the PCF; and 

(b) maintain the PCFReg to monitor/summarize the PCF established/ 

replenished and the disbursements thereon; and (c) ensure that 

replenishments of the PCF submitted to IC Main Office are supported by the 

PCVs and photocopy of the PCFReg and the supporting documents. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the Division 

Manager, Accounting Division to ensure that requests for replenishments are 

processed only if supported with complete and proper documents, such as the 

PCVs, photocopy of the PCFReg, and all necessary supporting documents. 

 

The aforementioned observations and recommendations were discussed with the 

concerned agency officials in a virtual exit conference conducted on March 10, 2021 

via Cisco Webex Meeting platform.  Management’s views and comments were 

incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

 

 

G. Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges 
 

For CY 2020, two Notices of Disallowance (NDs) were issued totaling P132,853.26.

H. Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations 
  

Out of the six prior years’ audit recommendations, five were fully implemented, one 

of which matured into a Notice of Disallowance, hence included in Part II under Status 

of Settlement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges; while one was not 

implemented. The details on the status of implementation are discussed in Part III of 

this report. 

 

We enjoin Management to ensure full implementation of all audit 

recommendations to improve the financial and operational efficiency of the 

agency.
