OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

Financial Audit 

 

1. Undetermined receipt and recognition of dividends on unredeemed 67,493 shares 
Series “B”  of the MERALCO Preferred Stock totaling P674,930.00 had not 

enabled the determination of the completeness and accuracy of the balance of 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) at year-end. 

 

The terms and conditions of the Special Stock Subscription Agreement between 

the Insurance Commission (IC) and the Manila Electric Company (MERALCO) dated 

July 7, 2004 provides that an applicant for electric service shall be required to purchase 

shares of preferred stock of MERALCO in an amount equal to the total cost of the 

extension or installation  of additional facilities, which shares shall, subject to a 90-day 

notice, be redeemable at par value five years from and after issue, at the option of either 

the stockholder or MERALCO. 

 

On August 2, 2004, as consideration for the installation by  the MERALCO of 

additional electric lines and facilities to provide electric services at the IC premises, the 

IC subscribed to 67,493 shares Series “B” of MERALCO at par value of P10.00 per 

share, evidenced by the Cumulative Preferred Stock Certificate and Special Stock 

Subscription Agreement between the IC and the MERALCO. The IC paid the total 

subscription price of P674,930.00 and recognized the payment in the books under 

Other Investments. 

 

Subsequent to the confirmation with the MERALCO on the preferred shares,  a 

verbal inquiry with the Corporate Governance and Compliance Division (CGCD) 

disclosed that the said shares earn dividends during the first five years only, thus, the 

shares should have been redeemed after five years from issuance. 

 

Examination of prior  and current years’ financial statements disclosed that no 

dividends on the shares of stock have been recognized. Inquiry was also made with the 

Division Manager, Accounting Division on the receipts and recognition of dividends 

on the said MERALCO shares but no information could initially be provided. 

 

With the undetermined receipt and recognition of dividend income accruing for 

the first five years from the date of  shares’ issuance by the IC, the completeness and 

accuracy of the balance of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) at year-end was not 

determined. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Division 

Manager, Administrative Division to verify the dividends due on the outstanding 

MERALCO  preferred shares with the MERALCO to determine any claim for 

dividends. 



 

37 

 

We also recommended  and Management  agreed to require the Division 

Manager, Accounting Division (a) to verify receipts of dividends on the 

MERALCO shares to determine any outstanding claim for dividends with the 

MERALCO; and (b) to recognize dividends, if any, under Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) after receipt of the same. 

 
Compliance Issues 

 

Unredeemed MERALCO Preferred Shares of P674,930.00 

 

2. Non-redemption of the 67,493 shares Series “B”  of the MERALCO Preferred 
Stock totaling P674,930.00 which are no longer producing further monetary 

benefits since CY 2009 or  beyond five years after issuance in CY 2004 had 

precluded the IC to use the funds for its other programs/projects/activities. 
 

As of December 31, 2020, the detailed Statement of Financial Position showed 

that the account Other Investments has a balance of P674,930.00, which pertains to the 

IC’s subscription to 67,493 shares of the MERALCO’s preferred stock as consideration 

for the installation by  the MERALCO of additional electric lines and facilities in the 

IC premises and which have not yet  been redeemed. 

 

Based on the Special Stock Subscription Agreement between the IC and the 

MERALCO, the shares of preferred stock of MERALCO equivalent to the total cost of 

the extension or installation  of additional facilities are redeemable at par value five 

years from and after issue, at the option of either the stockholder or MERALCO, 

subject to a 90-day notice. 

 

Although the shares are already redeemable after five years from issuance or 

about August 2, 2009, the same have remained outstanding in the books of the IC in 

spite of having no further gains being redeemable at par value.  Confirmation with the 

CGCD of the MERALCO showed that the 67,493 shares are indeed outstanding and 

unredeemed. 

 

Inquiry with the Division Manager, Accounting Division and Supervising 

Administrative Officer, Administration Division revealed that IC is aware of the 

subscription to the MERALCO’s cumulative preferred stocks but  is not familiar with 

the provision on redemption of shares since the transaction transpired in CY 2004 or 

more than 16 years ago, as such, no actions were made as regard the redemption. 
 

As the preferred MERALCO shares remained outstanding in the books in spite 

of the lapse of the period within which dividends thereon will be paid, the equivalent 

value of the shares of P674,930.00 had not produced  further monetary benefits and 

precluded the IC to use it for other programs/projects/activities.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) require the Division 

Manager, Administrative Division to verify the outstanding MERALCO  



 

38 

 

preferred shares due thereon with the MERALCO to  provide the basis for the 

request for redemption, if applicable; and (b) file the request for redemption of 

the outstanding shares with the MERALCO, as decided. 

 

We also recommended  and Management  agreed to require the Division 

Manager, Accounting Division to derecognize the MERALCO shares under Other 

Investments after redemption of the shares. 

 
Adjustments on obligations without NORSA 

 

3. Adjustments to obligations made directly on the original ORS without the 
NORSA did not provide complete and adequate documentation of the actual 

changes to obligations and resulted in effecting adjustments to obligations without 

the necessary certifications and approval by the concerned agency personnel. 

 

Section 13, Chapter 3, Volume I of the GAM provides that adjustment of 

obligation incurred after the processing of the claim by the Accounting Division/Unit 

shall be made through the use of Notice of Obligation Request and Status Adjustment 

(NORSA). The adjustment shall be effected through a positive entry (if additional 

obligation is necessary) or a negative entry (if reduction is necessary) in the 

“Obligation” column of the Obligation Request and Status (ORS) and Registry of 

Allotments, Obligations and Disbursements (RAOD).  

 

The NORSA shall be used in adjusting the original amount obligated to the 

actual obligations incurred, and to be forwarded by the Accounting Division/Unit to 

the Budget Division/Unit for the adjustments of obligations in the RAOD. It is certified 

correct, approved and verified by the head of the requesting unit, the head of accounting 

division and the head of the budget division, respectively. Thus, the proper 

certifications and approval shall take place before adjustments to obligations in the 

original ORS can be made. 

 

The following samples of ORS, shown in Table 1, were obtained to verify the 

compliance of  the IC with the abovecited provision: 

 
Table 1 - Samples ofAdjusted ORS 

      Date ORS No. Fund Source Amount 

06/15/2020 2020-06-0475 MOOE-151 P   441,863.24 
06/29/2020 2020-06-0506 MOOE-151 1,417,906.57 
07/03/2020 2020-07-0527 MOOE-151 10,781.25 
12/21/2020 2020-12-0980 MOOE-151 189,277.89 

 

The sample ORSs showed manual erasure in the obligation with corresponding 

initial. Examination of other supporting documents attached to each ORS disclosed the 

lack of the NORSA for the adjustments made. 

 

Verification of the sample ORSs against the RAOD for Maintenance and Other 

Operating Expenses (MOOE) as of December 31, 2020 maintained in an excel file 



 

39 

 

showed that the obligations presented therein were already adjusted. There were no 

positive or negative entries to reflect the adjustments made, thus, indicating that 

adjustments were directly made to the obligations in the RAOD. 

 

Interview with the concerned personnel in the Accounting Division and Budget 

Division relative to the processing of adjustments in the ORS disclosed  that the former 

verbally informs the latter for the adjustments to be made and the latter effects the 

adjustments by either altering the original ORS or replacing the original ORS as 

adjusted. Both personnel were not familiar with the requirement to prepare the NORSA 

for adjustments to obligations. 

 

As a result, the adjustments to obligations without the NORSA did not provide 

complete and adequate documentation of the actual changes in obligations and/or audit 

trail for the same. The adjustments to obligations were effected without the necessary 

certifications and approval by the concerned agency personnel. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the:  

 

a) Division Manager, Accounting Division to prepare and sign the 

NORSA in case of adjustments in the ORS, and forward the NORSA 

to the Budget Division as reference and supporting document to 

adjustments in the RAOD; and 

 

b) Division Manager, Budget Division to make a positive or negative 

entries in the Obligation column of the ORS for adjustments to 

obligations and in the RAOD upon receipt of the NORSA from the 

Accounting Division. 

  
Incompletely accomplished RAOD 

 

4. Absence of entries in the Disbursement column of the RAOD maintained by the 
Budget Division had not enabled the monitoring of the balance of obligations to 

avoid overdraft in disbursements against obligations incurred and ensured the 

reconciliation between the related Accounting and Budget records. 

 

Section 10, Chapter 3, Volume 1of the GAM provides that the RAOD shall be 

maintained by the Budget Division/Unit of agencies to record allotments, obligations 

and disbursements. It shall show the allotments received for the year, obligations 

incurred against the corresponding allotment and the actual disbursements made. The 

balance is extracted every time an entry is made to prevent incurrence of obligations in 

excess of allotment and overdraft in disbursements against obligations incurred.  

 

Review of the RAOD-MOOE and RAOD-Personnel Services (PS) as of 

December 31, 2020 disclosed that there were no entries posted in the Disbursements 

column and consequently, no data on the unpaid obligations. Inquiry with the 

concerned Budget Division personnel revealed that the data on disbursements were 



 

40 

 

provided by the Accounting Division and directly presented in the Statement of 

Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and Balances (FAR No.1) and 

the Summary of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and Balances 

by Object of Expenditures (FAR No. 1-A), and not on the RAOD maintained by the 

Budget Division. 

 

According to the concerned Budget Division personnel, the details on 

disbursements were not provided in the Disbursement column of the RAOD because 

the Accounting Division has the complete details of the disbursements but the former 

is verbally informed of changes to obligations in the ORS by the Accounting Division. 

 

With this practice in the IC’s budgetary controls, the balance of unpaid 

obligations cannot be readily determined, since the Disbursements column did not 

present the disbursements made, making it difficult to readily monitor the balance of 

obligations, which may result in overdraft in disbursements against obligations 

incurred. Also, the practice  had not enabled the reconciliation of disbursements 

between the Disbursement Journals of the Accounting Division and the RAOD of the 

Budget Division due to sole reliance on the data provided by the Accounting Division 

instead of the Budget Division having the complete data for disbursements, for 

reconciliation with that of the Accounting Division as an additional control. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Division 

Manager,  Budget Division to have the RAOD properly accomplished by 

providing complete details on the disbursements and unpaid obligations, among 

others,  to preclude overdraft in disbursements over obligations incurred and to 

enable the reconciliation of the records of the Budget Division and Accounting 

Division.  

 
Deficiencies in the management and replenishment of the Petty Cash Fund (PCF)  

 

5. Disbursements from the PCF without PCVs, non-maintenance of the PCFReg and 
replenishments without complete and adequate documentation at the DDO did 

not provide the necessary certifications and approvals of disbursements from the 

PCF, had not facilitated the monitoring and accounting of the PCF, and did not 

provide the bases to determine that the disbursements for replenishment are valid 

and duly approved, respectively. 

 

Section 35.a, Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM provides that payments out of  

the PCF, which shall be made through a Petty Cash Voucher (PCV), should be allowed 

only for amounts not exceeding P15,000.00 for each transaction, except when a higher 

amount is allowed by law and/or specific authority by the COA. 

 

Section 41, Chapter 6, Volume I also of the GAM provides the Accounting 

Records, Forms and Reports to be prepared and maintained. The PCF Custodian 

(PCFC) shall maintain the Petty Cash Fund Register (PCFReg) to monitor/summarize 

the PCF established/replenished and the disbursements charged thereto. A photocopy 



 

41 

 

of this Register together with original PCV and its supporting documents (SDs) shall 

be submitted to the Accounting Division/Unit of the agency’s respective 

Central/Regional/ Division Office to serve as basis in the preparation of the 

Disbursement Voucher (DV) to replenish the payments made or the Journal Entry 

Voucher (JEV), at year-end, if no replenishment is made. 

 

The IC Main Office (MO) granted the PCFC a PCF of P35,000.00 to defray 

expenses for local travels, office supplies, postage and deliveries, telephone expenses 

(landline), water, electricity and other maintenance and operating expense, of the 

Davao District Office (DDO), which was recognized in the IC MO’s books under Petty 

Cash. Audit of the PCF revealed that the PCFC of the DDO does not accomplish the 

PCV as basis  for making disbursements out of the PCF.  Also, the PCFReg is not 

maintained to record and monitor the transactions of the PCF.  According to the PCFC, 

the non-maintenance of a PCFReg and the absence of PCVs prior to disbursements 

were due to the PCFC’s unfamiliarity with the requirements for the same. 

 

To replenish the payments made from the PCF, the PCFC uses only a report of 

disbursement, with invoices/receipts, among others, as its supporting documents. 

Nonetheless, the IC MO receives the requests for replenishment, which shows that it 

processes the requests for replenishment  in spite of the non-submission of the 

photocopy of the PCFReg and original PCVs with supporting documents. 

 

Examination of the replenishments of the PCF submitted by the PCFC, DDO to 

the IC MO confirmed  that only a Report of Disbursement was used to present the 

amounts and details of the replenishments, with the invoices/receipts only as the 

supporting documents. There were no PCVs and photocopy of the PCFReg, but the 

replenishments were processed by the Accounting Division. 

 

The Division Manager, Accounting Division explained that unlike the IC MO, 

the District Offices, including DDO, are manned only  by three employees, such that 

the other staff are the requestors for disbursements from the PCF and their Division 

Manager is the approving official.  Although the PCVs were not used, the Accounting 

Division ensures that the supporting documents to the replenishments of the PCF, such 

as the purchase orders and the like are approved, and the disbursement is authorized 

and duly supported, among others. Also, in lieu of the PCFReg, the Accounting 

Division  maintains and updates the subsidiary ledgers and monitors the balance of the 

Petty Cash. Nonetheless, the District Offices are now using the required form and the 

register in compliance with the COA recommendation. 

 

With disbursements from the PCF without PCVs, the necessary certifications 

and approvals on the same by the concerned personnel could not be determined.  The 

non-maintenance of the PCFReg had not facilitated the monitoring and accounting of 

the PCF, and the related disbursements and replenishments, while the processing of 

replenishments of the PCF without the photocopy of the PCFReg and PCVs had not 

provided the documentation to assess whether the disbursements for replenishment are 

valid and duly approved. 



 

42 

 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Division 

Manager, DDO to direct the PCFC to: (a) ensure that the PCV is accomplished 

prior to making disbursements from the PCF; (b) maintain the PCFReg to 

monitor/summarize the PCF established/ replenished and the disbursements 

thereon; and (c) ensure that replenishments of the PCF submitted to IC MO are 

supported by the PCVs and photocopy of the PCFReg and the supporting 

documents. 

  

We also recommended and Management agreed to require the Division 

Manager, Accounting Division to ensure that requests for replenishment are 

processed only if supported with complete and proper documents, such as the 

PCVs, photocopy of the PCFReg, and all  necessary supporting documents. 

 
Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts/Areas 

 

6. COVID-19-Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 
 

For CY 2020, the IC had not received funds specifically for Coronavirus 

Disease 2019 (COVID-19) response and/or recovery but has utilized its budget for 

related expenses.   

 

COVID-19-related expenses charged to Personnel Services (PS) and 

Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) totaled P571,500.00 and 

P3,418,373.84, respectively. The results of audit of these COVID-related transactions 

are as follows: 

 

On the provision of supplies/materials for hazard control 

 

Paragraph B, Section VI of Administrative Order (AO) No. 2020-0015 of the 

Department of Health (DOH) on Risk-based Public Health Standards Across Settings 

provides that at the minimum, all actors shall implement the prescribed interventions 

in various settings as presented under Annex A-Required Public Health Standards 

Across All Settings as of April 27, 2020, depending on their Risk Severity Grading.  

For each prescribed intervention, concrete examples of corresponding hazard controls 

(e.g. engineering control, administrative control, and PPEs.) are provided. Column D-

Offices/Workplaces of Annex A listed the administrative controls and PPE  for 

offices/workplace, such as the provision of tissue, masks,  among others.  On the other 

hand,engineering  and administrative controls include placement of handwashing 

facilities, hand sanitizers and dispensers with alcohol-based solution in all entrances, 

exits and areas with high foot traffic and facilities. 

 

Whereas, Paragraph B, Section VII of the same AO provides that national 

government agencies shall develop and submit their sector-specific plans and 

guidelines on the operationalization of the risk-based public health standards to the 

DOH. 



 

43 

 

The IC issued Office Circular No. 2020-006 dated May 10, 2020 on the Interim 

Administrative Protocols in the lnsurance Commission During the Community 

Quarantine in the Philippines Due to COVID-19 Pandemic. The said office circular 

provides specific guidelines in compliance with the aforesaid provisions of  said DOH 

AO. 

 

Review of account Other Supplies and Materials Inventory as of December 31, 

2020 disclosed various procurements from the Procurement Service and other suppliers 

of other supplies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to include alcogel, facemask 

and face shield on top of the regular supplies given such as tissue and alcohol. For 

Other Supplies and Materials Expenses, the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued 

(RSMI) attached to JEVs disclosed that the said other supplies were given to all IC 

officials and employees on a quarterly basis, which as at year-end had a total cost of 

P1,115,177.15. 

 

 Also, three wash bin bowls totaling P12,599.25 were procured to serve as the 

hand-washing station, of which two were located near the main entrance and one at the 

rear entrance of the IC premises. 

 

 On the provision of transportation facilities to employees on skeleton workforce  

 

Item C, Section 4.0 of Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular 

(MC) No. 18, s. 2020 states that reasonable transportation facilities and housing 

quarters shall be provided to employees assigned as skeleton workforce, whenever 

practicable, and subject to budgeting, accounting and auditing rules and regulations. 

 

The IC entered into various Job Orders (JOs) for the weekly lease of van/s to 

transport personnel on skeleton worforce, which as at year-end had a total cost of 

P2,108,097.44. Inquiry with the Division Manager, Administrative Division handling 

the logistics of leased van/s disclosed that this approach is the most responsive to the 

needs of IC employees, since the office order for authorized IC employees on skeleton 

workforce is being prepared at least weekly, due to the different timing of submission 

by each functional group of the  list of personnel on skeleton workforce. Hence, to 

maximize the use of the leased van/s and to adapt to the number and location of 

authorized IC employees who will avail of the vans on specified dates, the van/s were 

leased on a weekly basis. 

 

On the grant of  hazard pay to employees during the ECQ 

 

Section 1 of AO No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 of the Office of the President 

authorized the national government agencies (NGAs) to grant COVID-19 Hazard Pay 

to personnel who physically reported for work during the implementation of Enhanced 

Community Quarantines in their respective work stations, in an amount not exceeding 

P500.00 per day per person. 

 



 

44 

 

Section 2 of the same AO provides the conditions on the grant of the COVID-

19 Hazard Pay and that the heads of government agencies may grant the COVID-19 

Hazard Pay to their personnel/workers without the need for further approval by the 

Department of Budget and Management (DBM), subject to the following guidelines 

and conditions:  

 

1. The personnel are occupying regular, contractual or casual positions, or are 
workers engaged through Contract of Service (COS), job order (JO), or other 

similar schemes. 

 

2. The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work at 
their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official working 

hours by the head of agency/office during the period of implementation of 

Enhanced Community Quarantine measures in the area of such office or work 

station. 

 

3. The total rate of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay shall be based on the number of 
days an employee/worker physically reports for work during the Enhanced 

Community Quarantine (ECQ) period using the formula under Section 1, 

which is P500 x No. of days physically reporting for work during the 

quarantine period. 

 

Review of the transactions recognized under accounts Hazard Pay and Other 

Maintenance and Operating Expenses for CY 2020 disclosed that the IC granted 

COVID-19 hazard pay at P500/day to 141 IC regular/plantilla officials and employees 

and 33 COS/Service Agreement (SA) personnel totaling P571,500.00 and P182,500.00, 

respectively, who reported to office during the ECQ (March 17 to May 15, 2020 ) and 

Modified ECQ (MECQ) (May 16 to 31, 2020 and  August 4 to 18, 2020).  

 

Verification of the relevant DVs on the grant of hazard pay showed that the 

payments were supported with office order/s of  IC employees including COS/SA 

personnel authorized to work during the ECQ and MECQ, Daily Time Records (DTRs) 

and summary of all IC personnel who actually rendered service as Skeleton Work Force 

during the ECQ and MECQ. 

 
Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

7. Delays in the submission of the GPB and AR for CY 2020 by 250 and 33 days, 
respectively, had not facilitated the timely review of the same and of the 

implementation of the IC GAD programs and activities for CY 2020, among 

others. 

 

Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 provides that 

the audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to 

the COA Audit Team within five working days from the receipt of the approved plan 

from the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) or their mother or central offices, 



 

45 

 

as the case may be. Likewise, a copy of the corresponding Accomplishment Report 

(AR) shall be furnished the said Audit Team within five working days from the end of 

January of the succeeding year. 

 

Section B.3, COA Circular No. 2014-001 provides that the result of audit, if 

material, shall be among the basis in determining the fairness of presentation in the 

FSs. 

 

The Audit Team made several verbal follow-ups with the concerned GAD 

members for the submission of the GPB and GAD AR for CY 2020 and was informed 

that the delay in the submission was due to the lack of awareness of newly appointed 

GADFPS on the dates of submission of the GAD-related documents. 

 

The GPB and GAD AR for CY 2020, which should be submitted on the 5th day 

from receipt of the approved plan from PCW on July 8, 2020 and February 5, 2021, 

respectively, were both submitted to COA only on  March 10, 2021 or  with delays of 

250 and 33 days, respectively. 

 

Due to the delays in the submission of the GPB and GAD AR, the audits of the 

same and the GAD PAPs for CY 2020 were not performed in a timely manner, limiting 

the audit procedures that should have determined any effect  of the related 

disbursements for activities implemented on the fairness of the presentation of the FSs. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the GAD 

Chairperson to ensure strict adherence to the prescribed due dates for submission 

of the GPB, GAD AR and the related supporting documents. 

 
8. Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability (PWD) 

 

In compliance with Section 32, General Provisions of the General 

Appropriations Act, FY 2020, the IC provided a restroom for Senior Citizens and PWD, 

in addition to the existing courtesy lanes in the Cashier’s Office for senior citizens, and 

PWD-paying clientele, and two ramps in the entrance (front and back) of the IC 

building for PWD clients. 

 
9. Tax Laws and Regulations, GSIS and Pag-IBIG Premium Contributions and 

Loan Amortizations, and PhilHealth Premium Contributions 

 

The IC complied with the existing laws and regulations on the withholding and 

remittance of taxes and mandatory personnel deductions pursuant to the regulations 

issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), Government Service Insurance 

System (GSIS), Pag-IBIG, and PhilHealth. Details in Table 2 on the next page:

Pursuant to Section 5 of Republic Act No. 656, otherwise known as the Property 

Insurance Law, the IC paid insurance premiums of P233,849.51 with the General 

Insurance Fund of the GSIS for all of its insurable assets and properties totaling 

P74,782,303.02 for CY 2020. 

 
11. Hiring of Casuals, JOs, Contractuals and Consultants 

 

Section 6.2.1 of COA-DBM Joint Circular (JC) No. 2, s. 2020 dated October 

20, 2020 provides that the term of contract between the agency and the individual 

contractor shall be for a maximum period of one year, renewal at the option of the Head 

of the Procuring Entity (HOPE) but in no case shall exceed the term of the latter. 
 

Section 11.1 provides that agencies may engage the services of new COS/JO 

workers through individual contract and renew the individual contracts of their existing 

COS/JO workers until December 31, 2022. 
 

Section 11.3 of the same JC provides that existing qualified COS/JO workers 

shall be considered for appointment by the government agencies to their vacant 

positions subject to existing civil service laws, rules, and regulations, as well as the 

CSC-approved Merit Selection Plan of the agency. 
 

Verification of the submitted COS revealed that for CY 2020, the IC entered 

into six new agreements and renewed the contracts of 36 COS personnel, to augment 

its workforce for a period of one year until December 31, 2020 and within the term of 

the HOPE.  



 

47 

 

Based on the schedule of COS personnel who assumed plantilla positions as of 

December 31, 2020 submitted by the Human Resource Division, which was likewise 

verified with the submitted contracts and with the IC plantilla as of December 31, 2020, 

14 COS personnel received their respective approved appointment and are currently 

holding a plantilla item of the IC.
