PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
Financial Audit  

   
Accounting Errors and Omissions  

 
1. The asset and equity accounts of the National Research Center of the 
Philippines (NRCP) had misstatements totaling ₱114,895,589.20 and ₱4,323,006.24, 
respectively, which represent 54.68 percent and 3.18 percent of its total assets and 

equity, correspondingly. Due to the significant impact of such misstatements on the 

reported balances of the affected accounts, Management’s assertions as to the 

accuracy, existence, classification and completeness of the said accounts could not be 

relied upon.  

 

2. Paragraph 15 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 
and Section 3, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, states 
that “Financial statements are a structured representation of the financial position and 
financial performance of an entity. The objectives of general purpose financial statements 
are to provide information about the financial position, financial performance and cash 
flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making and evaluating decisions 
about the allocation of resources.” The standards further states that specifically, the 
objectives of the general purpose financial reporting in the public sector should be to 
provide information useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the accountability of 
the entity for the resources entrusted to it. 

 
3. Paragraph 27 of IPSAS 1 provides that Financial Statements (FSs) shall present 
fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair 
presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, 
and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, 
liabilities, revenue and expenses set out in IPSASs. The application of IPSASs, with 
additional disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in FSs that achieve a fair 
presentation. 

 
4. Moreover, Sections 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 requires 
agencies to keep the accounts in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency 
and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control 
agencies of the government; and that the highest standard of honesty, objectivity and 
consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate 
and misleading information. Each government agency shall record its financial transactions 
and operations conformably with IPSAS and in accordance with pertinent laws and 
regulations. 
 
5. Our audit revealed various accounting errors/omissions resulting in misstatements 
in account balances reported in the FSs of the NRCP and affecting Management’s 
assertions that all transactions and events: should be recorded and have been recorded

a)  Misclassification of receivable accounts- ₱49,536,080.47   
 

6. The NRCP transfers funds to other National Government Agencies (NGAs), Non-
Government Organizations (NGOs)/People’s Organizations (POs), and various 
private institutions or Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) or private individuals such 
as the Research Development Leaders (RDLs), for the implementation of basic 
research under its Grant-in-Aid (GIA) Program. The fund transfers (FTs) are 
covered with a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) which identifies the NRCP as 
the source agency (SA) and the recipient government agencies, NGOs/POs and 
private institutions to which the RDL is connected as implementing agencies (IAs). 

 
7. Chapter 3 of the GAM, Volume III, provides the description of the following 
accounts: 

 
 Due from National Government Agencies (10303010) is used to recognize advances 

for purchases of goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers to the NGAs 
for implementation of projects and other receivables from NGAs. Credit this 
account upon receipt of goods/services, and liquidation of fund 
transfers/receivables. 

 
 Due from Non-Government Organizations/People's Organizations (10305030) is 

used to recognize amount of advances granted to Non-Government Organizations 
(NGOs)/People’s Organizations (POs) for implementation of specific projects. 
Credit this account for liquidation of advances. 

 
 Other Receivables (10305990) is used to recognize amount due from debtors and 

other agencies not falling under any of the specific receivable account. This also 
includes receivables from individuals or entities intended for specific projects or 
purpose not falling under any of the specific receivable account. Credit this account 
for payment/liquidation of receivables. 

  
8. Examination of the Due from NGAs and Other Receivables accounts showed the 
following observations:  
                                                          

 Due from NGAs account included funds transferred to a foundation and private 
individuals for the implementation of its research projects amounting to 
₱38,960,473.66 as shown in Table 2.

9. The lack of prudent monitoring-analysis of the transactions involved resulted in the 
misclassification of accounts which runs counter to the GAM, Volume III; thus, overstating 
Due from NGAs by P36,055,455.71 and understating Due from NGOs/POs and Other 
Receivables accounts by P18,439,347.93 and P17,616,107.78, respectively. 

 
10. We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. require the Accountant to reclassify the affected accounts namely: Due 
from NGAs, Due from NGOs/POs and the Other Receivables to present the 

correct nature of the accounts in the FS; and 
 

b. henceforth, observe consistency in the keeping of the accounts to 
safeguard against inaccurate and misleading information. 

 
b) Outright charging to expense account - ₱800,000.00 

  
11. Section 20 of the GAA, provides that all agencies of the government shall purchase 
its common-use supplies requirements from Procurement Service (PS) as mandated under 
LOI No. 755 dated October 18, 1978, EO No. 359, AO No. 17, s. 2011 and such other 
guidelines issued thereon. 
 
12. The NRCP expended a total of ₱1,297,863.38 for Travelling Expenses as of 
December 31, 2020. The amount included advance payment of ₱800,000.00 to PS – DBM 



45 
 

for its government fares agreement (GFA); and the procured airline tickets of ₱235,150.00 
from the three travel agencies. 

 
13. The procurement from travel agencies were used for the official travels of various 
NRCP employees, consultants, resource speakers and other guests for seminars, trainings 
and conferences.    
 
14. Airline tickets are one of the most commonly-requested items in the procurement 
activities of government agencies. In fact, the Procurement Service (PS), an attached 
agency of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), had listed airline tickets in 
its catalog as one of the Common-use Supplies and Equipment (CSE). It’s for this purpose 
that the DBM has adopted a “whole-of-government” approach in procuring airline tickets.  
 
15. In connection with that, the NRCP entered into a fare agreement with the PS-DBM 
for their airfare tickets requirements. For CY 2020 a total amount of ₱800,000.00 was paid 
to the PS-DBM as advance payment for the airfare tickets.  Examination revealed that 
Management inadvertently effected this amount by directly charging it to Travelling 
Expense account, instead of debiting Due from NGAs - PS-DBM account.  The direct 
charging to expense account of the advance payment resulted in the overstatement of 
Travelling Expense and the understatement of Due from NGAs - PS-DBM, both accounts 
of the same amount, respectively.  

 
16. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

 

a. make the necessary adjusting entry by debiting Due from NGAs (PS- 
DBM) account and crediting Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account; and  

 

b. stop the practice of directly charging to expense account any advance 
payment to the PS-DBM.  

 
c) Non-reclassification of the completed building – ₱21,792,338.89 

 
17. Our previous year’s finding showed that the account Construction in Progress 
(CIP) - Office Building with a General Ledger (GL) balance of ₱21,792,338.89 as at 
December 31, 2020 pertained to the total cost for the construction of the NRCP building 
that has not yet been turned over due to some finishing touches to be completed by the 
Contractor.  Although abandoned by the Contractor, the building has been occupied and 
used by the NRCP since 2014, with the NRCP neither seeking any legal action against the 
Contractor nor recommending to the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) that 
the Contractor be blacklisted.  Hence, aggravating the non-reclassification of the CIP to its 
proper specific account that consequently overstated and understated the affected accounts.  
Likewise, the corresponding depreciation for the said asset has not been recognized as 
required in Sections 8 and 27, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I, to wit:    

 
18. Section 8 –  

 



46 
 

“Construction of PPE. During the construction period, all expenses incurred 
in relation to the construction of the PPE shall be taken up in the books as 
Construction in Progress (CIP) with the appropriate asset classification. As 
soon as the construction is completed, the “Construction in Progress” 
account shall be reclassified to the proper asset account” 
 
Section 27 –   
 
“PPE gradually loses its ability to provide service over the course of time. 
Because of this, its cost needs to be distributed on a systematic basis over its 
useful life. The allocated cost is referred to as depreciation. The depreciation 
charge for each period shall be recognized as expense unless it is included in 
the carrying amount of another asset. 

 
19. Management has been consistently trying to communicate with the Contractor but 
no response was received. The Notice of Termination was issued only in 2018 or four (4) 
years after the abandonment of the project. With this delay, Management has been hesitant 
to issue a blacklisting order as it seemed no longer feasible. 

 
20. We reiterated our recommendation and Management agreed to require the 
Accountant to: 

 

a. reclassify the Construction-in-Progress to Office Building account to reflect 
the correct balance of the account in the FS; 
 

b. provide depreciation for the years the building has been used; and 
 

c. issue a Blacklisting Order, if applicable, to be submitted along with the 
Delisting Order to the GPPB, within seven (7) days after its issuance 

pursuant to the Uniform Guidelines for Blacklisting of Contractors. 
 

d) Misclassification of expense accounts - ₱3,523,006.24 
 

21. The NRCP engaged the professional services of private consultants or project 
leaders for their individual expertise to implement its various basic research projects.  The 
said undertakings are covered with Contracts of Service or Memoranda of Agreement 
(MOAs) which identifies the NRCP as the Implementing Agency (IA). 

 
22. Chapter 3 of the GAM, Volume III provides the description of the following 
accounts: 
 

 Consultancy Services (50211030) is used to recognize the cost of services rendered 
by consultants contracted to perform particular outputs or services primarily 
advisory in nature and requiring highly specialized or technical expertise which 
cannot be provided by the regular staff of the agency. 

 



47 
 

 Other Professional Services (50211990) is used to recognize the cost of other 
professional services contracted by the agency not otherwise classified under any 
of the specific professional services accounts.  

 

23. Further, Section 5 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations 
(RIRR) of Republic Act (RA) 9184 provides, Consulting Services as services for 
infrastructure projects and other types of projects or activities of the Government of the 
Philippines (GoP) requiring adequate external technical and professional expertise that are 
beyond the capability and/or capacity of the GoP to undertake such as, but not limited to: 
(i) advisory and review services; (ii) pre-investment or feasibility studies; (iii) design; (iv) 
construction supervision; (v) management and related services; and (vi) other technical 
services or special studies.  
                                                  
24. The Other Professional Services expense account includes payment of the salaries 
of Contractual personnel and payments to various Consultants and RDLs which were hired 
for their individual field of expertise, for the implementation of the various basic research 
projects of NRCP. 

 
25. Payments showed that the Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) were supported with 
either the tripartite MOA between the NRCP, the selected Higher Education Institutes 
(HEIs) and the RDL, or the Contract of Service of consultants with Terms of Reference 
(TOR) and deliverables.  RDLs were hired by the NRCP for their individual fields of 
expertise and payments were made/released to them in two or three tranches ranging from 
20% to 50% of the contract cost as stipulated in the MOA.  Moreover, advance payments 
were made/released upon the perfection of the contract. Hence, the transactions were 
consultancy in nature, not to mention that the approved budget for Other Professional 
Services (OPS) did not cover the amount disbursed for the payment to consultants and 
RDLs. As such, said payments should have been appropriately charged to the Consultancy 
Services account. This showed the Accountant’s lack of prudent analysis/scrutiny in the 
classification of expenses and non-consideration of the approved budget of the targeted 
account. 

 
26. Payment to consultants and RDLs amounted to ₱3,523,006.24 that were debited to 
the account Other Professional Services rather than Consultancy Services, which 
contradicts the aforementioned provision of the GAM, Volume III resulting in the 
overstatement and understatement of the Other Professional Services and the Consultancy 
Services accounts, respectively, by the same amount.  

 

27. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant: 
 

a. to reclassify the affected accounts, namely: Other Professional Services and 
Consultancy Services to present the correct nature of the accounts in the 

FS; and  

 



48 
 

b. thereafter, to confer with the Budget Officer on similar transactions 
requiring prudent analysis/scrutiny, if within the approved budget of the 

targeted account, before any payment can be made. 

 

28. In summary, the total misstatements of Due from NGAs, Due from NGOs/COs, 
Other Receivables, Building and CIP-Building accounts amounting to P114,895,589.20, 
represent 54.68 percent of the agency’s total assets, while misstatements of Net 
Assets/Equity amounting to P4,323,006.24 represent 3.18 percent of its total amount.  Due 
to the significant impact of these misstatements on the financial statements, we rendered a 
Qualified Opinion on the financial statements of the NRCP as at year-end. 
 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

Improper classification and recording of fund transfers - ₱48,741,447.46 
 

29. Fund transfers to various Implementing Agencies/project leaders amounting 
to ₱48,741,447.46 were recorded as Subsidy-Others expense account upon payment 

but with semestral adjustments of reverting to Due from NGAs or Other Receivables 

accounts, contrary to Section 109, Chapter 1 of PD 1445 and Chapter 3 of the GAM 

Volume III; thus, the Financial Statements (FS) are not fairly presented at a given 

time.  

 

30. Section 109, Chapter 1 of PD 1445 provides that Government accounting 
encompasses the processes of analyzing recording, classifying, summarizing and 
communicating all transactions involving the receipt and disposition of government funds 
and property, and interpreting the results thereof. 
 
31. Chapter 3 of the GAM, Volume III provides the description of Due from NGAs 
account, as already provided in the above observations, and Subsidies-Others account as: 

 
Subsidies-Others (50214990) is used to recognize the financial assistance 
given to individuals and institutions other than government agencies or 
NGOs/POs for government programs/projects/activities. This account shall be 
closed to the Revenue and Expense Summary account. 

 

32. Fund transfers (FTs) to various Implementing Agencies/project leaders amounting 
to ₱48,741,447.46 were recorded as Subsidies-Others upon payment, but with semestral 
adjustments of reverting to Due from NGAs or Other Receivables. Verification of the 
various DVs issued showed that the payments were releases to IAs/recipients for the grants 
on the implementation of NRCP Grant-in-Aid projects. 
 
33. Inquiry with the Accountant disclosed that they were only following the object code 
(as expense) as suggested by the Budget Officer based on the issued Budget Utilization 
Request and Status (BURS).  Eventually at the end of every semester, the account 
Subsidies-Others was being reverted to either Due from NGAs or Other Receivables 
accounts to establish accountability. 



49 
 

 
34. The fact that there is a semestral adjustment of the fund transfers is an admission 
of error in the classification pursuant to the GAM, Volume III.  The corrective measure of 
recording the fund transfers to Due from NGAs or Other Receivables accounts should not 
only be effected in the Accounting records, but also with the Budget documents since the 
latter became the basis of the Accountant in recording the FTs as Subsidies-Others. The 
improper treatment of fund transfers affected the fair presentation of the FS of the NRCP 
at a given time. 

 
35. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant, in 
coordination with the Budget Officer, to practice a careful analysis of the transactions 

to come up with an accurate classification in order to present the correct nature of 

the accounts in the FS. 

 

Compliance audit 

 

Unreliable balance of Cash in Bank – LCCA - ₱436,035.45 
 

36. The Cash in Bank - Local Currency Current Account (LCCA) account with 
GL balance of ₱436,035.45 cannot be ascertained due to: (a) non-preparation of Bank 

Reconciliation Statement (BRS), resulting in a variance of ₱512,560.71 between the 

book and bank balances, which is not in accordance with Section 3, Chapter 21 of the 

GAM, Volume I; and (b) collections from different sources maintained in the bank 

by the NRCP were not remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr), contrary to 

Section 2 of Executive Order No. 338, thus, affecting the fair presentation of the Cash 

in Bank balance in the FS and impeding the use of funds for other government 

projects.  

 
37. Section 3, Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I provides that the Bank Reconciliation 
Statement (BRS) shall be prepared in order to: (a) check correctness of both the bank’s and 
agency’s/entity’s records, (b) serve as a deterrent to fraud, and (c) enable the agency/entity 
or bank to take up charges or credits recognized by the bank or agency/entity but not yet 
known to the agency/entity or bank.  

 
38. Section 74 of PD 1445 requires the head of the agency to see to it that reconciliation 
is made between the balance shown in the monthly reports of depositories (bank 
statements) and the balance found in the books of the agency.  COA Circular No. 92-125A 
dated March 4, 1992 requires the Accountant to prepare the Bank Reconciliation 
Statements (BRS) based on the bank statements from the bank and submit the same within 
15 days after the end of each month to the Auditor concerned. 
 
39. Verification of the account Cash in Bank - LCCA of NRCP amounting to 
₱436,035.45 as at December 31, 2020, revealed the following: 

 
 
 



50 
 

a) Non-preparation of BRS, resulted in variance of ₱512,560.71 
 

40. The NRCP maintains a current bank account with the Land Bank of the Philippines 
with the confirmed bank balance of ₱948,596.16 vis-à-vis agency’s book balance of 
₱436,035.45 as at December 31, 2020 resulting in a P512,560.71 variance, the details of 
which are shown in Table 4.

 Total ₱436,035.45 948,596.16 512,560.71 
 

41. The noted variance between the book and bank balances of ₱512,560.71 cannot be 
determined due to non-preparation of BRS.  Said error could have been detected and 
balances could have been reconciled if the Accountant had prepared the BRS pursuant to 
the above regulations. 
 
42. The Accountant did not prepare the BRS for this account for the reason that the 
account was already dormant and was intended to be closed. 

 
43. The non-preparation of BRS resulted in a material amount of variance between the 
book and bank balances of Cash in Bank - LCCA account, affecting its fair presentation in 
the FS. 

 
b) Collections not remitted to BTr - ₱436,035.45 

 
44. Section 2 of Executive Order (EO) No. 338 provides that “all government offices 
and agencies are hereby required to immediately transfer all public moneys deposited with 
depository banks and other institutions to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTR), regardless of 
income source.” 
 

45. Section 4 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA provides that as a general 
rule, all fees, charges, assessments, and other receipts or revenues collected by 
departments, bureaus and offices of the National Government, including Constitutional 
Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy in the exercise of their mandated functions, at such rates 
as are now or may be approved by the appropriate approving authority shall be deposited 
with the National Treasury as income of the General Fund. 
  
46. It can be gleaned on the above Table that the book balance of ₱436,035.45 consists 
of trust receipts balances on the collection of grant received from IDRC and the registration 
fees during the 17th Scientific Conference of Asia dated 1 June 2017, held in Pasay City. 
 



51 
 

47. The wisdom of regulating government cash balances by the National Treasury boils 
down to the urgent fiscal decision of the government to properly dispose of the available 
funds; hence, the continued practice of non-remittance to the National Treasury of the trust 
receipts may adversely affect fiscal governance of our country and we find the NRCP not 
compliant with Section 2 of Executive Order No. 338 and Section 4 of the General 
Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA which states that all government offices and agencies are 
required to immediately transfer all public moneys deposited at any Authorized 
Government Depository Bank (AGDB) to the BTr for funds can be used for other 
government projects . 

 
48. Management commented that the balance was the partial released fund from 
pending/uncompleted project of IDRC and no instructions were given to them by the source 
agency to close the account despite being dormant, therefore, the balance was not 
immediately reverted to the BTr. 
 

49. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 
 

a. prepare the BRS and determine the reconciling items and record the same 
in the books to reflect the correct balance of the account in the FS;  

 

b. effect the immediate transfer of the bank balance of the account to the 
BTr pursuant to the afore-cited provisions of laws, rules and regulations 

and the compliance thereafter; and 
 

c. make the necessary coordination with the LBP for the closing of the 
account. 

 
Unliquidated fund transfers for completed research projects- ₱46,791,795.50 
 
50. Fund transfers totaling ₱46,791,795.50 recorded under the accounts Due from 
NGAs, and Other Receivables remained unliquidated due to inadequate project 

monitoring, particularly on the submission of Financial Reports (FRs) and refund of 

unexpended balances, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 

1994, and DOST Administrative Order No. 009 series of 2017. Further, Other 

Receivables account includes fund transfer to undocumented research grants 

amounting to ₱1,806,579.50 to 18 private individuals. 

 
51. As at December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of receivable accounts consists 
of Due from NGAs and Other Receivables accounts amounting ₱82,544,667.95 and 
₱28,353,915.67, respectively, or a total of ₱110,898,583.62.  These balances account for 
the funds transferred by the NRCP to various NGAs/NGOs/POs/private entities/ 
individuals for the research grant which remained unliquidated at year-end.  

 
Analysis of the accounts revealed the following deficiencies: 
 



52 
 

a) Unliquidated fund transfers pertaining to completed research grants-  
₱46,791,795.50 

 
52. The fund transfers (FTs) are subject to the provisions of DOST Administrative 
Order (AO) No. 005, series of 2013, which sets forth the guidelines for the Grants-in-Aid 
(GIA) funds of the DOST and its attached agencies.  The GIA program provides grants for 
the implementation of programs/projects identified in the current DOST priorities and 
thrusts and supports S&T activities classified in the General Appropriations Act. 

 
53. The AO under Section 6.3.3.2 provides that for liquidation purposes, the Project 
Leader duly noted by the Head of the Agency or designated/authorized representative shall 
submit Financial Report (FR) certified by the agency accountant on grants received within 
two months after the end of every year for government agency as implementing agency. 
For NGOs or privately-owned institutions, the annual audited financial report (AFR) shall 
be submitted certified by a licensed independent accountant with an Audit Certificate 
Report.  A Terminal AFR shall be submitted within three (3) months after the completion 
of the project, both for government and private entity as proponents. 

 
54. While Section 6.3.4.e of the same AO provides that upon project completion/ 
termination, all balances/savings and income/interest shall be reported and reverted to the 
Funding Agency within three (3) months after the end of project period. 

 
55. Moreover, Section 6.3.6 states that the standard procedure in case of non-
submission of requirements by the Project Leader which states that for failure to submit 
within six (6) months the required financial, technical and other reports after the prescribed 
deadlines, a demand letter shall be sent to the Project Leader and Head of Agency of the 
IA.  Upon the recommendation of the Monitoring Agency, the Project Leader is prevented 
from receiving further grants or any kind of support from within the DOST System until 
he/she is cleared from all obligations pertinent to the previous GIA grant.   

 
56. In addition, COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 covers the rules 
and regulations in the grant, utilization and liquidation of funds transferred to IAs to ensure 
that the transfer is properly taken up in the books of the Source Agency (SA) and 
Implementing Agency (IA) and used only for the intended purpose and that proper 
accounting and reporting is made of the utilization of the funds. 

  
57. Verification revealed that the receivable balances at year-end totaling 
₱46,791,795.50 or 43 percent pertains to unliquidated balances of FTs for research grants 
that were already completed from CYs 2004 up to 2020, as summarized in Table 5.

Total 110,898,583.62 46,791,795.50 43% 



53 
 

 
58. Had Management pursued liquidations from NGAs and Implementing Agencies 
(IAs)/private individuals, the receivable balance could have been lessened and as a result 
of the submission of documents of various research grants, Management may be guided in 
selecting appropriate researches needing support from the government. 

 
59. Furthermore, FT balances for completed researches/grants were unliquidated for 
the period ranging from less than one year up to more than 16 years, as shown in Table 6.

60. As shown in Table 6, the balance of ₱561,429.09 had been outstanding for 11 to 16 
years, without any refund or liquidation made in CY 2020. 

 
61. The existence of long outstanding balances attributed to the inadequate monitoring 
by the concerned Project Officers/Division Chiefs to exercise sound and strong judgment 
to constrain the Project Leaders to submit liquidation documents to avoid the perennial 
problem of unliquidated FTs due to weak enforcement of the aforementioned DOST AO 
and COA Circular, especially the provision of the DOST AO on the standard procedure in 
case of non-submission of requirements by the Project Leader that for failure to submit 
within six months the required financial, technical and other reports after the prescribed 
deadlines, a demand letter shall be sent to the Project Leader and Head of Agency of the 
IA.  Further, it states that the Funding Agency (FA) may undertake legal measures against 
the Project Leader for non-submission of requirements. 
 

b) Researchers without records on file - ₱1,806,579.50 
 
62. Other Receivables account includes 18 IAs/recipient researchers with an 
unliquidated fund transfer amounting to ₱1,806,579.50, found to be without records on file 
or no date of completion stated in the schedule.  These FTs were granted to the recipients 
from CYs 2005 to 2015 aged ranging from 4 to 15 years of unliquidated funds.  Query 
from the accounting office personnel disclosed that these unliquidated fund transfers have 
long been in the books of the NRCP long before their employment at the agency in CY 
2017. The absence of records on file of the recipient of the grants resulted in lesser chance 
to recover the unliquidated FTs and the liability of the recipients was not fully established. 
This has been observed in the prior years and was earlier reported in the CY 2019 audit 
report. 



54 
 

 

63. The inadequate monitoring of FTs resulted in: (1) accumulation of long-outstanding 
FTs in the books of accounts; (2) unused balances not reverted to the Source Agency; (3) 
lost supporting documents; (4) control lapses; and (5) the impression that research/grant 
were not completed with the possibility of misuse of GIA funds. 
 

64. We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations and Management agreed to 
require: 

 

a. Project Officers/Division Chiefs to regularly and closely monitor the 
research grants which were subject of FTs and strictly enforce the 

provisions of DOST AO No. 005 on the reporting requirements for the 

grants, not only on the submission of technical reports but also of the 

financial reports; 

 

b. Project Division personnel to send demand letters to IAs/project leaders, 
stating definite deadlines and the possible blacklisting/legal actions that 

may be instigated against them in case of non-compliance to exhaust all 

possible remedies to compel the IAs/private individuals to liquidate their 

long-outstanding balances; and 

 

c. Project Officers/Division Chiefs to exert effort in locating those supporting 
documents that were not on file to establish the liability of the recipients 

and its whereabouts.  

 

Fund transfers without Official Receipts - ₱26,128,515.00 
 

65. Fund Transfers to NGAs amounting to ₱26,128,515.00 with prepared DVs 
were not properly documented, which is not in accordance with Section 4 of PD 1445, 

thus, transactions are doubtful. 

 

66. Item 6, Section 4 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 (PD 1445) states that “Claims 
against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.” 

 
67. Verification of the DVs on the FTs to 11 NGAs, which were released through an 
Advice/Authority to Debit Account (ADA), lacked the primary supporting documents such 
as the Official Receipts (ORs) in violation of Item 6, Section 4 of PD 1445.  Management 
averred that these were the late ORs coming from the NGAs located in the Visayas and 
Mindanao.  Nonetheless, the weak resolve of Management on the strict compliance with 
documentation requirements kept the transactions doubtful due to incomplete 
documentation. 

 
68. We recommended and Management agreed to enjoin the Accountant/ Project 
Leaders/Division Heads to require the recipients of grants to submit the needed ORs 

for proper documentation of the transactions to avoid future disallowance in audit. 

 

 



55 
 

Unreliable PPE balance – ₱36,124,827.24 
 

69. The accuracy and reliability of the PPE accounts balance of ₱67,440,842.42   
could not be ascertained due to: (a) discrepancies of ₱36,124,827.24 between the GL 

balances and the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) attributable to: (i) 

dropped balances of the unserviceable PPE in the property records; and (ii) lack of 

regular reconciliation between accounting and property records; and (b) non-

disposal of unserviceable PPEs amounting to ₱5,906,806.86. 

  

70. International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 17 prescribes the 
standards on the recognition, measurement, depreciation, impairment, derecognition and 
disclosure requirements dealing with transactions and events affecting property, plant and 
equipment of the public sector so that users of the financial statements can discern 
information about an entity’s investment in its PPE and the changes in such investment. 

 
71. As at December 31, 2020, the NRCP’s PPE accounts amounted to ₱67,440,842.42, 
with net book value of ₱37,598,402.21, as presented in Table 7.

72. Analysis of the PPEs revealed the following deficiencies/errors which affected the 
determination of accuracy and reliability of the reported balances: 

 

 

 



56 
 

a.   Discrepancy between accounting and property records – ₱36,124,827.24 
 
73. Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I, requires that: “The entity shall have 
a periodic physical count of PPE, shall be done annually and presented on the Report on 
the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) (Appendix 73) as at 
December 31, of each year.  This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than 
January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during 
the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper 
accounting/recording”. (emphasis ours) 

 
74. Moreover, Section 42 of the same manual also states that the Chief Accountant 
shall maintain Property Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) for each category of 
PPE. PPELC shall be kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, 
estimated useful life, depreciation, impairment loss, disposal and other information about 
the asset. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise 
maintain Property Card (PC) for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and 
disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained 
by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property records 
like Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR). (emphasis ours) 

 
75. Verification of accounting and property records showed the GL balances of various 
PPE accounts totaling ₱67,440,842.42 were not reconciled with the RPCPPE prepared by 
the Supply and Maintenance Section with only ₱31,316,015.18 total balance, resulting in 
a substantial difference of ₱36,124,827.24, as shown in Table 8:

57 
 

 
76. One of the attributable causes of the above variance is the non-inclusion of balances 
of the unserviceable property in the RPCPPE. In the conduct of the physical count, the 
Supply Office personnel prepared a separate list for PPE inventory found to be 
unserviceable during the physical count instead of using the Inventory and Inspection 
Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP). The immediate exclusion of the identified 
unserviceable property from the RPCPPE contributed to the variance between accounting 
and property records.   

 
77. Moreover, the perennial lack of regular reconciliation between the accounting and 
property offices’ records resulted in undetected variance of ₱36,124,827.24; thus, casting 
doubt on the existence of PPE as well the accuracy of the PPE account balances as at 
December 31, 2020.  

 
78. We recommended and Management agreed to require:  
 

a. The Supply Officer to conduct physical inventory of PPE in accordance 
with Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I and prepare the IIRUP 

for the unserviceable property found; and  

 

b. The Accountant and the Supply Officer to, thereafter, conduct regular 
reconciliation of the PPEs account reported in the RPCPPE with the GL 

balances, investigate any discrepancies noted and make the corresponding 

adjustments.   

 

b. Non-disposal of unserviceable PPEs - ₱5,906,806.86 
 

79. Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 provides that, “When the 
government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it 
shall, upon, application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of 
the agency or his duly representative xxx and if found to be valueless or unsaleable, it may 
be destroyed. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder 
under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body xxx. In the event 
that public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such prices as may be 
fixed by the same committee or body concerned xxx.”  

 
80. Moreover, IPSAS 17 states that, “The carrying amount of an item of property, plant, 
and equipment shall be derecognized: (a) on disposal; or (b) when no future economic 
benefits or service potential is expected from its use or disposal.”  
  
81. As at December 31, 2020, the unserviceable properties which remained in the 
NRCP’s books of accounts amounted to ₱5,906,806.86 consisting of various defective and 
obsolete Office Equipment, Information and Technology Equipment, Communication 
Equipment, Other Property Plant and Equipment and Other Assets.  It was observed that 
these unserviceable properties continue to gather dust and occupy spaces in the NRCP’s 
storage room.  A summary thereof is shown in Table 9.

Total ₱2,550,896.38 ₱3,355,910.48 ₱5,906,806.86 
 

82. Due to non-disposal, the carrying amounts of these assets are continuously carried 
in the books of accounts and reported in the Financial Statements (FS) as assets, although 
these are already without use or service potential, which could possibly mislead the 
users/readers of the FS.  Moreover, the deferment of the disposal of unserviceable 
properties resulted in their further deterioration and reduction of saleable value. 

 

83. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Disposal Committee to appraise and dispose the unserviceable 
properties to avoid deterioration and accordingly, maximize the potential 

income that could be derived from their sale; and  

 

b. The Accountant to prepare, after the disposal, the necessary accounting 
entries to derecognize the said PPEs from the book of accounts. 

 

Non-compliance with RA 9184 

84. The procurement of supply of labor and materials for the roofing extension of 
NRCP Atrium building, amounting to ₱391,410.84 is not advantageous to the 

government due to: (a) absence of competitive bidding; (b) lack of detailed 

information in the agency’s Annual Procurement Plan (APP); (c) lack of 

documentary requirements; and (d) advance payment of 50% of the contract cost 

which is in violation of the revised IRR of RA 9184 and PD 1445.   

 

85. Item I of Annex H of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) 
of Republic Act (RA) 9184 provides the policy statement that as a general rule, all 
procurement shall be through Competitive Bidding. However, whenever justified by the 
conditions provided in RA 9184 and its revised IRR, the Procuring Entity may, in order to 
promote economy and efficiency, resort to any of the alternative methods of procurement 
provided in Rule XVI of the revised IRR of RA 9184.  

 
 



59 
 

 
86. The Alternative Methods of Procurement shall be resorted to only in the highly 
exceptional cases provided for in this Guidelines and subject to the prior approval of the 
Head of the Procuring Entity (HoPE) upon recommendation of the Bids and Awards 
Committee (BAC). In all instances, the Procuring Entity shall ensure that the most 
advantageous price for the Government is obtained. 
 
87. Section V.C.1 Annex H of the 2016 IRR of RA 9184 defines “Shopping” as a 
method of procurement of goods whereby the Procuring Entity simply requests for the 
submission of price quotations for readily available off-the-shelf goods or ordinary/regular 
equipment to be procured directly from suppliers of known qualifications. This method of 
procurement shall be employed in any of the following cases:  
 

a. When there is an unforeseen contingency requiring immediate purchase, the 
amount shall not exceed, for NGAs, GOCCs, GFIs, SUCs, and Autonomous 
Regional Government, Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (₱200,000.00) 

 
b. Procurement of ordinary or regular office supplies and equipment not available 

in the DBM-PS, in the amount not to exceed, for NGAs, GOCCs, GFIs, SUCs, 
and Autonomous Regional Government, One Million Pesos (₱1,000,000.00) 

 
88. The phrase “ordinary or regular office supplies” shall be understood to include 
those supplies, commodities, or materials which are necessary in the transaction of its 
official businesses, and consumed in the day-to-day office operations. 
 
89. The NRCP entered into job order agreement with a single proprietorship company, 
through Job Order No. 19-12-091 dated December 23, 2019, with a contract cost of 
₱391,410.84 for the supply of labor and materials for the roofing extension of NRCP’s 
Atrium. In the verification of the Repairs and Maintenance expense account and the DVs, 
we observed the following: 
 

a) Absence of competitive bidding - ₱391,410.84 
 
90. Verification of the documents attached in the DV revealed that a Purchase Request 
(PR) was prepared dated December 12, 2019, with an item description of one lot for supply 
of labor and materials for the roofing extension of NRCP Atrium. On December 19, 2019, 
the Request for Quotation (RFQ) was posted in the PhilGEPS website with a closing date 
on December 23, 2019, in compliance with the posting requirement of RA 1984.  Further, 
audit revealed that the RFQ has an Approved Budget of the Contract (ABC) of ₱400,000.00 
and the mode of procurement was shopping.   
 
91. The NRCP’s procurement with an ABC amounting to ₱400,000.00 for the 
construction of roofing extension of the Atrium, is not qualified for shopping, rather it 
requires competitive bidding.  Further, alternative modes of procurement like Shopping, 



60 
 

Small Value Procurement and other modes of procurement can be availed only if the 
conditions for such are met.  Likewise, NRCP’s BAC did not issue any resolution or 
minutes of meetings for the said undertaking. 

 
92. The above-stated regulations provide, as a general rule, all procurement shall be 
through Competitive Bidding. The Alternative Methods of Procurement shall be resorted 
to only for highly exceptional cases provided for in the revised IRR of RA 9184 and subject 
to the prior approval of the HoPE upon recommendation of the BAC.  It further states that 
the alternative mode of procurement like Shopping is only applicable to procurement of 
ordinary or regular office supplies and equipment not available in the PS-DBM. 

 
93. The non-conduct of competitive bidding is a clear violation of the revised IRR of 
RA 9184, thus, indicative of poor planning of the agency’s procurement process and the 
government is not afforded with the most advantageous and reasonable price. 

 
b) Lack of detailed information of the project in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP) 

 
94. Section 7.2 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184 provides that no procurement 
shall be undertaken unless it is in accordance with the approved APP, including approved 
changes thereto. The APP must be consistent with the duly approved yearly budget of the 
Procuring Entity and shall bear the approval of the HoPE. 

 
95. The construction of the roofing extension of the NRCP Atrium was not clearly 
indicated in the Agency’s APP nor was a Project Procurement Management Plan (PPMP) 
prepared by the Property Office which is the concerned end-user unit.  The project on the 
construction of roof extension with an ABC of ₱400,000.00 should be clearly indicated in 
the APP which also suggests the mode of procurement. The implementation of a project 
that is not clearly indicated in the APP not only indicates the agency’s non-compliance 
with pertinent provisions of RA 9184 but also shows the laxity of the concerned officials 
to meticulously and prudently plan the procurement of this specific project. 

 
c) Lack of documentary requirements 

 
c.1. No contract of agreement, inspection report and certificate of acceptance 
 

96. Item V.D.8 of Annex H of the IRR of RA 9184 which provides the specific 
guidelines/procedures for Shopping or Small Value Procurement states that BAC shall 
prepare and send the Request for Quotations or Request for Proposals (RFQs/RFPs) to at 
least three (3) suppliers, contractors or consultants of known qualifications.  This, 
notwithstanding, those who responded through any of the required postings shall be 
allowed to participate. Receipt of at least one (1) quotation is sufficient to proceed with the 
evaluation thereof.  It further provides that except for those with ABCs equal to Fifty 
Thousand Pesos (₱50,000.00) and below, RFQs shall be posted for a period of three (3) 
calendar days in the PhilGEPS website, website of the Procuring Entity, if available, and 
at any conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the premises of the Procuring Entity. 

 



61 
 

97. The agency posted the RFQ in the PhilGEPS website on December 19, 2019 up to 
December 23, 2019, but it was not posted in the NRCP’s website.  Likewise, there was no 
proof that the RFQ was posted in conspicuous places within the agency premises nor did 
the NRCP send the RFQ to at least three contractors to have a comparison of a reasonable 
cost, since no abstract of quotation was attached to the DV of the advance payment.  

 
98. Relatively, the proponent submitted the quotation on December 17, 2019 with the 
project cost of ₱391,410.84, but the NRCP did not prepare a contract of agreement for the 
project, instead it issued to the contractor Job Order No. 19-12-091 dated December 23, 
2019 with the project cost of the same amount. 

 
99. Further, the DV for the final payment is not supported with the Inspection Report 
and the Certificate of Acceptance, as proof on the completion of the project.  On the 
contrary, the Abstract of Quotation was attached to the final payment which should be a 
supporting document of the advance payment. 

 
100. The condition cited above is not indicative of the widest possible dissemination of 
the RFQ; thus, it could not be said that equal opportunity was given to private contracting 
parties who are eligible and qualified to participate in the proposals and the government 
was not afforded with the most advantageous and reasonable price. 

 
c.2. No official receipts - ₱391,410.84 
 

101. Item 6, Section 4 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 (PD 1445) states that “Claims 
against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.” 

 
102. Verification of the DVs showed that payment was not supported with the Official 
Receipts (OR) as a proof of the payment, thus, in violation of the provision in PD 1445, as 
detailed in Table 10 below.

d) Advance payment of 50% of the contract price - ₱195,705.42 
 

104. Section 4.1. Annex E of the IRR of RA 9184 provides that the procuring entity 
shall, upon a written request of the contractor which shall be submitted as a contract 
document, make an advance payment to the contractor in an amount not exceeding fifteen 
percent (15%) of the total contract price, to be made in lump sum or, at the most, two 
installments according to a schedule specified in the Instructions to Bidders and other 
relevant tender documents. 

 
105. Verification of the documents attached in the DV revealed that the contractor 
submitted its work plan showing the work weeks and the date when to start the project.  It 
was indicated in the work plan that the project started January 27, 2020 and will be 
completed February 23, 2020. 

 
106. It can be gleaned from Table 10 that the NRCP made an advance payment to the 
contractor on February 5, 2020, equivalent to 50% of the contract price which amounted 
to ₱195,705.42.  Hence, a clear violation of the above provision, to make an advance 
payment to the contractor in an amount not exceeding fifteen percent (15%) of the total 
contract price. Management commented that they failed to consider the applicability of the 
15% provision as the project will be completed in a month’s time. 

 
107. The conditions and deficiencies noted clearly denote that the NRCP Management 
did not fully comprehend several provisions in the 2016 revised IRR of RA 9184, otherwise 
known as the Government Procurement Reform Act, thus, NRCP demonstrated poor 
planning in their procurement process and the government is not afforded with the most 
advantageous and reasonable price. 

 
108. We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. submit a written explanation for the: (i) non-conduct of the competitive 
bidding; (ii) no detailed information of the undertaking in the APP; (iii) no 

contract of agreement; and (iv) 50% advance payment;  
 

b. require the contractor to submit the OR of the two payments, to avoid 
audit disallowance;  

 
c. henceforth, comply with the requirements of the provisions in the 2016 

revised IRR of RA 9184 to have transparency in the procurement process 

and the full dissemination of bid opportunities to suppliers and contractors 

of known qualifications; and 
 

d. require the BAC and/or the Property Officer to review and comply with 
the provisions under the 2016 revised IRR of RA 9184 as a guide in all the 

procurement activities of the NRCP.

Procurement of airline tickets from travel agencies - ₱235,150.00 
 
109. Airline tickets for official travels with the total cost of ₱235,150.00 were 
procured from various travel agencies, contrary to Section 20 of the FY 2020 General 

Appropriations Act; thus, it could not be determined if the government was afforded 

with the most advantageous price of transportation. 
 
110. Section 20 of RA 11465 or the FY 2020 General Appropriations Act (GAA), 
provides that all agencies of the government shall purchase its common-use supplies 
requirement from the Procurement Service (PS) as mandated under LOI No. 755 dated 
October 18, 1978, EO No. 359, AO No. 17, s. 2011 and such other guidelines issued 
thereon. 
 
111. Since airline tickets were already considered as common-use supplies, based on the 
guidelines set by the DBM, all common-use supplies should be purchased from the PS-
DBM.  The procurement by the NRCP of the plane tickets from various travel agencies 
which amounted to ₱235,150.00 is a clear violation of Section 20 of the FY 2020 GAA 
aside from the fact that the NRCP has already have a GFA with the PS-DBM and advance 
payment was already made.  

 
112. Management reasoned that these procurements are for the travel requirements of 
the DOST-GIA projects, charged to trust fund. Due to convenience, considering these are 
small projects, they resorted to procure airline tickets from various travel agencies instead 
of making an advance payment to the PS-DBM for trust fund. 

 
113. Due to this practice, there is no proof that the most advantageous price and terms 
were obtained for the government considering that the cost of airfare as well as the terms 
vary from one travel agency to another. 

 
114. We recommended and Management agreed to stop the practice of procuring 
airline tickets from private travel agencies. 

 

Advance payment of 50 percent of the contract cost 
 

115. The advance payment of 50 percent of the contract cost to consultants and 
project leaders is in violation of the 2016 revised IRR of RA 9184.  

 

116. The NRCP engaged the professional services of private consultants or project 
leaders, for their individual expertise to implement the various basic research projects of 
the former.  The said undertakings are covered with Contract of Service or Memorandum 
of Agreement (MOA) which identifies the NRCP as the Implementing Agency. 
 

117. Section 1, Annex F of the 2016 revised IRR of RA 9184 provides the contract 
implementation guidelines for the procurement of consulting services.  The government, 
as it considers fair and reasonable, may allow advance payment to the Consultant in the 
amount which shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the contract amount to cover the 



64 
 

cost of mobilization, subject to the posting of an irrevocable standby letter of credit issued 
by an entity acceptable to the agency and of an amount equal to the advance payment. The 
advance payment shall be repaid by the Consultant by deducting from his progress 
payments such sum as agreed upon during the contract negotiations until fully liquidated 
within the duration of the contract. 
 
118. Advance payments were made to consultants and RDLs by the NRCP more than 
the threshold of 15 percent of the contract cost, which is a clear violation of the above 
provision in the 2016 revised IRR of RA 1984. Percentage of advance payment ranges 
from 20% to 50% of the contract cost, resulting in the government funds being tied up in 
the hands of these private individuals which could have been used for other government 
priority projects. 

 
119. According to Management, payments for consultants and RDLs are output-based 
as stipulated in the MOA; therefore, initial payments are based on the percentage of output. 
     
120. We recommended and Management agreed to comply with the requirements 
of the provisions in the IRR of RA 9184 with regard to the advance payment and all 

procurement activities of the NRCP.

Gender and Development  
 
122. The NRCP allocated P4,820,059.00 or 5.25 percent of its total appropriations 
for GAD activities pursuant to GAA FY 2020 provisions and Joint Circular No. 2012-

01 of the Philippine Commission on Women, National Economic and Development 

Authority, and Department of Budget and Management (PCW-NEDA-DBM). 

However, only P1,179,445.32 or 24.47 percent of the GAD budget was expended.  

 
123. Section 31 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act for FY 
2020 states that all agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to 
address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the 
applicable provisions under RA 9710 or Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the 
Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for 
Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the 
Philippines Development Plan (2017-2022). 
 
124. Further, it provides that the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities 
of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets for activities 
which relate to GAD. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies 
which shall relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic 
empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion and fulfillment of 
women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered 
sufficient compliance with said requirement.  The preparation and submission of the annual 
GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and annual GAD Accomplishment Report shall be subject 
to the guidelines issued by the agencies concerned. 
  
125. Item 3.4 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 provides that 
mainstreaming gender perspectives in agency PAPs to attain the desired outcomes for GAD 
shall be a priority in GAD planning and budgeting. Using the 5% GAD budget for gender 
mainstreaming is a way for agencies to influence the entire agency program, plan and 
budget. To aid gender mainstreaming, agencies shall perform gender analysis using 
existing tools, such as the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG), to 
ensure that the different concerns of women and men are addressed equally and equitably 
in their PAPs. Activities to address these differential concerns through capacity 
development on GAD or GAD-focused activities shall be included in agency GAD Plan 
and Budgets (GPBs). 
 
 
 



66 
 

126. Audit of the NRCP GAD activities showed that the agency was able to allocate 
P4,820,059.00 or 5.25 percent of its total appropriations. However, it failed to maximize 
the allocated budget because two of the attributed programs/projects funded in 2020 were 
scheduled to be implemented in 2021, thus, there is no accomplishment yet to be included 
in the GAD AR for 2020. The said programs/projects make the 74.16 percent of the GAD 
budget, adversely affecting its accomplishment and utilization. 

 
127. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Focal Person for 
GAD to diligently prepare the GAD plan for every year taking into consideration the 

timeline of attributed programs, and maximize its allocated budget by implementing 

activities as planned.  

 

Hiring and payment of Contractual and Job Order Personnel 
 
128. A total of 37 Contractual Personnel were hired by the NRCP as at December 31, 
2020. These employees performed administrative works and other functions needed by 
Management. Their wages were recorded under the Other Professional Services account 
totaling ₱9,677,328.30. 
 

Implementation of Senior Citizens and Differently-abled Persons Program 
 

129. Management failed to submit plans, projects and activities for CY 2020, 
together with the accomplishments to address the concerns of senior citizens and 

differently-abled persons, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, pursuant 

to Section 32 of the General Provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 11465, otherwise 

known as the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020. 

 

130. Section 32 of RA 11465 provides that: 
 

 “All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects 
intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and person with disability, 
in so far as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in 
their regular activities.  Moreover, all government infrastructure and facilities 
shall provide architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will 
reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with disability 
pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and R.A. No. 7277, as amended.” 

 
131. Despite follow-ups with Management, the NRCP failed to submit plans, projects 
and activities, together with their accomplishments to address the concerns of Senior 
Citizens and Differently-Abled Persons for CY 2020.   
 
132. We recommended and Management agreed to, henceforth, formulate and 
implement plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior 

citizens and differently-abled persons, and submit the accomplishment reports to 

COA for validation and reporting purposes, in compliance with existing laws, rules 

and regulations.

Youth Development 
 
133. The Council failed to conduct programs/activities related to youth development as 
required under Section 33 of the General Provisions of RA 11465 due to pandemic 
restrictions. However, the NRCP conducted a series of webinars called “Kapakanan ng Tao 
sa Oras ng Pandemya” (KTOP) and included a topic regarding teenage pregnancy during 
COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
134. We recommended and Management agreed to conduct programs/activities 
related to youth development, and thereafter, submit its accomplishment report to 

the Audit Team for validation and reporting purposes. 
 
Compliance with Property Insurance Law   
 
135. The Council insured all their insurable property, assets and interest with the General 
Insurance Fund (GIF) administered by the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS).  
The total insurance expense for CY 2020 amounted to ₱65,576.85.  
 
Enforcement of Settlement of Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges (SASDC) 
 
136. The total suspensions, disallowances and charges found in the audit of various
