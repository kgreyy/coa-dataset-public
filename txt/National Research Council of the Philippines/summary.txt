EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
         

A. Introduction 
 

          The National Research Council of the Philippines (NRCP) was created 

by Act No. 4120 of the Ninth Philippine Legislature dated December 8, 1933 for 

the promotion of science advancement through research. In the reorganization of 

then National Science and Technology Authority (NSTA) under Executive Order 

(EO) No. 784 on March 17, 1982, NRCP was retained as a collegial body and 

named as Sectoral Council to engage primarily in supporting research of a more 

basic and fundamental nature, in contrast to the applied research orientation of the 

other Council under the NSTA System. Such functions were, however, phased out 

in 1987 under EO No. 128 and the Council was renamed as the Philippine National 

Science Society. On December 8, 1990 by virtue of Republic Act (RA) No. 6974, 

NRCP was restored to the original name and status as specified under Act No. 4120. 

  

 The NRCP is mandated to: promote and support the fundamental or basic 

research for the continuing improvement of the research capability of individual or 

group of scientists; foster linkages with local and international scientific 

organizations for enhanced cooperation in the development and sharing of scientific 

information; provide advice on problems and issues of national interest; and 

promote scientific and technological culture to all sectors of society. 

 

 The affairs of NRCP are administered by a Governing Board composed of: 

two (2) Members-at-Large, the Chairmen of Scientific Divisions, the DOST 

representative, and the Chairmen/Presidents Emeriti of the Council. The Secretariat 

has a total workforce of 53 headed by Dr. Marieta Bañez Sumagaysay, Executive 

Director, who oversees the overall management of the Council’s activities. She is 

assisted by the Division Chiefs of Research Development and Management 

Division (RDMD), Research Information and Dissemination Division (RIDD), and 

Finance and Administrative Division (FAD). As of December 31, 2020, the NRCP 

has a total manpower complement of 79 personnel consisting of 42 regular and 37 

contractual.

C. Scope of Audit 
 

 The audit covered the accounts and operations of NRCP for the year ended 

December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to (a) verify the level of assurance 

that may be placed in management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) 

recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; (c) determine the propriety of 

transactions as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and 

regulations; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit 

recommendations. 

 

D. Independent Auditor’s Report 
 

 A qualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements as at 

December 31, 2020. 

  

E.  Summary of Other Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following were other significant audit observations to be addressed, 

details of which are further discussed in the Part II of the report. Audit Observation 



 

iii 

 

Memoranda were issued and required them for their views and comments which 

were incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

  

1. The Cash in Bank - Local Currency Current Account (LCCA) account with 
GL balance of ₱436,035.45 cannot be ascertained due to: (a) non-preparation of 

Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS), resulting in a variance of ₱512,560.71 

between the book and bank balances, which is not in accordance with Section 3, 

Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I; and (b) collections from different sources 

maintained in the bank by the NRCP were not remitted to the Bureau of the 

Treasury (BTr), contrary to Section 2 of Executive Order No. 338, thus, affecting 

the fair presentation of the Cash in Bank balance in the FS and impeding the use of 

funds for other government projects. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

 

a. prepare the BRS and determine the reconciling items and record the 
same in the books to reflect the correct balance of the account in the FS;  

 

b. effect the immediate transfer of the bank balance of the account to the 
BTr pursuant to the afore-cited provisions of laws, rules and regulations and 

the compliance thereafter; and 
 

c. make the necessary coordination with the LBP for the closing of the 
account. 

 

2. Fund transfers totaling ₱46,791,795.50 recorded under the accounts Due 
from NGAs, and Other Receivables remained unliquidated due to inadequate 

project monitoring, particularly on the submission of Financial Reports (FRs) and 

refund of unexpended balances, contrary to COA Circular No. 94-013 dated 

December 13, 1994, and DOST Administrative Order No. 009 series of 2017. 

Further, Other Receivables account includes fund transfer to undocumented 

research grants amounting to ₱1,806,579.50 to 18 private individuals. 

 

We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations and Management agreed to 

require: 

 

a. Project Officers/Division Chiefs to regularly and closely monitor the 

research grants which were subject of FTs and strictly enforce the provisions 

of DOST AO No. 005 on the reporting requirements for the grants, not only 

on the submission of technical reports but also of the financial reports; 

 

b. Project Division personnel to send demand letters to IAs/project 

leaders, stating definite deadlines and the possible blacklisting/legal actions 

that may be instigated against them in case of non-compliance to exhaust all 

possible remedies to compel the IAs/private individuals to liquidate their long-

outstanding balances; and 



 

iv 

 

 

c. Project Officers/Division Chiefs to exert effort in locating those 

supporting documents that were not on file to establish the liability of the 

recipients and its whereabouts. 

 

3. Fund Transfers to NGAs amounting to ₱26,128,515.00 with prepared DVs 
were not properly documented, which is not in accordance with Sec. 4 of P.D. No. 

1445, thus, transactions are doubtful. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to enjoin the Accountant/ Project 

Leaders/Division Heads to require the recipients of grants to submit the 

needed ORs for proper documentation of the transactions to avoid future 

disallowance in audit. 

 

4. The accuracy and reliability of the PPE accounts balance of ₱67,440,842.42   
could not be ascertained due to: (a) discrepancies of ₱36,124,827.24 between the 

GL balances and the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) attributable 

to: (i) dropped balances of the unserviceable PPE in the property records; and (ii) 

lack of regular reconciliation between accounting and property records; and (b) 

non-disposal of unserviceable PPEs amounting to ₱5,906,806.86. 

 

a. Discrepancy between accounting and property records – ₱36,124,827.24 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the:  

 

a. The Supply Officer to conduct physical inventory of PPE in accordance 
with Section 38, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I and prepare the IIRUP for 

the unserviceable property found; and  

 

b. The Accountant and the Supply Officer to, thereafter, conduct regular 
reconciliation of the PPEs account reported in the RPCPPE with the GL 

balances, investigate any discrepancies noted and make the corresponding 

adjustments.   

 

b.  Non-disposal of unserviceable PPEs - ₱5,906,806.86 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. The Disposal Committee to appraise and dispose the unserviceable 
properties to avoid deterioration and accordingly, maximize the potential 

income that could be derived from their sale; and  

 

b. The Accountant to prepare, after the disposal, the necessary accounting 
entries to derecognize the said PPEs from the book of accounts. 

 



 

v 

 

5. The procurement of supply of labor and materials for the roofing extension 
of NRCP Atrium building, amounting to ₱391,410.84 is not advantageous to the 

government due to: (a) absence of competitive bidding; (b) lack of detailed 

information in the agency’s Annual Procurement Plan (APP); (c) lack of 

documentary requirements; and (d) advance payment of 50% of the contract cost 

which is in violation of the revised IRR of RA 9184 and PD 1445.   

 

 We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. submit a written explanation for the: (i) non-conduct of the competitive 
bidding; (ii) no detailed information of the undertaking in the APP; (iii) no 

contract of agreement; and (iv) 50% advance payment;  
 

b. require the contractor to submit the OR of the two payments, to avoid 
audit disallowance;  

 

c. henceforth, comply with the requirements of the provisions in the 2016 
revised IRR of RA 9184 to have transparency in the procurement process 

and the full dissemination of bid opportunities to suppliers and contractors 

of known qualifications; and 
 

d. require the BAC and/or the Property Officer to review and comply with 
the provisions under the 2016 revised IRR of RA 9184 as a guide in all the 

procurement activities of the NRCP.  
 

6. Airline tickets for official travels with the total cost of ₱235,150.00 were 
procured from various travel agencies, contrary to Section 20 of the FY 2020 

General Appropriations Act; thus, it could not be determined if the government was 

afforded with the most advantageous price of transportation. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to stop the practice of procuring 

airline tickets from private travel agencies. 

 

7. The advance payment of 50 percent of the contract cost to consultants and 
project leaders is in violation of the 2016 revised IRR of RA 9184. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to comply with the requirements 

of the provisions in the IRR of RA 9184 with regard to the advance payment 

and all procurement activities of the NRCP.
