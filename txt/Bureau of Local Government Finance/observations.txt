OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

Financial Audit 

 

Accounting errors and omissions 

 

1. Various accounting errors and omissions in the keeping of accounts resulted in 
the misstatements of some assets, liabilities, equity and expense accounts in the 

FSs. 

 

Section 15, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of the Government Accounting Manual 

(GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) requires that the financial 

statements (FSs) present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash 

flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects 

of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 

recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in the  

International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs).  

 

Review and verification of the accounts and transactions of the Bureau of Local 

Government Finance (BLGF) disclosed errors and omissions that resulted in the 

misstatement of the balances of affected accounts in the FSs, as summarized in Table 

1.

Accountants of the Regional Offices (ROs) to: (a) prepare the necessary adjusting 

journal entries to correct the aforementioned errors and omissions; and, (b) 

observe the proper/correct recognition of accounts and transactions in 

accordance with the GAM for NGAs and other applicable rules and regulations. 

        

 

Accounting Deficiencies 

 

2. A number of accounts were either with unreconciled balances, discrepancies 
between and/or non-maintenance of accounting and property records, or not 

properly documented, thus, accuracy and reliability of the same cannot be fully 

ascertained.  

 

Section 6 (e), Chapter 19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs on Qualitative 

Characteristics of Financial Reporting requires that an entity shall present information 

including accounting policies in a manner that meets the following qualitative 

characteristics enumerated in IPSAS 1: (e) Reliability - reliable information is free 

from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully 

that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. 

 

Analysis of the accounts and transactions of the BLGF-CO and 15 ROs 

revealed various deficiencies that have an impact on the reliability of information 

presented in the FSs, as summarized in Table 2.

In view of cross-cutting issues, the accounting deficiencies also include 
compliance issues, with the corresponding recommendations discussed as follows:  

 

a. Unreliable balance of the Receivables-Disallowance/Charges - RO XIII  
 

Section 7.2.1d, Chapter II of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on Settlement 

of Accounts (RRSA) prescribed in COA Circular No. 2009-006, requires that the 

Chief Accountant ensure that the disallowances and charges that have become final 

and executory as contained in the NFD, and their settlements under the NSSDC are 

recorded in the books of accounts.  

 

Moreover, Section 46, Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs provides 

that disallowances shall be taken up in the books of accounts only when they 

become final and executory.   

 

The RO XIII’s balance of Receivables-Disallowance/Charges of 

P216,498.65 as at December 31, 2020 was unreliable due to the erroneous recording 

of disallowances and settlements without the issuance of NFDs and NSSDCs, 

respectively, which consequently affected the accuracy of the account balance 

reported in the FSs. 

 



 
 

41 

Comparison of the balances per General Ledger (GL) maintained by the 

Bookkeeper and the Statement of Audit Suspension, Disallowances and Charges 

(SASDC) for the period ending December 31, 2020 issued by the Audit Team 

disclosed a difference of (P208,293.56), due to the following:  

 
Particulars Amount (in P) 

a) Disallowances taken up in the books in CYs 2011 to 

2015, 2018 and 2019 without ND or NFD issued 182,346.31 

b) Erroneous entries reflected in the GL in CYs 2011, 2014 

and 2016 6,327.00 

c) Settlements taken up in the books in CYs 2011 to 2014, 

2016 and 2018 pertaining to disallowances without ND 

or NFD (138,980.31) 

d) Settlements recorded in the books still for issuance of 

NSSDC pending submission of the official receipts, 

deposit slips and other supporting documents (257,986.56)  

Difference (208,293.56) 

 

It was further observed that the Bookkeeper did not prepare, as previously 

recommended by the Audit Team, a monitoring schedule per ND received that 

indicates the information of the disallowance, person/s liable, receipt of 

corresponding NFD and COA Order of Execution (COE), authority to settle in 

installment, and settlements made that were already covered and not yet covered by 

NSSDC. 

 

The recording in the Receivables-Disallowances/Charges of various 

disallowances and settlements without NFD and NSSDC as basis or source 

documents, as well as the erroneous entries noted in audit is not in accordance with 

the pertinent provisions of the 2009 RRSA and Section 46, Chapter 6, Volume I of 

the GAM for NGAs, thereby rendering the reported account balance as at December 

31, 2020 doubtful.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Bookkeeper 

to: (a) establish the correct balance of the Receivables-Disallowances/Charges 

by validating all the entries affecting the account against the available 

documents and ensure that transactions recorded therein were based on NFD 

and NSSDC received, and  prepare adjusting journal entries for any errors or 

discrepancies that may be noted; and (b) update the subsidiary ledger per 

person liable to support the GL balance of the Receivables-

Disallowances/Charges based on the result of the reconciliation undertaken 

and prepare a monitoring schedule indicating all the necessary information on 

the status of settlement for each ND. 

 

b. Unreconciled balances per books and RPCPPE  
 

The total PPE of RO V amounting to P30.452 million as at December 31, 

2020 was unreliable due to the discrepancy of P2.399 million between the books 



 
 

42 

and the RPCPPE for Office Equipment, ICT Equipment and Furniture and Fixtures 

amounting to P0.683 million, P212,609.47 and P1.503 million, respectively. 

 

We recommended that Management require the Accountant and 

Property/Supply Officer of RO V to reconcile their records and to adjust noted 

discrepancies accordingly. 

 

c. Unreconciled discrepancy between CO books and PS and NPO records -P1.744 

million 

Audit of Due from NGAs disclosed a total variance of P1.657 million 

between the BLGF-CO books and NPO records as at December 31, 2020. The 

BLGF-CO reported a balance of P1.657 million under Due from NGAs-NPO while 

the NPO reported zero balance under the BLGF-CO account in its records per 

confirmation reply received since no Statement of Account (SOA) was provided by 

the NPO to the Audit Team.  The Due from NGAs-NPO is used by CO to recognize 

the publication of the Philippine Valuation Standards (PVS) in the Official Gazette 

as well as the printing of some PVS and the purchase of imported security paper.  

 

The discrepancies in the recording of transactions involving the account Due 

from NGAs-NPO, were due to: (a) delivery by NPO to the BLGF-CO in CY 2019 

of 100 pieces of PVS 2nd edition, and publication in the Official Gazette in CY 

2019 amounting to P265,074.00 remained unrecorded in the books; and (b) 

undelivered items as at December 31, 2020 of P1.392 million were not included in 

the BLGF-CO account balance with the NPO per confirmation reply. 

 

The difference of P86,344.42 between the BLGF-CO books and the PS SOA 

was due to the unutilized balances covering CY 2012 and prior years (PYs) 
deducted by PS from the account Due to NGAs-BLGF Main. The PS SOA for CY 

2019 amounting to P154,341.56 and the unaccounted discrepancies for 

reconciliation with PS of P67,997.14, resulted in a variance of P86,344.42. The said 

variance between the balance per BLGF-CO books and the balance per 

confirmation with the PS and its SOA resulted from non-reconciliation of PS PYs’ 

records, thus affecting the correctness of the reported balance of the Due from NGAs 

in the Statement of Financial Position. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the OIC Chief, 

FMD to: (a) deduct  P265,074.00 from the reported balance of Due from NGAs-

NPO as at December 31, 2020, and effect the necessary adjustment in 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit);  (b) reconcile with the NPO the discrepancy of 

P1.392 million between BLGF-CO books and NPO records representing 

undelivered items; (c) henceforth, reconcile regularly with the NPO to avoid 

misstatements in the recorded balance, and monitor the payments to and 

deliveries from the NPO; (d) reconcile with the PS the difference of P86,344.42 

between BLGF-CO books and PS SOA; and (e) verify and reconcile with the 

PS the composition of the amount it deducted from the account Due to NGAs-



 
 

43 

BLGF-CO aggregating P154,341.56, and make the necessary adjustment/s in 

the books. 

 

d.  Non-recognition of issuances of inventory/semi-expendable items to end-users 

due to lack of RSMI  

 

Analysis of transactions and relevant documents and records pertaining to 

semi-expendable accounts of the BLGF-CO disclosed non-recognition of issuances 

in PYs’ of semi-expendable items to end-users due to lack of RSMI amounting to 

P4.774 million, as follows:  

 

i. Semi-expendable-Furniture and Fixtures issued in CY 2018 totalling 
P3.571 million; 

ii. Property Valuation Books issued in CY 2019 amounting to P5,220.00; 
iii. Semi-expendable Office Equipment issued in CYs 2017 and 2018 totalling 

P260,897.25; and 

iv. Semi-expendable ICT equipment issued in CY 2018 totalling P0.937 
million. 

 

The two cellular phones amounting to P14,060.00 recognized as Semi-

Expendable-ICT Equipment and issued to end-users in CY 2020 was an emergency 

purchase; the required justification as to its necessity was not submitted, as required 

under  Item 9.2.5 of COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. The issuance of 

these cellular phones, however, was not recognized in the books as at December 

31, 2020. 

 

 The Property Officer disclosed that the Property Unit had not prepared the 

RSMI and the Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) required to be submitted to the 

Accounting Unit to support the recognition of expense and derecognition of the 

semi-expendable inventory accounts upon issue of the items to end-users since the 

Property Unit presumed that said reports are for office supplies inventories only, 

while the Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) supports the issuance of semi-expendable 

items. 

 

We recommended that Management require the:  

 

a) Acting Accountant to: (i) require the end-user to submit justification 
for the emergency purchase of two cellular phones amounting to  

P14,060.00; and (ii) correct the accounting deficiencies noted, in 

accordance with relevant provisions of the GAM for NGAS; and  

 

b) Property Officer to submit to the Accounting Unit the RIS and RSMI, 
reflecting therein the actual dates of issuances for the various semi-

expendable items already issued to end-users in order to determine the 

proper period and support the recognition of expenses. 

 



 
 

44 

 

e. PPEs transferred to the RO-IV B not provided with proper valuation 

 

Review of the balances of the PPE accounts of RO IV-B as at December 

31, 2020 amounting to P2.645 million disclosed that: (1) PPEs transferred to the 

RO were not provided with proper valuation as required in COA Circular No. 2020-

006 dated January 31, 2020; and (2) ICT equipment totalling P229,380.00 were 

recognized in the books not using their costs in the RPCPPE, thus, rendered the 

reported balances of PPE inaccurate and unreliable. 

 

Moreover, examination of the RPCPPE revealed that other PPE items such 

as desktop computer and notebook computer from BLGF-CO and the Acer 

projector with tripod screen from DBM Regional Inter-Agency Team (RIAT) have 

no cost/values.  Inquiry and confirmation with the Accountant revealed that these 

PPEs were transferred to the agency without costs, thus, not recorded in its books.  

 

The agency should have exerted efforts to locate the documents and seek 

the help of donors of the properties for the proper valuation thereof.  In the event 

that documents could no longer be sought, the agency could adopt Section 6.2.12. 

of COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 that in case no such 

information could be found in both accounting and property records such as for 

PPE items found at station, the unit cost/value shall be established, as follows: (a) 

cost/value may be assigned by the Inventory Committee based on the market/fair 

value of the item.  The cost/value of a similar item in the RPCPPE may also be used 

by the Inventory Committee and (b) if there are items for which market/fair value 

could not be easily determined by the Inventory Committee, their fair value shall 

be determined by appraisal. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) require the 

Procurement Officer to coordinate with BLGF-CO and RIAT from DBM to 

provide the documents on the transfer of the PPEs without costs, and if not 

provided, refer to Section 6.2.12 of COA Circular No. 2020-006 for the proper 

valuation thereof; and (b) instruct the Acting Accountant and Procurement 

Officer to immediately reconcile the RPCPPE and the PPE GL to arrive at 

reliable account balances.   

 

f.  Non-maintenance of accounting and property records, and non-preparation of   

reports and forms for PPE and inventory 

 

Verification of accounting and property records disclosed that the 

Bookkeeper and Supply Officer/Property Officer did not prepare and/or maintain 

the accounting and property records/reports/forms, respectively, as required under 

existing regulations as shown in Table 3.

The non-maintenance of accounting and property records, and non-preparation 

of reports and forms for PPE and inventory, among others, by the CO and ROs were 

due to the unexpected conditions brought about by Coronavirus Disease 2019 

(COVID-19) pandemic together with the adoption of the combination of Work from 

Home and Skeletal Work Force. This situation restricts the conduct of physical count 

of PPE resulting in the non-preparation of the RPCPPE, and also kept them from 

preparing and maintaining both accounting and property records/reports/forms.  

 

The non-maintenance of accounting and property records, and non-preparation 

of the required reports and forms for PPE and inventory had not provided the 

supporting details to the book balances of the affected accounts and the bases for 

reconciliation between the accounting and property records to ensure the 

completeness, existence and accuracy of related account balances at year-end. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the OIC Chief, 

FMD, RO XII Accountant, and Supply Officer/Property Custodian of the CO 

and concerned ROs to prepare and maintain the required accounting and 

property records, forms, and reports to facilitate the reconciliation process.

Compliance Issues 

 

Improper recognition of remittances of collections from settlements of disallowances 

 

3. In RO VII, the deposit of collections from settlements of receivables from 
disallowances was recorded outright to Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit), which is 

not in accordance with COA Circular No. 2020-001 and Section 47, Chapter 6, 

Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, thus remittances to the National Treasury under 

the account Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular were not properly recognized 

in the books of accounts of the RO. 
 

COA Circular No. 2020-001 prescribes the adoption of Volume III, the 

Revised Chart of Accounts (updated 2019), of the GAM for NGAs.  It provides that 

the Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular, is debited to recognize the amount of 

collections remitted to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) under General Fund, either 

directly or thru the Authorized Agent Banks (AABs) and Authorized Government 

Depository Banks (AGDBs).  At year-end, this account is credited to close the 

Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit).   

 

Review of the Receivables-Disallowances/Charges of RO VII revealed that 

deposits to the BTr of the monthly settlements of disallowances were recorded by 

debiting the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) and crediting the Receivables-

Disallowances/Charges. 

. 

By directly debiting the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) instead of the Cash-

Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular, it is not certain that all collections recognized in 

the books of the agency were properly recognized as remittances to the BTr. 

 

We recommended and the Regional Director agreed to instruct the Senior 

Bookkeeper-Designate to use the proper account Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, 

Regular, in recognizing the deposit of collections from settlements of 

disallowances in order to properly recognize in the books the remittances made 

to the BTr.  

 

Late/non-submission of financial, budgetary and other reports 

 

4. Non-/late submission of financial, budgetary, and other reports/documents by the 
CO and ROs affected the timely conduct of audit of the agencies’ operations and 

transactions. 

 

Section 122 of PD No. 1445 provides that whenever deemed necessary in the 

exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it require 

the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing officers, 

administrative or personnel officers, and other responsible officials of the various 



 
 

47 

agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current plantilla of 

personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions. 

 

Monitoring of compliance with the submission to the Audit Teams of 

financial, budgetary and other reports/documents for CY 2020 required under 

existing regulations disclosed that some reports were unsubmitted or were submitted 

beyond the prescribed period, with delays from one to 366 days, thus, affecting the 

conduct of timely audit and review of the agencies’ financial, budgetary and other 

transactions. Details are shown in Table 4.

Management acknowledged its failure to submit on time the required 

reports/documents due to: (a) the present alternative work arrangement being adopted 

by their office during COVID-19 pandemic; (b) the signatures of the authorized 

personnel and/or the required supporting documents could not be easily obtained; (c) 

lack of personnel; and (d) other work load. 

 

The delay and non-submission of these reports hindered the Audit Teams to 

conduct timely review and evaluation of the agency’s financial and budgetary 

transactions. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require:  

  

a) The CO-OIC Chief of FMD, ROs III and IX Acting Accountants, RO XI 
Accountant and ROs VII and XIII Bookkeeper designate to submit to 

their respective audit team the financial reports with supporting 

documents, within the prescribed period under Section 60, Chapter 19, 

Volume I, GAM for NGAs; 

 



 
 

50 

b) The CO-OIC Chief of FMD and the Budget Officer to prepare and submit 
the consolidated and the CO Budget and Financial Accountability Reports 

(BFARs), and the Budget Officers of ROs III, IX, XI, and XIII to submit 

their individual BFARs, to the audit team within the period prescribed in 

Section 4.3 of COA-DBM JC No. 2019-1; 
 

c) The Supply Officers of ROs III and VI to furnish copies of POs and all 
supporting documents to the Auditor within five working days from 

issuance and fill-in properly the relevant information particularly the date 

the supplier conforms or affixes his signature on the PO; and  

 

d) The RO V driver to accomplish the Monthly Report of Official Travels 

supported by the Driver’s Trip Tickets and the Monthly Report of Fuel 

Consumption and submit to the Audit Team. 

 
Grant of Compensatory Time-off (CTO) 

 

5. Grant of Compensatory Time-Off (CTO) to various BLGF RO XI personnel who 
are on travel status resulted in unnecessary claims of employees’ leave credits. 

 

Item 4.0 of Civil Service Commission (CSC) - DBM JC No. 2, s. 2004 dated 

October 4, 2004, defines CTO as the number of hours or days an employee is excused 

from reporting for work with full pay and benefits. It is a non-monetary benefit 

provided to an employee in lieu of overtime pay pursuant to the adoption of austerity 

measure in the government. Itemized in the aforementioned circular are activities 

where overtime services can be authorized, of which, official travels that fell on 

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays are not included. 

 

Additionally, Section 7 of CSC-DBM Joint Circular No. 2,  s. 2015 dated 

November 25, 2015 provides the list of the government officials and employees who 

are not authorized to render overtime services with pay or compensation, one of whom 

are those who are on official travel status. 

 

Audit disclosed that travel orders wherein official travel dates fall on a Saturday, 

Sunday, or Holiday were granted either a one-day or half-day CTO each depending on 

the number of travel hours consumed. One BLGF Office Order granted all the 

personnel, who were included in the said travel order, except for incumbents of third 

level positions, a one-day CTO for those who will need both air and land travel 

exceeding four hours while those who will require travel time less than four hours on 

December 7, 2019, Saturday will be entitled to one-half day CTO.  

 

The grant of CTO is in lieu of overtime pay in accordance with CSC-DBM JC 

No. 2. However, verification of the daily time records of BLGF RO XI employees 

disclosed that there were compensatory overtime credits earned from their overtime 

on travel status in CY 2019, and balances were availed in the same year. 



 
 

51 

Thus, the claims of leave credits of various BLGF RO XI personnel against 

falsely earned CTOs overstated the balances of leave credits and equivalent value of 

such balances for the employees who utilized the said CTOs. 

 

We recommended that Management: (a) stop the grant of CTO on travel 

status; (b) deduct the CTOs availed by the BLGF RO XI personnel from their 

accumulated leave credits, and; (c) submit to the Audit Team the certified leave 

cards of said personnel reflecting the adjustments/deduction from their 

accumulated leave credits. 

 

Non-conduct of Physical Count of PPE 

 

6. BLGF ROs II, VII, XI and CO were not able to conduct the annual physical count 
of PPEs, thus, the existence of PPEs and correctness of the balances of affected 

PPE accounts were not fully ascertained. 
 

Section 38, Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM for NGAS provides that the entity 

shall have a periodic count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the 

RPCPPE at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor 

concerned not later than January 31 of the following year.  Equipment found at station 

and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting 

Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording. 

 

The CO, ROs II and XI were not able to conduct the required annual physical 

count of PPE, while RO VII that has conducted the physical count but was not able to 

complete it. 

 

Inquiry with the Management on reason/s for the non-conduct of physical count 

disclosed that (a) due to COVID-19 pandemic together with the adoption of the 

combination of Work From Home (WFH) and Work at Station arrangements have kept 

them from conducting the activity; and (b) failure on the part of RO VII to designate 

members of the Inventory Team and RO II’s non-creation of an inventory committee 

to conduct the physical count. 

 

The non-compliance by the mentioned offices with the provisions of the above 

regulations on the annual conduct of physical count of PPE, consequently, the validity, 

condition, and existence of the PPE could not be established. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) create an inventory 

committee for RO VII; and (b) conduct an actual physical count of PPE to 

ascertain its existence, as provided in Section 38, Chapter 10, Volume I of the 

GAM for NGAs.  

 

 



 
 

52 

Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts/Areas 

 

7. COVID-19-Pandemic Response and Recovery Interventions 
 

The BLGF had not received funds particularly for the COVID-19 response 

and/or recovery but has utilized its CY 2020 budget for related expenses. 

 

In the CO, COVID-19-related expenses charged to Personnel Services (PS) and 

Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) amounted to P90,500.00 and 

P0.575 million, respectively. The results of review of these COVID-related 

transactions are as follows: 

 

On the provision of services and supplies for hazard control 

 

Paragraph B, Section VI of Administrative Order (AO) No. 2020-0015 of the 

Department of Health (DOH) on Risk-based Public Health Standards Across Settings 

provides that at the minimum, all actors shall implement the prescribed interventions 

in various settings as presented under Annex A-Required Public Health Standards 

Across All Settings as of April 27, 2020, depending on their Risk Severity Grading.  

For each prescribed intervention, concrete examples of corresponding hazard controls 

(e.g., engineering control, administrative control, and Personal Protective Equipment) 

are provided. Column D-Offices/Workplaces of Annex A listed the administrative 

controls and PPE for offices/workplace, such as the provision of tissue, masks, among 

others.  In addition, CSC Memorandum Circular No. 10, s. 2020, dated May 7, 2020, 

provided alternative work arrangements, supporting mechanisms and general 

guidelines such as health/psychosocial interventions, disinfection or decontamination 

activities, implementation of minimum health standards protocol, etc., for government 

agencies to follow.  

 

Review of transactions for CY 2020 related to COVID 19 disclosed the 

following : (a)  liquidation of Cash Advance for the payment to Philippine Red Cross 

for the two batches of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test of P164,000.00 used for 

41 BLGF personnel, including janitorial and security booked under Medical, Dental 

and Laboratory Supplies Expense; (b) purchase of COVID -19 supplies of P195,570.00 

used during Skeletal and WFH Office Arrangements, including UV Care Pocket 

Sterilizer and UV Care Zap recognized under Office Supplies Inventory; and purchase 

of 10 boxes of face masks and three bottles of alcohol of P10,130.00, recognized under 

Office Supplies Expense.  

 

The above services and goods procured totalling P369,700.00 were compliant 

as to the above-cited rules and regulations and as to the prescribed documentary 

requirements pursuant to RA No. 9184 and its Implementing Rules and Regulation.  

 

 

 

 



 
 

53 

 On the grant of hazard pay to employees during the ECQ 

 

Section 1 of AO No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 of the Office of the President 

authorized the NGAs to grant COVID-19 Hazard Pay to personnel who physically 

reported for work during the implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantines 

(ECQ) in their respective work stations. Section 2 of the same AO provides the 

conditions on the grant of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay and that the heads of government 

agencies may grant the COVID-19 Hazard Pay to their personnel/workers without the 

need for further approval by the DBM, summarized as follows: 

 

1. The personnel are occupying regular, contractual or casual positions, or are 
workers engaged through Contract of Service (COS), job order (JO), or 

other similar schemes. 

 

2. The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work 
at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official working 

hours by the head of agency/office during the period of implementation of 

ECQ measures in the area of such office or work station. 

 

3. The total rate of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay shall be based on the number 
of days an employee/worker physically reports for work during the ECQ 

period using the formula under Section 1, which is P500.00 x No. of days 

physically reporting for work during the quarantine period. 

 

Section 3 of the same AO, on the other hand, provides for the applicable 

funding sources of such grant, particularly stating therein that amounts granted to COS 

or JO workers shall be charged against available MOOE allotments.  

 

Review of the transaction recognized under Hazard Pay for CY 2020 included 

COVID-19 hazard pay at P500.00/day granted to 38 regular/plantilla officials and 

employees and 12 COS personnel amounting to P60,000.00 and P30,500.00, 

respectively, who are attested to have been reporting during the ECQ (March 17 to 

May 15, 2020) and Modified ECQ (MECQ) (May 16 to 31, 2020), supported with 

attendance sheets and Office Orders. 
 

 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

 

8. Unaccomplished/partially accomplished planned GAD activities and absence of 
a GAD database had neither fully addressed the related gender issues nor 

provided inputs to GAD planning, budgeting, programming, and policy 

formulation, respectively. 

 

Section 36(a) of RA No. 9710, or the Magna Carta of Women, as supported with 

Section 31 of the General Provisions, General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020 

prescribe that government agencies shall formulate GAD Plan integrated in their 



 
 

54 

regular activities, which shall be at least five per cent of their budgets. In addition, 

Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014, specifies that the 

appropriate annual Accomplishment Report (AR) shall be submitted to the Audit 

Team, five working days from the end of January of the preceding year. 

 

For CY 2020, the BLGF’s GPB was submitted on November 18, 2020 within 

the prescribed deadline set from the receipt of their Philippine Commission on Women 

(PCW)-approved and endorsed GPB. However, the related AR generated from the 

PCW system, was submitted to the Audit Team only on March 11, 2021, or 34 days 

delayed from the deadline of submission on or before February 5, 2021. The submitted 

AR for CY 2020 was the draft and initial report submitted by BLGF to the PCW on 

March 11, 2021, the deadline set by the PCW. 

 

The consolidated GPB of the BLGF showed the total agency GAD budget for 

CY 2020 of P5.498 million equivalent to 2.88 per cent of the BLGF’s appropriations 

of P259.482 million based on the FY 2020 GAA. On the other hand, the actual 

expenditures per GAD AR amounted to P0.733 million or 13.33 per cent of the GAD 

Budget. Review of budget and actual expenditures disclosed the following 

observations: 

 

a. Unaccomplished/partially accomplished Activities 
 

Out of the 10 activities enumerated under the GPB, three were not 

implemented, six were partially implemented, and only one was completed. The low 

utilization of the GAD budget and the non-accomplishment of the planned GAD 

activities were due to several restrictions imposed in view of the current pandemic. 

The activities were mostly conducted via online engagements, while some were not 

fully implemented because of gatherings, travel and logistical restrictions.  

 

Several Audit Teams also noted the non-separation or particular designation of 

planned activities and accomplishments of the CO and each RO. In the absence of such 

separation or particular designation, Audit Teams found difficulty in ascertaining the 

activities and the cost of its implementation that are actually planned, budgeted, 

committed and incurred of the particular Unit.  

 

Both the untimely submission of GAD AR and non-segregation of activities of 

the CO and ROs had limited our audit. Additionally, although such low utilization of 

GAD funds and non-accomplishment of activities be currently rationalized with the 

effects of the pandemic, both still reflect that the GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) has 

not addressed several GAD issues outlined in its GPB and its mission to empower 

women to achieve gender equality. 

 

We recommended that Management instruct the GFPS to: (a) specifically 

identify the GAD activities and attributions per Office for proper determination 

of concerned BLGF- CO and ROs responsible in implementing such activities; 

(b) ensure that GAD Programs, Activities and Projects (PAPs) are implemented 



 
 

55 

as planned after due consideration and adjustment as to the effects of restrictions 

continuously imposed; and (c) maximize the utilization of the GAD funds to attain 

the objectives for which the funds were provided.  

 

b. Uncompleted Sex-Disaggregated Data and Gender Analysis 
 

Further perusal of the GAD AR, including the Gender Mainstreaming 

Evaluation Framework (GMEF), disclosed that several basic requirements were still 

partially attained as of CY 2020. The Bureau has yet to finalize its Sex-Disaggregated 

Data (SDD) as required under Section 4.4 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-001. 

It currently has a statistical data as to the population of the BLGF per age, gender, etc., 

but collection of other data e.g., number of solo parents, and other social indicators is 

still on-going. Moreover, despite the BLGF having conducted a GAD Learning 

Session for the Gender Analysis attended by selected employees, the Gender Analysis 

itself was only made through the GMEF. As such, it can be deduced that no gender 

analysis has been actually undertaken to fully identify and confirm existing gender 

issues, and neither has it been used in the development and enhancement of the 

BLGF’s GAD policies. The BLGF-CO, however, is aiming to address both matters in 

CY 2021, as also recommended by the PCW. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the GFPS to 

prioritize the establishment of the GAD Database or SDD and the conduct of 

Gender Analysis to be used in assessing and addressing the Bureau’s gender-

related issues. 

 

 

Senior Citizens (SC) and Persons with Disability (PWD) 

 

9. Non-formulation of plans, programs, and projects by the CO and ROs did not 

ensure that the concerns of SCs and PWDs were fully addressed. 

 

Section 32 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020 

provides that all agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and 

projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens (SCs) and persons with 

disability (PWDs), insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the 

same in their regular activities.  

   

For CYs 2017-2020, the BLGF CO did not formulate plans, programs and 

projects for SCs and PWDs.  However, in CY 2020 despite the absence of plans, 

programs, and projects, it was able to conduct several activities attributed to SCs and 

PWDs and has partially complied with prior year’s audit recommendation and 

established a disaggregated data on SCs but none for PWDs.  The ROs III, VIII, XI, 

XIII and CAR had plans, programs and projects but some were not able to implement 

fully the related activities due to quarantine restrictions and some LGU protocols, 

while ROs I, II, IV-A, IV-B, VI, VII, IX did not have plans and projects for SCs and 

PWDs. 



 
 

56 

 

The absence of plans, programs, projects and activities for SCs and PWDs 

hindered the delivery of benefits attributed to them in support of the government’s 

efforts in providing them the optimum benefits. 

  

We recommended that Management of: 

 

CO 

a) Establish a disaggregated data for the PWDs; 
 

b) Furnish the Audit Team copies of both the disaggregated data and

c) Formulate plans, programs and projects for SCs and PWDs, 
considering efficient utilization of funds allocated to facilitate the 

BLGF’s contribution to the government’s efforts in providing 

optimum benefits for the elderly and PWDs. 

 

 

10. Programs Related to Youth  
 

Pursuant to Section 33 of the General Provisions, GAA for FY 2020, the agency 

continued to engage youth and students to work immersions and on-the-job trainings. 

 

The BLGF RO IV-A has accepted three internees from the Philippine Women’s 

University who were oriented on the mandate of the BLGF and on the significance of 

local taxation in attaining LGU economic development for the national progress.  

However, the internship was disrupted by the imposition of the ECQ effective March 

17, 2020 wherein all classes and school activities in all levels were suspended due to 

the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

Likewise, BLGF RO-V deferred the conduct of specific activities for the youth 

to avoid crowd congregation given the COVID-19 threat. Onsite activities on this 

matter were postponed for the safety of both employees and participants. 

 

 

11. Tax Laws and Regulations, GSIS and Pag-IBIG Premium Contributions and 
Loan Amortizations, and PhilHealth Premium Contributions  

 

The BLGF complied with the withholding and remittances of mandatory 

deductions and loan amortizations, pursuant to the rules and regulations issued by the 

Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), 

Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth. For CY 2020, the withholding of taxes and mandatory

GSIS Property Insurance Law – RA No.656 

 

12. Uninsured PPE totalling P69.438 million as at December 31, 2020 exposed the CO 
and ROs to the risks of non-indemnification for any damage to, or loss of, 

properties due to fire, earthquake, storm, or other casualties. 

 

In order to indemnify or compensate the Government from any damage to, or 

loss of, its properties due to fire, earthquake, storm, or other casualty, RA No. 656 

otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law, as amended by PD No. 245, 

established the General Insurance Fund (GIF) placed under the administration of the 

GSIS.  The law requires that every government agency, except a municipal 

government below first class, is required to insure its properties, with the GIF against 

any insurable risk. 

 

Likewise, COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 prescribe the 

submission of the Property Inventory Form (PIF) as basis for the assessment of general 

insurance coverage over all insurable assets, properties and interests of the government 

with the GIF of the GSIS.  

 

Item 5.1(f) of the same Circular also requires that Head of government agency 

shall direct the pertinent official under his supervision to include in the agency annual 

budget the amount of premiums for the general insurance covering all insurable 

properties and other assets and ensure its payment to the GSIS. 

 

Inquiry with the Chief of Administrative Division of CO revealed that the 

agency has not conducted an actual physical count of PPE in CY 2020 due to the 

unforeseen and unexpected circumstances, i.e. community quarantines, skeleton 

workforce/work from home arangements, brought about by the pandemic resulting in 

the non-preparation and non-submission of the RPCPPE, consequently unabling the 

BLGF to prepare the PIF as it should be based from the data in the RPCPPE.  

  

However, further verification also disclosed that the CY 2020 Annual 

Procurement Plan (APP) of BLGF CO showed that insurance premiums for other 

insurable properties, except motor vehicles, were not included.  

 

Moreover, six ROs have not insured their motor vehicles due to various reasons: 

(a) there was no enough budget provided by CO to cover all the premium of insurable 

properties of the Agency; (b) non-provision of funds/budget for the payment of 

premium for the assets to be insured ; (c) they overlooked to implement the 

requirement to insure government properties with the GIF of GSIS; and (d) they still 

received no approval of funding for the insurance of assets and property despite 

repetitive efforts of including in the budget proposal. 

 

The insurable properties of CO and ROs which were not insured amounted to 

P69.439 million, as presented in Table 6.

RO XII Buildings, office equipment, ICT equipment, communication

15,649,433.39 

Total 69,438,511.43 

 

The absence of insurance coverage for all insurable properties of the BLGF 

exposed the government to the risks of non-indemnification for any damage to, or loss 

of, properties due to fire, earthquake, storm, or other casualties.    

 

We reiterated our recommendations and Management agreed to require 

the Property Officer to: (a) prepare the PIF as basis for the assessment of general 

insurance coverage; (b) secure immediately property insurance for all the 

insurable assets of the Agency which were not included in the insurance coverage 

or which have not been insured; and (c) request funds/budget to cover payment 

of premiums for the general insurance of all insurable properties and other assets 

and ensure its payment to the GSIS. 

 

Management Comment: 

 

The approval of the BLGF CO Order updating the composition of the Inventory 

Committee tasked to conduct the physical count of all PPEs is being facilitated. The 

Inventory Committee, in coordination with other offices concerned will conduct actual 

physical count on the 3rd quarter of FY 2021 and subsequently prepare the PIF. The 

BLGF CO will comply with the above recommendation to immediately secure for all 

the insurable assets as duly supported by the approved PIF.

Based on RO VI records, the unsettled disallowances are the unpaid portion of 

the personal liability of two former employees of the RO: one who resigned in CY 

2012, and another who transferred to other government agency in CY 2016. Both are 

still living in Iloilo City. It was likewise noted that demand for settlement of the 

remaining disallowance of the resigned employee was last made in CY 2016, while 

none was ever made on the transferred employee, resulting in overdue receivables 

aging from three to five years. 

 

Of the long overdue unsettled disallowances of RO XIII amounting to                         

P167,925.02,  the amount of P23,443.44 pertained to three persons liable who already 

retired from the service; P15,013.90 from an employee who transferred employment; 

and P129,467.68 from the former head of BLGF CARAGA who passed away.  Inquiry 

with the Bookkeeper disclosed that during the year 2020, they were not able to follow 

up or demand payments from the concerned persons liable of their unsettled 

disallowances.
