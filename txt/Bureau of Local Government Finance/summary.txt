C. Scope and Objectives of Audit 

 

The audit covered the financial accounts and operations of the BLGF for 

the year ended December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) verify 

the level of assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on 

the financial statements (FSs); (b) determine the propriety of transactions, 

as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules and 

regulations; (c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and (d) 

determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit 

recommendations. 

 
 

D. Audit Methodology 
 

We adopted a risk-based audit approach in the audit of the FSs of the BLGF 

and in the review of compliance with laws, rules and regulations.  The Audit 

Team which carried out the audit, among others: (i) examined financial and 

accounting procedures adopted by the BLGF and other relevant 

documentation; (ii) assessed internal controls regulating financial 

operations and carried out compliance testing for determining the extent of 

control in operation; (iii) conducted substantive testing of a representative 

sample of selected transactions;  (iv) carried out review, on test check basis, 

of transactions related to movements in balances of assets, liabilities, 

revenues and expenses; and (v) conducted interviews and held discussions 

with the concerned officials and staff of the agency. 

 

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and 

the concerned officials through the issuance of Audit Observation 

Memoranda. 

 
E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

A qualified opinion was rendered on the fairness of presentation of the 



 iii  

BLGF’s FSs as at December 31, 2020 due to material accounting errors and 

omissions that affected the balances of accounts Other Structures; Land 

Improvements; Information and Communication Technology (ICT) 

Equipment; Accumulated Depreciation; Due to BIR; Cash-Modified 

Disbursements System, Regular; Office Supplies Inventory; Due from 

NGAs; Semi-Expendable ICT Equipment; Semi-Expendable Furniture and 

Fixtures; Semi-Expendable Office Equipment; Computer Software; 

Donations in Kind; Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit); and expenses accounts 

reported in the FSs, as discussed in Part I - Independent Auditor’s Report 

and Part II - Observations and Recommendations of this report. 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

Among the audit observations and corresponding recommendations 

discussed in Part II of this report, the significant observations are 

summarized as follows: 

 

1. Various accounting errors and omissions in the keeping of accounts 
resulted in the misstatements of some assets, liabilities, equity and 

expense accounts in the FSs. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Officer-

in-Charge (OIC) Chief, Financial Management Division (FMD), and 

the Accountants of the ROs to: (a) prepare the necessary adjusting 

journal entries to correct the aforementioned errors and omissions; 

and, (b) observe the proper/correct recognition of accounts and 

transactions in accordance with the Government Accounting 

Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs) and 

other applicable rules and regulations. 

 

2. A number of accounts were either with unreconciled balances, 
discrepancies between and/or non-maintenance of accounting and 

property records, or not properly documented, thus, accuracy and 

reliability of the same cannot be fully ascertained. 

 

Unreliable balance of the Receivables-Disallowance/Charges – RO XIII 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the 

Bookkeeper to: (a) establish the correct balance of the Receivables-

Disallowances/ Charges by validating all the entries affecting the 

account against the available documents and ensure that 

transactions recorded therein were based on Notice of Finality of 

Decision and Notice of Settlement of 

Suspension/Disallowance/Charge (NSSDC) received, and  prepare 

adjusting journal entries for any errors or discrepancies that may be 



 iv  

noted; and (b) update the subsidiary ledger per person liable to 

support the general ledger balance of the Receivables-

Disallowances/Charges account based on the result of the 

reconciliation undertaken and prepare a monitoring schedule 

indicating all the necessary information on the status of settlement 

for each Notice of Disallowance (ND). 

 

Unreconciled discrepancy between CO books and Procurement Service 

(PS)-Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and National 

Printing Office (NPO) records 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the OIC 

Chief, FMD to: (a) deduct P265,074.00 from the reported balance of 

Due from NGAs – NPO as at December 31, 2020, and effect the 

necessary adjustment in Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit); (b) reconcile 

with the NPO the discrepancy of P1.392 million between BLGF-

Central Office (CO) books and NPO records representing 

undelivered items; (c) henceforth, reconcile regularly with the NPO 

to avoid misstatements in the recorded balance, and monitor the 

payments to and deliveries from the NPO; (d) reconcile with the PS 

the difference of P86,344.42 between BLGF-CO books and PS 

Statement of Account; (e) verify and reconcile with the PS the 

composition of the amount it deducted from the account Due to 

NGAs – BLGF CO aggregating P154,341.56, and make the necessary 

adjustment/s in the books. 

 

Property, Plant and Equipment (PPEs) transferred to RO IV-B not 

provided with proper valuation 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) require the 

Procurement Officer to coordinate with BLGF-CO and RIAT from 

(DBM) to provide the documents on the transfer of the PPEs without 

costs, and if not provided, refer to Section 6.2.12 of COA Circular 

No. 2020-006 for the proper valuation thereof; and (b) instruct the 

Acting Accountant and Procurement Officer to immediately 

reconcile the Report on the Physical Count of PPE and the PPE 

general ledger to arrive at reliable account balances. 

 

3. In RO VII, the deposit of collections from settlements of receivables 
from disallowances was recorded outright to Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit), which is not in accordance with COA Circular No. 

2020-001 and Section 47, Chapter 6, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs, 

thus remittances to the National Treasury under the account Cash-

Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular were not properly recognized in the 

books of accounts of the RO. 

 



 v  

We recommended and the Regional Director agreed to instruct the 

Senior Bookkeeper-Designate to use the proper account Cash-

Treasury/Agency Deposit, Regular, in recognizing the deposit of 

collections from settlements of disallowances in order to properly 

recognize in the books the remittances made to the Bureau of the 

Treasury. 

 

The aforementioned observations and the corresponding recommendations were 

communicated to concerned officials through the issuance of the CY 2020 

Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations (SAOR) in lieu of an 

exit conference.  Management has not submitted its response on the CY 2020 

SAOR and Summary of Prior Years’ Unimplemented Audit Recommendations, 

thus, its views and comments were not incorporated in the report.  

 

G. Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges 

For CY 2020, Notices of Suspension (NSs) and Disallowance (NDs) issued 
amounted to P6,589,050.73 and P42,500.00, respectively, while there were
