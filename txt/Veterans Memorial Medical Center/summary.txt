EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)	INTRODUCTION



The Veterans Memorial Medical Center (VMMC) was established in November 1955 through the grants-in-aid given by the United States (US) Government pursuant to public law 865, 80th U.S congress dated July 1, 1948, primarily for the hospitalization and treatment of the World War II veterans.



The definition of the veterans has been diversified through the enactment of Republic Act (RA) No. 9396 on March 18, 2007. The Center is now catering to all veterans who: (1) rendered military service in the land, sea or air forces of the Philippines during the revolution against Spain, the Philippine-American War, and World War II, including Filipino citizens who served with the Allied Forces in the Philippine territory; (2) was a member of the Philippine Expeditionary Forces sent to Korean War and the Philippine Civic Action Group sent to the Vietnam War; (3) rendered military service in the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and has been honorably discharged or retired after at least 20 years total cumulative active service or sooner separated while in active service in the AFP due to death or disability arising from wound or injury received or sickness or disease incurred in line of duty. The medical services have also been extended to the veteran’s dependents.



The VMMC is a civilian bureau under the administrative supervision of the Department of National Defense (DND) through the Administrator of Philippine Veterans Administrative Office (PVAO) under Letter of Instruction (LOI) No.19.

C)	SCOPE OF AUDIT



The audit covered the review on a test basis, the accounts of the VMMC for CY 2020. Our audit was made to assess the propriety of the financial transactions and compliance with laws, rules and regulations.



D)	INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT



An unmodified opinion was rendered on the fairness of the presentation of the financial statements (FS) of VMMC as of December 31, 2020.



E)	SUMMARY OF OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



1)	Various accounting errors and omissions were noted in the recording of transactions which resulted in the understatement of Accumulated Surplus/Deficit account by ₱3,651,415.97 and the overstatement of Property, Plant and Equipment, Accumulated Depreciation and Due to Officers and Employees accounts by ₱736,878.64, ₱700,034.71 and ₱3,688,259.90, respectively; thus, affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements (FS), contrary to the provisions of IPSAS 1.  (Observation No. 1)



We recommended that Management require the: (a) Accounting Section (AS) to prepare journal entry voucher (JEV) to correct the erroneous adjusting entries made; and (b) AS and Supply Section (SS) to coordinate on disposed unserviceable properties with incomplete description to properly ascertain and derecognize the same in the books.



2)	The (a) existence of long outstanding and/or dormant receivables amounting to ₱26,089,667.05, and (b) presence of 1,298 negative Subsidiary Ledger (SL) balances with an aggregate amount of ₱17,824,401.55 cast doubt on the fair presentation of receivables accounts in the FS. (Observation No. 2)



We recommended that Management require the AS to: (a) submit request for write-off of dormant receivables to COA for accounts that qualify for derecognition pursuant to COA Circular No. 2016-005; (b) exhaust all possible remedies to collect receivables from debtors; (c) reconcile negative SLs accounts pertaining to consigned medicines; (d) reconcile deductions made in the payroll of the guarantor employees (DOE) against the SL of the guaranteed civilian patients (AR) to  identify the amount for adjustment; and  (e) evaluate and analyze causes of negative SL balances and make necessary adjustments if warranted, to reflect correct account balances.



3)	The accuracy of the Due from GOCCs account with a balance of ₱94,674,874.96 at year-end is doubtful due to: (a) inclusion of long outstanding/dormant receivables from PhilHealth totaling ₱10,822,133.06 aged one to more than 10 years due to absence of monitoring and enforcement of collections thereof;                   (b) existence of negative SL balance of ₱430,898.12; and (c) unreconciled difference of ₱829,048.91 between the balance per books and per PITC records of fund transfers. (Observation No. 3)



We recommended that Management: (a) enforce collection of receivables from PhilHealth by sending demand letter and making a representation to inquire on status of claims; (b) require the AS to monitor the amount due from PhilHealth;  (c) evaluate and analyze causes of negative SL balances and make necessary adjustments, if warranted, to reflect the correct account balance; and (d) reconcile the balance of Due from GOCC - PITC and identify services that are already performed but not recorded in the books, if there are any.



4)	The physical existence and reliability of Inventory accounts amounting to ₱393,622,252.21 as of December 31, 2020 cannot be ascertained due to:                         (a) erroneous Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) for Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Inventory; (b) unreconciled balances of Supply Ledger Cards (SLC) and Stock Cards (SC) for Drugs and Medicines Inventory; and (c) presence  of non-moving or dormant balances of various Inventory items amounting to ₱39,149,925.60. Moreover, the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) and Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS) did not conform with the prescribed format under the Government Accounting Manual (GAM). (Observation No. 4)



We recommended that Management require the: (a) Inventory Committee (IC) to correct errors noted in the RPCI and submit to COA the revised RPCI as of December 31, 2020;  (b) AS and SS to coordinate, analyze and reconcile balances of accounting and inventory records, and effect necessary adjustments to reflect  correct balance of the account;  (c)  PS to fill out all data required in the RIS to ascertain validity and accuracy of reported issuances; and (d)  concerned personnel to use  the prescribed RSMI form pursuant to GAM. 



5)	The accuracy of the balance of Due to NGAs account amounting to ₱32,537,646.40 as of December 31, 2020 cannot be relied upon due to the discrepancy of ₱11,661,997.49 between the balance per books and the amount confirmed by the Philippine Veterans Affairs Office (PVAO) as balance of transferred funds to VMMC. (Observation No. 5)



We recommended that Management require the AS to reconcile the balance due to PVAO, identify payments made on patient’s reimbursement and confirm with PVAO submission of documents to support liquidation of funds received. 



6)	Additional cash advances (CAs) were granted to SDOs despite non-settlement of the previous CAs contrary to Section 89 of PD 1445. (Observation No. 6)



We recommended that Management: (a) stop granting additional CAs to SDOs, without liquidating first the previous CAs; and (b) comply with exiting regulation on the use of ADA to pay the PF of medical officers. 



7)	Absence of policy and procedure in the preparation of payroll and inadequate internal control on the issuance of clearance from money and property accountabilities to retiring/resigning employees resulted in: (a) overpayments of salaries and allowances to employees and Contract of Service (COS) personnel amounting to ₱853,917.07; and (b) existence of dormant/unsettled receivables from resigned and/or retired employees amounting to ₱2,101,632.90. (Observation No. 7)



We recommended that Management require the: (a) Financial and Management Division (FMD) to: i)  formulate policy on the recovery of overpayment from active and former employees of the Center; and ii) analyze root cause/s of overpayment; (b) Human Resource Section (HRS) to timely notify the payroll preparer on the tardiness, undertimes, or unofficial absences of employees; (c) AS to assess the collectability of overpayments from former employees; (d) CS to deduct the overpayment from salary of concerned employees until full recovery of amount; (e) AS to explain why clearance from money accountability was issued to employees even with unsettled accounts; (f) FMD to install adequate ICS in the issuance of  clearance to  retiring or resigning employees.  



8)	The Center’s non-observance of existing COA rules and regulations in the submission of required financial/budgetary reports within the prescribed period prevented the Audit Team from conducting timely review and evaluation of transactions and immediate correction of any deficiencies found therein. (Observation No. 8)



We recommended that Management require the: (a) AS and Budget Section to   ensure submission of required financial reports and statements to COA within the  prescribed period; (b) Supply Officer/Inventory Committee to submit the RPCPPE within the specified time frame; and (c) AS to submit non-cash JEVs within the deadline set. 



The foregoing findings and recommendations were discussed with concerned Management officials of the agency during the virtual exit conference on March 26, 2021. Management’s views and reactions were considered in the report, where appropriate.



F)	STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF PRIOR YEARS’ AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS



The 11 audit recommendations embodied in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report were fully implemented.  Details are presented in Part III of this report.
