A)	FINANCIAL AND COMPLIANCE



Non-submission of the Report on Physical Count of PPE



1)	The existence, accuracy, and completeness of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) amounting to P1.037 billion as of December 31, 2020 could not be established  due to non-completion of the inventory count, non-submission of the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE), and non-maintenance of the Property, Plant Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) contrary to the pertinent provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), thus, affecting the reliability and fairness of presentation of the PPE accounts in the financial statements.

		

In accordance with the provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), the following reports/forms shall be prepared, maintained and submitted:

To provide the guidelines and procedures in the conduct of physical count of PPE, recognition of PPE items found at station, and disposition for non-existing/missing PPE items, for the one-time cleansing of PPE account balances of government agencies, COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 was issued and published on January 12, 2021. This requires preparation of Physical Inventory Plan (PIP) containing, at least, the assignments/duties of the Committee members, cut-off date, and a schedule specifying the dates and locations of inventory-taking activities. 











The Property Plant and Equipment account of the University of Antique disclosed a balance of P948.739 million as of December 31, 2020, details of which are presented in Annex 1 and summarized as follows:

            P     1,037,269,335.76 



Verification of the PPE accounts disclosed the following:



1)	  The Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) as of December 31, 2020 was not prepared by the UA-Hamtic and UA - Tario Lim campuses for assets amounting to P146.946 million and P270.655 million, respectively. It was noted that Tario Lim Campus has never prepared the RPCPPE, while the last time Hamtic Campus conducted the inventory and submitted the RPCPPE was in 2014. According to the Supply Officers of the two campuses, they were able to conduct the inventory in the succeeding years but the report was never completed as to the details prescribed in the required new format of RPCPPE due to unavailability of information on a number of PPE items.

	

2)	  A variance of  P161.929 million was noted between the year end balances reflected in the financial statements and RPCPPE of UA - Main Campus as follows:



Balance per FS, 12/31/2020

P619,668,018.47

Balance per RPCPPE, 12/31/2020

457,739,413.11

Variance

P161,928,605.36



3)	 The balance of PPE in the UA Main Campus included properties amounting to P25.382 million which have been already disposed in the years 2016 - 2019, but was not deducted from the books. According to the Accountant they were not furnished copies of the disposal documents, thus these were not effected in the books. Likewise unserviceable properties amounting to P5.756 million were not disposed of and were still included in the PPE balance as of year-end.



4)	  Although the UA Main campus has prepared the PPELC, these were not updated and did not include assets acquired prior to 2017 because according to the accountant, source documents covering prior acquisitions were not available. Likewise, interview with the Accountant  revealed that they are not maintaining the PPELC for each item instead they are maintaining  schedules of PPE  per group of accounts, hence, determination of costs per item for purposes of reconciliation was not facilitated.



5)	  Property cards were prepared for all the three (3) campuses except that property cards for Hamtic campus did not include property acquisitions prior to 2018. The new Property Officer assumed office in the last quarter of 2019, and there was no turnover of records by the previous supply officer.   





The non-maintenance and non-updating of property reports, inclusion of disposed items and unserviceable items in the PPE account and variances noted between the RPCPPE and accounting books rendered the existence, completeness and accuracy of the PPE account balances reflected in the year-end financial statements unreliable, thus, the accounts were not fairly presented in the financial statements as of December 31, 2020. 



We recommended and management agreed that: 



1)	The University President in coordination with all Campus Directors, College Deans, Heads of Departments/Units and the Inventory Committee complete the conduct of the actual physical count, reconcile the report with the accounting records and submit the required RPCPPE within the prescribed deadline. A work plan with timelines and persons responsible for the conduct of these activities pursuant to COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 be prepared and submitted to the Auditor for monitoring purposes. 

      

2)	The Accounting Units of all campuses prepare and update regularly the required PPELC and coordinate with the Supply Office for the reconciliation with the PC.





Non-conduct of actual physical count of supplies and materials inventories and delayed submission of RPCI

	

2)	The inventory account of the UA could not be relied upon due to the noted variance amounting to P5.212 million between the accounting records and the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) of UA Main Campus, and the absence of physical count and non-submission of RPCI of UA-TLMC campus,  contrary to Paragraph 29(b) of IPSAS 1 and Section 12, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus affecting the assertions on existence, proper valuation and completeness as well as proper disclosure and the fair presentation of the Inventory Accounts in the year-end financial statements.



Paragraph 29 (b) of IPSAS 1 states that Fair Presentation requires an entity to present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information. Appendix A of IPSAS 1 on the point of view of Reliability requires that reliable information is where such information is free from material error and bias and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.

Section 12, Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government Agencies, Vol. I on Disclosure and Presentation, states that the financial statements shall disclose the total carrying amount of inventories, the carrying amount in classifications appropriate to the entity and the amount of inventories recognized as an expense during the period.













Moreover, Sections 14 to 16 of the same Manual prescribes the procedures to be followed and records to be maintained for recording, issuance, and transfer and/or disposal of inventory items.

Verification of the Inventory accounts disclosed the following:



1)	UA Main Campus has a total inventory balance of P20.183 million in the financial statement as of December 31, 2020, however, actual physical count per the submitted Report on Physical Count of Inventories registered a balance of only P14.971 million, thus a variance of P5.212 million.  According to the Supply Officer, the difference was mainly due to issuance of inventories to end users that was not timely recorded in the books. Interview with the Accountant also disclosed that the variance included prior year’s discrepancies which resulted from the non-turn-over of reports/documents by the previous in-charge. Efforts are being exerted to locate the pertinent documents to support the preparation of the JEV for recording of the adjustments in the books. 

















2)	UA TLMC campus has not conducted a physical count of its inventories, thus the existence and condition of inventories amounting to P9.557 million could not be substantiated. 



3)	There were no remaining/on hand semi expendable inventories in the possession of the Supply Officer of UA TLMC as of year-end but the financial statement showed a balance of  P3.443 million, thus could not be relied upon. Also included in this balance were inventories aggregating P3.098 million which have been issued to end users in CY 2018 as evidenced by Requisition and Issue Slips and Inventory Custodian Slips on file.



4)	The Report on Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) which is used to record issuances of inventories and provides basis for the preparation of the Journal Entry Voucher for recording in the books by the Accountant, were not regularly submitted by the campuses thus, adjustments were not timely effected in the books.

  

Section 7 of the GAM provides that when inventories are sold, exchanged or distributed, their carrying amount shall be recognized as expense in the period in which the revenue is recognized.  If there is no related revenue, the expense is recognized when the goods are distributed or the related service is rendered. Section 10 of the same Manual provides that tangible items (semi expendable property) shall be recognized as expenses upon issue to the end-user.



As a result of the above deficiencies, the existence, accuracy and completeness of the inventory accounts as presented in the yearend financial statements could not be relied upon. 

                       

 

We recommended and the Inventory Committee, Supply Officers, and Accounting Units of all campuses agreed to:



1)	Conduct actual physical count of inventories and promptly submit the RPCI and RSMI as provided in the GAM for National Government Agencies.

	

2)	Submit to the Auditor a work plan with timelines and persons responsible for the conduct of inventory taking.



3)	Effect the necessary adjustments to the affected semi expendable inventory accounts and expense accounts by debiting Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) and crediting the appropriate semi-expendable properties to recognize the issuance of inventory totaling P3.442 million in the books of UA TLMC.



	

	

	

	

	

Inactive/dormant loans receivable for the grant of StuFAP and SLAP

	

3)	Loans Receivable-Others amounting to P402,000.00 for the grant of Student Financial Assistance Program (StuFAP) and Student Loan Assistance Program (SLAP) to student borrowers since CY 2004 for University of Antique-Main Campus (UA-MC) were not supported by documentations and had been dormant for more than 10 years, rendering the receivable account unreliable.



In accordance with the Commission on Higher Education Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 4 s. 2004 dated January 26, 2004, the Student Financial Assistance Program (StuFAP) is a student loan program that shall cater to the financially needy 3rd, 4th-year and graduating students. The said student loan can be used for tuition and other school fees, books and course projects, thesis writings, board and lodging, graduation fees, and other valid educational expenses. 



Qualified borrowers may be allowed to borrow a maximum of P8,000.00 per semester covering the following financial benefits: school fees, course projects, board and lodging. Qualified borrowers shall not be charged any interest on their loan fund. Loans amounting to P4,000.00 and below are payable within five years and loans above P4,000.00 are payable within 10 years.



Review of the Status of Receivables of the University of Antique-Main Campus (UA-MC) revealed that the account Loans Receivable-Others, amounting to P402,000.00, remained inactive and became dormant. The amount is broken down as follows:





Date of Grant of Loan

Total



P

402,000.00





It was also noted in audit that these amounts recorded in the Loans Receivable-Others account were not supported by the following documents:



a)	Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and UA-MC;

b)	Schedule or Master-List of Student Borrowers, amount borrowed per student and the amortization schedules or loan repayments;

c)	Loan Agreements between the student/loan borrower and UA-MC; and

d)	Student loan borrower Ledgers.



The fund under Student Loan Assistance Program (SLAP) which, according to the UA-MC Accounting Office, was sourced from an Office of the Congressman also lacked the binding MOA, thus, the legal basis, conditions and procedures of the grant of loan to student borrowers as well as its collectability could not be determined rendering the receivable account unreliable.



    Record shows and interview with the Agency Accountant revealed that due to lack of  proper turnover of documents from previous in charge and poor filing system, there was no data available pertaining to the accountable student borrowers, hence, demand for collection could not be facilitated.  



     According to management, they are still reconciling the accounts after which a Request for Write-off of dormant accounts will be initiated, while the Student Affairs and Services Office, which is in charge of granting the loans to students will be tasked to prepare the necessary reports which will be the basis for the final amount for the request for write-off.



 Due to the foregoing, the collectability of loans from student borrowers, legal basis of demand and other objectives of the program are difficult to attain.



     We recommended and the management agreed that the University of Antique submit to the Office of the Auditor a Request for Write-off of Dormant Accounts supported by documents provided in the pertinent provision of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, after exhaustion of all means of recovering the receivable accounts.



Non-establishment of Internal Audit Service/Unit



4)	The management was not able to organize an Internal Audit Service/Unit contrary to Administrative Order No. 70 s. 2003 and DBM Circular Letter No. 2011-5 dated May 19, 2011, thus, sound system of internal control was not properly implemented and monitored.

 

Section 1 of the Administrative Order No. 70 dated April 14, 2003 states, “All heads of government offices, agencies, government-owned and controlled corporations, including government financial institutions, State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) and local government units, shall organize an Internal Audit Service (IAS) in their respective offices. Xxx”

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

      In accordance with Item 4.0 of Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Circular Letter No. 2011-5 dated May 19, 2011, “Pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 1445, “Government Auditing Code of the Philippines,” dated 11 June 1978, as amended, the Administrative Code of 1987, and existing Commission on Audit and DBM issuances, it is the primary responsibility of the Head of the Department/Agency to install, implement and monitor a sound system of internal control. To strengthen the internal control system, AO 278, s. 1992 and AO 70, s. 2003 mandated all heads of government departments and offices concerned, GOCCs, including GFIs, SUCs and LGUs, to organize an IAS/IAU in their respective offices.”  Xxx



The scope and functions of the IAS/IAU and implementing guidelines are explained in the Philippine Government Internal Audit Manual (PGIAM) as promulgated by DBM Circular Letter No. 2011-5. 





Evaluation of the organizational structure of the University showed that it has no Internal Audit Service/Internal Audit Unit (IAS/IAU).



The SUC’s Board Secretary commented that several representations were already made with the DBM for the creation of positions in the IAS. The position is already included in the Enhanced Revised Organizational Structure and Staffing Standards (ROSSS) and pending the approval of the DBM.



Without the IAS in the University, achievement of the objectives of sound system of internal control is not ensured like safeguarding of assets, checking the accuracy and reliability of accounting data, the efficient, effective, ethical and economical operations, compliance with laws and regulations, and adherence to managerial policies.



We recommended and the management agreed that the University President will make representations with oversight bodies like the Department of Budget and Management and the Civil Service Commission for the installation of the Internal Audit Service/Unit within the organizational structure of the University.





B)	COMPLIANCE WITH GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES



Non–submission of GAD Plan and Budget and Accomplishment Reports



5)	Gender and Development (GAD) Plan and Budget (GPB) and Accomplishment Reports for CY 2020 were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor contrary to COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014, thus, judicious use and the efficiency and effectiveness of interventions in addressing gender issues towards the realization of GAD objectives could not be determined. 



The responsibility of timely submission of GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and GAD Accomplishment Reports (ARs) is provided in Item V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 which states: “The Audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget to the COA Audit Team assigned to the agency within five (5) working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the PCW or their mother or central office, as the case maybe. Likewise, a copy of the corresponding Accomplishment Report shall be furnished the said Audit Team within five (5) working days from the end of January of the preceding year. Xxx”



The submission of the GAD reports is coursed through the Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS). It is the Philippine Commission for Women (PCW) online system which manages GAD profiles, GPBs and GAD ARs, as well as generates GAD-related reports.



Audit of GAD transactions revealed that the GAD Office of the University has not submitted the consolidated PCW-endorsed GPB and PCW-reviewed GAD AR for CY 2020 to the Office of the Auditor. The CY 2020 GPB was only submitted to the Office of the Auditor on May 20, 2020. Preparation of 2020 GAD AR was based only on the actual Programs, Activities and Projects (PAPs) implemented during the year with related attributions to gender and development. The 2020 GAD AR was already submitted to CHED ROVI for review, pending the submission to PCW. This will be submitted to COA after endorsement of the GAD AR by the PCW.



In CY 2020, total budget appropriations under the annual GAA of the University of Antique is P273.863 million, of which five percent or P13.693 million should be utilized and correspond to GAD-related PAPs. It is, however, difficult to ascertain whether the amount was really achieved in the preparation of plans and budget and if PAPs were implemented since no reports were submitted.

											

											The delayed submission of the required reports to COA deterred the timely evaluation of the use of GAD funds and the determination of the efficiency and effectiveness of interventions in addressing gender issues towards the realization of the objectives of the country’s commitments, plans, and policies on women’s empowerment, gender equality and GAD.

											

											According to the GAD focal person, the accomplishment report has been submitted to CHED for review after which it will be forwarded to PCW for approval in accordance with the guidelines.  The report will be submitted to COA as soon as it is returned by the PCW. 



We recommended that the SUC President, in coordination with the GAD Director and Campus Directors of external campuses:



a)	Abide with the pertinent GAD guidelines on the timely submission of approved GPB and GAD AR;



b)	Cause to follow-up with the CHED Regional Office VI or the PCW for the submission of the PCW reviewed GAD AR for CY 2020 for signature of the agency head, copy thereof to be submitted to the Office of the Auditor for verification.















































C)	COMPLIANCE WITH  TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS 



6)	The Agency had complied with BIR regulations as to the mandatory deductions on the salaries and wages of its personnel and on all purchase of supplies, materials and services needed in its operations including payments to contractors. Mandatory deductions are remitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) immediately on the month following the month for which these were deducted.

 

As stated in Note 13 of the Agency’s Notes to Financial Statements, Due to BIR account amounting to P3.700 million refers to taxes withheld by the University which were remitted to the BIR in January, 2021 (See Annex 2- Schedule of Taxes Withheld and Remitted to BIR on Compensation and from Suppliers).

Amounts were remitted to the respective government agencies on or before the due date on the month following the month for which these were deducted. 

During the year the balances of Due to GSIS, Due to Pag-IBIG and Due to PhilHealth amounted to P52,497.37, P9,954.61 and P11,973.37 respectively  which represents the unremitted balances as of year-end from previous years contributions and premiums of various employees.
