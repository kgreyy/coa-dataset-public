 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



I)	Introduction



The University of Antique (UA) started as a trade technical institution, the Antique School of Arts and Trades (ASAT), on January 19, 1954.  On November 14, 1982, Batas Pambansa 281 authorized the conversion of the school into a state college, the Polytechnic State College of Antique (PSCA). With the passage of Republic Act (RA) 8292, otherwise known as the “Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997,” and through CHED Memorandum Order No. 27, CHED-supervised institutions namely Antique College of Agriculture in Hamtic, Antique and Tario-Lim Memorial School of Fisheries in Tibiao, Antique, were integrated with PSCA.



The PSCA Board of Trustees, in its Resolution No. 105, series of 2000, approved the opening of extension classes on Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology (BSIT) Program in Semirara, Caluya, Antique effective school year 2000-2001 but the MOA was not renewed. Then the Board approved Resolution No. 201 series of 2002 to open the extension classes at the island Municipality of Caluya, Antique effective school year 2002-2003. UA-Caluya Campus now offers BSIT majors in Electrical Technology and Food Technology, BS in Entrepreneurship, and Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education. Starting school year 2018-2019, BS in Hospitality Management was added, making the program offerings to five.

	

Also, with Resolution No. 25, series of 2005, the Board approved the opening of extension classes in the Municipality of Libertad, Antique effective school year 2005-2006. Libertad campus is still in operation offering BS in Infotech and BS in Hospitality Management courses.



On November 10, 2009, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed RA 9746, an Act converting PSCA in the municipality of Sibalom into a state university to be known as the University of Antique (UA), which includes the external campuses in the municipalities of Hamtic and Tibiao.



Governance of UA is vested upon the Board of Regents, which exercises policy-making functions to carry out the mission and programs of the University by virtue of RA No. 8292.



UA is administered by SUC President Pablo S. Crespo, Jr., Ph.D., whose investiture was held on January 18, 2019, during the school’s 65th Foundation Day. He is assisted by three vice presidents:  the Vice President for Academic Affairs – Dr. Jelyn O. Alentajan; the Vice President for Research, Extension, Continuing Education and Training Services – Dr. Nanette V. Dionisio; and the Vice President for Administration and Finance – Dr. Ronilo A. Soriano, CPA.



The Campuses are under the leadership of the following Campus Directors: Main Campus – Dr. Nelly E. Mistio, Hamtic Campus - Prof. Noel M. Montaño, MAgDev., and Tario-Lim Memorial Campus (TLMC) – Dr. May T. Delgado. Extension Campuses are headed by Mr. Michael N. Iligan, for Caluya and Dr. Porferio S. Bangcaya for Libertad.

III)	Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the University of Antique for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to exceptions as stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report and as discussed in Part II of this Annual Audit Report.



The existence, accuracy and completeness of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) amounting to P1.037 billion as of December 31, 2020 could not be established due to  non-completion of the inventory count, non-submission of the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE), and non-maintenance of the Property, Plant Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) contrary to the pertinent provisions of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs), thus, affecting the reliability and fairness of presentation of the PPE accounts in the financial statements.





IV)	Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



Following are the other significant observations with the corresponding recommendations:



1)	The inventory account of the UA could not be relied upon due to the noted variance amounting to P5.212 million between the accounting records and the Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) of UA Main Campus, and the absence of physical count and non-submission of RPCI of UA-TLMC campus,  contrary to Paragraph 29(b) of IPSAS 1 and Section 12, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thus affecting the assertions on existence, proper valuation, completeness, proper disclosure and the fair presentation of the Inventory Accounts in the year-end financial statements.



We recommended and the Inventory Committee, Supply Officers, and Accounting Units of all campuses agreed to:



1)	Conduct actual physical count of inventories and promptly submit the RPCI and RSMI as provided in the GAM for National Government Agencies.

	

2)	Submit to the Auditor a work plan with timelines and persons responsible for the conduct of inventory taking.



3)	Effect the necessary adjustment to the affected inventory and expense accounts by debiting the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) and crediting the appropriate semi-expendable properties to recognize the issuance of inventory totaling P3.443 million in the books of UA TLMC.























2)	Loans Receivable-Others amounting to P402,000.00 for the grant of StuFAP and SLAP to student borrowers since CY 2004 for University of Antique-Main Campus (UA-MC) were not supported by documentations and had been dormant for more than 10 years, rendering the receivable account unreliable.



 We recommended and the management agreed that the University of Antique submit to the Office of the Auditor a Request for Write-off of Dormant Accounts supported by documents provided in the pertinent provision of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, after exhaustion of all means of recovering the receivable accounts.
