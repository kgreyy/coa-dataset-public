PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



FINANCIAL AUDIT

	Unreliable Cash account

	

1)	The Cash accounts totaling ₱9,502,743,499.02 was unreliable due to: a) deficiencies/inconsistencies noted in the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) and/or General Ledger (GL) balances; and b) unadjusted reconciling items and non-recording of releases of IT Fees. Moreover, Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) of LARES Escrow account (Mother Account) were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor since opening of the account sometime in 2008, contrary to Section 4, Chapter 21 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume 1.  



	1)	The Cash account has an aggregate balance of ₱ 9,502,743,499.02 as at year-end  consisting of the following:

	

Account

              Amount

Cash-Collecting Officers

₱     173,441,314.56

Petty Cash 

187,827.13

Cash - Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust

11,530,465.55

Total

₱ 9,502,743,499.02



a)		Deficiencies/inconsistencies noted in SL and GL balances 

	

   a.1)   Discrepancy of ₱145,553.95 between the GL and SL balance

	2)	Appendix 5(D), Volume II of the GAM states that controlling accounts in the GL shall be supported with details in SLs. Summary of SL of Cash Collecting Officers (CCO) submitted by Management revealed a discrepancy with the GL Balance as shown below.

	

General Ledger

    ₱     173,441,314.56

Subsidiary Ledger

 173,586,868.51

Difference

₱            145,553.95



	3)	Discrepancy between GL and SL balances indicates that erroneous postings were made either in the GL or SL which contributed to the unreliability of the account.

	4)	As observed in previous years, SL of Collecting Officers (COs) does not provide sufficient details. Transactions are lumped in one amount per month without breakdown which precluded the Audit Team from validating the details contrary to Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 which states that the accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government. 

	5)	The Bookkeeping Section is merely copying the details in the Cash Receipts Journal (CRJ) provided by the Revenue Section. We requested for daily breakdown of collections and deposits from the Revenue Section but was informed that the details are indicated in the RCDs and supporting documents submitted by COs. However, recurring deficiencies have been observed in the RCDs.  Though errors are detected, it  took some time before the system can adjust the same in the report. We also requested for the details of cash and check deposits that can be extracted from system generated report but the same has yet to be received as to date. 

	6)	Management informed that uploading of deposit slips and automatic verification of deposits with the statement of accounts (SOA) will be added in the  collection and deposit system, however,  as to date,  no enhancement has been made. Consequently, the system generated RCD still cannot be relied upon.

	7)	As of December 31, 2020, the SL balances of 24 NCR COs did not reconcile with RCDs submitted by COs. Moreover, some collections and deposits of 23 NCR COs did not reconcile with the CRJ for December 2020. Had the Accounting Division maintained detailed collections and deposits as support to the monthly postings, reconciliation of the same could be facilitated and any discrepancies could be adjusted immediately in the books of accounts. 

	8)	In addition, the Revenue Section is still using reference numbers in CRJ that can only be found in their report. This has been observed in previous audit, however, the submitted RCD to the Audit Team still did not contain reference number. Coordination should have been made with LARES, Inc. to enhance the system generated report that will include a unique reference number for each RCD. The reference number should be traced in all copies of RCD and not only those in the Revenue Section.

	

	a.2)    Presence of negative balances in SLs of Accountable Officers (AOs) totaling

         ₱4,869,828.78

	9)	Scrutiny of SLs disclosed that 76 Collecting Officers have negative balances ranging from negative ₱.01 to negative ₱859,764.35 or a total of negative ₱4,869,828.78.  Hereunder is the summary of AOs with corresponding negative balances per Region.

	10)		Impliedly, the negative balance in the account of the AOs means that overage or error was committed in reporting and/or postings of transactions which was left unreconciled and not investigated upon. 



	11)		The existence of negative balances for years now casts doubt on the fair presentation of the Cash-Collecting Officers account in the financial statement and indicates weakness in cash management. 

	

	12)		We recommended that Management:



a)	diligently work back on previous records/reports and reconcile with concerned Collecting Officers (COs) records.  Thereafter, effect necessary adjustments to correct unreconciled balances among  General Ledger (GL), Subsidiary Ledgers (SL) and <a href="https://www.coa.gov.ph/phocadownload/userupload/ABC-Help/Financial_Management_Brgy/Annex9.1.2.htm">Report of Collections and Deposits</a> (RCD) including negative balances in the books to present an accurate amount in the financial statements and its supporting records; and 



b)	coordinate with LARES, Inc. to facilitate completion of the system that will present a reliable RCD and likewise include  report number  of RCD as reference of the Accounting Division in their Cash Receipts Journal (CRJ).  Meanwhile, pending completion of the system, maintain detailed breakdown that will support monthly postings in the SL and CRJ.









       Management Comment



	13)	The Accounting Division shall continue reconciling the accounts/records of COs. Letters and/or Memorandum will be issued to direct the CO to reconcile their accounts with the Revenue Section, Accounting Division.



	14)	The recommendation was already coordinated and discussed with LARES, Inc. in different online meetings.



	15)	Regarding detailed breakdown of collections and deposits, the Revenue Section is already maintaining the same.



b)		Unadjusted reconciling items and non-recording of releases of IT Fees

	

	b.2)   Unadjusted reconciling items shown in the BRS totaling ₱228,385,034.43

	17)	Section 6, Chapter 21 of GAM, Volume I, states that: Recognition of Adjustments.  The Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall prepare a JEV to recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the books of accounts.

	

	18)	According to the Bookkeeping Section, the Retention Fees pertaining to LOI #347-355 were not immediately recorded in the books due to timing difference which will cause a negative balance in the PNB1611447TAO1 LARES Escrow (Mother Acct). This is doubtful in the sense that collections nationwide were deposited the following day.  The cause of the negative balance redound to the possibility that collections are not recorded immediately in the books and failure to reconcile book balance with that of the bank balance. This matter is discussed in the observation  pertaining to non-preparation by the Accounting Division (AD) and non-submission of BRS to the Audit Team.  Based on the logbook of the Accounting Division, the Letter of Instruction (LOI)  was  received in December 2020.  Correspondingly, Official Receipts (ORs) were issued by LARES, Inc.

	

	19)	The non-recording of  reconciling items in the books has grossly affected the Cash in Bank – Local Currency Current Account. Similarly, several accounts were likewise affected as follows:

Management Comment



	21)	Management has not yet commented on this observation.

	

	b.3)   Unrecorded Release of IT Fees and Retention Fees withheld in the 

	                 LARES Escrow Account

	

	22)	As shown in the preceding table, there were unrecorded retention fees in PNB1611447TAO3 LARES Escrow Account (Subsidiary Account) which pertains to LOI No. 347-355 dated August 25, 2020 to November 26, 2020.  Due to this omission, the Cash in Bank Local Currency Current Account,  Other Payables, Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable and Due to BIR amounting to  ₱998,080,772.49, ₱1,064,619,490.66, ₱8,813,953.43 and ₱66,538,718.17, respectively, were not recognized in the books.

	

	23)	Section 10.02 of the BOO Agreement between LRA and LARES, Inc. states that any and all payments made to the PROJECT PROPONENT under this Agreement shall be subject to a retention fee of five percent.  Such retention shall be based on the total amount due to the PROJECT PROPONENT prior to any deduction, and shall be taken from every progress payment until the end of the first year of operation or until such time as funds accumulated for retention fee has reached the average annual projected cost of operation, maintenance and repair as specified by the PROJECT PROPONENT in its tender documents, whichever comes first. The funds accumulated for the retention fee may be used by the PROJECT PROPONENT to undertake necessary and appropriate repairs and maintenance of the project in accordance with the design and performance standards prescribed in operating parameters in order to ensure that the IT Facilities operate at the desired level of service. The fund will be maintained at the minimum balance equal to the annual projected cost of maintenance and repair. As such, any drawdown from the fund will be replenished through a resumption of collection of retention fee. The aforementioned retention money shall be deposited for the account of the PROJECT PROPONENT in a bank agreed upon by PROJECT PROPONENT and LRA, which bank shall hold the same in escrow in favour of the government. The interests earned shall accrue to the funds accumulated for the retention fee.

	

	24)		Logically, based on the above provisions, when retention fee is withheld by LRA, there were releases of IT fees to LARES, Inc. from the PNB1611447TAO1 LARES Escrow (Mother Acct).  The accounting record showed that the last release of retention fee to LARES was made under LOI No. 346 dated July 22, 2020 through JEV No. 01-2020-12-134(BS) dated December 31, 2020.  However, we learned that there were succeeding nine LOIs released such as LOI Nos. 347 to 355, for the months of September to December 2020.  The copy of LOIs proved that payments/releases of IT Fees from PNB1611447TAO1 LARES Escrow (Mother Acct) were made and the same were not recorded in the books as follows:

	25)	The above table showed that these were indeed releases of IT Fees from the LARES Escrow account totaling ₱998,080,772.49 and tax withheld totaling ₱66,538,718.17 from October 22 to December 22, 2020.  Verification of accounting records showed that no JEVs were prepared to record  the releases from LARES Escrow account.   Meaning, the non-recording of these releases in the books resulted in the overstatement of Cash in Bank, LCCA and Other Payables by ₱998,080,772.49 and ₱1,073,433,444.09, respectively, and the understatement of Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable and Due to BIR by ₱8,813,953.43 and ₱66,538,718.17, respectively.

	

	26)	We recommended that Management effect necessary adjusting/correcting entries for unrecorded releases of IT fees from the LARES, Inc. Escrow account.



       Management Comment



	27)	Management has not yet commented on this observation.



Non-preparation and submission of BRS for LARES Escrow Account



	28)	LARES Escrow Account was composed of PNB Bank Account Nos. 1611447TAO1 to 1611447TAO4. Of these mother and subsidiary accounts, only the PNB1611447TAO3 LARES Escrow (Subsidiary Account) BRS is  being submitted to the Audit Team every quarter.



	29)	According to the Accounting Division, the agency has no control over PNB Bank Account Nos. 1611447TAO2 and 1611447TAO4 as these are being controlled by the Project Proponent from the opening of the bank account sometime in CY  2008. The Audit Team  had requested documents to validate the purpose of different subsidiary and mother accounts, however, as to date no documents have been submitted by Management. 



	30)	As to PNB Bank Account No. 1611447TAO1, the mother account, Management explained that due to complexity and voluminous transactions, preparation of BRS was neglected. It was noted that the BRS for this account for CYs 2019 to 2020 have  not been submitted. This account is utilized for collections of IT Fees of all COs nationwide.  Non-preparation of BRS is contrary to Section 4, Chapter 21 of GAM, Volume I which states that: The monthly BRS shall be prepared by the Chief Accountant/designated staff for each of the bank accounts maintained by the agency/entity using the Adjusted Balance Method. x x x

	

Moreover, Section 74 of the State Audit Code of the Philippines (PD No. 1445) states that: Monthly reports of depositories to agency head. At the close of each month, depositories shall report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition of the agency account standing in their books. The head of the agency shall see to it that a reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the reports and the balance found in the books of the agency. (emphasis ours)

	

	31)		As a result, the Cash in Bank balance pertaining to the said bank accounts were not verified. The reconciling items, if any, cannot be identified so that appropriate adjustments can be immediately reflected in the books of accounts.

	

	32)		The Notes to Financial Statements disclosed that PNB Bank Account No. 1611447TAO1 has a book balance of ₱619,817,481.08 as of December 31, 2020. However, if all LOIs mentioned above were recorded in the books, these would result in a negative balance of ₱315,637,779.70 computed as follows:



	Particulars

	Amount

	PNB Bank Account no. 1611447TAO1

	₱              619,817,481.08

	Add: Unrecorded deposits

	62,625,511.71

	Less: Unrecorded releases

	 (998,080,772.49)

	Balance after adjustments

₱           (315,637,779.70)



	33)		This only indicates that there are great possibilities that various errors such as non-recording of deposits and releases of IT Fees may have been committed and remained undetected through the years. Had the BRS been prepared regularly, reconciling items can be recognized immediately through  appropriate adjustments in the books of accounts.

	

	34)		We recommended that Management prepare and submit the BRS for PNB Bank Account No. 1611447TAO1 (mother account) and prepare necessary adjustments for reconciling items, if any, to present an accurate balance of the Cash –in-Bank, Local Currency Current Account. Subsequently, submit the same to the Audit Team for audit purposes.

	

Management Comment

	

	35)		The Accounting Division will exert best efforts to reconcile the PNB Escrow Account. Accordingly, they find it difficult and it will take some time to conduct reconciliation considering the volume of transactions that enters the escrow account on a daily basis.

	

	

	Non-reconciliation of CO’s records with SL maintained by the Accounting Division



2)	The cashbook balance or established accountability of collecting officers as of cash examination date did not reconcile with Subsidiary Ledger (SL) balance due to absence of periodic reconciliation between the records of Collecting Officers and that of the LRA Accounting Division as required in COA Memorandum No. 2013-004.  



	1)	Reconciliation of records of AO and the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) maintained by the Accountant aims to prove the accuracy of both records.



	2)	Comparison between the SL balances and that of the Cashbook balances or established accountability of some Collecting Officers (COs) as of cash examination date in various RoDs disclosed discrepancies as follows:

	3)	Had COs observed the regular preparation of BRS as provided in COA Memorandum No. 2013-004, the difference could have been explained and settled at once.  Absence of immediate and regular reconciliations between Cashbook and SL balances resulted in out-of-date cash balances at the end of the year which could be difficult to reconcile with the passage of time.



	4)	We recommended and Management agreed to require both Collecting Officers (COs) and the Chief Accountant of LRA Main Office to exert efforts to immediately reconcile the difference between balances of their respective records. Further, a quarterly reconciliation of accountabilities must be done to ensure accurate and reliable balances.





Non-recognition of revenue from computerized LRA System for Anywhere-to-Anywhere (A2A) capability transactions



3)	Non-recording of revenue amounting to ₱6,396,190.00 for CY 2020 was contrary to Paragraph 19 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 9 on Revenue from Exchange Transactions and Section 2.a, Chapter 2 of GAM, Volume I which understated the Accounts Receivable and Registration Fees accounts by the same amount. 



	1)	Section 2.a, Chapter 2 of the GAM, Volume I, provides that, accrual basis means a basis of accounting under which transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in the accounting records and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. The elements recognized under accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenue, and expenses.



	2)	Paragraph 19 of IPSAS 9 on Revenue from Exchange Transaction provides that, when the outcome of a transaction involving rendering of services can be estimated reliably, revenue associated with the transaction should be recognized by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. The outcome of a transaction can be estimated reliably when all the following conditions are satisfied:



a)	The amount of revenue can be measured reliably;

 

b)	It is probable that the economic benefits or service potential associated with the transaction will flow to the entity;



c)	The stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date can be measured reliably; and



d)	The costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably.

	3)	The LRA with the Land Registration Systems, Inc. (LARES) as private proponent is implementing Land Titling Computerization Project (LTCP) under RA No. 7718 or the Build-Operate-Transfer Law. It is a major Information Technology Project meant to secure land ownership. The implementation of LTCP allowed private corporations or banks to have customized solutions such as allowing data, in electronic form to be shared among different LRA Offices through the “anywhere-to-anywhere (“A2A”) capability of the computerized LRA system.



	4)	One of the customized solutions was officially referred to as the LRA Extension Office Project or Solution which allowed contracting parties/entities-banks  to secure access and cause the issuance of certified true copies of titles and documents stored in different computerized Registries of Deeds, from their Head Office, through the LTCP Nationwide Network.



	5)	LRA entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with contracting parties/entities, such as banks, government and private entities, to set-up, operate and maintain the LRA Extension Office in the premises of the clients to receive, process and issue LRA approved certified true copy of Certificates of Title using the A2A capability of the computerized LRA system.



	6)	One of the responsibilities of LRA is to issue Statement of Accounts (SOAs) to contracting party/entity-bank. These SOAs included LRA Fees on services rendered as mentioned. However, audit disclosed that SOAs were only recorded upon collection and not in the period services were rendered contrary to Paragraph 19 of IPSAS 9 –Revenue from Exchange Transactions.



	7)	SOAs issued to contracting party/entity-bank from January to December 2020 amounted to ₱7,291,003.00 of which  ₱894,813.00 was collected and recorded in the books thereby leaving a balance of ₱6,396,190.00. It was noted that the balance has not been recorded as of December 31, 2020. As previously observed by the Audit Team, there was difficulty in identifying the period for which payment was made. Inquiry with CO revealed that some contracting parties/entities-banks did not attach the billings/SOAs to support their payments; thus, the kind of service and billing period could not be determined. Hereunder is the summary of SOAs issued and corresponding collections in CY 2020.

*for LRA Extension Office Project only





	8)	Examination of transactions revealed that all conditions were satisfied to recognize services as revenue during the period it was rendered, to wit: First, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably as LARES thru its Philippine Land Registration and Information System (Philaris) was able to measure all transactions on a real-time basis; Second, the flow of economic benefits was almost guaranteed as parties/entities were required to pay LRA; Third, the moment Philaris transmits to LRA Extension Office CTCs of titles, services was deemed completed and can be measured reliably; and Lastly, cost incurred for the transaction was borne by parties/entities and not by LRA.



	9)	Despite meeting all aforementioned conditions and considering that LRA is on an accrual basis of accounting, Accounts Receivable and Registration Fees were not recorded in the appropriate period, thereby understating both accounts. Non-recording of receivables from contracting parties/entities in the books is a manifestation of poor monitoring of collections which resulted in unrecorded revenues and receivables. Likewise, sending of demand letters has not been acted upon.



	10)	Management however disclosed their desire to correct this practice. It is informed that one of the reasons of their failure to promptly record these transactions was their inability to access Philaris which enable the Revenue Section to download transactions real-time and to record registration fees accordingly.



	11)	We recommended that Management:



a)	account all uncollected amounts from contracting parties/entities, maintain a subsidiary ledger (SL) for each contracting party/entity, and prepare corresponding journal entries for appropriate adjustment in the books of accounts;



b)	record the billings for LRA Extension Office under Accounts Receivable and Registration Fees; and



c)	request from LARES full access to Philaris for transactions of LRA Extension Office. 











Management Comment



	12)	The Revenue Section is already maintaining SL/monitoring sheet for each Extension Office and in the process of reconciling uncollected amount after which the corresponding journal entries will be prepared.



	13)	The recommendation of the good auditors has been complied with. The Revenue Section is already recording registration fees due from LRA Extension Offices upon issuance of SOA.



	14)	The recommendation of the good auditors was already discussed with LARES. The Accounting Division will coordinate with the Information and Communication Technology Division to determine the best course of action and for eventual implementation of the recommendation.





Unreliable Inventory Account



4)	The balance of the Inventory account totaling ₱62,158,272.31 was unreliable due to: a) accounting errors totaling ₱1,328,144.95; b) unaccounted returned Judicial Title Forms (JTFs) from Registries of Deeds; c) non- reconciliation of Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) for Office Supplies Inventory with the General Ledger (GL) and non-updating of SLCs for various Inventory Accounts by LRA and non-submission of Report on Physical Count Inventory (RPCI) by LRA CARP for  Semi Expendable Equipment; d) non-preparation of Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) for issuances totaling ₱372,496.01; and e) 883 Requisition and Issue Slips (RIS) for accountable forms not fully accomplished.  Moreover, lost JTFs were not immediately circularized to all Register of Deeds (RoDs) nationwide; thus, increasing the risk of fraudulent use of said forms. 



a)	Accounting errors totaling ₱1,328,144.95 



i)	Erroneous recording of delivery of Office Supplies Inventory



	1)	Verification of JEV No. 03-2020-02-22(BS) dated February 29, 2020, revealed that erroneous recording of delivery of Office Supplies Inventory  was made upon recognition of delivered items from PS-DBM under Delivery Receipt (DR) No. M20-001372-CSE. This transaction was taken up as Office Supplies Inventory amounting to ₱1,214,730.24 instead of ₱870,009.77 which resulted in the overstatement of Office Supplies Inventory amounting to ₱344,720.47 and the understatement of Due from National Government Agencies by the same amount.



ii)	Misclassification of Computer Software to Office Supplies Inventory           amounting to ₱403,114.48.



	2)	Audit of JEV No. 03-2020-05-51 dated June 20, 2020 disclosed that the following delivery of licenses was recognized as Office Supplies Inventory instead of Computer Software, contrary to the Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) as updated (2019). Details are as follows:

	3)	As described in RCA (2019), Computer Software is debited to recognize purchase cost or capitalized development cost of computer software programs for use in government operation, when the software is not an integral part of the related hardware. Development costs include cost of coding, testing and cost to produce product masters. This account is credited upon sale, transfers, obsolescence, and/or adjustments.



	4)	The misclassification resulted in the overstatement of Office Supplies Inventory account by ₱403,114.48 and the understatement of the Computer Software account by the same amount.



iii)	     Misclassification of Semi Expendables-Office Equipment to Office Equipment amounting to ₱26,250.00.



	5)	Audit of JEV No. 03-2020-02-023 dated February 29, 2020 disclosed that the delivery of 125 pieces LED T8 Glass Tube amounting to ₱187.50 each, was recognized as Office Equipment instead of Semi-Expendable Office Equipment which is not in conformity with the updated RCA (2019).



	6)	Chapter 10, Volume I of the GAM states that: Section 4. Applying the Capitalization Threshold of ₱15,000.00. The capitalization threshold of ₱15,000.00 represents the minimum cost of an individual asset recognized as PPE on the Statement of Financial Position a) x x x b) This threshold shall be applied on an individual asset or per item basis. Each item within the bulk acquisition with aggregate or total value of PPE, such as library books, computer peripherals and small items of equipment will need to meet capitalization threshold to be recognized as PPE.



	7)	The misclassification resulted in the overstatement of the Office Equipment account by ₱26,250.00 and the understatement of Semi Expendables - Office Equipment  by the same amount.









iv)	Double recording of transactions amounting to ₱521,560.00.



	8)	Post audit of various JEVs disclosed the following entries made by the Accounting Division:

	9)	The preceding table shows that delivery of Thermoguns was recorded twice. Records also showed that various accounts such as Office Supplies Inventory, Semi-Expendable ICT Equipment and Semi-Expendable Office Equipment, were used inconsistently for deliveries and issuances of Thermoguns.  The erroneous recordings resulted in the overstatement of Office Supplies Inventory and Accounts Payable both by ₱521,560.00.



v)	Unissued Judicial Title Forms (JTF) amounting to ₱ 32,500.00 was included in the RSMI while two issuances of JTFs were unsupported



	10)	In the audit of issuances of JTFs, it was discovered that Management is using the same RIS number for those RoD using the manual system though it pertained to different persons receiving documents.

		

	11)	Verification of RSMI for JTFs for the month of October 2020 revealed that 500 pieces of JTFs amounting to ₱32,500.00 which are still unissued were already included in RIS No. 20-10-012 with 1,000 pieces issued JTFs. Upon verification of  the actual RIS, only 500 pieces were issued during the year while the other 500 pieces were issued only on January 21, 2021. Management reasoned out that 500 pieces JTFs were segregated as buffer stock for potential request. Nonetheless, the inclusion in the RSMI without actual issuance of forms was contrary to Section 9, Chapter 8, Volume 1 of the GAM which states that in Perpetual Inventory Method, supplies and materials purchased for inventory purposes shall be recorded using the perpetual inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a running total for the cost of goods sold in each period.  The system requires accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times through maintenance of the SLC (Appendix 57) by the Accounting Division/Unit and Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit for each item in stock. Regular purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for supplies and materials purchased out of PCF for immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the appropriate expense accounts. (Emphasis supplied)

		

	12)	In addition, two JTFs included in the RSMI were not supported with RIS.  RIS No. 20-07-084 was reported in the RSMI for the month of July 2020. Verification of supporting documents revealed that said RIS is composed of multiple issuances to RoDs as indicated below.

RoD

No. of JTFs Issued

500

Dapitan City

Total

	13)	Based on the above table, only 998 JTFs were issued, or a difference of two JTFs which pertained to spoiled JTFs according to Property Officer.  To further verify, we requested that spoiled forms be presented to the Audit Team, however, as to date, the same has not been presented. 



	14)	We recommended that Management: 



a)	 make necessary adjustments/reclassification of accounts to correct the balance in the financial statements. Further, direct the Accountant and Property Officer to be cautious in recording acquisitions and issuances of inventories;



b)	exert/exhaust all efforts to locate two missing JTFs and present the same to the Audit Team; and

	

c)	ensure that all requisitions are supported with RIS sequentially/serially numbered for identification purposes.



Management Comment



	15)	The adjustment will be made and the corresponding JEV will be immediately submitted to the Office of the Auditor.



	16)	The Property and Supply Section is exerting best efforts to locate the two JTFs. This will be immediately presented to COA once located.



	17)	The Property and Supply Section shall comply with the recommendation.









b)	Unaccounted returned JTFs in the Registries of Deeds (RoDs)

	18)	Verification of the implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations disclosed that Management has not finished its accounting of returned accountable forms by the RoDs. 



	19)	As reiterated in previous years Annual Audit Report, the accountable forms were found in stock which were previously issued but returned by RoDs in line with the implementation of the Philippine Land Registration and Information System (PHILARIS) or computerized system using new or revised accountable forms.  However, currently these returned forms specifically JTFs were being reissued to RoDs who are still utilizing the manual system.



	20)	It is manifested that accounting of these returned forms are still not being prioritized considering that the recommendation is not implemented in two years already. The failure of Property Section and Accounting Section to account the movement of these forms resulted in the understatement of the Accountable Forms Inventory account by an undetermined amount.



	21)	The laxity on the part of the custodian to exercise precautionary measures in the control, safekeeping and accounting of accountable forms particularly JTFs, may result in unnecessary and continuing litigations in court due to conflict in ownership over one’s property.



	22)	We recommended that Management complete the inventory taking of JTF to account for the returned and reissued forms and submit inventory report to the Accounting Section for corresponding adjustments in the Inventory account.  Henceforth, ensure diligent safekeeping of accountable forms to prevent loss and misuse.



Management Comment



	23)	The inventory of judicial title forms is still ongoing and being done by one staff of the Property and Supply Section.



c)	Unreconciled SLC of Office Supplies Inventory with GL Account, non-updating of SLCs for various Inventory Accounts and non-submission of RPCI by LRA CARP for Semi Expendable Equipment

	24)	Appendix 57 of GAM, Volume II provides that, SLCs shall be maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit for each kind of supplies and materials and transactions shall be posted promptly from source documents. 



	25)	Inquiry with the Bookkeeping Section revealed that SLCs of LRA for Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory, Semi-Expendable Office Equipment, Semi-Expendable ICT Equipment and Semi-Expendable Furnitures and Fixtures were not updated. It was noted that the last entries made in SLCs were for the year 2019, which is not in keeping with the Instruction in the preparation of SLC as stated above.



	26)	On the other hand, SLCs for Office Supplies Inventory account were updated. However, when traced to the controlling account, we noted that there was a discrepancy of ₱5,817,391.88 between balances per SLCs and per GL, computed as follows:



	Total balance of Supplies Ledger Cards, 12/31/2020

₱ 13,022,178.75

	Total balance of Office Supplies Inventory per GL, 12/31/2020

	   18,839,570.63

	Difference

	(₱  5,817,391.88)



	27)	Moreover, negative unit cost, negative quantities and negative balances existed in SLCs of 54 supplies, casted doubt on the reliability and accuracy of SLC balance for Office Supplies Inventory account. It was also observed that SLCs for Office Supplies Inventory account were only prepared after the end of the year instead of updating it every time transactions are made, contrary to Item C of Appendix 57, Volume II of GAM which states that, transactions shall be posted promptly from source documents.



	28)	Had SLCs been maintained and transactions been promptly posted, the matching/reconciliation of inventory items in stock of the Property Section would result in reliable presentation of Inventory account in the financial statements.  Item D of Appendix 57, Volume II of GAM requires that the agency shall conduct physical count of inventories every semester. The semestral physical inventory of supplies shall be reconciled with SLCs and controlling accounts and Supply and/or Property records. Any discrepancies shall be immediately verified and adjusted.



	29)	The non-updating of SLC as well as the late postings of transactions  contributed in the difficulty in the reconciliation of property and accounting records. As of December 31, 2020, the total discrepancy of ₱8,583,189.64 existed between RPCI and book balance of LRA as shown below.

	*for LRA only

	30)	Further, the LRA CARP did not submit RPCI for its Semi-Expendable Office Equipment and Semi-Expendable-Furniture and Fixtures, contrary to Section 17 (i) of the GAM, Volume I or Annex 66 of the GAM, Volume II which provides that the RPCI shall be submitted to the COA Auditor concerned not later than July 31 and January 31 of each year for the first and second semesters, respectively.



	31)	We recommended that Management:



a)	ensure maintenance of complete, updated and accurate Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) for each kind of inventory account and reconcile the same with that of the Property and Supply Section records; and prepare adjustment on any discrepancies noted, if warranted; and



b)	conduct inventory of Semi Expendable Equipment at the end of every semester and submit the report to the Audit Team within the prescribed period.



       Management Comment



	32)	The Bookkeeping Section shall ensure that SLCs will be properly maintained and updated. Likewise, the ongoing migration of manual process to eNGAS will greatly enhance recording, updating and maintenance of complete and accurate SLC.



	33)	The LRA-CARP conducted a nationwide physical inventory of semi-expendable equipment in 2019. Documents pertaining to said report were also provided to all Registries of Deeds (RoDs) for their appropriate action and coordination with concerned COA Representative. However, to date, only 12 percent of the 146 RoDs complied and submitted the required report.



	34)	The regular conduct of inventory and timely submission of reports from registries were hampered due to limited travel allowed because of the pandemic. Nonetheless, the office continuously coordinates through email and SMS with CARP personnel detailed in various RoDs for transmittal of reports to the Central Office.



d)	Non-preparation of RSMI for issuances of LRA-CARP totaling ₱372,496.01



	35)	Section 17.g Chapter 8, Volume 1 of the GAM provides that, RSMI (Appendix 64) shall be prepared by the Property and/or Supply Custodian based on the RIS and shall be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the JEV to record supplies and materials issued.



	36)	Audit of JEVs of LRA-CARP disclosed that the following issuances were not supported with RSMI, thus, casted doubt on the completeness and accuracy of recordings of issued supplies and materials amounting to ₱372,496.01as shown below:

	37)	We recommended that Management prepare and submit RSMI for the aforementioned issuances. Henceforth, ensure that RSMI is prepared and attached to JEVs in recording supplies and materials issued.



       Management Comment

	38)	The Supply Section regularly prepares the RSMI. However, it was only submitted on March 12, 2021.



	39)	Rest assured that LRA-CARP Management will take into consideration recommendations of the Commission on Audit and abide with the rules and regulations pertaining to matters under consideration.



e)	883 RISs for accountable forms not fully accomplished

	41)	Review of the RIS attached to JEVs revealed that out of 1,471 RIS, 883 or 60.03 percent were not fully accomplished. Most RISs lacked necessary signatures of the requesting and receiving employee, thus, casted doubt on the validity and accuracy of issuances. Impliedly, the Property and Supply Section and the Accounting Division were not strictly applying the above mentioned procedures.



	42)	According to the Property Officer the reason for lack of signatures was due to the distant locations of RoDs where accountable forms were issued. Further, RoDs are requesting accountable forms through the Physical Resource Management System, however, difficulty in returning signed RIS is encountered after accountable forms are delivered. Alternative remedies like sending through courier, sending advance scanned copy through email or making an enhancement to the system to acknowledge receipt of accountable forms must be employed by Management to ensure completeness of RIS. Lacking signatures in the RIS only shows that Management did not exercise precautionary measures in monitoring, safeguarding and accounting of said forms.



	43)	We recommended that Management adopt alternative measures and remedies to ensure completeness of RIS in the issuance of accountable forms and recording thereof and to monitor, safeguard and account the accountable forms.



       Management Comment



	44)	The Accounting Division will be in close coordination with the Property and Supply Section to monitor and ensure that RIS are properly accomplished.



Lost accountable forms (JTFs and ORs) were not immediately circularized to RoDs nationwide.



	45)	COA Circular 84 - 233 dated August 21, 1984 reiterating the provision of GAO Memorandum Circular No. 318 dated February 11, 1957 states that, effective  upon receipt of this circular, any  loss  of accountable forms in the custody of collecting and  property officers  shall immediately be reported by  the  accountable officers concerned to their respective chiefs of offices  or heads  of  government entities who, in turn, will  at  once issue a circular or notice of such loss for the  information and  guidance  of all collecting  and  disbursing  officers, provincial,   city and municipal treasurers,  bureau, provincial   and  city  auditors  and  other  concerned   in preventing  against  the  possible fraudulent  use  of  such  accountable  forms.  The notice to be issued shall specify the kind, quantity and inclusive serial numbers of the lost accountable forms and the place or places where, and approximate date or dates when, the same were lost.



	46)	Records of the Property and Supply Section revealed that the following accountable forms were lost in the hands of accountable officers (AOs).

*As of February 18, 2021



	47)	Gleaned from the above table,  the notice to RoDs nationwide to inform of losses of accountable forms was not immediately done by Management. To date, no Memorandum Circular was issued by the Head of the Agency for two instances of losses of JTFs and ORs for more than seven years. The property personnel reasoned out that delay in the issuance was attributed to the failure of the AOs to submit requirements as basis in the issuance of the circular.  Delay in the immediate reporting of loss by AOs and non-issuance of the circular may increase the risk for fraudulent use of lost accountable forms. Laxity in the dissemination of information increases probability/risk in the utilization of reported lost accountable form which may cause unreasonable damage to people affected by fraudulent transactions.



	48)	We recommended that Management:



a)	issue immediately a Memorandum Circular for the two instances of lost accountable forms; and



b)	require the concerned AO to immediately report loss of accountable forms duly supported with documentary requirements to facilitate issuance of the circular for the loss of accountable forms.

	



Management Comment

	49)	A Memorandum Circular dated February 10, 2021 was issued for the loss of 500 pieces blank JTFs issued to the Registry of Deeds of Marikina.



	50)	The loss of 14 pieces of Specialized Official Receipts (ORs) in Continuous Form (Accountable Form No. 51) issued for use in RoDs of Manila was reported to the Property and Supply Section through a letter with explanation dated February 10, 2021 and received on February 15, 2021.



	51)	Memorandum Circular for the Loss of Accountable Forms was issued upon submission of a Notice of Loss and other supporting documents. 

	

	

Doubtful PPE balances 



5)	The balance of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts totaling ₱802,356,930.69 as at year-end was doubtful due to: a) non-submission of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE); b) unrecorded acquisitions totaling ₱5,614,080.40; c) unrecorded disposals of PPE amounting to ₱7,744,824.54; thus, affecting fair presentation of the account in the financial statements;  d) non-reclassification of completed projects to the appropriate asset account; e) non-maintenance of PPE Ledger Cards for projects under construction and insufficient information in the Index of Payment to support the balance; and f) non-submission of project status as of December 31, 2020.  



a)	Non submission of RPCPPE



	1)	The GAM Volume II provides that the RPCPPE (Appendix 73) shall be used to report the physical count and condition of PPE by type as at a given date, including those which are unrecorded and those which could not be accounted for. It shows the balance of PPE per property cards and per count and the shortage/overage, if any. It shall be rendered by the Inventory Committee on its yearly physical count of properties owned by the entity.



	2)	Section 38, Chapter 10 of GAM, Volume I provides that the entity shall have a periodic physical count of PPE which shall be done annually and presented on the RPCPPE (Appendix71) as at December 31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper accounting/recording.



	3)	The Property Section informed that the preparation of RPCPPE is assigned to the Property Officer of RoDs which shall be approved by the Registrars of Deeds. Based on the list provided by the Property Section, 168 RoDs including the LRA Central Office are required to submit RPCPPE to be collated by the Property Section, LRA.



	4)	The Property Section further disclosed that they sent verbal communications and emails thru their Helpdesk instructions for the RoDs to prepare the RPCPPE. As to the list provided by the Property Section, only 102 out of the 168 RoDs submitted their RPCPPE while the remaining 66 did not submit the same. Consequently, no report has been prepared and submitted to the Audit Team contrary to Section 38 Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I.



	5)	In CY 2019, physical count was conducted nationwide by selected members of the Inventory Committee. However, the RPCPPE for CY 2019 remained unsubmitted as to date. 



	6)	We recommended that Management:

	

a)		compel the Register of Deeds (RoDs) to prepare and submit the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) for consolidation in the report of LRA Main Office by using the prescribed form pursuant to Appendix 73 of GAM Volume II;

	

b)		instruct the assigned personnel to consolidate reports submitted by RoDs and subsequently submit the RPCPPE to the Audit Team; and

	

c)		submit also the CY 2019 RPCPPE prepared by the Inventory Team.

	

       Management Comment

	7)	The Property and Supply Section will reiterate previous issued memorandum directing all Registries of Deeds to submit the RPCPPE annually.



	8)	The Property and Supply Section commits to comply with the recommendation of COA.



	9)	The CY 2019 RPCPPE was already submitted to the Office of the Auditor.



       Auditor’s Rejoinder



	10)	Upon evaluation of the 2019 RPCPPE of RoDs, it was observed that some reports lacked the certification of correctness by the Inventory Team and approval by the Head of the Agency.





b)	Unrecorded acquisitions amounting to ₱5,614,080.40 for CY 2020 



	11)	Section 12 Chapter 3 of GAM Volume I provides that a subsidiary record to monitor a particular obligation shall be maintained by the Budget Division/Unit in Section C of the ORS.  It shall contain the original amount of obligation, payable (goods delivered and services rendered) and the amount paid.



	12)	Section 44 Chapter 19 of GAM Volume I provides that errors can arise in respect of the recognition, measurement, presentation, or disclosure of elements of financial statements. Errors include the effects of mathematical mistakes, mistakes in applying accounting policies, oversights or misinterpretations of facts, and fraud. Financial statements do not comply with IPSASs if they contain either material errors, or immaterial errors made intentionally to achieve a particular presentation of an entity’s Statement of Financial Position, Statement of Financial Performance, or Statement of Cash Flows.

  

	13)	Audit of Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) covering payments of procured PPEs  totaling ₱5,614,080.40 were recorded in the books by debiting Accounts Payable instead of the appropriate PPE account. The table below summarizes the effect of the misstatement in the account balance of PPE and Accounts Payable.

	14)	The Bookkeeping Section disclosed that their current practice is to request documents from the Property Section for received and delivered PPEs to set up payables. This information was corroborated by the Property Section that  they maintained separate file for copies of Delivery Receipts (DRs)  to be given to the Bookkeeping Section upon request. However, not all DRs are  forwarded to the Bookkeeping Section; thus, DRs totaling ₱5,614,080.40 were not recorded in the books.  The Disbursement Section upon receipt of documents from the Property Section meanwhile recorded payments pertinent thereto by debiting Accounts Payable resulting in the understatement of Accounts Payable by ₱5,614,080.40, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Equipment by ₱868,080.00, and Office Equipment by ₱4,746,000.40.



	15)	The Audit Team traced the root cause of the misstatement to the absence of the complete process workflow for disbursements on procurement. The process workflow for disbursements of LRA submitted to this Office was only for the preparation of LDDAP-ADA and preparation of tax remittances for BIR, GSIS, and HDMF contributions. No procedures on how to record accruals for goods delivered and services rendered on account. The Disbursement Section recorded the payment of delivered PPE as Accounts Payable based on assumption that Accounts Payable was previously taken up in the books even without confirmation or documents to prove the existence of Accounts Payable thereby understating both the Accounts Payable and PPE accounts. Without an existing operation’s manual and process workflow which purpose is to establish procedures in recording accruals, confusion and laxity were apparent on how to approach and record deliveries before its payment.



	16)	We recommended that Management:

	

a)	formulate a process workflow on accrual of goods delivered and services rendered on account; 



b)	ensure completeness of documents and information/reference in preparing journal entries to avoid errors/ misstatements/ misrepresentations. Also, this is to avoid journalizing based on assumptions or misinterpretations of facts and not based on correct information and documents; and

	

c)	adjust/correct erroneous entries in the books of accounts for the unrecorded receipt of PPE.

	

       Management Comment

	

	17)	The Financial Service has already formulated a process workflow on accrual of goods and services rendered on account.



	18)	The Bookkeeping Section will see to it that all journal entries made are based on documents and information that are complete and proper.



	19)	The unrecorded acquisitions totaling ₱5,614,080.40 were recorded/adjusted under JEV No. 03-2021-03-09(BS).









c)	Unrecorded disposals of PPE amounting to ₱7,744,824.54 



	20)	Section 39 Chapter 10 of GAM, Volume I provides that in the derecognition of PPE, the cost of PPE together with the related accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss shall be removed from the accounts (2014 edition Financial Accounting, Volume I, Valix). The carrying amount of an item of PPE shall be derecognized on disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential is expected from its use or disposal. The following are the policies on the disposal of PPE, among others:

	

a)	A JEV shall be prepared by the Accounting Division/Unit to derecognize the asset from the books of accounts only after its disposal; and



b)	Disposal procedures of unserviceable property shall be in accordance with applicable rules and regulations on Supply and Property Management Manual, and Section 79 of PD 1445.



	21)	The following RoDs conducted disposal of PPE in CY 2020 based on the list provided by the Property Section. Examination of the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) showed the following PPEs included in the disposal:

Total 

₱  7,744,824.54

*capitalization threshold of P15,000 was applied in the IIRUP for inclusion in the list





	22)	Upon inquiry, the Property Section disclosed that the required documents such as IIRUP, office orders, and invoice receipt of property to support the disposals are not yet forwarded to the Bookkeeping Section. These documents would be the basis of the Bookkeeping Section in recording the disposal. Analysis of accounting records also showed that no derecognition of disposed PPE is recorded in the books. 



	23)	The non-submission of documents to the Bookkeeping Section as confirmed by the Property Section resulted in the unrecorded disposal and derecognition of assets in the books of accounts which rendered the PPE account balance overstated by ₱7,744,824.54. The Accumulated Depreciation account was also overstated for the depreciated amount of the PPE as well as the Accumulated Surplus account for the amount equal to the residual values of the disposed PPE.



	24)	We recommended that Management:

	

a)	direct the Property and Supply Section to submit to the Accounting Division necessary documents showing the manner of disposal whether by donation, sale, destruction as the case may be, date of transfer, transfer JEV, if transferred to another government agency, acceptance report signed by responsible official of recipient government agency among others, of the disposed properties; and 



b)	make appropriate entries to derecognize properties disposed of from the books of accounts. 

	

       Management Comment

	

	25)	Accounting Division will send a letter to Property and Supply Section requesting submission of  documents pertinent to the disposal.



	26)	The Bookkeeping Section will take up the adjustment in the books of accounts upon receipt of pertinent documents from the Property and Supply Section.



Non-implementation of one-time cleansing of PPE Account Balances 



	27)	COA Circular No. 2020-006 dated January 31, 2020 provide the  guidelines and procedures in the conduct of physical count of PPE, recognition of PPE items found at station and disposition for non-existing/missing PPE Items for the One-time cleansing of PPE account balances of government agencies.



	28)	Observations and recommendations regarding existence of enormous amounts of discrepancies in the PPE account of the Agency were embodied in prior years audit reports. However, the unreconciled balances between the physical count and book balance remained to be material.



	29)	The PPE accounts monitoring schedule submitted to COA as of semester ending December 31, 2020 showed that there were 17 accounts for reconciliation totaling ₱736,300,686.64 for LRA and five accounts for LRA-CARP totaling ₱58,158,821.45 as of March 31, 2020 based on the available book balance when the report was submitted.



	30)	Considering the materiality of the amount involved, the absence of details affected reliability of PPE accounts as presented in the financial statements at year end. The continued non-maintenance of PPELCs by the Accounting Division as well as the absence of a detailed schedule or breakdown to support the GL balances of PPE accounts contributed to the difficulty in determining discrepancies.



	31)	The guidelines also included updating of PPELCs and Property Cards. Accountability of PPE should be verified by the Inventory Committee while procedures are also laid down in the derecognition of non-existing/missing PPE without available record of accountability.

           

	32)	We recommended that Management implement the procedures  prescribed in COA Circular 2020-006 for the one-time cleansing of PPE account.



       Management Comment



	33)	The Accounting Division and Property and Supply Section will consider the recommendation of COA.



	34)	Full implementation of LRA-CARP of the one-time cleansing of PPE was significantly affected by the localized lockdown implemented nationwide during Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) and Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine (MECQ). 



d)	Non reclassification of completed projects to the appropriate asset account 



	35)	Section 8(g), Chapter 10 of the GAM Vol. I states that, x x x As soon as the construction is completed, the “Construction in Progress” account shall be reclassified to the proper asset account. Likewise, all expenses such as interests, license fees, etc., during the construction period shall be capitalized.



	36)	Section 27(c) of the same chapter provides that, depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by Management.



	37)	As of December 31, 2020, the Construction in Progress – Building and Other Structures account of the LRA showed a total balance of ₱23,901,382.13, as shown below.

*Per validation of the Audit Team

	40)	However, the Accounting Division  reasoned out that they were not furnished with copy of the Certificate of Completion and Acceptance as basis in the  transfer of completed projects to the appropriate Asset account except for Rehabilitation of Sprinkler System of LRA-CO wherein the Certificate of Completion was already issued.  However, there is no indication that Rehabilitation of Sprinkler System was accepted by the agency despite full payment to RB Soriano Construction and release of retention fee and submission of Surety Bond in lieu of the retention fee. It was noted that Management did not submit updates on the reason for non-acceptance of the project and on whether claims had been made by LRA to RB Soriano Construction or to the Surety for any defects, if any.



	41)	As regards the other projects with Certificate of Completion/Acceptance, one of the members of the Secretariat of BAC-Infrastructure admitted to have falsely claimed and reported the issuance of required Certificate as per validation of the Audit Team.



	42)	In effect, the Construction in Progress account was overstated while the Building account was understated both by ₱22,321,249.99. Consequently, the corresponding depreciation of assets was also not recognized contrary to Section 27(c) of the same chapter even if such assets were already subjected to use by Management after their completion a long time ago.  This resulted in understatement of corresponding Depreciation Expense and Accumulated Depreciation.  However, the amount of understatement could not be determined due to insufficiency of data such as actual completion date and useful life which were not provided by the BAC-Infrastructure Secretariat.



	43)	Moreover, it was also observed that Variation Order # 2 amounting to ₱89,155.00 for project in Ozamis City has already been recognized in the Building account as disclosed in the Notes to Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020.  Strangely, the amount of ₱4,214,833.80 for the Construction of RoD Ozamis was still under the Construction in Progress  account.



	44)	We recommended that Management:



	a)	require the BAC-infrastructure projects to submit to the Accounting Division the Certificate of Completion and Acceptance issued to facilitate transfer of completed projects to the Building account;



	b)	justify recording of ₱89,155.00 representing Variation Order for the construction of RoD Ozamis building to the Building account despite non- reclassification of the project with 96.82 percent completion under the Construction in Progress account of ₱4,214,833.80;

	

	c)	submit to the Audit Team  the Certificate of Acceptance issued in favor of RB Soriano Construction on the  Rehabilitation of Sprinkler System of LRA-Central Office; and



	d)	effect proper adjustments in the books for the reclassification of completed projects to the appropriate PPE account.



Management Comment

	

	45)	The Accounting Division will reiterate its previous request for BAC to submit the Certificate of Completion and Acceptance.



	46)	The Bookkeeping Section will look into its records and find out why the said amount was recorded to the Building account. Accordingly, necessary explanation will be provided as soon as the reason for recording is determined.



	47)	The recommendation to submit the Certificate of Acceptance will be complied with.



	48)	The necessary adjustment to reclassify completed projects will be made. The JEV will be immediately submitted once prepared.

	

e)	Lack of PPELC for Construction in Progress account and Index of Payment and/or sufficient information in the Index of Payment (IP) to support the balance 



	49)	In depth analysis and verification of accuracy and completeness of the amount could not be made due to lack of PPELC for Construction in Progress account and Index of Payment and/or information in the  latter  to support the balance as of December 31, 2020. Request was made by the Audit Team to submit the PPELC for Construction in Progress account and project cost sheets, however, the only document submitted to this Office pertains to the list of balances of projects included under the account. The Accounting Division admitted that they do not have PPELC for Construction in Progress account. There was difficulty in the analysis of the account due to non-maintenance of PPELCs and/or Index of Payments as required in the Instructions, Appendices 77 and 38 contained in Volume II of the GAM.  Noteworthy, at the time of the implementation of projects, the existing reference on the same requirement was the Manual on the New Government Accounting System (MNGAS). Based on Section 4, Chapter 2 Volume 1 of MNGAS, SL for Construction in Progress account must be maintained as part of Regular Agency (RA) books. In addition, Section 111 of PD No. 1445 states that the accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.  



	50)	We also requested for copy of Index of Payment pertaining to those contractors, however, even the Index of Payment of the contractors was incomplete and the reference numbers were not indicated such as check/LDDAP No. and DV Nos. to easily locate the source documents.



	51)	We recommended that Management reconstruct pertinent records and provide the lacking information needed in the Index of Payment; assign Accounting Staff who will handle and maintain PPELC for Construction in Progress account and Index of Payment in the format prescribed in the GAM.



       Management Comment



	52)	The Accounting Division is in the process of migrating from its manual process to eNGAS. Accordingly, they believe that this will cure the issues such as lack of PPELC and insufficient information in the Index of Payment. Further, the Disbursement Section will see to it that necessary information are properly indicated in the Index of Payment.

f)	Non-submission of project status as of December 31, 2020

	53)	In addition, status report of projects as of December 31, 2020 was not submitted to the Audit Team. In a communication dated November 27, 2019 furnished to this Office as attachment to AAPSI submitted on December 23, 2019, it was stated that defaulting contractors were endorsed to the Legal Service for proper disposition. However, as to date, no document containing information on the appropriate action taken by Management on said issues has been submitted to this Office.  Considering that contracts were executed between 1996 and 2014, delays may have been incurred and appropriate charges should have been filed by LRA Management for non-compliance with the terms of the contract, if there is any.



	54)	We recommended that Management provide status reports on the legal action taken against and demand letters issued to defaulting contractors, if any.



       Management Comment



	55)	BAC-Infra will check its records and provide status report regarding the demand letters issued to contractors, if any.



Doubtful Current Liabilities



6)	The accuracy and completeness of the year-end balance of Current Liabilities accounts totaling ₱116,220,779.51 are doubtful due to: a) erroneous recording of 27 transactions due to lack of coordination between Sections in the Accounting Division and lack of necessary information/ reference/documents; b) unrecorded due and demandable obligations amounting to ₱21,740,051.24; c) misclassification of account amounting to ₱8,956,354.00. d) erroneous adjustment of cancelled checks amounting to ₱1,750,838.49; e) unadjusted/unreconciled discrepancies of ₱1,445,245.53 between the amount withheld and remittances to HDMF per month and deficient balances in previous years; and f) double recording of obligations totaling ₱47,982,080.25; thus, adversely affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements.



	1)	The Current Liabilities accounts have an aggregate balance of ₱116,220,779.51 consisting of the following:

	3)	Section 2a, Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume I defined Accounts Payable as valid and legal obligations of NGAs/OUs, for which, goods/services/projects have been delivered/rendered/completed and accepted, regardless of the year when these obligations were incurred.



	4)	The schedule of Accounts Payable provided by the Bookkeeping Section includes several transactions already paid and negative balances as a result of payment of liabilities without the corresponding set up of payables in the books of accounts.

	6)	According to Management, miscommunication between Bookkeeping Section and Disbursement Section resulted in erroneous recording of payments.



	7)	The following errors contributed to the misstatements of Accounts Payable:



	a)	Double recording of transactions in the books of accounts pertaining to CY 2019 and another one in CY 2020 totaling ₱711,928.15 resulted in the overstatement of Accounts Payable and the understatement of Accumulated Surplus. 



	b)	Accruals for CY 2020 were made to recognize the wages of job order workers at the LRA Central Office and various Registries of Deeds aggregating ₱3,205,141.16 for the month of December 2020. Verification of December 2020 bank statement of LRA’s Cash in Bank –Local Currency Current Account showed that the aforementioned amount was already paid but no entry was made to record reconciling items, thereby overstating the Cash-in-Bank, LCCA and Accounts Payable accounts both by ₱3,205,141.16.  (Detailed discussion in Observation No. 1 on Cash);



	c)	Difference of ₱318,015.71 between the liability set-up for janitorial and security services in CY 2019 and amount paid in CY 2020 due to re-computation for such expenses by the Disbursement Section. Upon payment, no adjustment pertaining to the difference has been made which resulted in the overstatement of Accounts Payable and the understatement of Accumulated Surplus both by ₱318,015.71;



	d)	Delivery of thermoguns from PS-DBM was recorded twice. The erroneous recording resulted in the overstatement of Office Supplies Inventory and Accounts Payable both by ₱521,560.00 (Detailed discussion in Observation No. 4 for Inventory);



	e)	Error in recording payment of procured PPE amounting to ₱5,614,080.40. Disbursement Section debited Accounts Payable and credited Cash MDS even if no liability was set-up and no supporting documents were attached thereto; thus, understating the Accounts Payable and PPE accounts. (Detailed discussion in Observation No. 5 for PPE);



	f)	Error in recording payment of several expenses totaling ₱1,362,972.06. Disbursement Section debited Accounts Payable and credited Cash MDS even if no liability was set-up and no supporting documents were attached thereto; thus, understating Accounts Payable and overstating Accumulated Surplus as expense accounts are already closed at year end.



	g)	Erroneous recording of reissuance of check amounting to ₱22,654.50 in favor of the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) as replacement of cancelled check where Accounts Payable was debited instead of Due to NGAs. The initial check issued was recorded as debit to Other Prepayments, however, audit revealed that the check was cancelled and the amount was reverted to the Cash account. Due to NGAs was set-up for the amount payable to BTr. This  resulted in the understatement of Accounts Payable and the overstatement of Due to NGAs.



	8)	We recommended that Management:



	a)		make necessary adjustments/reclassification of affected accounts to correct the balance in the financial statements; 

	

	b)		formulate a process workflow to improve coordination/ communication between Bookkeeping Section and Disbursement Section under the Accounting Division; and



	c)		require the Accounting Division to ensure  completeness of necessary information and documentary requirements before processing of claims to avoid commission of erroneous entries.









Management Comment



	9)	The adjustment/reclassification of the affected accounts will be made and the JEV will be submitted immediately to the Office of the Auditor.



	10)	The Bookkeeping and Disbursement Section will closely coordinate with each other in order to avoid errors in recording transactions.



	11)	The JEV taking up the Payable Account will be attached to the DV which will be the basis of the Disbursement Section to prepare accounting entries and as proof that transaction was already recognized/set up as Payable in the book of accounts.



b)	Unrecorded Due and Demandable Obligations amounting to ₱21,740,051.24 



	12)	Every year, Management is required to submit Financial Accountability Reports (FAR) to various concerned Agencies. One of the required reports to be submitted to COA is FAR no. 3 - Aging of Unpaid Obligations.



	13)	FAR no. 3 – Aging of Unpaid Obligations includes Due and Demandable Obligations which are to be recorded as Accounts Payable at year-end and Not Yet Due and Demandable Obligations. However, submitted FAR no. 3 did not reconcile with details of FAR no.1 or the Statement of Appropriations, Allotment, Obligations, Disbursements, and Balances (SAAODB) particularly the due and demandable and not yet due and demandable obligations. This observation was brought to the attention of the Budget Section. To facilitate the audit of liabilities while awaiting submission of revised FAR, the Audit Team requested the Budget Section to submit copies of ORS forms considered as due and demandable obligations as of December 31, 2020.



	14)	The submitted ORS showed that there were 442 due and demandable obligations for goods delivered and services rendered as at year-end from different suppliers and utilities from both LRA CO and Registries of Deeds (RoDs). These, however, were compared with the Schedule of Accounts Payable prepared by the Bookkeeping Section to determine whether these obligations were recorded in the books of accounts at year end or the ORS were already paid. Comparison revealed that 213 obligations totaling ₱20,490,219.76 were not recorded as Accounts Payable.  These obligations were for janitorial and security services and utilities expense of the RoDs, thereby understating the Accounts Payable and Accumulated Surplus accounts.



	15)	Also, it has been the practice of the RoDs to pay the utilities expenses (electric and water consumption) to avoid late payment which were subsequently reimbursed at the LRA Central Office. There were 222 due and demandable obligations for reimbursement to various LRA personnel included in the submitted ORS. Verification with Management and the books of accounts disclosed that these obligations amounting to ₱1,249,831.48 were indeed unrecorded in the books of accounts as Due to Officers and Employees and Accumulated Surplus.



	16)	According to Management, notwithstanding the communications made between Bookkeeping Section and the Budget Section for the preparation of FAR no. 3, personnel assigned to prepare FAR no. 3 was not able to accomplish the report on time. As alleged by the Budget Section, they are still conducting reconciliation to verify correctness of obligations incurred, adding to the fact that they are not familiar with the report as it was just recently assigned and turned over to them. As a result, recorded liabilities were incomplete. The non-recording of due and demandable obligations significantly affected completeness of Current Liabilities accounts reported in the financial statements by ₱21,740,051.24.



	17)	We recommended that Management:



a)	 make appropriate and necessary adjusting entries in the books and ensure that all due and demandable obligations with valid claims are recorded in the books of accounts;



b)	 require proper coordination between Budget Section and Bookkeeping Section to ensure that reports like Financial Accountability Reports (FAR) No. 3 are accomplished on time; and 



c)	 submit the duly accomplished FARs to the Audit Team. 

	

       Management Comment



	18)	Adjusting entries were already taken up in the book of accounts under JEV Nos. 01-2021-01-12(BS) and 03-2021-01-14(BS).



	19)	The Budget Section and Bookkeeping Section will closely coordinate with each other to ensure that reports are properly accomplished on time.



c)	Misclassification of Due to NGAs to Due to GOCCs amounting to ₱8,956,354.00



	20)	Shown below is the breakdown of Due to GOCCs as of December 31, 2020:



Payee

Amount

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) 

₱         4,875,000.00

National Printing Office (NPO) 

8,956,354.00

Philippine Postal Corporation (PPC)

2,042,427.25

Total 

   ₱       15,873,781.25



	21)	Contrary to the above details, the Notes to Financial Statements disclosed that the amount of Due to GOCCs represents payable to BSP amounting to ₱13,831,354.00, and PPC amounting to ₱2,042,427.25 or a total of ₱15,873,781.25; thus, rendering the Due to GOCCs account balance  unreliable due to inconsistency between the breakdown of the subject account and the disclosure in the Notes to Financial Statements as regards to the amount due to NPO and BSP.



	22)	Audit of JEV No. 2020-12-141(BS) dated December 31, 2020 revealed that the amount payable to NPO pertains to the delivery of ORs. It was recorded in the books by debiting Accountable Forms, Supplies  Inventory and crediting Due to GOCCs. The description of the entry stated that it was payable to BSP though the attachments such as DRs and Purchase Order (PO) indicated that the supplier was NPO.



	23)	Noteworthy, NPO is a National Government Agency and not a GOCC by virtue of EO No. 285 Series of 1987 creating NPO and to date it is under the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO), therefore the amount due to NPO is supposedly recorded under the Due to NGAs account. The misclassification of account resulted in the understatement of Due to NGAs and the overstatement of Due to GOCCs by ₱8,956,354.00.



	24)	We recommended that Management make necessary reconciliation before making adjustments/reclassification of accounts. Likewise, direct the Chief Accountant and the Bookkeeping Officer to observe diligence in recording transactions and disclosing information in the Notes to Financial Statements.



       Management Comment



	25)	The adjustment/reclassification was taken up under JEV No. 03-2021-01-016(BS).



d)	Cancellation of checks were erroneously adjusted; thus, overstating the Due to Pag-IBIG account amounting to ₱1,750,838.49 and Subsidy from NG by the same amount



	26)	Analysis of Due to Pag-IBIG account disclosed that 22 checks payable to HDMF were cancelled during the year. Cancellations were attributed to the non-acceptance of checks for reason that some employees have no Membership Identification (MID) number by virtue of the migration of HDMF into a new system that requires Pag-IBIG MID number.



	27)	Out of the 22 cancelled checks, three were erroneously adjusted due to its cancellation. Upon verification, no payments were recorded.  Accordingly, no adjustment was required.  However, the cancellation of the checks was recorded under JEV No. 01-2020-08-094 dated August 31, 2020 as follows:

	28)	Based on the above, since the amount of these checks were added to Cash - MDS, Regular account and no disbursements were made at the end of the quarter, the amount was closed to the Subsidy from National Government account and considered lapsed at the end of the quarter. The erroneous entries made resulted in the overstatement of Due to Pag-IBIG by ₱1,750,838.49 and the understatement of Subsidy from National Government by the same amount.



	29)	We recommended that Management adjust the erroneous entries made in the books of accounts by debiting Due to Pag-IBIG and crediting Accumulated Surplus accounts both amounting to  ₱1,750,838.49.



       Management Comment



	30)	The adjustment was already taken up under JEV No. 01-2021-01-015.



e)	Unadjusted/unreconciled discrepancies of ₱1,445,245.53 between the amount withheld and remittances per month and deficient balances in previous years



	31)	Comparison between the amount withheld from officers and employees and the monthly remittances for CY 2020 showed discrepancies aggregating ₱563,495.40 as shown below.

	32)	Gleaned from the table above, it disclosed that the monthly amount withheld from officers and employees were greater than the amount remitted.  The table also showed the nature of transactions where the difference of ₱563,495.40 could be attributed which pertained to unadjusted contributions, calamity loan, housing loan and MP2.

	34)	From the computation above, we arrived at the amount of unadjusted/unreconciled amount for the current and previous years balances.



	35)	We recommended that Management prepare necessary adjustment on the noted variance between the amount withheld and amount remitted during the year, if warranted and continue reconciliation of deficient balances in previous years.



       Management Comment



	36)	The Disbursement Section, Accounting Division will validate the amount involved and conduct reconciliation to verify noted discrepancies. After which, necessary adjustments will be effected.



f)	Double Recording of Obligation



The double recording of obligations totaling ₱47,982,080.25 resulted in the overstatement of various Personnel Services (PS) and Liability accounts.



	37)	We focused on the unpaid obligation at year end due to the materiality of the amount involved; thus, we verified JEV No. 01-202012-148 (BS) dated December 31, 2020 totaling ₱54,394,024.94.

	43)	Inquiry with Management revealed that erroneous entries were made as a result of non-validation by the Accounting Division of the list of obligations submitted by the Budget Division. The Budget Division, on the other hand admitted that they committed errors in the list due to lapses of personnel who prepared the list.



	44)	In addition, verification cannot be made to the remaining ORS totaling ₱6,411,944.69 included in the adjustment of unpaid obligations of ₱54,394,024.94 on December 31, 2020 due to incomplete documentations, casting doubts on the validity of the obligations. The list of ORS was the only document attached to the JEV in recording of unpaid obligations. Details as to the nature of transaction, payee and the amount involved per payee were not indicated or could not be determined. Request was made to the Accounting Division to submit supporting documents/information to support claims such as JEV Nos. of paid payrolls, supporting documents for terminal leave and other personnel benefits to validate transactions, however, as to date, no documents are provided to the Audit Team. 



	45)	We recommended that Management:



a)	 prepare adjustment on erroneous entries made in the books of accounts; 



b)	 submit supporting documents showing details of obligations taken- up as of December 31, 2020; and



c)	 ensure that all transactions are recorded in the books duly supported with JEV and other documents to facilitate reconciliation of accounts in case of discrepancy.



       Management Comment



	46)	The adjustment will be made and the corresponding JEV will be immediately submitted to COA. The Accounting Division commits to comply with the recommendation of the good auditors.



	47)	The Bookkeeping Section commits to ensure that unpaid obligations are properly supported before recording it in the books of accounts.



Unaccounted Service Concession Assets and Liabilities



7)	The service concession assets and liabilities pertaining to the implementation of Land Titling Computerization Project (LTCP) under the Build-Own-Operate (BOO) Agreement with Land Registration Systems, Inc. (LARES, Inc.) were not recognized in the books of LRA; thus, misstating the affected accounts by undetermined amount contrary to International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 32 – Service Concession Arrangement - and Sections 2(d) and 3(a), Chapter 14 of the GAM, Volume I. Moreover, projects already completed by LARES were not adjusted to the Service Concession Assets and pertinent documentary requirements were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor for proper evaluation.  

	1)	Sections 2(d) and 3(a), Chapter 14 of the GAM, Volume I provides that, Service Concession Arrangement is a binding arrangement between a grantor and an operator in which the operator uses the service concession asset to provide a public service on behalf of the grantor for a specified period of time; and is compensated for its services over the period of the service concession arrangement.  Further, the grantor shall recognize an asset provided by the operator and an upgrade to an existing asset of the grantor as a service concession asset if: the grantor controls or regulates what services the operator must provide with the asset, to whom it must provide them, and at what price; and controls – through ownership, beneficial entitlement or otherwise – any significant residual interest in the asset at the end of the term of the arrangement. (Par. 9, PPSAS 32)



	2)	Due to non-compliance by the agency on previous year’s audit recommendations, we reiterated/updated the same for its implementation.



	3)	Based on the Certificate of Acceptance of IT Facilities (CAIFs) issued to LARES, Inc., the Project Proponent has already completed four of the five phases of the Land Titling Computerization Project (LTCP). However,  Service Concession Asset is still not recognized in the books of undetermined amount contrary to the above provision.  IPSAS 32 openly implies the transfer of assets from the project proponent to the grantor notwithstanding the provision of 6.03 of the BOO Agreement which states that ownership over the assets shall be transferred to the grantor at the end of the entire concession period.



	4)	Moreover, no disclosure was made in the Notes to Financial Statements as regards the service concession arrangement with LARES, Inc. as required by the following provisions in IPSAS 32.



                   Presentation and Disclosure (see paragraphs AG65–AG67)

31. The grantor shall present information in accordance with IPSAS I



32. All aspects of a service concession arrangement shall be considered        in determining the appropriate disclosures in the notes. A grantor shall disclose the following information in respect of service concession arrangements in each reporting period: (a) A description of the arrangement; (b) Significant terms of the arrangement that may affect the amount, timing, and certainty of future cash flows (e.g., the period of concession, re-pricing dates, and the basis upon which re-pricing or re-negotiation is determined); (c) The nature and extent (e.g., quantity, time period, or amount, as appropriate) of: (i) Rights to use specified assets; (ii) Rights to expect the operator to provide specified services in relation to the service concession arrangement; (iii) Service concession assets recognized as assets during the reporting period, including existing assets of the grantor reclassified as service concession assets; (iv) Rights to receive specified assets at the end of the service concession arrangement; (v) Renewal and termination options; (vi) Other rights and obligations (e.g., major overhaul of service concession assets); and (vii) Obligations to provide the operator with access to service concession assets or other revenue-generating assets; and (d) Changes in the arrangement occurring during the reporting period.



	5)	The non-recording of these assets in the books of LRA significantly misstated the Assets, Liabilities, and Equity accounts by undetermined amount. Based on the LARES’ Notes to Financial Statements as of March 28, 2018, the combined cost of intangible assets of LARES, Inc. as regards the LTCP was ₱13,411,988,585.00. This amount represents cost incurred by LARES, Inc. pertaining to the LTCP under the BOO Agreement with the LRA plus a certain profit margin. For emphasis, that amount was only as of March 31, 2018.  We are now in 2020, roughly two years and nine months, and it already marked a difference of ₱9.929 billion compared to the project cost estimate of ₱3.483 billion as per Memorandum dated August 20, 1998 of the Investment Coordination Committee – Technical Board (ICC-TB) of NEDA. 



	6)	Noticeably, the Notice to Resume (NTR) the work and proceed to mobilize all project committees and resume finalization of all design and acceptance documents, guidelines and plans necessary for the implementation of the LTCP was dated August 28, 2007.  This was due to the Arbitration between the contracting parties caused by the delay of LARES, Inc. in the implementation of the project.  After which, the Notice to Proceed (NTP) was issued by LRA to LARES on February 29, 2008 signifying the latter to proceed with the mobilization and implementation of the LTCP. As provided in Article 8 of the BOO Agreement setting the project implementation timeline by phase, the final concession period would end on the 13th year based on the Compromise Agreement or on July 29, 2021.  Notably, Section 1.11 of the BOO Agreement also states that each phase of the project shall have a concession period of 10 years from issuance of Certificate of Acceptance of an IT Facility (CAIF) on each phase, subject to extension within three years prior to expiration of each concession period as may be authorized by law and concerned authorities.  In the absence of document/s showing any approved extension/s of the concession period, July 29, 2021 is the final concession period. 



	7)	Section 3.c.1 Chapter 14 of the GAM, Volume I, provides that the grantor shall initially measure the service concession asset at FV, if the service concession assets is provided by the operator. Further verification could not be made to date as the Project Proponent is yet to submit documents containing the details pertaining to the assets provided to the agency by virtue of the BOO Agreement as disclosed in the joint meeting among LRA Management, representatives of LARES, Inc. (Service Provider) and the Audit Team. 



	8)	Likewise, the non-disclosure of service concession arrangement in the Notes to Financial Statements prevented the users/stakeholders of relevant information which affected the faithful representations and reliability of its financial statements. 



Non-recognition of Service Concession Assets for works accomplished by LARES and pertinent documentary requirements were not submitted for proper evaluation

	9)	The project for the construction of RoD Bldg. Butuan/Agusan Del Norte was not completed by Twine Construction Service due to Management’s decision to unilaterally terminate the contract and was completed by LARES, Inc.



	10)	The construction of the RoD in Batac, Ilocos Norte were originally included in the submitted Request for Proposal (RFP) by LARES, Inc. on the LTCP.  As the Municipality of Batac administered the construction, LARES has done renovation only instead of the construction. Some completion works has also been done by LARES in RoD Ozamis City.



	11)	The abovementioned works of LARES, Inc. for LTCP were not included in the original proposal, however, Management did not submit documents for any additional works or approved Change Order as well as detailed plan and estimates. The documents are needed for proper evaluation of cost and determination of the amount for recognition of Service Concession Assets of the agency



	12)	The construction of the RoD in Batac, Ilocos Norte were originally included in the submitted Request for Proposal by LARES, Inc. on the LTCP.  As the Municipality of Batac administered the construction, LARES has done renovation only instead of construction. Some completion works have also been done by LARES in RoD Ozamis City.



	13)	We recommended that Management:



a)	instruct the Director, Finance Service and the Chief Accountant to account and record in the books the total value of constructed buildings and improvements and other deliverables by virtue of  Certificate of Acceptance of IT Facilities (CAIFs), and provide appropriate disclosures in the Notes to Financial Statements in compliance with IPSAS 32 and Sections 2(d) and 3(a), Chapter 14, GAM, Volume I.

b)	submit pertinent documentary requirements on the construction, repair and improvement of RoD Offices located in Ozamis City, Butuan/Agusan del Norte and Batac, Ilocos Norte which LARES took over including variations to the original proposals for the conduct of technical review.



       Management Comment



	14)	The service concession assets will be recorded once the list of constructed buildings and improvements is transmitted to and received by the Accounting Division.



	15)	The recommendation is being discussed with concerned officials. Rest assured that documentary requirements will be provided as soon it becomes available.





COMPLIANCE AUDIT



The following observations were noted in the audit of “Compliance of LRA to the provisions of the MOA between the LRA and banks relative to the agency’s extension office project”, the focused area of the audit team for compliance audit for CY 2020.



Non-compliance with MOAs - LRA Extension Office Project



8)	The Government lost approximately ₱1,369,092.17 for the period January to September 2020 due to non- implementation of certain provisions in the Memoranda of Agreement between the LRA and the contracting parties on the operation of LRA Extension Office. 



	1)	Paragraphs 4.c, d, and e of the MOA provide that:



a)	The contracting party shall pay an operating and maintenance fee, on a per certified true copy basis totaling ₱82.00, as follows:



		i)	Thirty pesos (₱30.00) payable to LRA and;

		ii)	Fifty-two pesos (₱52.00) subject to vat, payable to LARES.



a)	In addition, contracting parties shall pay LRA an annual subscription fee in the amount of ₱120,000.00.



b)	The applicable fees provided in items c and d above shall automatically be adjusted annually by considering changes in the nationwide consumer price index (CPI) (2006 = 100) as published by the National Statistics Office (NSO).



The annual price adjustment shall be computed by LRA and submitted to the contracting party before November 30 of the same year, for implementation on January 1 of the following year:



The rate for the price adjustment shall be equivalent to:

i)		Five percent (5%); or

	

ii)		The percentage increase between (a) the current CPI, which is the available CPI at the time of the price adjustment computation, and (b) base CPI which is either (b1) the CPI in the month LRA extension office commenced operations, in case of first adjustment or (b2) the CPI used as “current CPI” for computing the most recent adjustment, whichever is higher.



The Adjusted fee shall be computed as follows:

Adjusted fee = Previous fee x [100% + (rate for the price adjustment)]



	2)	LRA and the contracting party entered into a MOA from February 2012 to November 2018 to set-up, operate and maintain LRA Extension Office in the premises of the contracting party  to receive, process and issue LRA-approved CTCs of Certificates of Title using A2A capability of the computerized LRA System.

	4)	One of the obligations of contracting party is to pay an operating and maintenance fee to LRA and LARES on a per certified true copy basis as stated in paragraph no. 4.c in MOA where the contracting party shall pay ₱30.00 and ₱52.00 to LRA and LARES, respectively. An annual subscription fee of ₱120,000.00 shall also be paid to LRA.



	5)	Paragraph 4.e meanwhile requires LRA to compute for an annual price adjustment and to submit it to contracting party before November 15 of each year for its review, which shall be completed by the latter on November 30 of the same year for implementation on January 1 of the following year.



	6)	However, examination of SOAs billed to banks, some government agencies, and private entities for payment of services rendered by LRA and LARES,  SOAs for annual subscription fees and ORs evidencing payment thereof, disclosed that the amount of operating and maintenance fee’s charged by LRA  remained at ₱30 and ₱120,000.00, respectively, since implementation of agreement. In addition, inquiry with Management revealed that no review of annual price adjustment was conducted and communicated to concerned parties. 



	7)	To determine the adjusted rates in CY 2020 for LRA Fees, a computation was made  using the formula stated in paragraph 4.e of the MOA. 



	8)	A total of 70,264 transactions from January to September 2020 were processed in the operation of LRA Extension Office within the premises of the contracting parties. With the said number of transactions, a total  possible loss of ₱1,369,092.17 (Annex B) was computed consisting of ₱697,916.89 in operating and maintenance fee and ₱671,175.28 in annual subscription fee. The annual price adjustment shall be computed by the LRA and submitted to the contracting parties for review which in our evaluation has not been performed by the former since 2012 or when the operation of LRA Extension Office has started. The rates were not adjusted in accordance with Paragraph 4.e. of the MOA.



	9)	As regards the adjustment on the operating and maintenance fees for LARES, it should be emphasized that any adjustment for any fees being charged by LARES are subject to the approval by the Investment Coordination Committee – National Economic and Development Authority (ICC-NEDA) pursuant to  Section 12.11 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 6957 as amended by RA No. 7718 which mentioned that the increase in agreed fees on the original contract shall be considered as a contract variation and shall undergo approval of the above mentioned body.



	10)	The neglect by LRA to implement the provisions in the MOA precluded the government thru the LRA to collect additional fees of approximately ₱1,369,092.17 for the period January to September 2020 alone based on available data. We also noted the lack of assigned/responsible office or dedicated personnel to handle and monitor the implementation of the provisions of the MOAs. These rate adjustments would have generated more revenue to the government to help fund its existing and future projects.



	11)	We recommended that Management:



a)	revisit paragraphs 4.c, d, and e of the MOAs and implement the annual price adjustment review;



b)	assign an Office to handle and monitor provisions of MOAs that require review and action by the LRA; and 



c)	compute necessary adjustments on the operating and maintenance fees as well as annual subscription fees based on formula stated in MOAs and implement the same.



       Management Comment



	12)	LRA Management has already prepared letters addressed to different entities with LRA EOs relative to implementation of the annual price adjustment and that any unsettled obligation will be billed and collected.



	13)	With regard to the increase in operating and maintenance fee, the imposition of ₱30.00 was based on the revised rate provided in LRA Circular No. 11-2002 and authorized under Section 116.9 of PD No. 1529. However, after careful re-examination of laws covering the same, accordingly they might not be able to increase the fee as this requires approval of other government offices like DOF.



	14)	Management will take into consideration the recommendations to revisit the MOA and effect necessary revisions, if there is any.



	15)	The Revenue Section, Accounting Division will handle and monitor provisions of the MOA that requires review and action from LRA particularly collection and adjustment of fees.



	16)	LRA Management commits to implement the recommendation of COA. As of this writing, the Revenue Section has started preparing details of fee adjustments after which it will send to the different LRA EO together with SOA.





Uncollected LRA Fees and unidentified period covered of amounts collected



9)	Laxity in the implementation of Paragraphs 5.a and b of the Memorandum of Agreement for the LRA Extension Office Project resulted in various deficiencies such as: a) uncollected LRA Fees amounting to ₱5,910,386.00 for the period January to October 2020; b) absence of Order of Payment and details of amount paid for collections amounting to ₱3,084,250.00; and c) lack of information on summary of previous balance, current charges, and payment received in the Statement of Account issued by LRA. Further, payment of securities totaling ₱12,000,000.00 was not deposited to the LRA Trust account; thereby, exposing the LRA to the risk of loss of revenues in case of non-settlement of outstanding obligations by contracting parties/entities with LRA Extension Office.  



	1)	The MOA provided the procedure in the payment and settlement of accounts where the contracting parties -banks depending on the agreement with LRA pay the applicable fee thru weekly, bi-monthly, or monthly arrangement.



Paragraph 5.a of MOAs provides that, the LRA shall send a Statement of Account (SOA), which shall include a summary of received transactions received by the Extension Office for the period.



Paragraph 5.b of the MOAs also provides that Statements of accounts shall be settled by clients within five (5) business days from receipt.



a)	LRA Fees amounting to ₱5,910,386.00 for the period covering January 2020 to October 2020 remained uncollected



	2)	Verification of submitted SOAs of contracting parties/entities-banks with LRA Extension Office revealed that LRA Fees amounting to ₱5,910,386.00 for the period January to October 2020 remained uncollected as of December 31, 2020 This was based on SOAs issued and payments received by LRA for the same period.



	3)	With the exception of the months of March, April, and May 2020 when NCR was placed under Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ), SOAs were not delivered promptly to contracting parties/entities. It was noted that there is a wide gap between the date of receipt of SOAs by the contracting parties/entities and the period covered of SOAs (ex. SOA for Feb. 17 to 29, 2020 received by the party/entity on September 16, 2020) ranging from nine days to 200 days. This raised a red flag due to the number of days delayed in serving the SOAs. The risk that collections will be invested by banks for an equivalent rate of return of investment is highly possible.



	4)	The procedure in the payment/settlement of accounts showed that although paragraph 5.a provides that LRA shall send the SOA for the period, there was no specific number of days within which Management should prepare the SOA and deliver the same to contracting party/entity. 



	5)	While Management was not able to provide timely SOAs to the concerned party/entity, we noted that there was delay in the payment of LRA Fees by the contracting party/entity ranging from 20 to 191 days from date of receipt of SOA and date of payment as evidenced by Official Receipt.



	6)	Paragraph 5.b of the MOA provides that SOAs shall be settled by concerned party/entity within five days from receipt. There were no existing penalty provisions for failure to settle their accounts within the period stated in the MOA, or that the services being rendered by LRA shall be put on hold or stopped until payment of the outstanding accounts. 



	7)	The delay in collection can be attributed to late delivery of SOA by the LRA  to concerned party/entity-bank as well as lack of provisions requiring the latter to pay penalty in case of default. 



	8)	We recommended that Management revisit paragraph 5 of the MOA  and include the: (i) obligation of LRA within which to deliver the SOA to contracting party/entity; (ii)  provision on specific sanctions/penalty in case of non or late payment of fees by contracting parties/entities; and (iii) provision on temporary stoppage of services until settlement of the outstanding accounts. 



       Management comment

	9)	LRA Management will take into consideration the recommendation of auditors to revisit MOAs and effect necessary revisions.



b)	No period covered on amounts collected



	10)	LRA Fees amounting to ₱3,084,250.00 were collected from contracting parties/entities of the LRA extension office from January to September 2020. However, the period covered of the amount collected cannot be identified. Examination of official receipts showed that the month or period covered of amount being paid by concerned parties/entities-banks was not indicated.



	11)	Payments are being accepted by LRA despite absence of required Order of Payment; and information on the period covered of payments and outstanding balances. 



	12)	According to Management, no Order of Payment was prepared to support payments made by parties/entities. An order of payment, pursuant to Appendix 28 of the GAM, Volume II is a form that requires Payor to indicate the purpose of payment, the bill number and date covered by the payment.



	13)	We recommended that Management prepare an Order of Payment indicating the amount billed and the period covered of the amount being paid. 







       Management comment

	14)	The recommendation requiring the Accounting Division to prepare an Order of Payment that will contain details, such as the period where and to which SOA the payment pertains to, will be considered. 



c)	The SOA did not indicate the account summary for the previous balance, current charges, and payment received 



	15)	Examination of SOA issued by LRA revealed that account summary with information on previous balance, current charges and payments received were not indicated therein. As such, monitoring of outstanding balance/unpaid amount could not be easily monitored.



	16)	We recommended that Management modify the format of the SOA by including account summary for easy monitoring of outstanding balances of the contracting parties/entities with LRA Extension Office.



      Management comment

	17)	The recommendation will be complied with and the SOA format will be modified accordingly.



d)	Payment securities totaling ₱12,000,000.00 were not deposited to LRA Trust account, thereby exposing LRA to losses due to client’s possible failure to settle outstanding obligations in connection with LRA Extension Office (EO) Project. 

	

	18)	 Paragraph 6 of the MOA provides that:



				a)	To guarantee payment of amounts that may be due LRA for services rendered, (client) shall post in favor of LRA, upon signing of this agreement Payment Security in the amount of ₱500,000.00.



				b)	The Payment Security shall be in the form of a Manager’s check (“MC”), payable to “LRA – for the Account of PNB Trust Banking Group as Escrow Agent for Trust Account No. 161144TA01’’, which shall not be encashed by LRA unless (client) has unpaid obligations to LRA pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section.



				c)	Payment Security shall be released to (client) upon termination of this Agreement after all required payments have been made by DBP to the satisfaction of LRA. The MC issued as payment security shall be replaced by a new MC, 15 business days prior to the date of expiry of said MC.



				d)	The Payment Security shall be used by LRA to settle any outstanding obligation of (client) that may not have been settled at the termination of the Agreement, if there is any. The amount or difference therein if there are payments to be charged shall be returned by LRA to (client) within a period of 30 business days from termination of this Agreement.



	19)	There were 24 MOAs with different banks, government agencies, and other private entities where each is required to present a Manager’s Check amounting to ₱500,000.00 as payment security. Manager’s Check shall be utilized in case the contracting party/entity-banks failed to settle their outstanding obligations with the LRA. Hereunder is the list of clients with Manager’s Checks to wit:

	20)	Careful reading of the provisions of Par. 6 requires the contracting party/entity-banks to post security in the form of Manager’s Check payable to LRA and for the Account of PNB Trust Banking Group as Escrow Agent for Trust Account No. 161144TA01, an escrow account for IT Fees of LARES.



	21)	Management disclosed that MCs submitted by clients were not deposited and remained in their possession. Almost all MCs were already stale. 



	22)	Based on the list, only 14 of the 24 existing contracting parties/entities submitted MCs as payment securities. Moreover, the MCs were issued in favor of the LARES trust account instead of the LRA; thus, may result to loss of government resources in case contracting party/entity-banks fail to settle their outstanding obligation as the trust account is exclusively used for IT fees of LARES. 



	23)	It is informed that the 10 contracting parties/entities-banks have not yet submitted the MCs as of to date.



	24)	The provisions of par. 6 did not mention that MCs must be deposited but clients are required to issue a replacement check after the expiration of MCs. This resulted in the expiration of MCs in the possession of Management and left LRA vulnerable to losses should clients fail to settle their obligations.



	25)	The GAM, Volume III provides that Cash-Treasury/Agency Deposit, Trust should be debited to recognize the amount of trust receipts/collections to be deposited to the BTr, which means that payment security shall be deposited with the National Treasury and to be credited upon the use of the fund for its particular purpose.



	26)	The existing provisions of the MOA requiring clients to prepare MCs payable to LARES Escrow Account and the possession of stale MCs do not ensure protection of the government from possible loss of collection and revenue.



	27)	We recommended that Management revisit par. 6 of the MOAs and amend the same requiring all contracting parties/entities-banks of LRA Extension Office to issue Manager’s Check in favor of LRA to guaranty settlement of obligations and deposit the same in the trust account of LRA.



       Management comment

	28)	Management will require all entities with LRA EO to prepare Payment Securities payable to LRA and the same shall be deposited in the Trust Account of LRA. 











Audit of  Land Titling Computerization Project(LTCP) 



Non submission of pertinent documents - LTCP



10)	Supporting documents in the construction, repair and improvement of existing Registry of Deed offices including variations from original proposals as well as justification on causes of delays in the implementation of Land Titling Computerization Project (LTCP) were still not submitted to the Office of the Auditor to determine compliance by LARES to the Build-Own-Operate (BOO) Agreement for the LTCP.



	1)	This is a reiteration/updated observation based on the unimplemented portion of the prior year audit recommendation.



	2)	Records show that on May 26, 2000, the LRA entered into a Build-Own-Operate (BOO) agreement with Stradec Unisys FF Cruz and Confac (SUFC) Consortium, now known as Land Registration Systems, Inc. (LARES), for the implementation of LRA’s own Information Technology Network and Database Infrastructure Project (IT Facility) pursuant to the National Information Technology Plan 2000 (NITP 2000) through the LTCP. The LTCP introduced the automation of functions and processes and standardization of registration procedure under the following five phases of the project:

Phase 

Activities 

Timeframe 

I 

Implementation of the system in the three pilot Registries of Deeds (RoDs), namely: Quezon City, Cebu City, and Paranaque City, the computer center, and Central Office Areas affected 

Within 6 months from issuance of the Notice to Proceed (NTP) 

II 

Completion of site preparation and implementation of the approved systems in the 64 identified RoDs 

Within 16 months from the issuance of the NTP 

III 

Completion of site preparation and implementation of the approved systems in the 43 identified RoDs  

Within 26 months from the issuance of the NTP 

IV 

Completion of site preparation and implementation of the approved systems in the remaining 52 RoDs 

Within 36 months from the issuance of the NTP 

V 

Completion of updating of the NCR Geographic Information System (GIS) in CO into a Land Information System using title data of parcels from each RoD in NCR 

At the end of the final concession period 























	3)	Each phase has a concession period of 10 years from the issuance of the Certification of Acceptance of the IT Facility (CAIF).



	4)	The project has undergone special audit from July 1, 2004 to February 22, 2005 by then Management Services (MS), now Special Audit Office of the COA pursuant to COA MS/TC Office Order No. 2004-025 dated June 11 and August 2, 2004. The Government-Wide and Sectoral Performance Audit Report (MS Report No. 2004-03C) of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Sector of the BOT Program covering the LTCP of LRA was received by LRA Management on June 20, 2005.



	5)	The audit concluded that the LTCP was not efficiently and effectively implemented and the interest of the government and the public was not adequately protected due to delayed implementation of the project and the absence of control mechanism to protect both the government and the public interest.



	6)	Except for Sections 17.01, Article 19 and other sections contrary to the Compromise Agreement, the 2000 BOO Agreement remains in force and effect. The Notice to Proceed (NTP) was issued by LRA to LARES on February 29, 2008 signifying the latter to proceed with the mobilization and implementation of the LTCP.



	7)	On the basis of the Compromise Agreement, the revised timetable for the delivery of the project is as follows:



Phase 

Expected Completion Period  per  Revised Time Table 

Expected Completion Date  per  Revised Time Table 

I 

Within 11 months after issuance of NTP 

January 29, 2009

II 

Within 21 months after issuance of NTP 

November 29, 2009

III 

Within 31 months after issuance of NTP

September 29, 2010

IV 

Within 41 months after issuance of NTP 

July 29, 2011

V 

At the end of final concession period 

July 29, 2021



	8)	As of December 31, 2020, the total amount collected by LARES, Inc., service provider amounted to ₱21.8 Billion and the amount still to be released by LRA amounted to ₱232.4 million, summarized below:

	9)	Review and evaluation of records/documents submitted to the Audit Team and compliance by Management with previous observation/recommendations disclosed that despite huge discrepancy between project cost of ₱3.483 Billion and the amount already collected  amounting to ₱21.8 Billion and the remaining balance representing guaranty deposit to LRA amounting to ₱232.4  million or a total of ₱23.267 Billion including tax withheld  as of December 31, 2020 or 668 percent higher than the original project cost, documents were still not submitted to the Audit Team to justify propriety of the project based on the original proposal.  Further, documentary requirements to justify increase in the cost of the project from original proposal to the increasing cost of the project was categorized per nature of transaction as follows:





a)	Documents pertaining to construction, repair and improvement of existing RoD offices including variations to the original proposals necessary for the conduct of technical review



	10)	Based on the copies of documents obtained from Management, LRA had already issued four CAIFs for Phases 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the LTCP dated November 28, 2008, June 24, 2010, July 5, 2011, and October 28, 2016, respectively. However, the corresponding memorandum attached to each CAIF issued by LRA was not supported with pertinent documents necessary for review, validation and evaluation by the Audit Team. Reported accomplishments in the CAIF for civil works component of the LTCP under the Site Preparation for RoDs with office buildings constructed and renovated relative to the four (4) phases already reported by LRA as completed were not supported with documents as required under COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 requiring, for technical review purposes, submission of contracts with supporting documents shall furthermore be guided by specific documentary requirements outlined in the attached checklist marked as Annexes “A” to “T” of this circular. 



	11)	Section 2.05, Article 2 of the BOO Agreement, LARES, Inc. shall, at its own expense, cause the construction of RoD offices to be implemented in four phases of the Project. LARES, Inc., shall also undertake, at its own expense repair and improvement of existing RoD offices to prepare them for the introduction and smooth operation of the system. These activities were part of the Site Preparation component of the LTCP. The number of RoDs reported by LRA as already completed are as follows:

	12)	However, verification showed that documents relative to the afore-cited civil works component of the LTCP as enumerated under Annexes A, B and C of said circular were not submitted by the Agency to the Office of the Auditor for technical review. The said documentary requirements are as follows:

	14)	We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation that Management submit to the Office of the Auditor pertinent documentary requirements on the construction, repair and improvement of Registry of Deeds offices including variations to original proposals as enumerated in Annexes A to C of COA Circular 2009-001 for the conduct of technical review.







       Management Comment



	15)	Management has not yet commented on this observation.



b)	Pertinent documentary requirements relative to the justification on causes of delays in the implementation of the LTCP



	16)	Management repeatedly insisted that there were no delays considering that majority of deliverables were already completed and that instances such as availability of sites, etc. were factors that were beyond the control of either parties to the Agreement. While the Audit Team maintains that factor such as availability of sites was a  condition precedent to the implementation of the Project and this factor should have already been considered and known by all parties as part of due diligence efforts long before the very start of the Project. The Management however, could not provide concrete documentary evidence of the incidents they have cited in their replies. As such, the same issue is raised in this report to require the Management to provide concrete documentary evidence on the approval for the suspension of work/activity based on the valid grounds to avoid the incurrence of delays in the implementation of the remaining deliverables of the LTCP.



	17)	In CY 2015 Annual Audit Report, it was reported that the Agency had neither imposed a penalty nor stipulated in the BOO Agreement regarding the noted delays in the implementation of the LTCP, to wit:

	18)	As reflected in the table, there was delay in the completion of the second, third and fourth phases of the project. 



	19)	Non-completion of the project is among the cases of default defined in Section 16.01 of the BOO Agreement which provides that delay in construction in excess of 20 percent of the stipulated construction period for each of the five phases of the project constitutes default. 



	20)	Consistently, Management claimed that no delay was incurred. Pertinent documents among others were not submitted to show that indeed no delay was incurred in the implementation by the Service Provider, as follows: 



a)	Notices/requests for suspension of work due to Force Majeure, peace and order and/or failure of site acquisition;



b)	Suspension of work order or its equivalent; and



c)	Resume to Work Order upon cessation of cause/s for suspension to justify delays in the implementation of the Project or to prove that no delays were incurred in the project implementation.



	21)	These documents are necessary in audit to validate whether each party to the Agreement has complied with their respective obligations under Section 15.03, Article 15 of the BOO Agreement which provides that, the party invoking Force Majeure shall a) notify the other party in writing by any means of communication as soon as reasonably possible of the nature of the Force Majeure and the extent to which Force Majeure suspends the affected party’s obligations under this Agreement; and b) resume performance of its obligation as soon as possible after the Force Majeure condition no longer exists and shall formally notify the other party of such resumption.



	22)	In CY 2020, Management provided communications to the RoDs instructing them to provide sufficient space for the implementation of LTCP.  However, no update was further given by Management on the status of development/ accomplishment of the project.  No documents were also provided to justify the delay of LARES in the implementation of the LTCP from Phase I to Phase IV or to substantiate the alleged non-delay.



	23)	We recommended that Management submit to the Office of the Auditor the Requests for Suspension of Work and relevant supporting documents, Suspension of Work Order, and Resume to Work Order or any other supporting documents or series of exchanges of communications to justify the delay which consequently suspend the running of time in the implementation of the LTCP pursuant to Sections 15.01 and 15.03, Article 15 of the BOO Agreement.



       Management Comment



	24)	Management has not yet commented on this observation.



Delayed completion of LTCPs Administrative Support Application Systems



11)	Delayed completion of the Land Titling Computerization Project’s deliverables on administrative support application systems such as Human Resource Management System (HRMS), Physical Resource Management System (PRMS) and Financial Management Information System (FMIS) resulted in various system errors and operational inefficiencies; thus, the objective of the project was not fully achieved.



	1)	Section 2.03(l) of BOO Agreement required LARES, Inc. at its own expense to cause the creation, among others, of the Operations Support databases such as Personnel database, Financial database and Property database.



	2)	The HRMS was intended to support functions such as recruitment, personnel development, and services and records. It must be fully integrated to allow immediate access to all employee functions. The PRMS meanwhile must be fully integrated to support functions such as purchasing, supplies and materials inventory and control, asset management, and accountable forms monitoring. These two systems must be integrated to the FMIS which records and monitors all financial transactions of the Agency.



	3)	The failure of the LRA and LARES, Inc. to work out the timely completion of the Operation Support database systems such as the Personnel, Financial and Property databases resulted in several recurring audit observations which remained unimplemented up to this date by the Agency. Some of these unresolved issues included unreliable balances of accountabilities of cashiers, unreliable balances of PPE and Inventory accounts, and failure to keep and maintain SLs of accounts. All these ultimately resulted in time and manpower resources of the LRA being wasted which could have been utilized to address the more urgent problems and concerns of the Agency such as conduct of cash examination by Management to determine the correct balances of accountabilities of AOs at a given time or monitor possible incurrence of shortage by AOs, conduct physical count of inventory of property and supplies among others. As such, the government is deprived of the most efficient and effective use of its time, manpower and financial resources.



	4)	In CY 2020, LRA submitted work plans from LARES for the completion and operation of PRMS and HRMS. Subsequent documents submitted to this office showed that the PRMS was currently at version 2.0 as of July 7, 2020. Subsequently, changes in specification have been requested by LRA to LARES which is still due for deployment as version 2.1.  Meanwhile, the HRMS version 3.0 was supposedly to be deployed to the end-users on August 14, 2020, however, no document was submitted showing whether the said version was deployed or not or whether the same was already operational.  The submission of documents was in response to the audit recommendation in previous year’s audit report.  But such submissions were not enough for its compliance.  Still, the administrative support application system was not yet operational.



	5)	According to Management, delays were attributed to the testing of specification changes requested by them to LARES. These specification changes were requested for the enhancement of the system. It varies from minor improvements to major improvements on the system which required testing. The testing of newer versions according to them was difficult to conduct as the software was installed in the computers stationed at the premises of LRA. It required the physical presence of both the personnel from LRA and LARES which during most of CY 2020 both LRA and LARES, Inc. were implementing skeletal workforce due to the implementation of the Community Quarantine.    



	6)	The delay in the completion or integration of various modules of the Financial Management Information System (FMIS) by LARES, Inc. also resulted in the failure of the agency to efficiently and effectively carry out controls to check real time whether all cashiers nationwide were depositing/ remitting their collections daily and intact. Personnel of the Revenue Section still resorted to manual verification on whether or not collections were deposited intact and daily. The Revenue Section could not utilize the technology from LTCP to identify on time the defaulting cashiers. In addition, the observation on erroneous recordings due to the deficiency in the process flow on the procurement of goods is discussed in the observation on PPE.



	7)	We recommended that Management require the Project Management Executive Committee to closely and strictly supervise and monitor the project work schedule as planned and work out with LARES, Inc. any remedial measures for the immediate completion of the remaining deliverables under the Operations Support as stipulated in the Build-Own-Operate (BOO) Agreement.  If necessary, issue Office Orders for the attendance of the required LRA personnel in close coordination with LARES, Inc. personnel so as to pursue necessary testing of software installed in computers located in LRA offices. Otherwise, impose penalty as warranted unless supported with pertinent documents enumerated in COA Circular 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 to rationalize cause/s for the incurrence of delay or suspension of work as the case may be.



       Management Comment



	8)	Management has not yet commented on this observation.





Lack of transitory provision and contingency plan at the termination of Concession Period 



12)	The Build Own Operate (BOO) Agreement between LRA and Land Registration System, Inc. (LARES) lacks transitory provision in case of termination of the concession period and/or the BOO Agreement.  Likewise, no contingency plan has been presented by LRA to ensure the continuity of the Land Titling Computerization Project (LTCP) 



	1)	The BOO Agreement provides that the concession period is for a period of 10 years from the issuance of the CAIF which may be extended up to three (3) years prior to its expiration as indicated in Section 1.11 of the BOO Agreement quoted below:.



Concession Period- as understood herein shall be for a period of 10 years from issuance of a Certificate of Acceptance of an IT Facility (CAIF). Hence, each phase of the project shall have a concession period of 10 years from the issuance of CAIF on each phase, subject to extension within three years prior to the expiration of each concession period as may be authorized by law and concerned authorities. As the Central Office operates from Phase I to Phase V of the Project, it is understood that the Central Office operations remain with the Project Proponent until the end of the last concession period.



	2)	A Notice to Proceed (NTP) was issued by LRA to LARES on February 29, 2008 and on this basis, the revised timetable for delivery of the project is as follows:



Phase 

Expected Completion Period  per  Revised Time Table 

Expected Completion Date  per  Revised Time Table 

I 

Within 11 months after issuance of NTP 

January 29, 2009 

II 

Within 21 months after issuance of NTP 

November 29, 2009 

III 

Within 31 months after issuance of NTP

September 29, 2010 

IV 

Within 41 months after issuance of NTP 

July 29, 2011 

V 

At the end of final concession period 

July 29, 2021 



	3)	Other than the above-mentioned provision of the BOO agreement wherein extension of the LTCP is possible within three years before the expiration of the concession period. There was no other provision detailing the procedures and recourse of LRA given this situation.



	4)	As shown in the table above, the expected completion of Phase V or the end of the concession period is on July 29, 2021. However, inquiry with Management to provide this office with details on how the Agency intends to move forward with the project proved to be unfruitful. 



	5)	Based on the copies of documents obtained from Management, the LRA has already issued four CAIFs for Phases 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the LTCP dated November 28, 2008, June 24, 2010, July 5, 2011, and October 28, 2016, respectively.  However, such CAIFs were not duly supported with the IT and Civil works Infrastructure delivered.  This matter was discussed fully in Observation No 6.



	6)	Initial information gathered about the remedy in mind by Management during the meeting held with the representative of LARES on the status of training to capacitate LRA personnel and to prepare them during turn-over of the project at the end of the concession period was legislative enactment which is too lengthy, difficult and its passage will take years to materialize because it entails a lot of justifications on the part of LRA to request for additional budget to change current LRA personnel plantilla aside from funding source for additional personnel to handle the LTCP. Management did not mention or considered Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) for possible measure/assistance to increase the capability of the Agency during the transition period if the concession period will not be extended. They even considered extending the concession period using the above provision of the BOO Agreement.



	7)	Likewise, Audit Query Memorandum (AQM) No. 2021-01 dated May 3, 2021 was issued to Management to inquire about the matter and requested for submission of any existing contingency plan in case of completion of the concession period.  We also requested for an information on whether the agency had made coordination with the DICT and other government agencies for possible measure/assistance to increase capability of the Agency during transition period if the concession period will not be extended. However, Management’s  response has yet to be received by this Office.   



	8)	One of DICT’s missions is to provide every Filipino access to vital infrastructure and services.  DICT also has the power and function to ensure development and protection of integrated government ICT infrastructures and designs, taking into consideration inventory of existing manpower, plans, programs, software, hardware, and installed systems.



	9)	The absence of a transitory provision and a contingency plan would put the Agency in a disadvantageous position at the end of the concession period and a matter of serious concern for the continuity of LTCP which will leave government helpless due to too much dependence on LARES, Inc. by extending the concession period for an unknown period of time.









	10)	We recommended that Management:



a)	revisit the BOO Agreement taking into consideration the provision pertaining to the transition process in case of completion of the concession period and/or the BOO Agreement; 



b)	provide a definite contingency and continuity plan in case of completion of the concession period in order not to disrupt the services to the public; 



c)	consider acting now and work on additional skilled ICT personnel complement under the LRA Information and Communication Technology Division (ICTD) with the DBM to handle and man vacated positions of LARES, Inc. personnel to run the system upon the completion of the concession period; and

	

d)	simultaneously coordinate with the DICT, the government arm in information and communications technology, for possible measures/assistance that can be provided/extended to bridge the gap and ensure the capability of the Agency in the transition period and handling the systems to confidently continue the LTCP even after the end of the concession period without need of extension.

Non-submission of Approval from NEDA of IT Fees

           

13)	The validity of some Information Technology (IT) Service Fees being collected by LRA was doubtful due to non-submission of document evidencing approval from National Economic Development Authority - Investment Coordination Committee (NEDA-ICC) as provided under Section 12.11 of the Revised IR of RA No. 6957, as amended by RA No. 7718.



	1)	Section 12.11 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 6957 as amended by RA No. 7718 provides that: A contract variation may be allowed by the Head of the Agency/LGU, Provided, that:



a)	There is no impact on the basic parameters, terms and conditions as approved by the Approving Body; or 



b)	There is no increase in the agreed fees, tolls and charges or a decrease in the Agency/ LGU’s revenue or profit share derived from the project, except as may be allowed under a parametric formula in the contract itself; or



c)	There is no reduction in the scope of works or performance standards or fundamental change in the contractual arrangement nor extension in the contract term, except in cases of breach on the part of the Agency/LGU of its obligations under the contract; or d. There is no additional Government Undertaking, or increase in the financial exposure of the Government under the project.



	2)	Upon due diligence and recommendation of the Head or Agency/LGU, contract variations not covered by above shall undergo approval by the Approving Body in terms of the impact on government undertakings/ exposure, performance standards and service charges. Failure to secure clearance/ approval of the Head of Agency/LGU or Approving Body as provided in this section shall render the contract variation void. The Agency/LGU shall report to the Approving Body and the PPP Center on any contract variations including those approved by the Head of Agency/LGU. (Emphasis Supplied)



	3)	Based on the cited provisions, the Land Registration Systems, Inc. (LARES) may introduce other services under the Land Titling Computerization Program (LTCP) and charge additional IT Service Fees subject to the approval of the NEDA-ICC as the approving body.



	4)	Among the services introduced by LARES thru the LTCP were the LRA Extension Office Project and the Geo-Spatial Query System wherein LARES imposed IT Fees.  Further, IT Service Fees were likewise imposed for each page in excess of the first two pages for some transactions pursuant to LRA Circular 08-2012.



	5)	The table below shows the summary of additional IT fees imposed by LARES.

P128,032.00, vat exclusive, per kilometer, which shall be assessed proportionately based on the actual length of the alignment of interest as specified by the client (with revenue share in favor of the government of 7 percent)

2b. Soft copies   of the list of titled properties (Section 3.1 (d) and 4.4 of the MOA)





3.      IT Service Fee chargeable for each page in excess of the first 2 pages in the Issuance of True Copies of Subdivision Plans, Technical Descriptions, Decrees of Registration , Certificates of Title, and Other Documents

All transactions that may involve the said service

20 percent of the base fee  subject of previous publications on  rates of IT Service Fees in the Issuance of True Copies of Subdivision Plans, Technical Descriptions, Decrees of Registration, Certificates of Title, and Other Documents



	6)	The Audit Team sent letters dated December 4, 2020, February 4, 2021 and February 5, 2021 to Management in addition to the verbal request to provide the Office of the Auditor necessary documents showing approval from NEDA-ICC.  However, no documents evidencing approval was submitted to the Office of the Auditor. Without approval of the proper authority, contract variation was rendered void as provided in Section 12.11 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 6957 as amended by RA No. 7718. More so, the  imposition of IT fees was detrimental to the transacting public as they were required to pay higher fees.



	7)	Among the three items/transactions mentioned in the immediately preceding table, the Audit Team selected two item due to the amount of fees involved as stated above.  On the basis of the LRA Resolution dated August 5, 2016 as mentioned in the table, it can be inferred that fees and revenue sharing for special projects for this type of service as well as IT fees have already been existing since 2016.   For the year 2020 alone, LRA collected   ₱231,436,882.38 for the Geo-Spatial Query System in favor of LARES. The table below provides a summary of collections per month for the aforementioned services rendered by LARES.  Post audit of the 33 ORs amounting to ₱231,436,882.38 disclosed the total amount collected by LRA in favor of LARES, to wit:

	8)	Gleaned from the table above, no collections were recorded during the months of April and May 2020 due to implementation of ECQ in NCR at that time brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Private and government offices were closed except for few activities which were considered essential identified by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF).



	9)	We recommended that Management submit the contract amendments, approval of regulatory bodies and/or other documents, if any, that will warrant collection/charging by LARES of additional fees.

Other Observations 



Legitimacy of supplier of 90 air conditioning units was doubtful  



14)	The legitimacy of the supplier of 90 air conditioning units was doubtful due to conflict between the authority written in the Mayor’s Permit and the transaction entered into with LRA.



	1)	Section 34.3 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 9184 provides that the post-qualification shall verify, validate, and ascertain all statements made and documents submitted by the bidder with the Lowest Calculated Bid/Highest Rated Bid, using a non-discretionary criterion, as stated in the Bidding Documents. These criteria shall consider, but shall not be limited to, the following a) Legal Requirements. To verify, validate, and ascertain licenses, certificates, permits, and agreements submitted by the bidder, xxx  b)xxx.  



	2)	Notice of Award was issued to Fix and Care Ref and Aircon Repair Services, Inc. for the Supply and Delivery of 90 units 2.0 HP GREE Window type Inverter Airconditioner in the amount of ₱2,588,000.40 signed by its representative on February 21, 2020 and with Purchase Order No. S-004-07-2020 dated July 16, 2020 upon recommendation of BAC under LRA BAC-PGSM Resolution No. 2020-007 dated January 29, 2020. Delivery was made as evidenced by DR No. 1462 dated November 23, 2020 and duly inspected and accepted by LRA representatives. 



	3)	Post-qualification was conducted by the Technical Working Group (TWG) on January 21, 2020 in the place of business of Fix and Care Ref and Aircon Repair Services, Inc. It indicated that verification and validation were made as to their licenses and business permits which appeared to be in order.



	4)	However, post-audit of DVs and its supporting documents showed that submitted Mayor’s Permit for CY 2019 indicated that supplier is only registered as a contractor and not a dealer.



	5)	Section 131 (d) of the Local Government Code of 1991 defined Contractor as persons, natural or juridical, not subject to professional tax under Section 139 of this Code, whose activity consists essentially of the sale of all kinds of services for a fee, regardless of whether or not the performance of the service calls for the exercise or use of the physical or mental faculties of such contractor or his employees.



	6)	Section 131 (k) of the same law meanwhile defined a Dealer whose business is to buy and sell merchandise, goods, and chattels as a merchant. He stands immediately between the producer or manufacturer and the consumer and depends for his profit not upon the labor he bestows upon his commodities but upon the skill and foresight with which he watches the market.



	7)	Similar inquiries were also made by other Government Agencies to the Government Procurement and Policy Board (GPPB) regarding validity of a supplier to participate in the procurement process where the line of business required was not included in the submitted Mayor’s permit of the supplier.



	8)	Citing GPPB Non-Policy Matter No. 077-2012 wherein Bacolod City raised the issue of the Nature of Business of the Bidder as stated in the Mayor’s Permit, the GPPB in their response stated that, A Mayor's Permit is in the nature of a business permit which authorizes the person, natural or otherwise, to engage in business or some commercial activity. Consequently, a prospective bidder's business as stated in the Mayor's Permit should at the very least be similar to the project to be bidded. The "Garbage Collection and Hauling" project envisions not simply thepulling, dragging, and transport of garbage, but also the proper collection,transfer, storage, processing, and recycling of Bacolod City's solid waste.Although a construction company collects and hauls materials, aggregates,equipment, tools, and implements in the course of its construction work,such collection and hauling work may not be considered or treated to bewithin the purview of garbage collection and hauling. In addition, appropriate environmental licenses and permits must be secured by a prospective bidder from relevant government agencies, such as but not limited to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), to be able to engage in garbage collection and hauling, which may also factor in safety, sanitary, health, and labor standards, which a construction company engaged in hauling of construction materials, aggregates, and others, may not possess.



	9)	Based on the above GPPB’s response to the inquiry, it can be construed that the Mayor’s Permit is the source of authority to any interested contractors or dealers who wanted to engage in business and therefore controlling factor in determining limitations in doing business, more so that the party contracted on as in this case is a government agency who is duty bound to implement any and all existing laws, rules and regulations. Doing business beyond the permit granted was not allowed. Likewise, the Business Permit of Fix and Care Ref and Aircon Repair Services, Inc. clearly indicates that the kind of business is Contractor – Repair/Maintenance of Air conditioning units and repair of refrigerating units.



	10)	It is the duty of the Bids and Awards Committee to determine the validity of submitted documents to ensure that the lowest calculated bidder is qualified in all material respect to participate in the procurement process and deliver services or goods as required in the contract.



	11)	In this instance, while the supplier presented documents as indicated in the post qualification report that they are authorized dealer of aircon units, the Mayor’s permit presented indicated that they are only allowed to do business as a contractor or a provider of services and not as a dealer as defined by law. Moreover, procurement was only for the supply and delivery of 90 window type air-conditioning units which is only considered as sale of goods.



	12)	One of the governing principles on government procurement is competitiveness by extending equal opportunity to enable private contracting parties who are eligible and qualified to participate in competitive bidding.



	13)	The purpose of the eligibility requirements is to ensure competitiveness and that the supplier is legally capable to fulfill the obligations of the contract.



	14)	We recommended that Management: 

	

a)		submit justification on how the supplier was considered as a legitimatesupplier based on the legal requirements of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 9184 considering that the submitted Mayor’s permit indicated that such was only engaged in contracting services; and 

	

b)		stop transacting business with bidders who are not qualified and require the Bids and Awards Committee and Technical Working Group to refrain strictly from doing the same acts, observe and be guided by the provisions of RA 9184 in determining validity and legality of requirements submitted by the supplier and to be more vigilant in the performance of duties entrusted to them.



       Management Comment



	15)	The matter will be referred to Bids and Awards Committee - Procurement of Goods, Services and Materials (BAC-PGSM) for them to study the findings and prepare the corresponding justification/explanation for immediate submission to COA.





No Cost-benefit/comparative market price analysis was conducted for rental rates 



15)	Cost-benefit/comparative market price analysis was not conducted by the agency in the lease of office space for use of various Registries of Deeds with total approved contract cost of more or less ₱13.1 million as required under the Guideline on Lease of Real Property and Venue, Annex ‘’H” of the 2016 IRR of RA No. 9184, Section V.D.9(d) of the 2016 IRR of RA No. 9184; thus, contracts entered into could not be determined if favorable to the Agency.



	1)	Section 53.10 of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act states that, Lease of real property and venue for official use is subject to Annex “H” of the IRR.



	2)	Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Resolution No. 06-2018 added a new provision to Section V.D.9. (d) of Annex “H” of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 9184, which states that prior to the expiration of the lease contract, the end-user of the procuring entity must conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the lease. For instance, it must compare the rental rates charged by its lessor against other lessors in the area. It must also analyze whether entering into a new contract will be more expensive taking into consideration the cost of transfer and accessibility to the public. In assessing the existing lease, PEs are encouraged to consult relevant government agencies regarding any new policy or directive in the lease of real property.



	3)	The Agency thru its various RoDs nationwide entered into contract of lease with various lessors for rental of office space. These contracts were represented by the Deputy Administrator of LRA as lessee and private individuals or corporations as lessors. 



	4)	It was noted that a number of these contracts were entered into with the same lessors yearly for RoDs’ office space needs.



	5)	The Revised IRR of RA 9184 under Section V.D.9 (d) which is a new provision now requires the agency to conduct a cost-benefit/market analysis on the renewal of contracts of lease. The purpose is to assess the quality of service under the lease contract. It provides that by comparing rental rates charged by its lessors against other lessors in the area, analyze whether entering into a new contract will be more expensive taking into consideration the cost of transfer and accessibility to the Public.



	6)	Our review of the 26 contracts of lease totaling ₱13,102,998.96 and post audit of related DVs amounting to ₱12,358,882.90 as at December 31, 2020 revealed that the required cost benefit analysis was not included in the  supporting documents.



	7)	Verification disclosed that the agency had processed and approved 34 DVs amounting to ₱2.46 million as of April 30, 2019 for these rentals even if some documents were lacking, contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. 



	8)	Management disclosed in an interview that during CY 2020, an effort was made to comply with the provisions. The General Service Department (GSD) is still in the process of reviewing the 2020 cost benefit analysis. This practice contravenes the new provision stated in the Guidelines on Lease of Real Property and Venue under Annex H of the 2016 IRR of RA 9184,to wit:



	9)	If the results of the cost benefit analysis conducted by the end-user, continue to favor the existing lessor, then the Head of the Procuring Entity (HoPE) may simply renew its lease contract. If it does not, then the PE should procure a new lease contract in accordance with Section 53.10 of the IRR of RA 9184 and this guideline. For efficiency and economy, during the effectivity of the contract, or upon its renewal, the PE may consider the expansion or reduction of the space provided by the existing lessor, provided GPPB Resolution No. 06-2018, dated 18 December 2018 Page 3 of 4 that the leased premises can accommodate the space requirements of the PE in case of expansion, based on the need of the PE and the best way by which such need may be addressed and satisfied, subject to existing budgeting, accounting and auditing rules.



	10)	The process of reviewing the cost benefit analysis after the contract of lease was renewed will no longer serve the purpose for which it was required.



	11)	The amendments to the guidelines on the renewal of contract of lease of real property were made to ensure that contractual arrangements with service providers continue to be favorable to the interest of the government and thus, remain consistent with the principles of RA No. 9184.



	12)	This is a reiteration of a prior year audit observation with updated data.



	13)	We recommended and Management agreed to:

	a)	strictly comply with the provisions of Annex H of the 2016 IRR of RA 9184 on the Guidelines of Lease of Real Property and Venue in the renewal and new contracts of lease; and 



	b)	ensure that cost benefit analysis is conducted prior to the expiration of the lease contract and renewal of contract is done only if the result of the analysis favors the existing lessor. 



       Management Comment



	14)	The Cost-Benefit/Comparative Market Price Analysis was transmitted to the Office of the Auditor in a letter dated May 14, 2021.



	15)	While the LRA recognized the fact that this Agency must lease government-owned real estate or venue instead of leasing from a privately-owned real estate or venue, however, due to some limitations obtained from scouting areas to be leased, they were constrained to lease available venues/space.



	16)	Nevertheless, the Agency ensures that the following considerations were taken into account to adhere with the Implementing Guidelines for Lease of Privately-Owned Real Estate and Venue; to wit: 1) suitability of area in relation to the mandate of the offices; 2) accessibility to its clients and/or transacting public; 3) level of security in the proposed location/area; and 4) rental rates are within the prevailing market rates.



       Auditor’s Rejoinder



	17)	After careful evaluation, we find that the submitted cost benefit analysis lacked sufficient details and supporting documents to assess the quality of service under the lease contract which warrant its renewal. 



	18)	The cost benefit analysis must clearly show that the end-user/implementing unit compared the rental rates charged by its lessor against other lessors in the area and an analysis on the cost of transfer and its accessibility to the public. These must be supported by appropriate documents to enable the HOPE to assess whether the current contract of lease continues to favor the lessor. However, submitted analysis was only a tabulation of the RoDs, the cost of its monthly lease and summary of its benefits for leasing that particular property without supporting details to validate the data mentioned. It should also be noted that the cost benefit analysis shall be attached to the renewal contract. 



Non-Submission/Delayed Submission of Reports



16)	The Agency had not submitted to the Office of the Auditor various financial records and other monthly, quarterly and semestral reports within the prescribed period contrary to the existing accounting and auditing rules and regulations; thus, deficiency, if any, was not readily identified, and results of audit were not promptly communicated to Management.



	1)	The following financial records, reports together with supporting documents were not submitted for audit within the prescribed deadlines as follows:

       Management Comment



	4)	Management has not yet commented on this observation.





Office of the Auditor not notified on the movement of COs whether retired or transferred

17)	Failure of the agency to provide the Office of the Auditor with timely information on the movement of the collecting officers of the Registries of Deeds who have either retired or transferred from one station to another or to other office precluded the Audit Team from conducting mandatory cash examination pursuant to Item F2, Chapter III of the Revised Cash Examination Manual (RCEM).  Likewise, there was no proper turnover or transfer of   accountability from outgoing to incoming AO/Records/Property Officer/RD in violation of Section 77 of PD 1445; thus, proper accounting of government funds and property could not be undertaken and proper clearance of accountability of outgoing Records/Property Officer was not made.



	1)	Item F2, Chapter III of RCEM provides that the Auditor shall: Perform mandatory cash examination under the following circumstances a) before the AO retires or is separated from the service; b) before he is transferred to another station or office; c) when he goes on extended leave of absence and another AO is designated in his place; and d) when loss of government fund by an AO is reported.



	2)	Section 77 of PD 1445 provides for the Invoice and receipt upon transfer of funds or property, - When government funds or property are transferred from one accountable officer to another, or from an outgoing officer to his successor, it shall be done upon properly itemized invoice and receipt which shall invariably support the clearance to be issued to the relieved or out-going officer, subject to regulations of the Commission.



	3)	It was observed that there was no proper turnover of accountability from outgoing to incoming AO in the following RODs and the Auditor was not informed of the same.

	4)	We recommended that Management strictly comply with the provisions/regulations relative to the proper turnover of accountability and properly inform the Office of the Auditor every time there is movement/change of accountable officers. 



	

	Delayed/Unremitted Collections of Collecting Officers (COs)

18)	Collecting Officers of various Registries of Deeds did not deposit their collections daily and intact and/or not later than the next banking day with the Authorized Government Depository Bank (AGDB) contrary to Section 69(1) of P.D. No. 1445 and Paragraph 32, Chapter II of the RCEM.



	1)	Section 69 (1) of PD No. 1445 states that: Section 69. Deposit of moneys in the treasury. (1) Public officers authorized to receive and collect moneys arising from taxes, revenues, or receipts of any kind shall remit or deposit intact the full amounts so received and collected by them to the treasury of the agency concerned and credited to the particular accounts to which the said moneys belong. 



	2)	Paragraph 32, Chapter II of the RCEM provides that: All COs shall deposit intact all their collections, as well as collections turned over to them by sub-collectors/tellers, with authorized government depository bank (AGDB) daily or not later than the next banking day. Where collections are minimal and daily deposit thereof becomes costly and impractical, the COs shall deposit their collections at least once a week, or as soon as the collections reach ₱10,000.00. They shall record all deposits made in the CRR.



	3)	Results of cash examination conducted by COA auditors in different RoDs  disclosed that collections of cashiers were not deposited intact and/or not later than the next banking day, as follows:

	Non-maintenance of Cashbook /Cash Receipts Record/ Cash Receipt Register

		

19)	The Collecting Officers of different RoDs did not maintain an updated Cashbook or Cash Receipts Register (CRReg) to record their daily collections and deposits as prescribed under Paragraph 7 Chapter II of the RCEM.



	1)	Paragraph 7, Chapter II of RCEM states that: An AO shall maintain his cashbook/CRR/CDR/CkDR and such other records or their equivalents as may be prescribed by the agency’s operating procedures, and reconcile with the accounting records at least quarterly, unless the agency requires a more frequent reconciliation.



	2)	The Cashiers assigned at the following RoDs did not maintain an updated cashbook/CRR/CRReg contrary to the aforementioned provision; thereby, precluding the Audit Team from determining and validating the cashiers’ accountability.

	3)	Moreover, in RoDs in Bacoor, Cavite City, Dasmarinas City, Tagaytay City and Trece Martirez, all in Region IV-A,  the RCDs does not reflect the actual cash on hand of the Cashier at the end of the month; thus, casting doubt on the accuracy, validity and reliability of the reports. In Sta. Cruz, Laguna and Siniloan the CRReg  maintained by the Cashier was not in conformity with the instructions  in Appendix 27, Volume II of GAM.



	4)	We recommended and Management agreed to require all Accountable Officers to prepare and maintain an updated CRR/CRReg/ Cashbook/RCD to facilitate determination of accountability and recording of the transactions in the books. 





AOs handling cash accountability without and/or insufficient fidelity bond



20)	The bonding requirement of Accountable Officers (AOs) prescribed in Section 101 of PD 1445 and Item 4.1 of the BTr Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009 was not adhered to; thus, safeguard against the agency’s funds was not ensured.



	1)	Section 101 (2) of PD 1445 provides that, every accountable officer shall be properly bonded in accordance with law.



	2)	Treasury Circular No. 02-2009, Section 5. 1 likewise provides that: The amount of bond shall be based on the total accountability (cash, property and accountable forms) of the accountable public officer as determined by the Head of Agency.  Provided, the individual maximum accountability of each accountable public officer shall not exceed One Hundred Million Pesos (P100M).  However, the Head of Agency may assign other public officers the excess accountability for a separate Fidelity Bond shall be secured.

	

	3)	Validation of records in various RoDs disclosed that AOs assigned thereat were not properly bonded in violation of the above cited provisions.

	4)	Management reasoned out that there is no insufficiency in the amount of fidelity bond because IT fees are excluded in the computation of average daily collections which is the basis in determining the amount of bond for each AO.



	5)	In COA Legal Opinion No. 021-2021 dated May 5, 2021on whether IT Fees are considered as accountabilities of LRA COs for the purpose of fidelity bond, it states that the IT Fee came into the possession and control of LRA’s COs from the time of collection remain in their accountability until it is remitted to the First Trust Account pursuant to LRA contractual obligation under the Escrow Agreement. By its nature and definition, fidelity bond is issued to assure a public officer of faithful performance of all duties imposed by law; and faithful accounting of all funds and public properties coming into the possession, custody, or control by collections subject of IT Fees.



	6)	We recommended that Management ensure that all AOs whose functions involve custody or control of funds and property are properly bonded in accordance with Par. 4.1 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009 and require earlier submission of applications for bond for timely approval and release thereof by the BTr.





Delayed or Non Submission of RAAF and RCDs to COA 



21)	The Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (RAAF) and Report of Collections and Deposits (RCD) were not submitted within the reglementary period contrary to the GAM, Volume II and Section 7.2.1(a) of COA Circular No. 2009-006. Moreover, the Registrar of Deeds in Regions II and IV-A did not sign the Daily Summary and Monthly Report of Collection and/or RAAF; hence, collections might not be checked if properly collected, reported and deposited/remitted to depository banks intact and on time.



	1)	Appendix 67 of the GAM, Volume II states that,

	            The RAAF is used by each Accountable Officer to report the result of the physical count of all accountable forms, with or without face value such as checks, stamps, official receipts, LDDAP-ADA, etc., in his/her custody. It shall be prepared monthly and by fund cluster.

	This report shall be prepared in two (2) copies and distributed as follows:

	2)	Section 7.2.1(a) of COA Cir. No. 2009-006 dated Sept. 15, 2009 states that:



The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the agency shall ensure that:



a)	The reports and supporting documents submitted by the accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of accounts and submitted to the Auditor within first ten (10) days of the ensuing month; xxx



	3)	The AOs in various RoDs did not prepare and submit to the Office of the Auditor the monthly RAAF regularly, contrary to Appendix 67 of the GAM, Volume II; thus, precluding the Audit Team from determining the total accountability for accountable forms of the AO as of a given period. The following RoDs were non-compliant thereto, to wit:

	5)	Other inconsistencies reported by Regional Auditors also include:



a)	 In RoD Angeles City, Pampanga, some ORs were not reported in the  RAAF;



b)	In RoD Province of Quezon, submitted RAAF did not include Judicial Title Forms (JTF) and security paper/Certification, Certified True Copy and Verification (CCV); and



c)	In RoD Catarman, Northern Samar, Region VIII, serial number of  17 ORs was not reported as issued in the system generated RCD contrary to Section 4.h, Chapter 2 of GAM Vol. I.



	6)	Moreover, the Daily Summary and Monthly Report of Collections and Deposits and/or RAAF of the RoDs in Region II such as Sanchez Mira, Tuao, and in Region IV-A such as Calamba and Nasugbu, Batangas were not signed by the Registrar of Deeds. This implies that reports were not checked by the Registrar of Deeds to see to it that all fees are properly collected, recorded, deposited and remitted to depository banks intact and on time.



	7)	We recommended that Management:



a)	direct the AO to prepare and submit the monthly RAAF, RCD and its supporting documents in prescribed form and within the prescribed period. Further, ensure that all accountable forms in the possession of the AO are reported in the RAAF; and



b)	require the Registrar of Deeds and the Cashier to adhere to LRA Circular 15-2011 on the accountability of all cash collections, deposits and remittance to safeguard cash collections and ensure that these collections are deposited intact and on time.





No enclosed cubicle for COs and/or without/unutilized safety vault to safeguard Cash Collections and Accountable Forms



22)	The AOs of various RoDs were not provided with safe/vault to safeguard their cash collections and accountable forms from loss and or unauthorized use.  If ever provided, the same was not utilized.  Moreover, some cashiers in the RoDs were not provided with enclosed cubicle contrary to Par.h 1, Chapter II of the Revised Cash Exam Manual (RCEM).



	1)	Paragraph 1, Chapter II of RCEM states that: It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with laws and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.



	2)	Sound internal control provides that tangible assets such as cash and records should be physically safeguarded by using a safe or vault.  This is to reduce the risk of misappropriation/theft of cash, destruction of accountable forms, and loss of pertinent records.



	3)	AOs in various RoDs who were not provided with safe/vault and/or enclosed cubicle for the safekeeping of collections, accountable forms, and other relevant documents, are shown below:

	4)	 Moreover, the AO in Calamba City is not utilizing the vault provided.



	5)	We recommended that Management provide enclosed cubicle or safety vault to AOs to protect resources of the government. For those AOs provided with the safe/vault, utilize the same and serve its purpose.





Non-disposal of unserviceable PPE 

23)	Unserviceable and obsolete properties in various Registries of Deeds (RoDs) totaling more than ₱6,929,745.01were not disposed of as required under Section 79 of PD 1445 and Section 40.d Chapter 10 of GAM Vol. I; thus, may expose to further deterioration and entail additional storage cost.  Moreover, the unserviceable items of property in all District Offices in Region VII were not reported in the Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP).



	1)	The following rules and regulations prescribe the basis for disposal of unserviceable property as well as the procedures to be undertaken therefor:



	Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides that x  x  x  when government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence.  If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor or other duly authorized representative of the Commission x x x.

	

	2)	Section 40(d), Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume 1 states that  All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74). X x x.

	5)	In addition, there was no IIRUP prepared and submitted to report the unserviceable properties of all District Offices of the LRA in  Region VII.



	6)	We recommended that Management report all unserviceable and obsolete properties of LRA in the IIRUP and facilitate disposal pursuant to Section 79 of PD 1445.

	



Non issuance/renewal of ICS and PAR

24)	The agency did not renew every three years the Property Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) issued to some employees using the RoD properties contrary to Section 21 Chapter 10 of GAM Volume 1. Moreover, some RoDs did not maintain complete files of PAR or did not issue Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) and PAR to end-users; hence, accountability/custodianship of PPE/properties could not be determined contrary to Section 42 (f) Chapter 10 of the GAM Volume 1.



	1)	Appendix 59 Volume II of Government Accounting Manual presents: The ICS is a form used by the Supply and/or Property Custodian to issue tangible items amounting to less than ₱15,000 to end-user to establish accountability over them.



 Sec.42 (f) Chapter 10 PAR (Appendix 71) –This form shall be used by the Supply and/or Property Division/Unit to report the issuance of PPE and the acknowledgement of the end-user.



	2)	Renewal of PARs every three years were not made in RoDs Cabanatuan City,  Talavera, and in  Province of Nueva Ecija in Region III. The PAR as provided in Section 21, Chapter 10 of GAM shall be renewed every three years or every time there is a change in custodianship/user of the property to establish accountability.



	3)	On the other hand, the RoD in San Pablo in Region IV-A did not issue ICS and PAR to end users while RoD in Leyte Province in Region VIII did not maintain complete files of PAR for issued PPEs amounting to ₱619,488.00.



	4)	We recommended that Management direct the Property Officer to:



a)	issue Property Acknowledgment Receipt (PAR) to end-user of PPE and Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) for tangible items amounting to less than ₱15,000.00; and

25)	The regularity of claims for terminal leave benefits cannot be ascertained due to: a) non-compliance with the requirements on some documents pursuant to COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012; b) unused forced leave not deducted from earned leave credits of various employees; and c) monetization of leave credits of some employees was deducted from sick leave (SL) credits instead of vacation leave (VL) credits.



a)	Non-compliance with COA-Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 



	1)	COA Circular No. 2012-001 provides the following documentary requirements for the granting of terminal leave benefits:



Clearance from Money, Property and legal accountability from CO andfrom Regional Office of Last Assignment

  Certified photocopy of employees leave card as at last date of service duly audited by the Personnel Division and COA/Certificate of leave credits issued by the Admin/HRMO

   Approved leave application

   Complete Service Record

  Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN)

 Certified Photocopy of Appointment/Notice of Salary Adjustment (NOSA) showing the highest salary received if the salary under the lastappointment is not the highest

 Computation of terminal leave benefits duly signed/certified by theaccountant

 Applicants authorization (in affidavit form) to deduct all financialobligations with the employer/agency/LGU (incorporated in the agencyclearance)

 Affidavit of applicant that there is no pending criminal investigation orprosecution against him/her (RA No. 3019)

 In case of resignation, employer's letter of resignation duly accepted bythe Head of the Agency



Additional requirements in case of death



  x x x 



	2)	Post-audit of disbursements vouchers (DVs) for terminal leave benefits claims revealed that the summary of leave cards attached to DVs is being prepared by the Admin staff assigned in the encoding of leave of employees. There is no indication that review of the same was made as it was only the aforementioned staff who signed the document. This implies that leave cards were not duly audited by the Personnel Division. Moreover, the computation of leave credits attached was not duly signed/certified by the Chief Accountant. This non-compliance by Management with the required documents/procedures in the processing of terminal leave benefits increases the risk of errors in the computation of terminal leave benefits.



b)	Unused forced leave not deducted from earned leave credits of various employees 



	3)	Verification of the summary of leave credits attached to DVs for terminal leave claims disclosed that the unused forced leave of 12 employees were not deducted from their leave credits which is not in consonance with Section 25 of the Omnibus Rules on Leave Rule XVI of the Omnibus Rules implementing Book 5 of E. O. 292.



	4)	Sec. 25 –Five days forced/mandatory leave - All officials and employeeswith 10 days or more vacation leave credits shall be required to go vacation leave whether continuous or intermittent for a minimum of five (5) working days annually under the following conditions: (a) The head of agency shall, upon prior consultation with the employees, prepare a staggered schedule of the mandatory five-day vacation leave of officials and employees, provided that he may, in the exigency of the service, cancel any previously scheduled leave (b) The mandatory annual five-day vacation leave shall be forfeited if not taken during the year. However, in cases where the scheduled leave has been cancelled in the exigency of the service by the head of the agency, the scheduled leave not enjoyed shall no longer be deducted from the total accumulated vacation leave (c) Retirement and resignation from the service in a particular year without completing the calendar year do not warrant forfeiture of the corresponding leave credits if concerned employees opted not to avail of the required five day mandatory vacation leave (d) Those with accumulated vacation leave of less than ten (10) days shall have the option to go on forced leave or not. However, officials and employees with accumulated vacation leave of 15 days who availed of monetization for 10 days, under Section 22 hereof, shall be required to go on forced leave.



	5)	The non-deduction of mandatory leave as required in the above provision resulted in the overpayment of terminal leave benefits totaling ₱ 193,375.57. 



c)	Monetization of leave credits of some employees was deducted from SL instead of VL credits 



	6)	It was also noted in the summary of leave cards that monetization of leave credits of seven employees was inappropriately deducted from their Sick Leave credits despite having available Vacation Leave balance. The practice is contrary to Section 22, Rule XVI of the Omnibus Rules on Leave implementing Book 5 of E. O. 292.



	7)	Sec 22. Monetization of Leave credits – Officials and employees in thecareer and non-career service whether permanent, temporary, casual, orcoterminous, who have accumulated fifteen (15) days of vacation leavecredits shall be allowed to monetize a minimum of ten (10) days:Provided, that at least five (%) days is retained after monetization andprovided further that a maximum of thirty (30) days may be monetized ina given year. (Provided for under CSC MC NO. 41 s. 1998)



	8)	From the foregoing, it clearly shows that what is allowed to be monetized are the accumulated vacation leave credits. Section 23 of the Omnibus Rules on Leave Rule XVI of the Omnibus Rules implementing Book 5 of E. O. 292 on the other hand, is an extraordinary measure to relieve an employee from financial difficulties that may be allowed only for valid and justifiable reasons subject to the discretion of the agency head and the availability of funds. Hence, should be construed as an exception to the general rule as provided under Section 22. Consequently, for purposes of monetization, vacation leave credits must be exhausted first before sick leave credits may be used. Xxx.



	9)	The noted deficiencies  may be attributed to the lack of review and audit of the terminal leave claims as required in COA Circular No. 2012-001 thereby  casting doubts on the validity and propriety of disbursements for terminal leave claims of employees.



	10)	We recommended that Management require the:



a)	concerned personnel to audit employees’ leave cards;



b)	Chief Accountant to review and sign/certify the computation of terminal leave benefits; and



c)	concerned personnel to strictly adhere to COA Circular 2012-001 and Omnibus Rules on Leave Rule XVI of the Omnibus Rules implementing Book 5 of E. O. 292 in the processing of terminal leave benefits. 



Management comment



	11)	Upon checking with the Central Records Section, no memorandum circular or any issuances were made/issued to implement compliance to COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. To correct the matter, Human Resource Development Division (HRDD) initiated the issuance of the Memorandum Circular implementing COA Circular 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012.



	12)	Supervising Administrative Officer of Personnel Division-LRA was instructed to conduct the initial audit on the leave cards of the concerned personnel as recommended and to submit results of audit on or before the 31 st day of March 2021.



	13)	The recommendation of the good auditors will be considered and complied with.





Gender and Development (GAD)



26)	The LRA did not submit to the Audit Team the approved GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) duly endorsed by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) in violation of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014. Based on Work and Financial Plan (WFP), the amount of ₱2,400,000.00 was allocated for GAD programs and activities representing .23 percent of its total 2020 appropriations of ₱1,043,612,000.00 which did not meet the mandatory requirement of five percent pursuant to Section 31 of RA No. 11465. Moreover, only ₱144,250.25 or 6.01 percent of the allotted budget was utilized for the purpose.



	1)	Paragraph V of COA Circular 2014-001 states that, the Audited agency shall submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the COA Audit Team assigned to the agency within five (5) working days from the receipt of the approved plan from the PCW or their mother or central offices, as the case maybe. Likewise, a copy of the corresponding Accomplishment Report shall be furnished the said Audit Team within five (5) working days from the end of January of the preceding year. (emphasis supplied)



	2)	Section 31 of the 2020 GAA or Republic Act (RA) No. 11465 states that, all agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement applicable provisions under R.A No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, Convention on the Eliminations of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025), and the Philippine Development Plan (2017-2022). The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets – x x x.



	3)	Section 2.3 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 states that, Pursuant to the MCW and the General Appropriations Act (GAA), allgovernment departments, including their attached agencies, offices, bureaus, state universities and colleges (SUCs), government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs), local government units (LGUs) and other government instrumentalities shall formulate their annual GPBs within the context of their mandates to mainstream gender perspectives in their policies, programs and projects. GAD Planning shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, the cost of implementation of which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their total budgets – xxx.



	4)	For 2020, LRA did not submit the approved GPB as well as Accomplishment Report to the AT contrary to the above provisions. Inquiry with management disclosed that they have prepared the report, however, it was not endorsed by PCW due to their allocation for GAD which was less than 5% of the agency’s budget.



	5)	Management submitted the Work and Financial Plan for GAD and it showed that the allocation was only ₱2,400,000.00, which represents only 0.23% of the total 2020 budget appropriations of ₱1,043,612,000.00. The amount allocated was less than the mandatory requirement of 5%, therefore not in accordance with Section 31 of the 2020 GAA and Section 2.3 of the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01. Out of ₱2,400,000.00 allocated for GAD, only ₱144,520.25 or 6.02% of the allotted budget was utilized. Details are shown below.

	6)	The table shows that only one activity was accomplished for GAD in CY 2020. This may be attributed to poor planning by management as well as noncompliance of the agency with the guidelines set forth in the PCWNEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 as regard the preparation of GAD reports.



	7)	We recommended that Management:



a)	carefully plan the GAD activities, comply with the mandatory GADallocation prescribed by the GAA and PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular 2012-001 and work on the accomplishment of all identified GAD issues in the Annual GPB; and



b)	endorse to PCW the GPB and the GAD Accomplishment Report,thereafter submit to the AT the endorsed reports.



Management Comment

	8)	Management assured that the GAD focal point will exert its effort in ensuring that GAD activities are well-planned and compliant with the existing rules, and that the programmed activities are implemented accordingly.
