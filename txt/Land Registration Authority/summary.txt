	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



A)		Introduction

	

		The Philippine Commission enacted Act 496, known as Land Registration Law created the Court of Land Registration and the office of the Register of Deeds. Upon effectivity of Act No. 2374, the Court of Land Registration was replaced by the General Land Registration Office (GRLO). The GRLO was replaced by the Land Registration Commission (LRC) upon the effectivity of Republic Act No. 1151. On February 9, 1981, Executive Order No. (E.O.) 649 reorganized LRC into the National Land Titles and Deeds Registration Administration (NLTDRA). In a Presidential Memorandum Circular of September 30, 1988, the NLTDRA was changed into the Land Registration Authority. By virtue of E.O. No. 690 dated December 28, 2007, LRA was transferred from the Department of Justice (DOJ) to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). On March 14, 2011, it was returned to the DOJ under E.O. No. 30.     

	

		It is mandated to (a) issue decrees of registration, certificates of title, register documents, patents and other land transactions for the benefit of landowners and beneficiaries of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) and the registering public in general; and (b) provide a secure, stable and trustworthy record of land ownership and interest therein so as to promote social and economic well-being and contribute to the national development.

	

The LRA is headed by Administrator Renato D. Bermejo who is assisted by Atty. Robert Nomar V. Leyretana, Deputy Administrator for Administration and Atty. Ronald A. Ortile, Deputy Administrator for Operations. The LRA’s field offices, which consist of 166 Registries of Deeds, are headed each by a Registrar of Deeds and assisted by a Deputy Registrar of Deeds.  Its Central Office has four departments which supervise 13 division offices.



The LRA was tapped as one of the major implementers of the CARP program by virtue of Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC) Resolution No. 88-4-6, creating the Land Registration Authority-Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (LRA-CARP).



LRA and the LRA-CARP have a total number of 2,533 personnel nationwide, the breakdown of which is as follows:

A)	Scope of Audit



	The audit covered the financial transactions and operations of the LRA and the LRA-CARP for CY 2020.







B)	Independent Auditor’s Report



The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of LRA as of December 31, 2020, due to various misstatements that affects the assets and equity accounts amounting to ₱ 1,320,620,001.82 which exceeded the materiality level of ₱ 31,287,015.41 as shown in Annex A of this report.





C)	Summary of Audit Observations and Recommendations



1)	The Cash accounts totaling ₱9,502,743,499.02 was unreliable due to: a) deficiencies/inconsistencies noted in the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) and/or General Ledger (GL) balances; and b) non-recognition of unadjusted reconciling items and non-recording of releases of IT Fees. Moreover, Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) of Land Registration Systems, Inc. (LARES) Escrow account (Mother Account) were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor since opening of the account sometime in 2008, contrary to Section 4, Chapter 21 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume 1. (Observation No. 1)

We recommended that Management: a) diligently work back on previous records/reports and reconcile with concerned Collecting Officers (COs) records and  effect necessary adjustments to correct unreconciled balances among  General Ledger (GL), Subsidiary Ledgers (SL) and <a href="https://www.coa.gov.ph/phocadownload/userupload/ABC-Help/Financial_Management_Brgy/Annex9.1.2.htm">Report of Collections and Deposits</a> (RCD) including negative balances to present an accurate amount in the financial statements and its supporting records; b) coordinate with LARES to facilitate completion of the system that will present a reliable RCD and likewise include  report number  of RCD as reference of the Accounting Division in their Cash Receipts Journal (CRJ).  Meanwhile, pending completion of the system, maintain detailed breakdown that will support monthly postings in the SL and CRJ; c) direct the Chief Accountant to properly analyze and verify reconciling items in the BRS and effect necessary adjusting/correcting entries in the books of accounts; d) effect necessary adjusting/correcting entries for unrecorded releases of IT fees from the LARES, Inc. Escrow account; and e prepare and submit the BRS for PNB Bank Account No. 1611447TAO1 (mother account) and prepare necessary adjustments for reconciling items, if any, to present an accurate balance of the Cash –in-Bank, Local Currency Current Account. Subsequently, submit the same to the Audit Team for audit purposes.



2)	The cashbook balance or established accountability of COs as of cash examination date did not reconcile with SL balance due to absence of periodic reconciliation between the records of COs and that of the LRA Accounting Division as required in COA Memorandum No. 2013-004.  (Observation No. 2)



We recommended and Management agreed to require both COs and the Chief Accountant of LRA Main Office to exert efforts to immediately reconcile the difference between balances of their respective records. Further, a quarterly reconciliation of accountabilities must be done to ensure accurate and reliable balances.



3)	Non-recording of revenue amounting to ₱6,396,190.00 for CY 2020 was contrary to Paragraph 19 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 9 on Revenue from Exchange Transactions and Section 2.a, Chapter 2 of GAM, Volume I which understated Accounts Receivable and Registration Fees accounts by the same amount, casting doubt on the completeness and reliability of account balances presented in the financial statements.  (Observation No. 3)



We recommended that Management: a) account all uncollected amounts from contracting parties/entities, maintain SL for each contracting party/entity, and prepare corresponding journal entries for appropriate adjustment in the books of accounts; b) record the billings for LRA Extension Office under Accounts Receivable and Registration Fees; and c) request from LARES full access to Philaris for transactions of LRA Extension Office.

	

4)	The balance of the Inventory account totaling ₱62,158,272.31 was unreliable due to: a) accounting errors totaling ₱1,328,144.95; b) unaccounted returned Judicial Title Forms (JTFs) from Registries of Deeds; c) non-reconciliation of Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) for Office Supplies Inventory with the GL, non-updating of SLCs for various Inventory Accounts by LRA and non-submission of Report on Physical Count Inventory (RPCI) by LRA CARP for  Semi Expendable Equipment; d) non-preparation of Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) for issuances totaling ₱372,496.01; and  e) 883 Requisition and Issue Slips (RIS) for accountable forms were not fully accomplished.  Moreover, lost JTFs were not immediately circularized to all Register of Deeds (RoDs) nationwide thus, increasing the risk of fraudulent use of said forms. (Observation No. 4)

We recommended that Management: a) make necessary adjustments/reclassification of accounts to correct the balance of the inventory account in the financial statements and direct the Accountant and Property Officer to be cautious in recording acquisitions and issuances of inventories; b) exert/exhaust all efforts to locate two missing JTFs and present the same to the Audit Team; c) ensure that all requisitions are supported with RIS sequentially/serially numbered for identification purposes; d) complete the inventory taking of JTF to account for the returned and reissued forms and submit inventory report to the Accounting Section for corresponding adjustments in the Inventory account, e) ensure maintenance of complete, updated and accurate Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) for each kind of inventory account and reconcile the same with that of the Property and Supply Section records; and prepare adjustment on any discrepancies noted, if warranted;  f) conduct inventory of Semi Expendable Equipment at the end of every semester and submit the report to the Audit Team within the prescribed period; g) prepare and submit RSMI for the aforementioned issuances and ensure that RSMI is prepared and attached to JEVs in recording supplies and materials issued; h) adopt alternative measures and remedies to ensure completeness of RIS in the issuance of accountable forms and recording thereof and to monitor, safeguard and account the accountable forms; i) issue immediately a Memorandum Circular for the two instances of lost accountable forms; and j) require the concerned AO to immediately report loss of accountable forms duly supported with documentary requirements to facilitate issuance of the circular for the loss of accountable forms.



5)	The balance of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts totaling ₱802,356,930.69 as at year-end was doubtful due to: a) non-submission of the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE); b) unrecorded acquisitions totaling ₱5,614,080.40; c) unrecorded disposals of PPE amounting to ₱7,744,824.54; thus, affecting fair presentation of the account in the financial statements;  d) non-reclassification of completed projects to the appropriate asset account; e) non-maintenance of PPE Ledger Cards for projects under construction and insufficient information in the Index of Payment to support the balance; and f) non-submission of project status as of December 31, 2020.  (Observation No. 5)

We recommended that Management:  a) compel the Register of Deeds (RoDs) to prepare and submit the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) for consolidation in the report of LRA Main Office by using the prescribed form pursuant to Appendix 73 of GAM Volume II; b) instruct the assigned personnel to consolidate reports submitted by RoDs and subsequently submit the RPCPPE to the Audit Team; c) submit also the CY 2019 RPCPPE prepared by the Inventory Team; d) formulate a process workflow on accrual of goods delivered and services rendered on account; e) ensure completeness of documents and information/reference in preparing journal entries to avoid errors/ misstatements/ misrepresentations. Also, this is to avoid journalizing based on assumptions or misinterpretations of facts and not based on correct information and documents; f) adjust/correct erroneous entries in the books of accounts for the unrecorded receipt of PPE; g) direct the Property and Supply Section to submit to the Accounting Division necessary documents showing the manner of disposal whether by donation, sale, destruction as the case may be, date of transfer, transfer JEV, if transferred to another government agency, acceptance report signed by responsible official of recipient government agency among others, of the disposed properties; h) make appropriate entries to derecognize properties disposed of from the books of accounts; i) implement the procedures  prescribed in COA Circular 2020-006 for the one-time cleansing of PPE account; j) require the BAC-infrastructure projects to submit to the Accounting Division the Certificate of Completion and Acceptance issued to facilitate transfer of completed projects to the Building account; k) justify recording of ₱89,155.00 representing Variation Order for the construction of RoD Ozamis building to the Building account despite non- reclassification of the project with 96.82 percent completion under the Construction in Progress account of ₱4,214,833.80; l) submit to the Audit Team  the Certificate of Acceptance issued in favor of RB Soriano Construction on the  Rehabilitation of Sprinkler System of LRA-Central Office; m) effect proper adjustments in the books for the reclassification of completed projects to the appropriate PPE account; n) reconstruct pertinent records and provide the lacking information needed in the Index of Payment; assign Accounting Staff who will handle and maintain PPELC for Construction in Progress account and Index of Payment in the format prescribed in the GAM; and o) provide status reports on the legal action taken against and demand letters issued to defaulting contractors, if any.



6)	The accuracy and completeness of the year-end balance of Current Liabilities accounts totaling ₱116,220,779.51 are doubtful due to: a) erroneous recording of 27 transactions due to lack of coordination between Sections in the Accounting Division and lack of necessary information/ reference/documents; b) unrecorded due and demandable obligations amounting to ₱21,740,051.24; c) misclassification of account amounting to ₱8,956,354.00. d) erroneous adjustment of cancelled checks amounting to ₱1,750,838.49; e) unadjusted/unreconciled discrepancies of ₱1,445,245.53 between the amount withheld and remittances to HDMF per month and deficient balances in previous years; and f) double recording of obligations totaling ₱47,982,080.25; thus, adversely affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the financial statements. (Observation No.6)



We recommended that Management: a) make necessary adjustments/reclassification of affected accounts to correct the balance in the financial statements; b) formulate a process workflow to improve coordination/ communication between Bookkeeping Section and Disbursement Section under the Accounting Division; c) require the Accounting Division to ensure  completeness of necessary information and documentary requirements before processing of claims to avoid commission of erroneous entries; d) make appropriate and necessary adjusting entries in the books and ensure that all due and demandable obligations with valid claims are recorded in the books of accounts; e) require proper coordination between Budget Section and Bookkeeping Section to ensure that reports like Financial Accountability Reports (FAR) No. 3 are accomplished on time; f) make necessary reconciliation before making adjustments/reclassification of accounts. Likewise, direct the Chief Accountant and the Bookkeeping Officer to observe diligence in recording transactions and disclosing information in the Notes to Financial Statements; g) adjust the erroneous entries made in the books of accounts by debiting Due to Pag-IBIG and crediting Accumulated Surplus accounts both amounting to  ₱1,750,838.49; h) prepare necessary adjustment on the noted variance between the amount withheld and amount remitted during the year, if warranted and continue reconciliation of deficient balances in previous years;  i)  prepare adjustment on erroneous entries made in the books of accounts; j) submit supporting documents showing details of obligations taken- up as of December 31, 2020; and k) ensure that all transactions are recorded in the books duly supported with JEV and other documents to facilitate reconciliation of accounts in case of discrepancy. 



7)	The service concession assets and liabilities pertaining to the implementation of Land Titling Computerization Project (LTCP) under the Build-Own-Operate (BOO) Agreement with Land Registration Systems, Inc. (LARES, Inc.) were not recognized in the books of LRA; thus, misstating the affected accounts by undetermined amount contrary to International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 32 – Service Concession Arrangement - and Sections 2(d) and 3(a), Chapter 14 of the GAM, Volume I. Moreover, projects already completed by LARES were not adjusted to the Service Concession Assets and pertinent documentary requirements were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor for proper evaluation.  (Observation No. 7)



	We recommended that Management: a) instruct the Director, Finance Service and the Chief Accountant to account and record in the books the total value of constructed buildings and improvements and other deliverables by virtue of  Certificate of Acceptance of IT Facilities (CAIFs), and provide appropriate disclosures in the Notes to Financial Statements in compliance with IPSAS 32 and Sections 2(d) and 3(a), Chapter 14, GAM, Volume I; and b) submit pertinent documentary requirements on the construction, repair and improvement of RoD Offices located in Ozamis City, Butuan/Agusan del Norte and Batac, Ilocos Norte which LARES took over including variations to the original proposals for the conduct of technical review.



8)	The Government lost approximately ₱1,369,092.17 for the period January to September 2020 due to non- implementation of certain provisions in the Memoranda of Agreement between the LRA and the contracting parties on the operation of LRA Extension Office. (Observation No. 8)



We recommended and Management agreed to: a) revisit paragraphs 4.c, d, and e of the MOAs and implement the annual price adjustment review; b) assign an Office to handle and monitor provisions of MOAs that require review and action by the LRA; and c) compute necessary adjustments on the operating and maintenance fees as well as annual subscription fees based on formula stated in MOAs and implement the same.



9)	Laxity in the implementation of Paragraphs 5.a and b of the Memorandum of Agreement for the LRA Extension Office Project resulted in various deficiencies such as: a) uncollected LRA Fees amounting to ₱5,910,386.00 for the period January to October 2020; b) absence of Order of Payment and details of amount paid for collections amounting to ₱3,084,250.00; and c) lack of information on summary of previous balance, current charges, and payment received in the Statement of Account issued by LRA. Further, payment of securities totaling ₱12,000,000.00 was not deposited to the LRA Trust account; thereby, exposing the LRA to the risk of loss of revenues in case of non-settlement of outstanding obligations by contracting parties/entities with LRA Extension Office. (Observation No. 9)



We recommended that Management: a) revisit paragraph 5 of the MOA  and include the: (i) obligation of LRA within which to deliver the SOA to contracting party/entity; (ii)  provision on specific sanctions/penalty in case of non or late payment of fees by contracting parties/entities; and (iii) provision on temporary stoppage of services until settlement of the outstanding accounts; b) prepare an Order of Payment indicating the amount billed and the period covered of the amount being paid; c) modify the format of the SOA by including account summary for easy monitoring of outstanding balances of the contracting parties/entities with LRA Extension Office; d)  revisit par. 6 of the MOAs and amend the same requiring all contracting parties/entities-banks of LRA Extension Office to issue Manager’s Check in favor of LRA to guaranty settlement of obligations and deposit the same in the trust account of LRA.



10)	Supporting documents in the construction, repair and improvement of existing Registry of Deed offices including variations from original proposals as well as justification on causes of delays in the implementation of Land Titling Computerization Project (LTCP) were still not submitted to the Office of the Auditor to determine compliance by LARES to the Build-Own-Operate (BOO) Agreement for the LTCP. (Observation No.10)



We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation that Management submit to the Office of the Auditor; a) pertinent documentary requirements on the construction, repair and improvement of Registry of Deeds offices including variations to original proposals as enumerated in Annexes A to C of COA Circular 2009-001 for the conduct of technical review; b) requests for Suspension of Work and relevant supporting documents, Suspension of Work Order, and Resume to Work Order or any other supporting documents or series of exchanges of communications to justify the delay which consequently suspend the running of time in the implementation of the LTCP pursuant to Sections 15.01 and 15.03, Article 15 of the BOO Agreement.



11)	Delayed completion of the Land Titling Computerization Project’s deliverables on administrative support application systems such as Human Resource Management System (HRMS), Physical Resource Management System (PRMS) and Financial Management Information System (FMIS) resulted in various system errors and operational inefficiencies; thus, the objective of the project was not fully achieved. (Observation No. 11)



We recommended that Management require the Project Management Executive Committee to closely and strictly supervise and monitor the project work schedule as planned and work out with LARES, Inc. any remedial measures for the immediate completion of the remaining deliverables under the Operations Support as stipulated in the Build-Own-Operate (BOO) Agreement.  If necessary, issue Office Orders for the attendance of the required LRA personnel in close coordination with LARES, Inc. personnel so as to pursue necessary testing of software installed in computers located in LRA offices. Otherwise, impose penalty as warranted unless supported with pertinent documents enumerated in COA Circular 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009  to rationalize cause/s for the incurrence of delay or suspension of work as the case may be. 



12)	The Build Own Operate (BOO) Agreement between LRA and Land Registration System, Inc. (LARES) lacks transitory provision in case of termination of the concession period and/or the BOO Agreement.  Likewise, no contingency plan has been presented by LRA to ensure the continuity of the Land Titling Computerization Project (LTCP). (Observation No. 12)



We recommended that Management: a) revisit the BOO Agreement taking into consideration the provision pertaining to the transition process in case of completion of the concession period and/or the BOO Agreement; b) provide a definite contingency and continuity plan in case of completion of the concession period in order not to disrupt the services to the public; c) consider acting now and work on additional skilled ICT personnel complement under the LRA Information and Communication Technology Division (ICTD) with the DBM to handle and man vacated positions of LARES, Inc. personnel to run the system upon the completion of the concession period; and d) simultaneously coordinate with the DICT, the government arm in information and communications technology, for possible measures/assistance that can be provided/extended to bridge the gap and ensure the capability of the Agency in the transition period and handling the systems to confidently continue the LTCP even after the end of the concession period without need of extension.



13)	The validity of some Information Technology (IT) Service Fees being collected by LRA was doubtful due to non-submission of document evidencing approval from National Economic Development Authority - Investment Coordination Committee (NEDA-ICC) as provided under Section 12.11 of the Revised Implementing Rules of R.A No. 6957, as amended by R.A. No. 7718. (Observation No. 13)

		.

We recommended that Management submit the contract amendments, approval of regulatory bodies and/or other documents, if any, that will warrant collection/ charging by LARES of additional fees.



14)	Cost-benefit/comparative market price analysis was not conducted by the agency in the lease of office space for use of various Registries of Deeds with total approved contract cost of more or less ₱13.1 million as required under the Guideline on Lease of Real Property and Venue, Annex ‘’H” of the 2016 IRR of RA No. 9184, Section V.D.9(d) of the 2016 IRR of RA No. 9184; thus, contracts entered into could not be determined if favorable to the Agency. (Observation No. 15)



We recommended and Management agreed to: a) strictly comply with the provisions of Annex H of the 2016 IRR of RA 9184 on the Guidelines of Lease of Real Property and Venue in the renewal and new contracts of lease; and b) ensure that cost benefit analysis is conducted prior to the expiration of the lease contract and renewal of contract is done only if the result of the analysis favors the existing lessor. 



The foregoing observations and recommendations were communicated with concerned officials of the agency in our letter dated May 25, 2021 for further comment.  Management’s comments and compliance with the recommendations were considered in this report, where appropriate.











D)	Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations
