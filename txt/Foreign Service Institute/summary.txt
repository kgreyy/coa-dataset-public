EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

A. Introduction 
 

The Foreign Service Institute (FSI) was established under Presidential Decree 

(PD) No. 1060 on December 9, 1976 as the career development arm of the 

Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA). It was tasked to provide training to personnel 

of the DFA and other government agencies assigned to the Philippine Foreign Service 

Posts. Since 1987, the FSI has been mandated to provide research assistance to the 

DFA and to participate in the Department’s planning review process. The Philippine 

Foreign Service Act of 1991 or Republic Act (RA) No. 7157 further specified its 

mandate as follows: 

 

a. To serve as the center for the development and professionalization of the career 
foreign service corps; 

 

b. To serve as a research institution for the DFA on issues and problems relating 
to foreign policy, such as bilateral issues, and global and regional strategies; 

and 

 

c. To serve as the institutional consultant of the DFA on foreign policy matters 
as well as in the Department’s development, management, planning and 

review processes. 

 

The FSI is headed by a full-time Director-General who is seconded from the 

Senior Chiefs of Mission in the career foreign service corps. The FSI is composed of 

three major divisions, namely: Carlos P. Romulo School of Diplomacy (CPRSD); 

Center for International Relations and Strategic Studies (CIRSS); and Administrative 

and Financial Services Division (AFSD). As of December 31, 2020, FSI had a total 

personnel complement of 91, consisting of 83 filled-up permanent employees, 3 

casual employees and 5 Contract of Service.

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of the FSI for the CY 2020. It 

was conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the 

Management’s assertions on the financial statements; b) determine the propriety of 

transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and 

regulations; c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and d) determine 

the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations. Moreover, the 

audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 

Institutions. 

 

 

E. Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of 

the financial statements of FSI as at December 31, 2020 

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The significant audit observations and the corresponding recommendations 

were communicated with Management officials concerned, through the issuance of 

Audit Observation Memoranda and discussed during the exit conference on May 13, 

2021, details of which are discussed in Part II of this report. Management views and 

comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate. 

 

1. The completeness and existence of the reported Property, Plant and Equipment 
(PPE) with total acquisition cost of ₱15,152,766.34 could not be ascertained 

due to a) discrepancy of ₱112,000.00 between the accounting records and 

Report on Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE) and b) failure by Management to 

record delivered equipment amounting to ₱65,400.00. 

     

We recommended that Management require the Property Officer and the 

Accountant to regularly reconcile their records such that any discrepancies 

shall be immediately verified and adjusted. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. require the Accountant to record all acquisitions and recognize 
depreciation in accordance with the provisions of Government Accounting 

Manual (GAM); and 

 

b. require the Property Officer to forward the Inspection and Acceptance 
Report  (IAR) and other supporting documents to the Accounting Section 

for the recording of depreciation. 



iv 

 

2. Obsolete items valued at ₱116,777.22 classified in the books as Other Assets 
were not disposed, which the space occupied by said assets could have been 

utilized for other purposes.   

 

We recommended that Management create a Disposal Committee and 

accordingly require them to: 

 

a. recommend the appropriate mode of disposal; 
 

b. perform appraisal of the unserviceable properties still found to be valuable; 
and 

 

c. immediately cause the disposal in accordance with existing rules and 
regulations. 

    

3. The year-end account balance of Due from NGAs (PS-DBM) representing 
undelivered common-used supplies and equipment in the amount of 

₱263,938.40 did not tally with the confirmed balance of ₱167,919.15 with the 

PS-DBM or a difference of ₱96,019.25, rendering the account unreliable. 

 
We recommended that Management require the Accountant to: 
 
a. coordinate with the PS-DBM for the reconciliation of account balances;  

 
b. offset or reapply the reconciled outstanding balance to succeeding 

procurements of common-used supplies, or request for its refund, to avoid 
becoming idle in the hands of PS-DBM; and 

 
c. regularly monitor the advances to and deliveries from PS-DBM. 
 

4. Out of the ₱474,841.52 year-end balance of Other Receivables account, 98 
percent or a total of ₱467,140.08 pertained to undelivered for four (4) years to 

more than 10 years of procured one-year subscription reading materials due to  

lack of monitoring the deliveries thereof.    

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a. exert utmost efforts to locate the whereabouts of the suppliers and 
compel them to settle their accounts; 

 

b. examine other courses of action that maximize effort on the possible 
recovery of the dormant receivables such as sending demand letters to 

the suppliers; and  

 

c. exact accountability of actions from the FSI personnel responsible on the 
deficiency noted.  

 



v 

 

 

G. Implementation of Prior Year’s Audit Recommendations 
 

Of the 38 audit recommendations embodied in the CY 2019 Annual Audit 

Report, 30 were implemented and 8 were not implemented.
