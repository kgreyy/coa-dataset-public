OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Financial Audit 
 

Discrepancy between the Accounting Records and RPCPPE 

 

1. The completeness and existence of the reported PPE with total acquisition cost 
of ₱15,152,766.34 could not be ascertained due to a) discrepancy of ₱112,000.00 

between the accounting records and RPCPPE and b) failure by Management to 

record delivered equipment amounting to ₱65,400.00. 

     
Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume 1 provides the following accounting policies 

and guidelines on PPE, to wit: 
 
Section 42. Accounting and Property Records to be maintained for PPE. The 

Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPE Ledger Card (PPELC) for each category of 
PPE xxx. For check and balance, the Property and Supply Office/Unit shall likewise 
maintain Property Card (PC) for PPE in their custody to account for the receipt and 
disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC 
maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other 
property records like PAR. 

 
Section 42(g). The RPCPPE shall be used to report the physical count and 

condition of PPE by type as at a given date, including those which are unrecorded 
and those which could not be accounted for. Moreover, the Instructions in the GAM, 
Volume III, provides that the RPCPPE shall be reconciled with the PC and the control 
accounts. Any discrepancies shall be immediately verified and adjusted. 

 
As of December 31, 2020, the PPE accounts of the FSI had an aggregate cost 

of ₱15,152,766.34 total accumulated depreciation of ₱9,437,483.50, hence, a total 
carrying amount of ₱5,715,282.84. 

 
a) Discrepancy between the Accounting Records and RPCPPE 

 
Comparison of the account balances as recorded in the books of accounts as of 

December 31, 2020 and the result of physical count disclosed a difference of 
₱112,000.00 as follows: 

 

PPE Accounts 
Per Accounting 

Records 
Per RCPPE Variance 

Office Equipment 5,611,006.30 5,611,006.30 0.00 

ICT Equipment 5,891,492.74 6,003,492.74 112,000.00

Total 15,152,766.34 15,264,766.34 112,000.00

The responsibility of the Inventory Committee does not end with the 

preparation of physical inventory report. In addition, the purpose of physical 

inventory would be defeated if reconciliation with the accounting and property 

records is not made. 

 

The above noted deficiencies casted doubt on the completeness and existence of 

the reported PPE accounts balance.  

 

We recommended that Management require the Property Officer and the 

Accountant to regularly reconcile their records such that any discrepancies shall 

be immediately verified and adjusted. 

 

Management commented that the difference of ₱112,000.00 pertained to two 

items of ICT Equipment which were delivered in December 2020 but Inspection and 

Acceptance Report (IAR) was not immediately forwarded to the Accounting Unit for 

journal entry voucher (JEV) preparation and January 2021. The Accounting Unit has 

recorded the amount of ₱112,000.00 in the books of accounts for January and March 

2021. 

 

b) Unrecorded delivered equipment  
 

Section 20, Chapter 10 of GAM, Volume I provides that “Deliveries of PPE 

shall be recorded immediately in the Property Card maintained by the Supply and/or 

Property Unit on the basis of the IAR and other supporting documents. The IAR and 

other supporting documents shall be forwarded to the Accounting Section/Unit for 

the recording of deliveries in the books of account through JEV and in the PPELC. 

Based on the IAR and other supporting documents the Supply and/or Property Unit 

shall prepare the DV and submit to the Accounting Section for the processing of 

payment.  

 

Under Fund 101, procurement of ICT Equipment in the amount of ₱65,400.00 

was not booked up by the Institute understating the PPE account by the same amount 

and the related depreciation charge for the year. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) require the Accountant to record all acquisitions and recognize depreciation 
in accordance with the provisions of GAM; and 

 

b) require the Property Officer to forward the IAR and other supporting 
documents to the Accounting Section for the recording of depreciation.

Non disposal of unserviceable properties 

 

2. Obsolete items valued at ₱116,777.22 classified in the books as Other Assets 
were not disposed, which the space occupied by said assets could have been 

utilized for other purposes.   

 

NBC No. 45 refer to the disposal of government property which are 

unserviceable, obsolete, forfeited, abandoned, excess to the needs of the government 

or junk or scrap materials. Moreover, government property refers to equipment 

purchased or owned, stocked and used by the government in its operations. 

 

Disposal of unserviceable assets may be undertaken through several modes that 

include condemnation/destruction, transfer, barter, donation and sale either through 

competitive bidding or negotiated sale.  

 

Review of the agency’s books of accounts Other Assets revealed that the 

agency had unserviceable/non-functional properties items with total acquisition cost 

of ₱116,777.22 which remained undisposed. Details presented as follows:

The inability of the agency to effect immediate disposal of the unserviceable 

properties precluded the use of the space occupied by said assets which could have 

been utilized for other purposes. 

 

We recommended that Management create a Disposal Committee and 

accordingly require them to: 

 

a) recommend the appropriate mode of disposal; 
 



34 

 

b) perform appraisal of the unserviceable properties still found to be 
valuable; and 

 

c) immediately cause the disposal in accordance with existing rules and 
regulations. 

 

Management comment: 
 
The Disposal Committee was reconstituted to: perform inspection, appraisal 

and valuation of unserviceable equipment and property; recommend appropriate 
mode of disposal, and cause the disposal of property. A public bidding will be 
conducted in June 2021. 

 

 

Unreconciled difference of PS-DBM undelivered items with the  

 

3. The year-end account balance of Due from NGAs (PS-DBM) representing 
undelivered common-used supplies and equipment in the amount of 

₱263,938.40 did not tally with the confirmed balance of ₱167,919.15 with the 

PS-DBM or a difference of ₱96,019.25, rendering the account unreliable. 

 
As of year-end, the balance of the Due from NGAs (PS-DBM) amounted to 

₱263,938.40 representing undelivered common-used supplies and equipment. To 
verify the correctness of the recorded balance, confirmation letter was sent to PS-
DBM where it yielded a difference of ₱96,019.25.   

 
This has been the subject of a previous year’s observation where it was 

recommended to reconcile with the PS-DBM records. Management explained that 
PS-DBM, after their meeting, are willing to pay the amount due to FSI once both 
records are reconciled.  However, as of December 31, 2020, the unreconciled 
difference, instead of being settled, had increased from the previous year’s 
₱11,155.67 to ₱96,019.25. 

 

We recommended that Management require the Accountant to: 

 

a) coordinate with the PS-DBM for the reconciliation of account balances;  
 

b) offset or reapply the reconciled outstanding balance to succeeding 
procurements of common-used supplies, or request for its refund, to avoid 

becoming idle in the hands of PS-DBM; and 
 

c) regularly monitor the advances to and deliveries from PS-DBM. 
 

  

 

 

 



35 

 

Management comment: 

 
The Supply Office of General Services Section (GSS) has coordinated with the 

representatives of the PS-DBM for a meeting to reconcile both records for the years 
2019 and 2020. A remittance of ₱87,718.51 was made with the BTr for the unutilized 
advances, and was recorded in March 2021. 

 

Dormant Receivables of undelivered subscription materials 

 

4. Out of the ₱474,841.52 year-end balance of Other Receivables account, 98 
percent or a total of ₱467,140.08 pertained to undelivered for four (4) years to 

more than 10 years of procured one-year subscription reading materials due to  

lack of monitoring the deliveries thereof.    

 
One of the functions of the FSI is the provision of library services to various 

clienteles such as personnel of government agencies, students, members of the 
academe and other researchers particularly on matters of foreign service, diplomacy 
and international relations.  To address this task, FSI maintains the Carlos P. Romulo 
Library that houses volumes of books and periodical subscriptions on journals and 
magazines. 

 
As at December 31, 2020, the account Other Receivables posted a balance of 

₱474,841.52 of which ₱467,141.74 pertained to undelivered one-year subscriptions 
of magazines, journals and other publications.  Details of the ₱467,141.74 are as 
follows:

The long-dormant balances indicate lack of monitoring on purchases that results 
in waste of government resources. Efficient management of government resources is 
among the major responsibilities of every government agency.  Measures must be 
installed to prevent wastage and loss of public funds and properties. 

 

Sec. 3.a.1, Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM states that: 

 

It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the 

government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance 

with laws and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage 

through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring 

efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of 

government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is 

faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the 

government agency concerned. (Sec. 2, P.D. No. 1445) 

 
It is noted that the PO on the subscriptions contained a penalty clause of one-

tenth (1/10) of one percent for everyday of delay.  However, the FSI failed to impose 
such penalty when the suppliers defaulted. 

 

Observations on the lack of monitoring on deliveries of reading materials has 

been discussed in the audit report of prior years, and was recommended that FSI 

should locate the whereabouts of the suppliers to recover the amounts paid plus 

penalties, to no avail. 

 
Management was advised that it should further examine the courses of action 

to be taken to maximize effort on the possible recovery of the dormant receivables, 
however, for those dormant account of 10 years and more, if collection proved futile, 
an appropriate request for authority to write-off dormant accounts should be filed 
strictly in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005. One of the supporting 
documents for the request to write-off dormant receivable, as stated under Section 
8.3 therein is proof of exhaustion of all remedies to collect receivables, to wit: 

 

Section 8.3. The request shall be supported by the following 

documents: 

xxx 

b. Certified relevant documents validating the existence of the 

conditions, as applicable, such as: 

xxx 

b.6 Proof of exhaustion of all remedies to collect the receivables 

and demand to liquidate the cash advances and fund 

transfers, such as but not limited to copies of served or 

returned demand letters. 

xxx 

b.8 Certification by the responsible officials of the entity to the 

effect that there are no records/documents available to 

validate the claim. 



37 

 

b.9 Other justifications, like in the case of request for write-off 

due to loss of documents, the circumstances of the loss 

should be stated in the letter request. 

 
The non-moving/dormant accounts casted doubts on the certainty/reliability of 

the balance of FSI’s other receivables. 
 
Management commented that CFI had requested authority to write-off those 

accounts of 10-years and above dormancy from the DFA Audit Team but approval 
was not granted since the documents showing proof of exhaustion of all remedies to 
collect the receivables were not presented. The Institute will closely monitor status 
of the accounts. 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a) exert utmost efforts to locate the whereabouts of the suppliers and compel 
them to settle their accounts; 

 

b) examine other courses of action that maximize effort on the possible 
recovery of the dormant receivables such as sending demand letters to the 

suppliers; and  

 

c) exact accountability of actions from the FSI personnel responsible on the 
deficiency noted.  

 

 

B. Compliance Audit 
 

Deficiencies in the Enhanced and Expanded Foreign Language Programs due to lack 

of proper monitoring and lapses of internal control: 
  

5. Lack of proper monitoring and laxity in the enforcement of the submission of 
required documents as required in the signed Scholarship Service Contracts, 

indicated lapses in the internal control, affecting the timely review and 

evaluation process and the assessment of the effectiveness of the Programs.  

With the promulgation of RA No. 7157, or the Philippine Foreign Service Act 
of 1991, the mandate of the Institute was revitalized and expanded. Title VIII – 
Foreign Service Institute, Section 57 of the RA No. 7157 states the functions of the 
FSI as follows:  

 
The Institute, through its academic, training, research, information, 
publication, systems development and other programs, shall serve 
as the center for the development and professionalization of the 
career corps of the foreign service of the Department and other 
government agencies which have offices and employees assigned 
abroad. xxx 



38 

 

 
In pursuit of its mandate, the Institute; thus, designs and conducts training 

programs appropriate to the needs of personnel of the DFA and those of other 
government agencies who will be assigned to Philippine Foreign Service posts. 

 
The Enhanced and Expanded Foreign Language Programs, thru the foreign 

language scholarship program, aims to develop a pool of foreign language proficient 
personnel in the DFA, particularly in French, German, Spanish, Mandarin, Nihongo, 
Russian, Bahasa Indonesia and Arabic languages. It also aims to enable the 
participants to effectively represent the Philippines, and to be able to communicate 
confidently during informal meetings, and other social functions with their 
diplomatic counterparts. On the other hand, the Language Programs Section (LPS) 
implements the Special Language, and Cultural Appreciation Activities which aims 
to provide participants an opportunity to experience, better understand and appreciate 
foreign cultural practices and tradition, and to make them appreciate the language 
better in this context 

 
Review and evaluation of the submitted disbursement vouchers (DVs), 

supporting documents and related policies and guidelines for the implementation of 
the Enhanced and Expanded Foreign Language Programs for the period January 2019 
to June 2020 disclosed the following deficiencies due to lack of proper monitoring 
and lapses of internal control: 

 

a) Non-submission of Official Receipts (ORs) for the payment of tuition fees and 
accommodations. 

 
ORs aggregating ₱8,360,290.48 for the payment of tuition fees and 

accommodation were not attached to the DVs and the supporting documents. Only 
the invoice and the customer’s copy of the electronic fund transfer were attached to 
the DVs. It is FSI’s practice to pay directly to the bank account of the International 
Training Institution via electronic fund transfer through the Land Bank of the 
Philippines (LBP). Under the terms and conditions of the Foreign Language Service 
Contract, the Grantee and the Foreign Service Post (FSPs)/Consular Office (COs) 
will transmit the original OR to the FSI Finance Section via pouch, however, the 
Cashier disclosed that the ORs were not yet received or submitted to the Finance 
Section. Accordingly, these were not also submitted to COA Audit Team.  (See 
Annex D) 

 
Generally, the objective of examining the evidence of receipt of payment is to 

establish that the funds disbursed have actually been received by the payee so that 
any liability arising from the claim has indeed been extinguished or reduced in the 
amount received by the payee; hence, the non-submission of the official receipts 
affected the validity and propriety of the disbursements. 

 

 

 



39 

 

b) Not all FSPs and COs grantees/scholars have submitted the required Post 
Training Reports (PTRs) and Certificate of Completion. 

 
Review of the submitted List of Foreign Language Grantees and Status as of 

November 30, 2020 disclosed that not all the required PTRs and Certificates of 
Completion were submitted by the concerned grantees from FSPs and COs who 
completed the training, contrary to the signed Service Contracts; thus, effectiveness 
of the programs could not be assessed. (See Annex E)  

 

c) Non-submission of Liquidation Reports (LRs), Report of Disbursements (RDs), 
Report of Fund Transfer and ORs 

 
On December 20, 2019, the FSI and the DFA entered into a Memorandum of 

Agreement (MOA), wherein the FSI upon acceptance of the intention to avail of the 
FSI’s Foreign Language Scholarship agreed to fund transfer the payment of allowable 
expenses such as tuition fees (TF), registration fees, test fees, books and learning 
materials and transportation expenses to the DFA through the Philippine Embassies 
(PE) Brazilia, PE Kuala Lumpur, PE Rome, PE Tokyo and Philippine Consulate 
General Chongqing. The concerned FSPs shall provide account information and 
ensure that relevant documents to support the disbursement of fund and for purpose 
of liquidation shall be submitted to FSI thirty (30) days upon completion of the 
scholarship program.   

 
In the said MOA, the concerned FSPs are required to submit the LRs, RDs, 

Report of Fund Transfer and original copies of ORs. Per inquiry, the Training Section 
will monitor the submission of the said documents, however, the said documents were 
not yet submitted to FSI’s Finance Section for record purposes and eventual 
submission to COA Audit Team for review, to wit:

The non-submission of the LRs, RDs and supporting documents with a total 

amount of ₱1,389,121.33 affected the validity and propriety of the disbursements. 

 
In addition, it was noted that the database prepared by the CPRSD indicated 

only the name of grantee, foreign language program, venue and period of training. 
It did not include the name of Institution/School, Status of the Training and the 
allowances/entitlements granted to the scholars, which are crucial to the proper 
monitoring of the status and for future reference of the DFA before the FSP 
assignment of the grantee. 

  
Moreover, it was learned that although post-training evaluation was 

undertaken, there was no monitoring mechanism to determine how the 
scholars/grantees made use or applied the foreign language they have learned. 
Hence, assessment on the success of the program in terms of the attainment of its 
objective, was not properly measured. 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a) require the grantee/FSPs/COs to submit the lacking documents and ensure 
that the documents submitted to the COA Audit Team are complete in 

accordance with Section 4 (6) of PD No. 1445; 

 

b) revisit the policies and guidelines to include regular monitoring and strict 
enforcement of the submission of the documents required to be submitted 

by the grantees/scholars, FSPs and COs within the prescribed period; 



41 

 

 

c) revise the existing database to include but not limited to: names of the 
grantee, foreign language availed, name of institution, period of the 

training program, status and the allowances/entitlements granted for each 

grantee/scholar for proper monitoring and future reference; and 

 

d) employ effective monitoring mechanism in order to assess the usefulness 
and application of the foreign language learned by the scholars/grantees. 

 
Management comment: 

 
The FSI submitted to the Audit Team the required ORs for the payment made 

to international training institute on January 22, 2020. On the required PTRs and 
certificate of completion, the said documents are still being gathered from the 
grantees who are currently at foreign posts and regional consular offices. The required 
LRs, RDs, and request for fund transfer are still being prepared by FSPs and have 
committed the submission as soon as completed. 

 
The Institute’s CPRSD acknowledged the lapses in monitoring the submission 

of vital documents related to the implementation of the scholarship programs, and 
committed to rectify and improve the existing process to avert a repeat of lapses in 
its internal control. Further, the FSI committed to endeavor to utilize effective 
monitoring mechanisms to assess the usefulness and application of the foreign 
language learned by the grantees/scholars. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 
The Audit Team was provided with the necessary documents and will monitor 

the status on the implementation of the scholarship programs.
