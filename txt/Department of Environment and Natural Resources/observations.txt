PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



A)	Financial Audit



Unadjusted/uncorrected accounting errors/omissions and accounting deficiencies



1)	We do not express an opinion on the Financial Statements (FSs) due to uncorrected misstatements in an aggregate amount of ₱1,216.924 million, which exceeded the materiality level of ₱306.964 million, and various accounting deficiencies such as non-maintenance of Subsidiary Ledgers and lack of complete accounting records on various FS accounts with an aggregate amount of ₱13,310.877 million, which prevented alternative audit procedures to be undertaken to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to prove the management’s assertions on the accounts, where the possible effect could be material and pervasive.



	Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 provides that “Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position; financial performance, and cash flow of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs.”



Accounting errors and omissions amounting to ₱972.475 million were adjusted/corrected by the Chief Accountant. Details are presented below.

Moreover, the following accounting deficiencies due to non-maintenance/absence of Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs), PPE Ledger Cards (PPELCs), and Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) for receivable and payable accounts and other deficiencies amounting to ₱13,310.877 million were also disclosed in audit. The absence of SLCs, PPELCs and SLs precluded the audit teams to perform appropriate alternative audit procedures to prove the management’s assertions and to establish the actual misstatements affecting the reliability of the accounts balances and disclosures:

13,310.877





The above-mentioned errors/omissions and deficiencies are indications of inadequacies and breakdowns in the internal control systems in the whole of the Department. It, likewise, shows non-compliance by the DENR CO, Bureaus, ROs and PENROs concerned with the systems and procedures prescribed for by the GAM for NGAs, which affect the reliability and the fair presentation of the combined financial statements.



In view of the misstatements that arise from the uncorrected errors/omissions in an aggregate amount of ₱1,216.924 million, which exceeded the materiality level, and accounting deficiencies such as absence of SLs and lack of accounting records affecting various FS accounts with an aggregate amount of ₱13,310.877 million, which prevented alternative audit procedures to be undertaken to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence relating to management’s assertions on the accounts, where the possible effect on the assets, liabilities and accumulated surplus/deficit accounts could be material and pervasive, we do not express an opinion on the Financial Statements.



We reiterated our prior year’s recommendations and DENR Management agreed to require the Chief Accountants of the Central and Regional Offices and the Accountants of the PENROs to:



a)	effect the necessary adjustments on the errors/omissions to correct the balances of the affected accounts in the FS;



b)	reconcile the variances between the SLCs and RPCI for inventory accounts; PPELCs and RPCPPE for PPE accounts; SLs for all Inter-Agency/ Intra-Agency/ Other Receivables, Accounts Payable/ Inter-Agency/ Intra-Agency/ Other Payable accounts with the ageing schedules and confirmation results; and the Financial Accountability Report with the Notes to FS;



c)	trace the details of the dormant accounts/beginning balances and those SLs with negative balances, and prepare adjusting entries, if necessary;



d)	maintain complete and updated accounting records, specifically:



i)	Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs) on each type of Inventories;



ii)	PPE Ledger Cards (PPELs) on each category of Property Plant and Equipment including Construction in Progress Accounts;



iii)	Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs) for Receivables, Payables, Income and Accumulated Surplus/Deficit accounts; and,



e)	ensure that the systems and procedures prescribed for by the GAM for NGAs are observed in the processing and recording of the transactions in the books of accounts in all offices of the DENR, and strengthen the internal control systems in whole of the Department to achieve reliability and fair presentation of the combined financial statements.



	

A)	Compliance with Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements



Overall Fund utilization



2)	Overall, the department’s fund utilization of ₱15,959.601 million is 91.07 percent compared to its appropriation/allotment of ₱17,525.277 million, leaving an overall balance of ₱1,565.676 million at year-end due to the non-implementation of some of the agency’s programs, projects and activities during the year in view of the various community quarantines measures that the government imposed.

	

	The government budget is the financial plan of the agency for a given period, usually for a Fiscal Year (FY), which shows what its resources are, and how they will be generated and used over the fiscal period. The budget is the government’s key instrument for promoting its socio-economic objectives. It also refers to the income, expenditures, and source of borrowings of the National Government (NG) that are used to achieve the national objectives, strategies and programs during the year.

	

	To ensure the fulfilment of the mandates of the various government agencies, the National Budget for FY 2020 was approved through the Republic Act (RA) No. 11465, also known as the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020, which provides in its General Provisions that:



“Section 60. Cash Budgeting System. All appropriations authorized in this Act shall be available for release and disbursement for the purpose specified, and under the same special provisions applicable thereto, until December 31, 2020.”



Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and Balances



The overall Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and Balances (SAAODB) of DENR for FY 2020 showed that out of total allotment of ₱17,525.277 million, ₱15,959.601 million or 91.07 percent were utilized/obligated, leaving an unutilized allotment of ₱1,565.676 million.

The above allotments are inclusive of the two major programs, the Manila Bay Rehabilitation Program (MBRP) and the National Greening Program (NGP), which registered 38.40 percent and 97.47 percent utilization rates, respectively, the Pasig River Rehabilitation Coordination and Management Office (PRCMO), with fund utilization of ₱43.451 million or 53.85 percent of the allotment of ₱80.695 million, a balance of ₱37.245 million, and the two foreign-assisted projects (FAPs), the Forestland Management Project (FMP) and Integrated Natural Resources and Environmental Management Project (INREMP), which likewise, registered 90.01 percent and 84.07 percent utilization rates.



For DENR CO, the MBRP, eNGP, PRCMO and FAPs, contributed much to the unutilized funds. Out of the ₱2,394.085 million CY 2020 allotment of DENR CO and ₱181.111 million for RO IV-B, only ₱1,380.021 million or 57.64 percent and ₱143.225 million or 79.08 percent were utilized, leaving an unobligated balance of ₱1,014.065 million and ₱37.886 million, respectively. The DENR CO and RO IVB shared the bigger pie of the unexpended amount of allotments as of December 31, 2020.

	The low fund utilization of the MBRP was due to the following:

	

a)		Reprogram activities, as reflected in the revised Work and Financial Plan, were requested for modification by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) since it requires a modification of allotment from MOOE to CO. However, the approved Special Allotment Release Order was issued and released by DBM only at a later date of the year (SARO issued & received – January 11, 2021) entailing the rescheduling of activities.

	

b)		Delayed implementation of activities ensuing from Delayed approval of Work and Financial plan due to changes in priority activities in Baywalk, like unfolding/existing conditions on the ground (i.e. newly discovered leaking pipes, use of High-Density PolyEthlene (HDPE) pipes in the major outfalls);

	

c)		Tedious process of MOA preparation between DENR and concerned agencies (DPWH & MMDA) involving various consultation/discussions/meetings before coming into an agreement.



d)		Conduct of planned workshops, principal and alternate’s meeting were not undertaken due to limitations as imposed per IATF guidelines and restrictions on safety protocols.

	

e)		Non-procurement of some supplies & materials due to lack of material time for the procurement process.

	

f)		Conduct of monitoring of Manila Bay activities was restricted in compliance to IATF guidelines and travel restrictions.



National Greening Program (NGP)

	

For FY 2020, it has an appropriation of ₱2,645.324 million, of which ₱2,578.387 million or 97.47 percent was utilized as of year-end, leaving an unobligated allotment of ₱66.937 million, broken down as follows:

	The low fund utilization of the Pasig River Coordination and Management Office (PRCMO) was due to the following:

	

a)		Special Allotment and Release Order (SARO) for the operational requirements of the project was issued by DBM only on April 3, 2020, hence, the first quarter salary of the Contract of Service (COS) personnel and other operational requirements was augmented under Regular Agency Fund. Hiring of additional personnel during the 1st quarter was deferred pending release of the SARO and PRCMO was limited to hiring only essential/frontline COS personnel, thus the allotted budget for “Other Professional Services” was not fully utilized.

	

b)		Bulk of the procurement process started only on June 2020, which was attributable to the delayed approval of the Work and Financial Plan and Project Procurement Plan. Failure in the bidding process and other modes of procurement for programs and projects due to various reasons, such as “no bidders” and “Low Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC)”.

	

c)		Per approved budget, there is an allotted budget of ₱4.210 million for General Services based on the previous allotment of the disestablished PRRC. However, the PRCMO has no Janitorial Expenses and only 50 percent of the budget was obligated for Security Services.

	

d)		Almost all of the planned trainings and meetings were not conducted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and in compliance with the Inter-Agency Task Force.



	Foreign assisted projects- FMP and INREMP

	

The FMP and INREMP showed an overall utilization rate of 90.01 and 84.07 percent, respectively, as of December 31, 2020, shown by expense category in the following table.

Below are the causes of the low utilization of allotments of FMP and INREMP, as follows:



Office

Reasons for low/non-utilization

FMP Central Project Management Office (CPMO)

--	The fund utilization of FMP’s current and continuing appropriation in 2020 totaled ₱23.520 million, which is 61 percent compared to its allotment of ₱38.824 million. The low fund utilization rate resulted from the COVID 19 pandemic restrictions. The project activities such as workshops, meetings and trainings were conducted either thru online-platforms or with reduced number of participants.



--	Also, the annual target for ground validation was not implemented while construction of Agroforestry’s 12 Support Facilities (ASF) were not fully completed as scheduled resulting in backlogs.

INREMP National Project Coordinating Office (NPCO)

--	The fund utilization of INREMP’s current and continuing appropriation in 2020, which totaled ₱97.999 million is 81 percent compared to its allotment of ₱121.111 million.



--	The CY 2020 Annual Progress Report of INREMP disclosed the following reasons for the low fund utilization:



1)	Most of the trainings and workshops were programmed on a face-to-face venue, which includes accommodation, meals, transportation, and travel expenses. Due to the Covid 19 pandemic, most of these activities were conducted virtually with minimal cost incurred resulting in the low obligation rate of the programmed allotment.



2)	Technical monitoring and assessment activities were limited due to travel restrictions in compliance with the Inter-agency Task Force (IATF) guidelines. These activities were also conducted virtually.



3)	Targets for the validation of 2017 and 2018 natural resources management sub-projects were not fully completed due to the travel restrictions implemented during the quarantine period. Some LGUs do not allow outsiders to enter and conduct gatherings within the community.



4)	The programmed allotment in support to Livelihood Enhancements sub-projects of DTI was not fully utilized due to the following:



a)	With the issuance of no objection letters to all sub-project proposals of DTI on the last quarter of the 2019, the preparatory activities for procurement, such as preparation of procurement-related documents in connection with the procurement shared services facility (SSF) equipment and building construction-or-renovation related documents, actual procurement of equipment and construction or renovation works, and submission of first-of-its-kind procurement documents to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) were undertaken only starting December 2019 and spilled over to 2021. There were also delays on the procurement partly due to stringent requirements of ADB, which DTI is not familiar with and, the imposition of ECQ affecting the procurement activities since most suppliers are Manila-Based.



b)	The capacity building, market linkaging and monitoring/assessment activities of DTI were conducted virtually due to restrictions on mass gatherings and face-to-face interactions. Minimal costs were incurred.



c)	The procurement of 4 units of vehicles amounting to ₱7.500 million in support to LES2 implementation started in August 2020. However, no bid offer was received, thus resulting in a failure of the bidding. Upon consultation with ADB, No Objection Letter (NOL) allowing the procurement to be done directly by the regional offices of DTI was only issued by ADB on 18 December 2020. Thus, procurement of DTI per region is ongoing and targeted to be delivered by Q1 2021.





The low fund utilization rate in the DENR CO and RO IVB were attributed to the non-utilization of the allotments received during the year due to the non-implementation of agency’s programs, projects and activities in view of the various community quarantine measures that the government imposed.



Thus, the Department is not fully compliant with the provisions under Section 60 of RA No. 11465, the GAA for FY 2020 on the adoption of the cash budgeting system and DBM National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated January 6, 2020 prescribing the guidelines on the release of funds for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2020.

















We recommended and the Management of DENR agreed to:



a)	cause the full utilization of unobligated allotments for CY 2020 PPAs, which are not yet implemented to realize optimum results and benefits on their completion as timely as intended.



b)	direct the officials responsible for the implementation of programs and projects of the MBRP, ENGP, PRCMO and the two Foreign-Assisted Projects (FAPs), FMP and INREMP to ensure the timely implementation of the programs and projects to avoid non-utilization of allotments released for the above-mentioned programs/projects.

	

Cash utilization/disbursements



3)	Of the ₱18,024.157 million Notice of Cash Allocations (NCAs) received, inclusive of the two major projects, the ENGP and MBRP, the PRCMO and the two Foreign Assisted Projects, FMP and INREMP, ₱16,898.037 million or 93.75 percent were utilized inclusive of payment of Accounts Payable, leaving an overall unutilized NCAs of ₱1,126.119 million or 6.25 percent. Moreover, cash utilizations were low in DENR CO, Regions IV-B and XI and PENROs Ilocos Sur and La Union.



EO No. 91 dated September 9, 2019 requires the adoption of the cash budgeting system effective FY 2019 in order to formulate and implement a National Budget that is supportive of and consistent with the socio-economic development plan, and oriented towards the achievement of explicit objectives and expected results to ensure that funds are utilized and operation are conducted effectively, economically and efficiently.



In view of the said E.O., DBM Circular Letter No. 2019-3 dated January 4, 2019 was issued. It provides that:



“1.0 To ensure the timely implementation of programs and projects, disbursement authorization documents are issued to make cash available within the scheduled program/activity/project implementation period as reflected in the corresponding DBM-evaluated Monthly Disbursement Programs (MDPs) submitted by agencies.



2.0 Relative thereto, the following policies and procedures shall be observed by all concerned beginning the first quarter of 2019: 



2.1 All NCA releases for Regular MDS Sub-Accounts, to be credited for any month, whether part of the comprehensive releases or constituting additional NCA releases, shall continue to be valid until the last working day of the 3rd month of the quarter covered.



xxx



2.3 It is understood that all NCA balances of regular MDS Sub-Accounts at the end of each quarter are considered lapsed after the last working hour of said quarter.”



Overall, the DENR received Notices of Cash Allocations (NCAs) in the total amount of ₱18,024.157 million, ₱16,898.037 million was disbursed or equivalent to 93.75 percent utilization rate inclusive of payment of Accounts Payable, leaving an unutilized amount of ₱1,126.119 million or 6.25 percent in CY 2020. The causes of the lapsing of the notices of cash allocations at the DENR CO, ROs IV-B and XI, and PENROs Ilocos Sur and La Union are herein summarized in the following table.



Office

Reasons for low cash utilization

DENR CO

The lapse of the notices of cash allocations (NCAs) were attributed to the untimely implementation of projects, due to the impositions of enhanced community quarantine measures brought by the Covid 19 pandemic, on the following program/office/project: (1) Enhanced National Greening Program, (2) Manila Bay Rehabilitation Projects, (3) Pasig River Rehabilitation activities and projects, and (4) Foreign-assisted projects, as explained earlier in the fund utilization, which resulted in the low disbursements of funds.

RO IV-B

The lapsed cash allocations were mainly due to the series of community quarantines imposed by the government, which impeded the accomplishments of various activities including, but not limited to, travel to Provincial Environment and Natural Resources (PENR) Offices, conduct of trainings and workshops, and survey activities that needs hiring of laborers.

RO XI

Due to the Covid 19 pandemic, the lapsing of NCAs were attributable to the reduced catering services and incurrence of local travels due to the conduct of virtual meetings in lieu of actual/physical meetings resulting to the cancellation of catering services for the 2nd & 3rd quarters under the Ordering Agreement. Likewise, travels were reduced or restricted due to the imposition of travel requirements for local travels.

PENRO Ilocos Sur

Inadequacy in the preparation and implementation of PENRO Ilocos Sur and La Union’s work and financial plan, which contributed to the delayed implementation of the Agency’s Programs, Activities and Projects resulting in low utilization of cash allocation, which in effect deprived beneficiaries of the possible benefits that can be derived therefrom.

PENRO La Union





Thus, the DENR as a whole is not compliant, with the provisions under DBM Circular Letter (CL) No. 2019-3 dated January 4, 2019 on the efficient utilization of the cash allocations released by the DBM for the agency’s obligations during the year.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Regional Executive Directors/ PENR Officers of:



a)	Regions IV-B and XI to henceforth maximize the utilization of NCAs released to their respective Regional Offices to:





i)		closely supervise and monitor the work of the divisions charged with the implementation of the various activities of the Agency for a timely implementation of the P/A/Ps, as well as the Cashier, Budget and Accounting Sections as the administrative support to operations; and

	

ii)		consider the future impact of the imposition of any community quarantine in the subsequent year’s budget through a realistic estimation and to align the Monthly Cash Program with the new budget estimates to come up with a more realistic forecasting and expenditures programming for an efficient management of the monthly cash allocation.



b)	PENROs Ilocos Sur and La Union to implement the activities, programs and projects as planned to ensure full and timely utilization of cash allocation for its intended purpose and to ensure the delivery of services to beneficiaries in a timely manner.



Non-reversion of dormant cash, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary fund and non-enforcement of regulations on the use of foreshore lands



4)	The DENR FAPs, two Bureaus, eight ROs and 51 PENROs have no dormant cash, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary bank accounts for reversion to the National Treasury. However, the FMB, three ROs and six PENROs did not revert its dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds amounting to ₱23.623 million as of year-end, contrary to Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012, dated September 11, 2012, implementing EO No. 431, dated May 30, 2005. Thus, the government was deprived of the available funds that could be used in its priority programs and projects.



Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012 implementing EO No. 431 dated 30 May 2005 was issued directing the reversion of all dormant accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds to the general fund.

	

Further, COA Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 29, 2015 in conformity with Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012 prescribes the accounting guidelines and procedures in the reversion to the General Fund of all dormant cash balances, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary special and trust funds maintained by national government agencies (NGAs) with depository banks.



The following shall be deposited with the National Treasury and recorded as trust receipts:



	a)		Receipts collected or received by departments, bureaus, offices, and instrumentalities of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs: (i) from non-tax sources, including insurance proceeds; acting as trustee, agent or administrator; (ii) as a guaranty for the fulfilment of an obligation; or (iii) from donations authorized by law or contract for specific purposes with a term not exceeding one (1) year; and

	

	b)		Those classified by law or regulations as trust receipts.



All government offices and agencies are required to immediately transfer all public moneys deposited with depository banks and other institutions to the Bureau of the Treasury regardless of income source.

	

Section 3 of the same PC Joint Circular states that “In case there are unreconciled differences/balances after performing reconciliation procedures required by this Circular due to the absence or lack of underlying records and documents, Head of the Agency shall immediately submit a request for write-off of these unreconciled differences/balances to the COA consistent with Section A.10, COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 5, 1997, supported by the following:

	

a)	List of available records and extent of validation made on the accounts; and

	

b)	Certification and reasons why the books of accounts/records, financial statements/schedules and supporting vouchers/documents cannot be located.”

	

As of December 31, 2020, the DENR FAPs, two Bureaus, eight ROs and 51 PENROs have no dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary bank accounts for reversion to National Treasury, in compliance with the afore-cited regulations.



However, the bank accounts of the FMB, three ROs and six PENROs, with a total cash balance of ₱23.625 million, which are either dormant/inactive/unauthorized, as shown in table below, remained not reverted to the general fund in spite of the directive issued under Permanent Committee JC No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012, implementing EO No. 431 dated May 30, 2005.

	Collections from performance security, bid documents, seminar fees in the total amount of ₱11.094 million in FMB, CAR, Region XIII and four PENROs were deposited in an authorized government depository bank (AGDB) instead of the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr), which is not in line with the directive under Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012.

	

	Moreover, the unauthorized funds of Region XII was previously under Fund 102, which was merged to Fund 101 on December 31, 2007 with an aggregate amount of ₱12.530 million. The underlying cause of the non-reversion of such depository account can be attributed to the improper accounting of the fund during the merging of the accounts. However, alternative audit procedure cannot be undertaken since management was unable to produce the appropriate reports/records pertaining to this depository account.

	

We recommended and Management agreed to require the FMB Bureau Director, Regional Executive Directors of CAR, ROs XII and XIII and six PENR Officers concerned to:

	

a)	close the dormant and/or unauthorized bank accounts and remit the balances, if any, to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr);



b)	revert the account to the general fund and correspondingly deposit the dormant/inactive/unauthorized cash balances to the BTr. In case of trust receipts, deposit the funds with the BTr under the Agency/Treasury Deposit – Trust; and



c)	send confirmation letter to the respective Authorized Government Depository Banks (AGDB) of RO XII and PENRO Cebu to confirm the balance and trace the existence or history of bank accounts in the agency records, and deposit all existing account balances to the BTr.



Non-enforcement of regulations on the use of foreshore lands



5)	Assessed revenues from the use/occupation of foreshore lands amounting to ₱35.123 million were not realized due to lack of collection enforcement and lapses in monitoring the collection efforts by the responsible officials, delayed appraisal of foreshore lease areas, and the absence of approved foreshore lease agreement (FLA), thus, deprived the government of the opportunity to collect such income, which can be used to fund the government’s priority programs and projects.

	

	DENR Administrative Order (DAO) No. 2004-24 dated August 24, 2004 provides for the Revised Rules and Regulations Governing the Administration and Management of Foreshores Lands. It aims to pursue the government’s policy to tap all resources to generate economic opportunities and promote social equity as well as to promote the sustainable use of our country’s foreshore/marshy lands through effective and efficient management schemes and strategies, among others.

	

Section 11 thereof specifically provides that “the terms of Foreshore Lease Agreement (FLA), which shall be for the period of 25 years and renewable for another 25 years at the option of the lessor.”



	Likewise, Section 16 of the aforesaid DAO provides that “non-payment of annual lease rental for two (2) consecutive years shall be a ground for cancellation of FLAs.”

	

	An estimated revenue of ₱35.123 million was not collected in six PENROs due to absence of approved FLA, lack of enforcement of rental collections from patrimonial/foreshore properties/cottages owners and lapses in the monitoring of collection efforts of responsible officials. Details are shown in the following table.

	In PENRO Catanduanes, some of the foreshore occupants that are operating in the province did not pay in full the annual estimated occupation fee because most of these businesses are currently not operating and therefore, not generating income due to the pandemic situation.

	

For PENRO Capiz, the inability of the PENRO Management to expedite the updating of database of foreshore areas and to require occupants of foreshore lands to apply and enter into FLAs with PENRO Capiz deprived the government of revenues from application and rental fees estimated at ₱2 million and ₱35 million, respectively, since CY 2005.



	On the other hand, the PFMDP for the Province of Zamboanga del Sur which was not yet presented to the LGU for approval aims to address the problem in the issuance of appropriate tenurial instruments and collection of revenues.

	

	Likewise, Davao de Oro did not closely monitor its rental collectibles from lease of foreshore lands. They only knew that the lessor had already retired/closed her business and defaulted payments only upon receipt of the previously issued AOM and the reply from the lessor in 2016.

	

	Thus, the lack of collection strategies or collection enforcement to compel the lessees to settle their respective accounts, ineffective monitoring system/mechanism on uncollected rentals by responsible officials; and the failure to conduct updated inventory of foreshore lands with occupants/settlers without FLAs/MOAs resulted in opportunity loss on the part of the government.  This very low collection rate deprived the government of the needed financial resources for its priority programs/projects.

	

	We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Regional Executive Directors and PNR Officers concerned of:

	

a)	the six PENROs to sustain their efforts/strategies to:

	

i)	optimize collections from foreshore lease and occupation fees such as sending bills and demand letters monthly/regularly; and

	

ii)	develop effective strategies/mechanism/ processes for an effective monitoring to ensure   enforcement of DENR AO 2004-24 dated August 24, 2004 and other existing laws and guidelines on the use of foreshore lands;

	

b)	PENROs Capiz and Misamis Occidental to facilitate the approval of the Foreshore Lease Agreement; and

		

c)			PENRO Davao Oriental and Davao de Oro to intensify the conduct of inventory/survey of foreshore lands to facilitate processing of pending FLAs and identify unauthorized occupants/settlers.



Non-liquidation of cash advances



6)	Cash advances during the year for payroll, operating expenses, official local and foreign travels and special purpose/time-bound undertakings amounting to ₱129.721 million in two staff bureaus, ten ROs, and 41 PENROs were liquidated in accordance with COA Circular No. 97-002. However, cash advances amounting to ₱27.770 million or 8.96 percent of the cash advances granted during the year of ₱309.757 million were not liquidated in the DENR-CO, FAPs, two staff bureaus, three ROs and 15 PENROs at year-end. Also, there were still unliquidated cash advances in prior years amounting to ₱6.573 million or 19.63 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱33.488 million, thus, exposes government funds to possible misuse.



Items 4.0 and 4. 1 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 19tre97 provides the following rules and regulations on the granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances:

	

a)		No additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.

	

b)		A cash shall be reported on as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served.

	

c)		Only duly appointed or designated disbursing officers may perform disbursing functions.

	

d)		Transfer of cash advance from one Accountable Officer (AO) to another shall not be allowed.

	

e)		The cash advance shall be used solely for the specific legal purpose for which it was granted

	

	Section 1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 states that “The accountable officer shall liquidate cash advance for special purpose as soon as the purpose of the cash advance has been served.”

	

		Cash advances during the year for payroll, operating expenses, official local and foreign travels and special purpose/time-bound undertakings amounting to ₱129.721 million in FMB, BMB, ten ROs, and 41 PENROs were liquidated in accordance with COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. There were also no unliquidated cash advances in prior years.

	

	On the other hand, cash advances amounting to ₱27.770 million or 8.96 percent of the cash advances granted during the year of ₱309.757 million were not liquidated in the DENR-CO, FAPs, two staff bureaus, three ROs and 15 PENROs at year-end. Also, there were still unliquidated cash advances in prior years amounting to ₱6.573 million or 19.63 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱33.488 million, aging over ten years.

The following are the causes of the accumulation of unliquidated cash advances:            (a) additional cash advances were granted to the Accountable Officer even if previous cash advances were not yet settled or liquidated; (b) liquidation and refund of cash advances were delayed and/or not enforced; and (c) practice of transferring of cash advances to other employees who are neither bonded nor designated to act as disbursing officers.



Moreover, the remaining prior years unliquidated cash advances were due to the following: (a) case filed with the Ombudsman on subject CA; (b) the accountable officers concerned were no longer connected with the DENR, resigned or absconded; and c) outstanding CA from FAPs that were transferred to regular agency fund (Fund 101) upon closure of the projects but without complete details and no available record to support the validity of the balances.



Thus, the two staff bureaus, ten ROs, and 41 PENROs are not compliant with the provisions of COA Circular No. 97-02 as regards the procedures in the grant and liquidations of cash advances.



We recommended and Management agreed to:



		a)	direct the Accounting Units to:



		i)		refrain from processing additional cash advance of accountable officers with outstanding cash advance/s;

	

		ii)		validate the propriety of the long outstanding balances and request for write off for those balances existing for over ten years; and



		iii)		establish the breakdown of the Prior Year Cash Advances to Officer and Employees that are recorded in the books in the lump sum amount.



		b)	stop the practice of transferring of cash advances from one officer to another who are neither bonded nor designated to act as disbursing officers;



		c)	strictly enforce the period of liquidation of CA within prescribed period by requiring the accountable officers to immediately liquidate their cash advances as soon as the purpose for which it was granted has already been served;



		d)	demand from the accountable officers the immediate liquidation of the unliquidated balances of cash advances and the immediate refund/return of any excess amount thereof; and



Non-liquidation of fund transfers to Implementing Agencies (IAs) and NGOs/POs



7)	Fund transfers to NGAs, LGUs, GOCCs and NGOs/POs for the implementation of agency’s projects amounting to ₱252.896 million or 69.37 percent of the funds transferred during the year amounting to ₱364.571 million were not liquidated, contrary to Circular No. 94-013 and COA Circular No. 2007-001. Also, there were still unliquidated fund transfers in prior years amounting to ₱2.411 billion or 87 percent of prior year’s balance of ₱2.772 million.



Section 5.4 provides that “the SA shall require the IA to submit the reports and furnish the IA with a copy of the journal voucher taking up the expenditures.



Item No. 5.4 of COA Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007 requires “that within sixty (60) days after the completion of the project, the NGO/PO shall submit the Final Utilization Report certified by its Accountant and approved by its President/Chairman to the Government Organization (GO), together with the inspection report and certificate of project completion rendered/issued by the GO authorized representative, list of beneficiaries with their acceptance/acknowledgement of the project/funds/goods/services received. These documents shall support the liquidation of funds granted to the NGO/PO.”



The balances of fund transfers to implementing agencies and NGOs/POs amounted to ₱252.896 million and ₱2,411.499 million for the current and prior years, respectively, as presented in the table below:

The non-liquidation of a substantial amount of fund transfers to IAs and NGOs/POs was due to the failure of Management of DENR CO, Bureaus, ROs and PENROs to monitor the status of fund transfers at the time it was due for liquidations. If only the agency had established mechanism/strategies that would compel the IAs to immediately submit liquidation reports when due, the unliquidated balance of the accounts would have been reduced.

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Chief Accountants of DENR CO and ROs and the Accountants of Bureaus and PENROs to:



a)	closely monitor the implementation of projects and the status of fund transfers, and enforce the liquidation right after the completion of the projects; and



b)	send demand letters to IAs and NGOs/POs with unliquidated fund transfers.



Advances to PS-DBM and PITC



8)	Delayed/non-delivery of items procured from the Procurement Service-DBM (PS-DBM) and the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC) resulted in the accumulated balance of fund transfers amounting to ₱1,309.418 million and ₱121.917 million, respectively.



Executive Order No. 359 dated June 2, 1989 provides that “the Procurement Service (PS) of the Department of Budget and Management xxx shall be maintained as the regular organizational unit to implement and operate a central procurement system.” 



Section 4 (b) thereof further provides that “agencies shall remit to the Procurement Service the funds needed to service their requirements for supplies, materials and equipment as reflected in the Work and Financial Plan.”



Implementing Guidelines on Agency-to-Agency Agreements Negotiated Procurement under Section 53 (e) of IRR-A:



--	Paragraph 1.0



“It is the general policy of government to purchase its requirements from the private sector.  However, it acknowledges that, in some exceptional cases, procurement from another agency of the government is more efficient and economical for the government, subject to the following conditions:”



--	Paragraph 5.0



“The Procuring Entity shall justify that entering into an Agency-to-Agency Agreement with the Servicing Agency is more efficient and economical to the government;



i)	Servicing Agency has the mandate to deliver the goods and services required to be procured or to undertake the infrastructure project or consultancy required by the Procuring Agency;”



Section V.D.5(a-b) of Annex “H” Re: Consolidated Guidelines for the Alternative Methods of Procurement of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9184-Government Procurement Reform Act:



“Procurement from another agency of the government (i.e., Servicing Agency) that has the mandate to deliver goods or services or to undertake infrastructure projects or consultancy services as required by the Procuring Entity (Annex H. item V.D.5)”



Section 5, PD 1071 (REVISING THE CHARTER OF THE PHILIPPINE INTERNATIONAL TRADING CORPORATION) states the purposes of the PITC:



“To engage in or handle for Philippine and third country enterprises through methods, systems, devices and facilities intended to achieve economies of scale and better terms of trade for Philippine business, both foreign procurement as well as foreign marketing and distribution; in general, to undertake such activities as would be appropriate to an institution created for the purposes of international trading.”

It was observed in audit that the procurement of the infrastructure and land improvement projects by the DENR CO with the PITC is not within the function of the Agency. These projects can be properly implemented through an Agency-to-Agency agreement with the Department of Public Works and Highways, a proper agency to implement projects or the DENR itself to implement these projects either through contract or by administration, as authorized in RA No. 9184:

Moreover, as to funds transferred by DENR Region I to PITC in CY 2018 for the procurement of various Motor Vehicles, three (3) Motor Vehicles were delivered during the year but liquidation was not yet taken up in the books of the DENR RO I due to failure of the Property Officer to submit the delivery receipts, inspection report and other documents to the Accounting Unit as basis for the recording of the items delivered in the books.



In the case of LMB, of the total amount of ₱19.642 million, ₱18.524 million was returned to the BTr since this fund remained unutilized for four years and the procurement of two elevator units can no longer be undertaken since the building, where the elevators were supposed to be installed, was gutted by fire in May 2018. While the amount of ₱1.118 million was used to procure vehicle, which was delivered in CY 2020.



Likewise, the non-delivery/delayed delivery of the common-used supplies requested from the DBM-PS and the non-implementation of the infrastructure projects requested from the PITC were due to the lack of coordination and proper follow-up by concerned agency officials, and the absence of reconciliation between the DENR and the PS/PITC records, which resulted in the non-liquidation of the fund transfers and the balance remained outstanding in the books for more than a year.



The non-availability of the needed supplies and equipment as these are needed affects the operating performance of the DENR in terms of the achievement of its mandate.

	

This has been an audit observation in the prior years and we deemed it important to reiterate these observations since implementation of the audit recommendations during the year was only 52.35 percent and 3.10 percent for the current and prior years’ fund transfers, respectively.



We reiterated our recommendation and Management agreed to:



a)	make representation with the PS-DBM and PITC to request for the immediate delivery of the undelivered supplies, equipment and services covered by the advances made by the DENR or require them to return the cost of all undelivered supplies, if said supplies and materials are no longer be needed by the Agency due to the lapse of time; and



b)	stop the practice of procuring infrastructure and land improvement projects with the PITC instead enter into an agency-to-agency agreement with the DPWH or to implement the projects, either by administration or by contract, in accordance with the provisions in RA No. 9184.

	

Dormant receivable not requested for write-off



9)	Dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers amounting to ₱30.949 million were not requested for write-off, as allowed under Section 8.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, thus, casting doubt to their validity and existence.



Item 6.1 and 6.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 provides that “All government entities shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis of receivable accounts to ensure that these are collected when these become due and demandable and that cash advances and fund transfers are liquidated within the prescribed period depending upon the nature and purpose” and “shall prepare the schedule of all receivables, unliquidated cash advances and fund transfers as of December 31, 2015 and quarterly thereafter.”



Section 8 of the same Circular provides for the procedures in the write-off of dormant accounts as follows:



	8.2 	The Head of the government entity shall file the request for authority to write off dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers to the COA Audit Team Leader (ATL) and/or Supervising Auditor (SA). No filing fee is required.



8.3	The request shall be supported by the following documents:



a)	Schedule of dormant accounts by accountable officer/debtor/government entity and by account, certified by the accountant and approved by the Head of the Agency



b)	Certified relevant documents validating the existence of the conditions, as applicable



8.7	For amounts exceeding ₱100,000.00 per accountable officer/debtor/government entity and by account, the A TL and SA shall forward the entire records of the requests to the CD/RD, together with their comments and recommendations, within 15 working days from receipt thereof.





8.11	For amounts exceeding ₱1,000,000.00 per accountable officer/debtor/government entity and by account, the CD/RD shall forward the entire records of the requests together with his/her recommendation to the AC of the Sector within 15 working days from receipt thereof.



The overall unliquidated receivable accounts, cash advances and fund transfer, which became dormant since they are non-moving for 10 years and more amounted to ₱30.949 million but no requests for write-off were filed to the proper approving authority, as provided for in item 8.2 of COA Circular No. 2016-005.

It is also noteworthy to mention that the write-off of dormant accounts is just the process of derecognizing the asset accounts and the corresponding allowance for impairment from the books of accounts and transferring the same to the Registry of Accounts Written-off (RAWO). This does not mean condoning/extinguishing the obligation of the accountable officer/debtor.



We recommended and the Management agreed to direct the Director of the Financial and Management Services, Bureau and Regional Directors to require their respective Department and Regional Chief Accountants, Bureaus and PENROs Accountants to:



	a)	analyze the account balances regularly;



	b)	send demand letters when account becomes due for liquidation; and



	c)	consequently, request for authority to write-off dormant cash advances, fund transfers and receivable accounts after complying with the documentary requirements and conditions set forth in COA Circular no. 2016-005.

Non-insurance of physical assets with the GSIS



10)	The DENR-CO, four Staff Bureaus, two FAPs, eight ROs and 44 PENROs insured with the GSIS physical assets amounting to ₱3,630.528 million with corresponding insurance premiums paid in the amount of ₱46.818 million, in accordance RA No. 656, otherwise known as the “Property Insurance Law” as amended by Presidential Decree (PD) No. 245 dated July 13, 1973. However, some physical assets of three staff Bureau, two FAPs, five ROs, and 21 PENROs in the total amount of ₱879.123 million were not insured against fire or theft with the General Insurance Fund (GIF) of the GSIS, thus, said Offices are at risk of not being indemnified in case of damage or loss of the assets.



Section 5 of RA No. 656 provides that: Every government, is hereby required to insure its properties, with the Fund against any insurable risk herein provided and pay the premiums thereon, which, however, shall not exceed the premiums charged by private insurance companies: Provided, however, That the System reserves the right to disapprove the whole or a portion of the amount of insurance applied for: Provided, further, That such property or part thereof as may not be insurable or acceptable for insurance may be insured with any private insurance company.



Section 11 of the same RA provides that: Each government as defined herein shall include in its annual appropriation the amount necessary to cover the premiums for the insurance of its properties during each fiscal period and remit the same immediately to the System as provided in section ten hereof.



For CY 2020, the DENR-CO, four Staff Bureaus, two FAPs, eight ROs and 44 PENROs insured with the GSIS physical assets amounting to ₱3,624.528 million with corresponding insurance premiums paid of ₱46.818 million, pursuant to RA No. 656, otherwise known as the “Property Insurance Law” as amended by PD No. 245, as presented in the table below.

Although the agency had allotted budget to cover the insurance premiums for the main office buildings and vehicles, no budget was allotted for the insurance coverage of field sub-stations and other Property, Plant and Equipment that were supposed to be covered with insurance policy.



Thus, the non-insurance of the physical assets amounting ₱879.123 million denies the Offices concerned of adequate and reliable protection against any damage to, or loss of the property due to fire, earthquake and other risks from forces of nature.

	

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Heads of the Offices concerned to provide the necessary budget for the insurance premium sufficient to cover all insurable property and cause the application for insurance thereof in faithful compliance with Sections 5 and 11 of RA No. 656.

Unserviceable property, serviceable and confiscated property



Non-disposal of unserviceable property



11)	DENR CO, ERDB, three ROs and eight PENROs have disposed their unserviceable property costing ₱7.509 million during the year while four ROs and 20 PENROs have no unserviceable property as of year-end. However, unserviceable property with a gross value of ₱47.044 million stationed in the DENR CO, three staff Bureaus, two FAPs, three ROs and 25 PENROs remained not disposed of, contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 1445, thus, exposing them to further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value.

	

Section 79 of PD 1445 provides that “When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or is no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the Commission, advertising by printed notice in the Official Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of general circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the expense of publication, by notices posted for a like period in at least three public places in the locality where the property is to be sold. In the event that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned and approved by the Commission.” 



As of year-end, the DENR CO, three ROs and eight PENROs have disposed of their unserviceable property with the total costs of ₱7.509 million, in compliance with Section 79 of PD No. 1445, while four ROs and 20 PENROs have no unserviceable property during the year.



However, there are property found to be unserviceable in the total amount of ₱47.044 million in the CO, FAPs, three staff Bureaus, three ROs, and 25 PENROs, which were not disposed of as of year-end due to the delayed appraisal by the inventory and appraisal committee. This was attributed to the limited physical working condition during the imposition of the enhanced community quarantine measures. Details as follows:

Thus, the non-disposal of unserviceable property due to delayed appraisal, is a non-compliance to Section 79 of PD 1445, and likewise, an indication of weaknesses in internal controls in terms of property management, thus, exposing said property to further deterioration and decreasing their realizable value.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Heads of the Offices concerned to take immediate action to facilitate/cause the appraisal and disposal of unserviceable property to avoid further deterioration and optimize realizable value therefrom.

	

Improper handling, custody and delayed disposition of confiscated forest products and conveyances

	

12)	The absence of a clear cut policy in the management of the Confiscated/Abandoned/Seized Goods Inventory (CASGI) on confiscated forest products, conveyances, tools and equipment resulted in the inadequate implementation of confiscated products costing ₱46.563 million in DENR CO and 16 PENROs and undetermined losses to the government due to improper handling and custody of said confiscated assets, which exposes the assets to the risk of loss due to some custodial lapses while awaiting final disposition. Moreover, confiscated equipment amounting to ₱56.800 million were left idle due to lack of dispositive plan, which resulted in wastage of resources.

Section 2 of PD No. 1445 states that “it is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.”

Section 102 thereof provides that “the head of any agency of the government is immediately and primarily responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency.  Persons entrusted with the possession or custody of the funds or property under the agency head shall be immediately responsible to him, without prejudice to the liability of either party to the government.”

Further, Section 459 of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM), Volume I require that all supplies or equipment confiscated by any bureau or office for violation of laws or regulations and the title to which has already been acquired by virtue of the decision of the courts or other competent authorities, are considered government property. The government agencies concerned shall submit to the COA Chairman a monthly report of all goods and property acquired by them through confiscation, attachment, forfeiture or donation.

Confiscated property/assets amounting to ₱46.563 million held by DENR CO and 15 PENROs were left deteriorating and idle after these had been seized as follows:

Negros Occidental

--	The absence of a clear-cut policy in the management of the Confiscated/Abandoned/Seized Goods Inventory (CASGI) (confiscated forest products, conveyances, tools and equipment) and weak implementation of the rules and regulations on management of confiscated products resulted in undetermined losses to the government due to unaccounted assets and exposure of the same to risk while awaiting final disposition.

16.01

Catanduanes

--	Non-disposal of prior year’s Confiscated Conveyances exposed them to further deterioration and decreased their realizable value, contrary to Section 79 of the PD No. 1445, thus, the government stand to lose approximately the same amount.

Moreover, confiscated equipment amounting to ₱56.800 million were not disposed of and left idle due to lack of dispositive plan, which resulted in opportunity loss to the government.



Thus, despite the effort of the DENR in enforcing the law on anti-illegal logging, it was remiss in the management of Confiscated/Seized Goods because the pieces of evidence on anti-illegal logging operations were not safeguarded, thus, exposing these assets to the risk of loss through theft or deterioration while awaiting final disposition.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the concerned personnel of DENR CO and concerned Regional Executive Directors and PENR Officers of the 16 PENROs to:



a)	issue an order directing the personnel in-charge to ensure that proper care and storage are provided for the confiscated property to preserve their economic values for the government to obtain optimum benefits therefrom;



b)	in coordination with the Director for Finance, propose budget for capital outlay and/or realign budget from MOOE for the construction of safety storage of confiscated assets; and,



c)	Conduct periodic physical count of seized property.



We further recommended and Management agreed to consider issuing supplemental guidelines and procedures over confiscation/seizure of illegally cut forest products in such a way that it clearly defines the responsible person, its responsibility in the custody of the seized products/property and accountability over confiscated assets, and identify measures that would facilitate the speedy disposal of seized property.



Idle/unused government property and equipment under the responsibility of the DENR Field Offices



13)	Property and equipment costing ₱55.595 remained idle/unused due to various reasons, thus defeats the very purpose for which such assets were purchased/constructed.



	Section 2 of PD 1445 provides that “It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care that such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.”

The RFID Door Lock System of DENR NCR amounting to ₱0.215 million was installed in the 2nd floor of the NEC Building to restrict the access of non-employees of the Regional Office.



The technical and scientific equipment in PENROs Aklan amounting to ₱23.463 million and ₱19.476 million respectively, were received in 2019 and still under the custody of the Property Officer since the specific personnel/office to whom these will be issued were not yet identified by the Management.  Consequently, in case of improper or unauthorized use or misapplication thereof, or losses, damages, or deterioration occasioned by negligence in the keeping or use of the equipment, the Property Officer shall be held liable for its money value.



For the Boracay Inter-Agency Task Force (BIATF), they are still on the process of finalizing the MOA with the LGU of Malay to ensure that someone will be responsible for the proper maintenance and safeguard of the Floating pontoon together with its accessories costing ₱19.476 million in accordance with the Boracay Island rehabilitation program.



In the case of PENRO Kalinga, guard fences costing ₱0.196 million is primarily constructed to provide protection to the installed watershed instruments from outside disturbance and could help prolong the usage of these devices. However, the watershed instruments were not yet installed inside the guard fences. These should have been installed along with the installation of the guard fences, had the regional personnel task in monitoring the project reminded the agency head of putting up the needed devices.



Moreover, the office building of CENRO New Corella, Province of Davao Del Norte costing ₱4.998 million has not yet been utilized in accordance with its purpose since its completion in March 2017, due to the lack of necessary enhancements. Subsequently, building improvements costing ₱1.598 million was proposed, thereby summing up the total building costs to ₱6.596 million.



The Mechanized and Modernized Forest Nursery (MMFN) Equipment procured by the DENR CO on July 21, 2015 amounting to ₱7.248 million and transferred to DENR RO XII in August 2015 were left unutilized pending its installation, thereby exposing this property to deterioration and leading to wastage of government resources. Since the equipment has a five-year useful life, at this point, it has already covered 100% of its useful life. To date, the equipment is yet to be installed. The transfer and installation were stalled by the delayed completion of the construction of the MMFN which will house it. Finally, when the Nursery was completed in CY 2020, restrictions to travel due to the pandemic made it difficult for the suppliers to travel for the purpose 



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the concerned Regional Executive Directors and PENR Officers of:



							a)	PENRO Aklan to:



i)	identify the recipients/end-users of the six units LCD projectors, 25 units laptops, two units large format printers, five units drones, six units underwater cameras, 11 units GPSs, and four units RTK total stations procured in CYs 2019 and 2020 and issue the equipment immediately to them; and



ii)	turnover the custody of the floating pontoon together with its accessories and anchorage to the LGU of Malay either by donation or thru usufruct agreement so that the property shall be properly maintained and safeguarded;



							b)	PENRO Kalinga to fast track the installation of science base watershed instruments;



							c)	PENRO Davao del Norte to expedite the utilization of the building constructed for DENR-CENRO New Corella to ensure that government’s scarce resources are fully maximized, thereby realizing the purpose for which said Agency’s project was implemented; and



							d)	Region XII to contact the supplier as soon as possible to schedule the assessment and repair of the equipment and for them to conduct hands-on trainings on the uses, applications and operations of the equipment.

14)	ERDB, three ROs and 15 PENROs submitted on time 3,717 government contracts and 3,359 purchase orders amounting to ₱829,069 million and ₱266.854 million, respectively. However, 2,606 government contracts and 2,720 purchase orders amounting to ₱547.265 million and ₱123.107 million, respectively, were not submitted by the DENR CO, three staff bureaus, four ROs and 21 PENROs within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from one to 183 days while 725 contracts were not submitted to COA for review, as required under COA Circular No. 2009-001. Hence, precluding the timely review and evaluation of the contract documents, such that any defects could not be rectified immediately.

The delayed submission of contracts and purchase orders (POs) and its supporting documents, due to some lapses on the part of the personnel responsible for the task coupled with the limited physical work condition during the imposition of enhanced community quarantine measures, precluded the timely review and evaluation of the subject contracts and POs, hence, deficiencies if any could not be immediately rectified.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Heads of Offices concerned to submit copies of perfected contracts and POs with all documents forming part thereof to the audit teams concerned within five (5) days from execution/issuance prescribed in COA Circular No. 2009-01 to enable the timely review and evaluation of these contracts as well as the POs issued.



	Proper withholding and timely remittance of GSIS contributions and loans

	

15)	The DENR CO, two staff Bureaus, 10 ROs and 54 PENROs deducted properly and remitted without delay to the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) the personal share and loans of employees amounting to ₱488.105 million and ₱314.546 million, respectively, in accordance with RA No. 8291, the GSIS Act of 1997.  Likewise, the employer’s share amounting to ₱147.221 million was remitted without delay. However, there are prior years’ balances that are subject for reconciliation and remittance amounting to ₱3.823 million in two Staff Bureaus, four ROs and ten PENROs.

	

Section 13 of the IRR of RA No. 8291 states that “it shall be compulsory upon the government agency to deduct from the fixed monthly compensation the personal share of the members and to promptly remit the same to GSIS.”



Moreover, Sections 14.2 and 14.3 of the same IRR provides that the government agency shall also deduct from the fixed monthly compensation of the employee the loan amortizations (consolidated loans, policy loan, emergency loan, housing loan, and other loans), premium payments (optional, pre-need and other non-life insurance) and other amounts due the GSIS.  The said amounts shall be remitted to the GSIS within the first ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month when the deductions were effected, accompanied by supporting lists in the form prescribed by the GSIS.

	

Effective January 1, 2003, the rate of contribution payable by the member and government agency shall be 9% and 12%, respectively, based on the actual monthly salary of the member.



The DENR CO, two staff Bureaus, 10 ROs and 54 PENROs deducted properly and remitted without delay to the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) the personal share and loans of employees amounting to ₱488,105 million and ₱314.546, respectively, in accordance with RA No. 8291, the GSIS Act of 1997, as follows:

The Due to GSIS account, however, showed an ending balance amounting to ₱0.303 million, which represent amounts withheld for employees’ contributions and loan amortizations during the prior years. Said amount remained unremitted to the GSIS due to absence of details of the accounts brought about by the non-maintenance of SLs and related records in the prior years while the GL balance was carried over to the current year. Such that the name of payees and amount cannot be established, therefore, remittance cannot be made possible.

The non-maintenance of SLs for each type of deductions and per employee resulted in difficulty to determine the details of the account balance, therefore, remittance cannot be made possible without the name of employees to whom the remittance will be made as well as the amount to be remitted.



Thus, the above-mentioned offices are not compliant, with the provisions under Section 13 and Section 14 of the IRR of RA 8291 due to the existence of unremitted withheld amounts in the previous years, which are carried over in the current year.



Nonetheless, we recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountants of concerned DENR offices to determine the composition of the prior years’ unremitted balance of the Due to GSIS account and immediately remit the same to the GSIS in compliance with R.A. No. 8291 and/or prepare adjusting journal entries, if necessary.



Withholding and remittance of PhilHealth contributions and employer’s share

	

16)	The DENR CO, two staff Bureaus, 11 ROs and 68 PENROs deducted properly and remitted without delay the PhilHealth personal share of employees amounting to ₱60.786 million in accordance with RA No. 7875, as amended by RA No. 9241 (National Health Insurance Act of 1995). However, there are prior years’ balances, that are subject for reconciliation and remittance amounting to ₱0.408 million in two Staff Bureaus, Region VI and two PENROs.





Section 18 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 7875 as amended by R.A. No. 9241 states:

	

a)	The member’s monthly contribution shall be deducted and withheld automatically by the employer from the former’s salary, wage or earnings. The premium contributed shall be divided equally between the employer and the employed. The employer’s counterpart shall not, in any manner be charged to the employee.



b)	The monthly premium contribution of employed members shall be remitted by the employer on or before the date prescribed by the Corporation.



c)	The remittance of premium contribution by the employer shall be supported by a Remittance List to be submitted regularly to the Corporation.



d)	The failure of the employer to remit the required contribution and to submit the required remittance list shall make the employer liable for reimbursement of payment of a properly filed claim in case the concerned employee or dependent/s avails of Program benefits, without prejudice to the imposition of other penalties as provided for in this Rules.

The DENR CO, two staff Bureaus, 11 ROs and 68 PENROs deducted properly and remitted without delay the PhilHealth personal share of employees amounting to ₱60.786 million in accordance with RA No. 7875, as amended by RA No. 9241 (National Health Insurance Act of 1995).

However, there are prior years’ unremitted balances that have no details and are subject for reconciliation amounting to ₱0.408 million in two Bureaus, RO VI and two PENROs:

The non-remittance of the prior years’ balances was due to the failure of the Accounting Unit to monitor and keep track of the withheld and remitted amounts of the Due to PhilHealth. Likewise, the absence of subsidiary ledgers were among the identified causes of the non-remittance of withheld amount for PhilHealth premiums in the prior years.



Thus, the above offices failed to comply with the full remittance to the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation of the withheld premium contributions of its personnel, in violation of R.A. No. 7875, as Amended by R.A. No. 9241.



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant of the concerned Offices to:



a)	immediately reconcile the prior years’ unremitted amount of the premium contribution of its employees with the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, in compliance with R.A. No. 7875 as Amended by R.A. No. 9241, and remit the same, if necessary; and



b)	regularly monitor and keep track of the withheld and remitted amounts to PhilHealth.



Proper withholding and timely remittance of Pag-IBIG contributions and loans

	

17)	The DENR CO, two staff Bureaus, 11 ROs and 64 PENROs observed proper deductions and timely remittances of the Pag-IBIG personal share and loans of employees amounting to ₱100.325 million and ₱108.565 million, respectively, in accordance with RA No. 7875, as amended by RA No. 9679. However, there are prior years’ balances, that are subject for reconciliation and remittance amounting to ₱1.439 million in the two staff Bureaus, three ROs and three PENROs.



Section 3, Rule VII of IRR of RA No. 9679 provides the following:



a)	“All employers shall remit to the Home Development Mutual Fund, otherwise known as Pag-IBIG Fund their contributions and the contributions of their covered employees as well as the latter’s loan amortizations or payments to the Pag-IBIG Fund, as provided for under Section 2 of this Rule, when applicable, within (15) days from the date the same were collected unless another period is previously agreed upon between the employer and the Fund, or with within such period as the Fund may prescribe otherwise. The Pag-IBIG Fund may prescribe a different remittance schedule for Filipinos employed by foreign based employers depending on the nature of their contract’s tor manner of their deployment abroad.



b)	Every employer required to set aside and remit such contributions as prescribed under R.A. No. 9679 and these Rules shall be liable for their payment, and non-payment thereof shall further subject the employer to a penalty of three percent (3%) per month of the amounts payable from the date the contributions fall due until paid. Every employer who actually deducts from the salary of his employee the latter’s loan amortization or payments to the Pag-IBIG Fund, as provided for under these Rules, shall be liable to their payment, and non-payment thereof shall likewise further subject the employer to a penalty of three percent (3%) per month of the amounts payable from the date of loan amortizations or payments fall due until paid.”





The DENR CO, two staff Bureaus, 11 ROs and 64 PENROs observed proper deductions and timely remittances of the Pag-IBIG personal share and loans of employees amounting to ₱100.325 million and ₱108.565 million, respectively, in accordance with RA No. 7875, as amended by RA No. 9679.



However, the ending balance of the Due to Pag-IBIG account amounting to ₱1,439 million which represents amounts withheld for employees’ contributions and loan amortizations in two staff Bureaus, three ROs, and three PENROs during the prior years, remained unremitted to the Pag-IBIG Fund as shown in Table below:

Notwithstanding the fact that the Accounting Unit properly withheld the personal shares and loan amortizations and remitted to the Pag-IBIG Fund for CY 2020, it failed to reconcile the balance of Due to Pag-IBIG account in the prior years, thereby resulting in an unremitted balance of the account amounting to ₱1,438,973.77.



Thus, the above-mentioned offices are not compliant, with the provisions under Section 3, Rule VII of IRR of RA No. 9679 due to the existence of unremitted withheld amounts in the previous years.



However, in view of the insignificance of the matter earlier discussed, the DENR as a whole is compliant, in all material respects, with the provisions under Section 3, Rule VII of IRR of RA No. 9679, as regards the withholding and remittance of Pag-ibig personal and government shares and loan amortizations of employees during the year.



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant to determine the composition of the unremitted balance pertaining to prior years of the Due to Pag-IBIG account and immediately remit the same to the Pag-IBIG in compliance with R.A. No. 9679 and make the necessary adjusting entries, if necessary.



Proper withholding and timely remittance of taxes

	

18)	The DENR CO, two staff Bureaus, 12 ROs and 55 PENROs properly withheld and remitted without delay the taxes on gross compensation income from officials and employees and government purchases and contract of services from suppliers/contractors amounting to ₱364.959 million and ₱218.186 million, respectively, in accordance with Revenue Regulation No. 10-2008 dated July 8, 2008. However, there are unreconciled balances, unequal withholding and remittances and delay or non-remittance of withholding taxes amounting to ₱11.247 million in two staff Bureaus, three ROs and three PENROs.

	

Revenue Regulation No. 10-2008 dated July 8, 2008 requires “all government agencies to withhold taxes from employees’ earning from compensation, suppliers’ income on contracts and to remit the taxes withheld within 10th day of the following month to the account of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). Agencies are also obliged to submit the Tax Remittance Advice (TRA) on payments withheld from agency appropriations. Accountants are obliged to see to it that all withheld taxes are adjusted to actual taxes due, remitted, and recorded in the books of accounts during the year.”

	

Section 5(a) of BIR Revenue Regulation No. 17-2003 dated March 31, 2003, amending Revenue Regulation No. 2-98 dated April 17, 1998, provides:



“For both large and non-large taxpayers, the withholding tax return, whether credible or final (including final withholding taxes on interest from any currency bank deposit and yield or any other monetary benefit from deposit substitutes shall be filed and payments should be made, within ten (10) days after the end of each month except for taxes withheld for the month of December each year, which shall be filed on or before January 15 of the following year...”



Further, Section 251 of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, states that: 



“Failure of a Withholding Agent to Collect and Remit Tax shall, in addition to other penalties provided for under this Chapter, be liable upon conviction to a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax not withheld, or not accounted for and remitted”.



The DENR CO, two staff Bureaus, 12 ROs and 55 PENROs properly withheld and remitted without delay taxes on gross compensation income from officials and employees and government purchases and contract of services from suppliers/contractors amounting to ₱364.959 million and ₱218.186 million, respectively, in accordance with Revenue Regulation No. 10-2008 dated July 8, 2008.



	However, two staff Bureaus, three ROs and three PENROs with unreconciled balances, unequal withholding and remittances pertaining to the prior years, and/or unremitted withholding taxes at year-end amounting to ₱11.247 million, broken down as follows:

	For DENR NCR, the above tax remittance deficiency was due to the absence of review and reconciliation made by the Accounting Personnel in the prior years under the manual system, thus accurate/exact amount of taxes withheld did not match the remittances.

	

	The non-compliance by DENR two staff Bureaus, three ROs and three PENROs with the BIR rules, regulations and procedures on the withholding and remittance of taxes resulted in unearned revenue on the part of the National Government, which could have been used for the priority programs of the government.

	

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant of:



a)	the concerned offices to determine the composition of the unremitted balance pertaining to prior years of the Due to BIR account and immediately remit the same to the BIR in compliance with tax laws and regulations and make the necessary adjusting entries, if necessary; and



b)	DENR NCR to review and reconcile the prior year’s tax deficiency.



Hiring of and payments to job orders, contractual and consultants



19)	The agency hired 13,370 individuals covered with Contract of Service (COS) or Job Order as of December 31, 2020 on a semestral basis, in accordance with CSC COA DBM Joint Circular No. 1 dated May 20, 2017, to augment the regular plantilla of employees. Their salaries were charged against Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) in the total amount of ₱1,852.155 million.

	

Non-allocation and/or utilization of fund for GAD programs/activities



20)	The DENR CO, LMB, four ROs and eight PENROs did not allocate five percent of the total appropriations of their agency budget for GAD programs and activities, contrary to Section 31 of the GAA for FY 2020.  Moreover, DENR CO, BMB, Region I and three PENROs has GAD Plan and Budget and Accomplishments Report but not endorsed by PCW, and the attribution of the NGP in the GAD Plan and Budget of the Region XIII and PENRO Davao del Norte has no well-defined gender issue thus, the evaluation of the GAD programs/projects/related activities and cost incurred could not be made.









Section 31 of the CY 2020 GAA provides:



All agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine Development plan (2017-2022).



The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.



Item 8.7 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01, provides that: “Agencies shall submit their PCW-endorsed GPB to DBM along with their annual GAD AR for the previous year in accordance with the budget call.”  



Further, Item 10.1 provides that: “Xxx. The agency GFPS shall prepare the annual GAD AR based on the PCW-endorsed GPB or the adjusted based on the approved GAA. xx”



The DENR CO, LMB, four Regional Offices and eight PENROs did not allocate five percent (5%) of the total appropriations of their agency budget for GAD programs and activities, contrary to Section 31 of the GAA for FY 2020.



Likewise, the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) as well as the GAD Accomplishments Report (AR) of DENR CO, BMB, RO I, and three PENROs were not endorsed by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), contrary to Section 8.7 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Memorandum Circular 2012-01, hence, no basis if activities undertaken were those considered as eligible programs/activities as determined by PCW.



The attribution of the Enhanced National Greening Program in the GAD Plan and Budget of DENR Region XIII and PENRO Davao del Norte has no well-defined gender issue to be addressed and the GAD Accomplishments Report lacks data on actual expenditure and actual accomplishments of eNGP, inconsistent with PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01, thus, there is no assurance that the desired outcomes and goals of the Magna Carta of Women (MCW) were achieved.



The GAD AR of DENR Region XIII for CY 2020 showed that it does not contain data on actual amount expended for all of the GAD activities included therein. Actual accomplishments of the eNGP were also not indicated, hence the template for GAD AR as prescribed in Annex B of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 was not followed.



In monitoring and evaluation of the attributed eNGP, they were only following instructions from DENR CO to use the sector-specific HGDG tool under Box 9, which is for natural resource management projects.  It was ascertained upon audit that the HGDG tool used (Box 9) is not appropriate since it is intended only for planning and budgeting.



In view of the matters discussed above, the DENR CO, LMB, four Regional Offices and eight PENROs are not compliant with the provisions in Section 31 of the CY 2020 GAA and the related PCW regulations on the submission of the GAD Plan and Budget and GAD Accomplishments Report to PCW for review and endorsement.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the GAD Focal Point System at the DENR CO, Bureaus, ROs and PENROs to:



				a)	allocate at least five percent of the agency budget for the formulation and implementation of GAD Plan;



				b)	ensure that the Annual GPB shall be submitted to the PCW for review to have a PCW-endorsed GBP in the future;



				c)	assess the gender-responsiveness of the eNGP projects using the PIMME (HGDG Boxes 16 and 17); and



				d)	provide data on actual accomplishments and amount expended for all of the GAD activities and that the AR shall be fully supported with the financial details and documents.



Non-allocation and/or utilization of fund for SCPD programs/activities

	

21)	The DENR CO, two Staff Bureaus, 12 ROs and 51 PENROs spent ₱7.809 million in the implementation of the activities for the Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability (SCPD). However, RO IV-B and six PENROs did not allocate budget nor formulate any plans, projects and programs intended for the benefit of SCPD for CY 2020.

	

	Section 32 of the GAA for FY 2020 provides that, “All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.

	

	The DENR CO, two Staff Bureaus, 12 ROs and 51 PENROs spent ₱7.809 million in the implementation of the activities for the Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability (SCPD).



However, RO IV-B and six PENROs did not formulate plans, projects and programs intended for the benefit of SCPD in CY 2020, as required in Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020.



The RO 1V-B was not able to utilize the allocation amounting to ₱195,000.00 intended for Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability (SCPD) for CY 2020, in view of the Management’s failure to conduct the one and only activity for the SCPD due to the implementation of series of community quarantines in the National Capital Region (NCR), thus, the expected benefits were not attained, to the disadvantage of the supposed beneficiaries.



Further, six PENROs have not allocated budget nor formulated plans, projects and programs intended for the benefit of SCPD for CY 2020 since their plans and programs for SCPD is prepared in the Regional Office and funding for activities are merely downloaded to field offices.



Thus, the DENR CO, two Staff Bureaus, 12 ROs and 51 PENROs were not compliant to Section 32 of the GAA for FY 2020 as regards the formulation of plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability and the allocation of funds for the SCPD.



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the: 



a)	Regional Director concerned to allocate budget and formulate plans, projects and programs, and



b)	RO IV-B to cause the full implementation of the activities indicated therein for the benefit of the SCPD sector within the Agency as well as those who form part of its clientele.



Receipt and utilization of Disaster Related Fund 



22)	The DENR have not received funds for the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management in CY 2020 except for DENR RO X that received an amount of ₱0.542 million for the Task Force Bangon Marawi. However, said fund was used to procure various computer supplies instead of spending for expenses related to disaster risk reduction or mitigation, and prevention and preparedness activities in accordance to Section 22 of RA 10121.



Section 22 of RA 10121 or the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 provides the sources and utilization of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund.  It states that “funds shall be used for disaster risk reduction or mitigation, prevention and preparedness activities such as but not limited to training of personnel, procurement of equipment, and capital expenditures. It can also be utilized for relief, recovery, reconstruction, and other work or services in connection with natural or human-induced calamities, which may occur during the budget year or those that occurred in the past two (2) years from the budget year.”



Section 4, paragraph 3 of PD 1445 likewise provides that “Trust funds shall be available and may be spent only for the specific purpose for which the trust was created or the funds was received.”



Audit disclosed that of the ₱1 million budget for 2019 Office Supplies Expense of Task Force Bangon Marawi (TFBM), ₱0.542 million of which was utilized to pay various IT supplies such as computer inks, which did not fall on the items allowed to be procured under the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010.



Moreover, of the ₱0.542 million worth of inks purchased, only ₱0.155 million were even used for the TFBM, the rest were distributed to various offices amounting ₱0.387 million, therefore, said expenses should have been charged to the regular allotment of the agency and not with the DRRM Fund.



Thus, the used of Quick Response Fund by DENR X for purposes other than what is provided for by law violates Section 22 of RA No. 10121 or the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010.



We recommended and Management agreed to direct the Regional Executive Director of DENR RO X to:



a)		refrain from charging unrelated expenses to the TFBM Fund and see to it that all disbursements from the trust fund are in accordance with the intended purpose; and

	

b)		ensure that all future procurement chargeable to DRRM funds are in accordance with the items remunerated in Section 22 of RA 10121.



	Receipt and Disbursement of PDAF and DAP Fund



23)	No Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) and Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) Fund were received and disbursed for CY 2020 and prior years.



Implementation of ODA Funded Projects



24)	The Department did not receive and disburse Official Development Assistance (ODA) Fund in CY 2020.

	

	Audit suspensions, disallowances, charges and settlement



25)	Suspensions, disallowances and charges in audit of various transactions amounting to ₱158.915 million, ₱229.882 million and ₱72.550 million, respectively, remained unsettled at year-end.

On the other hand, the NS/ND/NC issued prior to effectivity of the RRSA are not included in the above balance but are still deemed disallowances/charges, which shall continue to be enforced in accordance with Sec. 28 of these Rules thereof.



SS

The above suspensions, disallowances and charges arise due to laxity of controls in the disbursement of government funds, which resulted in the non-compliance with existing laws, rules and regulations.



Because of the unsettled NSs, NDs and NCs, which amounted to ₱407.421 million at year-end involving various DENR Offices, the Department as a whole is not compliant with the provisions of the RRSA as regards the settlement of the Notices of Suspensions within 90 days from issuance, and the Disallowances and Charges once it becomes final and executory and upon the issuance of COA Order of Execution unless authority to settle through installment basis have been requested and approved by the Commission on Audit pursuant to COA Resolution No. 2017-021 dated November 3, 2017.



We reiterated our previous years’ recommendation and Management agreed to:



a)	ensure compliance with laws, rules and regulations to avoid audit suspensions, disallowances and charges; and



b)	adhere to the provisions of the RRSA as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009, requiring the settlement of suspensions, disallowances and charges within the prescribed period to prevent accumulation of unsettled NSs, NDs and NCs.
