The RPCI as of December 31, 2020 
which reported a balance of 
₱552,394.37 was submitted to the 
Office of the Auditor despite the 
non-reconciliation of records 
between the Accounting and 
Supply Offices, inconsistent with 
Section C, Appendix 66 of the 
GAM for NGAs, Volume II, thus, 
existence and accuracy of the 
inventory accounts totaling 
₱5,066,905.51 in the financial 
statements were deemed doubtful. 
 

• Instruct the Accounting and 
Supply Offices to always 
reconcile the RPCI with the 
records maintained by both 
offices before its submission 
to the Office of the Auditor, 
pursuant to Section C, 
Appendix 66 of the GAM for

The accuracy, validity, and 
existence of the Accounts Payable 
totaling ₱9,948,723.89 were 
deemed doubtful due to: (a) long 
outstanding balances of accounts 
aggregating ₱610,653.00, and (b) 
undocumented accounts totaling 
₱263,186.57, contrary to Section 2 
of E.O. No. 87 dated                
August 13, 2019, and Sections 15 
and 37, Chapter 2 of GAM for 
NGAs, Volume I, thus casting 
doubts on the reliability of the 
Accounts Payable account and 
ultimately affecting the fair 
presentation of the said account in 
the financial statements. 
 

• Instruct the Accountant to 
investigate the validity and 
existence of the 26 accounts 
listed in Annex C as well as 
those accounts that had been 
outstanding for more than 
two years and prepare the 
necessary adjusting entries to

years, four projects with negative 
balances aggregating 
₱414,916.42, and 11 projects with 
a combined balance of

casting doubts on the reliability of 
the Due to NGAs and Due to 
LGUs accounts and ultimately 
affecting the fair presentation of 
the said accounts in the financial

• Instruct the Accountant to 
examine and validate the 
existence of the non-
moving and abnormal 
balances of the above-
mentioned projects in 
coordination with the 
respective Project Leaders. 
Moreover, immediately 
return or remit any unused 
balances to the Source 
Agency or the Bureau of 
Treasury, whichever is 
appropriate; and

The hiring of an engineer under a 
contract of service with a contract 
amount of ₱791,111.00 for 
consulting services related to the 
construction of two infrastructure 
projects of CSU, Cabadbaran 
Campus was not made through the 
competitive bidding process 
prescribed in R.A. No. 9184 and 
its revised IRR, hence depriving 
the said Campus of the benefits 
that a competitive bidding could 
grant such as the protection 
provided by the bid and 
performance securities, and the 
assurance of selecting quality 
services at the most advantageous 
price.

The University did not exercise 
prudence in the use of government

payments for related expenditures 
were effected in the absence of 
complete documentation, which 
was a deviation from Section 4(6)

thus, such delay in complying or 
refusal to comply by the liable 
persons with the order or decision 
of the Commission constitutes a 
ground for contempt, and/or 
administrative disciplinary action 
against them.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
A. Introduction 
 
1. The Caraga State University (CSU), formerly known as the Northern Mindanao 

State Institute of Science and Technology, was established through              
Republic Act No. 9854 on December 16, 2009. The University has one satellite 
Campus, the former Northern Mindanao College of Arts, Science and Technology, 
in Cabadbaran City, Agusan del Norte, which is called the Caraga State University-
Cabadbaran Campus. 
 

2. The audit was conducted in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements, and the International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions 
(ISSAIs).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain a 
reasonable basis for our conclusions. 

 
3. The audit covered the accounts and operations of the CSU for Calendar Year    

(CY) 2020 and was aimed at ascertaining the propriety of financial transactions, 
Management’s compliance to prescribed rules and regulations and the fairness of 
the presentation of the financial statements. Value for money audit was also 
conducted on the implementation of the infrastructure projects as to whether the 
objectives of the program were attained in the most efficient, effective and 
economical manner.

C. Audit Opinion 
 
5. The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the 

financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the following 
matters: 
 
a. The Report on the Physical Count of Inventory as of December 31, 2020 which 

reported a balance of ₱552,394.37 was submitted to the Office of the Auditor 
despite the non-reconciliation of records between the Accounting and Supply 
Offices, thus, existence and accuracy of the inventory accounts totaling 
₱5,066,905.51 in the financial statements were deemed doubtful; 
 

b. Requests for relief from accountability were not filed by the concerned 
accountable officers despite the knowledge of 10 missing equipment with a total 
cost of ₱344,868.00 and 109 equipment aggregating ₱4,271,470.80 of which 
existence were unverified. Likewise, the related losses and its corresponding 
receivables were not taken up in the books of accounts; 
 

c. The accuracy, validity, and existence of the Accounts Payable totaling 
₱9,948,723.89 were deemed doubtful due to: (a) long outstanding balances of 
accounts aggregating ₱610,653.00, and (b) undocumented accounts totaling 
₱263,186.57; 
 

d. The balances of the Due to NGAs account totaling ₱110,637,580.49 and Other 
Payables account aggregating ₱6,740,464.27 which, when combined, 
constituted 66.25 percent of the total liabilities of the University were not 
substantiated with complete subsidiary ledgers and other supporting documents; 
and 
 



iii 

e. The Due to NGAs account included 28 projects with balances totaling 
₱4,885,277.10 which have remained dormant for three to six years, four projects 
with negative balances aggregating ₱414,916.42, and 11 projects with a 
combined balance of ₱2,624,409.80 that were funded by LGUs. 

 
6. For the foregoing audit observations, which have caused the issuance of a qualified 

opinion, we recommended that Management: 
 
a. Instruct the Accounting and Supply Offices to always reconcile the RPCI with 

the records maintained by both offices before its submission to the Office of the 
Auditor, pursuant to Section C, Appendix 66 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II, 
in order to present fairly the inventory accounts in the financial statements; 
 

b. Direct the accountable officers concerned to immediately present the PPEs that 
were not verified during the physical count. If the said PPEs could not be 
presented, have them, as well as those accountable officers who are accountable 
for the missing equipment with a total cost of ₱344,868.00, prepare an RLSDDP 
listing the equipment and submit the same to the Accounting Office to properly 
recognize the loss and set up the receivables in the books. 
 
Moreover, instruct the accountable officers concerned to immediately file a 
request for relief from accountability if the loss is caused by fire, theft, or other 
casualty or force majeure. Otherwise, require them to pay for the missing 
equipment at its depreciated replacement cost or replace the item with new ones 
of which specifications are not inferior to the units being replaced. 
 

c. Instruct the Accountant to investigate the validity and existence of the 26 
accounts listed in Annex C as well as those accounts that had been outstanding 
for more than two years and prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct 
any misstatements. 
 

d. Direct the Accountant to hasten the reconciliation process and immediately 
submit the updated subsidiary ledgers and aging schedules of the Due to NGAs 
and Other Payables accounts to the Office of the Auditor. 
 

e. Instruct the Accountant to examine and validate the existence of the dormant 
and abnormal balances of the above-mentioned projects in coordination with the 
respective Project Leaders. Moreover, immediately return or remit any 
unused/unexpended balance, as stipulated in their respective MOA, to the 
Source Agency or the Bureau of Treasury, whichever is appropriate. 
 
Moreover, direct the Accountant to reclassify the accounts aggregating 
₱2,624,409.80, which pertained to fund transfers from LGUs, from the Due to 
NGAs account to the Due to LGUs account.

D. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 
7. The other significant audit observations and recommendations are as follows: 

 
a. Grant of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay aggregating ₱151,562.00 to the 63 

personnel of the CSU, Main and Cabadbaran Campuses were not supported 
with the required authority to physically report for work during the 
implementation of ECQ while the number of hours used in the computation of 
the COVID-19 Hazard Pay for some personnel did not completely coincide with 
the data in the related DTRs. 
 
We recommended that Management require the identified personnel in Annex F 
to submit to the Office of the Auditor the authority granted to them to physically 
report for work during the implementation of the ECQ from their respective 
heads, otherwise, demand the full restitution of the corresponding amounts 
claimed. 
 
We also recommended that Management instruct the heads of each office to 
strictly and thoroughly review the DTRs and other reports prepared by their 
subordinates in order to avoid the foregoing circumstances. 
 

b. The hiring of an engineer under a contract of service with a contract amount of 
₱791,111.00 for consulting services related to the construction of two 
infrastructure projects of CSU, Cabadbaran Campus was not made through the 
competitive bidding process prescribed in R.A. No. 9184 and its revised IRR. 
 
We recommended that Management strictly comply with the provisions 
stipulated in the 2016 Revised IRR of R.A. No. 9184 in the procurement of 
consulting services to ensure that the University is protected from the non-
performance by the bidder of an obligation or undertaking and is assured that 
the best quality of services are obtained at the most advantageous price. 
 

c. The University did not fully implement the Modified Direct Payment Scheme 
mandated by DBM as 242 Modified Disbursement System checks aggregating 
₱41,344,466.43 were still issued to payees who were not among those listed in 
Section 3.4 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14. 
 
We recommended that Management fully implement the Modified Direct 
Payment Scheme by using the existing LDDAP-ADA and SLIIE to settle all 
accounts payable and only issue MDS checks to those creditors/payees 
identified in Section 3.4 of DBM Circular No. 2018-14. 
 

d. DVs, together with its supporting documents, of the CSU, Main and 
Cabadbaran Campuses aggregating ₱172,570,715.87 and ₱6,189,108.32, 
respectively, were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor within the 
prescribed period, contrary to Section 7.2.1(a), Chapter I of the 2009  Rules and 



v 

Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts (RRSA), thereby precluding the 
Audit Team from the timely audit of the documents and communication of its 
results, and casting doubts on the validity and propriety the transactions. 
 
We recommended that Management require the Cashiers to submit the DVs, 
together with its supporting documents, to the Accountants within five days 
after the end of each month and instruct the Accountants to immediately record 
the submitted reports and documents in the books and accounts and submit the 
same to the Office of the Auditor within the first 10 days of the ensuing month. 
 
We also recommended that Management direct the Accountants to immediately 
submit the identified 762 DVs, together with its supporting documents, to the 
Office of the Auditor. 
 

e. The return services required under the scholarship contracts of two scholars 
were not fully enforced by the University while the collection of penalties 
totaling ₱784,997.97 for the breach of the scholarship contract by another 
scholar was not immediately done by the University and receivable account was 
not set up in the books of accounts to recognize the said penalties. 

 
We recommended that Management send a demand letter to the employee 
concerned for the restitution of the amount of ₱784,997.97 and enforce the 
collection thereof in accordance with the FTDC Resolution No. 31, series 2019. 
Likewise, require the identified scholars to render the mandatory return service 
as stipulated in the scholarship contracts. 
 
Moreover, direct the FTDC to submit the said FTDC Resolution to the 
Accounting Office in order for the Accountant to have a basis in setting up what 
is due from the employee concerned.

COMMISSION ON AUDIT 

Regional Office No. XIII 
Butuan City 

 
 

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
 
HON. PERFECTO A. ALIBIN 
Chairperson, Board of Regents 
Caraga State University 
Ampayon, Butuan City 
 
Qualified Opinion 
 
We have audited the financial statements of the Caraga State University (CSU), 
Ampayon, Butuan City which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as at 
December 31, 2020, and the Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes 
in Net Assets/Equity, Statement of Cash Flows and Statement of Comparison of Budget 
and Actual Amounts for the year then ended, and Notes to the Financial Statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting policies.  
 
In our opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the Bases of Qualified 
Opinion section of our report, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all 
material respects, the financial position of ASSCAT as at December 31, 2020, and its 
financial performance, its cash flows, and its comparison of budget and actual amounts 
for the year then ended in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting 
Standards (IPSAS). 
 
Bases for Qualified Opinion 
 
The following matters formed part of the bases of our opinion: 
 
• The Report on the Physical Count of Inventory as of December 31, 2020 which 

reported a balance of ₱552,394.37 was submitted to the Office of the Auditor despite 
the non-reconciliation of records between the Accounting and Supply Offices, thus, 
existence and accuracy of the inventory accounts totaling ₱5,066,905.51 in the 
financial statements were deemed doubtful. 

 
• Requests for relief from accountability were not filed by the concerned accountable 

officers despite the knowledge of 10 missing equipment with a total cost of 
₱344,868.00 and 109 equipment aggregating ₱4,271,470.80 of which existence were 
unverified. Likewise, the related losses and its corresponding receivables were not 
taken up in the books of accounts. 
 



• The accuracy, validity, and existence of the Accounts Payable totaling ₱9,948,723.89 
were deemed doubtful due to: (a) long outstanding balances of accounts aggregating 
₱610,653.00, and (b) undocumented accounts totaling ₱263,186.57. 

 
• The balances of the Due to NGAs account totaling ₱110,637,580.49 and Other 

Payables account aggregating ₱6,740,464.27 which, when combined, constituted 
66.25 percent of the total liabilities of the University were not substantiated with 
complete subsidiary ledgers and other supporting documents. 

 
• The Due to NGAs account included 28 projects with balances totaling ₱4,885,277.10 

which have remained dormant for three to six years, four projects with negative 
balances aggregating ₱414,916.42, and 11 projects with a combined balance of 
₱2,624,409.80 that were funded by LGUs. 

 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 
Institutions (ISSAIs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in 
the Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the agency in accordance with the ethical requirements that 
are relevant to our audit of financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence 
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified 
opinions.  
 
Key Audit Matters 
 
Except for the matter described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section, we have 
determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report. 
 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial 
Statements 
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in accordance with IPSAS, and for such internal control as management 
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the University’s financial 
reporting process. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but is not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud

1. General Information/Agency Profile 
 

The financial statements of Caraga State University (CSU) were authorized for issue 
on March 11, 2021 as shown in the Statement of Management Responsibility for 
Financial Statements signed by our President, Dr. Anthony M. Penaso. 
 
Caraga State University was established through the enactment of Republic Act 
(R.A.) No. 9854, “An Act Establishing the Caraga State University in the Caraga 
Region by integrating the Northern Mindanao State Institute of Science and 
Technology (NORMISIST) in Ampayon, Butuan City and the Northern Mindanao 
College of Arts, Science and Technology (NMCAST) in Cabadbaran, Agusan del 
Norte and Appropriating Funds Thereof.” It was formerly known as NORMISIST and 
the latter was established through the passage of Batas PambansaBilang 241, which 
converted Northern Mindanao National Agricultural College (NORMINAC) into 
NORMISIST. Tracing back further, NORMINAC was converted from the original 
root of CSU, the Agusan Agricultural High School which was established in 1946, by 
virtue of R.A. No. 3604. 
 
The University, per R.A. 9854, is mandated to primarily provide advanced education, 
higher technological, professional instruction and training in the fields of agriculture 
and environmental studies, fishery, engineering, forestry, industrial technology, 
education, law, medicine and other health related programs, information technology, 
arts and sciences and other related courses. It shall undertake research and extension 
services, and provide progressive leadership in its areas of specialization.  
 
Its vision is to be a premier university known for academic excellence in science and 
technology, agriculture, environment and natural resources, engineering, education 
and the arts towards the sustainable development of Caraga Region. 
 
The Agency's Main Campus registered office is located in Ampayon, Butuan City 
while the Cabadbaran Campus is located in T. Curato St. Cabadbaran City. 
 
Dr. Penaso is assisted by four Vice Presidents duly designated by the Board of 
Regents, namely: Dr. Rolando N. Paluga, Vice President for Academic Affairs,       
Dr. Rowena P. Varela, Vice President for Research, Innovation and Extension,        
Dr. Armie Leila M. Mordeno, Vice President for Administration and Finance, and

2. Statement of Compliance and Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements  

 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and comply with the 
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). 
 
The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, unless 
stated otherwise. The Statement of Cash Flows is prepared using the direct method.   
 

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
3.1. Basis of accounting 

 
The University uses the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the 
IPSAS. All expenses are recognized when incurred and reported in the financial 
statements in the period to which they relate. Income is on accrual basis except 
for transactions where accrual basis is impractical or when other methods are 
required by law. 
 
The Modified Disbursement Systems is used to record allotments received and 
obligations incurred. Separate registries are maintained to control allotments 
and obligations for each class of allotment. 
 
Petty Cash Fund (PCF) account is maintained under the Imprest System. All 
replenishments are directly charged to the expense account. The PCF is not used 
to purchase regular inventory/items for stock. 
 
Payable accounts are recognized and recorded in the book of accounts only 
upon acceptance of the goods/inventory/other assets and rendition of services to 
the University. 
 
Accounts were prepared in conformity with the IPSAS and generally accepted 
state accounting principles, and reflect amounts that are based on the best 



13 
 

estimates and informed judgment of management with an appropriate 
consideration to materiality. 

 
3.2. Consolidation 
 

The financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of 
the CSU Main and its Cabadbaran Campus. 

 
Trusts administered by Caraga State University are consolidated in the financial 
statements. 

 
3.3. Cash and cash equivalents 

 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash in bank, deposits on 
call and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or 
less, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to 
insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose of the statement of cash 
flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits as 
defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 

 
3.4. Inventories 

 
Inventories are recognized as an expense when issued for utilization or 
consumption in the ordinary course of operations of the Caraga State 
University. 

 
3.5. Property, Plant and Equipment 

 
Recognition 
 
An item is recognized as property, plant, and equipment (PPE) if it meets the 
characteristics and recognition criteria as a PPE. 
 
The characteristics of PPE are as follows: 
• tangible items; 
• are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental 

to others, or for administrative purposes; and 
• are expected to be used during more than one reporting period. 

 
An item of PPE is recognized as an asset if: 
• It is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated 

with the item will flow to the entity; and 
• The cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably. 
 
 



14 
 

Measurement at Recognition 
 
An item recognized as property, plant, and equipment is measured at cost. 
 
Cost includes the following: 
• Its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase 

taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates; and 
• expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items 
 
Measurement after Recognition 
 
After recognition, all property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.  
 
When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be 
replaced at intervals, the Caraga State University recognizes such parts as 
individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. 
Likewise, when a major repair/replacement is done, its cost is recognized in the 
carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition 
criteria are satisfied.  
 
All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized as expense in surplus or 
deficit as incurred.  
 
Depreciation 
 
Each part of an item of property, plant, and equipment with a cost that is 
significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately. 
 
The depreciation charge for each period is recognized as expense unless it is 
included in the cost of another asset. 
 
Initial Recognition of Depreciation 
 
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use such as when it is in 
the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by management. 
 
Depreciation Method 
 
The straight line method of depreciation is adopted unless another method is 
more appropriate for agency operation. 
 
 
 
 



15 
 

Estimated Useful Life 
 
The Caraga State University uses the Schedule on the Estimated Useful Life of 
PPE by classification prepared by COA. 
 

3.6. Intangible Assets 
 
Recognition and Measurement 
 
Intangible assets are recognized when the items are identifiable non-monetary 
assets without physical substance; it is probable that the expected future 
economic benefits or service potential that are attributable to the assets will flow 
to the entity; and the cost or fair value of the assets can be measured reliably. 
 
Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognized at cost.  
 
If payment for an intangible asset is deferred beyond normal credit terms, its 
cost is the cash price equivalent. The difference between this amount and the 
total payments is recognized as interest expense over the period of credit unless 
it is capitalized in accordance with the capitalization treatment permitted in 
IPSAS 5, Borrowing Costs. 

 
3.7. Provisions 

 
No provisions were recognized during the year. 
 
Contingent liabilities 
 
The Caraga State University does not recognize a contingent liability. 
 
Contingent assets 
 
The Caraga State University does not recognize a contingent asset.  

 
3.8. Changes in accounting policies and estimates 

 
The Caraga State University recognizes the effects of changes in accounting 
policy retrospectively. The effects of changes in accounting policy were applied 
prospectively if retrospective application is impractical. 
 
The Caraga State University recognizes the effects of changes in accounting 
estimates prospectively by including in surplus or deficit. 
 
 
 



16 
 

The Caraga State University correct material prior period errors retrospectively 
in the first set of financial statements authorized for issue after discovery by: 
• Restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in which 

the error occurred; or 
• If the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating the 

opening balances of assets, liabilities and net assets/equity for the earliest 
prior period presented. 

  
3.9. Revenue from non-exchange transactions 
 

Recognition and Measurement of Assets from Non-Exchange Transactions 
 
An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction, other than services in-
kind, that meets the definition of an asset were recognized as an asset if the 
following criteria were met: 
• It is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential 

associated with the asset will flow to the entity; and 
• The fair value of the asset can be measured reliably. 
 

 An asset acquired through a non-exchange transaction is initially measured at its 
fair value as at the date of acquisition. 

 
Recognition Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions 
 
An inflow of resources from a non-exchange transaction recognized as an asset 
is recognized as revenue, except to the extent that a liability is also recognized 
in respect to the same inflow 
 
Measurement of Revenue from non-exchange transactions 
 
Revenue from non-exchange transactions is measured at the amount of the 
increase in assets recognized by the entity, unless a corresponding liability is 
recognized 
 
Transfer from other government entities 
 
Revenue from non-exchange transactions with other government entities and the 
related assets were measured at fair value and recognized on obtaining control 
of the assets (property) if the transfer is free from conditions and it is probable 
that the economic benefits or service potential related to the asset will flow to 
the Caraga State University and can be measured reliably. 
 
 
 
 
 



17 
 

3.10. Revenue from exchange transactions 
 
Measurement of Revenue 
 
Revenue was measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable. 
 
Sale of Goods 
 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, usually on delivery of 
the goods and when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is 
probable that the economic benefits or service potential associated with the 
transaction will flow to Caraga State University. 

 
Interest income 
 
Interest income is accrued using the effective yield method. The effective yield 
discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the 
financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. The method applies this yield 
to the principal outstanding to determine interest income each period. 
 
Rental income 
 
Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is 
accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and included in 
revenue.  

 
3.11. Budget information 

 
The annual budget is prepared on a cash basis and is published in the website of 
the University.  
 
A separate Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts (SCBAA) 
were prepared since the budget and the financial statements were not prepared 
on comparable basis. The SCBAA was presented showing the original and final 
budget and the actual amounts on comparable basis to the budget. 

 
3.12. Employee benefits 

 
The regular and contractual employees of Caraga State University are member 
of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), which provides life and 
retirement insurance coverage.  
 
The Caraga State University recognizes expenses for accumulating 
compensated absences when these were paid (commuted or paid as terminal 



18 
 

leave benefits). An unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting 
date was not recognized as expense. Non-accumulating compensated absences, 
like special leave privileges, were not recognized. 

 
3.13. Measurement uncertainty  

 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with PPSAS, requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting 
amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the 
revenues and expenses during the period. Items requiring the use of significant 
estimates include the useful life of capital assets and estimated employee 
benefits. 
 
Estimates were based on the best information available at the time of 
preparation of the financial statements and were reviewed annually to reflect 
new information as it becomes available. Measurement uncertainty exists in 
these financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

 
4. Changes in Accounting Policies 

 
Caraga State University adopted the following new accounting policies: 
 
4.1. Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards 

 
On January 1, 2014, Caraga State University adopted the PPSASs. This 
accounting change had no significant impact on Caraga State University’s 
financial statements.  

 
5. Prior Period Adjustments 

 
The Caraga State University has determined that some of the revenues and expenses 
were either understated or overstated, thus, the necessary adjustments were made to

PART II 
 

AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
 
  



37 
 

PART II - AUDIT OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
 
A. Financial and Compliance Audit 
 
Doubtful Inventory Accounts Due to the Non-Reconciliation of Records between the 
Accounting and Supply Offices 
 
1. The Report on the Physical Count of Inventory (RPCI) as of December 31, 2020 

which reported a balance of ₱552,394.37 was submitted to the Office of the 
Auditor despite the non-reconciliation of records between the Accounting and 
Supply Offices, inconsistent with Section C, Appendix 66 of the Government 
Accounting Manual (GAM) for National Government Agencies (NGAs),     
Volume II, thus, existence and accuracy of the inventory accounts totaling 
₱5,066,905.51 in the financial statements were deemed doubtful. 

 
1.1. Section C, Appendix 66 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II, provides that “The 

report shall be reconciled with the Subsidiary Ledger Cards and Stock Cards 
maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit, and Property and/or Supply 
Division/Unit, respectively. Any discrepancy shall be verified and/or adjusted 
accordingly.” 
 

1.2. The financial statements as at December 31, 2020 showed that the inventory 
accounts of the University had a balance of ₱5,066,905.51 as shown in the 
following table: 
 

Inventory Accounts Total 
Office Supplies Inventory ₱ 1,155,168.81 
Animal/Zoological Supplies Inventory  30,320.00 
Medical, Dental and Laboratory Supplies Inventory  317,354.00 
Agriculture and Marine Supplies Inventory  49,925.00 
Other Supplies and Materials Inventory  1,498,322.55 
Semi-Expendable Office Equipment  17,084.15 
Semi-Expendable ICT Equipment  628,528.00 
Semi-Expendable Technical and Scientific Equipment   315,070.00 
Semi-Expendable Other Machinery and Equipment  31,830.00 
Semi-Expendable Furniture and Fixtures  1,023,303.00 

Total ₱ 5,066,905.51 
 

1.3. However, review of the RPCI submitted by the Supply Office last                
January 27, 2021 revealed that the University only had a balance of 
₱552,394.37 in the Office Supplies Inventory account and reported zero 
balances for the rest of the inventory accounts as of December 31, 2020 as the 
concerned personnel from the Supply Office claimed that all of the purchased 
supplies and materials, other than those in the Office Supplies Inventory 
account, were already issued to the respective end user. 



38 
 

1.4. Inquiry with the concerned personnel from the Accounting Office disclosed 
that the recording of the issuance of the supplies and materials was done only 
upon submission of the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) by the 
Supply Office. As of year-end, the last RSMI received by the Accounting 
Office reported an issuance of supplies and materials in the amount of 
₱5,317,015.24, bringing down the balance of the inventory accounts to 
₱5,066,905.51 as reported in the financial statements. 

 
1.5. Furthermore, the staff from Supply Office asserted that the related RSMIs were 

already prepared and submitted to the Accounting Office. Nevertheless, their 
office initiated further validation of the balances of the inventory accounts in 
the accounting records to determine the reason for the discrepancies. 

 
1.6. Due to the non-reconciliation of records between the Accounting and Supply 

Offices, the existence and accuracy of the inventory accounts totaling 
₱5,066,905.51 presented in the financial statements were deemed doubtful. 

 
1.7. We recommended that Management instruct the Accounting and Supply 

Offices to always reconcile the RPCI with the records maintained by both 
offices before its submission to the Office of the Auditor, pursuant to 
Section C, Appendix 66 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II, in order to 
present fairly the inventory accounts in the financial statements. 

 
Management Comments 
 
1.8. Management assured that the observations were appropriately acted on and the 

identified differences in the financial statements are reconciled through the 
following corrective and preventive measures: 

• Regularly furnish final balances on the four fund clusters from the 
Accounting Office to the Supply Office;  

• Thorough cross-check records on Requisition and Issue Slip and 
RSMI obtained by the Accounting and Supply Offices; 

• Unreconciled balances will be duly attended within the first semester 
of the year; 

• Ensure that, on the next submission of RPCI, strong coordination and 
proper reconciliation of records between the Accounting and Supply 
Offices is practiced in order to avoid any year-end unreconciled 
balances; 

• The Supply Officer and the Accountant will strictly monitor and follow 
the procedures of Property and Supply Management especially on the 
maintenance of property cards and ledger cards; and 

• Monthly monitoring and submission of reports are highly advised for 
easy reconciliation of accounts.

Unaccounted Missing and Unverified Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE)  
 
2. Requests for relief from accountability were not filed by the concerned 

accountable officers despite the knowledge of 10 missing equipment with a total 
cost of ₱344,868.00 and 109 equipment aggregating ₱4,271,470.80 of which 
existence were unverified, contrary to Sections 73(1) and 105(1) of Presidential 
Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, depriving the government of the proper custody and 
protection of its resources against loss, misuse or wastage. Likewise, the related 
losses and its corresponding receivables were not taken up in the books of 
accounts, inconsistent with Section 41, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs,   
Volume I, thus the PPE and Due from Officers and Employees accounts were 
deemed doubtful and unreliable, thereby affecting the fair presentation of the said 
accounts in the financial statements. 
 
2.1. Section 73(1) of P.D. No. 1445 states that “When a loss of government funds 

or property occurs while they are in transit or the loss is caused by fire, theft, 
or other casualty or force majeure, the officer accountable therefor or having 
custody thereof shall immediately notify the Commission or the auditor 
concerned and, within thirty days or such longer period as the Commission or 
auditor may in the particular case allow, shall present this application for 
relief, with the available supporting evidence. Whenever warranted by the 
evidence credit for the loss shall be allowed. An officer who fails to comply 
with this requirement shall not be relieved of liability or allowed credit for any 
loss in the settlement of his accounts.” 
 

2.2. Additionally, Section 105(1) of the same P.D. sets out that “Every officer 
accountable for government property shall be liable for its money value in case 
of improper or unauthorized use or misapplication thereof, by himself or any 
person for whose acts he may be responsible. He shall likewise be liable for all 
losses, damages, or deterioration occasioned by negligence in the keeping or 
use of the property, whether or not it be at the time in his custody.” 

 
2.3. Furthermore, Section 41, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, 

provides the following, among others: 

• “Lost property and the related accumulated depreciation and 
impairment loss shall be derecognized in the books upon receipt of 
the Report of Lost, Stolen, Damaged, and Destroyed Property 
(RLSDDP) supported by a Notice of Loss prepared and submitted by 
the Accountable Officer. The loss shall be charged to “Loss of Assets” 
account at an amount equal to its carrying amount.” 

• “A receivable account shall be set up to record the accountability of 
the accountable officer simultaneous with derecognition of the lost 
PPE.” 

 
2.4. In calendar year (CY) 2020, the Supply Officer and Inventory Committee, 

together with a representative from the COA Office conducted the physical 



40 
 

count of PPEs of the University on various dates from July to September 2020 
and prepared the Report the Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant 
and Equipment (RPCPPE) accordingly. 
 

2.5. It was presented in the RPCPPE that 10 equipment, whose corresponding 
Property Acknowledgement Receipts were still in the custody of the Supply 
Office, aggregating ₱344,868.00 were not found at station. Details of the said 
equipment are shown in Annex A and summarized below: 
 

PPE Account Quantity Amount 
Technical and Scientific Equipment 3 ₱ 80,000.00 
Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Equipment 7  264,868.00 

Total 10 ₱ 344,868.00 
 

2.6. However, requests for relief from accountability were not filed and submitted 
to COA within the prescribed period by the accountable officers concerned 
upon notice of the loss of the same. 
 

2.7. Further review of the RPCPPE revealed that 109 equipment with an aggregate 
cost of ₱4,271,470.80 were marked as “for verification” as of                  
December 31, 2020. Details of the unverified PPEs are shown in Annex B and 
summarized below: 
 

PPE Account Quantity Amount 
Machineries 2 ₱ 30,000.00 
Office Equipment 12  419,817.00 
ICT Equipment 76  2,571,227.40 
Agriculture and Forestry Equipment 4  590,000.00 
Communication Equipment 1  26,500.00 
Technical and Scientific Equipment 9  296,280.00 
Other Machineries and Equipment 4  316,050.00 
Furniture and Fixtures 1  21,596.40 

Total 109 ₱ 4,271,470.80 
 

2.8. As shown in the foregoing table, 76 equipment or 70 percent of the total 
unverified PPEs pertains to ICT equipment such as laptops, desktop computers, 
projectors, cameras, and tablets. These equipment were procured for the use in 
the various projects of the University. 
 

2.9. Interview with the Supply Officer revealed that the concerned accountable 
officers themselves admitted that the said 10 equipment were missing and that 
some had already submitted incident reports but were not sufficiently 
supported. Moreover, the Supply Officer disclosed that they had already sent 
letters to the officers accountable for the equipment that were marked as “For 
Verification” in the RPCPPE requesting them to present the same to the Supply 



41 
 

Office but to no avail. He also admitted that they prioritized the conduct of 
physical count, reconciliation of balances between the RPCPPE and accounting 
records, and the disposal of unserviceable properties. 
 

2.10. Furthermore, the Accountant acknowledged that accounting entries were not 
made to properly account for the aforementioned missing equipment and set up 
the accountabilities of the concerned accountable officers since an RLSDDP 
had to be submitted to the Accounting Office before adjustments could be 
made. 

 
2.11. As a result of the foregoing circumstances, the University was deprived of the 

proper custody and protection of its resources against loss, misuse, or wastage.  
 

2.12. Likewise, the circumstance pertaining to the missing equipment clearly warrant 
the recognition of the loss of asset and the setting up of the corresponding 
liabilities pursuant to Section 73(1) of P.D. No. 1445, while the unverified PPEs 
raised suspicion on their actual existence as these PPEs should have been 
readily available if proper use and custody were exercised, thus, the PPE and 
Due from Officers and Employees accounts were deemed doubtful and 
unreliable, thereby affecting the fair presentation of the said accounts in the 
financial statements. 

 
2.13. We recommended that Management direct the accountable officers 

concerned to immediately present the PPEs that were not verified during 
the physical count. If the said PPEs could not be presented, have them, as 
well as those accountable officers who are accountable for the missing 
equipment with a total cost of ₱344,868.00, prepare an RLSDDP listing the 
equipment and submit the same to the Accounting Office to properly 
recognize the loss and set up the receivables in the books. 

 
2.14. Moreover, instruct the accountable officers concerned to immediately file 

a request for relief from accountability if the loss is caused by fire, theft, 
or other casualty or force majeure. Otherwise, require them to pay for the 
missing equipment at its depreciated replacement cost or replace the item 
with new ones of which specifications are not inferior to the units being 
replaced. 
 

Management Comments 
 
2.15. Management commented that they had already sent communication letters to 

the accountable officers concerned in order to revalidate the status of the 
equipment issued, particularly on the equipment that were not found at station 
but will continue their effort in locating the remaining equipment that needs to 
be validated.

Unreliable Accounts Payable 
 
3. The accuracy, validity, and existence of the Accounts Payable totaling 

₱9,948,723.89 were deemed doubtful due to: (a) long outstanding balances of 
accounts aggregating ₱610,653.00, and (b) undocumented accounts totaling 
₱263,186.57, contrary to Section 2 of Executive Order (E.O.) No. 87 dated    
August 13, 2019, and Sections 15 and 37, Chapter 2 of GAM for NGAs,         
Volume I, thus casting doubts on the reliability of the Accounts Payable account 
and ultimately affecting the fair presentation of the said account in the financial 
statements. 

 
3.1. Section 2 of E.O. No. 87 dated August 13, 2019 states that “All accounts 

payable, [except those in trust or fiduciary funds], which are undocumented or 
not covered by perfected contracts on record, regardless of the year in which 
they were incurred, shall automatically be reverted. The recording of 
undocumented accounts payable in the books of accounts of agencies shall be 
strictly prohibited.” 
 

3.2. Likewise, Section 37, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides, 
among others, that “No obligation shall be certified to accounts payable unless 
the obligation is founded on a valid claim that properly supported by sufficient 
evidence and unless there is proper authority for its incurrence.” 

 
3.3. Records showed that as of December 31, 2020 the Accounts Payable account 

of the Caraga State University (CSU), Main Campus had an outstanding 
balance of ₱9,948,723.89.  

 
3.4. Moreover, aging of the accounts in the Accounts Payable resulted in the 

following breakdown: 
 

Age 
Fund Cluster 

Total 
RAF IGF IATF BRF 

Less than a year 779,596.23 3,385,421.76 319,454.68 872,241.88 5,356,714.55 
1–2 years 784,974.90 877,840.98 2,025,933.00 29,420.89 3,718,169.77 
More than 2 years 6,461.00 603,772.00 - 420.00 610,653.00 
No detailed information 58,997.05 134,145.52 70,044.00 - 263,186.57 

Total 1,630,029.18 5,001,180.26 2,415,431.68 902,082.77 9,948,723.89 
 

3.5. As shown in the table, liabilities totaling ₱610,653.00 had remained 
outstanding for more than two years without any reasonable explanation for the 
non-payment thereof. Furthermore, the Accounts Payable also included 26 
accounts with a total balance of ₱263,186.57 (Annex C) without detailed 
information. 
 

3.6. Interview with the Accountant disclosed that communication with the 
concerned payees was still to be made to determine the existence of the related 



43 
 

accounts. She also added that reconciliation and adjustments of the accounts 
were still ongoing and was further delayed by the restrictions brought about by 
the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 
3.7. It is to be emphasized that Section 2 of E.O. No. 87 dated August 13, 2019 

prohibits the recording of undocumented accounts payable in the books of 
accounts. Likewise, Section 37 Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I 
does not allow the certification of obligation to accounts payable unless the 
obligation is founded on a valid claim that is properly supported by sufficient 
evidence and there is proper authority for its incurrence. 

 
3.8. The presence of the foregoing deficiencies rendered the Accounts Payable 

unreliable and ultimately affect its fair presentation in the financial statements. 
 

3.9. We recommended that Management instruct the Accountant to investigate 
the validity and existence of the 26 accounts listed in Annex C as well as 
those accounts that had been outstanding for more than two years and 
prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct any misstatements. 

 
Management Comments 
 
3.10. Management commented that the Accounting Office assured that: 

• No obligation has been recorded as accounts payable unless the 
obligation is based on a valid claim properly supported with sufficient 
evidence and unless there is appropriate authority for its incurrence; 

• Confirmation letter of accounts payable shall be sent to the concerned 
suppliers as soon as possible. 

 
3.11. Further, Management guaranteed that identified differences in the financial 

statements will be reconciled as soon as possible. 
 
 
Inadequate Documentation of the Due to NGAs and Other Payables Accounts 
 
4. The balances of the Due to NGAs account totaling ₱110,637,580.49 and Other 

Payables account aggregating ₱6,740,464.27 which, when combined, constituted 
66.25 percent of the total liabilities of the University were not substantiated with 
complete subsidiary ledgers and other supporting documents, inconsistent with 
Section 111 of P.D. No. 1445, rendering the said account doubtful and unreliable. 

 
4.1. Section 111 of P.D. No. 1445 provides that “The Accounts of an agency shall 

be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the 
same time be adequate to furnish the information by fiscal or control agencies 
of the government. Furthermore, it provides that the highest standards of 
honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of 
accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.” 



44 
 

4.2. On July 15, 2020, the Audit Team sent a letter to Management requesting for 
the submission of the detailed supporting and aging schedule of the liability 
accounts. Another letter dated November 12, 2020 was sent to Management to 
remind them of the submission of the needed data and also requested the 
following to validate and substantiate the balance of the Due to NGAs account, 
to wit: 

• Total amount received with the list of agencies, amount received, date 
received and purpose of the transfer; 

• Status of funds received whether expensed/utilized, unutilized/idle; and 
• If unutilized/idle funds, amount and date of return to source agency or 

remitted to the National Treasury 
 

4.3. The financial statements of the University as at December 31, 2020 showed the 
following balances of the liabilities account: 
 

Liability Accounts Balance Percentage to Total 
Accounts Payable ₱ 10,270,169.03 5.80% 
Due to Officers and Employees  2,247,337.88 1.27% 
Due to BIR  3,008,779.29 1.70% 
Due to GSIS  35,151.76 0.02% 
Due to Pag-IBIG  561,535.13 0.32% 
Due to PhilHealth  8,317.13 0.00% 
Due to NGAs  110,637,580.49 62.44% 
Due to LGUs  1,557,176.26 0.88% 
Trust Liabilities  18,896,178.53 10.67% 
Guaranty/Security Deposits Payable  23,213,803.06 13.10% 
Other Payables  6,740,464.27 3.80% 

Total Liabilities ₱ 177,176,492.83 100% 
 

4.4. As presented in the foregoing table, the Due to NGAs account had a balance of 
₱110,637,580.49 or 62.44 percent of the total liabilities while the Other 
Payables account had a balance of ₱6,740,464.27 or 3.80 percent of the total 
liabilities. 
 

4.5. However, despite the preparation and submission of the year-end financial 
statements, Management was not able to provide the requested detailed 
supporting and aging schedule of the Due to NGAs and Other Payables 
accounts as well as its related updated subsidiary ledgers, thereby preventing 
the validation of the said accounts. 

 
4.6. In view of the non-submission of the updated subsidiary ledgers and other 

relevant data, the balances of the Due to NGAs and Other Payables accounts 
were deemed doubtful and unreliable. 

 



45 
 

4.7. We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to hasten the 
reconciliation process and immediately submit the updated subsidiary 
ledgers and aging schedules of the Due to NGAs and Other Payables 
accounts to the Office of the Auditor. 

 
Management Comments 

 
4.8. Management acknowledged the foregoing deficiencies and commented that 

reconciliation of the said accounts were still ongoing but was further delayed 
by the restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 

4.9. Moreover, Management mentioned during the exit conference that they 
planned to hire a CPA in the Accounting Office to assist the Accountant not 
only in the reconciliation of accounts but also in the preparation of financial 
statements and reports of the University. 

 
 
Dormant, Abnormal, and Misclassified Accounts in the Due to NGAs Account 
 
5. The Due to NGAs account included 28 projects with balances totaling 

₱4,885,277.10 which have remained dormant for three to six years, four projects 
with negative balances aggregating ₱414,916.42, and 11 projects with a combined 
balance of ₱2,624,409.80 that were funded by Local Government Units (LGUs), 
contrary to Section 6.7 of COA Circular No. 94-013 and Section 15, Chapter 2 of 
the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, thereby, casting doubts on the reliability of the 
Due to NGAs and Due to LGUs accounts and ultimately affecting the fair 
presentation of the said accounts in the financial statements. 

 
5.1. Section 6.7 of the COA Circular No. 94-013 dated December 13, 1994 provides 

that “It is the responsibility of the Implementing Agency to return to the Source 
Agency any unused balance and refund any disallowance upon completion of 
the project.” 
 

5.2. Furthermore, Section 15, Chapter 2 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides 
that “the financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires 
the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and 
conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for 
assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSAS. The application of 
PPSAS, with appropriate disclosures, if necessary, would result in fair 
presentation of the financial statements.” 

 
5.3. Alternative audit procedures were undertaken by the Audit Team in order to 

obtain information regarding the Due to NGAs account since the Accounting 
Office could not provide its updated subsidiary ledgers and other supporting 
documents despite the written requests for its submission. 



46 
 

5.4. As a result, audit revealed that the Due to NGAs account included 28 projects 
with balances totaling ₱4,885,277.10 which remained dormant for three to six 
years, details of which are shown in Annex D and summarized below:

Total 28 ₱ 4,885,277.10  
 

5.5. Audit also revealed that nine of the 28 projects had significant balances totaling 
₱4,678,097.25 which remained unliquidated, to wit:  
 

Source Agency Project Amount Age 
1. CHED SAFE ₱ 210,185.07 6 
2. LGU BUTUAN Barangay and City Scholars  215,385.00 6

9. DEP ED K-12 Training  359,407.40 3 

Total ₱ 4,678,097.25  
 

5.6. Review of the related Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) disclosed that most 
of the projects listed above had a project duration of not more than three years, 
unless a request for extension was granted. In relation thereto and given the age 
of the projects, the said projects should have been already fully liquidated and 
any excess of the balances should have been returned to the Source Agency or 
remitted to the Bureau of Treasury. 
 

5.7. The Due to NGAs account also included four projects with negative balances 
as shown below: 
 

Source Agency Project Amount Year Reported 
CHED ABAMIN Scholars ₱ (8,188.00) 2015 
LGU BUTUAN CGB FARM  (379,464.91) 2016

DENR ENGP Database  (500.00) 2020 

Total ₱ (414,916.42)  
 



47 
 

5.8. Moreover, 11 projects funded by LGUs, which were supposed to be taken up 
under the Due to LGUs account, were inadvertently recorded in the Due to 
NGAs account, four of which were also included in the aforementioned 
deficiencies of the account. Details of the said projects are shown below: 
 

Source Agency Project Amount 
LGU Butuan LBP Countryside ₱ 132,872.82 
LGU Province of Agusan del Norte  3,601.00 
LGU Province of Agusan del Sur  81,330.00 
LGU BUTUAN Barangay and City Scholars  215,385.00 
LGU BUTUAN City of Butuan  4,500.00 
LGU BUTUAN CGB Claims  2,352,872.21

LGU BUTUAN EO 23 AMANTE  84,740.00 
LGU BUTUAN CGB FARM  (379,464.91) 
LGU Butuan Butuan Solid Waste  139,460.00 
LGU Taglatawan LGU Taglatawan  (26,763.51) 

Total ₱ 2,624,409.80 
 

5.9. The presence of projects with dormant balances totaling ₱4,885,277.10 that 
should have already been fully liquidated, the existence of negative balances 
totaling ₱414,916.42, and the inclusion of LGU-funded projects aggregating 
₱2,624,409.80 in the Due to NGAs account rendered it and the Due to LGUs 
account to be unreliable and ultimately affecting the fair presentation of the 
said accounts in the financial statements. 

 
5.10. We recommended that Management instruct the Accountant to examine 

and validate the existence of the dormant and abnormal balances of the 
above-mentioned projects in coordination with the respective Project 
Leaders. Moreover, immediately return or remit any unused/unexpended 
balance, as stipulated in their respective MOA, to the Source Agency or 
the Bureau of Treasury, whichever is appropriate. 

 
5.11. Moreover, direct the Accountant to reclassify the accounts aggregating 

₱2,624,409.80, which pertained to fund transfers from LGUs, from the 
Due to NGAs account to the Due to LGUs account. 
 

Management Comments 
 
5.12. Management acknowledged the deficiencies and commented: 

• The identified negative balances shall be posted in their 
corresponding proper account; 

• Confirmation letter of Due to NGAs shall be sent to the agencies 
concerned as soon as possible; and  



48 
 

5.13. As mentioned during the exit conference, Management planned to hire a CPA 
in the Accounting Office to assist the Accountant in the reconciliation of 
accounts and in the preparation of financial statements and reports of the 
University. 

 
 
Overstatement of Insurance Expenses and Understatement of Prepaid Insurance Due to 
Inappropriate Accounting Entries 
 
6. Annual insurance premiums for buildings, vehicles, and student personal 

accident were treated as outright expenses upon payment and were not 
immediately adjusted for the unexpired portions thereof at year-end amounting 
to ₱605,888.69 while the stale check for the payment of insurance premiums 
totaling ₱2,198,954.15 was inadvertently recorded as an expense again upon 
replacement, contrary to Sections 50 and 53, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, 
Volume I, resulting in the overstatement of the Insurance Expenses account  by 
₱2,804,842.84 and understatement of Prepaid Insurance account by ₱605,888.69. 
 
6.1. Section 50, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, states that “Adjusting 

journal entries are made at the end of an accounting period to allocate revenue 
and expenses to the period in which they actually occurred. Adjusting journal 
entries are required every time a financial statement is prepared to make the 
statement truly reflective of the financial condition of the entity at a given 
period. 
 

6.2. Section 53, Chapter 19 of the same manual provides the following provisions: 

• Adjustment for deferred items are adjusting entries transferring data 
previously recognized in an asset account to an expense account, or 
data previously recognized in a liability account to a revenue account. 
In contrast to the accrued items, it requires asset/expense adjustments 
and liability/revenue adjustments. 

• Asset/Expense adjustments pertain to assets, portion of which are 
consumed/used/incurred at the end of the accounting period. 
Examples of these adjustments are prepayments. Prepayments are 
expenses paid before they are incurred. At the end of the accounting 
period, the expired portion shall be determined and adjusting journal 
entry shall be prepared to recognize the expense applicable to the 
period being reported.” 

 
6.3. Audit disclosed the annual insurance premiums for various buildings, vehicles, 

and student personal accident totaling ₱3,241,743.45 were immediately 
recorded as expenses upon payment thereof despite its policy terms covering a 
portion of the following year. Moreover, no adjustments were made at year-end 
to recognize the unexpired portions thereof amounting to ₱605,888.69 which 
was computed using the straight line method as shown in Annex E. 
 



49 
 

6.4. Although the GAM for NGAs does not explicitly state the method to be used 
in recording prepayments, examples presented therein suggest the use of the 
Asset Method in which prepayments, such as the payment annual insurance 
premiums, are first recorded in an asset account and subsequently adjusted at 
the end of the year for the recognition of the expenses incurred, thereby leaving 
the unutilized/unexpired portion in the asset account as the balance. 

 
6.5. Audit also disclosed that payment of insurance premiums amounting to 

₱2,198,954.15 under check number 10898479 for the various buildings of CSU 
was debited under the Insurance Expenses account in March 2020. However, 
when the check went stale in June 2020, no accounting entry was made to 
recognize the cancellation of the stale check. 
 

6.6. Furthermore, check number 10994528, which was meant to replace check 
number 10898479 that had gone stale, was issued for the same amount and 
purpose. However, scrutiny of the related journal entry voucher revealed that 
the same amount was inadvertently debited to the Insurance Expenses account, 
thus charging the same transaction twice in the said account. 
 

6.7. As a result, the foregoing conditions lead to the misstatement of the following 
accounts: 

 
Particulars Prepaid Insurance Insurance Expenses 

Non-adjustment of the unexpired 
portions of the insurance premiums ₱ (605,888.69) ₱ 605,888.69 

Incorrect recording of the 
replacement of the stale check  -  2,198,954.15 

Overstatement/(Understatement) ₱ (605,888.69) ₱ 2,804,842.84 
 

6.8. We recommended that Management direct the Accountant to prepare the 
appropriate journal entries to recognize the unexpired portion of the 
mentioned insurances and to correct the double charging of the Insurance 
Expenses account. 

 
6.9. We also recommended that Management ensure that all prepayments are 

recorded using the Asset Method as suggested in the GAM for NGAs. 
 

Management Comments 
 
6.10. Management acknowledged the foregoing deficiencies and claimed that the 

Accountant had undertaken the following actions: 

• Appropriately adjusted the Insurance Expense and Prepaid Insurance 
for buildings, motor vehicles and student personal accident for the 
month of December 2020; 

• Duly recorded the stale check for the month of December 2020; 



50 
 

• Identified differences were corrected and properly recorded in the 
financial statements as of December 2020; and  

• As part of the corrective action, payments made for insurance for the 
year 2021, starting in January, were initially recognized as an asset 
upon payment which shall be adjusted every end of the month to 
recognize the expense applicable to the period being reported. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 
6.11. Although the financial statements reflected the corrections of the identified 

misstatements in the Prepaid Insurance and Insurance Expenses accounts, only 
the journal entry voucher to correct the accounting entry in the replacement of 
stale check was submitted to the Office of the Auditor. The journal entry 
voucher to adjust the Prepaid Insurance and Insurance Expenses account for 
the unexpired portion of the said insurances was not yet submitted. 

 
 
Inadequate Supporting Documents for the Payment of COVID-19 Hazard Pay 
 
7. Grant of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay aggregating ₱151,562.00 to the 63 personnel 

of the CSU, Main and Cabadbaran Campuses were not supported with the 
required authority to physically report for work during the implementation of 
Enhance Community Quarantine (ECQ) while the number of hours used in the 
computation of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay for some personnel did not completely 
coincide with the data in the related Daily Time Records (DTRs), contrary to 
Section 4 of Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Budget Circular    
No. 2020-1, thus, the validity and propriety of the payment of the COVID-19 
Hazard Pay totaling ₱385,611.50 could not be completely ascertained and the 
amount paid to the 63 personnel constituted irregular expenditures disallowable 
in audit. 

 
7.1. Section 4 of the DBM Budget Circular No. 2020-1 states that the heads of 

government agencies may grant the COVID-19 Hazard Pay to their 
personnel/workers without the need for further approval by DBM, subject to 
the following guidelines and conditions, among others: 

• The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for 
work at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed 
official working hours by the head of agency/office during the period 
of implementation of ECQ measures in the area of such office or work 
stations. 

• The total rate of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay shall be based on the 
number of days an employee/worker physically reports for working 
during the Enhanced Community Quarantine period. 

 



51 
 

7.2. Records showed that the Office of the University President issued 
Memorandum Order No. 36, s. 2020 on April 9, 2020 instructing the suspension 
of classes and work due to the implementation of ECQ. It was emphasized 
therein that skeletal work force and work-from-home arrangements shall 
remain in force until further notice. 
 

7.3. Review of pertinent documents revealed that COVID-19 Hazard Pay was 
granted to the 123 personnel of the CSU, Main and Cabadbaran Campuses who 
were physically reporting for work at their respective offices during the period 
of implementation of ECQ measures in Butuan City and Cabadbaran City, 
covered by the following documents:

101-20-06-928  7,529.19 
101-20-06-927  2,188.54 

Total ₱ 385,611.50 
 

7.4. Moreover, the above disbursements were only supported with payrolls, DTRs 
and accomplishment reports, which were considered insufficient to fully 
support the grant of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay, thus, documents showing the 
authority of the employees to physically report for work during the 
implementation of ECQ were requested from Management. 
 

7.5. Audit of the available and submitted documents revealed that the grant of 
COVID-19 Hazard Pay to 63 personnel (Annex F) was not adequately 
supported with authority to physically report for work during the 
implementation of ECQ as 27 personnel of the Main Campus were not among 
those identified to physically report for work in the consolidated weekly work 
schedule submitted by their HRMS Office while the Cabadbaran Campus was 
not able to provide the said authority for their 37 personnel. 
 

7.6. It is to be emphasized that the authority to physically report for work during the 
implementation of ECQ is so important, not only because it was required under 
Section 4 of DBM BC No. 2020-1, but because it was supposed to help in 
minimizing the presence of the personnel in the office by only allowing 
personnel with functions extremely necessary in the operations of the agency 
in observance of the health protocols. 

 



52 
 

7.7. Furthermore, comparison of the documents showing the computation of the 
COVID-19 Hazard Pay and the manually filled DTRs of the listed personnel, 
as shown in Annex G, disclosed the following: 

• COVID-19 Hazard Pay were granted to 15 personnel despite their DTRs 
showing that they were on a work from home scheme; 

• DTRs of six personnel who were on volunteer work for CSU and Butuan 
City Hall did not contain any time in and out entries; 

• The DTR of an employee who had already resigned last June 2020 could 
not be provided by the HRMS Office to the Audit Team for validation; 

• The number of hours used in the computation of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay 
for 44 personnel, excluding the personnel mentioned in the previous bullets, 
did not completely coincide with the data in the related DTRs; and 

• Some DTRs had very unrealistic entries as the time in and out were claimed 
to be 8:00 am and 5:00 pm sharp, respectively, all throughout April 2020. 

 
 

7.8. In view of the foregoing deficiencies, the validity and propriety of the payment 
of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay to the personnel of CSU could not be ascertained 
while the amount paid to the 63 personnel aggregating ₱151,562.52 was 
deemed irregular in nature, therefore disallowable in audit. 
 

7.9. We recommended that Management require the identified personnel, as 
shown in Annex F, to submit to the Office of the Auditor the authority 
granted to them to physically report for work during the implementation 
of the ECQ from their respective heads, otherwise, demand the full 
restitution of the corresponding amounts claimed. 

 
7.10. We also recommended that Management instruct the heads of each office 

to strictly and thoroughly review the DTRs and other reports prepared by 
their subordinates in order to avoid the foregoing circumstances. 

 
Management Comments 
 
7.11. Management asserted that they were in good faith in the granting of the said 

COVID-19 Hazard pay. Nevertheless, Management took the following actions 
in response to the identified deficiencies: 

• Issuance of special and memorandum orders authorizing all 
employees entitled and granted with COVID-19 Hazard Pay to 
physically report for work during the implementation of ECQ for both 
Main and Cabadbaran Campuses; 

• Issuance of memorandum order reminding all employees through 
their immediate supervisors on the time in and out entries in the daily 
time record  (DTR); and 

• Update consolidated skeletal workforce weekly work schedule.

Hiring of an Engineer not in Accordance with Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9184  
 
8. The hiring of an engineer under a contract of service with a contract amount of 

₱791,111.00 for consulting services related to the construction of two 
infrastructure projects of CSU, Cabadbaran Campus was not made through the 
competitive bidding process prescribed in R.A. No. 9184 and its revised 
Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), hence depriving the said Campus of 
the benefits that a competitive bidding could grant such as the protection 
provided by the bid and performance securities, and the assurance of selecting 
quality services at the most advantageous price. 
 
8.1. The 2016 Revised IRR of R.A. No. 9184, which prescribes the necessary rules 

and regulations for the modernization, standardization, and regulation of the 
procurement activities of the Government of the Philippines (GoP), provides, 
among others, the following provisions: 

• Section 2 states that “the provision of the said IRR are in line with the 
commitment of the GoP to promote good governance and its effort to 
adhere to the principles of transparency, accountability, equity, 
efficiency, an economy in its procurement process. It is the policy of 
the GoP that procurement of Goods, Infrastructure Projects and 
Consulting Services shall be competitive and transparent and 
therefore shall undergo competitive bidding, except as provided in 
Rule XVI of the said IRR.” 

• Moreover, Item No.1 of Annex B of the above IRR defines Consulting 
Services as “A natural or juridical person, qualified by appropriate 
education, training and relevant experience to render any or all of the 
types and fields of consulting services as defined in the said IRR, shall 
be considered as a “Consultant,” subject to the requirements 
provided in the IRR for eligibility check and post-qualification.” 

• Additionally, Item No. 6 of the same Annex provides that “the 
services to be provided by the consultants can be divided into six 
board categories, namely: (a) advisory and review services; (b) pre-
investment or feasibility studies; (c) design; (d) construction 
supervision; (e) management and related services; and (f) other 
technical services or special studies.” 

 
8.2. Records showed that the CSU, Cabadbaran Campus entered into a Contract of 

Service on March 20, 2020 with an Engineer who would serve as the Structural 
Engineer for the projects, Improvement of Academic Building (CSUCC - Phase 
I) and Establishment of Ladies’ and Gents’ Dormitory (CSUCC - Phase I), and 
would sign and seal the necessary documents for the Building Permit at a rate 
of ₱791,111.00 payable for 10 months. 
 
 



54 
 

8.3. Moreover, the GANTT Chart showed the following services to be provided by 
the Engineer, to wit: 

• Designing of Structural Analysis 
• Assess potential risks, materials and cost 
• Provide advice and resolve creatively any emerging problems/deficiencies 
• Mentor staff and liaise for the structural design 
• Conduct visits and inspections on site before every major structural work 

commence 
 

8.4. Audit, however, revealed that the Cabadbaran Campus had already paid a total 
of ₱275,306.63 to the said Engineer for the services rendered by the Engineer 
from February to May 2020 through the following checks: 
 

 

 
8.5. R.A. No. 9184 states that all procurement of the Government, whether 

infrastructure projects, goods and consulting services, shall be competitive and 
transparent. It also provided that all procurement shall be done through 
competitive bidding, but when it is impractical to implement competitive 
bidding, the law provides alternative modes of procurement under certain 
conditions. 
 

8.6. However, audit further revealed that the documents attached to support the 
foregoing disbursements did not show or indicate that the hiring was a result of 
the bidding process prescribed in R.A. No. 9184 and its revised IRR despite the 
above-cited services falling under the categories of Consulting Services 
mentioned in Item No. 6 of Annex B of the said IRR.  

 
8.7. Furthermore, it is worthy to mention that payment under check no. 10994478 

included services rendered in February 2020 despite the effectivity of the 
contract beginning only on March 20, 2020. 

 
8.8. In the response of Management to the Audit Query dated September 23, 2020 

of the Audit Team, it was disclosed that the hiring of the said Engineer was 
indeed not a result of competitive bidding but rather it was done using the usual 
hiring process of the University. Further, Management admitted that the said 
hiring process was opted as it was more economical and beneficial to the CSU, 
Cabadbaran Campus. 

 
8.9. The foregoing condition not only deviated from R.A. No. 9184 and its revised 

IRR, it also deprived Management of the benefits competitive bidding could

grant such as the protection provided by the bid and performance securities, 
and the assurance of selecting quality services at the most advantageous price 
provided through the eligibility check and post-qualification conducted by the 
Bids and Awards Committee. 

 
8.10. We recommended that Management strictly comply with the provisions 

stipulated in the 2016 Revised IRR of R.A. No. 9184 in the procurement of 
consulting services to ensure that the University is protected from the non-
performance by the bidder of an obligation or undertaking and is assured 
that the best quality of services are obtained at the most advantageous 
price. 

 
Management Comment 
 
8.11. Management acknowledged the deficiencies and committed to adhere to the 

provisions of R.A. No. 9184 in the procurement of consulting services. 
 
 
Partial Implementation of the Modified Disbursement Payment Scheme 
 
9. The University did not fully implement the Modified Direct Payment Scheme 

mandated by DBM as 242 Modified Disbursement System checks aggregating 
₱41,344,466.43 were still issued to payees who were not among those listed in 
Section 3.4 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14, thus, the University was 
deprived of the benefits of a more transparent, accountable, and efficient payment 
system. 
 
9.1. Section 3.1 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2018-14, which promulgates the 

updated guidelines in the implementation of the Modified Direct Payment 
Scheme due to creditors/payees of all National Government Agencies (NGAs) 
provides that “NGAs shall use the existing List of Due and Demandable 
Accounts Payables - Advice to Debit Account (LDDAP-ADA) and Summary of 
LDDAP-ADAs Issued and Invalidated ADA Entries (SLIIE) to settle all 
Accounts Payables to creditors/payees including utility companies and social 
insurance corporations except Government Service Insurance System (until 
such time that GSIS is equipped to accept direct payment scheme).” 
 

9.2. Moreover, Section 3.4 of the same circular letter states that creditors/suppliers 
who cannot be conveniently nor practicably be paid using the ADA as 
determined by the Agency Head, may continue to be paid through issuance of 
Modified Disbursement System (MDS) checks or cash. These accounts 
include: 
a. Small value creditors/payees with claims during the year costing 

₱10,000.00 and below, e.g., government scholars, recipients of 
DOLE’s Special Program for the Employment of Students; 



56 
 

b. Creditor/payee of the agency with non-regular transaction or one 
time transaction during the year, e.g. Right-of-Way claimants, 
relocation expenses for informal settlers and others; and 

c. Companies which are not authorized, per their internal policy, to open 
current accounts in addition to their existing accounts. 

 
9.3. Records showed that the University had issued a total of 425 MDS checks 

aggregating ₱47,145,082.42 to pay off various expenditures in CY 2020. 
 

9.4. Audit revealed that 242 MDS checks aggregating ₱41,344,466.43 were issued 
to NGAs, Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations (GOCCs), utility 
companies, CSU Personnel, and other payees who had made more than one 
transaction with the University and whose claims amounted to more than 
₱10,000.00. Detailed schedule of the said MDS checks is shown in Annex H 
and is summarized below: 
 

MDS Checks Issued 
Payees Quantity Amount 

NGAs and GOCCs 116 ₱ 37,787,793.80 
Utility Companies 58  1,592,860.98 
CSU Personnel 17  568,078.76 
Other payees who had made multiple transactions 
with the University and whose claims amounted 
to more than ₱10,000.00 

51  1,395,732.89 

Total 242 ₱ 41,344,466.43 
 

9.5. Evidently, the payees identified above were not among those persons identified 
in Section 3.4 of DBM Circular No. 2018-14, hence, they should have been 
paid through the ADA while those payees without a Current or Savings 
Account with any branch of authorized Modified Disbursement System, 
Government Servicing Banks (MDS-GSB) should have been encouraged or 
advised to open one. 
 

9.6. Furthermore, 35 MDS checks aggregating ₱34,782,598.94 were actually issued 
to GSIS despite the said GOCC already accepting direct payment scheme as 
confirmed by a GSIS official. 

 
9.7. It is to be noted that the issuance of MDS checks only contributed to the 

workload of the Accounting Office as these checks will have to be thoroughly 
monitored especially in the preparation of the bank reconciliation statements 
since the clearance of the checks will entirely depend on the payees whether 
they present it to the bank immediately or not. Whereas when payment is made 
through ADA, the MDS-GSB debits the account of the agency within two 
banking days, thus, chances are high that the debited amount is reflected in the 
monthly bank statements, thereby reducing the number of reconciling items 
that the Accounting Office will have to deal with. 



57 
 

9.8. The foregoing observation is a reiteration of an audit observation in the 
previous year. Nevertheless, the circumstances indicated that the University 
had still not completely implemented the Modified Direct Payment Scheme, 
thus, the University was deprived of the benefits of a more transparent, 
accountable and efficient payment system. 
 

9.9. We recommended that Management fully implement the Modified Direct 
Payment Scheme by using the existing LDDAP-ADA and SLIIE to settle 
all accounts payable and only issue MDS checks to those creditors/payees 
identified in Section 3.4 of DBM Circular No. 2018-14. 

 
Management Comments 
 
9.10. Management acknowledged the deficiencies but still opted to continue the 

payment to the creditors through checks due to the following circumstances: 
1. For the utility companies and other Government agencies: 

Refusal on the direct payment scheme because they do not have an 
existing account in the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) 
servicing bank, otherwise, the delivery of services and issuance of 
Official receipts will be delayed if we are going to implement the 
abovementioned circulars to them due to the difficulty in verifying the 
transactions to their respective bank accounts. 
 

2. For the CSU Personnel: 
In consideration of just and timely compensation of the newly hired 
CSU personnel. Although, they already submitted the application 
form to the DBP servicing bank, however, the account will be 
available after three weeks up to one month due to the vast 
transactions of the said bank. As of date, the payment of the salaries 
and wages of the concerned personnel has been deposited already to 
their existing bank account. 

 
3. Payment to the external creditors who are in the Cash on Delivery 

basis. 
 

9.11. Management also claimed that they had already extended their effort in 
notifying all the internal and external creditors relative to the implementation 
of the policies and guidelines of the direct payment scheme issued by the 
competent authority.

Non-submission of Disbursement Vouchers (DVs) in CY 2020 
 
10. Disbursement Vouchers, together with its supporting documents, of the CSU, 

Main and Cabadbaran Campuses aggregating ₱172,570,715.87 and 
₱6,189,108.32, respectively, were not submitted to the Office of the Auditor within 
the prescribed period, contrary to Section 7.2.1(a), Chapter I of the 2009  Rules 
and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts (RRSA), thereby precluding the 
Audit Team from the timely audit of the documents and communication of its 
results, and casting doubts on the validity and propriety the transactions. 

 
10.1. Section 7.2.1(a), Chapter I of the 2009 RRSA provides: 

7.2.1. The Chief Accountant, Bookkeeper or other authorized official 
performing accounting and/or bookkeeping functions of the 
audited agency shall ensure that: 
a) the reports and supporting documents submitted by the 

accountable officers are immediately recorded in the books of 
accounts and submitted to the Auditor within the first 10 days 
of the ensuing month. 

 
10.2. Review of the Report of Checks Issued and Report of Advice to Debit Account 

Issued disclosed that 699 DVs totaling ₱172,570,715.87 for the disbursements 
of the CSU, Main Campus in CY 2020 were not submitted to the Office of the 
Auditor within the prescribed period thereby incurring delays ranging from one 
to 12 months as of February 26, 2021. Details are summarized below:

10.3. Moreover, 63 DVs totaling ₱6,189,108.32 for the disbursements of the CSU, 
Cabadbaran Campus in CY 2020 were also not submitted to the Office of the 
Auditor within the prescribed thereby incurring delays ranging from one to 12 
months as well. Details are summarized below:

Total 63 ₱ 6,189,108.32   

 
10.4. Interview with the personnel from the Accounting Office disclosed that the 

delayed submission of the DVs was attributable to the delays incurred by the 
Cashier in the submission of the DVs to the Accounting Office and the limited 
number of reporting hours of the personnel due to the restrictions caused by the 
COVID-19 pandemic. They also admitted that they could not immediately 
submit some of the DVs as they were not yet supported with the required 
documents and were not signed by the approving authority or the authorized 
representative. 
 

10.5. The Audit Team made several follow ups and verbal reminders on the 
submission of the said DVs, however, the 762 DVs were still not submitted, 
thereby precluding the timely audit of the documents and communication of its 
results, and casting doubts on the validity and propriety of the transactions. 

 
10.6. We recommended that Management require the Cashiers to submit the 

DVs, together with its supporting documents, to the Accountants within 
five days after the end of each month and instruct the Accountants to 
immediately record the submitted reports and documents in the books and 
accounts and submit the same to the Office of the Auditor within the first 
10 days of the ensuing month. 

 
10.7. Moreover, direct the Accountants to immediately submit the identified 762 

DVs, together with its supporting documents, to the Office of the Auditor.

Management Comments 
 
10.8. Management commented that: 

• The dynamics on the disbursement process has been affected because 
implementation of the one-fund concept wherein all the payments for 
the creditors charge to the MDS account for both campuses already 
be processed in the main campus. 

• The delay on the submission of Disbursement Vouchers because we 
have encountered a difficulty on securing the Official Receipts of the 
External Creditors (mostly, 3-7 days within the City and about 15 days 
to 1 month for the suppliers outside Caraga) because they still have 
to verify the payment to their respective depository banks, as reflected 
in the Advice to Debit Account (ADA). 

• Also, for the internal creditors, the receipt of payment in the 
“signature” portion was not immediately signed by the payees 
because of the Work from Home work arrangement due to this Covid 
19 pandemic; and 

• For the Procurement Services (DBM) and other Cash on Delivery 
(COD) payments, Checks were pending because other supplies were 
not delivered yet due to unavailability of stocks/procured materials, 
until it become a stale check. 

 
 
Gender and Development (GAD) 
 
11. For CY 2020, the University had a total appropriations of ₱646,300,000.00. Of the 

total appropriations, ₱34,345,600.00 or 5.31 percent was allotted for GAD programs, 
projects, and activities to address identified gender issues, as incorporated in their GAD 
Plan and Budget (PB) for CY 2020 approved by the Philippine Commission on Women 
(PCW). Moreover, GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) of the University, which was 
still under the review by the CHED Regional Office No. XIII when the GAD AR was 
submitted to the Office of the Auditor, showed that ₱34,418,337.77 or 100.21 percent 
of the total amount was utilized.

B. Value for Money Audit 
 
Lenient Implementation of Stipulations in the Scholarship Contracts of CSU Personnel  
 
12. The return services required under the scholarship contracts of two scholars were 

not fully enforced by the University while the collection of penalties totaling 
₱784,997.97 for the breach of the scholarship contract by another scholar was not 
immediately done by the University and receivable account was not set up in the 
books of accounts to recognize the said penalties, inconsistent with Sections 6 and 
8 of the said contract, thus prevented the University from capitalizing on the 
return services, precluded the utilization of the amount of ₱784,997.97 for other 
prioritized expenditures of the University, and also affected the fair presentation 
of the receivables account in the financial statements. 
 
12.1. Section 6 of the Scholarship Contract entered into by and between CSU, 

represented by its President, referred to as the Grantor and the concerned 
faculty/personnel scholar, referred to as the Grantee, stipulates that “the 
Grantee shall serve CSU a return service of one year for every year of study or 
a major fraction thereof shall be required; per section 2 of E.O. 367, series of 
1989 and the CSU Code Article 82 - Scholarships, Fellowships and Training 
Grants.” 
 

12.2. Moreover, Section 8 of the said contract provides that “Grantee should the 
Grantee fail to comply with the conditions of the contract through his fault or 
willful neglect, resignation, voluntary retirement and other causes within his 
control, he shall refund to CSU the amount defrayed by the Philippine 
Government and the sponsor as enumerated in Section 7 of the contract.” 

 
12.3. Records showed that the University had granted scholarships to 116 CSU 

personnel through scholarship programs funded by various agencies as of 
December 31, 2020, summarized in the table below: 

 
Funding Source No. of Scholars

12.4. Review of the “List of CSU Employees with Granted Scholarship” provided by 
the Office of the Human Resource Management Services revealed that three  
personnel had resigned from the employment of CSU as shown below:

12.5. Based on the table above, the personnel hired under the Contract of Service had 

not fully rendered the mandatory return service stipulated in their scholarship 
contracts as they resigned three to nine months after the term of their 
scholarship contracts. Furthermore, the personnel under Temporary 
employment did not finish his course and even resigned prior to the end of his 
scholarship contract. 
 

12.6. Inquiry through a letter dated February 8, 2021 with Management on the 
actions taken by the University in view of the resignation of the personnel 
concerned disclosed that Faculty Training and Development Committee 
(FTDC) Resolution No. 31, series 2019 dated June 11, 2019 (Annex K) was 
issued to recommend to the Office of the President the refund of all salaries and 
other emoluments totaling ₱784,997.97 credited to the personnel with 
employee ID No. M14-127 while he was on study leave. They also added that 
the Legal Officer designate of the University shall write a demand letter for the 
enforcement of said refund. 

 
12.7. Considering that the said FTDC Resolution was issued last June 11, 2019, no 

document was available to indicate that immediate enforcement of the refund 
was initiated. In fact, the initiative to send a demand letter to the subject 
personnel was only brought up in the reply of Management (Annex L) on the 
issued AOM No. 2021-07 dated February 22, 2021. 

 
12.8. Furthermore, despite the fact that a breach of the scholarship contract was 

committed and the amount of ₱784,997.97 to be collected from the concerned 
personnel was already computed by the FTDC (Annex M), a receivable account 
was not set up in the books of accounts to recognize what is due.

12.9. Interview with the Accountant disclosed that the corresponding receivable was 
not recorded in the books because she did not receive any document as basis to 
set up what is due from the employee concerned. 
 

12.10. Moreover, Management also asserted that the scholars who were hired under a 
Contract of Service had no financial accountabilities to the University as they 
were employed under the “No Work, No Pay” scheme. 

 
12.11. The foregoing statement of Management is not in line with the stipulations of 

the contract as despite these scholars were working under the “No Work, No 
Pay” scheme and thus, were not provided with salaries and other emoluments, 
Section 8 of their scholarship contracts clearly stipulates that a return service 
of one year for every year of study or a major fractions thereof shall be required 
from them. 

 
12.12. Consequently, the above practice prevented the University from capitalizing on 

the return services of the scholars, precluded the utilization of the amount of 
₱784,997.97 for other prioritized expenditures of the University and also 
affected the fair presentation of the receivables account in the financial 
statements. 

 
12.13. We recommended that Management send a demand letter to the employee 

concerned for the restitution of the amount of ₱784,997.97 and enforce the 
collection thereof in accordance with the FTDC Resolution No. 31, series 
2019. Likewise, require the identified scholars to render the mandatory 
return service as stipulated in the scholarship contracts. 

 
12.14. Moreover, direct the FTDC to submit the said FTDC Resolution to the 

Accounting Office in order for the Accountant to have a basis in setting up 
what is due from the employee concerned. 

 
Management Comments 
 
12.15. Management, through the FTDC and Accounting Office, addressed the 

following deficiencies by taking the following actions: 

• Communicated via e-mail, private message, and phone call with F13-
151 and M13-122 regarding their commitment to render the 
mandatory return service as stipulated in their scholarship contracts 
on February 26, 2021; 

• Sent demand letter to M14-127 via e-mail and registered mail on 
February 26, 2021; 

• Forwarded the relevant FTDC Resolutions pertaining to the case of 
M14-127 to the Accounting Office on February 18, 2021 and the latter 
already recorded the receivables from the scholar concerned under 
Other Receivables Account for the month of December 2020; and 



65 
 

• CSU will send an official communication to the Commission on 
Higher Education (CHED) Central Office regarding the document 
showing that the Legal Office of the CHED Central Office would 
directly communicate with the scholars concerned should there be any 
accountabilities they have to settle with CHED. The University will 
provide your office the copy of CHED Central Office’s response once 
available.  

 
12.16. Furthermore, Management added that the return service of the two personnel 

hired under the contract of service will be subjected to the availability of 
positions and the need of their services in the administration, instruction, 
research, and extension of the University.

PART III - STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF PRIOR YEARS’ 
UNIMPLEMENTED AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
 Shown below is the status of implementation of the 47 audit recommendations 
embodied in CY 2019 and prior years’ Annual Audit Reports, of which 21 were fully 
implemented, 25 were partially implemented, and one was not implemented.

Auditor’s 
Validation 

1. The balance of the Construction in 
Progress (CIP) - Buildings and 
Other Structures account 
amounting to ₱297,231,599.21 
included four completed 
infrastructure projects totaling 
₱59,664,742.35 which were not 
reclassified to its appropriate PPE 
accounts. Moreover, PPE ledger 
cards for the CIP - Buildings and 
Other Structures account were 
unreconciled with the records of the 
General Services Office, deviating 
from pertinent sections of the GAM, 
Volume I, thus casting doubt on the 
correctness of the balance of the said 
CIP account, understating the 
related PPE and Depreciation 
Expense sub-accounts, and 
ultimately affecting the fair 
presentation of the said accounts in 
the financial statement. 
 
We recommended that Management: 

AAR 
2019, 
page 
38 

The General Services 
Office committed that 
once the project is 
completed, a copy of 
Certificate of 
Acceptance will be 
provided to the 
Accounting Office for 
proper recording of 
completed projects. 
Moreover, the 
Accountant is still in the 
process of reconciling 
the accounts. 

Although some of the 
certificates were 
already retrieved and 
submitted to the 
Accounting Office, 
the accounts were yet 
to be reconciled by 
the Accountant. 

a. Direct the General Services Office 
to hasten the retrieval of the 
related certificate of acceptance 
and immediately furnish a copy 
thereof to the Accounting Office 
to facilitate the reclassification of 
the completed infrastructure 
projects to its appropriate PPE 
accounts; 
 

  Partially

b. Instruct the Accountant to 
recognize the necessary amount of 
depreciation expenses after 
reclassifying the completed 
infrastructure projects to its 
appropriate PPE accounts; and

2. Twelve personnel of the CSU, Main 
and Cabadbaran Campuses were 
granted the authority to travel 
abroad to participate in the Business 
of Intellectual Property Asia Forum 
2017 in Hong Kong despite the 
suspension of foreign travels in 
Section 1 of A.O. No. 103. Further, 
the purpose of the trip was not 
among those enumerated under 
Section 7 of E.O. No. 248-A and was 
not supported with documents to 
validate its urgency and extreme 
necessity, and whether substantial 
benefits where brought to the 
concerned university/country, thus, 
foreign travel expenditures 
amounting to ₱249,580.91 were 
considered irregular and 
unnecessary therefore disallowable 
in audit. 
 
We recommended that Management: 

AAR 
2019, 
page 
40 

Management submitted 
a letter supported with 
various documents to 
substantiate their travel 
abroad. Moreover, they 
committed to follow all 
the laws, rules, and 
regulations pertaining 
to foreign travels. 

The submitted 
documents were 
evaluated but were 
deemed insufficient to 
justify their travels. 
Appropriate audit 
action will be 
undertaken when a 
decision from the 
Commission Proper is 
made on the appeal of 
the University on the 
disallowance of the 
foreign travel in CY 
2016. 

a. Submit a legal basis on the grant 
of foreign travel authority to the 
12 CSU personnel. Likewise, 
submit documents to support that 
the foreign travel urgent, 
extremely necessary and 
beneficial to the agency concerned 
and/or the country as provided 
under Section 2 of EO No. 248; 
and 
 

  Partially

regulations on official foreign 
travel of government personnel.

3. The University did not exercise 
prudence in the use of government 
funds as the lack of proper planning 
and budgeting for meals during the 
CSU Family Day resulted in the 
incurrence of unnecessary expenses 
totaling ₱120,900.00, contrary to 
Section 1 of A.O. No. 3, s. 2017 and 
Section 2 of P.D. No. 1445. Likewise, 
the payments for related 
expenditures were effected in the 
absence of complete documentation, 
which was a deviation from Section 
4(6) of P.D. No. 1445, thus 
manifesting weak internal controls 
in the disbursement of government 
funds. 
 
We recommended that Management: 

AAR 
2019, 
page

The requested 
documents were 
submitted to the Office 
of the Auditor. 
Moreover, the 
University is now 
requiring the 
confirmation of the 
attendance of the 
participants in the 
activities prior to 
approval of purchase 
requests. 

The documents 
submitted by the 
Management were 
verified and were 
found in order. 
 
Procurement of meals 
and snacks during the 
activities of the 
college in CY 2021 
will be monitored. 
The status of 
implementation will 
be updated 
accordingly in CY 
2021. 

a. Require the Accountant to submit 
all the lacking documents and 
effect refund of the amount that 
would be indicated in the Notice 
of Disallowance to be issued by 
the Audit Team; 
 

  Fully Implemented 

b. The Director of the Internal Audit 
Services need to develop or

4. Had there been prudent planning 
and budgeting, and strong internal 
control in place over the 
disbursement of agency funds, the 
following deficiencies relating to 
expenses for the Geo-SAFER 
Mindanao: Agusan project could 
have been avoided: payment for 
certain expenses during the 
culmination activity of the Geo-
SAFER Mindanao program totaling 
₱304,350.00 could have been 
dispensed with while procurement 
of cultural decors costing 
₱230,000.00 for the Office of the 
University President would not have 
been inadvertently charged against 
the said trust fund, inconsistent with 
Sections 2 and 4(3) of P.D. No. 144 
and COA Circular No. 2012-003, 
thus, said expenditures were 
irregular, extravagant, and 
unnecessary thereby disallowable in 
audit. 
 
We recommended that Management:

Management 
committed to strictly 
observe the provisions 
of P.D. 1445 and other 
COA rules and 
regulations. 
Furthermore the 
Director of the Internal 
Audit Services was 
instructed to execute 
more effective internal 
control to avoid the 
same problem in the 
future. 

The disbursement of 
funds for similar 
activities of the 
University in CY 
2021 will be 
monitored. The status 
of implementation 
will then be updated 
accordingly in CY 
2021. 
 
Moreover, CSU ND 
No. 2020-010-07 was 
already issued for the 
subject cultural 
decors. 

a. Strictly observe prudence in the 
use of government funds to avoid 
incurrence of irregular, 
unnecessary and extravagant 
expenses which could lead to 
issuance of notice of 
disallowance; and

b. Instruct the Director of the 
Internal Audit Services to revisit 
the internal control of the

5. Payments of per diems/honoraria 
totaling ₱129,750.00 to the Board of 
Regents of CSU during board 
meetings in CYs 2016–2019 were 
inadvertently charged against the 
IGF instead of the General 
Appropriation Act (GAA), 
inconsistent with Section 4(d) of 
Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8929, 
Section 1 of the Special Provisions 
applicable to State Universities and 
Colleges (SUCs) under the GAA of 
FYs 2016–2019, Section 5.1 of 
Department of Budget and 
Management (DBM) Budget 
Circular (BC) No. 2003-6, and the 
Supreme Court Decision on the case 
docketed under G.R. No. 211999, 
thus, payments of the per 
diems/honoraria were deemed 
irregular. 
 
We recommended that Management:

Management instructed 
the concerned offices to 
charge the Per diems/ 
Honoraria of the BOR 
of CSU to the Regular 
Agency Fund of the 
Universit1y. 

The per diems are 
now funded out of the 
Regular Agency Fund 
of the University, 
however, the subject 
per diems were not 
refunded, thus, CSU 
ND Nos. 2020-008-
05 and 2020-009-05 
were issued to 
Management. 

a. Stop the practice of charging the 
payment of per diems of the BOR 
of CSU during board meetings to 
the IGF fund and ensure that 
payment related thereto shall be 
charged against the amount 
appropriated in the GAA and any 
deficiency shall be charged 
against savings to avoid the 
issuance of notice of disallowance 
for said benefits; and

involved to refund the per diems

was not completely substantiated 
with supporting documents in 
deviation from Section 4(6) of P.D. 
No. 1445 and DBM BC No. 2018-5, 
thus, validity and propriety of the 
transaction could not be 
ascertained. 
 
We recommended that Management:

the requested 
documents and further 
instructed the 
Accountant to process 
payments once 
complete supporting 
documents have been 
attached to ascertain the 
validity of the 
transaction. 

The documents 
submitted were 
evaluated and were 
found in order.

that before any claim is processed 
for payment, all required 
documents are properly 
accomplished and attached to the 
DVs to substantiate the validity 
and correctness of the claims; and

7. Monthly retainer fees of the private 
legal counsel of CSU totaling 
₱48,500.00 were paid without the 
required written concurrence from 
COA which is a departure from 
Section 4(6) of P.D. No. 1445 and 
COA Circular No. 95-011, thus 
indicating weak internal controls 
over the disbursement of funds and 
rendering the transactions irregular 
therefore disallowable in audit.

8. Notices of Disallowance (NDs) 
totaling ₱696,175.38 remained 
unsettled for one month to four 
years from the date of issuance of 
the NFDs due to Management’s 
inaction to enforce settlement 
thereof, contrary to Section 7.1, 
Chapter II of the 2009 RRSA, thus, 
such delay in complying or refusal to 
comply by the liable persons with 
the order or decision of the 
Commission constitutes a ground 
for contempt, and/or administrative 
disciplinary action against them.

amounting to ₱7.762 million with a 
private bank in spite of the 
availability of various Authorized 
Government Depository Banks 
(AGDB) near the vicinity of the 
University, contrary to Sections 2
