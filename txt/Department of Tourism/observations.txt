PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 

Accounting Errors and Improper Accounting Treatment of Transactions – P3,929,144.05   

 

1. Of the total misstatements of P39,690,514.85 found in audit due to accounting errors 

and improper accounting treatment of transactions that are considered departure 

from the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs), P35,761,270.80 

have been adjusted, while P3,929,144.05 remained uncorrected as at year-end. 

However, the uncorrected misstatements are considered not material to affect the 

fairness of the financial statements as of December 31, 2020 of the DOT.     

 

1.1 Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual for National Government 
Agencies (GAM for NGAs) Volume I requires that the Financial Statements (FSs) present 

fairly the Financial Position, Financial Performance and Cash Flows of an entity. Fair 

presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, 

and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, 

liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in International Public Sector Accounting 

Standards (IPSAS). 

 

1.2 Audit of the FSs of the DOT as at December 31, 2020 disclosed total accounting errors, 
omissions and misclassifications aggregating to P39,690,514.85. Of the total 

misstatements, P35,761,270.80 were adjusted in the books of accounts, leaving an 

uncorrected total misstatement of P3,929,144.05. (See Annex A) 

 

1.3 The uncorrected misstatements are summarized below with details in the succeeding 
paragraphs.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

 

a) Unrecorded bank debits – P 321,600.00 

 

1.4 Review of prior year’s audit observations on Cash Account of DOT CO disclosed that out 
of the P3,769,042.19 unrecorded bank debits, P3,447,442.19 was already identified and 

recorded while P321,600.00 remained unrecorded as of audit date. The Management 

explained that the amount of P321,600.00 pertains to unrecorded bank charges due to fund 

overdraft on June 14, 2017.  

 

1.5 The correctness of the unrecorded bank debits has yet to be validated since related 
supporting documents are not yet submitted to the Audit Team.  However, it is apparent 

that the bank charges amounting to P321,600.00 is a loss to government funds resulting 

from the management’s inability to diligently monitor and maintain sufficient funds in 

DOT’s Local Currency Current Account (LCCA) Forex Account. Thus, the Accountable 

Officer should have been made personally liable for these unnecessary expenses pursuant 

to Section 105 of PD No. 1445 which provides that every officer accountable for 

government funds shall be liable for all losses resulting from the unlawful deposit, use, or 

application thereof and for all losses attributable to negligence in the keeping of the funds.  

 

1.6 Management informed that a letter dated March 03, 2021 was sent to Land Bank of the 
Philippines (LBP), requesting for the waiver of the bank charges with the contention that 

it actually involved government to government transaction. However, as of audit date, the 

Management has yet to receive a reply on the matter. 

 

1.7 The inability of the Management to recognize in the books the bank debit overstates the 
CIB-LCCA and Accumulated Surplus, both by P321,600.00.  

 

1.8 We recommended to Management to: 
 

a. instruct the Accounting Division to prepare the necessary journal entry to record 
the bank charges amounting to P321,600.00; and 

 

b. follow up the request for waiver of the bank charges, otherwise, require the 
responsible officer/s to shoulder the unnecessary bank charges.

1.11 Inquiry with the DOT CO Accounting Division disclosed that liquidation reports on ROs’ 
disbursements on fund releases were already prepared and recorded by the ROs but were 

not yet received by the DOT CO as of finalization of the FS, thus, not yet recognized in the 

books of the DOT CO. Nonetheless, the Accountant of DOT CO informed that these 

liquidation reports were recorded in their books in CY 2021. 

 

1.12 We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant of DOT CO 
to validate the liquidation reports made by the DOT ROs and to subsequently prepare 

necessary journal entries to recognize these liquidation reports in the books. 

Henceforth, ensure that the books of the DOT CO and the DOT ROs are reconciled 

as at year-end to recognize all necessary adjusting entries before closing the books. 

 

 



74 

 

b) Disbursement made to a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) recorded as an 

outright expense – P100,000.00 

 

1.13 Pursuant to the DOT’s mandate of providing support, assistance and encouragement to 
government, NGOs, private stakeholders, and Local Government Units (LGUs) in their 

activities and programs which promote tourism awareness, preserve the country’s diverse 

cultures and heritage, and instill a sense of history and a culture of tourism among the youth 

and the populace, the DOT RO V entered into a Sponsorship Agreement with an NGO to 

the 1st Burabod Musika Camp on February 23-27, 2020. The activity, Burabod Musika, 

aims to encourage the development of Bicol culture, particularly the Bicol music literature 

to create valuable products and experiences for both Bicolano music lovers and tourists 

who want to discover the soul of the region. 

 

1.14 The DOT RO V granted said NGO being one of its sponsors, an amount of P100,000.00 
(per LBP check no. 2753165 dated July 27, 2020) for the activity. As such, the DOT RO 

V was accorded with privileges and entitlement as stipulated in the sponsorship agreement. 

The sponsorship agreement also required the NGO to submit a Terminal Report with photo 

documentation within fifteen (15) working days after the said event. 

 

1.15 The fund granted to the NGO shall retain its character as public funds, and shall be covered 
by the guidelines of COA Circular No. 2007-001. Thus, under Sections 5.1 to 5.4 of the 

said Circular, it is appropriate to record the grant as an asset under the Due from NGOs/POs 

account, and subsequently record the expense upon liquidation thereof to be supported with 

proper documentation. However, scrutiny of documents disclosed that the disbursement of 

P100,000.00 was recorded in the books of the DOT RO V as an outright expense under the 

Financial Assistance to NGOs/POs account. 

 

1.16 Recording the disbursement made to the NGO as an outright expense is contrary to the 
accounting and reporting guidelines under COA Circular No. 2007-001, thus 

accountability for the fund was not established and proper utilization of the fund cannot be 

ascertained. Consequently, this understated the Due from NGOs/POs account and 

overstated the Financial Assistance Expense account both by P100,000.00. 

 

1.17 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. require the Accountant to effect the necessary adjustment in the books of accounts 
to properly establish the accountability of the NGO as recipient of the government 

funds, and thereafter record its utilization upon submission of the liquidation 

report that is duly supported with appropriate documents; and 

 

b. direct the project focal person to coordinate with the NGO and require the 
submission of sufficient and relevant documents as agreed upon and in 

accordance with COA Circular No. 2007-001, as basis for recording the fund 

utilization/liquidation reports in the books of accounts.

a) Unrecorded PPE items – P104,451.00 

 

1.19 Analysis of the PPE account between the Accounting books and the Report on the Physical 
Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) of DOT NCR disclosed that various 

acquisition of PPE items including camera, Intel Core i5 and desk amounting to 

P104,451.00 were not recorded in the accounting books as of December 31, 2020. 

 

1.20 Non-recognition of acquired PPE items resulted in the understatement of PPE account by 
P104,451.00. Further, corresponding contra-asset, depreciation expense for the current 

year’s depreciation and accumulated surplus/deficit were also understated. This connotes 

weakness involving control on the receipt of PPE delivered.  

 

b) Misclassification of Intangible Assets to ICTE - P76,610.96  

 

1.21 Paragraph 6.1.l of COA Circular No. 2015-002 dated March 09, 2015 provides that an 
entity shall apply IPSAS 31 prospectively; where prior to January 1, 2014, existing 

computer software were recognized as part of PPE and the carrying amount of which can 

be determined separately from those of the PPE, these shall be recognized as intangible 

assets. 

 

1.22 Review of the reported balances of the PPE account revealed that 16 items of operating 
systems with carrying value of P76,610.96 were erroneously recorded as PPE under the 

ICTE account. Said operating system is identifiable and is capable of being separated thus, 

should have been recognized and recorded under intangible assets accounts.  

 

1.23 The erroneous recording overstated the said ICTE account and understated the Intangible 
Assets account. 

 



76 

 

1.24 We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant of DOT NCR 
to prepare necessary journal entries to reflect the correct balance of the PPE account 

and other affected accounts. 

 

 

DUE TO GOCCs 

 

a) Error in recording disbursement of fund transfer from GOCC – P1,246,487.98 

 

1.25 Chapter 22, Section 1, Annex M of the GAM for NGAs Volume I provides the Illustrative 
Accounting Entries for Trust Receipts-Inter-Agency Transferred Funds which shows that 

the implementing agency should record the appropriate expense account when incurred 

and only recognize charging of expenses to liability account upon liquidation. 

 

1.26 In DOT RO IV-B, Fund Transfer from the Tourism Promotions Board (TPB) amounting 
to P1,246,487.98 intended for TPB Marketing Support to the DOT RO and financial 

assistance for accommodation of stranded tourists for CY 2020 were noted. However, 

disbursements relative to this fund were directly debited to the account Due to 

Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) instead of initially recording 

them to the appropriate expense accounts and subsequently charging these expenses to the 

liability account upon liquidation. 

 

1.27 The improper recording of expenses in DOT RO IV-B resulted in the understatement of 
the liability and expense accounts by P1,246,487.98.  

 

1.28 We recommended and the Management of DOT RO IV-B agreed to require the 
Acting Regional Accountant to prepare the necessary journal entry to correct the 

recording of disbursements pertaining to the fund transfer from TPB in accordance 

with Chapter 22, Section 1, Annex M of the GAM for NGAs Volume I, and 

henceforth, ensure that all journal entries are in accordance with the GAM for NGAs. 

 

 

MAINTENANCE AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES 

 

a) Error in recording prior year expenses as current year expenses – P1,556,340.09 
 

1.29 The GAM for NGAs prescribes that each entity shall recognize and present its financial 
transactions and operations conformably with the accrual basis of accounting in accordance 

with the IPSAS. Accrual basis is defined as the basis of accounting under which 

transactions and other events are recognized when they occur (and not only when cash or 

its equivalent is received or paid). Therefore, the transactions and events are recognized in 

the accounting records and recognized in the financial statements of the periods to which 

they relate. The elements recognized under accrual accounting are assets, liabilities, net 

assets/equity, revenue and expenses.  

 



77 

 

1.30 Expense accounts of DOT RO V for the period January 1 to December 31, 2020 showed 
that payments of prior year expenses in the total amount of P1,556,340.09 were recognized 

as current year expenses, instead of recording these expenses to Accumulated 

Surplus/(Deficit) account. This condition is contrary to the accrual basis of accounting and 

also resulted in the overstatement of various expense accounts for CY 2020, as follows: 

 
Account Amount (in PhP) 

Traveling Expenses-Local 186,512.34 

Training Expenses 1,157,518.00 

Other Professional Expenses 145,673.36 

Water Expenses 660.00 

Electricity Expenses 15,535.67 

Postage and Courier Expenses 1,888.72 

Advertising Expenses 10,000.00 

Transportation and Delivery Expenses 37,448.00 

Subscription Expenses 1,104.00 

Total 1,556,340.09 

 

1.31 Considering that these transactions and events pertain to prior years’ expenditures, it should 
have been recorded directly to the Accumulated Surplus account conformably with the 

accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the IPSAS and the GAM for NGAs.  

 

1.32 The inability of the Accounting Division to observe proper cut-off had overstated the 
identified expense accounts and the Accumulated Surplus Account by P1,556,340.09. 

 

1.33 We recommended that Management make the necessary journal entry to correct the 
misstatement of the expense accounts affected and the accumulated surplus account.  

 

 

Accounting Deficiencies Affecting the Reliability of Account balances 

 

2. Accounting deficiencies such as unascertained/unreconciled/unsubstantiated 

balances due to absence or inadequate records and/or schedules/documents affecting 

some accounts to the extent of P163,611,355.60 were noted. Based on the possible/ 

potential effects of the various accounting deficiencies, the reported balances of the 

affected accounts could not be fully relied upon. 

 

2.1 Section 6, Paragraph (e) of Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I on Qualitative 
Characteristics of Financial Reporting states that an entity shall present information 

including accounting policies in a manner that meets reliable information which is free 

from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that 

which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. 

 

2.2 Audit of financial accounts with an aggregate balance of  P1,562,077,630.95 as at year-end 
disclosed accounting deficiencies such as unascertained/ unreconciled/ unsubstantiated 

balances due to absence or inadequate records and/or schedules/ documents requiring 

further analysis, reconciliation, physical count/ verification, coordination and future 



78 

 

corrective actions as they affect the reliability, accuracy, completeness and valuation of the 

reported account balances of the financial statements to the extent of P160,651,637.63.

a) Unascertained balances of Cash accounts due to late preparation of BRS – 

P1,427,032.32 

 

2.3 Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I requires the preparation of the BRS in order 
to a) check correctness of both the bank’s and agency records, (b) serve as a deterrent to 

fraud, and (c) enable the agency/bank to take up charges or credits recognized by the 

bank/agency but not yet known to the agency/bank. The monthly BRS shall be prepared 

by the Chief Accountant/designated staff for each of the bank accounts maintained by the 

agency using the Adjusted Balance Method. This is a method of Bank Reconciliation where 

the book balance and the bank balance are brought to a correct cash balance that must 

appear on the balance sheet. 
 



79 

 

2.4 The Chief Accountant/designated staff shall, within ten (10) days from receipt of the 
Monthly Bank Statement (MBS), reconcile it with the Accounting records and shall prepare 

a JEV to recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the books 

of accounts. BRS shall then be submitted within 20 days after receipt of the MBS.  

 

2.5 Records show that several offices were not able to prepare and submit the monthly BRS 
for the Cash/Treasury-MDS accounts and Authorized Government Depository Bank 

(AGDB) accounts on time.  Details are as follows:

 MDS - Account February 2019 to December 2020 - 

Total:   1,427,032.32 

 

2.6 Inquiry made with the Accountant revealed that the reason for the late preparation and 
submission of BRS was due to the delayed release of MBS by the LBP together with the 

paid checks and original copies of the Debit Memo (DM)/Credit Memo (CM). Currently, 

online access to bank balance or snapshots is already available, though details or history of 

transactions cannot be viewed. 

 

2.7 The inability of the Management to prepare and submit the BRS on time caused the delay 
in the verification of the cash-in-bank accounts. Thus, the accuracy of the account balance 

as reported in the financial statements is not ascertained. 

 

2.8 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. compel the Accountant to comply with the provisions of Chapter 21 of the GAM 
for NGAs Volume I in the preparation and timely submission of the Monthly 

BRS as required; and 
 

b. make representation with the LBP to at least provide snapshots of the agency’s 
account transactions to facilitate preparation of the Monthly BRS should the 

bank statements and other documents are not readily available for release. 
 

2.9 The Management of DOT RO II commented that they already prepared a letter addressed 
to the Bank Manager, LBP, requesting for monthly copies of snapshots of the Entity’s 

account should the bank statements are not yet ready.  Likewise, Management mentioned 

that the BRS were already submitted to the Auditors concerned.  

 

2.10 The Management is reminded not only on the regular submission of the BRS but also, the 
timely submission thereof. 

 

 

 



80 

 

 

b) Unascertained balance of CIB-LCCA Regular Trust account due to absence of SLs – 

P31,861,819.74    

 

2.11 Appendix 6 of the GAM for NGAs Volume II provides the use of Subsidiary Ledger (SL) 
showing details for each control account in the General Ledger (GL) which is maintained 

per account and fund cluster by the Accounting Division/Unit. 

 

2.12 The Cash in Bank–Local Currency, Current Account Regular Trust (CIB-LCCA RT) 
account of the DOT-CO is maintained with the Development Bank of the Philippines 

(DBP) as depository bank of funds received from other government agencies to implement 

joint tourism projects and proceeds from the sale of bidding documents.  The CIB-LCCA 

RT account’s GL disclosed CY 2020’s beginning balance of P24,296,919.65 with an 

increase of P7,564,900.09 during the year, thus showing a balance of P31,861,819.74 as at 

year-end.  

 

2.13 It was noted however that the Accounting Division could not provide further details of the 
CIB-LCCA RT relative to the breakdown by source, purpose and amounts including those 

of the prior year’s balance since no SLs are maintained as monitoring control for the 

account. 

 

2.14 In the absence of SL for each source and purpose of the trust account, Management will 
not be able to properly monitor the huge amounts of funds, what particular project was 

pursued, how much fund was consumed, how much was used for the intended purpose and 

how much shall be returned to the Source Agencies or the unused balances to be reverted 

to the BTr. Also, the lack of detailed breakdown constrained the conduct of full verification 

as to validity and regularity of the trust fund balances under the CIB-LCCA RT account 

balance.   

 

2.15 We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting Division to 
analyze the composition of the CIB-LCCA RT account, provide and maintain 

subsidiary ledgers for each source and purpose of the trust funds, for proper 

monitoring and control of the account balance. 
 

c) Unascertained balances of Inventories accounts due to deficiencies in record keeping 

and reporting - P12,383,489.06 

 

2.16 Appendix 66 of the GAM for NGAs Volume II requires the agency/entity to conduct 
physical count of inventories every semester and prepare the Report on the Physical Count 

of Inventories (RPCI) which shall be submitted to COA and shall likewise be reconciled 

with the Supplies Ledger Cards (SLCs), the controlling accounts and the Stock Cards 

(SCs).  Moreover, semi-annual physical count of inventory is necessary since it is an 

indispensable procedure for checking the integrity of property custodianship as stated in 

Section 13, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I. 

 



81 

 

2.17 The accuracy and existence of the Inventories account balance as of  
December 31, 2020 could not be fully ascertained due to: non-reconciliation of accounting 

and property records; non-conduct of physical count of inventory; unrecorded 

receipt/issuances; and other accounting and property control deficiencies noted in the 

following offices:

2.19 The unreconciled balances between the amount per books of account of these Offices and 
amount per physical count was mainly due to the improper or non-preparation of RPCI 

and/or RSMI and non-reconciliation between Accounting and Property/Supply records. 

 

2.20 In DOT CO, the Property Division disclosed that they have conducted the physical count 
of Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory and Other Supplies and Materials 

Inventory and prepared the corresponding RPCI. However, said RPCIs were not submitted 

to the Audit Team for verification, thus, existence of the aforementioned inventory items 

as of year-end could not be established. 

 

2.21 In DOT NCR, comparison of Inventory account balances between the accounting records 
and RPCIs as of December 31, 2020 revealed a variance amounting to P1,403,122.45. The 

discrepancy noted was due to the non-preparation of RPCI for Accountable Forms, Plates 

and Stickers Inventory, absence of regular reconciliation of the balances per books as 

against the actual inventory balance on hand per RPCI and inability to establish the value 

of some inventory items donated by DOT CO due to inconsistencies in the amount. Said 

deficiency was compounded by the non-maintenance/updating of the SCs, RIS and RSMI. 

 

2.22 Further, discrepancies noted between the Inventory account balance per books and RPCI 
of DOT RO VI were attributable to the non-reconciliation of the RPCI and SCs with the 

SLCs maintained by the Supply and Accounting Units, respectively. It was also noted that 

the physical count of Semi-expendable properties and Other Supplies and Materials 

inventory totaling P739,165.26 were not conducted, hence, the corresponding RPCI for 

these accounts could not be submitted to the Audit Team. In addition, 68 units of COVID-

19 Testing Kits were included in the RPCI for Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers 

Inventory. It should be noted that test kits do not fit the description of accountable forms 

which is used in the government operations. Inclusion of different type of inventory creates 

doubts to the correctness and reliability of the submitted RPCIs. 

 

2.23 The abovementioned lapses in the accounting and property controls affected the existence, 
correctness and reliability of the Inventories account balance presented in the Financial 

Statements. 

 

2.24 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. instruct the Property and Accounting Divisions/Units to diligently prepare, 
maintain and update their Inventory records, forms and reports to facilitate the 



84 

 

conduct of periodic physical inventory-taking and the reconciliation of balances 

to promptly correct any deficiencies noted; and 

  

b. henceforth, require the Accountant to recognize the inventory account for every 
purchase of semi-expendable equipment, and ensure that the expense accounts 

shall only be recorded upon issuance thereof, except for supplies and materials 

that are properly purchased out of the Petty Cash Fund (PCF). 

 

2.25 The Management of DOT CO commented that they have submitted the revised RPCI 
consistent with the instructions set forth in Appendix No. 66 of the GAM for NGAs 

Volume II in compliance with the recommendations of the Auditors. 

 

d) Non-disposal of obsolete/expired inventories – P81,923.55 

 

2.26 Paragraph 44, IPSAS 12, and Sections 7 and 8, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs Volume 
I require the recognition of expense in case of any write-down of inventories and shall be 

recorded in the period the write-down or loss occurs.  

 

2.27 Verification and analysis of the Inventories account of DOT NCR revealed that obsolete 
office supplies with a total amount of P81,923.55 remained undisposed as of December 31, 

2020. These obsolete items pertain to computer inks that were already expired and supplies 

that can no longer be used. The delay of disposal was caused by the pandemic situation and 

work constraints during the quarantine period. In addition, Management also failed to form 

a Disposal Committee that will handle the disposal. 

 

2.28 The non-disposal of the listed obsolete office supplies resulted in accumulation of 
significant number of inventories occupying large space in the office which served as 

warehouse. Said obsolete inventory items were exposed to gradual deterioration and 

obsolescence which could lessen their economic value to the detriment of benefits that may 

accrue to the government. Likewise, these inventories were still recognized in the books as 

assets when they should be written down already.  

 

2.29 We recommended and the DOT NCR Management agreed to create a Disposal 
Committee to take appropriate action in the disposal of obsolete office supplies. 

 

2.30 We also recommend that Management require the Accounting Section to effect 
appropriate adjustments in the inventory accounts to recognize impairment of the 

assets and to eventually derecognize them upon disposal.   

 

e) Improper costing of inventories – P124,889.58 

 

2.31 IPSAS 12 and the GAM for NGAs prescribes the weighted average method in costing 
inventories. 

 

2.32 The Accounting Section of DOT RO X has been using the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) 
Method in costing its Office Supplies Inventory on the ground that they are not aware of 



85 

 

the prescribed accounting standard. Also, the SLC which is a basic record of control of 

receipts and issuance of inventory, and necessary in the application of any costing method, 

has not been maintained for the same reason. 

 

2.33 Improper costing of inventories affects the fair presentation of the Office Supplies account 
balance of P124,889.58 in the financial statements as of December 31, 2020. 

 

2.34 We recommended that management require the DOT RO X Accounting Section to 
maintain SLC for each inventory item and use the weighted average method. 

 

f) Unreconciled variance between PPE balances per books and per RPCPPE  

 

2.35 Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I covers the accounting for PPE which includes, 
among others, the necessity of an annual physical count of PPE, maintenance of property 

ledger cards and property cards by the Accounting and Property Units, respectively and 

intra-agency transfers of PPE. 

 

2.36 The recorded PPE of DOT ROs showed a variance of P12,562,194.97 as against the 
physical count. Details are shown in the table as follows:

balance per books and RPCPPE are duly 

reconciled however, auditor’s independent 

verification on said Management’s assertion 

could not be done due to the delayed 

submission of financial reports by the 

Accounting Division. It was also noted that 

there are various versions of RPCPPE 

containing different balances which were 

submitted to the Office of the Auditor. 

thereby causing confusion to the Audit Team 

and doubts on the correct/final PPE balance 

that was physically counted. 

NCR 71,240.00 75,785.00 4,545.00 Discrepancies noted could not be reconciled 

since the DOT NCR Management was not 

able to determine whether all of its assets 

were existing, obsolete or missing or whether 

the reported properties were properly valued. 

CAR 479,465.99 - 479,465.99 Discrepancies noted was due to the 

following: 

 The Property Cards (PCs) contain 
incorrect balances and did not include 

two laptops costing P69,000.00 each with 

remaining useful life of 6 years and 4 

months as of year-end. 

 The Property Acknowledgement 
Receipts (PARs) were not updated. 

 The annual physical count of property as 
of December 31, 2020 was not completed 

by the Property Unit, hence no RPCPPE 

was prepared.

utmost attention due to workload. 

IVA 6,933,045.90 8,048,423.76 1,115,377.86            Variance noted was due to the following: 

 Recorded PPE not appearing in the

 Account name used for the same PPE 
items amounting to P183,946.00 are 

different in the records of Property and 

Accounting Units.  

 Lack of coordination between the 
Accounting and the Property Units 

IVB 1,964,026.29 5,026,408.61 3,062,382.32 Variance of P3,062,382.32 pertains to one 

Motor Vehicle, one Office Equipment and 30 

ICT equipment that were transferred from 

the CO to the RO which are already reported 

in the RCPPE but were not recorded in the 

SL. The transferred property were not yet 

recorded in the books because they are still 

waiting for the documents from the DOT CO 

for the dropping of the said property in their 

books. 

VI 10,783,148.61 11,984,470.71 1,201,322.10 The difference noted were attributed to the 

following: 

 Non-reconciliation between RPCPPE and 
the accounting records 

 Various PPEs in the RPCPPE have no 
monetary value. 

 18 PPE items totaling P400,543.37 were 
excluded in the books of accounts. 

VII 3,791,895.63 5,693,472.26 1,901,576.63 Reasons for the variances are as follows: 

 Various PPE items were recorded in the 
RPCPPE but not recorded in the books of 

accounts. 

 Various PPE items were recognized in the 
accounting records but not included in the 

RPCPPE. 

 Difference in the classification of PPE 
items between the records of Property and 

Accounting Unit 

 Recognition of PPE items below the 
capitalization threshold in the RPCPPE 

X 6,530,341.92 3,288,901.34 3,241,440.58 The discrepancies pertain to the following: 

 There was no coordination between the 
Accounting and Property Section 

regarding the proper accounting 

treatment of PPE items. 

 The description of the items between the 
accounting and property records differs, 

thus complicating more the 

reconciliation. 

 Several PPE items reported in the 
RPCPPE do not have unit values. Said

TOTAL   12,562,194.97  

 

2.37 The practice of the agencies reflected poor internal control system on property accounting 
and management since DOT offices concerned were not able to establish the fair valuation 

of properties through reconciliation of the balances per books and per physical count.  

 

2.38 Management from DOT RO VI commented that an appraisal committee was created but 
was unable to properly convene and prepare an appraisal due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The Accountant further stated that the 18 PPEs totaling P400,543.37 were already taken 

up in the books. 

 

2.39 The Accountant and the Property Officer of DOT RO VII have made the necessary initial 
actions to reconcile the balances of their respective records, and to comply with the audit 

recommendations. Moreover, the Accounting Division maintained the PPELC while the 

Property Officer-Designate conducted physical count of the PPE and updated the PCs and 

PARs. They also stated that the variances of the CY 2020 year-end balances were due to 

the assets received from the DOT CO with lacking documents. Nevertheless, the 

Accountant already requested the said documents so that these can be properly recorded in 

the books of accounts.  

 

2.40 The Audit Team commended the Management on its immediate action. Nevertheless, the 
Team emphasizes that in order for the agency to have fair presentation of its financial 

statements, reconciliation of the PPE accounts should be made by the Accountant and the 

Property Officer.  

 

2.41 We recommended and Management agreed to strengthen controls in property 
management by conducting periodic physical inventory taking, preparing the 

corresponding RPCPPE for reconciliation with the accounting records, maintaining 

updated PPELCs, PCs and PARs and by creating inventory/appraisal committee to 

appraise and assign values to various properties with no monetary values in the 

RPCPPE. 

 

g) Non-disposal of unserviceable property - P1,604,905.03 
 

2.42 Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) 1445 directs the disposal of all government property 
when they become unserviceable for any cause. 

 

2.43 The results of annual physical count of PPE revealed that a motor vehicle amounting 
P104,800.00 was no longer capable of providing economic benefits or service potential to 



88 

 

the DOT NCR caused by physical damage. However, said unserviceable property was still 

undisposed as of December 31, 2020 due to the absence of a disposal committee to conduct 

an inspection and evaluation of the property for eventual disposal. 

 

2.44 Likewise, unserviceable property of DOT CAR with carrying value of at least P73,426.32 
were not disposed as of year-end. The Property Unit informed that the Inventory and 

Inspection Report on Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) is not yet complete. 

 

2.45 On the other hand, the CY 2019 identified unserviceable and/or obsolete PPE of DOT RO 
II with a total amount of P1,105,488.62, remained undisposed as of December 31, 2020.  

Management scheduled the disposal three (3) times during the year, but failed to dispose 

the same as of year-end. 

 

2.46 In addition, records showed that an IIRUP was already prepared on July 20, 2018, by the 
DOT RO IVA.  However, the total unserviceable properties in the amount of P321,190.09, 

remained undisposed for a period of two years since CY 2018. 

 

2.47 The non-disposal of the unserviceable properties will expose the same to further 
deterioration and deprives the government of additional revenue that may be generated 

from the sale thereof. Also, the prolonged disposal of unserviceable assets prevents the 

optimal use of office space and entails added burden for its safekeeping. 

 

2.48 During the exit conference, the Management of DOT NCR committed to create a new 
composition of the Inventory and Disposal Committee and to submit copy of the Office 

Order to be issued or its equivalent to the Audit Team. 

 

2.49 On the other hand, the Management of DOT RO II commented that unserviceable PPE of 
the office were not disposed in December 2020 due to the non-response of bidder/buyer 

and unfavorable weather that prevented the activity.  However, disposal was successfully 

carried out on January 12, 2021. 

 

2.50 We recommended that the Management of the DOT offices create a Disposal 
Committee for the completion of the IIRUP and to facilitate the disposal of the 

unserviceable properties and the corresponding de-recognition of the same after the 

disposal to prevent their further deterioration or devaluation and to clear up the 

spaces where the properties are stored. 

 

h) No proper turn-over of PPE items and infrastructure asset – P46,397,298.69 

 

2.51 Paragraph 14 of IPSAS 17 and Section 3, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I 
states that the cost of an item of PPE shall be recognized as an asset if, and only if: it is 

probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will 

flow to the entity; and, the cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably. 

 



89 

 

2.52 Review of the submitted RPCPPE of DOT CO revealed that various PPE items with 
acquisition cost totaling to P29,026,994.29 were located in DOT ROs and were being used 

by the officials and employees of the ROs. 

 

2.53 Considering that the economic benefits or service potential of these PPE items flow to the 
said ROs and beneficial ownership and control of the PPE clearly rest to them, it would be 

appropriate to recognize and record these PPE in the books of the ROs concerned instead 

of DOT CO. 

 

2.54 As disclosed under Note No. 9.1.3 of the Notes to FS, there are Parks, Plazas and 
Monuments and Other Infrastructure accounts with balances of P17,147,508.40 and 

P222,796.00, respectively, or a total of P17,370,304.40 in DOT RO I as of December 31, 

2020. These assets pertain to costs of construction of gymnasiums and 

improvement/rehabilitation of town plazas implemented by various LGUs and funded 

through fund transfers of DOT RO I way back in 1993-1994. 

 

2.55 These infrastructure projects should have been turned-over or transferred by the DOT RO 
I to the LGUs upon project completion to transfer ownership and recording of the PPE 

account since these projects were implemented by the LGU and were constructed for their 

benefit and use. However, Management disclosed that some of the infrastructure projects 

under the said account no longer exist and have been replaced by new LGU 

infrastructure/development projects. Moreover, incumbent Local Chief Executives are 

reluctant to issue the necessary documents such as the Certificate of Completion and 

Certificate of Turn-over and Acceptance since these were constructed prior to their term of 

office. 

 

2.56 The recognition of PPE no longer owned and controlled by the DOT CO and DOT RO I 
affected the reliability of the account balance in their Financial Statements and the non-

transfer of said PPE items to their beneficial owners only added unnecessary accountability 

and responsibility to these offices. 

 

2.57 We recommended that Management prepare/obtain the necessary documents 
transferring the PPEs such as Certificate of Completion and Certificate of Turn-over 

and Acceptance to the DOT ROs and LGUs concerned and subsequently derecognize 

the same in the respective books of accounts of the DOT CO and RO for the fair 

presentation of the financial statements. Henceforth, we recommend that the 

Management immediately obtain the required Certificate of Completion and 

Certificate of Acceptance upon completion of the Project.  

 

2.58 Management from the DOT CO commented that Property Transfer Reports (PTRs) are 
already being prepared by the General Services - Supply and Property Section (GSD-SPS) 

for the immediate transfer of the PPEs located/used by the DOT ROs. 

 

2.59 Management of DOT RO I agreed to exert extra effort and to exhaust all possible means 
to obtain the needed Certificate of Completion and Acceptance.

i) Unascertained Construction-in-Progress (CIP) – Infrastructure Asset account 

balance - P1,401,304.95 

 

2.60 Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I requires that the Accountant shall 
maintain the PPELC for each category of PPE.  Moreover, Section 3.1 of COA Circular 

No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 states that fund transfers should be properly taken up in 

the books of both source and implementing agencies, used only for the purpose intended, 

and properly accounted and reported. 

 

2.61 The CIP-Infrastructure Asset account under Fund 171 of the DOT CO reported a balance 
of P163,490,574.02 as of December 31, 2020. Inquiry with the Accounting Division 

disclosed that the total amount of CIP-Infrastructure Asset account was composed of the 

fund transfers of DOT CO to the National Museum of the Philippines (NMP), Intramuros 

Administration (IA), Department and Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and R.U. 

Aquino Construction and Development Corporation and Prismodial Construction 

Corporation, Joint Venture for the implementation of both Phase I and Phase II of the 

Maestranza Curtain Wall Reconstruction Project. 

 

2.62 Review of available documents disclosed that the actual disbursements for the said project 
only amounted to P162,089,269.07. Thus, comparison of reported CIP-Infrastructure Asset 

account balance and actual disbursements resulted in a discrepancy of P1,401,304.95. The 

discrepancy could not be explained due to the inability of the Management to maintain a 

SL containing the details of the account. 

 

2.63 Non-reconciliation of the CIP-Infrastructure Asset account balance per books and the 
actual disbursements made to various payors affected the reliability of the CIP balance 

reflected in the Financial Statements of DOT. 

 

2.64 Management commented that they are still coordinating with the retired staff who handled 
the Maestranza books to determine if there are additional adjustments necessary to correct 

the CIP-Infrastructure Asset.  

 

2.65 During the exit conference, the Audit Team emphasized the importance of the preparation 
of SLs per account and per project as this will help the Management to monitor the account 

balances and the status of implementation of the projects. 

 

2.66 We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant to: 
 

a. evaluate the composition of the CIP-Infrastructure asset account balance and the 
actual disbursements made for the Project and draw necessary adjusting journal 

entries to correct the PPE accounts affected; and  

 

b. prepare and maintain the required subsidiary ledger for the CIP-Infrastructure 
Asset account.   

 



91 

 

j) Unreconciled Financial Accountability Report (FAR) No. 3 and year-end balance of 

Accounts Payable 

 

2.67 COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2019-1 dated January 1, 2019 requires Agencies to regularly 
submit accountability reports to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and 

to COA in compliance with pertinent Sections of the General Appropriations Act. With the 

adoption of the annual cash-based appropriations starting FY 2019 and taking into the 

account the one-year availability of funds for the government’s 

programs/activities/projects, the Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs) 

forms and contents need to be fine-tuned to ensure that they generate quality adequate 

information to enable the DBM and the COA, as oversight agencies, to effectively report, 

monitor and/or evaluate agency performance as basis for sound policy decision, in a timely 

manner.  

 

2.68 Review of the submitted Financial Accountability Report (FAR) No. 3 of the DOT CO 
disclosed that the total due and demandable obligations as of December 31, 2020 amounted 

to P488,208,569.80. Verification from the SL of Accounts Payable disclosed that only 

P432,442,072.09 is recorded in the books, hence a discrepancy of P55,766,497.71.  

 

2.69 Inquiry with the Accounting Division disclosed that the discrepancy is allegedly due to 
lack of close coordination between the Accounting and Budget Divisions in the preparation 

and submission of FAR No. 3. This should not be the case considering that Chiefs of both 

Divisions certify the correctness of the said report. It was further explained that it is the 

FAR No. 3 which was mistakenly prepared.  

 

2.70 Considering that FAR No. 3 serves as the basis of the DBM in determining the funds to be 
released to the DOT to cover prior years’ obligations, it should be noted that the amount of 

due and demandable obligations as recorded in the books as Accounts Payable shall tally 

with the amount reflected in FAR No. 3. Likewise, the discrepancies noted exposed the 

Accounts Payable and related Expense accounts to possible understatement of 

P55,766,497.71.  

 

2.71 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. require the DOT CO Accountant to reconcile the due and demandable obligations 
reported under FAR No. 3 and the list of Accounts Payable recorded in the books 

of accounts; and prepare the necessary adjusting entries to recognize any 

unrecorded due and demandable obligations. Accordingly, revise and resubmit 

the corrected FAR No. 3; and 

 

b. advise the Accounting and Budget Divisions to closely coordinate in the 
preparation of FAR No. 3 and to ensure that it is duly reviewed before certifying 

its correctness. 

 

2.72 Management of DOT CO commented during the exit conference that the Accounting and 
Budget Divisions have coordinated to correct the errors and that they have already 



92 

 

submitted the revised FAR No. 3 to the Audit Team. A Memorandum dated April 23, 2021 

was issued to the Chief, Budget Division and the OIC-Chief Accountant directing them to 

reconcile the entries in the reported FAR No. 3, and to make the necessary adjustments to 

correct errors found. 

 

2.73 Management further stated that in the same memorandum, they have advised the Budget 
and Accounting Divisions to closely coordinate with each other in the preparation of FAR 

No. 3 before certifying on the correctness of the report, thus ensuring that financial reports 

submitted by the DOT to Oversight Agencies are accurate and reliable. 

 

 

COMPLIANCE AUDIT 

 

Full utilization of funds not attained 

 

3. Of the total allotments/authorized budget of P2,203,356,911.05 received by the DOT 
in CY 2020, P1,973,465,138.36 or 89.57 percent was obligated, leaving an unobligated 

balance of P229,891,772.68. Of the obligated amount, only 54.33 percent or 

P1,072,241,521.65 was actually utilized and disbursed for ongoing projects and 

activities, including locally-funded projects for Branding Campaign and Market and 

Product Development, as a result of inadequate procurement planning.   

 
3.1 Section 60 of the General Provisions (GPs) of Republic Act (RA) No. 11465 or the General 

Appropriations Act (GAA) of FY 2020, provides that the appropriations authorized shall 

be valid for release and obligation for the purpose specified until December 31, 2020.  The 

validity is subject to pertinent special and general provisions of said GAA, the President’s 

Veto message on the implementation of cash budgeting, as well as other pertinent laws. 

 

3.2 Paragraph 3.4 of the National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 578 dated January 6, 2020, 
provides that the obligational authorities to be issued shall conform to the following period 

of validity: 
 

3.4. With the adoption of the Cash Budgeting System (CBS) and consistent with 

Section 60, GPs of the FY 2020 GAA, all appropriations authorized under the FY 2020 

GAA, including budgetary support to Government-owned and Controlled Corporations 

(GOCCs) and Special Account in the General Fund, shall be available for release and 

disbursement for the purpose specified, and under the same General and Special 

Provisions of said GAA  applicable thereto until December 31, 2020. 

 

3.4.1 The appropriations for the following items under the FY 2020 GAA shall be 

valid for the obligation until December 31, 2020: 

 

3.4.1.1 Infrastructure Capital Outlays, including subsidy releases to 

GOCCs for infrastructure projects; and 

 



93 

 

3.4.1.2 Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) and other 

Capital Outlay items. 

 

3.3 In general, a government budget is the financial plan of a government for a given period, 
usually for a fiscal year, which shows how the government’s resources will be generated 

and used over the fiscal period. The budget is the government’s key instrument for 

promoting its socio-economic objectives. The government budget also refers to the income, 

expenditures and sources of borrowings of the National Government that are used to 

achieve national objectives, strategies and programs.  

 

3.4 The authorized budget of the DOT CO and its 15 Regional Offices, obligations, 
disbursements and balances for CY 2020 are summarized in the table below.

3.5 Analysis showed that out of the total allotments or authorized budget of P2,203,356,911.05 
received by the DOT in CY 2020, P1,973,465,138.36 or 89.57 percent were obligated, 

leaving an unobligated balance of P229,891,772.68 or 10.43 percent of the total allotments. 

However, despite the high obligation rate, actual disbursements only amounted to 

P1,072,241,521.65 or 54.33 percent of the total obligations. The undisbursed obligations 

aggregating P901,223,616.72 was primarily attributable to MOOE of Regular Fund, 

particularly for Professional Services, Training and Scholarship Expenses and 

Representation Expenses. 

 

3.6 It has been noted that Management’s inability to properly plan and prioritize procurement 
of material projects had affected the ability of the DOT to ensure physical delivery of the 

agency’s targeted programs, projects and activities and likewise affected its budget 

utilization for CY 2020. 

 



94 

 

3.7 Verification of the DOT’s operational efficiency revealed that the DOT CO’s undisbursed 
obligation pertains to MOOE of Regular Fund, particularly advertising expenses. This 

included   obligations for the unfinished programs, projects and activities under Locally 

Funded Projects (Branding) and Market and Product Development, which involves key 

projects amounting to P534,664,346.70. These are:

3.8 Review of the Annual Procurement Plan (APP) of the DOT CO for CY 2020 disclosed that 
procurement activities of some major projects of the Branding campaign were scheduled 

to be procured on the third and fourth quarters of the year. Given that these are the primary 

projects of the DOT where most of the budget for the year have been allotted for utilization, 

Management should have considered their procurement activities for the implementation 

thereof in the first to the third quarters of the year to carry out the DOT’s deliverables 

during the year with improved budget utilization.  

 

3.9 Thus, inability to properly plan and prioritize procurement of material projects had affected 
the ability of the DOT CO to maximize its budget utilization.  

 

3.10 The same issues on the unutilized budget concerning proper planning and implementation 
of branding campaigns were incorporated in our prior year’s audit report. 

 

3.11 We recommended and Management agreed to properly plan to come up with realistic 
work plan with due consideration of the appropriate timing of procurement activities 

and prioritization of more important projects/activities, to ensure that deliverables 



95 

 

are attainable and ready for implementation upon release of funds, to maximize 

utilization of allotments and cash allocations.   

 

 

Comparison between physical targets and accomplishments 

 

4. DOT was able to meet and exceed most of its physical targets for CY 2020 
notwithstanding the unutilized budget and the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic. 

While this indicated positive results, it reflected inadequate planning and unrealistic 

setting of physical targets. 

 
4.1 A Major Final Output (MFO) implies an aggregation of smaller, like-for-like outputs 

grouped together into an MFO. Each MFO should reflect a core output, deliverable, or 

business line of the agency, and will typically comprise a grouping of programs, activities 

and projects (PAPs) undertaken with a common sector outcome in mind. MFO is the good 

or service that an agency is mandated to deliver to external clients through the 

implementation of PAPs. 

 

4.2 In relation thereto, physical accomplishments of each government agency are monitored 
and analyzed to help decision makers to assess where the agency is strong, where it is 

weaker and factors they can change for the better. Assessing the agency’s output is 

necessary to ensure that the agency’s operation is toward the attainment of a certain long-

term impact or objective.

4.4 It can be gleaned from the above schedule that Management was able to meet and has 
exceeded some of its physical targets for CY 2020 notwithstanding the unutilized budget 

and prevailing COVID-19 pandemic.  DOT has created alternative mechanisms to adjust 

in the new normal and mitigate the effects of the current pandemic in its operations by 

maximizing the use of virtual platforms. 

 

4.5 However, it was observed that there are targets for CY2020 that are set way below the 
actual accomplishments already obtained by the Department in CY 2019. Thus, the over 

accomplishments could have been an indication that the target may no longer be 

commensurate to the Department’s current absorptive capacity. In general, target should 

be based on realistic assumptions and the current environment. Thus, assessing the 

Department’s over performance may mislead decision makers.  

 

4.6 To cite an instance, it could be observed that in CY 2020, the actual numbers of trained 
LGUs totaled 7,101 thereby exceeding its target of 3,878 LGUs by 3,223 more. But in CY 

2019, the Department had already obtained a total of 8,556 number of LGUs trained. 

Hence, while the Department exceeded its target, it could be noted that the Department’s 

reported accomplishment of 7,101 number of trained LGUs for CY 2020 is notably lower 

as compared with the CY2019 accomplishments of 8,556.  

 

4.7 Likewise, the physical output accomplishment on the number of products developed and 
product partners engaged in CY 2019 totaled 2,599 but the Department targeted for only 



99 

 

365 in CY 2020. While the accomplishment of 960 appears to have exceeded the target of 

365, it can also be interpreted as under performance as it is way below the actual 

accomplishment in CY 2019 which totaled to 2,599.  

 

4.8 Thus, inability of the persons responsible to consider benchmarking from the actual 
accomplishments of prior years resulted to preparation of unrealistic or impractical 

physical targets. Likewise, this may provide unrealistic basis for the Management when 

assessing whether the DOT is performing efficiently and improving over the years. 
 

4.9 We recommended that Management formulate realistic physical targets based on 
prior years’ performance and within the current absorptive capacity of the agency 

while maximizing available resources.  

 

4.10 The Management of DOT CO justified that due to the pandemic wherein face-to-face 
trainings, seminars and meetings were not allowed, delivery units of the DOT resorted to 

virtual platforms in the implementation of some Programs, Activities and Projects (PAPs), 

which reduced the cost of PAP implementation as compared to conducting physical 

trainings, seminars and meetings.  

 

4.11 It was further clarified that in preparing the targets for FY 2020, the Management used FY 
2018 as baseline since it is prepared in the first semester of FY 2019. Also, the delivery 

unit concerned advised that the 2019 accomplishment showed new pool of partners 

identified that will be maintained and engaged in 2020. Thus, a lower target for new 

partners engaged and products developed for 2020 were targeted since results from product 

development/enhancement take more than a year to realize.  

 

4.12 Nonetheless, the Management committed to reiterate to the delivery units the formulation 
of realistic physical targets. In addition, through the Planning Service, Management will 

provide coaching and mentoring on the formulation of physical targets. 

     

 

Bank balances for remittance to BTr - P4,653,578.21 

 

5. Accumulated funds of P4,653,578.21 collected from the proceeds of sale of bidding 
documents from CYs 2015 to 2020 have not been reverted to the Bureau of the 

Treasury (BTr) after payment of outstanding honoraria and overtime pay of the Bids 

and Awards Committee (BAC) members, to allow the government the use of such 

funds for other projects or purposes. Moreover, other dormant cash and unnecessary 

trust funds from all sources have not been determined in the absence of detailed 

breakdown by source of the CIB-LCCA RT account.     

 

5.1 DOF-DBM-COA Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 
2012 provides the rules and regulations implementing EO No. 431 dated May 30, 2005, 

directing the reversion to the General Fund of all dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, 

unnecessary special and trust funds and related accounts. Furthermore, Section 3.0 of COA 



100 

 

Circular No. 2015-001 dated January 20, 2015 provides the procedural guidelines in the 

reversion thereof. 

 

5.2 Item 6.2 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005 (as amended by 
Budget Circular No. 2007-3 dated November 29, 2007) provides that “Pursuant to the 

DOF-DBM-COA Permanent Committee Resolution No. 2005-2 dated June 2005, all 

agencies are authorized to treat the collections from the sources identified in item 6.1 hereof 

as trust receipts to be used as exclusively for the payment of honoraria and overtime pay 

herein authorized. Agencies may utilize up to one hundred percent (100%) of the said 

collections for the payment of honoraria and overtime pay subject to the guidelines in item 

5.0 of this Circular. Any excess in the amount collected shall be remitted by NGAs to the 

Bureau of the Treasury.”  

 

5.3 Verification of the CIB-LCCA RT account of DOT CO revealed that collections from 
proceeds of sale of bidding documents of BAC from CY 2015 to CY 2020 amounting to 

P4,653,578.21 remain intact in the said regular trust account and unremitted to the BTr.  

 

5.4 It was further noted that the Management did not release any honorarium to the BAC 
Members in CY 2020 although there were awarded procurements such as Consulting 

Services of a Media Planning and Placement Agency for the Philippine Tourism Branding 

for Opportunity and Emerging Markets with contract price of P300,000,000.00 and 

Consulting Services for the Consumer Insights Survey of Target Markets with contract 

price of P199,999,996.80. Management informed that the cash advances for the payment 

of honoraria of BAC Members were not granted to the payroll head since his eligibility 

documents as Special Disbursing Officer were still on process. Thus, after considering the 

unpaid honoraria and overtime, the excess funds from the collected proceeds of sale of 

bidding documents should have been immediately remitted to the BTr. 

 

5.5 It could be emphasized that the CIB-LCCA RT account as mentioned in the previous 
paragraphs has no SLs to provide for the breakdown of the various trust receipts by source 

and purpose which constrained the Audit Team to establish dormant cash and unnecessary 

trust funds or receipts that should be remitted to the BTr.  

 

5.6 Non-remittance of unnecessary bank balances to the BTr does not only violate the above 
cited provisions but also denies the government of the benefit of using such funds for other 

government programs or projects.  

 

5.7 We recommended and Management agreed to require the DOT CO Accountant to:  
 

a. immediately remit to the BTr the excess funds from the sale of bid documents 
after the payment of honorarium intended for members of the BAC and the 

support staff, in compliance with Item 6.2 of DBM Circular No. 2004-5A; and  

 

b. establish the composition of the CIB-LCCA RT account to determine all dormant 
cash and unnecessary trust funds that should be remitted to the BTr. 

 



101 

 

Absence of authority to maintain LCCA Bank Account  

 

6. Absence of confirmatory authority from the BTr for the DOT’s maintained LCCA 
renders the bank accounts of doubtful legal validity or maintenance thereof is 

contrary to the requirements of Treasury Circular No. 02-2014 dated June 16, 2014. 

 

6.1 EO No. 55 series of 2011 on the Directing the Integration and Automation of Government 
Financial Management Systems mandates the establishment of a Treasury Single Account 

(TSA) System for a more effective way of cash management and rationalizing agency bank 

accounts.  

 

6.2 Section 3 of Treasury Circular No. 02-2014 dated June 16, 2014 provides the procedure 
for opening of Bank Account of National Government Agencies (NGA) as follows: 

 

“3.1 The Head of Agency or Authorized Representative shall: 

 

3.1.1 Submit letter request to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) Regional Office in the 

area where the agency is located, supported by the information stated in the Request for 

Authority to Open Bank Account (BTr Form 1) 

 

3.1.2 Submit the Undertaking in the form of BTr Form 2. 

 

3.2 The BTr Regional Director shall evaluate and review the purpose and legal basis to 

open the account and completeness of the requirements as stated in Section 3.1.1 

 

3.3 The Treasurer of the Philippines through the BTr Regional Director shall communicate 

to the government agency the action taken on the request.” 

 

6.3 Prior year’s report disclosed that the Management of DOT CO could not support the 
existing LCCA with valid authority from the BTr or appropriate legal bases. The DOT CO 

Management justified that the LCCA is maintained based on the following issuances:

6.4 However, the justification provided by the Management may no longer be acceptable due 
to the issuance of the EO No. 55 s. 2011 which implements the TSA System. In the case 

of the National Parks Development Committee (NPDC), an attached government agency 

of the DOT, they have coordinated and clarified with the BTr the validity of all their 

existing LCCAs. The DOT CO should also coordinate with the BTr by submitting the list 

of their existing LCCAs for their evaluation and concurrence on their validity. 

 

6.5 It was also noted that the DOT CO’s LCCA includes 2 dormant accounts and a payroll 
fund account. However, the BTr discourages maintaining these LCCAs pursuant to EO No. 

55 s. 2011 and instead recommends the use of the LBP Financial Data Entry System 

(FinDES) which allows the direct crediting of payroll funds from the agency MDS Account 

through LDDAP-ADA to the ATM account of its employees. Thus, maintenance of these 

dormant and payroll LCCA by the DOT is deemed no longer necessary. 

 

6.6 In DOT NCR, review of the bank accounts showed that as of audit date, the LBP with 
account no. 2005-9027-30 maintained by the agency remained inactive or dormant for 

more than five (5) years. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that Management has been 

exerting their efforts to enforce the closure of the account by sending request letter to the 

bank. The non-closure of the said bank account may open opportunities to unauthorized 

transfer of funds from one bank account to another and entails unnecessary utilization of 

government resources which is not a sound management and fiscal administration practice. 

 

6.7 Nonetheless, the Audit Team is in the position that EO No. 55 series of 2011 must be 
followed. Unless the BTr provides authority to maintain these LCCA bank accounts, these 

accounts are considered unnecessary and should be reverted to the BTr account. 

 

6.8 We recommended that Management:  
 

a. coordinate with the BTr to clarify the validity of maintaining the LCCAs; 
 

b. immediately cause the reversion of balances of LCCAs that are no longer necessary 
to the BTr; and  



103 

 

 

c. for the Regular Trust Account, Management shall establish the validity and 
purpose of fund transfers balances from the source agency/ies to ensure delivery 

of the funds purpose and return any unused and unnecessary funds, if any.  

 

6.9 The DOT CO Management commented that they have already instructed the Accounting 
Division to scrutinize the CIB-LCCA balances, revert excess cash balances to the BTr, and 

close the bank accounts that are deemed not necessary to maintain. 

 

6.10 The DOT NCR Management commented that preparation and submission of necessary 
documents are ongoing to close the said inactive bank account. Follow-up on the status of 

the closure of the bank account was also made. All unused/obsolete checks were already 

turned-over to COA.  

 

 

Unliquidated Fund Transfers to NGAs, LGUs, ROs and NGOs/POs 

 

7. The Due from NGAs, LGUs, ROs and NGOs/POs accounts balances accumulated to 
P483,785,105.04 as of December 31, 2020, of which P426,883,461.60 or 88 percent 

remained unliquidated for over one year to over five years due to laxity of 

Management in enforcing the liquidation of fund transfers by the Implementing 

Agencies concerned. 

 

7.1 COA Circular Nos. 2012-001, 2007-001 and 94-013 dated June 14, 2012, October 25, 2007 
and December 13, 1994, respectively, and the covering MOA executed by the DOT and 

the IA/unit provided the documentary requirements for the fund transfers, the period of 

submission of liquidation/disbursements reports and the return of any unused amount of 

the fund transfer to the source agency (SA).  

 

7.2 Section 5.3 of COA Circular No. 94-013 states that the SA shall require the Implementing 
Agencies to submit the reports such as report of checks issued and/or report of 

disbursements to take up expenditures for the said project.

 Total unliquidated for over 1 to over 5 years  426,883,461.60 

 

7.4 It can be observed that P426,883,461.00 or 88 percent of the ending balance remained 
outstanding for one year to over five years due to non-liquidation by the Implementing 

Agencies of the funds transferred to them despite completion mostly of the listed projects. 



105 

 

The non-liquidation of the funds resulted in non-recognition in the books of DOT of the 

relative assets and/or expenses made therefrom and non-refund of any remaining balance. 

 

7.5 Inquiry with the Accounting Division disclosed that the unliquidated fund transfers are 
attributable to late submission of liquidation reports due to completion of required 

supporting documents by the Implementing Agencies/NGOs concerned. In addition, 

necessary documents supporting the fund transfers to recipient agencies, which remained 

unliquidated for 10 years and more, are no longer available. The foregoing noted 

observations resulted in the difficulty of ascertaining the proper utilization of funds and 

casted doubts on the reliability of the accounts. Further, actual expenses were not reported 

in the year they were incurred affecting the presentation of the financial statements. 

 

7.6 Management has already sent demand letters in CY 2020 to the NGAs, LGUs and 
NGOs/People’s Organizations (PO) concerned and coordinated with the DOT ROs with 

outstanding balances. Also, they have designated some staff to secure credible 

documentary evidence per project but certain issues and concerns were encountered which 

they believed were beyond their control such as, series of changes in the management and 

leadership including staff turnovers in the LGUs, strenuous document search and observed 

deficiency in record keeping or transfer of accountabilities. However, despite the efforts 

exerted by the Accounting Division, the problem on the significant prior years’ long 

outstanding fund transfers remained unresolved. 
 

7.7 The lack of monitoring in prior years’ submission of the liquidation reports, especially on 
those finished/completed projects, and the lack of proper coordination with the recipient 

Implementing Agencies/LGUs/NGOs/POs on the refund of the unexpended balance of the 

fund transfers resulted in the accumulation of the long outstanding balances of the 

transferred funds. 
 

7.8 In view of Management’s inability to strictly enforce full accounting and settlement of 
these fund releases, the actual expenditures are not reported and recorded in the books in a 

timely manner. This gives an impression to the users of the Financial Statements that 

projects were not implemented as designed to benefit the general public.  

 

7.9 Considering the significance of the accumulated fund transfers, the non-reversion of any 
unused fund transfers had deprived the government of using the amounts for other projects 

or purposes. 

 

7.10 We recommended and Management agreed to: 
 

a. continuously send demand letters and/or make representation/proper 
coordination with the heads or project officers of the Implementing 

Agencies/NGOs/POs/LGUs/NGAs concerned to compel them to immediately 

submit their liquidation reports and to settle/refund any unutilized balance of the 

transferred funds to DOT so that the necessary adjusting entries to account for 

the liquidation of the projects involved can be made and effected; and 

 



106 

 

b. evaluate the status of long outstanding and dormant fund transfers due from 
various Implementing Agencies/NGOs/POs and determine whether these 

advances can be requested for write off in accordance with COA Circular No. 

2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. 

 

7.11 Management from the DOT CO commented that they have instructed the Accounting 
Division to continuously send demand letters to the Implementing Agencies/NGOs/POs 

concerned for immediate submission of liquidation reports, and settlement/refund of any 

unutilized balance. They further commented that the evaluation of the status of long 

outstanding and dormant fund transfers has actually been initiated by the Supervising 

Accountant but was held in abeyance when she retired from the government service last 

year. Hence, the Chief Accountant shall assign another staff to handle this and re-evaluate 

the status of long outstanding and dormant fund transfers and request for write-off, 

whenever applicable. 

 

 

Non-recognition of the Iloilo Convention Center (ICC) 

 

8. The Iloilo Convention Center (ICC) building which was built on the land donated to 
the DOT remains not recognized in their books despite being completely constructed 

and fully operational due to inability of the Management to coordinate with TIEZA 

and DPWH. 

 

8.1 On November 13, 2012, a Deed of Donation (DOD) has been made and executed by 
Megaworld Corporation in favor of the DOT in which a parcel of land located in Iloilo City 

was donated to the latter.   

 

8.2 In consideration of the donor’s liberality and desire to assist the DOT in its efforts to 
develop and spur tourism growth, Megaworld Corporation donated the land subject to 

several terms and conditions such as: 

 

 The property shall be used for the sole purpose of the construction and development of 
the ICC; 

 The donation shall remain effective so long as the property is used exclusively as the 
site of the ICC, which will be utilized for the purpose of holding large-scale events, 

international fairs and conventions, congresses, expositions and the like; and 

 In the event that the DOT fails, through its fault or negligence, to discharge any, some 
or all of its undertakings in the Deed, the donor, at its sole option, reserves the right to 

rescind the DOD.  

 

8.3 The said DOD stipulated, among others, the following responsibilities of the DOT as a 
Donee: 

 

 Earmark, raise and/or appropriate, through the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise 
Zone Authority (TIEZA) and/or available government funding, and in accordance with 



107 

 

applicable Philippine laws, P200,000,000.00 for the construction and development of 

ICC within 2 years from the time the Deed takes effect. 

 Undertake, or cause to undertake through another government agency, the construction 
and development of ICC, in accordance with the proposed conceptual design of the 

Donor and applicable laws and regulations. 

 Offer to public, either directly or through another government agency the Operation 
and Maintenance of ICC in accordance with government procurement laws and 

regulations. 

 Supervise and monitor, by itself or through a qualified operator such activities and 
utilization of the ICC and to ensure that its facilities are used exclusively to attract, 

promote, facilitate and service large scale events, international fairs and conventions, 

congresses, expositions and the like. 

 Supervise, monitor and endeavor by itself or through another government agency, the 
completion of the construction and development of the ICC. 

 

8.4 To comply with the DOD, the DOT executed a MOA with TIEZA on April 16, 2013 stating 
the following conditions: 

 

 Through a valid board resolution, TIEZA shall allocate the amount of P200,000,000.00 
for the construction and development of ICC. 

 TIEZA shall ensure that the entity who will be awarded with the operation and 
management of the center after compliance with the relevant government procurement 

laws and regulations, shall faithfully observe, follow and conform with the exclusive 

use of the property as convention center. 

 TIEZA or through qualified operator who will be awarded with the operation and 
management of the center shall supervise and monitor the activities and utilization of 

ICC to ensure that its facilities are used exclusively to attract, promote, facilitate and 

service large scale events, international fairs and conventions, congresses, expositions 

and the like. 

 TIEZA shall coordinate with the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) 
and execute the necessary agreement for the construction and development of ICC in 

accordance with the design plan approved by the DOT and the donor, Megaworld, 

subject to legal easements and restrictions under Iloilo Business Park Restrictions. 

 All income generated from the operation and management of ICC shall accrue to 
TIEZA, subject to the appropriate government accounting and auditing procedures. 

 

8.5 Analysis of the above provisions, the DOT has the primary responsibility to oversee, 
supervise and monitor all activities relating to the construction of the ICC and the operation 

thereof. The MOA between the DOT and TIEZA is evaluated to be a mere delegation of 

duties and responsibilities of the DOT to TIEZA which is allowed by the provisions in the 

DOD. As such, the control and ownership of the property as well as the responsibility to 

ensure that the provisions of the DOD is being enforced, still rest with the DOT. 

 

8.6 On April 27, 2015, the DOT and TIEZA executed another MOA with the following 
provisions:  

 



108 

 

DOT: 

 

 DOT gives TIEZA full rights and possession to use the ICC and all other improvements 
on the ICC for the purpose of operating and managing it by itself or through public 

bidding. By virtue of which, TIEZA shall have the right to secure all necessary and 

required permits to operate and manage the ICC, without need of authority from the 

DOT. 

 

TIEZA: 

 

 TIEZA recognizes the absolute ownership of the DOT over the lot registered as 
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 095-2014003271 and the improvement constructed on 

the said lot, i.e. ICC. 

 TIEZA shall provide the necessary resources, subject to existing laws, rules and 
regulations for the purpose of making the ICC operational, while it is still in the process 

of procuring a long-term qualified operator for the ICC. 

 TIEZA shall maintain, manage, operate and administer the subject property as well as 
all the buildings, improvements, and implements that shall be introduced thereon. 

 As the operator and manager of the ICC, TIEZA has the right to introduce additional 
investments to and improvements on the ICC, including putting in additional furniture, 

fixtures and equipment to ensure optimum operation and maintenance of the ICC. Any 

improvements introduced by the TIEZA shall be recognized as TIEZA’s assets in its 

books of accounts. 

 For the purpose of defraying the costs and expenses for the maintenance, operation, 
upkeep and improvement of the ICC, as well as the costs of the annual real property 

taxes and other assessments on the subject property and improvements made, TIEZA 

may impose and collect such appropriate and reasonable fees and charges from parties, 

public or private, utilizing ICC and its facilities. 

 TIEZA shall account or disclose its full rights and possession to use the ICC as an 
asset in its book of accounts, subject to government accounting and auditing 

procedures to justify all budgetary allocation and disbursements. (Emphasis ours) 

 

8.7 The new MOA allows TIEZA to operate and manage the ICC or supervise the operation 
and management by a private entity, in an effective and efficient manner and in order to 

enforce the rights of an owner over ICC. 

 

8.8 However, considering that the donation made by Megaworld Corporation to DOT is 
revocable once the DOT failed, through its fault or negligence, to discharge any, some or 

all of its undertakings/responsibilities, transferring the full rights and possession to use the 

ICC as an asset in the books of accounts of TIEZA is in conflict to the said DOD. 

Considering the condition of the donation, the land as well as the ICC should be in full 

control of the DOT in order to properly execute the agreements within the DOD.  

 

8.9 It can be observed that even the MOA itself has stipulated contradicting provisions since it 
stated that TIEZA recognizes the absolute ownership of the DOT over the lot and the 

improvement thereon when it also provides that TIEZA shall be the one to account for ICC 



109 

 

as an asset in its books. Also, the provision of transferring full rights and possession of the 

ICC to TIEZA is considered not beneficial on the part of the National Government.  

 

8.10 In view of this, the DOT, having the absolute ownership and control despite the execution 
of the latest MOA with TIEZA, should recognize ICC in their books, upon completion of 

the construction, considering that the said building qualifies in the PPE recognition 

requisites stated in Section 3, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I, which provides 

that – “The cost of an item of PPE shall be recognized as asset, if, and only if: 

 

a. it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential associated with the 
item will flow to the entity;   

b. the cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably;  
c. beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the government;  
d. the asset is used to achieve government objectives; and; 
e. it meets the capitalization threshold of P15,000.” 

 

8.11 Moreover, inquiry with the Auditor of TIEZA revealed that the construction of the ICC 
building is already completed and has been operating for almost five (5) years and that the 

construction of the building was procured and implemented by the DPWH. The Audit 

Team was also informed that the additional procurement costs on top of the P200 million 

transferred by TIEZA were said to be taken from the appropriation of DPWH and the actual 

total cost of constructing the building was not known by TIEZA.  

 

8.12 Considering that the construction was already completed and that it has already been fully 
operating, the building should have been turned over to the DOT for recognition in their 

books as an asset. However, due to lack of supervision and coordination of the DOT 

Management with TIEZA and the DPWH, the said PPE remained unrecorded as of this 

date.  

 

8.13 As included in the CY 2019 Annual Audit Report (AAR) of DOT, the Audit Team 
recommended to the Management to revisit and review the provisions of the executed 

agreements/contracts with TIEZA and make revisions thereon, if necessary, to eliminate 

contradicting/conflicting stipulations and to ensure that conditions are in consonance with 

the DOD and are beneficial to the National Government. We also recommended that the 

DOT Management coordinate with the Management of TIEZA and DPWH to initiate 

proper turnover of the ICC building to their possession. However, said recommendations 

are still unimplemented as of the audit date. 

 

8.14 According to the submitted Agency Action Plan and Status of Implementation (AAPSI) on 
the COA’s audit observations and recommendations, the review of the provisions of the 

pertinent contracts being undertaken by the Legal Affairs Service (LAS) is still ongoing. 

Hence, any revision in the stipulations of the contracts have yet to be effected therein. 

Likewise, although Management has considered coordinating or setting a meeting with 

TIEZA and DPWH to discuss matters regarding the ICC building, this has not materialized. 

It is allegedly due to the setbacks brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 



110 

 

8.15 The inability of the DOT Management to initiate or to require the TIEZA and the DPWH 
to account and process the proper turn-over of the ICC building resulted in the non-

recognition of fully constructed PPE in the books of accounts of DOT. Also, the interest of 

the National Government on the subject DOD may not be duly protected.  

 

8.16 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. facilitate the review of the provisions of the executed agreements/contracts with 
TIEZA to make necessary revisions thereon, if warranted, and eliminate 

contradicting/conflicting stipulations to ensure that conditions are in consonance 

with the DOD and are beneficial to the National Government; and 

 

b. coordinate with the Management of TIEZA and DPWH to initiate proper 
turnover of the ICC building to their possession. 

 

8.17 The Management commented that upon review of the provisions of the executed 
agreements/contracts with TIEZA, DOT’s LAS believes that there is no conflict between 

the DOD and the DOT-TIEZA MOA. The DOD states that the DOT may supervise the 

activities and utilization of the ICC by itself or through a qualified operator, which in this 

case, is TIEZA. Accordingly, there is no need to amend the MOA. Pursuant to Section 

6.3.e.2 and Section 7.3.d.1 of COA Circular No. 2017-004, which was derived from IPSAS 

17 PPE, it was noted that TIEZA may book up the cost and depreciation of the ICC. The 

DOT Accounting Division has disclosed in the DOT’s Financial Statements that the ICC 

will be taken up by TIEZA in its books as being a property owned by the DOT but under 

TIEZA’s control and possession. 

 

8.18 During the exit conference, the Management has expressed their understanding on the 
recommendation of the Audit Team and committed to coordinate with TIEZA and DPWH 

as soon as possible. 

 

Auditor’s rejoinder: 

 

8.19 The Audit Team believes that although monitoring and supervision of the ICC may be 
delegated, the role of the DOT in monitoring and supervising the ICC is indispensable and 

should be recognized. It is the responsibility of the DOT to ensure that the provisions in 

the DOD is being fulfilled. Also, the DOT upon entering into an agreement, should take 

into consideration that aside from the funds given by TIEZA, the National Government 

also expended material amount through the DPWH. Thus, DOT should consider taking 

part in any income that could be obtained from using the asset.  

 

8.20 Likewise, while the DOT opined that the Building could be recognized in the books of 
TIEZA, The Audit Team maintains its stand that the DOT should take the initiative to 

transfer the completed asset from the books of DPWH to avoid any further 

difficulties/problems.

Lapses in grant and liquidation of Cash Advances 

 

9. Management did not strictly observe the rules and regulations in the grant and 
liquidation of cash advances pursuant to COA Circular No. 97-002 and DOT 

Department Order (DO) No. 2013-08 thereby resulting in the accumulation of the 

unsettled/unliquidated cash advances as of December 31, 2020 amounting to 

P333,847,658.71. Of this amount, P308,791,169.94 or 92 percent remained unsettled 

for more than 90 days to more than 2 years, hence already past due for liquidation. 

In addition, existence of long outstanding and dormant cash advances totaling 

P6,009,534.47 due from DOT officers who are already retired/resigned or can no 

longer be traced were also noted.  

 

a) Unsettled/unliquidated cash advances for more than 90 days to more than 2 years 

 

9.1 Section 4.1.3 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997 provides that “a cash 
advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given 

has been served.  No additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee 

unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof 

is made”. 

 

9.2 Section 1.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 provides the general 
guidelines that “the accountable officer shall liquidate cash advances within the following 

period: Travelling Expenses – within 30 days after the return of the official/employee 

concerned to his official station for local travel and within 60 days after the return of the 

official/employee concerned to the Philippines in case of foreign travel.” 

 

9.3 DOT DO No. 2013-08 dated April 30, 2013 provides the updated Operations Manual for 
the Foreign Offices of the Department of Tourism (DOT). Section 34 of the said Manual 

states that “the cash advance for the first two (2) months shall be liquidated on the first 

month of the following quarter, while that of the third month of the quarter shall be 

liquidated together with the first two months of the succeeding quarter.” The AO shall carry 

out the major responsibility for the liquidation, to be validated and approved by the 

Tourism Attaché.” 

 

9.4 The reported balance of cash advances accounts of the DOT CO and ROs amounting to 
P333,847,658.71 as of December 31, 2020 is broken down as follows:

9.7 The Audit Team observed that the accumulated balance of past due accounts of PTOs is 
mainly attributable to the continued practice of granting additional cash advance despite 

previous existing unsettled cash accountabilities; and the late submission and processing 

of liquidation reports together with the required supporting documents. 

 

9.8 It was also pointed out that the AO of PDOT – Osaka, Japan, with outstanding balance of 
P1,329,547.94, is no longer connected with the DOT having already resigned without 

processing clearance. Management informed that a demand letter has been prepared to be 

immediately sent upon knowing her current address. 

 

9.9 Management, on the other hand, explained that additional cash advances were issued 
despite outstanding balances to avoid interruption on PTOs’ operations caused by 

insufficiency of funds. Whereas, although the processing of liquidation documents for this 

year was greatly affected by work restrictions brought about by COVID-19 pandemic, 

several liquidation reports were already submitted but still subject for evaluation by the 

Accounting Division. 

 

9.10 The Audit Team also acknowledged the following comments and actions of Management 
to address the large amount of unliquidated cash advances: 

 

a. The Accounting Division designated an employee to monitor the cash advances issued 
to PDOT Offices. Reports on cash advances and liquidation were prepared regularly 

to monitor the status of outstanding balances. They are frequently sending reminders 

through e-mail to all PDOT offices to liquidate their cash advances within the 

prescribed period. 

 

b. The Legal Affairs Service is frequently sending demand letters to former DOT 
personnel to settle their balances within 15 days upon receipt of the letter.  

 

c. No more additional cash advances for special projects shall be released unless their 
previous cash advances were liquidated and have recommended the withholding of the 

salaries of those AOs who failed to timely liquidate their cash advances.  



114 

 

 

9.11 Considering the significant amount of past due unliquidated cash advances, the non-
liquidation of prior years’ cash advances does not only violate the above provisions but 

also implies the Management’s inadequate monitoring controls to ensure the timely 

submission by the AOs of their liquidation of accountabilities. The inability of the 

Management to come up with alternative controls further renders the funds susceptible to 

risk of loss, theft and/or misuse which runs counter to the objectives of Management’s 

fiscal responsibility.  

 

9.12 We reiterate our prior year’s recommendations that Management: 
 

a. issue final demand letters to the concerned AOs and Tourism Attachés to 
immediately submit their liquidation reports and/or return unused long 

outstanding cash advances, else, impose necessary administrative sanctions in 

accordance with PDOT’s Manual of Operations and other applicable laws, rules 

and regulations;  

 

b. send the demand letter to the current or last known address of the AO of PDOT – 
Osaka for the immediate settlement of her outstanding accountabilities, otherwise, 

execute any legal remedy to recover the amount; and 

 

c. strengthen the monitoring controls on the grant and liquidation of cash advances 
by strictly complying with the provisions of Sections 4.1.3 and 5.7 of COA Circular 

No. 97-002, and DO No. 2013-08 dated April 30, 2013 re: Operations Manual for 

the Foreign Offices of the DOT in the liquidations and/or refund of their cash 

advances.  

 

b) Long-outstanding and dormant cash advances 

 

9.13 Out of the total unliquidated balance in Advances account, the net amount of P6,009,534.47 
has remained unliquidated for over three (3) years to over thirty-three (33) years. 

Verification of records disclosed that the accountable officers concerned had already 

retired/resigned from the service, or can no longer be traced. Details are shown below:

9.14 Inquiry with the Management disclosed that the amount of P6,009,534.47 pertains to non-
moving balances of those AOs who have already retired, resigned and/or can no longer be 

traced.  

 

9.15 This could signify weakness in the internal control, laxity in the monitoring system and 
leniency on the part of the concerned office in approving clearance from money and 

property accountability despite existing unsettled cash accountability. 

 

9.16 Likewise, the DOT Management, in previous years, failed to exert extra effort in locating 
these former DOT employees or sending demand letters requiring them to settle their 

outstanding balances. 

 

9.17 Considering that this amount has been long outstanding in the books of the DOT for over 
three to almost 33 years, Management should have pursued in requesting the dormant 

balances for write-off in accordance with COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 

2016. 

 

9.18 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. exhaust all possible means to locate the whereabouts and status of 
retired/resigned officials and employees with outstanding advances which 

includes coordination with other government agencies such as the GSIS or the 

PSA, and demand that they liquidate and/or refund immediately their 

unliquidated cash advances, otherwise, execute any legal remedy to collect the 

amount; and 

 

b. initiate the request for write-off for the AOs with long outstanding balances aged 
almost 33 years, in accordance with the provisions of COA Circular No. 2016-

005 dated December 19, 2016, as applicable. 
 

9.19 The DOT CO Management provided the following comments: 
 

a. The Accounting Division will coordinate with the GSIS or PSA to find ways and 
means to locate them and demand the liquidation and/or refund of the outstanding cash 

advances.  

 

b. The request for write-off was already initiated by the former Chief Accountant who 
was then preparing the necessary documents for the application until her retirement 

from the service last November 2020. Due to lack of manpower, however, there was 

no one from FMS-AD who assumed this responsibility. Nonetheless, Management 

committed to beef up the manpower complement of the Accounting Division so the 

request for write-off shall continue/resume immediately.

Unutilized Funds for the “Mi Ciudad : Limpio Y Floriao” Project   

 

10. DOT RO IX Management was not able to fully utilize the fund amounting to 
P3,260,250.00 for the Mi Ciudad Limpio Y Floriao project with a residual amount of 

P2,019,982.75 as of December 31, 2020 which remained unutilized for more than three 

(3) years. 

 

10.1 The “Mi Ciudad : Limpio Y Floriao” project was approved and funded in August 2017 
with a total budget of P3,260,250.00.  

 

10.2 As planned, the project should have been monitored and evaluated periodically to assess 
the attainment of objectives and key result areas. Barangays are required to submit a status 

report of the project on a quarterly basis. The agency has already encountered some issues 

even during its initial implementation which implies that the project may not have been 

carefully planned for it to be successful. 
 

10.3 The Audit Team previously brought up to the Management the significant delay noted in 
the implementation, discussed the issues encountered, and recommended to Management 

to assess and carefully evaluate their capability and the things that need to be done to 

determine if it is still feasible to continue the project as originally conceptualized 

considering their available resources and the need to coordinate with the participating 

stakeholders. 

 

10.4 While there were efforts exerted by the current Management to distribute the procured 
plants and pots to the different barangays to be used in their respective areas, residual funds 

amounting to P2,019,982.75 as of December 31, 2020, have remained unutilized in the 

account of the DOT IX for more than three years reckoned from the date the amount was 

transferred for the purpose.  

 

10.5 We recommend the Management of DOT CO to require the DOT RO IX to 
immediately submit liquidation report of the fund transferred and return the 

unutilized amount to DOT CO for its’ reversion to the BTr.  

  

 

Lapses in the Collection of Fees/Income 

 

11. In DOT RO I, convention fees were collected using unauthorized customized receipts 
contrary to Section 68(1) of PD No. 1445; while related convention expenses were 

charged against the regular appropriations thereby depleting the RO’s available fund 

for regular expenses. 

 

a) Unauthorized use of customized official receipts 
 

11.1 Sec. 68(1), PD No. 1445 provides that no payment of any nature shall be received by a 
collecting officer without immediately issuing an official receipt in acknowledgement 

thereof. The receipt may be in the form of postage, internal revenue or documentary stamps 



117 

 

and the like, officially numbered receipts, subject to proper custody, accountability, and 

audit. 

 

11.2 It was observed in DOT RO I that customized receipts were issued to paying participants 
instead of the government Official Receipts/Accountable Form No. 51-C during the 

conduct of the 5th RI Tourism Convention held in Vigan City, Ilocos Sur on September 

27-29, 2018. 

 

11.3 The Convention that charged registration fee of P800 per participant was attended by a 
total of 361 participants from government and private entities, thus the DOT could have 

earned a total amount of P288,800.00 that should have been reported and accounted as 

DOT funds. 

 

11.4 The issuance of customized receipts other than the government official receipt/ 
Accountable Form No. 51-C casted doubts on the regularity of the transaction as the 

collections were not accounted as government funds contrary to Section 63 of PD No. 

1445. 

 

11.5 We recommended and Management of DOT RO I agreed to: 
 

a. use the Government Official Receipt/Accountable Form No. 51-C for all 
collections received by collecting officers to be deposited intact to the National 

Treasury; and  

 

b. require erring employees to pay the total amount of registration fees of the 361 
participants amounting to P288,800.00 less any amount already deposited.  

 

b) Related convention expenses charged against the DOT RO I’s regular appropriations  
 

11.6 Section 12 of the General Provisions of the FY 2018 GAA provides, to wit: 
 

11.7 “Sec. 12. Conduct of Seminar, Conference, Training, and Oath Taking Programs. 
Departments, bureaus, offices, and instrumentalities of the National Government, 

including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy which conduct training 

programs in relation to their mandated functions are authorized to collect seminar, 

conference, training and oath taking fees from government and private agency 

participants.” 

 

11.8 The proceeds derived from each seminar conference, training, and oath taking activities 
shall be deposited with the National Treasury as income of the General Fund pursuant to 

Section 44, Chapter 5, Book VI of E.O. No. 292. However, the agencies which do not have 

appropriation in their budgets for the purpose may use the proceeds for the conduct of the 

said seminar, conference, training and oath taking activities subject to budgeting, 

accounting and auditing rules and regulations. Any excess proceeds shall be deposited with 

the National Treasury as income of the General Fund. 

 



118 

 

11.9 The agency concerned shall, upon the conclusion of the seminar, conference, training, or 
oath taking activities submit to the DBM, either in printed form or by way of electronic 

document, a report on the fees collected and expense incurred thereon. 

 

11.10 In DOT RO I, post-audit of disbursements to cover expenses related to the conduct of the 
5th RI Tourism Convention were inappropriately charged against the regular 

appropriations of the RO under Market and Product Development Program (MPDP), 

General Administration and Support Services (GASS), Tourism Development Planning 

Program (TDPP) and Tourism Industry Training (TISP).  

 

11.11 We recommended and Management agreed to conduct further investigation and 
impose appropriate sanctions to erring officials and employees. 

 

 

Irregular, Unnecessary, Excessive, Extravagant and Unconscionable Expenditures 

 

12. Disbursements in the amount of P2,278,623.70 contravened some of the existing 
government rules and regulations or deviated from the proper standard 

process/procedures on disbursements, as defined in COA Circular No. 2012-003 

dated October 29, 2012, thus, casting doubts on the validity and propriety of the 

expenditures. 
 

12.1 Section 17, General Provisions of the GAA of CY 2018 provides that, “Government funds 
shall be utilized in accordance with the appropriation authorized for the purpose and 

comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations.” 

 

12.2 COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, provides for the updated guidelines 
for the prevention, and disallowance of Irregular, Unnecessary, Excessive, Extravagant and 

Unconscionable Expenditures. 

 

12.3 In the post audit of the DOT CO and ROs financial transactions, the following 
disbursements totaling P2,278,623.70 were found as not adhering to pertinent laws, rules 

and regulations or without observing the appropriate standards, procedures and proper 

documentation to establish their propriety and validity:

c) DOT CAR paid an amount of

seven (7) staff of the DOT CO, 

Intramuros Administration and 

TPB who were on travel to the

could have spent P12,600.00 

only, with a savings of 

P7,700.00, had EO No. 77 been 

applied. 

 

d) DOT RO I paid for the 
accommodation and meals of 28 

training participants, however, 

only 22 were able to attend the

a. submit required documents and justifications to avoid suspensions/ disallowances 
in audit; and 
 

b. henceforth, ensure compliance to COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 
2012. Also, prepare its budgetary requirements in accordance with prescribed 

standard costs, disburse funds within the budgetary ceilings and seek approval 

for the excesses, if warranted, by existing policies.  

 

 

Delayed/Non-Submission of Disbursement Supporting Documents  

 

13. Various disbursements amounting to P1,837,198.68 were not supported with 
necessary documents to establish their validity, contrary to Section 4 (6) of PD No. 

1445 and COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. 

 

13.1 Section 4 (6) of PD No. 1445 provides that claims against government funds shall be 
supported with complete documentation.  

 

13.2 COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribed the revised guidelines and 
documentary requirements for Common Government transactions.  
 

13.3 Paragraph 5.7 of CSC MC No. 18, s. 2020 dated October 15, 2020 states that “Agencies 
shall adopt a monitoring mechanism such as submission of daily/weekly accomplishment 

report/s, etc., during the implementation of the alternative work arrangements to ensure 

that public service delivery is not prejudiced.”

employees’ safety and wellness were not supported with distribution lists or 

acknowledgements from the recipients. 

Total 1,837,198.68  

 

13.5 Delayed/Non-submission of the necessary documents affects the validity and propriety of 
the disbursements made and an indication of weakness in the internal control over 

disbursements of DOT ROs.  

 

13.6 We recommended and the respective Management of DOT ROs agreed to require the 
Chief Accountants and other responsible persons/staff to submit the lacking 

documents; and ensure that payments made are properly supported with complete 

documentation pursuant to Section 4 (6) of PD No. 1445, COA Circular No.  2012-001 

dated June 14, 2012 and other pertinent rules and regulations. 

 

 

Compliance with RA No. 9184 

 

14. Certain provisions of RA No. 9184 and its Revised Implementing Rules and 
Regulations (RIRR) were not faithfully observed in the DOT ROs, casting doubts on 

the integrity of the procurement process and reasonableness of the awarded 

contracts. 

 

14.1 The table below summarizes the non-compliance with the Procurement Law by the 
respective DOT ROs:

Bayanihan Act, Terms of reference and Certificate of 

Availability of Funds. In addition, Purchase Orders 

were submitted 183 calendar days beyond the 

prescribed period, while there were also noted delays 

in the furnishing of copy of the contract agreement 

ranging from 6 to 255 calendar days. 

 

c) DOT RO XIII payments amounting to P608,450.18 

were made to various suppliers without requiring the 

CY 2020 Business Permit or an official receipt of 

renewal. 

 

CO Section 7.2 of RIRR of RA No. 9184 states 

that, “No procurement shall be undertaken 

unless it is in accordance with the approved 

APP, including approved changes thereto. 

The APP must be consistent with the duly 

approved yearly budget of the Procuring 

Entity and shall bear the approval of the 

HOPE or second-ranking official designated 

by the HOPE to act on his behalf.” 

a) Review of the Project Procurement Management Plan 

(PPMP) of the DOT CO revealed that the mode of 

procurement to be used in connection with the conduct 

of 2019 Administrative Services Year-End 

Assessment shall be Small Value Procurement (SVP). 

However, review of the BAC Resolution No. 2019-

609 dated December 18, 2019 showed that they have 

resorted to adopt the Negotiated Procurement - Lease 

of Real Property or Venue in procuring 

accommodations, meals and seminar venue for the 

participants of the 2019 Administrative Services 

Year-End Assessment. 

 

Using Negotiated Procurement – Lease of Real 

Property or Venue may have been reasonable in this 

case, as the Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC) 

of P1,173,910.00 exceeded the P1,000,000.00 

threshold for SVP and the procurement involves lease 

of venue for official use. However, in the absence of 

approved revised PPMP and APP, using this mode of 

procurement is contrary to the pertinent laws, rules 

and regulations. 

 

NCR Section 8.b.vi, Annex H provides that – “The 

BAC shall recommend to the HOPE the 

award of contract in favor of the supplier or 

contractor with the Single or Lowest 

Calculated and Responsive Quotation (for 

goods or infrastructure projects), or 

consultant with the Single or Highest Rated 

and Responsive Proposal (for consulting 

services). In case of approval, the HOPE 

shall immediately enter into contract with the 

said supplier, contractor or consultant.” 

a) Scrutiny of records of the DOT NCR showed that three 

(3) suppliers were not the Lowest Calculated 

Quotations, nevertheless, the contract was awarded to 

them contrary to Section 8.b.vi of Annex H of RIRR of 

RA 9184. 

 

Inquiry from the Management disclosed that the BAC 

decided to rely on the capability and work history of 

the suppliers. However, the BAC Resolution 

recommending the award or evaluation report was not 

submitted as attachment to the POs to support the BAC

 decision, hence, the legality, validity and propriety of 

the transactions were doubtful. 

 

I Appendix A of Annex “H” mandates the 

BAC to require from bidders participating in 

alternative methods of procurement (except 

for Repeat Order, Shopping under Section 

52.1[a], Negotiated Procurement under 

Sections 53.1 [Two-Failed Biddings], and 

53.5 [Agency-to-Agency]) of the IRR of RA 

No. 9184 the documents necessary to 

establish their legal, technical and financial 

capabilities. It is further provided in the said 

portion of the revised IRR that the BAC shall 

indicate in the Request for Quotation (RFQ) 

or Request for Proposal (RFP) the stage of 

the procurement process these requirements 

must be submitted, i.e., submission of 

offer/s, evaluation of offer/s, before issuance 

of Notice of Award or prior to payment 

Appendix A of Annex “H” also provides 

documentary requirements to establish the 

technical, legal and financial capability of 

contractors to participate in the alternative 

methods of procurement. For the lease of 

Real Property or Venue, contractors are 

required to submit the following documents: 

 

1. Mayor’s/Business Permit 

2. PhilGEPS Registration No. 

3. Income Tax Return 

a) The inability of the BAC to conduct careful evaluation 

of the submitted documentary requirements of bidders 

for the procurement of projects undertaken through 

Negotiated Procurement-Small Value resulted in 

awarding and payment of contract to 

suppliers/contractors whose legal capabilities to enter 

into contract were not duly established due to non-

submission of complete documents required under 

Appendix A of Annex "H" of the revised 

Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 

9184.  

 

Contracts were awarded and paid to 

suppliers/contractors who have not submitted 

complete legal/mandatory documents. Though said 

documents were specified in the RFQ sent by the 

Agency, the stage as to when these will be complied 

with by the bidders was not indicated. Moreover, the 

submission of these documents was even disregarded 

by the winning bidders. These noted deficiencies run 

counter with the requirements which raise doubts on 

the legal capability of the winning bidder to enter into 

contract with the DOT RO I. 

b) DOT RO 1 entered into a contract with the Lessor who 

offered the lowest quotation for a period of three 

months ending December 2019. Review of the 

supporting documents showed that all three 

prospective lessors were not qualified as they were not 

registered with PhilGEPS and had no 

Mayor’s/Business Permit.  In January 2020, the 

Agency renewed their lease agreement with the same 

ineligible lessor for a period of one year. 

 

 XIII Section 54.3 requires that, “In all instances 

of alternative methods of procurement, the 

BAC, through the Secretariat, shall post, for 

information purposes, the notice of award, 

contract or purchase order, including notice 

to proceed if necessary, in the PhilGEPS 

website, the website of the Procuring Entity 

concerned, if available, and at any 

conspicuous place reserved for this purpose 

in the premises of the Procuring Entity, 

except for contracts with ABC of Fifty 

Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) and below”. 

 

a) DOT RO XIII purchase orders and contracts on 

procurement transactions amounting to P636,850.18 

undertaken through Negotiated Procurement under 

Emergency Cases and Direct Contracting were not 

posted in the PhilGEPS.

RA No. 9184 and its RIRR 
Observations 

I, X Section 8.b.ii of the 2016 Revised IRR of RA 

No. 9184 provides – “The BAC shall prepare 

and send the RFQs/RFPs to at least three (3) 

suppliers, contractors or consultants of 

known qualifications. This, notwithstanding, 

those who responded through any of the 

required postings shall be allowed to 

participate. Receipt of at least one (1) 

quotation is sufficient to proceed with the 

evaluation thereof.” 

 

a) Catering services for the 2nd Northern Luzon B2B on 

October 12, 2019 in Lingayen, Pangasinan with total 

contract price of P207,000.00 showed that the DOT 

RO I sent RFQs to two (2) suppliers only, instead of 

three (3) as required. The BAC Resolution and 

Abstract of Quotations indicate that RFQs were sent 

only to two suppliers and were submitted for 

evaluation, thus, the Agency did not avail of the lowest 

quotation from at least three (3) PhilGEPS registered 

suppliers.  

 

b) DOT RO X undertook two small value procurements 

for management fee/honorarium for two months’ 

period for the Hot Air Balloon Festival 2020. The three 

canvass proposals submitted to the BAC show the 

disparity of the first two proposals amounting to 

P380,000.00 and P150,000.00, against the third 

proposals amounting to P40,000.00. 

 

The ABC was only P80,000 for two months which 

ultimately favored the bidder with P40,000 proposals. 

Had the bidders with high bids had prior knowledge of 

the ABC and of the revised terms, they could have 

either declined the Request for Quotations/Proposals 

or sent new proposals. 

 

14.2 Transactions which fail to follow or violate appropriate established rules, regulations or 
procedural guidelines are considered irregular and could be subject to audit disallowance 

as provided under COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012. 

 

14.3 We recommended that Management instruct the DOT CO and ROs concerned to: 
 

a. strictly adhere to the provisions of RA No. 9184 and its RIRR in all stages of the 
procurement of goods and services to ensure transparency, competitiveness and 

economy in the procurement process; and 

 

b. submit the required lacking documents to facilitate further review and 
evaluation of the contracts and to avoid any suspensions and/or disallowance in 

audit.

Compliance with Other Government Laws, Rules and Regulations (LRRs) 

 

15. Below is the DOT’s status of compliance with other laws, rules and regulations: 
 

LRRs Observations and Recommendations 

Gender and Development (GAD) 

Section 31 of RA No. 11465 or 

otherwise known as the GAA of FY 

2020 and the Philippine 

Commission on Women-National 

Economic Development Authority-

Department of Budget and 

Management (PCW-NEDA-DBM) 

Joint Circular No. 2012-01 require, 

among others, all agencies of the 

government to integrate GAD Plan 

in the regular activities of the 

agencies and allocate at least five 

percent (5%) of their budgets. 

 

Section 5 of COA Circular No. 

2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 

provides that the audited agency 

shall submit a copy of the Annual 

GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to the 

COA Audit Team assigned to the 

agency within five (5) working days 

from receipt of the approved plan 

from the PCW or their mother or 

central offices, as the case maybe. 

Likewise, a copy of the 

corresponding Accomplishment 

Report shall be furnished the said 

Audit Team within five (5) working 

days from the end of January of the 

preceding year. 

 

No. 7 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint 

Circular No. 2012-01 set the 

Schedule to be observed in GAD 

Planning and Budgeting. It provides 

that submission of reviewed GPBs 

and Accomplishment Reports (ARs) 

to PCW shall be one year before the 

budget year. 

 

Section 4.4 of PCW-NEDA-DBM 

Joint Circular No. 2012-01 states 

The agency shall develop or 

integrate in its existing database 

GAD information to include gender 

For CY 2020, P374,395,612.57 or 17 percent of the total DOT appropriations of 

P2,256,475,969.35 was allocated for GAD-related activities of which 

P342,179,544.30 had been spent leaving an unutilized balance of P32,216,068.27.   

Deficiencies such as non-submission of the GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) and 

Accomplishment Reports (ARs) and non-accomplishment of planned activities 

were noted in various DOT offices. 

 

The audit observations on GAD by the DOT Audit Teams for CY 2020 are as 

follows: 

 

Office/RO Observations 

XIII GAD Plan and Budget was not prepared/submitted 

III, XII GAD budget was not equivalent to the required total amount 

of at least 5% of Total Appropriations, to wit:  

                 Region III  – 3.4%           

                             XII – 1%         

II, IV-A GAD Accomplishment Reports (ARs) were not submitted 

CO, CAR, VII, 

VIII, X 

Implementation of GAD projects/programs activities were not 

fully accomplished/attained 

CO, CAR, III, V, 

VII, X, XI 

GAD Budget was not fully utilized 

NCR, VI GAD expenditures exceeded the allocated budget  

 

GAD targets of CO, ROs VII, X, and CAR were not also fully accomplished. 

Apparently the reason for the non and partial implementation of planned GAD 

activities was mainly due to the restrictions brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

It should be noted that despite the above deficiencies on the preparation and 

submission of GPB and Accomplishments by some DOT ROs, the Central Office 

had prepared the consolidated GAD reports of the entire DOT and were submitted 

and endorsed to PCW. 

 

Moreover, inquiry with the GAD Focal Point System (GFPS) Secretariat of the DOT 

CO and as provided in the consolidated GAD AR disclosed that P252,794,536.00 

was budgeted relative to Project, Plan and Activities of the DOT CO: Branding and 

Marketing Communications DOT Campaign: It’s More Fun in the Philippines. 

However, accomplishment showed that the incurred cost amounting to 

P281,603,654.63 was higher than the allotted budget resulting to a discrepancy or 

over-spending of P28,809,118.63. 

 

Further evaluation of GAD AR in the DOT CO disclosed that Management has 

already started the maintenance of sex-disaggregated data and statistics of the 

agency.  

 

Inability of the Management to completely implement all GAD planned activities 

had rendered the relative gender issues not addressed and its’ GAD mandates 

unfulfilled. Likewise, intended budget for these activities are not fully utilized.  



128 

 

LRRs Observations and Recommendations 

statistics and sex-disaggregated data 

that have been systematically 

produced or gathered as inputs or 

bases for planning, budgeting, 

programming, and policy 

formulation. 

 

We recommended that Management direct the Central and Regional Offices’ 

GAD Focal Persons to:  

 

a. ensure that all activities addressing the DOT gender issues and concerns that 
are mainstreamed in the regular programs/project/activities of the office are 

incorporated in the GPB with a budget allocation of at least five (5%) 

percent of the agency’s total appropriation, and are implemented 

accordingly; 

 

b. strictly monitor the implementation of GAD programs and activities in 
accordance with the GAD Plan and Budget to ensure its timely and efficient 

implementation and submission of Accomplishment Report within 

prescribed deadlines; and  

 

c. consider other possible recourse of action on how to implement GAD 

activities with the current COVID-19 pandemic.   
 

During the exit conference, Management from the DOT CO commented that for CY 

2020 they have already mainstreamed GAD in two of their regular programs namely 

Branding and Tourism Industry Training Program (TITP). Based on the Project 

Implementation and Management Monitoring Evaluation that were submitted to 

PCW together with the DOT GAD AR, 58.35 percent and 68.70 percent of the 

budgets of Branding and TITP, respectively, were attributed to GAD.  

 

For FY 2021, the DOT’s GPB endorsed by the PCW with the budget allocation of 

11.31 percent of the DOT’s total FY 2021 Appropriation are already for signature of 

the Department of Tourism Secretary. Management committed to submit the 

endorsed GPB once it is duly signed. 

 

RA No. 656 or otherwise known as the Property Insurance Law 

COA Circular No. 92-390 dated 

November 17, 1992 and RA No. 

656, otherwise known as Property 

Insurance Law, as amended by PD 

No. 245, require all government 

agencies for the inventory of 

physical assets and to insure with 

General Insurance Fund (GIF) of 

Government Service Insurance 

Sytem (GSIS) all its insurable 

property against any insurable risk 

and pay the corresponding 

premiums thereon. 

Various physical assets and properties of the DOT with total carrying value/cost 

of P102,031,243.94 were not adequately insured with the GSIS thus, the 

government may not be indemnified or compensated in the event that the 

Agency’s properties are damaged or lost due to fire, earthquake, storm and 

other calamities. 

 

The details of the insured and uninsured properties of the DOT CO and ROs are

129 

 

LRRs Observations and Recommendations 

The Audit Team noted that while the DOT has an existing Fire/Lighting Insurance 

Policy with the GSIS, not all of its properties were insured with the GIF of GSIS . 

 

The inadequate insurance for all insurable properties of DOT does not only violate 

the abovementioned provisions but also deprived the agency of sufficient and reliable 

protection against any damage to or loss of their properties in the event of direct 

physical loss or damage from any external cause.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed that all of the insurable physical 

assets and properties of the DOT CO and ROs shall be insured with the GSIS 

this year 2021, in compliance with Section 5 of RA No. 656 and in accordance 

with COA Circular No. 92-390 dated November 17, 1992. 

 

Management had submitted their insurance policy for the Motor Vehicle and 

committed to coordinate with GSIS for the processing of the coverage for the 

uninsured properties this year, subject to the pertinent rules on insuring PPEs. 

 

Programs and Projects for Senior Citizens and Differently-Abled Persons 

Section 32 of RA No. 11465 

provides that all agencies of the 

government shall formulate plans, 

programs and projects intended to 

address the concerns of senior 

citizens and differently-abled 

person, insofar as it relates to their 

mandated functions, and integrate 

the same in their regular activities.  

 

Moreover, Item 4.2 of the DBM-

DSWD Joint Circular No. 2003-01 

dated April 28, 2003 states that All 

government agencies, department, 

bureaus, offices, commissions, and 

state universities and colleges shall 

allocate at least one percent (1%) of 

their respective budget for 

implementation of plans, programs, 

projects and activities and services 

for older persons and persons with 

disabilities. 

 

 

DOT CO and other DOT ROs failed to formulate plans, programs and projects 

intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and differently-abled 

persons.   

  

Audit showed that the DOT CO and its’ Regional Offices still failed to fully comply 

with the previous audit recommendation to formulate and implement activities which 

address the concerns of the SCs and PWDs.  

 

Nonetheless, it was indicated in the regional audit reports of Region I, VI, VII,  IX, 

XI and CAR that they have been compliant while Region III, V, VIII and XII  have 

incurred expenses related to Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability 

(PWDs) in their regular P/P/As, to wit: 

 

Office/ 

ROs 
Remarks 

III Out of the budget of P50,000.00, total cost incurred was P46,128.00. 

V Out of the budget of P420,000.00, total cost incurred was P303,017.11 

VIII Total cost incurred amounted to P388,800.00. 

XII Allocation of P150,000.00 was fully utilized. 

 

Inquiry from focal person of the DOT CO disclosed that the proposed projects for 

SC and PWD for CY 2020 was delayed and was rescheduled on the 2nd quarter of 

CY 2021. Apparently this is due to the effect of the prevailing pandemic in the work 

arrangement of personnel in charge. 

 

We reiterated our previous years’ recommendation that the Management 

prepare and formulate plans/programs/projects and ensure that several 

activities contained therein will be implemented to address the interests and 

concerns of the senior citizens and differently-abled persons in compliance with 

the General Appropriations Act and integrate the same in the regular activities 

of the agency. 

 

DOT CO commented that while there has been delay in the implementation of the 

CY 2020 Programs for SCs and PWDs as a result of the prevailing pandemic, they 



130 

 

LRRs Observations and Recommendations 

have prepared and are willing to implement programs that will benefit both SC and 

PWD sectors of the DOT workforce for the current year.

RA No. 10963, otherwise known as 

the TRAIN Law, relative to 

withholding of income Tax, RR No. 

11-2019 dated January 31, 2019 

provides that all employers 

(Government/Private) offices are 

constituted as withholding agents 

for purposes of the creditable tax 

required to be withheld on income 

payments from compensation, 

contractors, suppliers of goods and 

other services.  

 

As withholding agents, they are 

primarily liable for the payment of 

the taxes to the National Treasury 

thru Bureau of Internal Revenue 

(BIR). 

 
Under Section 6, par. B.11 of 

Revenue Regulation No. 11-2018 

dated 31 January 2018, 13th month 

pay and other benefits such as 

Christmas bonus, productivity 

incentive bonus, loyalty award, gifts 

in cash or in kind and other benefits 

of similar nature actually received 

by officials and employees of 

government offices are exempted 

from taxation provided that the 

total amount received shall not 

exceed ninety thousand pesos 

(P90,000.00).  

 

In addition, Part II of BIR Revenue 

Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 23-

2014 dated June 20, 2014 states that 

all government offices including 

government-owned or controlled 

corporations (such as but not limited 

to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, x 

xx) are constituted as withholding 

agents for purposes of the creditable 

tax required to be withheld on the 

following: 

 

Section 80 of the same National 

Internal Revenue Code clearly 

DOT has substantially complied with the requirements on the withholding and 

remittance to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) of taxes on payments of 

goods and services. Moreover, it was noted that the DOT CO has not withheld

prescribed under Section 6 par B.11 of Revenue Regulation No. 11-2018. 

 

For CY 2020, the taxes withheld and remitted aggregated P19,616,558.34 and 

P104,483,867.47 respectively, leaving a balance of P15,132,690.87 of which 

P14,965,877.35 was remitted in CY 2021, while the amount of P166,813.52 is still 

subject for reconciliation and adjustment. The amount pertains to the following:

withholding of taxes and are for refund and ₱1,402.51, corresponding to the ending 

balance in CY 2018 which is still subject for reconciliation. 

 

For RO XI, under withholding of taxes totaling P165,375.00 was noted in audit due 

to inaccurate computation of taxes withheld for the payment of professional fees 

amounting to P2,515,000.00 contrary to Section 2 of BIR Revenue Regulation 11-

2018 dated January 31, 2018.  

 

It was further observed in DOT CO that it was not able to withhold tax on other 

benefits received by its’ employees in excess of P90,000.00. 

 

The Audit Team also emphasized that withholding taxes were not remitted intact to 

the BIR within ten days and recommended the Management to take appropriate 

action on the said observation. 

 

During the exit conference, the Management committed to timely remit in full the 

taxes withheld from their employees and suppliers. 

  

Inability of the Management to sufficiently withhold and remit taxes on the said 

employee benefits deprived the government of income which could have been used 

for the implementation of projects beneficial to the public.

LRRs Observations and Recommendations 

emphasizes that the employer shall 

be liable for the withholding and 

remittance of the correct amount of 

tax required to be deducted and 

withheld under this Chapter.  

 

 If the employer fails to withhold 

and remit the correct amount of tax 

as required to be withheld under the 

provision of this Chapter, such tax 

shall be collected from the employer 

together with the penalties or 

additions to the tax otherwise 

applicable in respect to such failure 

to withhold and remit. 

 

We recommended that Management direct the concerned Accountants of the 

DOT CO and ROs to:  

 

a. collect from the concerned officials and employees of the DOT CO and remit 

to the BIR any tax deficiency on the payments of the bonuses received by the 

DOT employees exceeding the P90,000.00 threshold; and 

 

b. religiously remit all monthly withheld taxes on or before the 10th day of each 

succeeding month to avoid over/under deduction and remittances in strict 

compliance of the BIR tax regulations to avoid penalties that may be imposed 

in accordance with tax law, rules and regulations. 

 

 

RA No. 8291 or GSIS Act of 1997 

Section 14 of the IRR of R.A. No. 

8291 states the following: 

“Each government agency shall 

remit directly to the GSIS the 

employees’ and government 

agency’s contributions within the 

first Ten (10) days of the calendar 

month following the month to which 

the contributions apply. The 

remittance by the government 

agency of the contributions to the 

GSIS shall take priority over and 

above the payment of any and all 

obligations, except salaries and 

wages of its employees. 

 

Except for the DOT CO, NCR, ROs II and V, all other ROs were generally 

compliant with the regular remittances of the GSIS compulsory premiums and 

loan amortizations deducted from the salaries of its personnel as well as its 

corresponding shares as employer pursuant to RA No. 8291. 

 

Out of the total contributions and loan deductions withheld of P45,481,056.54, the 

amount of P44,573,057.05 was remitted during the year, leaving a balance of 

P907,999.49 as of December 31, 2020 of which P510,874.18 was remitted in January 

2021. The balance of P397,125.31 which remained unremitted is still subject for 

verification and reconciliation. Details of which are as follows:

It is important that Management   closely monitor the proper   withholding and timely 

remittance of all premium contributions and loans of the employees. Failure to remit 

the deductions may result to unnecessary interest charges and may deprive the 

employees of the privileges, and such other benefits offered to all GSIS members 

thereby causing undue disadvantage to them. 

 

Management commented during the exit conference that they are currently 

reconciling the records of the Human Resources, Cash and Accounting Sections and 

are already coordinating with GSIS regarding this matter. 

 

We reiterated our prior year’s recommendation that Management direct the 

concerned Accountants to immediately review and reconcile the unremitted 

balances; and ensure full remittance of withheld contributions on or before the 

deadline to strictly comply with the provisions of RA No. 8291, the GSIS Act of  

1997.

LRRs Observations and Recommendations 

RA No. 9679 or the Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) Law of 2009 

Rule VII, Section 3, Paragraph (a) of 

the IRR of RA No. 9679 states the 

following: 

“All employers shall remit to the 

Fund their contributions and the 

contributions of their covered 

employees as well as the latter’s loan 

amortizations or payments to the 

Fund, as provided for under Section 

2 of this Rule, when applicable, 

within 15 days from the date the 

same were collected unless another 

period is previously agreed upon 

between the employer and the Fund, 

or within such periods as the Fund 

may prescribe otherwise. The Fund 

may prescribe a different remittance 

schedule for Filipinos employed by 

foreign based employers depending 

on the nature of their contracts or 

manner of their deployment abroad. 

 

Except for the DOT CO, all of the DOT ROs were compliant with RA No. 9679 

on the remittance of the employees’ and employers’ PAG-IBIG 

contributions/shares in a timely manner. 

 

Of the   contributions and loan deductions withheld totaling   P6,869,539.41, a total 

of P6,744,874.87 was remitted   as of year-end, leaving an unremitted balance of 

P124,664.54. Of the unremitted balances as of December 31, 2020, P64,402.21 was 

already remitted by concerned Regions early in CY 2021, while P5,712.50 pertaining 

to deductions for loan amortizations and contributions for newly hired and promoted 

employees of DOT NCR was not yet remitted. The unremitted balance of P54,549.83 

in the books of the DOT CO is still subject for reconciliation. 

 

The monthly contributions and deductions for loan amortization withheld by the 

DOT CO from the salaries of its employees were not remitted intact to Pag-IBIG, 

thereby resulting to either under or over-remittance of the monthly withholdings or 

net unremitted amount of P54,549.83 as of December 31, 2020. 

 

DOT CO Management commented that the unremitted balance of   P281,477.30 was 

already remitted on December 2 and 4, 2020. The unremitted/late remittance of 

P608.27 pertains to the contribution of the newly-hired personnel without MID 

Number. Management committed that upon receipt of the MID number, GSD-Cash 

will immediately remit the premium.   

 

It is mandatory on the part of the agency to closely monitor the proper withholding 

and timely remittance of all premium contributions and loan repayments of the 

employees. Failure to remit the deductions may result to unnecessary interest charges 

and may deprive the employees of the privileges, and such other benefits offered to 

all HDMF/Pag-IBIG members thereby causing undue disadvantage to them. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. require the Accountants of the DOT CO to reconcile the Due to Pag-IBIG 
account and immediately remit and/or correct the under/over remittance to 

the HDMF, if warranted; and  

 

b. all the DOT ROs to strictly comply with the provisions of R.A. No. 9679, the 
HDMF Law of 2009 otherwise known as Pag-IBIG fund. 

 

National Health Insurance Act of 199 (RA No. 9241) 

RA No. 9241 or the National Health

Contributions – The schedule of 

premium contributions shall be

the basis of applicable actuarial 

studies to be issued to members and 

Except for the DOT CO, NCR and RO IV-B, all other ROs were compliant with   

the withholding and remittances of the PhilHealth premium contributions of 

employed members.  

 

Out of the total withheld PhilHealth premium contributions of P4,925,690.56 by the 

DOT CO and ROs, the amount of P4,673,635.93 was remitted in CY 2020 while 

P252,054.63 was unremitted as of December 31, 2020, of which P42,394.33 was 

remitted in January 2021 and P209,660.19 is still subject for reconciliation. 

 

For the DOT CO,  NCR and RO IV-B, PhilHealth premiums were withheld monthly

Review and analysis of records revealed that such balance was remitted only in the

The delayed remittance of premiums withheld within the period prescribed exposes 

the DOT to penalties and charges. Also, non-remittance of premium contributions 

may affect the PhilHealth benefits of the concerned members as provided in the IRR 

of RA No. 9241.

Audit of COVID-19-Related Expenditures 

 

16. Audit of COVID-19 related expenditures disclosed that: (a) there was a low utilization 
of funds allotted for COVID-related activities due to the late downloading of funds 

by the DOT CO to its ROs; (b) communication/internet allowances, hazard pays and 

financial assistance to distressed tourists due to COVID-19 were paid despite the lack 

of supporting documents; (c) there were COVID-19 related expenses without legal 



134 

 

basis; (d) cash advance for expenses related to COVID-19 were disbursed for other 

purpose; and (e) there were lapses in the conduct of Emergency Procurements .  

 

16.1 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General's opening 
remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic 

which indicates significant global spread of the infectious disease, thus,  countries must 

take a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach, built-around comprehensive 

strategy to prevent infections, save lives and minimize impact of the virus. Countries were 

also called to activate and scale up emergency response mechanisms and communicate 

with people about the risks and how they can protect themselves.   

 

16.2 To address the COVID-19 health emergency, the Inter Agency Task Force for the 
Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) through Resolution No. 29 (D) 

authorized the DOT to undertake the necessary measures to charter and fund sweeper 

flights for stranded tourists from other regions to the National Capital Region.  

 

16.3 In coordination with various NGAs and LGUs, the DOT has assisted tourists, both 
international and domestic, whose flights were affected by the community quarantine 

impositions across the country since March 15, 2020.  

 

16.4 The DOT, together with the IATF-EID and the LGUs, is continuously mounting every 
recovery flights, increasing the capacity for transportation to international and local 

gateways and deploying more personnel in the airports to better assist the needs of stranded 

and waiting tourists.  

 

16.5 Further, Section 6 (j), Chapter II of RA No. 9593 states that the DOT shall monitor 
conditions of any tourist and community in the Philippines and, in consultation with the 

LGUs and law enforcers, issue timely advisories on the safety or viability of travel to 

particular places within the Philippines and on patronage of entities engaged in tourism-

related activities and of tourism products.  

 

16.6 In view of the foregoing, the DOT CO received funds from TPB in the amount of 
P7,000,000.00 and total of P65,499,597.83 sourced from realignment of regular funds to 

procure and implement projects that will assist the country in the achievement of its set 

objectives against the spread of COVID-19. Of the total funds received, P15,779,289.83 

was obligated and disbursed by the DOT CO and P11,125,924.00 was downloaded to the 

DOT ROs. 

 

16.7 Audit of utilization of COVID funds released to the DOT CO and ROs disclosed the 
following observations: 

 

a) Low utilization of funds due to late downloading of funds by the DOT CO to ROs 
 

16.8 Audit of funds intended for COVID-19 disclosed that the DOT CO had downloaded funds 
to several ROs for the rollout of community quarantine guidelines on hotel operations. 

However, based on DOT’s report on funds utilized for COVID-19 pandemic and the 



135 

 

submitted Check Disbursement Journals, as of December 31, 2020, it showed the late 

downloading of funds by the DOT CO to ROs, details as follows:

16.9 In DOT RO II, the activities intended for the “Tourism Bouncing Back: Restarting the 
Confidence to Travel Project” in the total amount of P3,139,500.00 are still being 

implemented by the DOT RO II. The big chunk amounting to P2,000,000.00 will undergo 

Public Bidding (Consulting Services) in which the Project Officer is currently working on. 

Other activities under this budget include site validation and inspection which are currently 

being done.  Printing of Health and Safety Guidelines stickers were already accomplished.  

Likewise, Management ensured that utilization of the fund will be maximized. 

 

16.10 DOT Regional offices II, V, VII and IX received funds from the DOT CO to augment the 
budget of their respective Accreditation Unit to facilitate the immediate conduct of physical 

inspections of various accommodation establishments in their efforts to reopen tourism in 

their respective regions. This is in response to the immediate need of ensuring that all 

tourism establishments applying for accreditation and issuance of Provisional Certificate 

of Authority to Operate (PCAO) by DOT to various hotels, resorts and other 

accommodation establishments are compliant with the minimum Public Health Standards 

set by the Department of Health (DOH) and the Health and Safety Guidelines set by the 

DOT. 

 

16.11 It was noted that the release of funds from the Department of Budget and Management was 
delayed and so with the actual transfer of funds to the said DOT ROs, hence, physical 

inspection which was initially intended to be conducted during the months of July to 

August 2020 could not be undertaken.  

 

16.12 However, considering that the DOT was already behind schedule of their targeted dates, 
the Management should have already planned and implemented the immediate deployment 

of DOT personnel for the roll out of the conduct of physical inspections of various 

establishments across the region, right after the receipt of funds, to urgently address the 

pressing needs of the affected establishments and their respective guests. 

   

16.13 On May 13, 2020, the DOT RO IX requested the Tourism, Regulation, Coordination, and 
Resource Generation (TRCRG) for additional funding due to the additional reported cases 

of forty-seven (47) stranded domestic tourists in Region IX who are qualified for the 

Tourist Care Plan assistance. Unfortunately, funds amounting to P94,000.00 was released 



136 

 

only on July 7, 2020, when some restrictions with the different localities in the Zamboanga 

Peninsula were already lifted. Despite the conscious effort exerted by the DOT RO IX to 

extend the assistance to the identified beneficiaries, only five (5) stranded domestic tourists 

were able to avail of the one-time flexible cash assistance of P2,000.00 each under the 

COVID-19 Tourist Care Plan. The others have already left for their respective residences. 

 

16.14 The one-time flexible voucher cash assistance could have been of great help for the 
stranded individuals to defray much-needed food expenses during the emergency 

lockdown brought about by the pandemic. However, the intended beneficiaries were 

deprived of such benefits due to the late releases of funds; hence, the objectives of the 

programs/projects for which the funds were allocated were not fully attained. 

 

16.15 We recommended and Management of the DOT CO and ROs agreed to closely 
coordinate with each other on the timely release and requests of funds to speed up the 

implementation of programs and to promptly deliver expected results.  

 

b) Payments of communication/internet allowance, hazard pay and financial assistance 
to distressed tourist due to COVID-19 despite the lack of documents to support their 

validity  

 

16.16 Item 7.4 of CSC-COA-DBM Joint Circular (JC) No. 1, s.2017 dated June 15, 2017 states 
that: 

 

“The services of the contract of service and job order workers are not covered by 

Civil Service law and rules thus, not creditable as government service. They do not 

enjoy the benefits enjoyed by government employees, such as leave, PERA, RATA 

and thirteenth month pay.”  

 

16.17 Subsection 3.3 of COA-DBM JC No. 1 s.2020 on interim guidelines governing Contract 
of Service (COS) and Job Order (JO) workers in government for the duration of the state 

of calamity and community quarantine due to the COVID-19 provides payment of 

additional benefit as follows: 

 

“COS and JO workers who will be part of the agency skeletal workforce and will 

be able to physically report for work during the quarantine period may be granted 

appropriate additional benefit, as may be authorized by the Office of the President.” 

 

16.18 Section 2 of Administrative Order No. 26 s.2020 authorized the grant of hazard pay to 
government personnel who physically report for work during the period of implementation 

of an enhanced community quarantine relative to the COVID-19 outbreak and provides for 

the conditions on the grant of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay.  

 

16.19 Paragraph 5.7 of CSC MC No. 18, s. 2020 dated October 15, 2020 states that “Agencies 
shall adopt a monitoring mechanism such as submission of daily/weekly accomplishment 



137 

 

report/s, etc., during the implementation of the alternative work arrangements to ensure 

that public service delivery is not prejudiced.”

Total 1,033,725.86      

 

16.21 DOT RO III granted communication and internet allowances to its 7 COs/JO workers 
totaling P30,090.00. The said allowances were granted to the JO workers assigned at the 

Clark International Airport who assisted stranded tourists during the community quarantine 

brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as the services of the JO workers are 

not covered by Civil Service Commission laws, rules, and regulations and not creditable 

as government service, they are not considered as employees of the national government 

to be eligible for the grant of the subject allowances. Moreover, the grant thereof to COS 

and JO workers for the duration of the state of calamity and community quarantine due to 

the COVID-19 has no specific legal authority and no authorization from the President as 

required by the COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1 s.2020. 

  



138 

 

16.22 Moreover, the grant of communication and internet allowances to COS and JO workers for 
the duration of the state of calamity and community quarantine due to the COVID-19 has 

no statutory basis or specific legal authority and has no authorization from the President as 

required by the COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1 s.2020. 

 

16.23 Inquiry with the Accountant disclosed that the reimbursement of communication and 
internet allowance is in accordance with the DOT DO No. 2020-035 dated June 9, 2020 

and its supplemental order, DOT DO No. 2020-035A dated October 15, 2020, regarding 

the guidelines on mobile phone and postpaid plan subscription allowance of the DOT 

officials and authorized employees.     

 

16.24 In DOT RO XIII, DV and Liquidation Report on the financial assistance to the domestic 
tourists in distress in Caraga Region disclosed that aside from the lacking documents, DOT 

RO distributed/granted cash assistance to the stranded tourists instead of giving away 

vouchers worth P2,000 as directed in the letter of instruction. 

 

16.25 We recommended and Management agreed to direct the officials of ROs concerned 
to: 

 

a. provide the Audit Team with the legal basis or authority in the promulgation of 
DOT DO No. 2020-035A dated October 15, 2020 for the grant of communication 

and internet allowances to JO workers;  

 

b. submit the lacking documents on the payment of hazard pay and financial 
assistance to distressed tourists due to COVID-19 and ensure that future 

payment of benefits is duly supported with necessary documents and are in 

accordance with law, rules and regulations and enabling guidelines; and 

 

c. henceforth, stop the practice of granting allowances and incentives to individuals 
whose services are engaged on job orders, contracts of service, or of similar 

nature where there is no employer-employee relationship in the absence of 

statutory basis or specific legal authority. 

 

c) COVID-19 related expenses without legal basis  
 

16.26 Section 2 of PD 1445 provides that all resources of the government shall be managed, 
expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguards against loss 

or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, 

economy and effectiveness in the operations of government. 

 

16.27 Expenses amounting to P464,200.00 representing room accommodation and meals of 11 
DOT RO IVA personnel while in isolation in a quarantine facility for 14 days, were charged 

and paid out of government funds. DOT RO IV B also paid an amount of P78,750.00, net 

of tax, for the accommodation of the five (5) Regional Office personnel with exposure to 

COVID-19 confirmed and probable cases for the period October 14 to 24, 2020.        

Thorough review of the DOT DO No. 2020-034 shows no provision therein that quarantine 



139 

 

expenses for isolation of personnel shall be chargeable against the MOOE funds of the 

DOT. Similarly, DOH Memorandum Circular No. 2020-0131, which were quoted as 

reference in the DOT DO likewise bears no specific provision to charge against the funds 

of the respective government agencies the quarantine expenses of their personnel.   

 

16.28 Moreover, purchase and distribution of the DOT RO X of goods, such as grocery items, 
trays of eggs, and sacks of rice amounting to P141,564.03 to their COVID-19 response 

team composing of 18 job orders and 11 regular employees have no specific law or specific 

authorization from appropriate agency to support the grant of such benefits.         

 

16.29 We recommended that Management provide sufficient legal basis for the 
authorization of payment for hotel accommodation and meals of the DOT personnel 

with exposure to COVID-19 and the grant of benefits such as grocery items to job 

orders and regular employees. 

 

d) Cash advance for expenses related to COVID-19 were disbursed for other purpose 
 

16.30 Section 4.7 of PD No. 1445 requires that all laws and regulations applicable to financial 
transactions shall be faithfully adhered to. 

 

16.31 Section 4.1.7 of COA Circular No. 97-002 as amended by COA Circular No. 2006- 05, 
provides that, “The cash advance shall be used solely for the specific legal purpose for 

which it was granted. Under no circumstance shall it be used for encashment of checks or 

for liquidation of a previous cash advance.” 
 

16.32 DOT RO VI released a cash advance in the amount of P166,250.00 for the purchase of 
COVID-19 testing kits for the DOT RO and Boracay Compliance and Monitoring Field 

(BCMF) Office staff. A total of P74,767.86 was expended for the payment of the purchased 

COVID-19 Testing Kits. The remaining P91,482.15 was disbursed on expenses not related 

to the purpose such as, honorarium, registration fee, snacks, freight charges, professional 

fee, bank charges, insurance premium, and purchase of face masks and shields. Likewise, 

cash advance for COVID-19 related interventions/ activities of DOT RO X were utilized 

for the purchase of 4 sets of Nokia 105 cellphones.  

 

16.33 We recommended that Management instruct the Accountant to scrutinize the 
liquidation reports submitted and allow only the expenditures that are disbursed for 

the purpose of which the cash advance was granted and those that are intimately 

related to it or those that attributes to the success of the implementation thereof. 
 

e) Lapses in the conduct of Emergency Procurement 
 

16.34 Section 3.2 of GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 dated April 6, 2020 requires the posting of the 
approved revised APP on the Procurement Entity’s (PE’s) website and submission to the 

GPPB or posting on the GPPB online portal or Emergency Procurement under the 

Bayanihan Act, once operational, on or before 30 September 2020. 

 



140 

 

16.35 Sections 3.1 and 4 of GPPB Resolution No. 06-2020 dated April 6, 2020 provides the 
preparation of Project Requirements containing important details of the project and the 

submission of the bidder’s documentary requirements in case of negotiated procurement in 

emergency cases.  

 

16.36 Review of Emergency procurements made during the COVID-19 pandemic disclosed the 
following observations:  

 

Office/RO Observation/s 

CO Contract Agreement of one (1) out of the nine (9) procured 

Sweeper Flights for Stranded Domestic Tourists affected by the 

COVID-19 was prepared by the contractor instead of the DOT CO 

Management, thereby resulted in discrepancies in details provided 

in the contract agreement and the approved BAC recommendations 

contained in the BAC Resolution No. 2020-091. 

III 

  

Management was not able to post in the PhilGEPS website and the 

website of the agency the relative NOA, PO and NTP on the 

procurement of basic food and essential hygiene supplies 

amounting to P125,922.90 for the COVID-19 Tourist Care Plan 

under Negotiated Procurement for Emergency Cases. 

VIII Management was not able to prepare and submit project 

requirements and an updated APP.  

X The documents on procurement for COVID-19 related 

intervention/ activities disclosed some defects. Verification of 

selected disbursements with significant amount revealed missing 

signatures and non-indication of details of purchases starting from 

Purchase Requests up to Inspection and Acceptance Reports. 

Temporary receipts were also accepted for two purchases made 

from an online seller. The required Mayor’s Business Permit and 

PhilGEPS Registration Number were not included in the submitted 

documents. 

 

16.37 On the other hand, it is worth mentioning that, except for few documents that were not 
submitted, it was noted that the method of procurement of DOT CO, in general, is in 

compliance, in all material respects, with Rule XVI and Annex H of the 2016 RIRR of RA 

No. 9184, pertinent provisions of RA Nos. 11469 (Bayanihan Act One), GPPB Circular 

No. 01-2020 dated April 6, 2020, and GPPB Resolution No. 06-2020 dated April 6, 2020. 

 

16.38 The Management explained that delays in the submission of the required documents are 
due to the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 situation.            

 

16.39 We recommended that Management direct the BAC and/or BAC Secretariat to 
immediately submit the required lacking documents to facilitate further review and 

evaluation of the subject contract; and henceforth, strictly adhere with the provisions 

of the RIRR of RA No. 9184, GPPB Circular No. 01-2020 dated April 6, 2020 and 

GPPB Resolution No. 06-2020 dated April 6, 2020.  



141 

 

National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Funds (NDRRMF) 

 

17. As of CY 2020, the DOT and its implementing agencies were still not compliant with 
the reporting guidelines relative to the receipt and utilization of the NDRRMF as 

prescribed under Paragraph V.C of COA Circular No. 2014-002 dated April 15, 2014, 

hence, stakeholders, foreign and local donors were not properly informed on the 

status of the P330,133,000.00 releases from GAA-NDRRMF and cash donations of 

P7,861,411.56 received from the Office of the President and various local and foreign 

tourism organizations. 
 

17.1 Paragraph V.C of the same COA Circular provides, “The required reports on the receipt 
and utilization of DRRMF sourced from GAA and donations in cash and in-kind shall be 

posted in the official websites of the implementing/donee-agency, Office of the Civil 

Defense (OCD) and NDRRMC”. 

 

17.2 DOT received funds aggregating P337,994,411.56 to support the implementation of the 
DOT RO VIII’s Technical Advisory Services and financial assistance for the DOT 

employees and other victims of the Typhoon Yolanda, wherein 97.67 percent or 

P330,133,000.00 was received through Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) from 

NDRRMF and 2.33 percent or P7,861,411.56 were received from the Office of the

17.4 Funds received from the OP were all utilized as financial assistance to the DOT employees 
affected by typhoon Yolanda, while donations from various local and foreign tourism 

organizations were transferred to the DSWD. Based on the confirmation made from DSWD 

on the status of the fund transfers, the fund that the agency received were also transferred 

to their Region IV Field Office for the implementation of various tourism projects in 

Yolanda affected communities.      

 

17.5 The DOT CO has submitted the updated liquidation report to the OCD through the 
Presidential Management Staff (PMS) on CY 2020. However, one of the financial 

assistance included therein which was granted by the DOT Region VII was disallowed by 

the PMS validator and requested the DOT to refund the amount from the beneficiary. 

 

17.6 Likewise, the aforesaid reports were still not posted in the official website of the DOT 
contrary to Paragraph IV.C of COA Circular No. 2014-002 hence, stakeholders, foreign 

and local donors were not properly informed on the status of the GAA-NDRRMF releases 

and cash donations received from the OP and various local and foreign tourism 

organizations. 

 



143 

 

17.7 Management through the CO and Regional Accountant of RO VII has already sent a 
demand letter to Mr. Karl Bru, beneficiary of financial assistance disallowed by the PMS. 

The DOT also commented that the Accounting Division shall comply with the guidelines 

relative to the receipt and utilization of the NDRRMF. 
 

17.8 We recommended Management to: 
 

a. publish the updated information on NDRRMF in the DOT official website; and 
 

b. comply immediately with the requirements of the PMS and monitor the refund of 
disallowed financial assistance. 

 

 

Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) Fund  

 

18. The funds transferred by the DOT to the DPWH amounting to P2,014,726,000.00 in 
CYs 2012 and 2013 for the joint implementation of the Convergence Program on 

Enhancing Tourism Access and Redevelopment of Roxas Boulevard Project funded 

under the DAP was not fully liquidated, with an outstanding balance of 

P16,435,481.52 or 0.82 percent. 
 

18.1 The DAP was introduced by the government as a reform intervention to speed up spending 
and boost the economic growth of the Philippines.  

 

18.2 Relative thereto, two MOAs were executed by the DOT, DPWH and the Research 
Education and Institutional Development Foundation Inc. (REID) on January 19, 2012 and 

January 16, 2014, respectively. Details of which are as follows: 
 

a) Convergence Program on Enhancing Tourism Access, a joint undertaking of the DOT 
and the DPWH to identify, evaluate, prioritize, and provide tourism road infrastructure 

in priority tourist clusters, development areas and sites in the Philippines. 

 

b) Redevelopment of Roxas Boulevard, an eight lane major arterial road with a two-lane 
service road that connects the City of Manila with Pasay and Paranaque City. It is said 

to be the center of the country’s major cultural, historical, touristic and economic 

activities. 

 

18.3 In accordance with the MOAs, the DOT transferred funds to the DPWH-CO and DPWH-
NCR in CYs 2012 and 2013, respectively in the total amount of P2,104,726,000.00. As of 

December 31, 2020, the status of the fund transfers are as follows:

18.4 For CY 2020, no liquidation was submitted by the DPWH on their remaining balance thus, 
the amount of P16,435,481.52 or 0.82 percent of the total fund transfers remained 

outstanding as at year-end.  

 

18.5 In compliance with previous years’ audit recommendations, the Management sent a 
demand letter on December 16, 2020 to the DPWH. However, the DPWH Finance Division 

replied that the implementing offices has yet to submit the DVs for payments made in 

relation to the project. 
 

18.6 Further, the accomplishment/terminal reports as required under the MOA, were still to be 
submitted to the DOT by the concerned implementing offices. 
 

18.7 In view of Management’s failure to strictly enforce full accounting and settlement of these 
fund releases, the actual expenditures are not reported and recorded in the books in a timely 

manner. Likewise, considering the materiality of the accumulated fund transfers, this could 

have deprived the government of using the herein funds for other projects or purposes. 

 

18.8 Management commented in their written reply that the Accounting Division was directed 
to continuously send letters to DPWH demanding the full liquidation/settlement of the 

outstanding balance. The most recent demand letters sent to DPWH were dated December 

16, 2020 and April 28, 2021. The requirement to submit accomplishment/terminal report 

is also contained in the latest demand letter.  

 

18.9 It was further discussed during the exit conference that the DOT Management had already 
met with the Finance Officers of DPWH on May 10, 2021 and the DPWH informed that 

the transmittal of the liquidation and accomplishment reports for the P16 million 

outstanding balance in relation to the DAP is already being prepared and shall be released 

anytime soon. 

 

18.10 We reiterated our previous years’ audit recommendation and Management agreed 
to: 

 

a. direct the Accountant to continuously send demand letters to DPWH to fully 
liquidate the remaining balance; and 

 

b. require the DPWH to submit the Accomplishment/Terminal Reports of the said 
projects as required under the MOAs.

Enforcement of COA Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 

 

19. Unsettled audit suspensions and disallowances as of December 31, 2020 amounted to 
P10,880,605.66 and P493,280,690.44, respectively.  

 

19.1 Pertinent provisions of the 2009 COA Revised Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of 
Accounts, which was prescribed under COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 

2009, provides: “The Head of the Agency, who is primarily responsible for all government 

funds and property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that: (a) xxx; (b) the settlement 

of disallowances and charges is made within the prescribed period; (c) the requirements of 

transactions suspended in audit are complied with.” 

 

19.2 As at December 31, 2020, audit suspensions and disallowances in the amount of

19.3 Despite our prior years’ recommendation that Management enforce settlement of long 
outstanding audit disallowances that are already final and executory, there were only 

settlements amounting to P1,003,487.43 made during the year. 



146 

 

 

19.4 It was noted that Management failed to monitor and exert efforts to demand 
settlement/refund from persons liable and to secure information needed to locate the 

whereabouts of other persons liable who are already retired from service for the issuance 

of notice and demand to settle. 

 

19.5 Management commented that the full settlement of the disallowance of former DOT 
official in the amount of P309,217.20, as contained in the pertinent Supreme Court 

Decision, was received by the BTr per OR No. 7061946 dated February 22, 2021. With 

regard to the disallowance of another former DOT official, post-dated checks were issued 

in the amount of P100,000.00 per month starting July 2020 up to June 2021, with a final 

check dated July 2021 to cause the full settlement in the amount of P29,712.36. Moreover, 

the Management committed to exhaust all efforts to locate the persons liable to be able to 

send Demand Letters for the settlement of disallowances that are final and executory. 

 

19.6 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. direct the Accountant to enforce immediate settlement of the audit disallowances 

that have become final and executory by withholding the salaries and other claims 

of the incumbent officials and employees  and exhausting all means in locating 

the present whereabouts of former/retired DOT officials and employees, other 

individuals and entities for purposes of sending due notice, demanding settlement 

of their accounts and filing of appropriate charges, as warranted; 

 

b. direct the immediate submission of the required documents for the suspended 

transactions to prevent the same from maturing into disallowances; and 

 

c. require the officials concerned to comply with laws, rules and regulations to avoid 

audit suspensions, disallowances, and charges and settle the same within the 

prescribed period to prevent their accumulation. 

 

 

National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) 

 

20. No funds were received relative to the National Task Force to End Local Communist 
Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC). 

 

 

Audit of Marawi Funds 

 

21. No funds were received for the implementation of “Marawi” Programs.
