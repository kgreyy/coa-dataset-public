OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

A. Financial Audit 
 

Unrecorded interest income from Cash in Bank-Local Currency Accounts- Trust Fund 

 

1. Interest income earned from the Trust Fund account for CY 2020 and prior 
years totaling ₱2,467,487.01 were not recognized in the books, resulting in the 

understatement of accounts Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account 

and Trust Liabilities by the same amount at year-end. 

 

One of the compositions of the Trust Fund of DFA is the ESB of OFWs 

received from their employers through the FSPs, which are then remitted to PNB CA 

No. 1514-7000566-3 maintained by OUMWA-DFA at the Home Office for distribution 

to the beneficiaries. 

 

Review of pertinent documents and reports showed that the ESB funds 

maintained with the PNB earned interest income, net of tax, aggregating 

₱2,467,487.01 from CY 2002 to CY 2020 but were not recorded in the books, to wit:       

 

Period Covered Amount (₱) 

CY 2002 to CY 2018 2,167,916.23 

CY 2019 134,294.92 

CY 2020 165,275.86 

Total 2,467,487.01 

 

The above omission resulted in the understatement of accounts Cash in Bank-

Local Currency, Current Account and Trust Liabilities by ₱2,467,487.01. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief 

Accountant to recognize in the books the interest income earned from ESB 

account. 

 

 

Unreliable balance of account Cash in Bank - Foreign Currency 

 

2. The balance of the Cash in Bank-Foreign Currency accounts aggregating 
₱350,763,372.57 was unreliable due to the failure of the Accountant to reconcile 

the SLs with negative balances, unidentified bank balances, and to recognize the 

bank transfer of the bank accounts of closed post to the nearest posts, contrary 

to Section 74 of PD No. 1445 and Paragraph 27 of PPSAS 1, affecting the fair 

presentation of accounts in the financial statements.   

 

Section 74 of PD No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing 

Code of the Philippines states that at the close of each month, depositories shall report 



53 
 

to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition of the agency account 

standing on their books.  The head of the agency shall see to it that reconciliation is 

made between the balance shown in the reports and the balances found in the books 

of the agency. 

 

Paragraph 27 of PPSAS 1 states among others, that the financial statements 

shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an 

entity.  Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of 

transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 

recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. 

 

Finance Officers (FO) of every FSP report all financial transactions through 

the fiscal reports (FRs) which are required to be submitted on or before the 10th day 

of the month following the period covered by the said fiscal reports.  These reports 

are analyzed in the Foreign Service Accounting (FSA) and recognized in the books 

through JEV. As part of the FRs, the FOs also prepare the Monthly Status of Working 

Fund (MSWF) which showed the beginning balance of the fund, the collections and 

deposits and the disbursements made out of the fund and the ending balances of the 

fund in terms of US dollars and local currency.  Cash in bank accounts are duly 

supported by the corresponding bank statements and bank reconciliation statements. 

 

For its part, FSA also prepares the MSWF for the monitoring of the funds in 

the FSPs.  This contains the beginning balances, collections and disbursements and 

the ending balances of cash accounts during the month expressed in terms of US 

Dollars and local currency with peso equivalent. Should there be discrepancies 

between the ending balance of the funds as appearing in the SWF prepared by the FO 

and SSWF prepared by the FSA, the concerned Account Examiner communicates 

immediately to the concerned FO for the necessary correction/adjustment.      

 

At the end of each month, after which the transactions are recognized in the 

books, the ending balance of the Cash in Bank Foreign Currency accounts as 

appearing in the MSWF peso equivalent should tally with the corresponding SL 

balances for a particular month.    

 

As at year-end, the balance of the Cash in Bank-Foreign Currency accounts 

amounted to ₱9,479,002,354.72 broken down as follows: 

 

Account Title Amount (₱) 

Cash in Bank-Foreign Currency, Current Account         9,125,009,302.72  

Cash in Bank-Foreign Currency, Savings Account     353,993,051.99  

Total 9,479,002,354.72  

 

Verification of SLs disclosed several bank accounts with negative balances in 

the name of FOs and SLs with no details as to bank name and account number 

amounting to ₱252,873,986.17 that significantly affected the reliability of the Cash 

in Bank-Foreign Currency accounts.   



54 
 

These negative balances were attributed to erroneous postings, erroneous 

account classification and delayed recording of transactions that could have been 

detected through careful analysis and review of transactions.  It was worth 

mentioning that the total negative balances had decreased from the previous year’s 

balance of ₱533,146,919.86 to ₱252,873,986.17 of this year, an indication on the best 

efforts made by the Accountant to reconcile the balances.  

 

A number of SL balances aggregating ₱6,242,692.08 had no complete details 

as to the specific name of bank and account number.  Only the names of accountable 

FOs and the respective Posts were indicated in the SLs, thus, verification could not 

be facilitated. 

 

We also noted that some of the negative balances and unidentified bank 

balances pertained to accountabilities of previously assigned FOs who were already 

recalled and/or reassigned to other posts.  Other SLs carried unmoving normal and 

negative balances of various FOs that increase/decrease the balance of bank accounts 

of the Posts.  Most likely that previous turnover of accountabilities between the 

incoming and outgoing FOs were not effected in the books.   

 

Of the total 94 Posts, only 47 FRs as of December 31, 2020 were submitted 

to the Audit Team.  Our verification of the submitted FRs revealed that there were 

about 14 bank accounts with SL balances but not among the reported bank accounts 

of the current FO, hence, were not maintained by the Posts.  We also noted these were 

account balances of the former FOs, to wit:

It was a standard practice in the DFA that when a particular post is closed the 

balance of the cash in bank was transferred to the nearest post, however, per 

verification, there were still bank accounts of closed Posts which had been 

outstanding in the SLs aggregating ₱2,490,165.06. This is an indication that the 

transfer of bank balances to the nearest posts was not recognized by the Accountant.

Our review also disclosed some discrepancies in bank name and account 

numbers between the bank statements/bank reconciliation statements and the details 

in the SLs which remained uncorrected to date. 

  

Further, we compared the SWF prepared by the FSA with the Schedule of SL 

balances and a number of them did not tally. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant 

to: 

 

a. continue to exert best effort to analyze and verify the details of unidentified 
bank accounts, negative balances, bank accounts of closed Posts and make 

appropriate adjustments in the books; 

 

b. reconcile accounting records with the Posts’ financial reports to ensure the 
completeness/correctness of the recorded bank accounts and to do away with 

maintaining SLs for non-existing bank accounts; 

 

c. ensure that all details in the SLs are correct as to the bank name and account 
number to facilitate verification and reconciliation; and 

 

d. maintain one SL per bank account instead of per FO to prevent abnormal 
balances of cash in bank accounts in instances where transfer of 

accountability from an outgoing to an incoming FO were not effected in the 

books. 

 

 

Unremitted dormant FSP bank account balances 

 

3. Failure to remit the balance of dormant accounts to the National Treasury 
resulted in the incurrence of bank charges and losses on foreign exchange 



57 
 

totaling ₱10,462,322.74 for the last three years alone, from CY 2018 balance of 

₱170,667,646.22 that decreased to ₱160,205,323.48 in CY 2020. 

 

Listed on the table below are dormant bank accounts that should have already 

been closed and remitted to the Bureau of Treasury.  We noticed the decrease in the 

balances of these bank accounts due to incurrence of bank charges and losses on 

foreign exchange.

It has been the subject of our previous years’ recommendation to remit the 

dormant accounts to the National Treasury, however, no effort on the part of the 

agency to facilitate reconciliation of accounts to avoid continued incurrence of losses.  

 

We reiterated our previous years’ recommendation and Management 

agreed to require the concerned Posts, PCGs Osaka and Tokyo to facilitate the 

reconciliation of their accounts with DOLE, after which, consider the closing of 

these dormant bank accounts to avoid incurrence of losses and remit to the 

National Treasury to augment the funds to be used by the government for its 

priority projects.

Unreliable balance of account Due from NGAs 

 

4. The Due from NGAs balance of ₱779,182,772.96 was unreliable due to: (a) 
discrepancy of ₱121,633,697.88 between DFA records and counterparties; (b) 

unidentified/unclassified SL balances amounting to ₱161,916,959.90; (c) SLs 

with negative balances totaling ₱18,918,030.14; (d) understatement of the 

account balance by ₱14,407,472.73 due to erroneous recording of fund transfer; 

and (e) long outstanding receivables aged from three to more than ten years 

aggregating to ₱999,381,647.97. 

 

As of December 31, 2020, the account Due from NGAs showed a balance of 

₱779,182,772.96, broken down as follows: 

 

Fund Amount (₱) 

Regular Agency 778,930,806.97 

Passport Revolving 251,923.28 

Trust 42.71 

Total 779,182,772.96 

  

The accounts covered receivables from other agencies for funds transferred 

by DFA, advance payments to the Procurement Service (PS) for supplies and 

equipment, and shares in utilities and other expenses incurred by the agencies’ 

offices/representatives based in the FSPs. 

 

Analysis of accounts disclosed the following deficiencies: 

 

Discrepancy between the records of DFA and counterparties 

 

Confirmation letters were sent to 29 out of 62 NGAs to validate the 

correctness of receivables with aggregate outstanding balance of ₱357,634,248.21 as 

at December 31, 2020. Of the 17 respondents, not a single agency agreed with the 

balances reflected in their SLs for a total variance of ₱121,633,697.88, summarized

The total discrepancy of ₱121,633,697.88 accounted for 15.61 percent of the 

balance of the Due from NGAs account at year-end, of which 87.84 percent pertains 

to the variance with the PS of ₱106,847,829.23. This condition reflected inadequate 

efforts of management in reconciling their accounting records with other agencies 

especially with the PS rendering the account’s balance unreliable. 

 

Unclassified Balances 

 

Despite previous years’ audit recommendations, the SL account recorded in 

the books as “Others” with a balance of ₱161,916,959.90 since 2007 remained 

unadjusted as of December 31, 2020. 

 

Management’s failure to support and identify the said SL account which 

comprised 20.78 percent of the balance of account Due from NGAs added to the 

unreliability of the balance at year-end. 

 

Negative Balances and Erroneous Recording 

 

We also noted the existence of SL accounts with negative balances 

aggregating to ₱18,918,030.14 which reduced the general ledger (GL) account 

balance at year-end. Aside from abnormal balances that have been outstanding prior 

to system migration, negative balances were primarily due to accounting errors and 

omissions such as failure in setting up of receivables and instances where recorded 

collections were greater than the booked receivables. 

 

Analysis of accounts showed that 76.16 percent of the abnormal balance 

pertains to the negative SL account balance of the Department of Health (DOH) 

amounting to ₱14,407,472.73.  Further verification disclosed that the negative SL 

balance of DOH was due to the erroneous recording of funds received from the DOH 

in July 2020 amounting to ₱20,263,620.83 for the conduct COVID-19 swab tests 

using RT-PCR for 5,300 Filipinos in the Temporary Detention Centers in Sabah. 

 

The funds received were credited under account Due from NGAs. During the 

year a total of ₱5,856,148.10 was utilized by the Philippine Embassy in Kuala 



60 
 

Lumpur for the said purpose, leaving a balance of ₱14,407,472.73. The amount of 

disbursements was charged against Due from NGAs, thus the SL account of DOH 

posted a negative balance of ₱14,407,472.73 at year-end. 

 

Per GAM Volume III, the account Due to NGAs is used to recognize receipt 

of funds for delivery of goods/services as authorized by law, fund transfers form 

NGAs, other than the BIR, for implementation of specific programs or projects and 

other inter-agency transactions. This account is debited for delivery of 

goods/services, liquidation of funds received and settlement of liabilities. 

 

Had the above fund transfer recorded under the correct account Due to NGAs, 

the negative SL account balance of DOH should have been avoided.  The erroneous 

entries for said transaction understated the accounts Due from NGAs and Due to 

NGAs both by ₱14,407,472.73 at year-end. 

 

Abnormal SL balances greatly affect the reliability of the accounts presented 

in the financial statements. It also indicates lack of effort in analyzing the flow of 

each account’s transactions as abnormal balances signifies errors and omissions 

which should be addressed immediately at their onset. 

 

Long Outstanding Balances 

 

Furthermore, aging of the account revealed that a total of ₱999,381,647.97 

remained outstanding for more than three years wherein ₱190,305,399.79 pertains to 

accounts aged over 10 years, to wit:

Total 566,722,019.46 242,354,228.72 190,305,399.79 999,381,647.97 

 

It can be noted that the total long outstanding balances even exceeded the GL 

account balance of ₱779,182,772.96.   This was due to accounts with abnormal 

balances that remained unreconciled and unadjusted through the years. 

 

The existence of long outstanding balances affected the fair presentation of 

the account in the financial statements due to the probability of unrecorded 

liquidations and collections, as well as the remote possibility of settlements, since 

majority of these receivables particularly those aged over 10 years pertain to 

beginning balances established upon conversion to e-NGAS. It also indicated 

inadequate monitoring and laxity in the enforcement of liquidation of fund transfers 

and collection/settlement of receivables. 

 



61 
 

We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations and Management 

agreed to require the Chief Accountant to: 

 

a. exert more effort to reconcile the discrepancies between the records of DFA 
and concerned agencies to establish the correct balance of the accounts; 

 

b. intensify the verification/analysis and location of related records and 
supporting documents of unidentified/unsupported balances; 

 

c. review and analyze the negative balances and effect necessary adjustments 
for erroneous entries and be mindful of the resulting abnormal balances for 

it signify accounting errors and omissions that could affect the correctness 

of the reported balances; and 

 

d. send demand letters supported with relevant reference documents to 
implementing/debtor agencies to liquidate/settle their accounts. Analyze the 

accounts aged 10 years and above if the balances had been unmoving or 

dormant, and request for write-off from the Commission on Audit (COA) in 

accordance with the guidelines and procedures prescribed under the COA 

Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to instruct the 

Accountant to adjust the erroneous entries in accounting for the funds 

transferred by DOH. 

 

 

Unreconciled intra-agency reciprocal accounts 

 

5. The balance of reciprocal accounts Due from Other Funds and Due to Other 
Funds at year-end totaling ₱9,394,732.69 and ₱1,002,258.71, respectively, 

showed a variance of ₱8,392,473.98, thereby, casting doubt on the correctness 

and reliability of the balances. 

 

As of December 31, 2020, the reciprocal accounts Due from Other Funds and 

Due to Other Funds showed a balance of ₱9,394,732.69 and ₱1,002,258.71, 

respectively, broken down as follows: 

 

Fund Due from Other 

Funds (₱) 

Due to Other 

Funds (₱) 

Regular Agency Fund (RAF) 6,002,624.88 20,000.00 

Passport Revolving Fund (PRF) 3,327,603.01 656,119.50 

Trust Fund (TF) 64,504.80 326,139.21 

Total 9,394,732.69 1,002,258.71 

Difference 8,392,473.98 

 



62 
 

Chapter 3 of the GAM Volume 3 (updated 2019) prescribes account Due from 

Other Funds to recognize transfers to other funds and/or receivables from other funds 

of the agency and credited for receipt of payment, liquidation, write-off, and/or 

adjustments; and account Due to Other Funds to recognize transfers from other funds 

and/or payables to other funds and is debited for the return of the fund to the source 

fund, and/or adjustments. 

 

The Due from/to Other Funds are considered reciprocal accounts, thus, their 

total outstanding balances for all funds should be equal at year-end, since a debit to 

one account must have a counterpart credit to the other account and vice versa. 

 

Analysis disclosed, however, that the balances of the two accounts were not 

reconciled or a difference of ₱8,392,473.98 at year-end. 

 

The balance of account Due from Other Funds under RAF of ₱6,002,624.88 

included a prior year reclassification from account Due from Central Office in 2016 

which is also the beginning balance in the amount of ₱5,798,624.88 and since then 

have remained unreconciled. 

 

The account Due from Other Funds under PRF with a balance of 

₱3,327,603.01 consisted of the following: 

 

Particulars Amount (₱) 

Salaries of newly appointed regular and home-based 

employees 

2,380,928.08 

Reclassification from Due from Central Office account in 2016 439,324.93 

Reclassification from Other Receivables account in 2017 487,350.00 

Hazard pay allowance of regular employees for CY 2020 20,000.00 

Total  3,327,603.01 

 

On the other hand, the account Due to Other Funds under RAF and TF yielded 

an aggregate balance of ₱346,139.21 which is only 10.40 percent of the Due from 

Other Funds (PRF) account balance.  Notable discrepancy is on RAF balance of only 

₱20,000.00, representing hazard pay allowance of regular employees paid under 

PRF, considering that the bulk of the Due from Other Funds balance under PRF were 

attributed to salaries of newly appointed regular employees who were previously on 

contractual status whose salaries were drawn from PRF. 

 

Review of transactions and inquiry from Accounting personnel disclosed that 

receivables from RAF pertaining to the salaries of newly appointed regular and home 

based employees paid by PRF were booked under the account Due from Other Funds 

of PRF, while for RAF the payables to PRF were recorded under the Other Payables 

account instead of Due to Other Funds, thus the discrepancy of balances between the 

reciprocal accounts. 

 



63 
 

The non-reconciliation of reciprocal accounts at year-end affected the 

reliability of the balances presented in the financial statements. 

 

We recommend and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant to analyze and reconcile the balances of the reciprocal accounts 

especially those of prior years, and effect necessary adjustments to eliminate the 

difference. 

 

 

Incorrect method of costing Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory 

 

6. The costing method used for the Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers 
Inventory was not based on their specific individual costs, contrary to Chapter 

8, Section 5, GAM Volume I, resulting to net understatements of the inventory 

and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts by ₱1,975,630.22, affecting the fair 

presentation of accounts in the financial statements. 

 

GAM Volume I, Chapter 2, Section 4 (h), states that Pre-numbered Official 

Receipts (ORs) shall be issued in strict numerical sequence. In addition, Chapter 8, 

Section 5, states that the cost of inventories of items that are not ordinarily 

interchangeable, and goods or services produced and segregated for specific projects, 

shall be assigned by using the specific identification of their individual costs. For 

interchangeable items, cost is determined using the weighted average cost formula. 

 

ORs and other pre-numbered accountable forms are considered non-

interchangeable items. Analysis of the subsidiary accounts of Accountable Forms, 

Plates and Stickers Inventory disclosed that the weighted average method was used 

for costing these inventories contrary to the preceding provision that cost shall be 

assigned by using the specific identification of their individual costs. Details are 

shown below:

TOTAL  (1,975,630.22) 



64 
 

The incorrect method of costing applied in the above inventory items 

understated both the Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory and the 

Accumulated Surplus/Deficit accounts by ₱1,975,630.22. 

 

We recommended that Management require the Accountant to draw a 

JEV to correct the misstatement of the accounts. 

 

Management commented that the inventory account was understated as a 

result of applying specific identification costing method by the Auditor. However, 

unless otherwise revised, the Department will continue to adopt the costing method 

under e-NGAS Ver.1.2.2 (Basic Features and Manual), as follows: 

 

a. Inventory system and costing for Supplies and Materials is automatically 
computed on the basis of Weighted Average on the date of issue (e-NGAS 

Ver.1.2.2 Basic Features); and 

 

b. Moving average method of costing for costing inventories on the basis of 
weighted average on the date of issue (Chapter 1 Section 44 of the e-

NGAS Manual). 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

We referred the matter with the Government Accountancy Sector of COA but 

have yet to receive their expert opinion. 

 

 

Obsolete blank passports 

 

7. Obsolete blank passports recognized as Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers 
Inventory account estimated at ₱174,289,540.82 were not subjected to allowance 

for impairment contrary to the Revised Charts of Accounts Volume III 

(Updated 2019), thus overstating the book value of the reported inventories and 

the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) by the same amount. 

 

The Commission on Audit issued COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 

8, 2020 prescribing Volume III-Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) to replace 

Volume III, The Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2015) of the GAM for NGAs.   

 

Under the revised Chart of Account, Allowance for Impairment- Accountable 

Forms is prescribed to credit for the initial or subsequent write-down of Accountable 

Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory due to fortuitous events, pest and other similar 

infestations.  This account is debited upon disposal, derecognition, of the inventory 

for consumption, reversal of impairment loss and/or adjustments. 

 

Further, Impairment Loss-Inventories is debited to recognize the loss in the 

future economic benefits or service potential of inventory.  This account is credited, 



65 
 

at year-end, to close to the Revenue and Expense Summary account and/or 

adjustments. 

 

In compliance with the recommended standards set forth by the International 

Civil Aviation organization (ICAO) and the need to secure the integrity of Philippine 

passport by adopting technological developments in the production and security of 

ePassports, the DFA shifted to the issuance of personalized ePassports. 

Consequently, unissued blank passports were no longer used and became obsolete.  

 

Analysis of the schedule of accountable forms supporting the GL balance 

revealed a total of 465,367 blank passports aggregating ₱174,289,540.82 

representing obsolete unissued blank passports but still recognized in the agency 

books as at year-end. Details are as follows: 

 

Blank Passports Quantity Amount (₱) 

Diplomatic Passport - Blue (ePassport) 11,666 7,336,162.30  

Diplomatic Passport - Blue (MRP-eFormat)         1,606  341,756.80  

Official Passport - Red (ePassport) 16,629 10,489,490.97  

Regular Passport - Green (32-Page Regular) 2,428          595,369.88  

Regular Passport - Green (64-Page) 87 22,693.78  

Regular Passport - Maroon (ePassport) 161,401 75,396,817.09  

Regular Passport - Maroon (MRP w/o IC Chips)     269,550 79,517,250.00  

Regular Passport - MRCTD 2,000 590,000.00  

TOTAL  465,367 174,289,540.82  

 

We noted that no allowance for impairment was provided for these inventory 

items contrary to the prescribed Revised Chart of Accounts (updated 2019). 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant to draw a JEV to recognize allowance for impairment for the 

obsolete inventories in conformity with the Revised Chart of Account (updated 

2019). 

 

Management commented that coordination with Office of Asset Management 

and Support Services (OAMSS) and OCA is ongoing to provide the necessary 

supporting documents for the proper disposition of the outdated blank passports. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team will monitor the provision of allowance for impairment and 

the disposition of the outdated blank passports.

Unreliable balances of accounts Land, Buildings and Other Structures 

 

8. Land and Buildings identified in the RPCPPE of DFA FSPs were not recognized 
in the accounting books of accounts, thus understating the property accounts by 

an estimated value of ₱1,240,454,054.34. Moreover, existence of 

unclassified/unidentified SLs aggregating to ₱607,768,012.47, renders the 

accounts Land, Buildings and Other Structures unreliable. 

 

GAM Volume 1, Chapter 10, Section 38 states that the periodic physical count 

of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the RPCPPE as at December 

31 of each year. This shall be submitted to the Auditor concerned not later than 

January 31 of the following year. Equipment found at station and losses discovered 

during the physical count shall be reported to the Accounting Division/Unit for proper 

accounting/recording. 

 

Under Section 42, item g, further describes RPCPPE as a form that shall be 

used to report the physical count and condition of PPE by type as at a given date, 

including those which are unrecorded and those which could not be accounted for. It 

shows the balance of PPE per property cards and per count and the shortage/overage, 

if any. It shall be rendered by the Inventory Committee, on its yearly physical count 

of properties owned by the entity. 

 

Under Section 5 of the same provision, measurement at recognition, states 

that an item of PPE that qualifies for recognition as an asset shall be measured at cost. 

However, where the PPE is acquired through a non-exchange transaction, its cost 

shall be measured at its fair value as at the date of acquisition. 

 

There were 65 Diplomatic and Consular Government-Owned Properties 

administered by DFA that were successfully obtained documentation. They 

published a book regarding the properties entitled “Storeys of Diplomacy: Stories 

and Register of Philippine Overseas Government-Owned Properties”, through the 

effort of the OAMSS. The published book covers the nature of the properties, 

acquisition/construction cost, date of acquisition/construction, mode of acquisition, 

estimated value and date of valuation, including the renovations made to the 

properties.  

 

The consolidated year-end balances of accounts Land, Buildings, and Other 

Structures amounting to ₱7,098,390,559.02 under the RAF and PRF are as follows:

The estimated peso values were derived from various currency exchange rates 

from year 1958 to 2019, to meet the measurement at recognition, which is the cost at 

the date of acquisition. 

 

The non-recording of the 14 identified properties understated the PPE 
accounts by an estimated value of ₱1,240,454,054.34. Moreover, the non-recording 

of buildings impedes the recognition of depreciation expenses.

Included in the year-end balances were SLs that were not properly identified,

While there existed the above unidentified/unclassified PPE, there is 

possibility that some of these are among the unrecognized PPE, hence proper 

reconciliation/identification should be made. 

 

The improper identification and classification of accounts affects the 

reliability of PPE, and the accuracy of monthly computation of depreciation 

expenses. 

 

We recommend and Management agreed to require the Chief 

Accountant to: 

 

a. coordinate with OAMSS for the reconciliation of properties that were not 
properly identified and/or classified;   

 

b. record the appropriate value of the properties that were identified and 
included in the RPCPPE but unrecorded in the accounting books, based on 

the acquisition cost or appraised value of the properties, taking into 

consideration the unclassified/others/for reconciliation PPE, for the fair 

presentation of Land, Buildings, and Other Structures accounts. Record 

separately the cost of land and buildings acquired together; and 

 

c. prepare the necessary adjustments for the Accumulated Depreciation and 
Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) of the unrecorded properties.

Unreliable balance of account Construction in Progress and related PPE accounts 

 

9. Fully paid and completed contracts/projects aggregating ₱920,840,393.21 
recognized as CIP-Buildings and Other Structures account were not classified 

to proper PPE accounts contrary to GAM Volumes I and III, resulting in 

overstatement of CIP-Buildings and Other Structures by ₱920,840,393.21 and 

understatement of Buildings and Other Structures accounts by the same 

amount.  Moreover, failure to reclassify the account caused the non-recognition 

of depreciation expenses and accumulated depreciation, thus 

overstating/understating the accounts Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) and 

Accumulated Depreciation accounts by undetermined amounts. 

 

GAM Volume III describes CIP–Building and Other Structures account is 

used to recognize the accumulated cost or other appropriate value of buildings and 

other structures which are still in the process of construction or development. The 

account is credited for reclassification to appropriate Buildings and Other Structures 

account upon completion.  

 

GAM Volume I, Chapter 10, Section 27 states that PPE gradually loses its 

ability to provide service over the course of time. Depreciation of an asset begins 

when it is available for use such as when it is in the location and condition necessary 

for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. 

 

Under Section 47, the procedures in the construction of PPE by contract, 

Sequence No. 12-Final Billing:  the bill of the creditor, Project Management Team’s 

Certification of 100% Completion and Final Acceptance, among others should be 

attached to the DV. 

 

DFA FSPs were authorized to construct buildings and acquire properties to 

house the Chancery and to serve as the official residence of the heads of posts. Due 

to wear and tear, some of the acquired properties undergo repairs or renovation to 

accommodate and serve Filipinos abroad. 

 

The CIP–Building and Other Structures account had a balance of 

₱3,552,204,571.42 as of December 31, 2020. This consisted of various repairs, 

renovations, and constructions of various facilities in FSPs and in the Home Office.  

 

Verification of accounting records revealed that various projects/contracts 

were already fully paid. According to the given provisions, one of the supporting 

documents attached to final payment is the Certification of 100% Completion and 

Final Acceptance together with copies of contract, original ORs, etc.  This document 

would be the basis for the Accountant to reclassify the CIP to the proper account 

classification.  

 

Hence, these projects were already completed and turned-over to the 

respective Posts but were not monitored at the Home Office and no effort were 



70 
 

exerted to verify their status. Most likely that the projects were already in use 

considering the length of time they remained and treated as CIP in the books. 

 

As of year-end, the following completed projects were not yet reclassified to 

the appropriate PPE accounts:

The non-reclassification to proper PPE accounts resulted in understatement of 

accounts Buildings and Other Structures aggregating ₱920,840,393.31 and 

overstatement of account CIP-Buildings and Other Structures by the same amount.   

 

Moreover, the non-classification of accounts caused the non-recognition of 

the corresponding depreciation expenses, thus understating the accumulated 

depreciation and overstating the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts by 

undetermined amounts. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

 

a. reclassify all completed projects to its proper PPE account classification duly 
supported by Certification of 100 percent Completion and Final Acceptance; 

 

b. compute the corresponding Accumulated Depreciation for all Buildings and 
Other Structures and Office Equipment reclassified in the process; and 

 

c. monitor the accomplishment/status of CIP projects more specifically at 
Foreign Posts. 

 

 

Unreliable balance of account Advances for Operating Expenses  

 

10. The balance of the account Advances for Operating Expenses in the amount of 
₱29,651,246.54 was highly unreliable due to existence of accounts with negative 

balances totaling ₱210,590,998.66 and normal account balances which were not 

moving for more than 10 years aggregating ₱188,062,014.68. 

 

It was worth mentioning that the account Advances for Operating Expenses 

did not exist in the old chart of accounts before the issuance of Manual on the 

National Government Accounting System (MNGAS) promulgated under COA 

Circular No. 2002-002 dated June 18, 2002. Working funds in the FSPs were 

recognized then as Cash-Disbursing Officers (8-70-500).  This account consisted of 

undeposited collections and cash in bank for the operational requirements of the FSPs 

under the accountability of the FO. 

 

With the issuance of MNGAS which took effect on January 1, 2002, this 

account was reclassified as Cash- Disbursing Officer (107) and the cash in bank were 

reclassified as Cash in Bank Foreign Currency Current Account (113)/ Foreign 

Currency Savings Account (114). 

 

Under the Revised Chart of Account (updated 2015), the account Cash- 

Disbursing Officer was further reclassified as Advances for Operating Expenses, 

Advances for Payroll, Advances to Special Disbursing Officer and Advances to 

Officers and Employees.  

 



73 
 

GAM Volume III (updated 2019), prescribes that Advances for Operating 

Expenses, is the account debited to recognize the amount of advances granted to 

accountable officers (AOs) for payment of operating expenses of operating field/units 

and foreign branch office not maintaining complete set of books of account and is 

credited upon liquidation, write-off, and/or adjustments. 

 

As of year-end the reported balance of the account Advances for Operating 

Expenses amounted to ₱29,651,246.54 consisted of the following: 

 

Particulars Amount (₱) 

SLs with normal balances 240,242,245.20 

SLs with negative balances (210,590,998.66) 

 General Ledger Balance as of 12/31/2020 29,651,246.54 

 

Verification showed that out of the normal balances of ₱240,242,245.20 a 

total of ₱188,062,014.68 pertained to SLs of prior years which were not moving for 

more than 10 years.   

 

Most of the negative balances amounted to millions of pesos which had a 

material effect on the correctness of the reported balance as of year-end. Also 

included in these balances were SL Nos. 19901010-00-OTH-UCD, 19901010-00-

HO-UCD, and 19901010-00-RC-OTH-UCD with unknown AO and recorded only 

as “Unclassified” with balances of (₱20,509,640.21), ₱109,130.95 and 

₱2,278,329.54, respectively.  The balances of these SLs were the reconciling amounts 

between the GL and the total SL accounts during the conversion from manual to 

electronic accounting system.  These remained unreconciled as at year-end. 

 

It was also noted that some of the AOs were already retired, resigned or 

deceased, some were assigned to different FSPs, however, their accountabilities from 

the previous posts of assignment remained outstanding, an indication that no effort 

was made on the part of the Accounting Division to reconcile these huge balances. 

 

Due to non-availability of records the Audit Team was not able to verify the 

SLs particularly those pertaining to CY 2002 and below. However, we tried to verify 

the other affected accounts relative to the conversion of the chart of accounts and we 

found out that while there were some SLs with long-outstanding unliquidated 

balances, there existed SLs of the same AO under the account Cash in Bank-Foreign 

Currency, Current/Savings Account which showed negative/abnormal balances.  

Shown below are some of the SLs:

74 
 

The above SLs under the cash in bank accounts did not specify the bank 

account numbers but only the name of the AO which we found unusual.  These 

abnormal balances of the cash accounts would not be possible since it would mean 

the disbursement was beyond the bank balance which was very unlikely.  The AOs 

of these accounts were recalled to the Home Office and assigned to another post of 

assignment after a certain period of time.  The above balances could entail accounting 

errors in the conversion of accounts and in the accounting of disbursements. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant 

to: 

 

a. exert more efforts to reconcile these abnormal balances and the accounts 
which are not moving for more than 10 years and draw JEV to adjust the 

accounting errors found in the process; and 

 

b. be mindful on the abnormal balances of the accounts for possible accounting 
errors that needed to be adjusted accordingly. 

 

 

Unliquidated Advances for LQA  

 

11. Failure of the AOs to liquidate advances for LQA as they fall due and the failure 
of the FO to report the liquidation and the Accountant to monitor liquidation of 

cash advances resulted to accumulation of unliquidated balance of 

₱14,280,470.24.  

 

LQA is granted to Foreign Service personnel, who are citizens of the 

Philippines, to enable them to rent and maintain quarters befitting their representative 

capacities 

 

Under Section 172 of Department Order No. 19A-95 of the Regulation of the 

DFA, payment of LQA accrues on the first day of the month following the date of 

arrival at the post and ceases at the end of the month following departure at the end 

of the tour of duty.  In other cases of departure from post due to resignation, 

retirement, death or separation from the service, the allowance shall cease at the end 

of the month during which the officer or employee resigns, retires, dies or is separated 

from the service. 

 

Section 175 provided further that adjusted full allowance based on rank and 

actual family status at the post corresponding to the first three months from the 

accrual of the allowance may be commuted without prior authority from the 

Department.   

 

Payment of advance rental or deposit equivalent to at least six months to one 

year’s rental may also be allowed when it is customary of standard practices of the 

post of assignment requiring advance rental. 



75 
 

Advance payments of LQA were recognized in the Accounting records as 

Advances to Officers and Employees. To liquidate the cash advances, AOs are 

required to prepare liquidation reports as the LQA falls due.  The FO, on the other 

hand, prepares the Memo Journal Entry (MJE) for these LRs and submit to the Home 

Office together with the Fiscal reports.  The Foreign Service Accounting analyzes the 

Fiscal reports and prepares the corresponding JEVs for the proper accounting of the 

FSPs transactions. 

 

As of year-end the balance of the account amounted to ₱108,244,443.38, out 

of which a total of ₱14,280,470.24 pertained to advances for LQA. Analysis of the 

SLs disclosed that cash advances comprising this amount were granted from years 

1978 to 2019.  We also noted that some of the AOs were no longer connected with 

the DFA, however, their cash advances remained outstanding in the accounting 

records, an indication of lack of monitoring of cash advance on the part of the FO 

and the Accountant. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a. AOs to liquidate immediately the cash advances as they fall due; 
 

b. FO and the Accountant to strictly monitor liquidation of cash advances and 
report/record immediately the liquidations pertaining to the particular 

period; and  

 

c. Accountant to coordinate with the Human Resource Management Office the 
Post of assignment for the actual tour of duty of those AOs who are no longer 

in the service and draw necessary JEV to recognize the liquidation 

corresponding to the period the cash advances were granted. 

 

 

Negative SL balances for account Advances to Officers and Employees 

 

12. Failure of the Accountant to recognize the cash advances upon payment to 
AOs/lessors resulted in negative balances of SLs upon liquidation of the 

advances, thus, understating the accounts Advances to Officers and Employees 

and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) by ₱6,661,665.50. 

 

SLs supporting the accounts Advances to Officers and Employees in the GL 

as of year-end showed balances as follows: 

 

Particulars Amount (₱) 

SLs with normal balances 139,916,746.89 

SLs with negative balances (31,672,303.51) 

 General Ledger Balance as of 12/31/2020 108,244,443.38 

 



76 
 

Officials and employees of the FSPs are allowed to commute equivalent to 

three-month LQA accruing on the first day of the month following arrival.  In some 

countries where the FSP is located, advance rental from six months to one year may 

be allowed if it is the standard operating practices among the lessors to require 

advance rental, provided that the amount was payable directly to the lessor. In these 

two instances, advance payments were recognized as Advances to Officers and 

Employees and liquidated as they fall due.   

 

In the FSPs where there were restrictions or limited bank transactions caused 

by political conflicts and unstable peace and order, FOs were allowed to draw cash 

advances for the payment of salaries of local hires, allowances of FSP personnel, and 

other operating expenses. These advances were recognized as Advances for 

Operating Expenses.  Upon liquidation, the advance payments for overseas 

allowances were recognized as Advances to Officers and Employees.  

 

One of the identified causes of the negative balances on the SL of AOs is the 

recording of liquidation without the corresponding debits to cash advances.  On a test 

basis, we analyzed some of the SLs with negative/abnormal balances and we noted a 

total of ₱6,661,665.50 recorded liquidations without the corresponding debits to cash 

advance.  The resulting negative balances were attributed to accounting errors of 

directly recognizing the expenses instead of cash advance upon payment to the 

officials and employees/lessors. 

 

This accounting errors understated the accounts Advances to Officers and 

Employees and Accumulated Surplus /(Deficit) by the same amount. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant 

to: 

 

a. correct the understatement of accounts for a more reliable account balances; 
and 

 

b. analyze each SLs regularly and be watchful of the abnormal balances of the 
accounts to detect immediately accounting errors that needs to be adjusted. 

 

Management partially adjusted the accounts and submitted to the Audit Team 

a list of JEVs prepared. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder: 

 

The Audit Team will validate/verify the JEVs in the list submitted and 

monitor progress of analysis/reconciliation of accounts.

Unreliable balance of Accounts Payable account 

 

13. The Accounts Payable (A/P) balance of ₱837,741,345.40 under RAF was 
unreliable due to: (a) accounts outstanding for more than two years of 

₱218,212,887.29; (b) unidentified accounts of ₱64,212,524.53; (c) existence of 

accounts with abnormal balances aggregating to ₱16,148,742.33; (d) variance of 

₱12,845,258.52 between SL and confirmed balances from creditors; (e) dormant 

accounts of ₱16,630,946.80; (f) maintenance of multiple SL accounts of 

suppliers/creditors; and (g) double-booking on the set-up of payables totaling 

₱31,498.75. Moreover, the validity of A/P set up in CY 2020 with outstanding 

balance of ₱511,290,971.25 at year-end cannot be ascertained due to non-

submission of supporting documents. 
 

Accounts Payable as described in Section 2 Chapter 6 of the GAM, Volume 

I, refers to valid and legal obligations of National Government Agencies 

(NGAs)/Operating Units (OUs), for which, goods/services/projects have been 

delivered/rendered/completed and accepted, regardless of the year when these 

obligations were incurred. 

 

As of December 31, 2020, A/P under RAF showed a balance of 

₱837,741,345.40, broken down as follows: 

 

Station/Post Amount (₱) 

Home Office 435,145,687.78 

Regional Consular Offices 1,355,479.41 

Foreign Service Posts 401,035,071.04 

Others 205,107.17 

Total 837,741,345.40 

  

Analysis of accounts disclosed the following deficiencies: 

 

Outstanding for more than two years 

 

Section 98 of PD No. 1445 states that the Commission upon notice to the head 

of agency concerned may revert to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund of 

the national government, any unliquidated balance of accounts payable in the books 

of the national government, which has been outstanding for two years or more and 

against which no actual claim, administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is 

not covered by perfected contracts on record. 

 

The above regulation was reiterated under EO No. 109 dated June 18, 1999, 

and its implementing guidelines per DBM- COA Joint Circular No. 99-6 dated 

November 13, 1999 which provides among others that all documented accounts 

payable of all funds which have remained outstanding for two years, except on-going 

capital outlay projects; and all undocumented A/P regardless of the year they were 



78 
 

incurred, shall be reverted to the Cumulative Results of Operations (CRO), called at 

present as Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit). 

 

EO No. 87 was also issued directing that all A/P which remain outstanding 

for two years or more in the books of NGAs be reverted to the Accumulated Surplus 

or Deficit of the General Fund, or the CRO of the National Government.  While its 

implementing guidelines were issued on March 8, 2021 per COA-DBM Joint 

Circular No. 1, s. 2021, the EO took effect on August 13, 2019 with the following 

provisions: 

 

Section 1- All documented A/P for fiscal year 2016 and years prior thereto 

shall be reverted to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund, 

or the CRO of the National Government.  Henceforth, all documented A/P 

which remain outstanding for at least two years, for which no actual 

administrative or judicial claim has been filed, shall be subject to automatic 

reversion. 

 

Section 2 – All A/P which are undocumented or not covered by perfected 

contracts on record, regardless of the year in which they were incurred, shall 

automatically be reverted.  The recording of undocumented A/P in the books 

of accounts of agencies shall be strictly prohibited. 

 

Review of the aging schedule of A/P as of December 31, 2020 showed that 

₱221,919,455.19 or 26.49 percent of the account balance had been outstanding for 

more than two years and were not reverted contrary to the above-cited regulations.  

 

Unidentified/unsupported A/Ps 

 

In our CY 2019 AAR, we reported that the account balance of A/P included 

unidentified/unsupported SL accounts with a total balance of ₱64,212,524.53. 

Monitoring of the said SL accounts which accounted for 7.66 percent of the AP 

account balance, disclosed that these remained unreconciled/unadjusted as of 

December 31, 2020, to wit:

Various Creditors 20101010-00-PE-BB-1238 78,000.00 

Total 64,212,524.53 

 

Negative Balances 

 

As in previous years, SL accounts with negative balances still exist in the 

books aggregating to ₱16,148,742.33 which reduced the GL account balance at year-

end. Verification showed that the SL accounts have no corresponding credits or A/P 

set-up prior to disbursements or payments exceeded the payable set up, thus, the 



79 
 

abnormal balance, while others were due to accounting errors such as set-up of 

payable on wrong account, double entry on payments, multiple SL accounts for a 

supplier/creditor, and difference on foreign exchange conversion. 

 

Discrepancies with Creditors’ Records 

 

Confirmation letters were sent to 38 creditors with total outstanding balance 

of ₱357,634,248.21 as at December 31, 2020. However, only nine replied with four 

confirming their SL balances while five disagreed for a variance of ₱12,845,258.52, 

summarized as follows:

Analysis of these SLs disclosed that discrepancies were due to payments 

made that were not yet recorded in the books, payments made in January 2021 and 

payables in prior years. 

 

Dormant Accounts 

 

COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 5, 1997 sets the guidelines on the 

proper disposition/closure of dormant accounts of National Government Agencies. It 

describes dormant accounts as individual or group of accounts whose balances 

remained non-moving for more than five years. 

 

Pertinent provisions of the above circular for dormant A/Ps require the 

Accountant and other officials concerned to undertake the following: 

 

a. Dormant accounts in an active fund shall be reviewed, analyzed and reconciled 
together with the other related accounts in the trial balance. 

 



80 
 

b. Determine proper disposition of reconciled and validated accounts whether 
settlement of all liabilities and/or reversion/adjustment of same to the CRO 

account. 

 

c. If the analysis/review of the accounts is not possible due to absence of records 
and documents, the agency head concerned should request for write-off and/or 

adjustment of account balances from the COA, supported by list of available 

records and extent of validation made on the accounts; and certification and 

reasons why the books of accounts/records, financial statements/schedules and 

supporting vouchers/documents cannot be located. 

 

Further analysis of SL accounts showed 338 suppliers/creditors with a total 

balance of ₱16,630,946.80 falling under the classification of dormant accounts. We 

noted that 273 of these account balances totaling ₱13,619,199.47 were carried over 

during the system migration to eNGAS in January 2007 while 65 accounts amounting 

to ₱3,011,747.33 had no movement for 6 to 13 years.  

 

Multiple SLs for a supplier/creditor 

  

As stated in Appendix 6 of GAM, Volume II, the SL shows detail for each 

control account in the GL which is maintained per account and fund cluster by the 

Accounting Division/Unit. 

 

Verification of accounting records revealed the existence of two or more SLs 

maintained for a single supplier/creditor where different SL/subsidiary codes were 

created for every transaction made with one creditor, to wit:

As shown from the table, there were instances where the set-up of payable 

and its corresponding payment were booked in different SLs resulting in an 

outstanding account on one SL and a negative balance on the other. This condition 

may also lead to difficulty in monitoring the status of A/Ps. 

 

Double booking on the set-up of payables 

 

Analysis of transactions also revealed an overstatement of ₱31,498.75 on the 

balances of three SLs resulting from double booking in the set-up of payables, to wit:

Unsubmitted supporting documents for CY 2020 payables 

 

Section 39 of PD No. 1445 provides that the Commission shall have the 

power, for purposes of inspection, to require the submission of the original of any 

order, deed, contract, or other document under which any collection of, or payment 

from, government funds may be made, together with any certificate, receipt, or other 

evidence in connection therewith. 

 

The supporting documents for payables set up in CY 2020 with outstanding 

balances aggregating to ₱511,290,971.25 at year-end were not submitted to COA, 

casting doubts on their validity, which accounted for 61 percent of the account 

balance. 

 

In the analysis of JEVs setting up A/Ps particularly those booked at the end 

of the year, the Audit Team requested the submission of supporting documents cited 

in the JEVs to validate the transactions, however, the Accounting Division failed to 

submit the documents within a reasonable period for the Team to verify or validate 

the same. The documents were only submitted on June 22, 2021, four months after 

closing of the Department’s books, thus, time constraints prevented the Team from 

conducting a comprehensive review and verification of the submitted documents to 

ascertain validity of the subject A/Ps. 

 

The foregoing lapses and deficiencies greatly affected the reliability of the 

account balance and the fairness of its presentation in the financial statements at year-

end. 

 

We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations and Management 

agreed to require the Chief Accountant to: 

 

a. review, analyze and revert all recorded payables that remained outstanding 
for two or more years pursuant to EO No. 87; 

 

b. review the SL accounts “Others” and “Various Creditors”, work back on 
prior years’ accounts and exhaust all remedies to trace/gather documents of 

the recorded amounts to identify if these are valid obligations; 

 

c. reconcile the balance of accounts payable per books against the balances 
confirmed by the creditors; 

 

d. conduct a comprehensive analysis of dormant SL accounts and request for 
write-off, where applicable, in accordance with the procedures and 

requirements of COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 5, 1997; 

 

e. effect necessary adjustments for erroneous entries; and 
 



83 
 

f. reconcile accounts with multiple SLs and maintain only one SL for each 
creditor to present reliable SL account balances. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to instruct the 

Accountant to ensure, henceforth, that all supporting documents of JEVs setting 

up A/Ps are submitted to the Audit Team monthly or upon submission of the 

quarterly and year-end trial balance and financial statements to facilitate the 

review thereof. 

 

 

Unreliable balance of account Due to Pag-IBIG 

 

14. The balance of account Due to Pag-IBIG is unreliable due to the existence of 
unidentified SL accounts with a total negative balance of ₱406,556.93. 

 

As of December 31, 2020, the balance of account Due to Pag-IBIG amounted 

to ₱1,479,284.89 consisting of ₱1,348,034.26 and ₱131,250.63 for the RAF and the 

PRF, respectively. 

 

Examination of SL showed accounts with no details and recorded in the books 

as “Others” and “Unclassified” amounting to ₱115,063.01 and ₱291,493.92, 

respectively, or a total net negative balance of ₱406,556.93, to wit:

  Total (115,063.01) (291,493.92)  (406,556.93) 

 

The existence of unidentified SL accounts renders the ending balance of the 

account Due to Pag-IBIG unreliable, more so that the accounts have abnormal 

balances. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant 

to exert more effort in the analysis, reconciliation and verification of records or 

supporting documents of unidentified/unclassified SL accounts and those with 

prolonged abnormal balances and effect the necessary adjustments.

B. Compliance Audit 
 

Deficient supporting documents and certifications on DVs 

 

15. Deficient supporting documents and certifications on DVs casted doubts on the 
validity and propriety of End-of-Service Benefits (ESB) transactions processed 

in CY 2018 totaling ₱165,912,177.60, contrary to Section 4(6-8) of PD No. 1445, 

COA Circular 2012-001 and Section 36, Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM. 

 

The ESBs received by DFA are considered Custodial or Trust Funds of the 

government; thus, disbursements or the release of benefits to claimants/beneficiaries 

are subject to auditing rules and regulations. 

 

Section 4(6-8) of PD No. 1445 requires that claims against government funds 

shall be supported with complete documentation; all laws and regulations applicable 

to financial transactions shall be faithfully adhered to; and generally accepted 

principles and practices of accounting as well as of sound management and fiscal 

administration shall be observed, provided that they do not contravene existing laws 

and regulations. 

 

The above regulations were reiterated under COA Circular No. 2012-001 

dated June 14, 2012, which also stated that sufficient and relevant documents to 

establish validity of claims is required for all types of disbursements. 

 

Section 36, Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM also provides the basic 

requirements for disbursements and the required certifications.  Under sub-section 

(d), the Head of the Accounting Unit is required to certify the availability of cash and 

completeness of the supporting documents in the DV; while sub-section (f) requires 

submission of proper evidence to establish validity of the claim, and that all payments 

of government obligations and payables shall be covered by DVs together with 

original copy of the supporting documents which will serve as basis in the evaluation 

of authenticity and authority of the claim. 

 

Our audit of DVs processed in CY 2018 on the release of ESB to beneficiaries 

totaling ₱165,912,177.60 disclosed that the transactions were not supported with 

complete documents to establish validity of the claims, such as death certificates in 

cases where the OFWs died and the claimants are the next of kin (NOK), marriage 

and/or birth certificates of OFWs and NOK, and certifications from the POEA and 

OWWA. In addition, the signatory in part C of the DV only certified as to availability 

of cash and did not certify as to the completeness of supporting documents. 

 

Per inquiry, the responsible officer of OUMWA informed the Audit Team 

that the death, birth and marriage certificates are on their files as they consider the 

documents confidential; thus, they are only listed as among the supporting documents 

on the face of the DVs.  The required documents are, however, necessary in validating 



85 
 

the authenticity of the claims, more so that nobody certified as to the completeness 

of supporting documents in the DV. 

 

We also noted that no monitoring mechanism or control is in place to confirm 

whether the ESB were received by the rightful claimants.  The amount of released 

ESB were reflected in the bank statements provided by PNB, however, the bank 

account number where the amount was credited or the person to whom the manager’s 

check was issued could not be verified in the bank statements. 

 

The foregoing deficiencies casted doubts on the propriety and validity of the 

disbursements. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the responsible 

officers of OUMWA to: 

 

a. submit to the Audit Team copies of death, marriage, birth certificates, and 
OWWA/POEA certifications, and to prospectively attach these supporting 

documents to the DVs forwarded for audit, to establish validity of 

transactions; 

 

b. ensure that all DVs on the release of ESB are certified as to the completeness 
of supporting documents; and 

 

c. devise a monitoring or control measure or coordinate with PNB to confirm 
or ascertain the receipt of the ESB by the rightful beneficiary. 

 

 

Inadequate internal control system 

 

16. Segregation of duties and responsibilities was not observed in the processing of 
ESB transactions, reflecting inadequate internal control system in the 

management of ESB trust funds. 

 

One of the elements of a sound internal control system within an organization 

is the segregation of duties and functions/responsibilities to ensure check and balance. 

 

Section 50, Volume III of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual 

(GAAM), provides that key duties and functions such as authorization, custody and 

accounting shall be assigned to separate offices and individuals to eliminate 

opportunities to conceal errors and irregularities. It further states that no one person 

or department should be in complete control over a transaction to ensure existence of 

effective check and balance. 

 

 



86 
 

Audit of disbursements for ESB disclosed that the processing, approval and 

release of benefits are all discharged by OUMWA, with the following signatories on 

the DVs: 

 
Box/Part Signatory Action 

A Assistance to Nationals 

(ATN) Officer or Director 

Certified that disbursement is necessary, lawful 

and incurred under his/her direct supervision 

C ESB Accounts Officer Certified that cash is available  

D Undersecretary  Approved for payment 

 

In relation to paragraph 12, the certification in box C is not in accordance with 

Section 36, Chapter 2, Volume I of the GAM, where said part should not only certify 

as to the availability of cash but also certify as to the completeness of supporting 

documents; and that it should be certified by the Chief Accountant or authorized 

representative. Moreover, the transactions are not being reviewed by the Financial 

Resources Management Division (FRMD) under the OFMS.  The only role of the 

OFMS is recording ESB transactions in the books by its Accounting Division. 

 

After the processing and approval of the DVs, releases of ESB to beneficiaries 

are done through the issuance of a letter, signed by the OUMWA Undersecretary, to 

the PNB with the instructions to transfer from the OUMWA PNB Account the 

amount of ESB to the designated bank account of the beneficiary or, in some 

instances, issue a manager’s check to the latter. 

 

The Audit Team noted that no BURS is being prepared for all disbursements 

of ESB, contrary to Section 19, Chapter 3, Volume I of the GAM, which requires the 

issuance of the BURS in the incurrence of budget utilization. The BURS shall be 

prepared by the Requesting/Originating Office supported by valid claim documents.  

Section C of the BURS serves as the subsidiary record to monitor utilization. 

 

Various provisions of the GAM clearly indicate separation of duties for check 

and balance. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the concerned 

OUMWA officials to transfer the financial functions and responsibilities to the 

OFMS, particularly the complete certification on box C of the DV by the 

Accountant; and to prepare BURS for all disbursements in accordance with the 

provisions of the GAM. 

 

 

Absence of prescriptive guidelines 

 

17. Absence of prescriptive guidelines caused delays, from one to seven years, in the 
release of ESB totaling ₱66,530,688.40 to the beneficiaries, and funds of 

₱209,201,028.75 remained idle from 1 to 11 years in custodianship as of 

December 31, 2018. 

 



87 
 

As discussed in paragraphs 4 and 5, OUMWA is tasked with the management 

of ESB remitted by the FSPs who received the same from the employers of the OFWs 

for distribution to the latter or their beneficiaries. 

 

In the CY 2016 audit of ESB, our recommendation contained in the AAR was 

for Management to finalize the proposed guidelines in the processing of benefit 

claims to facilitate the prompt release of the ESB, and to include in the proposed 

guidelines the reasonable prescriptive period for filing the benefit claim and consider 

forfeiture of benefits in favor of the government in case of failure by the 

beneficiary/claimant to do so, with this information indicated in the notice sent to the 

beneficiary. 

 

The Audit Team requested for a copy of the latest circular concerning ESB 

transactions but were informed that there are no official guidelines yet related to ESB, 

except for FSC No. 109-02 dated June 24, 2002, which showed, after evaluation, that 

some of its provisions are no longer practiced and does not provide a specific or 

definite guideline or procedure for the release of ESB to beneficiaries. 

 

Lack of prescriptive guidelines in the handling of ESB resulted in the delayed 

release of benefits, which have been under the custody of the Department for one to 

seven years as of December 31, 2018.  Review of transactions for CY 2018 disclosed 

that remittance received from the FSPs in prior years totaling ₱66,530,688.40 were 

only processed and released in 2018, as detailed below: 

 

Year of Receipt Released in 2018 

2017 61,791,215.51 

2016 2,370,237.57

2012 -

Total 66,530,688.40 

 

Based on the verified Status of Funds provided by OUMWA, 13.10 percent 

of the outstanding balances of benefits per year of remittance were unreleased for one 

to eleven years, as shown below:

Interview conducted with OUMWA personnel disclosed that delays in the 

release of ESB to OFWs/beneficiaries were attributed to the following: 

 

a. Untraceable whereabouts of the recipients; 
b. Incomplete documentation requirements; 
c. Use of substitute name of the OFWs; 
d. Illegal or undocumented workers; 
e. Discrepancy between records; 
f. Multiple marriages and illegitimate children; and 
g. Family disputes. 

 

Delay in the release of benefits deprived the OFWs/beneficiaries of the much-

needed financial assistance. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to revisit and evaluate the 

relevance of FSC No. 109-02 dated June 24, 2002 in relation to current practice, 

and prepare definitive and prescriptive guidelines and procedures in the 

handling of ESB especially in the processing of benefit claims to facilitate the 

immediate release to the beneficiaries. 

 

 

Unremitted interest income from bank account  

 

18. Interest earned from various bank accounts maintained under PRF and Trust 
Fund at the Home Office totaling ₱2,803,254.15 were not remitted to the 

National Treasury as of December 31, 2020, contrary to Section 65 of PD No. 

1445 depriving the government of additional funds to finance its 

programs/projects.   

 

Section 65(1) of PD No. 1445 provide that unless otherwise specifically 

provided by law, all income accruing to the agencies by virtue of the provisions of 

law, orders and regulations shall be deposited in the National Treasury or in any duly 

authorized government depository, and shall accrue to the unappropriated surplus of 

the General Fund of the Government.  This was also reiterated in Section 4(a), 

Chapter 2 and Section 3, Chapter 5 of GAM, Volume I.

Further verification revealed that only the interest income from the three LBP

The non-remittance of the interest income to the National Treasury 

contravened the above-stated regulations and deprived the government of additional 

funds to finance its programs/projects. 

 

This deficiency has been raised in our previous audit reports, but the same has 

not been fully implemented. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief 

Accountant to remit immediately to the National Treasury all interest income 

earned from bank accounts pursuant to existing laws and regulations. 

 

 

C. Other Areas

19. The five percent allocation for GAD Fund was not fully complied with as 
prescribed by the PCW/NEDA/DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-01 and as required 

under Section 31 of the General Provisions of the FY 2020 GAA.  Also, the 

agency failed to submit duly approved GPB and AR to the Audit Team pursuant 

to COA Circular 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014. 

 

Section 31 of the General Provisions of GAA and Policy Guidelines 2.3 of 

the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-001provides that the GAD Plan shall 

be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five 

percent of their budgets.  

 

Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 prescribes the responsibility of the 

audited agency to submit a copy of the Annual GPB to the COA Audit Team assigned 

to the agency within five working days from the receipt of the approved plan from 

the PCW.  Likewise, a copy of the corresponding Accomplishment Report shall be 

furnished the said Audit Team within five working days from the end of January of 

the preceding year. 

 

Based on the submitted Plan/Program, Budget, Fund Utilization and 

Accomplishments of the DFA for CY 2020, the reported GAD budget allotted for the 

year was ₱712,472,895.00.  The amount allocated was not within the required 5 

percent of the total agency’s budget appropriations of ₱24,047,378,000.00.   

 

The agency’s failure to fully comply with the provisions of the GAA deprives 

the supposed beneficiaries of the government on GAD programs of the benefits due 

them. 

 

Moreover, the agency did not submit to the Audit Team their approved GPB 

and the AR for CY 2020. In effect, the Audit Team was not able to evaluate the 

accomplished activities viz a viz the proposed activities and the budgeted costs. 



91 
 

 

It was gathered that the 2020 AR was submitted to PCW on March 12, 2021 

and is still under review by the said agency. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. comply with the provisions of the GAA and Joint Circular 2012-001 
regarding GAD fund allocation; and 

 

b. instruct concerned officials to submit to the COA Audit Team the Annual 
GPB and corresponding AR within the period prescribed under COA 

Circular No. 2014-001 for audit and evaluation thereof. 

 

Senior Citizens and Differently-Abled 

 

20. The DFA did not submit to the Audit Team plans, targets and accomplishments 
related to senior citizens and persons with disability for the year 2020 contrary to 

Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020.   

 

However, the agency enumerated 18 undated webinar/online meetings relative to 

PPAs on persons with disability, said to have been participated/attended by one up to 

16 personnel from Home Office, FSPs and Consular Offices.  Some of the webinars 

mentioned were the National Autism Consciousness Week, Webinar on Parenting 

Children with Neurodevelopmental Disabilities, Deaf Awareness Week, Online 

Learning Session on Enterprise Development for Deaf Persons, Webinar on Tertiary 

Education Subsidy for PWDs, and “KaSaMaPa Webinar Program” for the 

International Day of PWDs. 

 

Management informed the Audit Team that plans/programs which are specific to 

Senior Citizens were not implemented in 2020 due to constraints brought about by 

the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

Notwithstanding the above deficiencies, DFA provided courtesy lane for senior 

citizens and PWD applying for passports and PWD-friendly facilities were also in 

place in its premises. 

 

 

Tax Laws 

 

21. For CY 2020, DFA withheld taxes totaling ₱431,930,756.11 from personnel and 
suppliers, and remitted the amount of ₱385,433,953.24 leaving a balance of 

₱46,496,802.87 as of December 31, 2020.

GSIS Premium Deductions and Remittances 

 

22. Amounts withheld from employees’ salaries representing employees 
contributions, insurance premiums and loan repayments and the government 

shares were not remitted in full to the GSIS as they fall due, contrary to the 

provision of RA No. 8291, which had accumulated to ₱28,497,360.99 due to the 

failure to monitor remittances of outstanding balances. 

 

Section 6 (b) of RA No. 8291 (GSIS Act of 1997) states that each employer 

shall remit directly to the GSIS the employees’ and the employers’ contributions 

within the first ten (10) days of the calendar month following the month to which the 

contributions apply. The remittance by the employer of the contributions to the GSIS 

shall take priority over and above the payment of any and all obligations, except 

salaries and wages of its employees. 

 

In addition, Section 5(c) of the above law states among others penal sanctions 

shall be imposed upon employers who fail to include the payment of contributions in 

their annual appropriations or otherwise fail to remit the accurate/exact amount of 

contributions on time, or delay the remittance of premium contributions to the GSIS. 

The heads of offices and agencies shall be administratively liable for non-remittance 

or delayed remittance of premium contributions to the GSIS. 

 

As of December 31, 2020, the balance of account Due to GSIS amounted to 

₱28,497,360.99, consisting of ₱25,449,278.74 and ₱3,048,082.25 for the RAF and 

the PRF, respectively, detailed as follows:

disclosed, however, that ₱25,331,516.24 or 89.89 percent of the balance comprised 

unremitted amounts for the period January to November 2020 totaling 

₱12,595,240.94 and Prior Years of ₱12,736,275.30, to wit:

As reported in our CY 2019 AAR, the unremitted balances that have 

accumulated over the years were attributed to the discrepancies between the total 

amount deducted from the payroll and the corresponding remittances, and deductions 

made from individual claims of employees for initial salaries and salary differentials 

which were not included in the amounts remitted to GSIS. These conditions remained 

uncorrected and were still prevalent in CY 2020. 

 

The delayed or non-remittance of contributions to GSIS could deprive DFA 

employees from availing full entitlement, benefits and rights cited in RA No. 8291 

such as separation benefits, retirement benefits, and other benefits as well as renewal 

of loans that members may avail of, if they have outstanding accounts with the GSIS 

as a result of delayed or non-remittance of monies due to GSIS. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant 

to: 

 

a. remit immediately the outstanding balances including those of prior years;  
 

b. remit in full all GSIS contributions or payments withheld from the accounts 
of employees and its counterpart Government share on or before the set due 

dates; and 

 

c. strictly monitor remittances of withheld amounts to prevent accumulation 
and the incurrence of the corresponding penalties.

Pag-IBIG Fund Contributions 

 

23. The year-end balance of the account Due to Pag-IBIG of ₱1,479,284.89 did not 
represent the amounts withheld in December 2020 for remittance on the 

following month, but the accumulation of unremitted amounts through the years 

due to failure to remit in full all withheld amounts including the government 

share contrary to the provisions of RA No. 9679. 

 

Section 7 of RA No. 9679 (Home Development Mutual Fund Law of 2009) 

states that the money of the Fund shall be generated by the provident savings that the 

covered employees shall contribute for the purpose every month, and the equal 

amounts that their respective employers shall mandatorily contribute. Xxx. 

Notwithstanding any contract to the contrary, an employer shall not deduct, directly 

or indirectly, from the compensation of its employees covered by the Fund, or 

otherwise recover from them, the employer’s contribution with respect to such 

employees. 

 

Furthermore, Section 25 of  RA No. 9679 states that the refusal or failure 

without lawful cause or with fraudulent intent to comply with the provisions of this 

Act, particularly with respect to registration of employees, collection and remittance 

of employee-savings as well as the employer counterparts, or the correct amount due, 

within the time set in the implementing rules and regulations or specific call or 

extension made by the Fund management shall constitute an offense punishable by a 

fine and/or imprisonment. 

 

As of December 31, 2020, the balance of account Due to Pag-IBIG amounted 

to ₱1,479,284.89 consisting of ₱1,348,034.26 and ₱131,250.63 for the RAF and the 

PRF, respectively, detailed as follows:

As shown from the above table, the bulk of the amount due for remittance 

pertains to PY accounts totaling ₱1,333,667.80 or 97.89 percent, indicating 

inadequate efforts in addressing the deficiency on long outstanding accounts reported 

in the CY 2019 AAR, with only 19.12 percent or ₱315,213.13 remitted and/or 

adjusted during the year covering PYs 2016, 2018 and 2019. 

 

We noted that the accumulation of unremitted balances was attributed to the 

discrepancies between the total amounts withheld from payrolls and individual 

claims and the amounts remitted which had accumulated from prior years and 

remained outstanding in CY 2020. 

 

The delayed or non-remittance of contributions to HDMF could deprive DFA 

employees from enjoying/availing benefits such as housing and short-term loans, and 

provident savings where money would grow higher than other investment facilities. 

 

Examination of SL also showed accounts with no details and recorded in the 

books as “Others” and “Unclassified” amounting to ₱115,063.01 and ₱291,493.92, 

respectively, or a total net negative balance of ₱406,556.93, as shown below:

96 
 

The existence of unidentified SL accounts renders the ending balance of the 

account Due to Pag-IBIG unreliable, more so that the accounts have abnormal 

balances. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant 

to:  

 

a. remit immediately the outstanding balances including those of prior years; 
 

b. henceforth, remit in full all Pag-IBIG contributions/payments withheld from 
the accounts of employees and its counterpart Government share on or 

before the set due dates; 

c. exert more effort in the analysis, reconciliation and verification of records or 
supporting documents of unidentified/unclassified SL accounts and those 

with prolonged abnormal balances and effect the necessary adjustments; and 

 

d. record simultaneously from beginning/initial set-up, the Employee and 
Government Share, for easement of the matching principle. 

 

 

PhilHealth Contributions 

 

24. Employees’ contributions withheld from their salaries were not remitted in full 
to PhilHealth, contrary to Section 18(b) of the Revised IRR of RA No. 7875 as 

amended by RA Nos. 9241 and 10606, resulting in the accumulation of 

unremitted employees’ contributions of ₱2,791,954.49. Likewise, an equally 

shared premium for CY 2020 and prior years representing government share 

totaling ₱1,468,402.54 were not recognized nor remitted contrary to the same 

law. 

 

Section 11 of RA No. 7875 as amended by RA Nos. 9241 and 10606 “The 

National Health Insurance Act of 2013” provides that remittance of contribution shall 

be mandatory for all members. It shall be made to PhilHealth offices or to any of the 

accredited collecting agents. Failure to timely remit the appropriate premium 

contribution shall be subject to interest and penalties as prescribed by the Corporation 

xxx. 

 

Further, Section 18, (a) requires that member’s monthly contribution shall be 

deducted and withheld automatically by the employer from the former’s salary, wage 

or earnings. The premium contributed shall be divided equally between the employer 

and the employed. The employer’s counterpart shall not, in any manner be charged 

to the employee. (b) The monthly premium contributions of employed members shall 

be remitted by the employer on or before the tenth (10th) calendar day of the month 

following the applicable month for which the payment is due and applicable. 

 



97 
 

Furthermore, Section 179states that any employer or officer authorized to 

collect contributions who, after collecting or deducting the monthly contributions due 

from the employees, fails or refuse to remit said contributions to the Corporation 

within thirty (30) days from the date they become due shall be punished with a fine 

of not less than Five Thousand Pesos (₱5,000.00) but not more than Ten Thousand 

Pesos (₱10,000.00) multiplied by the total number of employees of the firm. 

 

During the year, the balance of the account Due to PhilHealth amounted to 

₱2,791,954.49 consisting of ₱1,993,509.76 and ₱798,444.73 for the RAF and the

As reported in our CY 2019 AAR, the unremitted balances that have 

accumulated over the years were attributed to the discrepancies between the total 

amounts deducted from the payroll and the corresponding remittances, and 

deductions made from individual claims of employees for initial salaries and salary 

differentials which were not included in the amounts remitted to PhilHealth. These 

conditions remained uncorrected and were still prevalent in CY 2020. 

 

We also noted that the set up payable and remittances did not include the 

counterpart government shares for those employees’ contributions deducted from 

individual claims, contrary to the above-stated provision that premium contribution 

shall be divided equally between the employer and the employed. A total variance of 

₱1,468,402.54was determined in the contribution shared by Government and 

Employee for CYs 2015 to 2020. This variance had been reported in our previous 

year’s AAR, however, the same still existed and even increased during the year by 

65 percent from last year’s total variance of ₱889,325.41 with only a minimal 

remittance of ₱1,650.00 for CY 2019. Details are as follows:

The delayed or non-remittance of contributions to PhilHealth, and the non-

reconciliation of the accounts of employees with the share required from 

government/employer could deprive DFA employees from availing full entitlement, 

benefits and rights to the program cited in RA No. 7875 as amended by RA Nos. 

9241 and 10606, such as in-patient care, out-patient medical and surgical care, 

emergency and transfer services, health education packages, and other health care 

services.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant 

to: 

 

a. remit immediately the overdue contributions to the PhilHealth and 
henceforth ensure the timely remittance of all monies due to PhilHealth; 

 

b. reconcile the variance on the equally shared premium contributions of 
Government and Employees and remit the same to PhilHealth; and 

 

c. strictly monitor remittances of withheld amounts to prevent accumulation 
and the incurrence of the corresponding penalties.

Fund Utilization 

 

27. Utilization of cash allocations received during the year totaling 
₱21,056,090,722.00 was not maximized resulting in the reversion of a substantial 

amount of lapsed NCA of ₱8,293,835,376.17 or 39.39 percent. 

 

Section 1 of DBM Circular Letter (CL) No. 2019-13 dated October 31, 2019 

provides that:  To facilitate the prompt implementation of government programs and 

projects by the timely release of funds and the conduct of early procurement 

activities, departments/agencies/operating units (OUs) are annually required to 

submit their respective Budget Execution Documents (BEDs) to serve as bases for 

the formulation of the national government's budget release schedule including the 

monthly disbursement program. 

 

DBM CL No. 2016-9 dated October 27, 2016 was issued to guide government 

agencies in the preparation and submission of their annual budget execution plans.  

It provides among others that, government agencies shall execute their programs and 

projects as authorized in the annual budget and deliver planned results in a timely 

manner.  It also requires agencies to regularly prepare the BEDs which contain the 

agency plans, spending schedules and physical targets to be submitted to the DBM 

for evaluation and consolidation. The BEDs serve as bases to facilitate the release of 



100 
 

funds and enable prompt implementation of programs, PPA including the conduct of 

early procurement activities. 

 

For CY 2020, DFA received a total cash allocation of ₱21,056,090,722.00 to 

finance the implementation of its PPA. Review of NCA releases revealed a low 

utilization rate of 60.61 percent or a total of ₱12,762,255,345.83 that resulted in the 

reversion of unused NCA totaling ₱8,293,835,376.17 or39.39percent to the National 

Treasury, to wit:

Presented below is the summary and the reasons provided by Management 

for the reversion of the lapsed NCAs: 

 

Particulars Amount (₱) 

Building Fund 802,000,937.19 

e-Passport Project 3,686,534,839.00 

Other Regular Operating Expenses 3,805,299,599.98 

Total 8,293,835,376.17 

 

Building Fund 
 

• Commencement of the Chancery/Residence projects has been delayed because 
of reciprocity issues with the host government and the need to comply with the 

local laws governing the purchase of foreign mission properties in their 

respective host countries, prior to the scheduled acquisition of new properties. 
 

• There have been failures in bidding at various Posts: e.g. no interested bidders, 
no visitor hits for the posted Notice of Bidding, and difficulty of interested 

bidders to meet the specifications. 
 

• The cash requirement for the Building Fund were not remitted to income 
generating posts like the Philippine Embassies in Singapore and Rome since 

these posts have sufficient cash to cover the building fund. 
 

• Funds used in place of the Building Fund were sourced from other current 
operating expenses to optimize the use of available NCAs and minimize the 

amount to be reverted to the Bureau of Treasury. 

 

 

 



101 
 

e-Passport Project 
 

• There were delays in the receipt of billings for the printing of passport booklets. 

• Billings were received after the lapse of the related NCA for a given quarter. 
 

Other Regular Operating Expenses  
 

• Implementations of new and ongoing projects take longer than one year, 
including payment. 

• Billings from prior year’s procurement are only received in the following year. 

• Cancellation of some projects beyond the control of the Department. 
 

We noted that the foregoing factors were also given by Management as 

reasons for the unutilized NCAs in previous years, thus, they could have considered 

these factors in the preparation of their 2020 MDP to avoid overestimates. 

 

Management’s failure to maximize the use of available cash allocations 

indicated inadequate planning and inefficient fund management which could be 

attributed to unrealistic estimates of cash requirements, slow processing of claims, 

and/or failure to implement the PPA that were considered in the preparation of MDP. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. instruct the concerned officials of the Office of Financial Management 
Services to strengthen the Department’s cash programming and 

management system through preparation of realistic disbursement program 

and accelerate the processing of claims to prevent the lapsing and reversion 

of huge amount of unused cash allocations; and 

 

b. review or revisit its target setting system including procurement practices to 
come up with a more practical budget; and closely monitor the 

implementation of PPA that were considered in the MDP to optimize 

utilization of NCAs. 

 

Management commented that the low utilization rate can be attributed to the 

unfavourable circumstances brought about by COVID-19 pandemic, which 

considerably affected the Department’s operations and procurement activities. 

 

In addition, Management committed to undertake the following measures to 

address the low utilization rate of cash allocations: 

 

a. OFMS will continue to closely monitor cash programming and processing of 
claims/disbursements to reduce, if not prevent, reversion of unused cash 

allocation; 

 



102 
 

b. DFA Management will convey to the different operating units in the Department 
to closely monitor their procurement program and review/revisit these 

accordingly to optimize utilization of budget and cash allocation; 

 

c. Concerned offices of the Department shall be reminded to coordinate closely with 
BAC on their procurement activities in compliance with R.A. No. 9184 with the 

end goal of timely procurement and settlement in accordance with the cash 

program; and  

 

d. BAC will be tasked to provide more frequent seminars/workshops on 
procurement rules, regulations, procedures and updates/refreshers thereon to 

address the issue of information lapses due to the frequent rotation of personnel. 

 

Auditor’s Rejoinder:  

 

The Audit Team will monitor the implementation of the committed courses 

of action. 

 

 

COVID Funds 

 

28. Pursuant to Section 4(y) of RA No. 11469, known as the Bayanihan to Heal as One 
Act, the DFA remitted to the National Treasury the amount of ₱113,015,560.46 from 

the PRF to respond to the national emergency brought about by the COVID-19 

pandemic. 

 

On the other hand, the amount of ₱5,094,700.00 was received from the Contingent 

Fund under SARO-BMB-D-20-0003991 dated March 24, 2020 to cover Philippine 

donation to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies 

(IFRC) in response to COVID-19. The fund was transferred to the PCG New York 

for remittance to the IFRC.

during the CY 2020. 

 

 

REGIONAL CONSULAR OFFICES (RCOs) 

 

The transactions and operations of RCOs were audited by the Regional Audit 

Teams assigned thereat. Results of audit were conveyed to Management through issuance 

of AOM.  Accordingly, exit conferences were held to discuss the audit highlights and to 

solicit Management’s comments for incorporation in the Summary of Audit Observations 

and Recommendations (SAOR) submitted to the Office of the Auditor, DFA-Home Office.  

The significant observations and recommendations are discussed briefly as follows: 

 

30. Collections in RCO Zamboanga were not deposited regularly contrary to 
Section 69 (a) of PD No. 1445; Section 39 (a), Chapter 5, Volume I of the GAM 

for the NGAs; and COA-MOF Joint Circular No. 1-81, thus, exposed 

government funds to possible misuse and loss. 

 

We recommended that Management adopt a plan to ensure that the 

Accountable Officer deposits her collections in accordance with the above-

mentioned provisions. 

 

31. AOs at RCO Legaspi, Butuan, and San Pablo City were not bonded, while the 
bonds of AOs at RCO Tacloban and Zamboanga have expired and were not 

renewed immediately contrary to Section 101 of PD No. 1445 and Treasury 

Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009, thus, exposing government interest 

to various risks. 

 

We recommended that Management direct the concerned Officer-in-

Charge of said RCOs to ensure that all AOs are properly bonded and/or bonds 

are renewed regularly, as required by law. 

 

32. The Lipa Consular Office incurred delay in the submission of bank 
reconciliation statements (BRS) ranging from 48 to 126 days for CY 2020 

contrary to the provisions of Sections 4 and 5 of the GAM thus, affecting timely 

verification of the reports/statements, and correction of deficiencies, if any. 

 

 

 



104 
 

We recommended that the Regional Officer require the Accountant to: 

 

a. make representation with the bank officials to have an access to online 
banking account for the real time bank statement and balances; and  

 

b. prepare and submit the BRS within the prescribed period stated in Section 3 
Chapter 21 of the GAM, Volume I to enable the Audit Team to render 

analysis and verification of the cash account. 

 

33. Unserviceable properties at RCO Butuan, Cebu, Legaspi, Lucena, Puerto 
Princesa and Tuguegarao with an aggregate cost of ₱1,494,939.00 were not 

disposed of, contrary to Section 79 of PD No. 1445, thus, occupying space in the 

office premises and exposing the assets to further deterioration and gradually 

losing their economic value. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the concerned 

Property Officers to: 

 

a.  prepare the Inventory and Inspection of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) 
and request for authority from the DFA-Home Office to dispose the subject 

unserviceable properties; 

 

b. disposed immediately the unserviceable properties to prevent further 
deterioration, make available space and storage for the Consular Office and 

generate income from the sale; and 

 

c. submit to the DFA-Home Office the IRRUP and other necessary documents 
needed for the dropping in the books of accounts. 

 

34. RCO Angeles City and San Fernando City, Pampanga failed to conduct actual 
physical count of its PPE, Inventories and Semi-expendable items totaling 

₱2,703,869.80 and ₱1,950,890.73 respectively, during the year under audit 

contrary to pertinent provisions of Chapter 10 of GAM Volume I, thus affecting 

the reliability of the reported PPE and inventory balances at year-end. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to prioritize the conduct of a 

complete physical inventory of all the PPE and inventory accounts of the Agency 

to determine their existence, condition, functionality and integrity of the 

recorded PPE in the financial statements, taking into consideration the 

prescribed health protocols. 

 

35. Perfected contracts on purchases of various supplies and materials and contract 
of services with a total amount of ₱195,880.53 at RCO Tacloban City were not 

submitted to the Auditor within five working days upon its issuance while POs 

valued at ₱133, 772.66   issued during the year in RCO Lipa City were not 



105 
 

submitted to COA contrary to COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 

2009, thereby precluding the audit teams to conduct timely review thereof. 

 

We recommend that, henceforth Management require the 

Property/Supplier Officer to submit copies of perfected contracts and POs and 

its supporting documents to the Office of the Auditor, within five (5) working 

days from its issuance, as required in Section 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-

001 dated February 12, 2009 for a timely review of the same. 

 

36. Due to the lack of details on unit cost/value of the 38 assets listed as PPE in the 
RPCPPE in RCO Butuan, the capitalization threshold of the individual asset 

cannot be readily determined as one of the criteria for recognition of PPE under 

Section 3, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs. Likewise, it casts doubt on its 

proper classification, which may affect the reliability of PPE reported to the 

DFA-Main Office, tasked to record the DFA Consular Office transactions. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. request a copy of the JEV and Property Transfer Reports (PTR) from DFA 
Main-Office supporting the assets transferred to CO Butuan in prior years; 

and 

 

b. direct the Finance Officer and Property Officer to review the financial 
reports of CO Butuan for those assets reported in the RPCPPE with no 

available data. 

 

37. The  Consular Office of Antipolo City was not able to prepare and submit 
Property Inventory Form (PIF) listing of its insurable PPE for CY 2020 as basis 

for assessment for general insurance coverage to the General Insurance Fund of 

the GSIS despite of the appropriation/allotment for Insurance Expense in 

violation to COA Circular No. 2018-002 dated May 31, 2018 and RA No. 656, 

thus, denies the government adequate and reliable protection against any 

damage to or loss of its properties or assets due to fire, earthquake, storm or 

other fortuitous events/casualty. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to immediately instruct the 

concerned personnel to facilitate the preparation and submission of the PIF to 

GSIS for the assessment of the necessary insurance coverage of all insurable 

properties. 

 

38. The Supply and Property Officer at RCO San Pablo City was not able to prepare 
Property Acknowledgement Report (PAR), Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS) and 

Stock and Property Cards thus, accountability over the properties cannot be 

easily determined as well as the monitoring and control of the inventories 

contrary to Section 11 & 17, Chapter 8 and Section 42, Chapter 10, respectively, 

of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 



106 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the 

Property/Supply Officer to prepare the PAR, ICS, Property Cards and Stock 

Cards for the accountability, monitoring and control of the properties and 

inventories of the Consular Office. 

 

39. Proper Internal Control was not observed because custodial, accounting, 
disbursing and collecting functions were assigned to and controlled by only one 

person, thus, showing merger of incompatible duties in RCO Cotabato.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to refrain from merging 

incompatible duties and assigned or designate regular employees to perform 

duties and functions which are incompatible in order to establish proper 

internal control and to avoid accounting fraud and misappropriation of funds. 

 

40. The separation of duties and responsibilities of personnel handling the cash 
transaction was not observed by RCO Dasmarinas, contrary to one of the 

specific standards of internal control the segregation of duties and functions, 

thus the possible commitment of errors and fraud could not be immediately 

detected. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to designate permanent 

employee other than the Finance Officer as alternate Collecting Officer. 

 

41. The utilization of the total allotments received by RCO Dasmarinas City for CYs 
2019 & 2020 totaling ₱2,416,960.00 was not fully maximized, of which only the 

amount of ₱797,950.59 was expended/disbursed, leaving unexpended balance of 

₱1,619,009.41 as of December 31, 2020 which should be returned to the DFA-

Home Office or remitted to the National Treasury as directed by Sections 99 and 

60 of PD No. 1445 and GAA for CY 2019, respectively, thus, the expected 

benefits of the Consular Office before the expiration was not achieved. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the concerned 

employees to: 

 

a. ensure maximum utilization of funds appropriated/allotted to fully achieve 
the intended benefits and avoid reversion of any unexpended balance; and 

 

b. return/remit the balance of allotment for CYs 2019 and 2020 amounting to 
₱1,619,009.41 either to the DFA-Home Office or to the National Treasury; 

to fund additional projects and programs of the government. 

 

42. Lack of proper planning and poor supervision of activities resulted in a total 
unutilized funds from year’s 2018, 2019 and 2020 amounting to ₱669,551.38, 

₱715,710.01 and ₱333,289.60, respectively, which remained in the possession of 

RCO Lipa and not returned to the National Treasury contrary to Section 1.b 

and 1.c of EO No. 91, and DBM issued Circular Letter No. 2016-9 dated October 



107 
 

27, 2016, thus, the intended basic needs and requirements of the agency was not 

fully met. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

  

a. instruct the concerned officials to strengthen the Department’s cash 
programming and management system through preparation of realistic 

disbursement program and accelerate the processing of claims to prevent the 

lapsing and reversion of huge amount of unused cash allocations;  

 

b. review or revisit its target setting system including procurement practices to 
come up with a more practical budget; and 

 

c. closely monitor the implementation of PPA that were considered in the 
Monthly Disbursement Program (MDP) to optimize utilization of NCAs. 

 

43. Department of Foreign Affairs Multipurpose Cooperative (DFAMC), catering 
copier, notarial and courier services inside Consular Offices were not charged 

of their electricity usage contrary to Section 2.1.2.7 of the Memorandum of 

Agreement (MOA) between the DFA and SM Prime Holdings & Consolidated 

Prime Dev. Corp. and Section 4(2) of PD No. 1445, thus, depleted the 

maintenance fund of the Agency. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the:  

 

a. DFAMC Officer to install sub-meter for their electricity usage; and 
 

b. Financial Analyst and the Administrative Officer to send bill and collect the 
cost of electric expenses consumed by the DFAMPC. 

 

44. DVs and their supporting documents in RCO Santiago City and Tuguegarao 
City were not stamped “PAID” upon payment, contrary to COA Circular 92-

389 dated November 3, 1992, thus making the said supporting documents 

susceptible to possible re-use for future claims. 

 

We recommended and management agreed that the Cashier s shall 

stamp “PAID” the DVs and their supporting documents after payment and 

indicate the number of the check issued and the date of actual payment to avert 

any attempt to use the same supporting documents in payment of future claims, 

thereby safeguarding government resources against loss or wastage. 

 

45. GAD issues were not fully addressed in RCO San Fernando City, Pampanga due 
to the allocation of less than 5 percent of the Agency’s Operating Budget and the 

under-utilization of the allocated amount for GAD. 

 



108 
 

We recommended and Management agreed to prepare and implement 

their GAD Plan and Budget in accordance with the provisions of Section 31 of 

GAA FY 2020. 

 

46. The reported GAD actual expenditures in the CY 2020 GAD Accomplishment 
Report with a total amount of ₱33,300.00 at RCO Tacloban is understated by 

₱54,628.49 due to the failure of the GAD Focal Point Officer to include the 

attributed cost on Personal Services, contrary to PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint 

Circular 2012-001, thus understating the recognized actual expenditures on 

GAD and minimizing the mainstreamed disbursements on agency programs, 

projects and activities. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the GAD Focal 

Point Officer to be guided with the PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular 2012-001 

in the preparation of GAD Plan and Budget and GAD Accomplishment Report 

taking into account attributions on personal services and mainstreamed 

expenditures that will show gender responsiveness of the agency’s regular 

programs and projects. 

 

47. The RCOs in San Fernando City and Angeles City, Pampanga and Malolos, 
Bulacan failed to prepare and submit plans, programs and projects intended to 

address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to formulate plans, 

programs and projects for the senior citizens and persons with disability and 

integrate the same in their regular activities in compliance with the provisions 

of Section 32 of GAA FY 2020. 

 

 

FOREIGN SERVICE POSTS (FSPs) 

 

For the year 2020, there were no COA teams deployed to audit the different FSPs 

due to the outbreak of COVID19 worldwide.  However, eight Management Letters on the 

audit of the following FSPs conducted in 2019 were transmitted after the 2019 AAR report 

date and were included in this report, to wit:

Audit areas looked into included among others, the following:  a) cash and property 

management, b) internal control system, c) performance audit on selected areas of 

operations and financial reporting system.  Results of audit disclosed no significant 

discrepancies between the cash and property accountabilities of the AOs of FSPs as 

established and the results of cash count, property inspection and review of bank 

reconciliation statements.  However, certain deficiencies were noted as discussed in the 

succeeding paragraphs:  

 

 

CASH MANAGEMENT 

 

Existence of dormant funds 

 

48. Funds for the Treaty on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Program in the 
amount of PhP5 million or equivalent to $105,178.18 remained unutilized for 

more than 10 years and unreturned to the DFA-Home Office despite several 

written requests by the Post for disposition of such funds, that thereby, the Post 

incurred a bank charge for dormancy totaling $91.69, and deprived the 

government the utilization of the funds for other priority projects. (PE Madrid) 

 

We recommended and the Post agreed: 

a. To request the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, to refer the matter to the 
Permanent Committee (PC) created pursuant to Section 45, Chapter 5, Book 

VI of the Administration Code of 1987 (EO No. 292); and 

 

b. To provide the PC with the information pertinent to these funds held in 
dormant account for the committee to (i) evaluate, examine, review these 

funds and determine whether there is still a need to maintain the fund 

considering that no sentenced Philippine nationals are interested to avail of 

the program; and (ii) recommend to the President of the Philippines the 

transfer of such funds to the National Treasury if warranted, otherwise the 

reversion thereof to the general fund of the government pursuant to DOF-

DBM-COA PC Joint Circular No. 4- 2012 and Section 99, PD No. 1445. 

 

49. Cash amounting to CAD72,133.75.00 remained in the depository banks of the 
Post since July 31, 2011, more than eight years as at date of audit on September 

9, 2019, in violation of EO No. 338, depriving the national government of the use 

thereof for other projects. (PCG Vancouver) 

 

We recommended that the Post remit the cash balance under the Local 

Currency Savings Account No. 9400-0902-5389390 with TD Canada Trust to the 

BTr. 

 

 

 



110 
 

Collections not deposited intact daily 

 

50. The Collecting Officer (CO) failed to deposit her collections intact and in full to 
the AGDB daily or not later than the next banking day resulting in undeposited 

collections at the end of the month thus, exposing said government funds to 

unnecessary risk of loss through theft or misappropriation. (PE Abuja) 

 

We recommended the CO to deposit her collections intact and in full to 

the AGDB daily or not later than the next banking day. 

 

 

ORs/Checks not issued in strict numerical sequence 

 

51. The CO issues official receipts not strictly in numerical sequence hence, 
corresponding collections are not reported and deposited promptly, not in 

accordance with existing regulations. (PE Abuja) 

 

We recommended that the CO issue the official receipts in strict 

numerical sequence as required by existing regulations. 

 

52. Some checks drawn by the Post, both for local and foreign currency bank 
accounts, for the period July 10, 2018 to September 9, 2019 were not issued in 

numerical sequence, while cancelled checks were not reported in the registry, 

indicating weakness of control over the said accountable form. (PCG 

Vancouver) 

 

We recommended that the Post strictly monitor the issuance of checks to 

avoid the same lapses in the future, and the FO to be thorough in reporting all 

cancelled checks. 

 

 

Duplicate recording of ORs in Cash Receipt Register 

 

53. Collections of Expedite Consular Service Fees (ECSF) which are considered 
contributions to Provident Fund, along with other consular fees, covered by one 

single and similar ORs (FA Form No. 89) are recorded separately and 

repeatedly in the Cash Receipts Register (CRReg) for General Fund and for 

Provident Fund, thereby causing confusion in the presentation and audit of 

accountabilities of concerned accountable officer.  (PCG Shanghai) 

 

We recommended that the Post record all collections including ECSF in 

the General Fund only indicating the ORs as proof of payments made and to 

subsequently record and transfer all ECSF payments on a monthly basis under 

the account Provident Fund referring only to the collections made for ECSF 

during the entire month. 



111 
 

In PE Singapore, verification of records showed instances of erroneous 

recording of deposits in the CRReg for 2018, thus, affecting the accuracy of the 

reported balances.  

 

We recommended that the CO concerned exercise more caution in the 

preparation of the CRReg in order to present more accurate financial reports. 

 

Erroneous reporting of collections and deposits in the Cash Receipts Record 

 

54. Errors in reporting amounts of collections and deposits in the Cash Receipts 
Record (CRR) of the CO were observed because the CO failed to balance her 

collection with her cash on hand daily and reconcile the balance with the 

subsidiary records kept at the DFA-Home Office Accounting at least quarterly.  

(PE Abuja) 

 

We recommended the CO to maintain the cashbook/CRR with caution 

making sure that the amount entered in the cashbook/CRR are correct, and 

footings are accurate.  We also recommend the CO to reconcile the CRR with 

the accounting records at least quarterly. 

 

 

Improper establishment of officer’s accountabilities 

 

55. Direct accountability from an accountable officer designated as CO for 
collections during Consular Outreach Activities was not properly established 

because her collections are considered as part of the collections of another CO, 

thus, proper management of collections cannot be ensured.  (PE Madrid) 

 

 We recommended and the Post agreed to require the CO assigned to 

Consular Services to prepare the Report on Collections and Deposits (RCDs) of 

all her collections and deposits for proper accountability. 

 

The US Dollar cash on hand accountability of Ms. Victorina G. 

Macasalong as of June 30, 2019 certified by the OFMS, DFA-Home Office is not 

reliable as it cannot be duly established in audit.  (PE Tel Aviv) 

 

We urged the Post, especially Ms. Macasalong in coordination with the 

Finance Officer (FO), to initiate reconciliation of financial records with the HO 

Accounting Division. 

 

 

The mode of collection being implemented by the Post is outdated and cumbersome 

 

56. The Post accepts payments in cash only which is now considered outdated and 
cumbersome on the part of its clients. (PE Singapore) 



112 
 

Unrefunded excess fund transfer from COMELEC 

 

57. The fund transferred by Commission on Elections (COMELEC) to the Post 
intended for postage fees for the Election Mail Packets to Overseas Voters was 

not yet fully liquidated since the excess fund was not yet refunded as at audit 

date, contrary to No. 7, Clause No. III of the MOA between the COMELEC and 

DFA, depriving the government of its usage for other projects. (PCG 

Vancouver) 

 

We recommended that the Post instruct the Accountable Officer to 

immediately refund the unutilized amount to fully liquidate the fund transfer 

from COMELEC. 

 

 

Safe Deposit Vault for CO 

 

58. The CO has no safe deposit vault to keep undeposited cash collections, 
accountable forms and other important documents or papers thus exposing 

these items to loss or misuse. (PE Washington D.C.) 

 

We recommended that the CO to be provided with a safe deposit vault 

where undeposited cash collections, accountable forms and other important 

documents or papers be kept and stored to prevent them from being stolen, 

misused or lost. 

 

 

Late submission of Monthly Fiscal/Financial Reports 

 

59. Fiscal/Financial Reports (FRs) consisting of: Statement of Status of Working 
Funds, Bank Reconciliation Statement, Cash in Bank Register, Cash Receipts 

Register, Cash Disbursement Register, Subsidiary Statement of Disbursements, 

among others, were not submitted within the prescribed period as provided in 

Section 492 of the Philippine Foreign Service Code which resulted in the delay 

in the recording of Post’s transactions in the Head Office (HO), the 

reconciliation and adjustments in the reports if needed and the preparation and 

finalization of the year-end financial statements. (PE Washington D.C., PCG 

Vancouver) 

 

We recommended that the Post set deadlines for the completion of all 

required reports and supporting papers to ensure the timely submission of FRs 

to the DFA-Home Office in conformity with the deadline set by the Foreign 

Service Code.  

 

 

 

 



113 
 

Untimely/Non-submission of collection account returns 

 

60. Delayed submission of CY 2019 collection account returns by the Honorary 
Consul (Hon Con) in Barcelona, Spain ranging from 21 to 142 days inconsistent 

with the Agreement and Section 31 of Department Order No. 04-2018, precluded 

the Post, as the Supervising Post, from timely reviewing the returns for 

completeness and accuracy and recording of collections as income by the Post. 

(PE Madrid) 

 

We recommended and the Post agreed: 

 

a. to demand, in writing, from the honorary consular officer concerned to 
comply with the accomplishment and submission of collection account 

returns enumerated in Section 31, Department Order No. 04-2018; and to 

fulfill her responsibilities under the Agreement; and 

 

b. to consider these repeated failures to submit the collection account returns 
on time, when assessing the performance of the honorary consular officer 

and as basis for possible revocation of the Agreement. 

 

61. The Honorary Consular Offices have not submitted the required monthly 
collection account returns as of December 31, 2018. (PE Abuja) 

 

We recommended that the Post remind the concerned Honorary 

Consular Offices of their responsibility to submit the required monthly 

collection account returns pursuant to the Agreement and as required by 

paragraph 24.a of DFA Department Order No. 32-94 dated July 18, 1984. 

 

We also recommended that the Supply Officer to maintain a record of 

ORs issued to the Honorary Consul and the Post to strictly monitor the 

submission by the Honorary Consul of monthly collection account returns. 

 

 

Insufficient fidelity bond/CO not duly bonded 

 

62. The amount of the Fidelity Bond for the accountability of the CO, Ms. Victorina 
G. Macasalong, is not sufficient to cover the maximum amount of accountability 

she handled, thus disadvantageous to the government and contrary to Treasury 

Circular No. 02-2009 dated August 6, 2009 issued by the Bureau of Treasury. 

(PE Tel Aviv) On the other hand, the CO of PE Abuja was not duly bonded. 

 

We recommend for the DFA-Home Office to consider this observation 

and the request of the Post in order to protect the interest of the government in 

case loss of funds would occur. 

 



114 
 

We also recommended that the Post should follow up the approval of the 

application for her bonding by the CO in order to comply with Section 66, of the 

GAAM, Volume I; Section 101(2) of PD No. 1445; and Section 1 of DFA 

Department Order No. 03-05, dated January 10, 2005 in coordination with the 

DFA-Home Office. 

 

  

Use of Bank Credit Card for Post Expenditures 

 

63. The use of the Embassy Credit Card in the name of the FO to pay for 
maintenance and operating expenses was not duly authorized by the Head of 

Post thus exposing Post’s funds to loss or misuse for the unauthorized use of the 

credit card. (PE Washington, D.C.) 

 

We recommended that the Head of Post issue an order to authorize and 

regulate the use of the credit card and fix responsibility for the expenses 

incurred for its use.  

 

 

Non-posting of fees, charges and assessments 

 

64. The schedule fees, charges and assessments collectible by the Post is not posted 
on the Post’s website and in a conspicuous place. (PE Madrid) 

 

We recommended and the Post agreed to post the fees, charges and 

assessments collectible by the Post on its website and in bold characters in the 

public area or in a conspicuous place within the premises of the Post for the 

information of all concerned. 

 

 

ACCOUNTABLE FORMS MANAGEMENT 

 

Issuance of Accountable Forms (AFs) without acknowledgement receipt 

 

65. Issuances of Visa Stickers to the Consular Services Division (CSD) were not 
properly documented, hence, the transfer of accountability from the Property 

Officer (PO) to the Head of Consular Services Division on the accountable forms 

was not duly effected. (PE Singapore) 

 

We recommended that the Post require the PO to document properly the 

issuance of accountable forms to ensure that accountability over the accountable 

forms is also transferred.  Considering that accountable forms are part of 

Inventories, a Request and Issue Slip should be accomplished and a logbook 

where acknowledgment of receipts of accountable forms are recorded be 

maintained.   

 



115 
 

66. The Property Officer (PO) issued 2,147 pieces of AFs such as MRRV (VISA 
Form), Travel Document, and NBI Forms to the Accountable Officers 

(AOs)/Honorary Consuls (HonCons) without acknowledgement of receipt 

thereof by the latter, that thereby, transfer of accountability could not be 

ensured and the issuances of accountable forms could not be properly 

monitored. (PE Madrid) 

 

We recommended and the Post agreed that the PO require the 

AOs/HonCons to acknowledge receipt of the AFs they requested to ensure that 

accountability therefor is transferred from the PO to the AOs/HonCons and that 

the issuance of the AFs is properly monitored. 

 

 

Lack of monitoring and accounting of AFs 

 

67. Lack of monitoring for accountable forms issued to HonCons, which is 
inconsistent with the principle of internal control enunciated in Section 123 of 

PD No. 1445, resulted in unaccounted accumulated AFs and in their exposure to 

possible loss and misuse. (PE Madrid) 

 

We recommended and the Post agreed that: 

 

a. the PO maintain an updated monitoring record of accountable forms to 
include the accountable forms issued, utilization and balance of unused 

forms on hand of the HonCons; 

 

b. the FO furnish the PO the updated record on the utilization of the forms 
based on the submitted collections reports of the HonCons as the basis of 

the PO in the issuance of additional forms to avoid accumulation of the 

forms in the custody of the HonCons; and  

 

c. the Post make a representation with the DFA-Home Office to include in the 
Agreement relating to the Appointment of the HonCon, the responsibility 

of the HonCon to account for the accountable forms issued to him/her in 

accord with Department Order No. 04-2018 and other existing DFA 

regulations. 

 

 

Non-compliance with the immediate notice of loss of Accountable Forms (AFs) 

 

68. The loss of 262 pieces of AFs issued to the two HonCons of Palma de Mallorca 
was not immediately reported, which is inconsistent with COA Circular No. 84-

233, thus, the prevention against possible fraudulent use of such AFs could not 

be ensured. (PE Madrid) 

 



116 
 

We recommended and the Post agreed to adhere to the immediate 

reporting requirements for lost or missing accountable forms provided in COA 

Circular No. 84-233.  The head of the Post is not precluded from resorting to 

such other measures which he deems necessary or appropriate to prevent the 

fraudulent use of lost accountable forms. 

 

 

Unused Accountable Forms 

 

69. Obsolete and accountable forms which cannot be used to transactions in the Post 
were kept and stored at the Consular Office thereby unnecessarily increasing 

the accountability of the CO for accountable forms.  (PE Washington D.C.)  

 

We recommended that BIR Form No. 24.25 be returned to the DFA HO 

for proper disposition in line with the requirement and applicable provisions of 

PD 1445. 

 

70. There were 208 pieces of MRVS and 500 pieces (ten stubs) of ORs which were 
received by the Post in 2015 and 2017, respectively, but still unused as of audit 

date and awaiting final instructions from the DFA-Home Office. (PCG Toronto) 

 

We recommended that the Post follow-up with the HO for the 

final/appropriate action to take on the use of the MRVS and ORs. The Post may 

likewise consider submitting a request for authority to use the ORs with serial 

number 8038501-8039000 and adjust the Post record maintained by the HO as 

to the ORs issued/delivered, for proper accountability. 

 

71. Checks that have long not been used were not disposed of but were retained by 
the Post, which is not in accordance with sound internal control practice to 

avoid/prevent possible unauthorized use.  (PE Tel Aviv) 

 

The comment of the Post is well taken.  Nonetheless, it may be prudent 

for the Post to plan its buying of checks with adequacy in numbers as the end 

view considering the seemingly restrictive banking environment in Israel. 

 

 

Monthly Report of Accountability for Accountable Forms (MRAAF) 

 

72. MRAAF for official receipts (FA Form 89) and visa stickers requisitioned and 
received by the PO from the DFA-Home Office is not being prepared and 

submitted to the DFA Auditor for review and verification as required under 

Section 17(k), Volume I of GAM, hence, receipts and issuances of the same could 

not be properly monitored and accounted.  (PE Abuja)  

 



117 
 

We recommended that the PO should prepare and submit a MRAAF to 

facilitate the monitoring of the movement and status of the accountable forms 

in their custody in compliance with Section 17(k), Volume I of GAM.    

 

73.  In PE Tel Aviv, the Monthly RAAF for ORs were not accomplished in 
accordance with GAM for NGAs, Volume II thereby not reflecting the correct 

quantity of the beginning balances. (PE Tel Aviv) 

 

The commitment of the Post is well taken and is highly appreciated.  

Nevertheless, it is recommended that the CO in PE Tel Aviv be apprised, 

through seminars, of the rules and regulations on preparation of financial 

reports. 

 

 

PROPERTY MANAGEMENT 

 

Non-submission to the DFA-Home Office of documents relative to the donated property  

 

74. The Post overlooked the submission of documents to the DFA-Home Office 
relative to the donated piano (Mason and Risch) with a cost of CAD1,000.00; 

thus, resulting in the understatement of the balances/values of PPE as appearing 

in the accounting and property records of the DFA-Home Office.  (PCG 

Toronto) 

 

We recommended that the Post submit to the DFA-Home Office the 

documents pertinent to the donation for proper recording in the Accounting and 

Property records. 

 

 

Weaknesses of internal control system on property management 

 

75. Significant weaknesses were noted in the internal control over property and 
other assets of the Post like no identification posted on a prominent but secure 

portion of the property since the physical count was just recently conducted and 

undelivered vehicle was included in the physical inventory report it having been 

already paid, which are inconsistent with Section 123 of PD No. 1445 and Item 

V.2 of COA Circular No. 80-124, resulting in difficulty in identifying, 

monitoring/tracking the properties.  (PE Madrid) 

 

We recommended and the Post agreed to comply with Section 123 of PD 

No. 1445 and the guidelines for inventory-taking as provided under COA 

Circular No. 80-124 to enhance a sound internal control on property 

management. 

 

 

 



118 
 

Required records/reports are not maintained/prepared in accordance with the GAM   

 

76. Stock Cards (SCs) and Property Cards (PCs) were not maintained while the 
Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) and Property 

Acknowledgment Receipt (PAR) were not prepared in accordance with the 

prescribed form resulting in inadequacy of records on the PPE and inventories 

in its custody.  (PE Singapore, PCG Vancouver) 

 

We recommended that the Post require the PO to: 

 

a. maintain the property and stock cards which shall be reconciled with the 
accounting records as required under the GAM Volume I; 

 

b. require end-users to prepare RIS as basis for their request of supplies and 
materials, and the semi-expendable properties to be covered with ICS upon 

issuance; 

 

c. prepare RSMI at the end of each month based on RIS received;  
 

d. conduct physical inventory count of the supplies and materials in stock, 
determine if there is a shortage or overage, and prepare the corresponding 

RCPI in the prescribed form; and 

 

e. prepare the PAR based on the prescribed format showing the necessary 
information required under Appendix 71 of the GAM Volume II.  

 

77. PARs were not prepared by the PO for the years 2016-2018 in violation of 
Section 42(f), Volume I of GAM, thus actual accountability of the properties 

could not be determined.  (PE Abuja) 

 

We recommended that the PO prepare and issue PAR for every 

equipment or property issued to officials and employees of the Post to establish 

actual responsibility and accountability on the proper care, utilization and 

safekeeping of the asset, in conformity with existing rules and regulations. 

 

We also recommend that the PO renew the PAR issued to officials and 

employees every three (3) years or whenever there is a change in 

custodianship/user of the property. 

 

 

Discrepancy and Overstocking of Inventory Supplies 

 

78. Discrepancies between the Stock Card and results of validation made to several 
inventory items are found. Moreover, there is overstocking of some inventory 

items contrary to Internal Control on Property and Supply Management.  Thus, 



119 
 

said discrepancies and overstocking could lead to loss or wastage due to the 

inefficient accounting and monitoring of inventory supplies.  (PCG Shanghai) 

 

We recommended that the Post require the PO to update all stock cards 

and review the automation or computation of balances per inventory item to 

arrive at the correct balance on hand. 

 

We further recommended that the PO closely monitor all purchases and 

issuances so as not to overstock inventories and to maintain only the maximum 

requirement as prescribed in auditing rules and regulations. 

 

 

Absence of RPCI for semi-expendable properties 

 

79. No RPCI for semi-expendable properties was prepared, instead, an RPCPPE 
was used to report these items which is not in accordance with GAM for NGAs.  

New property tags/labels for PPEs and semi-expendable properties were found 

not attached to the said properties.  (PE Tel Aviv)  While in PCG Vancouver, 

Inventory Custodial Slip (ICS) has yet to be utilized for the semi-expendable 

properties.  

 

We appreciate the prompt action of the Post on this observation.  The 

commitment of the Post is well taken, subject to validation on the next audit 

cycle.  We further recommended that the PO be apprised, through seminars of 

the rules and regulations on reporting of PPEs as required in GAM for NGAs. 

 

 

Absence of Proper Turn-over of Property Accountability 

 

80. There was no turn-over of property accountability as required under Section 42. 
J, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I between the outgoing and the 

incoming POs which resulted in the failure to prepare an updated, accurate and 

reliable Report on the RPCPPE for all the PPE of the Post.   (PE Washington 

D.C.) 

 

We recommended that the outgoing PO be required to properly turn-

over his property accountabilities to the incoming PO and to accomplish the 

Property Transfer Report in compliance with the GAM for NGAs.  We further 

recommended that considering that the previous PO failed to prepare such 

transfer report, the incumbent PO has to update the RPCPPE and thereafter 

verify and conduct an inventory or physical count of these property to determine 

their existence and physical condition.  

 

 

 

 



120 
 

Conduct of inspection/inventory 

 

81. The Post’s property Inventory Report showed erroneous data where several 
properties were listed twice, unserviceable assets were still included, not all 

items in the inventory list have property numbers and unit values, several 

properties were not included and there were errors in their exact location all of 

which resulted in the property accountability of the Head of Post and PO not 

being properly reported or presented and the risk that these properties could 

not be accounted for when they are lost or misplaced.  (PE Washington D.C.) 

 

We recommended that the Post correct the errors and indicate the 

lacking data in its inventory report or the RPCPPE by considering the following: 

 

a. indicating the cost and property number of each and every item; 
b. correction of double entries of property; 
c. indicating the exact location of the property; 
d. removal or exclusion of unserviceable properties; and 
e. inclusion of existing properties not included. 

 

Moreover, the Post shall assess the value of unserviceable properties and 

determine the most advantageous scheme of disposing the same; and request 

authority and dispose the same in accordance with existing rules and 

regulations. 

 

Also, Post is required to account the properties not presented during 

inspection and the 10 pieces of art works reported missing. 

 

 

Incomplete RPCPPE, Absence of Unit Value of certain items in the RPCPPE and 

Property Tags/ Stickers                  

 

82. The RPCPPE is incomplete since certain properties of the Post have not been 
included, others have no unit values and property tags which result in the risk 

that property loss and the amount of loss as well as their whereabouts could not 

readily be known or detected.   (PE Washington D.C., PCG Vancouver) 

 

We recommended that the Post require the PO to: 

 

a. use the format prescribed under Appendix 73 under Volume II of the GAM 
in the preparation of the RPCPPE; 

 

b. strictly comply with the provisions of COA Circular No. 80-184 dated 
January 18, 1980 in relation to the property identification and coding. 

 



121 
 

We also recommended and the Post agreed to ensure that the RPCPPE 

be updated to include all properties of the Post and that these properties be 

placed with property tags and be subjected to regular annual physical count. 

 

83. Several pieces of Artworks which are possessed and owned by the PE were listed 
together with ordinary property in the RPCPPE where some of these Artworks 

have no unit values resulting in the risk of loss and the difficulty of fixing the 

amount of accountability of these Artworks.   (PE Washington D.C.) 

 

We recommended that a Registry of Heritage Assets (RHA) and a 

Registry of Heritage Assets Summary (RHAS) be prepared for Artworks and 

appropriate PAR be issued to whom these Artworks were issued. We further 

recommend that they have to be valued at acquisition cost if acquired by 

purchase or at fair value at the date of acquisition if acquired thru non-exchange 

transaction following the procedures and as required by the GAM for NGAs. 

 

Absence of acquisition costs of some items of PPEs and Semi-Expendable properties 

 

84. A total of 58 items without their corresponding acquisition cost were included 
in the RPCPPE for Capital Outlay Cluster and Semi-Expendable, thus the 

accountability of the PO cannot be established.  (PE Tel Aviv).   

 

We recommended for the Post to exert effort for the determination of the 

individual acquisition cost of these properties. 

 

 

Unserviceable items not disposed and non-preparation of Inventory and Inspection 

Report of Unserviceable Properties (IIRUP) 

 

85. Deficiencies were observed in the recording of PPE such as: (a) non-recording 
of unserviceable items in the IIRUP; (b) non-disposal of unserviceable 

properties; and (c) duplication in assigning property numbers in some property 

items, rendering the PPE account unreliable.  (PCG Shanghai, PCG Vancouver) 

 

We recommended that the Post: 

 

a. require the PO to locate the whereabouts of the identified and undeclared 
properties and if existing and serviceable, the same be included in the 

RPCPPE.  However, if the items are no longer serviceable, the same be listed 

in the IIRUP; 

 

b. mark or label the personal property, leased property and those component 
of the office under lease found at the Post to guide and facilitate validation 

of records versus physical existence;  

 



122 
 

c. require the PO to include all unserviceable properties that are not yet 
disposed in the IIRUP to serve as basis in dropping from the books and to 

facilitate the disposal thereof in accordance with the rules; and 

 

d. require the PO to review the property numbers issued and make necessary 
adjustments in the records of the Post for proper identification, control and 

recording. 

 

86. There were items which were either “for repair”, “unserviceable” or “expired”, 
however, no request for authority from the DFA-Home Office for their repair 

or disposal, as the case may be, has been made.  (PE Tel Aviv) 

 

We appreciate the commitment of the Post.  It is recommended further 

for the Post to make representation to the DFA-Home Office for their timely 

release of funds allotted for repairs so that repair requirements for all other 

PPEs can be attended on time. 

 

87. The PO did not prepare the required Inventory and IIRUP for the years 2016-
2018.  (PE Abuja) 

 

We recommended that a Disposal Committee created for the purpose to 

dispose all unserviceable properties of the Post found to be valuable through sale 

to generate revenue which could be used in their operation.  Other disposable 

properties which are found to be valueless or unsaleable, may be destroyed in 

their presence.  As an initial step to the disposal of the said unserviceable 

properties, an IIRUP should first be prepared and submitted to the DFA Head 

Office for review, evaluation and approval. 

 

 

Uninsured Property, Plant and Equipment 

 

88. Property that are classified as PPE were not covered with insurance under the 
Government Insurance Fund (GIF) as mandated in the Property Insurance 

Law; thus, the Post has no adequate and reliable protection against any damage 

to or loss of its property/assets and interests due to fire, earthquake, storm or 

other fortuitous events.  (PCG Shanghai) 

 

We recommended and the Post agreed to follow-up the issuance of 

directive from DFA-Home Office pertaining to its compliance with RA No. 656 

or the Property Insurance Law so as not to deny the PCG of adequate and 

reliable protection against any damage to or loss of its properties or assets and 

interests due to fire, earthquake, storm or other fortuitous events. 

 

 

 

 



123 
 

Augmentation of Staff for Property Accountability 

 

89. The Post lacks personnel to serve the overloaded duties of the PO which resulted 
in incomplete property records and reports, the absence of proper turn-over 

from the outgoing to the incumbent PO and the Post’s properties not being 

properly safeguarded and accounted for.  (PE Washington D.C.) 

 

We recommended that additional staff be designated and duly bonded as 

PO to be responsible for the over-all custody and safekeeping of all the property 

assets of the Embassy.  

 

 

Insufficient office space 

 

90. The chancery has a limited office space and is inadequate to accommodate its 
clients/applicants for services.  Also, the consular office does not have enough 

room to seat all clients transacting at the embassy especially during peak period, 

that thereby handicaps the Post’s operations.  (PE Madrid) 

 

We recommended and the Post agreed to make a strong representation, 

through the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, for funding and 

consideration for its proposal to seek another place elsewhere for the 

Ambassador’s residence so that the Consular Offices can move to the 

Ambassador’s residence should it be vacated. 

 

 

PROCUREMENT 

 

Advance payment on the purchase of motor vehicle 

 

91. The Post paid in full the amount of €57,892.11 or its equivalent of 
PhP3,499,999.49 into the bank account (No. ES0201280899740100005181) of 

BMW Madrid S.L. with the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) for the 

purchase of one-unit motor vehicle – BMW 730Ld Berlina, not yet delivered, 

which is contrary to Section 88 of PD No. 1445, thereby exposing government 

funds to risk of possible loss that could result from the supplier’s failure to 

deliver the vehicle.  (PE Madrid) 

 

We recommended that the Post require BMW Madrid S.L. to 

immediately post performance security pursuant to Item 3.f, Annex A to GPPB 

Resolution No. 28-2017 to protect it (the Post) against possible loss in the event 

that the latter fails to deliver the vehicle or defaults on its obligations under the 

contract (Order Form). 

 

 

 



124 
 

Incomplete documentary requirements on procurement 

 

92. In the procurement of goods and repairs of the Post’s facilities totaling 
€113,639.91, the documentary requirements were not complete, which is 

contrary to Section 4 of PD No. 1445, COA Circular No. 2012-001, and GPPB 

Resolution No. 28-2017, thus affecting the validity and propriety of these 

transactions.  (PE Madrid) 

 

We recommended and the Post agreed to (i) request from the DFA-Home 

Office a retooling seminar and simplified guide in the conduct of the 

procurement process aligned with the guidelines issued under GPPB Resolution 

No.           28-2017; and (ii) comply with Section 4 of PD No. 1445 and COA 

Circular No. 2012-001. 

 

 

Non-compliance with procurement law  

 

93. The PCG entered into two Machine Rental Service Contract and one 
Maintenance Service Contract with Shanghai Sanhe Hengchen Office 

Equipment Co., Ltd. (SSHOECL) for a contract period of one year from 

January to December 2019, thru direct contracting instead of small value 

procurement, in violation of the pertinent provisions of RA No. 9184.  (PCG 

Shanghai) 

 

We recommended and the Post agreed to require the Bids and Awards 

Committee to adhere strictly to the pertinent provisions of RA No. 9184 and the 

2016 Revised IRR on the succeeding procurement of the Post; and 

 

For economy, we likewise recommended for the Post to reiterate its 

request for funding from DFA-Home Office in order to directly purchase 

copier/scanner machines and other office equipment needed by the Post. 

 

 

PROGRAM MANAGEMENT 

 

Bidding and Awarding of Funded Projects for CY 2019 

  

94. Several funded projects for the repair of infrastructure and infrastructure-
related projects of the Post remain unawarded as the bidding processes for these 

projects have just either commenced or are still in progress resulting in the risk 

that these projects may not be materialized when their funds would be 

demanded by or returned to the DBM or to the funding source in the event that 

the awards to qualified bidders would not be issued during the year.    (PE 

Washington D.C.) 

 



125 
 

We recommended that the Post expedites the bidding process for the 

unawarded projects so that the awards to the winning bidders can be issued 

during the year in order to obligate and prevent the return of these funds to the 

DBM or to the funding sources and thereby ensure the realization of these 

projects. 

 

 

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 

 

95. The accomplishments of the Post exceeded some of the programs/targets for CYs 
2017, 2018 and as of September 2019.  (PCG Shanghai) 

 

We commended the Post for its recorded achievements, with a 

recommendation that in the succeeding years the Post prepare a work and 

financial plan showing the targets and budgetary requirements. 

 

 

No Quality Output for Office Performance Commitment and Review (OPCR) 

 

96. The Post reported no output for Quality and reported low output ratings of 14-
22 percent for Quantity in the OPCR for 2018 thus resulting in a partial score 

of only 60 percent during the year.  (PE Abuja) 

 

We recommended that the Post sets measureable targets and realistic 

accomplishments in terms of Quantity and Quality outputs to aid Management 

in reviewing the ratings and making recommendations on Learning and 

Development which will be part of development plan for human resources, as 

well as input to the strategic plan for the succeeding year. 

 

97. The data in the 2017 OPCR/WP are disaggregated while the 2019 OPCR/WP is 
not available.  (PE Tel Aviv) 

 

We recommended for the Post to make the data contained in the OPCR 

verifiable by providing source documents therefor. 

 

98. The data contained in the Accomplishment Report (AR) of the Consular Section 
for 2017 to 2019 slightly differed from those verified by the team from the 

Cumulative Report of Income and Collection (CRIC) for the same period. (PE 

Tel Aviv) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



126 
 

ASSISTANCE TO NATIONALS (ATN) / LEGAL ASSISTANCE FUND (LAF) 

 

Non-preparation and submission of reports  

 

99. The prescribed Report of Utilization of the Assistance to Nationals (ATN) Fund 
was not prepared and submitted to respective offices in DFA-Home Office; 

hence, it could not be determined whether the funds were utilized for the 

purpose it was requested and in the amount authorized.  (PCG Shanghai) 

 

We recommended that the Post require the FO to prepare and timely 

submit to the respective offices in DFA-Home Office the reports on the 

utilization of ATN Funds in the format prescribed under MC No. 03-2019 dated 

June 27, 2019. 

 

 

Performance Targets for ATN Services 

 

100. The OPCR/ Work Plan of the Post for the years 2017-2019 for 
programs/activities/projects pertaining to Consular and ATN services 

chargeable against the LAF is unrealistic as it has no targeted commitment for 

such services which would result in the difficulty of reporting of 

accomplishments in the OPCR in case there would be disbursements for 

Consular or ATN cases that would be charged against the LAF and the 

misimpression that the LAF is not necessary for Consular or ATN cases.  (PE 

Washington D.C.) 

 

Non-preparation of ATN Fund Utilization Targets/Financial Plan and no 

provision for ATN Standby Fund, thus the Post might not be able to address 

urgent cases or needs of Filipino nationals. (PCG Shanghai) 

 

We reiterated the recommendation that the Post/ATN Unit prepare a 

work and financial plan and be granted the appropriate Standby Facility for 

regular ATN cases to enable the Post to address urgent needs that may befall 

Filipino nationals within its jurisdiction at all times, not only on cases with 

extreme urgency but even for unexpected and regular ATN cases. 

 

101. The Post has no ATN Emergency/ Standby Fund purposely for emergency ATN 
cases which results in the risk of failure for the Post to meet and address 

emergency cases involving Filipinos in distress due to the absence of readily 

available funds.  (PE Washington, D.C.) 

 

We recommended that the Head of Post request for the setting up of an 

ATN Emergency/Standby Fund at the Post to address emergency ATN cases 

following the procedures prescribed under DFA Memorandum Circular 01-08-

A dated February 1, 2011 at an amount determined by the Secretary of Foreign 

Affairs as recommended by the OUMWA and the OFM. 



127 
 

 

102. The nature of some expenditures charged to the ATN Fund do not appear to fall 
within those specifically allowed under DO. Nos. 16-2017 and 08-2019 dated 

December 18, 2018 and April 5, 2019, respectively, hence, may affect the 

availability of the Fund for its intended purpose.  (PE Tel Aviv) 

 

Owing to the limited funds, the Team highly recommends due observance 

of the guidelines on the utilization of the fund to maximize its viability. 

 

103. The absence of limit in terms of amount that may be expended out of the ATN 
Fund per case and the seeming “dole out” nature thereof may affect the 

sustainability and availability of the fund appropriated for the Post, thus, may 

limit the number of distressed Filipinos who may benefit from it.  (PE Tel Aviv) 

 

The Post concurred in the observation and committed to make 

representation in the DFA-Home Office to include limitation and 

reimbursement clauses in the Memorandum Circular to be issued. 

 

104. The PCG-Shanghai entered into Contract on Engagement of Legal Advisor with 
Beijing Yingke Law Firm Shanghai Office on March 15, 2018 and paid the 

retainer fee of RMB50,000.00 (USD6,944.44) for the one-year contract period on 

April 18, 2018. 

 

We recommended that the Post refrain from making advance payment 

for any services not yet rendered, or any goods not yet delivered for that matter, 

being contrary to existing law, auditing rules and regulations. 

 

105. In the procurement of legal services, the Post did not obtain quotations from at 
least three (3) qualified and independent legal service providers or law Firms, 

as specifically required by DO Nos. 15-2017 and 07-2019, hence, the most 

qualified, responsive and economical Law Firm may not have been contracted, 

thus the interest of both the government and OFWs in need of legal services 

might not have been aptly protected. 

 

The justification of the Post is well taken.  Nonetheless, we urge the Post 

to secure prior authorization from the DFA-Home Office to be exempt from 

complying the requirement for similar circumstances as this. 

 

 

OVERSEAS ABSENTEE VOTING (OAV) 

 

Updating of Voter’s Database 

 

106. A total of 1,208 ballot packets were returned to sender while 617 ballots were 
unsent and five boxes containing a total of 879 return to sender ballot packets 

were received after the 13 May 2019 elections since the voters’ addresses in the 



128 
 

Post’s database were either missing or incomplete and the voters did not respond 

to the announcements on how to claim their ballots all of which contributed to 

the low turn-out of votes from registered voters under the jurisdiction of the PE 

in Washington D.C.  

 

We recommended and the Post agreed to regularly update its database 

of voters specifically on their addresses through the periodic issuance of 

Announcements or Advisories, either quarterly or semestrally, to reduce these 

return to sender, unsent ballot cases caused by missing, incomplete or change of 

addresses of registered voters to improve voter turn-out.  

 

 

Disposal of Election Materials and Paraphernalia       

                                               

107. Several election materials, equipment and paraphernalia pertaining to the 2016 
and 2019 elections which are due for disposal are still kept in the Post which 

exposes it to liability in the event that they are lost or damaged.  (PE Washington 

D.C.) 

 

We recommended that the Post, thru the HO, seek authority and make 

representation with COMELEC for the proper disposal of these election 

materials, equipment and paraphernalia from the 2016 and 2019 elections. We 

also recommend that in the event that the disposal of these items are to be done 

at the Post, the cost of disposal has to be requested from and be borne by 

COMELEC. 

 

 

GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT (GAD) 

 

GAD Program not implemented 

 

108. The implementation of GAD for CY 2016-2018 as required by Joint Circular 
No. 2004-01 dated April 5, 2004 of DBM and NEDA was not fully undertaken, 

thus, depriving its officers and employees of the benefits that will be derived 

from the program.  (PE Abuja) 

 

We recommended that the Post prepare and submit an Approved 

Annual GAD Plan.  Likewise, projects as planned and budgeted should be 

carried out and executed properly.   The amounts/funds spent for GAD related 

programs, projects and activities should be reflected in the financial report for 

easy monitoring, verification and validation. 

 

We likewise recommended that an annual GAD plan, budget and 

accomplishment reports to be prepared following the policy guidelines set forth 

by DBM, NEDA & NCRFW Joint Circular No. 2004-1, requiring all 



129 
 

government agencies to formulate an annual plan and budget designed to 

address gender issues within their concerned sector. 

 

We further recommended that the post to include only those programs, 

activities and projects that directly address gender issues and concerns that are 

well-defined to avoid duplication of or overlapping with the regular activities.  

GAD activities should conform to the objectives and advocacy of the agency.
