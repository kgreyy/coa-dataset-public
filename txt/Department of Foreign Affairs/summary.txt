 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

 

A. Introduction 
 

The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) was established as an independent 

agency in June 1952 under Republic Act (RA) No. 708, known as the Magna Carta of 

the Foreign Service, although it was formally created in June 1898 with the birth of 

the first Philippine Republic.  On September19, 1991, RA No. 708 was revised by RA 

No. 7157, also known as the “Philippine Foreign Service Act of 1991”. 

 

The DFA is entrusted with crafting, coordinating and implementing Philippine 

foreign policy to advance the interests of the Philippines and the Filipino people in the 

world community.  It discharges its duties through the following fundamental policy 

planks: 

 

• Contribution to the preservation and enhancement of national security, 
including the protection of territorial integrity and national sovereignty; 

• Promotion of economic security, while ensuring inclusive growth and 
sustainable development; and 

• Protection of the rights and promotion of the welfare and interest of Filipinos 
overseas, recognizing them as partners in national development. 

 

The various offices at the Home Office (HO) are supported by six Satellite 

Offices located in premier malls in Metro Manila, 30 Regional Consular Offices 

(RCOs), 94 Foreign Service Posts (FSPs) worldwide and 175 Honorary Consulates 

(HCs) in selected locations where embassies/consulates are not present. Three attached 

agencies are directly supervised by the Department Secretary: 

 

• Foreign Service Institute (FSI); 

• UNESCO National Commission for the Philippines (UNACOM); and 

• Technical Cooperation Council of the Philippines (TCCP) 
 

The Department is headed by Secretary Teodoro L. Locsin, Jr.  It has a total of

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of the DFA for CY 2020.  It was 

conducted to:  a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the 

Management’s assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the propriety of 

transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and 

regulations; c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and d) determine the 

extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.  Moreover, the audit 

was conducted in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 

Institutions (ISSAIs).   

 

 

E. Auditor’s Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 

We rendered adverse opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial 

statements of DFA due to the following: 

 

1. Understatement of accounts Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account 
and Trust Liabilities by ₱2,467,487.01 due to unrecorded interest income 

earned from the Trust Fund account for CY 2020 and prior years. 

 

2. Existence of negative balances of several bank accounts amounting to 
₱252,873,986.17 in Cash in Bank-Foreign Currency accounts.   

 

3. Understatement of accounts Due from National Government Agencies 
(NGAs) and Due to NGAs by ₱14,407,472.73 due to error in recording funds 

received and subsidiary ledgers (SL) with negative balances totaling 

₱18,918,030.14. 

 

4. Understatement of accounts Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers 
Inventory and Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) by ₱1,975,630.22 due to 

incorrect method of costing. 

 

5. Overstatement of Accountable Forms, Plates and Stickers Inventory and 
Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) accounts by ₱174,289,540.82 for obsolete 

blank passports that were not subjected to allowance for impairment. 

 

6. Understatement of accounts Land and Buildings by an estimated value of 
₱1,240,454,054.34 due to unrecognized property identified in the RPCPPEs 

of FSPs. 

 

7. Overstatement of account Construction in Progress (CIP)-Buildings and 
Other Structures by ₱920,840,393.21 and understatement of Buildings and 

Other Structures accounts by the same amount due to non-classification of 

fully paid and completed contracts/projects to the proper Property, Plant and 

Equipment (PPE) accounts. 



v 

 

 

8. Existence of accounts with negative balances totaling ₱210,590,998.66 of 
the account Advances for Operating Expenses. 

 

9. Understatement of accounts Advances to Officers and Employees and 
Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) by ₱6,661,665.50 due to failure to recognize 

the cash advances upon payment to accountable officers/lessors that resulted 

in negative balances of SLs upon liquidation of the advances. 

 

10.  Existence of accounts with abnormal balances aggregating ₱16,148,742.33 
in Accounts Payable. 

 

11. Existence of unidentified SL accounts with a total negative balance of 
₱406,556.93 in account Due to Pag-IBIG.  

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the other significant audit observations and corresponding 

recommendations which were communicated to concerned Management officials 

through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda (AOM), and detailed in Part II 

of the Report. Management comments were incorporated in the Report where 

appropriate: 

 

1. The Accounts Payable (A/P) balance of ₱837,741,345.40 under Regular Agency 
Fund (RAF) was unreliable due to: (a) accounts outstanding for more than two 

years of ₱218,212,887.29; (b) unidentified accounts of ₱64,212,524.53; (c) 

existence of accounts with abnormal balances aggregating to ₱16,148,742.33; (d) 

variance of ₱12,845,258.52 between SL and confirmed balances from creditors; 

(e) dormant accounts of ₱16,630,946.80; (f) maintenance of multiple SL accounts 

of suppliers/creditors; and (g) double-booking on the set-up of payables totaling 

₱31,498.75. Moreover, the validity of A/P set up in CY 2020 with outstanding 

balance of ₱511,290,971.25 at year-end cannot be ascertained due to non-

submission of supporting documents. 

 

We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations and Management agreed to 

require the Chief Accountant to: 

 

a. review, analyze and revert all recorded payables that remained outstanding 
for two or more years pursuant to Executive Order (EO) No. 87; 

 

b. review the SL accounts “Others” and “Various Creditors”, work back on prior 
years’ accounts and exhaust all remedies to trace/gather documents of the 

recorded amounts to identify if these are valid obligations; 

 



vi 

 

c. reconcile the balance of accounts payable per books against the balances 
confirmed by the creditors; 

 

d. conduct a comprehensive analysis of dormant SL accounts and request for 
write-off, where applicable, in accordance with the procedures and 

requirements of COA Circular No. 97-001 dated February 5, 1997; 

 

e. effect necessary adjustments for erroneous entries; and 
 

f. reconcile accounts with multiple SLs and maintain only one SL for each 
creditor to present reliable SL account balances. 

 

We also recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant to 

ensure, henceforth, that all supporting documents of Journal Entry Vouchers 

(JEVs) setting up A/Ps are submitted to the Audit Team monthly or upon 

submission of the quarterly and year-end trial balance and financial statements to 

facilitate the review thereof. 

 

2. Utilization of cash allocations received during the year totaling 
₱21,056,090,722.00 was not maximized resulting in the reversion of a substantial 

amount of lapsed Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) of ₱8,293,835,376.17 or 39.39 

percent. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. instruct the concerned officials of the Office of Financial Management 
Services (OFMS) to strengthen the Department’s cash programming and 

management system through preparation of realistic disbursement program 

and accelerate the processing of claims to prevent the lapsing and reversion 

of huge amount of unused cash allocations; and 

 

b. review or revisit its target setting system including procurement practices to 
come up with a more practical budget; and closely monitor the 

implementation of programs, projects and activities (PPA) that were 

considered in the Monthly Disbursement Program (MDP) to optimize 

utilization of NCAs. 

 

3. The SL balances of the Cash in Bank-Foreign Currency accounts aggregating 
₱350,763,372.57 was unreliable due to the failure of the Accountant to reconcile 

the SLs with negative balances, unidentified bank balances, and to recognize the 

bank transfer of the bank accounts of closed post to the nearest posts, contrary to 

Section 74 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and Paragraph 27 of PPSAS 1, 

affecting the fair presentation of accounts in the financial statements. 

 

 

 



vii 

 

We recommend and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

 

a. continue to exert best effort to analyze and verify the details of unidentified 
bank accounts, negative balances, bank accounts of closed Posts and make 

appropriate adjustments in the books; 

 

b. reconcile accounting records with the Posts’ financial reports to ensure the 
completeness/correctness of the recorded bank accounts and to do away with 

maintaining SLs for non-existing bank accounts; 

 

c. ensure that all details in the SLs are correct as to the bank name and account 
number to facilitate verification and reconciliation; and 

 

d. maintain one SL per bank account instead of per Finance Officers (FO) to 
prevent abnormal balances of cash in bank accounts in instances where 

transfer of accountability from an outgoing to an incoming FO was not 

effected in the books. 

 

4. Failure to remit the balance of dormant accounts to the National Treasury resulted 
in the incurrence of bank charges and losses on foreign exchange totaling 

₱10,462,322.74 for the last three years alone, from CY 2018 balance of 

₱170,667,646.22 that decreased to ₱160,205,323.48 in CY 2020. 

 

We reiterated our previous years’ recommendation and Management agreed to 

require the concerned Posts, PCGs Osaka and Tokyo to facilitate the reconciliation 

of their accounts with Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), after 

which, consider the closing of these dormant bank accounts to avoid incurrence of 

losses and remit to the National Treasury to augment the funds to be used by the 

government for its priority projects. 

 

5. The Due from NGAs balance of ₱779,182,772.96 was unreliable due to: (a) 
discrepancy of ₱121,633,697.88 between DFA records and counterparties; (b) 

unidentified/ unclassified SL balances amounting to ₱161,916,959.90; (c) SLs 

with negative balances totaling ₱18,918,030.14; and (d) long outstanding 

receivables aged from three to more than ten years aggregating to 

₱999,381,647.97. 

 

We reiterated our previous year’s recommendations and Management agreed to 

require the Chief Accountant to: 

 

a. exert more effort to reconcile the discrepancies between the records of DFA 
and concerned agencies to establish the correct balance of the accounts; 

 

b. intensify the verification/analysis and location of related records and 
supporting documents of unidentified/unsupported balances; 

 



viii 

 

c. review and analyze the negative balances and effect necessary adjustments 
for erroneous entries and be mindful of the resulting abnormal balances for it 

signify accounting errors and omissions that could affect the correctness of 

the reported balances; and 

 

d. send demand letters supported with relevant reference documents to 
implementing/debtor agencies to liquidate/settle their accounts. Analyze the 

accounts aged 10 years and above if the balances had been unmoving or 

dormant, and request for write-off from the Commission on Audit (COA) in 

accordance with the guidelines and procedures prescribed under the COA 

Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. 

 

6. Interest earned from various bank accounts maintained under Passport Revolving 
Fund (PRF) and Trust Fund at the Home Office totaling ₱2,803,254.15 were not 

remitted to the National Treasury as of December 31, 2020, contrary to Section 

65 of PD No. 1445 depriving the government of additional funds to finance its 

programs/projects. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief Accountant to 

remit immediately to the National Treasury all interest income earned from bank 

accounts pursuant to existing laws and regulations. 

 

7. The balance of the account Advances for Operating Expenses in the amount of 
₱29,651,246.54 was highly unreliable due to existence of accounts with negative 

balances totaling ₱210,590,998.66 and normal account balances which were not 

moving for more than 10 years aggregating ₱188,062,014.68. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

a. exert more efforts to reconcile these abnormal balances and the accounts 
which are not moving for more than 10 years and draw JEV to adjust the 

accounting errors found in the process; and 

 

b. be mindful on the abnormal balances of the accounts for possible accounting 
errors that needed to be adjusted accordingly. 

 

8. Failure of the Accountable Officers (AOs) to liquidate advances for Living 
Quarters Allowance (LQA) as they fall due and the failure of the FOs to report 

the liquidation and the Accountant to monitor liquidation of cash advances 

resulted to accumulation of unliquidated balance of ₱14,280,470.24. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the: 

 

a. AOs, to liquidate immediately the cash advances as they fall due; 
 



ix 

 

b. FO and the Accountant to strictly monitor liquidation of cash advances and 
report/record immediately the liquidations pertaining to the particular period; 

and 

 

c. Accountant to coordinate with the Human Resource Management Office the 
Post of assignment for the actual tour of duty of those AOs who are no longer 

in the service and draw necessary JEV to recognize the liquidation 

corresponding to the period the cash advances were granted. 

 

9. Deficient supporting documents and certifications on disbursement vouchers 
(DVs) casted doubts on the validity and propriety of End-of-Service Benefits 

(ESB) transactions processed in CY 2018 totaling ₱165,912,177.60, contrary to 

Section 4(6-8) of PD No. 1445, COA Circular 2012-001 and Section 36, Chapter 

2, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM). 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the responsible officers of 

Office of the Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Affairs (OUMWA) to: 

 

a. submit to the Audit Team copies of death, marriage, birth certificates, and 
Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA)/ Overseas 

Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) certifications, and to 

prospectively attach these supporting documents to the DVs forwarded for 

audit, to establish validity of transactions; 

 

b. ensure that all DVs on the release of ESB are certified as to the completeness 
of supporting documents; and 

 

c. devise a monitoring or control measure or coordinate with Philippine National 
Bank (PNB) to confirm or ascertain the receipt of the ESB by the rightful 

beneficiary. 

 

10. The balance of reciprocal accounts Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds 
at year-end totaling ₱9,394,732.69 and ₱1,002,258.71, respectively, showed a 

variance of ₱8,392,473.98, thereby, casting doubt on the correctness and 

reliability of the balances. 

 

We recommend and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant to 

analyze and reconcile the balances of the reciprocal accounts especially those of 

prior years, and effect necessary adjustments to eliminate the difference. 

 

11. Segregation of duties and responsibilities was not observed in the processing of 
ESB transactions, reflecting inadequate internal control system in the 

management of ESB Trust funds. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to direct the concerned OUMWA 

officials to transfer the financial functions and responsibilities to the OFMS, 



x 

 

particularly the complete certification on box C of the DV by the Accountant; and 

to prepare Budget Utilization Request and Status (BURS) for all disbursements in 

accordance with the provisions of the GAM. 

 

12. Absence of prescriptive guidelines caused delays, from one to seven years, in the 
release of ESB totaling ₱66,530,688.40 to the beneficiaries, and funds of 

₱209,201,028.75 remained idle from 1 to 11 years in custodianship as of 

December 31, 2018. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to revisit and evaluate the relevance 

of Foreign Service Circular (FSC) No. 109-02 dated June 24, 2002 in relation to 

current practice, and prepare definitive and prescriptive guidelines and procedures 

in the handling of ESB especially in the processing of benefit claims to facilitate 

the immediate release to the beneficiaries. 

 

13. Amounts withheld from employees’ salaries representing employees 
contributions, insurance premiums and loan repayments and the government 

shares were not remitted in full to the GSIS as they fall due, contrary to the 

provision of RA No. 8291, which had accumulated to ₱28,497,360.99 due to the 

failure to monitor remittances of outstanding balances. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant to: 

 

a. remit immediately the outstanding balances including those of prior years;  
 

b. remit in full all GSIS contributions or payments withheld from the accounts 
of employees and its counterpart Government share on or before the set due 

dates; and 

 

c. strictly monitor remittances of withheld amounts to prevent accumulation and 
the incurrence of the corresponding penalties. 

 

14. The year-end balance of the account Due to Pag-IBIG of ₱1,479,284.89 did not 
represent the amounts withheld in December 2020 for remittance on the following 

month, but the accumulation of unremitted amounts through the years due to 

failure to remit in full all withheld amounts including the government share 

contrary to the provisions of RA No. 9679. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant to:  

 

a. remit immediately the outstanding balances including those of prior years; 
 

b. henceforth, remit in full all Pag-IBIG contributions/payments withheld from 
the accounts of employees and its counterpart Government share on or before 

the set due dates; 

 



xi 

 

c. exert more effort in the analysis, reconciliation and verification of records or 
supporting documents of unidentified/unclassified SL accounts and those 

with prolonged abnormal balances and effect the necessary adjustments; and 

 

d. record simultaneously from beginning/initial set-up, the Employee and 
Government Share, for easement of the matching principle. 

 

15. Employees’ contributions withheld from their salaries were not remitted in full to 
PhilHealth, contrary to Section 18(b) of the Revised Implementing Rules and 

Regulation (IRR) of RA No. 7875 as amended by RA Nos. 9241 and 10606, 

resulting in the accumulation of unremitted employees’ contributions of 

₱2,791,954.49. Likewise, an equally shared premium for CY 2020 and prior years 

representing government share totaling ₱1,468,402.54 were not recognized nor 

remitted contrary to the same law. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant to: 

 

a. remit immediately the overdue contributions to the PhilHealth and henceforth 
ensure the timely remittance of all monies due to PhilHealth; 

 

b. reconcile the variance on the equally shared premium contributions of 
Government and Employees and remit the same to PhilHealth; and 

 

c. strictly monitor remittances of withheld amounts to prevent accumulation and 
the incurrence of the corresponding penalties. 

 

16. The five percent allocation for Gender and Development (GAD) Fund was not 
fully complied with as prescribed by the Philippine Commission on Women 

(PCW)/ National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA)/ Department of 

Budget and Management (DBM) Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01 and as required 

under Section 31 of the General Provisions of the General Appropriation Act 

(GAA) for FY 2020.  Also, the agency failed to submit duly approved GAD Plan 

and Budget (GPB) and Accomplishment Report (AR) to the Audit Team pursuant 

to COA Circular 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to comply with the provisions of the 

GAA and Joint Circular 2012-001 regarding GAD fund allocation; and to instruct 

concerned officials to submit to the COA Audit Team the Annual GPB and 

corresponding AR within the period prescribed under COA Circular No. 2014-

001 for audit and evaluation thereof.
