EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)	Introduction



The National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS) was created under Presidential Decree (PD) No. 7 dated September 20, 1972, and went through a reorganization in 1987 and 1989, restoring it as an attached agency of the Department of Agriculture (DA).  With the issuance of Republic Act (RA) No. 9296, NMIS became a specialized regulatory agency on meat and meat product inspection and meat hygiene.



It is mandated to promulgate and implement policies, procedures, guidelines, rules, and regulations governing the post-production flow of livestock, meat, and meat products (both locally produced and imported) through the various stages of marketing and proper handling, inspection, processing, storage and preservation of such products; protect the interest, health and general welfare of the meat consuming public; endeavor for the development of the livestock and poultry industry and promote animal health in the meat industry.



NMIS has a Meat Inspection Board (MIB) established under RA No. 9296, tasked to develop the policies and guidelines on meat and meat product inspection and meat hygiene matters. The MIB is composed of the DA Secretary as Chairperson, and the Directors of NMIS, Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Bureau of Local Government Development (BLGD), Bureau of Agriculture and Fishery Product Standards (BAFPS) and representatives from consumer organizations duly recommended by the National Consumer Affairs Council, as Board members. NMIS is headed by Dr. Jocelyn A. Salvador, Executive Director, assisted by two Deputy Executive Directors for Operations and Administration, the Chiefs of the seven Divisions, and the Heads of the Regional Technical Operation Centers (RTOCs) in the 16 Regions. As of December 31, 2020, NMIS has a total workforce of 425 consisting of the following:

C)	Scope and Objectives of Audit 



The audit covered the transactions and accounts for CY 2020 and aimed to:                  (a) determine the level of assurance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) verify the propriety of transactions, as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations; (c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and (d) evaluate the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit recommendations.





















D)	Independent Auditor’s Report

	

An unqualified opinion was rendered on the Financial Statements due to the immediate adjustments/correction of the accounting errors and omissions amounting to ₱1,187.308 million and the unadjusted error and omission amounting to ₱3.458 million, which did not exceed the materiality level of ₱15.768 million, as shown in detail in Part II of the report.





E)	Significant Observations and Recommendations



1)	Overall, the agency’s fund utilization/obligation of ₱637.994 is 84.88 percent compared to its allotment of ₱751.619 million, of which 274.093 million or 36.47 percent pertains to one of its major programs, the Local Meat Establishment Assistance Program, which registered a utilization rate of 72.20 percent and in accordance with the purpose of allotment. The unutilized fund of ₱113.625 million was due to: a) various savings from personal services generated by the retirement of 21 NMIS employees, unused allotment for travelling expenses, training and supplies, and discontinued monitoring and evaluation activities; b) failed bidding for the construction of Marawi City Slaughterhouse under the Marawi Rehabilitation Program; and c) the Tanauan, Batangas, Meat Cutting Facility under the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act (Bayanihan II) Program. (Observation No. 2)



Of the total cash allocation of ₱782.816 million received during the year, 69 percent or ₱540.168 million was utilized/disbursed with the balance of ₱242.648 million reverted to the National Treasury due to: a) failed bidding for the construction of Marawi City Slaughterhouse and Tanauan, Batangas, Meat Cutting Plant; b) delayed finalization and signing of the MOA for the construction of Meat Cutting Plants in San Jose, Batangas, Pampanga, and Davao City;  and c) for the payment of the fabricated rendering trucks to be delivered in June 2021. Also, disbursements amounting to ₱7.500 million for the construction of Meat Cutting Plants in San Jose, Batangas under Local Meat Establishment Assistance Program, were irregular for being contrary to COA Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007. (Observation No. 3)



We recommended and Management agreed to improve its procurement planning, e.g., the conduct of effective pre-bid conferences or advance procurement activities, to ensure that there will be qualified bidders, to maximize the utilization of allotment.



2)	Cash advances for operating expenses, official foreign travels and special purpose/time-bound undertakings amounting to ₱1.984 million or 10.32 percent of the cash advances granted during the year amounting to ₱19.228 million were not liquidated contrary to Section 4 (6) of PD 1445 and COA Circular 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. Also, there were still unliquidated cash advances in prior years amounting to ₱0.293 million or 2.90 percent of the prior year’s balance of ₱10.127 million. (Observation No. 5)



We reiterated our previous recommendations and Management agreed to: 



a)	enforce strict monitoring on the grant and timely liquidation/settlement by the AOs of their cash advances within the prescribed period from the date the purpose of the cash advances is accomplished;



b)	ensure that the AOs (I and III) are sufficiently bonded from the Bureau of Treasury; 



c)	instruct the AOs (I and III) to deposit all collections promptly and intact with the AGDB; 



d)	require the AO (I) to observe the quarterly reconciliation of his cash book with the accounting records and issue OR in strict numerical sequence; 



e)	 provide the AOs (III) with properly enclosed office to guard against loss of cash or records; 



f)	direct the AOs of six (6) RTOCs concerned to submit the certified copies of their Cash Disbursement Registers with supporting paid DVs, together with other documents as proof of disbursement such as ORs, SIs, etc., within five (5) days after the end of each month for review and recording of the transactions by the Chief Accountant; 



g)	stop the practice of granting additional cash advances to AOs who failed to properly liquidate prior cash advances; 



h)	require the Accountant to reverse the recording of the liquidations without proper supporting documents to set up the liability of the AOs until such time that complete supporting documents of the liquidations are submitted to avoid audit suspension, otherwise, the transaction shall be suspended in audit; and



i)	take appropriate legal steps to collect the cash advances granted to the deceased officials and employees.



3)	Fund transfers to implementing agencies and NGOs/POs during the year for the implementation of the agency’s projects amounting to ₱106.618 million were granted and liquidated in accordance with COA Circular No. 94-013 and COA Circular 2007-001. However, fund transfers to NGAs, LGUs, and NGOs in prior years amounting to ₱80.361 million or 80.81 percent of the prior year’s balance of ₱99.448 million, remained unliquidated contrary to COA Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2007-001. Moreover, additional fund transfer amounting to ₱4.000 million under Yolanda Rehabilitation Fund was released despite non-liquidation of the previous fund transfer and a new fund transfer of ₱7.500 million to an NGO/PO without legal basis. (Observation No. 6)

	

We reiterated our previous recommendations and Management agreed to: 



a)	monitor periodically the submission of liquidation reports and immediate processing/recording of the liquidation and utilization reports; and



b)	enforce the provision of MOA by demanding the LGUs, NGAs, and NGOs to submit liquidation reports supported with complete documentation and refund the unutilized fund, if any, before releasing additional funds.



1)	Dormant unliquidated fund transfers amounting to ₱12.693 million were not requested for write-off, contrary to COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016. (Observation No. 8)



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief Accountant to conduct a thorough review and evaluation of fund transfers of over ten years and over, if warranted, request for their write-off supported with certified relevant documents, following the procedures under COA Circular No. 2016-005.



2)	Copy of 76 government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents with corresponding amount of ₱283.145 million were not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from two to 250 days as of year-end, inconsistent with Items 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009. Moreover, of the 15 contracts submitted and reviewed amounting to ₱301.297 million. (Observation No. 12)



		We recommended and Management agreed to adopt measures thru electronic means in submitting copies of the contracts and POs together with their complete supporting documents to the COA Audit Team within five working days from their execution to enable the timely review and evaluation thereof. 



3)	The agency allocated the amount of ₱11.410 million or 5.15 percent of the total appropriations of ₱221.584 million for Gender and Development (GAD) programs and activities, which complies with Section 31 of RA No. 11465 or the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020.  However, the GAD Accomplishment Report was not prepared and submitted, thus, preventing the appropriate government oversight bodies from conducting a review of the same. (Observation No. 18)



We reiterated our previous recommendations and Management agreed to require the focal person to prepare and submit the accomplishment report and provide COA, copies thereof within the prescribed period.



4)	The absence of program specific implementing guidelines in the selection process of the project beneficiary covered by the ₱299.000 million CoVid-19 Response Fund has resulted in Management’s haphazard selection of beneficiaries and transfer of funds of ₱7.500 million to a cooperative without any specific appropriation contrary to the provision of PD No. 1445, FY 2020 GAA and COA Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007. (Observation No. 26)



We recommended that Management:



a)	submit program specific guidelines used in the selection of project beneficiary where the projects are to be implemented; 



b)	provide a legal basis for the release of the CoVid-19 Fund to an NGO; and



c)	stop further release of CoVid-19 Fund until the procedures and documentary requirements under the General Provisions of GAA 2020 and COA Circular 2007-001 are complied with.



The observations and recommendations were discussed with the agency officials in an exit conference conducted on April 15, 2021. Management comments were considered in the report, where appropriate.

Notice of Disallowance (ND) issued during the year amounted to ₱0.100 million. No Notice of Suspension (NS) or Notice of Charge (NC) was issued during the year. Moreover, Notice of Settlement of Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges (NSSDC) issued during the year amounted to ₱10.218 million leaving unsettled suspensions, disallowances, and charges amounting to ₱20.842 million.
