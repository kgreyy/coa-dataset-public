PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



A)	   Financial Audit



Accounting errors and omissions



1)	An unqualified opinion was rendered on the Financial Statements due to the immediate adjustments/correction of the accounting errors and omissions amounting to ₱1,142.308 million and the unadjusted error and omission amounting to ₱3.458 million, which did not exceed the materiality level of ₱15.768 million.

	

	Section 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 provides that “Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position; financial performance, and cash flow of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSASs.”

	

Accounting errors and omissions amounting to ₱1,142.308 million were corrected by the Accountant, as shown below:

However, the financial statements showed accounting error and omission amounting to ₱0.662 million and ₱2.796 million, respectively, which did not affect the reported total Assets, Liabilities, and Net Assets/Equity amounting to ₱788.406 million, ₱147.583 million and ₱640.823 million, respectively, because it did not exceed the materiality level of ₱15.768 million, as summarized below:

In view of the of the immediate adjustments/correction of the accounting errors and omissions amounting to ₱1,142.308 million and the unadjusted error and omission amounting to ₱3.458 million, which did not exceed the materiality level of ₱15.768 million, an unqualified opinion was rendered on the Financial Statements.

	

		We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant to effect the necessary adjustments on the errors/omissions with corresponding supporting documents to correct the reported balances of the affected accounts in the Financial Statements.

	

B)		Compliance Audit with Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

	

	Low fund utilization/obligation



2)	Overall, the agency’s fund utilization/obligation of ₱637.994 is 84.88 percent compared to its allotment of ₱751.619 million, of which ₱274.093 million or 36.47 percent pertains to one of its major programs, the Local Meat Establishment Assistance Program, which registered a utilization rate of 72.20 percent and in accordance with the purpose of allotment. The unutilized fund of ₱113.625 million was due to: a) various savings from personal services generated by the retirement of 21 NMIS employees, unused allotment for travelling expenses, training and supplies, and discontinued monitoring and evaluation activities; b) failed bidding for the construction of Marawi City Slaughterhouse under the Marawi Rehabilitation Program; and c) the Tanauan, Batangas, Meat Cutting Facility under the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act (Bayanihan II) Program.



As a general rule, Departments, Bureaus and offices of the National Government, among others, shall spend what is programmed in their respective appropriations, pursuant to Section 70 of the General Provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 11465 or also known as FY 2020 General Appropriations Act (GAA).



Section 2 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 also states “It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal and improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy, and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.”



The agency’s overall fund utilization was ₱637.994 million or 84.88 percent of its total allotment of ₱751.619 million, as the table below shows:

The low fund utilization/obligation of ₱637.994 million or 84.88 percent was due to: a) various savings from personal services generated by the retirement of 21 NMIS employees, unused allotment for travelling expenses, training and supplies, and discontinued monitoring and evaluation activities; b) failed bidding for the construction of Marawi City Slaughterhouse under the Marawi Rehabilitation Program; and c) the Tanauan, Batangas, Meat Cutting Facility under the Bayanihan II Program, amounting to ₱113.625 million.

As shown above, for Local Meat Establishment Assistance Program, NMIS also registered a low utilization rate of 72.20 percent or ₱274.093 million, which is significantly lower than last year’s fund utilization rate of 90.30 percent due to the same reasons presented earlier. 



The lack of proper procurement planning is manifested by the agency action of pursuing the public bidding for the construction of Marawi City Slaughterhouse and the Tanauan, Batangas, Meat Cutting Plant despite its unpreparedness to implement the projects and, as it turned out, no bidder has qualified for the two projects which resulted in its failure to maximize the utilization of funds and has deprived the beneficiaries of the Local Meat Industry Assistance Programs. 



We recommended and Management agreed to improve its procurement planning, e.g., the conduct of effective pre-bid conferences or advance procurement activities to ensure that there will be qualified bidders, to maximize the utilization of allotment.

	

Low cash utilization/disbursements

	

3)	Of the total cash allocation of ₱782.816 million received during the year, 69 percent or ₱540.168 million was utilized/disbursed with the balance of ₱242.648 million reverted to the National Treasury due to: a) failed bidding for the construction of Marawi City Slaughterhouse and Tanauan, Batangas, Meat Cutting Plant; b) delayed finalization and signing of the MOA for the construction of Meat Cutting Plants in San Jose, Batangas, Pampanga, and Davao City;  and c) for the payment of the fabricated rendering trucks to be delivered in June 2021. Also, disbursements amounting to ₱7.500 million for the construction of Meat Cutting Plants in San Jose, Batangas under Local Meat Establishment Assistance Program, were irregular for being contrary to COA Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007. 



The details of the cash utilization/disbursements during the year are presented in the table below:

As presented above, the disbursement/utilization of ₱540.168 million or 69.00 percent of its NCA of ₱782.816 million during the year is significantly lower than last year’s utilization rate of 93.30 percent. The unutilized balance of ₱242.648 million was reverted to the National Treasury. 



The remainder of the Bayanihan II Fund was used to pay Accounts Payable and Terminal Leave Pay, as permitted under the Common Fund System, in order to maximize the use of available NCAs under NBC No. 578 dated January 6, 2020, or the Guidelines for the Release for FY 2020. Hence, this resulted in excess disbursement over NCA for Accounts Payable and Terminal Leave amounting to ₱48.589 million and ₱8.905 million, respectively.

Records disclosed that the funds for the Marawi Rehabilitation and Bayanihan II programs were released by the Department of Budget and Management as early as July and October 2020, respectively. However, the Marawi City Slaughterhouse and Tanauan Meat Cutting Plant (MCP) public biddings were not successful due to the failure of the bidders to submit documentary requirements, hence, the funds lapsed and were reverted to the National Treasury. 



On the other hand, for the Tanauan, Pampanga, and Malagos, Davao City, Slaughterhouses, the Memorandum of Agreements (MOAs) were finalized and signed while the remaining funds also lapsed and were reverted. Moreover, the funds for the delivery of the two rendering trucks also lapsed and reverted by year-end since the scheduled delivery is in June 2021. The lack of proper procurement planning on the part of the Management resulted in not being able to maximize the NCA released to the agency. 



The delayed finalization of the MOA for Bayanihan II projects resulted in the agency’s failure to maximize the utilization of funds and deprived the government of more efficient management of financial resources. The fund transfer of ₱7.500 million to a Non-Government Organization/ People’s Organization (NGO/PO) was irregular for being violative of COA Circular No. 2007-001. This is discussed in Observation No. 26 of this Report.



We recommended and Management agreed to improve its procurement planning, e.g., the conduct of effective pre-bid conferences or advance procurement activities, to ensure that there will be qualified bidders, to maximize the utilization of cash received.



Reversion of dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, and unnecessary fund



4)	NMIS has no dormant cash, unauthorized accounts, unnecessary special and trust funds, and other related accounts for reversion as of year-end, in conformity with Permanent Committee Joint Circular No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012, implementing Executive Order No. 431 dated May 30, 2005.



Non-liquidation of cash advances and grant of additional cash advances without proper liquidation of previous amounts granted



5)	Cash advances for operating expenses, official foreign travels and special purpose/time-bound undertakings amounting to ₱1.984 million or 10.32 percent of the cash advances granted during the year amounting to ₱19.228 million were not liquidated in contrary to Section 4 (6) of PD 1445 and COA Circular 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. Also, there were still unliquidated cash advances in prior years amounting to ₱0.293 million or 2.90 percent of the prior year’s balance of ₱10.127 million. 



Section 4 (6) of PD 1445 provides that “claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.



Moreover, COA Circular Nos. 97-002 and 2009-002 provide that:



--	The following shall be submitted together with the Report of Disbursements, among others, bills, receipts and invoices, and other pertinent documents as required by the nature of the expenses within the prescribed period as follows:



	--	Official Travel – within sixty (60) days after the return to the Philippines in the case of foreign travel or within thirty (30) days after the return to his permanent official station in the case of local travel.



	--	Special Purpose Time-bound Undertaking – within one month from the date the purpose of the cash advance was accomplished.



--	No additional cash advances shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him/her is first settled or proper accounting thereof is made.



--	A cash advance shall be reported on as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served.



--	All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year. Except for the petty cash fund, the Accountable Officer (AO) shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary receipt.



During the year, cash advances amounting to ₱19.228 million were granted, of which 89.68 percent or ₱17.244 million were liquidated, leaving a balance of ₱1.984 million as of year-end. On the other hand, of the outstanding cash advances in prior years amounting to ₱10.127 million, ₱97.10 percent or ₱9.833 million were liquidated, leaving a balance is ₱0.293 million, thus, resulting in the accumulation of outstanding cash advances of ₱2.227 million as of December 31, 2020, shown as follows:

For operating expenses cash advances, out of the PY balance of ₱4.066 million, ₱3.638 million were liquidated during the year, including ₱0.203 million which were erroneously recorded under Special purpose/time-bound undertakings.



The prior year’s balance of ₱0.069 million for official foreign travels refers to the cash advances of ₱0.028 million of two (2) NMIS Personnel who traveled to Chile in 2019 and cash advance of ₱0.041 million granted to a BAI personnel who was not able to liquidate upon his return and who eventually died in CY 2015.



Moreover, deficiencies/weaknesses in cash management were observed in NMIS Regional Technical Operation Centers (RTOCs) I, III, V, VII, VIII, IX and XIII due to non-compliance with rules and regulations on granting, utilizing, handling, and recording of cash advances and cash collections as shown in the table below:

Sec. 4 (6) of PD 1445



Granting of additional cash advances amounting to ₱2.089 million despite improper liquidation of prior Cash advances.

Sec. 14I, Vol. I, GAM



The management’s complacency in monitoring the cash advances and allowing the grant of additional cash advances before the submission of proper liquidation reports of previous amounts released to the AOs and its failure to immediately act on the delayed submission of liquidation reports contributed to the accumulation of balances as of year-end, thus, exposing government funds to the risk of possible loss/misapplication 



We reiterated our previous recommendations and Management agreed to: 



a)	enforce strict monitoring on the grant and timely liquidation/settlement by the AOs of their cash advances within the prescribed period from the date the purpose of the cash advances is accomplished;



b)	ensure that the AOs (I and III) are sufficiently bonded from the Bureau of Treasury; 



c)	instruct the AOs (I and III) to deposit all collections promptly and intact with the AGDB; 



d)	require the AO (I) to observe the quarterly reconciliation of his cash book with the accounting records and issue OR in strict numerical sequence; 



e)	 provide the AOs (III) with properly enclosed office to guard against loss of cash or records; 



f)	direct the AOs of six (6) RTOCs concerned to submit the certified copies of their Cash Disbursement Registers with supporting paid DVs, together with other documents as proof of disbursement such as ORs, SIs, etc., within five (5) days after the end of each month for review and recording of the transactions by the Chief Accountant; 



g)	stop the practice of granting additional cash advances to AOs who failed to properly liquidate prior cash advances; 



h)	require the Accountant to reverse the recording of the liquidations without proper supporting documents to set up the liability of the AOs until such time that complete supporting documents of the liquidations are submitted to avoid audit suspension, otherwise,  the transaction shall be suspended in audit; and



i)	take appropriate legal steps to collect the cash advances granted to the deceased officials and employees.



Non-liquidation of fund transfers to implementing agencies and NGOs/POs



6)	Fund transfers to implementing agencies and NGOs/POs during the year for the implementation of the agency’s projects amounting to ₱106.618 million were granted and liquidated in accordance with COA Circular No. 94-013 and COA Circular 2007-001. However, fund transfers to NGAs, LGUs, and NGOs in prior years amounting to ₱80.361 million or 80.81 percent of the prior year’s balance of ₱99.448 million, remained unliquidated contrary to COA Circular Nos. 94-013 and 2007-001. Moreover, additional fund transfer amounting to ₱4.000 million under Yolanda Rehabilitation Fund was released despite non-liquidation of the previous fund transfer and a new fund transfer of ₱7.500 million to an NGO/PO without legal basis.

	

	COA Circular No. 94-013, dated December 13, 1994, provides that the Source Agency (SA) shall maintain a subsidiary ledger of the cash transferred pertaining to the project and require the Implementing Agency (IA) to submit reports and furnish the IA with a copy of the journal voucher taking up the expenditures. On the other hand, the IA shall submit to the SA the Report of Checks Issued (RCI) within ten (10) days after the end of each month/end of the agreed period for the Project, and the Report of Disbursement (RD) to report the utilization of the funds; and that the fund to be transferred shall be replenished only upon submission of the reports of disbursements by the IA.

	

	COA Circular No. 2007-001, dated October 25, 2007, provides that the Government Organization (GO) shall keep and maintain financial and accounting records of fund granted to Non-Government Organization/ People’s Organization (NGO/PO) and the signing officials of the GO to the MOA shall cause close monitoring and inspection of project implementation and verification of the financial records and reports of the NGO/PO, and shall ensure compliance with the provisions of the MOA and the herein cited circular. On the other hand, the NGO shall submit the final Fund Utilization Report together with the supporting documents to the GO within 60 days after the completion of the project,

	

	As of December 31, 2020, the balance of fund transfers to Local Government Units (LGUs), National Government Agencies (NGAs), and NGOs/POs for the construction and repairs of slaughterhouses amounted to ₱186.828 million, details shown in the table below:

	During the year, funds amounting to ₱106.618 million were transferred to LGUs amounting to ₱53.399, to NGAs amounting to ₱45.719, and to one NGO/PO amounting to ₱7.500, of which ₱97.500 million were made only in December 2020 for the implementation of the Bayanihan II Projects with target completion set on June 30, 2021. 

	

	However, prior years’ fund transfers to LGUs and NGOs/POs amounting to ₱80.361 million remained unliquidated as of year-end. Some of these fund transfers were made as early as CY 1997 which certainly means that these projects have long been completed and the liquidation reports should have been submitted from the completion of the projects. Moreover, the MOA signed by these LGUs also state that liquidation reports should be submitted 30 days from the receipt of the fund. 

	

	Demand letters were sent to concerned LGUs/NGOs in CY 2020, thru RTOC Directors. Several LGUs have submitted their liquidation and utilization reports, however, these were received only in the first quarter of CY 2021, hence, not yet reflected in the books as of year-end. The Accountant further stated that other IAs and NGOs/POs failed to reply/comply with the demand letters. The Management informed that some LGUs are citing the lack of proper turnover from the previous administrations as the cause of delay in submitting the liquidation reports. Still, others whose records were destroyed by the typhoon, like in the case of LGUs in Region VIII, were devastated by Typhoon Yolanda in 2012.

	

	Moreover, records disclosed that additional (second tranche) funds amounting to ₱4.000 million was released to the Municipality of Kananga, Leyte, which failed to submit fund utilization and accomplishment reports of the first tranche amounting to ₱6.000 million released in October 2019.

	

	The accumulation of unliquidated prior year fund transfers is attributed to the failure of Management to monitor the status and disposition of the outstanding balances despite the lapse of time caused by its failure to enforce the provision of its MOA and the above mentioned COA Circular. This laxity of the Management also resulted in granting additional fund transfer even without the liquidation of the previous fund transfer contrary to the above-cited circular.

	

	We reiterated our previous recommendations and Management agreed to:

	

a)		monitor periodically the submission of liquidation reports and the immediate processing/recording of the liquidation and utilization reports; and

	

b)		enforce the provision of MOA by demanding the LGUs, NGAs, and NGOs to submit liquidation reports supported with complete documentation and refund the unutilized fund, if any, before releasing additional funds.

	

Granting and liquidation of fund transfers to PS-DBM



7)	During the year, fund transfers to Procurement Service – Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) for its common office supplies requirement amounting to ₱0.719 million were made, of which, ₱0.151 million were liquidated in accordance with COA Circular No. 94-013, leaving a balance of ₱0.568 million at year end. There were no unliquidated fund transfers in prior years.



	Dormant receivables not requested for write-off

	

8)	Dormant unliquidated fund transfers amounting to ₱12.693 million were not requested for write-off, contrary to COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.

	

	COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016, provides the Guidelines and Procedures on the Write-off of Dormant Receivables account, Unliquidated Cash Advances and Fund Transfers of National Government Agencies (NGAs), Local Government Units (LGUs), and Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs).  It provides, among others, that “all government agencies shall conduct regular monitoring and analysis/reconciliation of receivables accounts, x x x”.	

	

	Section 5.6 of the COA Circular No. 2016-005 defines Dormant Unliquidated Fund Transfers (FTs) as “advances granted by the source entity to implementing entity for the implementation of programs/projects which remained inactive or non-moving in the books of accounts for ten (10) years or more and where settlement could no longer be ascertained.”

	

	Section 8.2 of the same Circular requires the Head of the government entity to file the request for authority to write-off dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances, and fund transfers to the COA Audit Team Leader (ATL) and/or Supervising Auditor (SA).

	

	Records disclosed that out of the prior year’s unliquidated fund transfers of ₱80.361 million as of year-end, ₱12.693 million have been dormant for ten years and over, consisting of accounts of 28 LGUs amounting to ₱11.925 million and one NGO/PO amounting to ₱0.768 million.

	

	The existence of dormant accounts for ten years or more indicates the Management’s failure to properly review and evaluate the dormant accounts of fund transfer to LGUs and NGOs/POs. The likelihood of collection of the accounts is already remote, however, the request for write-off was not filed by the Management. Management informed that they are cleaning up their records of the fund transfers to LGUs/NGOs, and that they will request for write-off the long outstanding receivables by CY 2021, as may be necessary.



We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Chief Accountant to conduct a thorough review and evaluation of fund transfers of ten years and over, if warranted, request for their write-off supported with certified relevant documents, following the procedures under COA Circular No. 2016-005.



Insurance of physical assets with the GSIS



9)	The agency insured with the GSIS property amounting to ₱734.458 million with corresponding insurance premiums paid in the amount of ₱4.602 million, in accordance with RA No. 656, otherwise known as the “Property Insurance Law”, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 245 dated July 13, 1973.



Non-disposal of unserviceable property



10)		Unserviceable property of NMIS RTOCs V, VI and VIII with a book value of ₱3.706 million were not yet disposed of as of December 31, 2020, thus, exposing said assets to further deterioration and depriving the government of additional income from the sale thereof and space for its use. 

	

		Section 79 of PD No. 1445, states, among others, that:

		

		        When government property has become unserviceable for any cause, or no longer needed, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefore, be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or unsalable, it may be destroyed in their presence. If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder under the supervision of the proper committee on award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other duly authorized representative of the Commission, after advertising by printed notice in the Official Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive days in any newspaper of general circulation, or where the value of the property does not warrant the expense of publication, by notices posted for a like period in at least three public places in the locality where the property is to be sold. In the event that the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned.

		

	Section 40 (d), Vol. I of the GAM for NGAs provides that:

	

	All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74). PPE reported in the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated Depreciation).

	

	While the Central Office has disposed of an unserviceable motor vehicle amounting to ₱0.024 million, in compliance with Section 79 of P.D. No. 1445, Regional Technical Operating Centers (RTOCs) Nos. V, VI and VIII have several unserviceable properties with a book value of ₱3.706 million which remained undisposed as of year-end, as shown in the table below:

	The 27 units of PPE amounting to ₱3.706 million, which were found to be unserviceable during the physical count were included in the list of serviceable PPE for inventory. The lack of coordination among the Property Officers, the Inventory Committee, and the Disposal Committee has caused the failure of the property officers to timely prepare the IIRUP of unserviceable PPEs.

	



The non-disposal of unserviceable property exposes such assets to further deterioration and loss of their value, thus, depriving the government of the additional income that could have been derived from the disposal thereof. Likewise, the space occupied by these assets could have been utilized for more productive purposes.

	

	We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the concerned Property Officers of RTOCs V, VI and VIII to prepare the corresponding IIRUP for all items identified as unserviceable and coordinate with the Inventory and Disposal Committees.

	

Procurement of goods and services, consultancy, and infrastructure projects



11)	This year’s procured goods and services through public bidding and negotiated procurement amounting to ₱59.105 million and ₱7.455 million, respectively, were included in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP) and the creation of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) and the conduct of the opening of bids are found to be in order in accordance with Section 53.1 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulation (IRR) of RA No. 9184 (Procurement Law).



Delayed/Non- submission of government contracts and purchase orders

	

12)	Copy of 76 government contracts, purchase orders and their supporting documents with corresponding amount of ₱283.145 million were not submitted within the prescribed period, with delays ranging from two to 250 days as of year-end, inconsistent with Items 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009. Moreover, of the 15 contracts submitted and reviewed amounting to ₱301.297 million.



Item 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, provides that:



       “Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of the said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.” 



Item 3.2.1 of the same Circular states that: 



       A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and every supporting document, shall within five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned… x x x. 



During the year, out of 109 contracts and POs amounting to ₱374.935 million, 76 contracts and POs amounting to ₱283.145 million were belatedly submitted to COA, including the three (3) MOAs for the Bayanihan II Projects amounting to ₱230.000 million, with delays ranging from two to 250 days, contrary to COA Circular 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009, as shown in table below:

	Compared to last year, there was a significant increase in the delayed submission of contracts by the Management to the COA Audit Team, both in terms of the number of contracts and the absolute amounts. 

	

	The delayed submission is caused by the difficulty in releasing approved copies of the contracts and POs to the suppliers and providing COA copies thereof given the different work schedules of employees per the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Infectious Diseases guidelines, as approved. 

	

The delayed submission of contracts and POs and the supporting documents caused the delay in the auditorial review of the transactions, thus, defects, if any, could not be promptly communicated to Management for immediate action.

	

	We recommended and Management agreed to adopt measures thru electronic means in submitting copies of the contracts and POs together with their complete supporting documents to the COA Audit Team within five working days from their execution to enable the timely review and evaluation thereof. 

	

	Withholding and remittances of GSIS contributions, loans, and employer’s share

	

13)	The GSIS personal share and loans of employees amounting to ₱12.772 million and ₱11.008 million, respectively, were deducted properly and remitted without delay, in accordance with RA No. 8291, the GSIS Act of 1997.  Likewise, the employer’s share amounting to ₱3.832 million was remitted without delay.



	Withholding and remittances of PhilHealth contributions and employer’s share

Hiring of and payments to job orders and contractual personnel

			

4)		A total of 115 individuals covered with Contract of Service (COS) or Job Order (JO) as of December 31, 2020 were hired on a semestral basis, in accordance with CSC COA DBM Joint Circular No. 1 dated June 15, 2017, as updated by CSC COA DBM Joint Circular No. 2, s 2020, dated October 20, 2020, to augment the regular plantilla employees of 310, due to inadequate administrative and technical personnel needed in the implementation of its programs and projects. Their salaries were charged against Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) in the total amount of ₱23.606 million, as authorized under DBM Circular Letter (CL) No. 2013-5 dated July 22, 2013.



Non-submission of GAD accomplishment report



1)	The agency allocated the amount of ₱11.410 million or 5.15 percent of the total appropriations of ₱221.584 million for Gender and Development (GAD) programs and activities, which complies with Section 31 of RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020.  However, the GAD Accomplishment Report was not prepared and submitted, thus, preventing the appropriate government oversight bodies from conducting a review of the same.



Section 31 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11645 or the GAA for FY 2020 provides that the GAD Plan shall be integrated into the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets. For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies that relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. The utilization of the GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.



Section 37 of Rule VI of RA No. 9710 MCW-IRR provides that the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) shall review the GPB accompanied by GAD AR submitted annually by the NGAs, bureaus, SUCs, GOCCs, and other government instrumentalities for gender-responsiveness. The PCW shall then return the endorsed GAD Plans and Programs to the concerned agencies for submission to the DBM. 



Section 1.0 of the PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 2021 provides that March 12, 2021 is the deadline of encoding and submission to PCW of FY 2020 GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) of executive departments and their attached agencies through Gender Mainstreaming and Monitoring System (GMMS). Moreover, Section 7.0 of the same circular further states that “FY 2020 GAD ARs submitted to PCW shall be authenticated by the GMMS with a barcode. Concerned agencies shall print the GMMS-authenticated GAD AR for signature of their agency head and submit signed copies to PCW and their respective COA Audit Team”. 



The Management allocated ₱11.410 million or 5.15 percent which is more than five (5) percent of its CY 2020 Appropriation for GAD programs and activities in accordance with Section 31 of RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020. Also, the Management showed that the GPB has been endorsed by the PCW with its submission through online to PCW’s Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS). However, the amount and percentage of utilization were not determined due to non-preparation and submission of the GAD Accomplishment Report to the audit team.



The focal person informed that they are still preparing the Accomplishment Reports for CY 2020 for submission to PCW by April 2021. Initially, she informed that most of the activities as planned did not materialize due to the limitations brought by the COVID-19 Pandemic. These activities include training and seminars which were restricted during the various community quarantine declaration during the year.



We reiterated our previous recommendations and Management agreed to require the focal person to prepare and submit the accomplishment report and provide COA, copies thereof within the prescribed period.



Non-preparation of SCPD plan 



2)	The agency did not formulate plans, programs, and projects for the Senior Citizen and Person with Disability (SCPD), contrary to Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020. 



		Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for 2020 provides that, for Programs and Projects Related to Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability, all agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs, and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.

	

Management informed that the SCPD Plan for CY 2020 was not prepared because the focal person was appointed only in July 2020 resulting in non-allocation of the budget thereof. These programs and projects are intended to address the concerns and issues of senior citizens and differently-abled persons; hence, this sector did not benefit from the programs and projects required by said law for the improvement of their total well-being.

	

We reiterated our previous recommendations and Management agreed to formulate plans and programs for SCPD, in accordance with Section 32 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020, and prepare and submit the corresponding accomplishment report to the Audit Team for evaluation.



Receipt and disbursement of ODA and DRRM Fund



3)	The agency did not receive and disburse Official Development Assistance (ODA) and Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) funds for this year.



Receipt and disbursement of PDAF and DAP Fund

	

4)	The agency did not receive and disburse Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) and Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) fund for this year in compliance with Supreme Court Decision G.R. Nos. 208566 and 209287, respectively.



Audit suspensions, disallowances, charges, and settlements



5)	A Notice of Disallowance (ND) amounting to ₱0.100 million was issued during the year due to non-compliance with COA Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 29, 2012. Moreover, only ₱10.218 million were settled on prior years’ audit suspensions and disallowances during the year, leaving an unsettled suspension and disallowances of ₱20.842 million as of year-end. However, settlement thru installment of disallowances was allowed by the management even without approval from COA LSS, resulting in a long outstanding balance of employees’ accounts.



COA Circular No. 2009-006 or the Revised Rules of Settlement of Accounts dated September 15, 2009, provides, among others, that:



Section 9.1.	The Auditor shall issue a Notice of Suspension (NS) for transactions of doubtful legality/propriety/regularity which may result in pecuniary loss of the government, and which will be disallowed in audit if not satisfactorily explained or validly justified by the parties concerned.



Section 10.1.	The Auditor shall issue a Notice of Disallowance (ND) for transactions which are irregular/unnecessary/excessive and extravagant as defined in the COA Circular No. 85-55A as well as other COA issuances, and those which are illegal and unconscionable.



Section 13.1.	The Auditor shall issue the Notice of Settlement of Suspension/ Disallowance/Charge (NSSDC) whenever a suspension/ disallowance or charge is settled.

	

Section 7.1.1 of the same Circular also requires the head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and properties pertaining to his agency, to ensure that the settlement of disallowances and charges is made within the prescribed period and the requirements of transactions suspended in audit are complied with.



COA Resolution No. 2015-031, as amended by COA Resolution No 2017-021, provides that: 



All requests for installment payment shall be submitted to and reviewed by the Prosecution and Litigation Office (PLO), Legal Services Sector (LSS), through the concerned Auditors and Cluster/Regional Directors, with an appropriate comment, recommendation, proposed installment schedule, and supporting documents. xxx.



Only disallowed salaries, personnel benefits, allowances, or emoluments classified under the expenditure item of Personal Services (PS) shall be allowed to be settled by installment payment xxx.

	

For persons liable who are already separated from the service for whatever reason upon finality of the COA Decision or Notice of Disallowance, or upon issuance of Notice of Finality of Decision or COA Order of Execution, their liability should be paid in full to the agency cashier. 

	

The total audit suspensions, disallowances, and charges as of December 31, 2020, as well as the settlement during the year, is summarized in the table below:

During the year, notice of disallowance on the honorarium of four (4) lawyers from the Department of Agriculture (DA)-Legal Service Division amounting to ₱0.100 million was issued under ND-20-001-101(2019) dated June 30, 2020, and is under appeal with the Commission on Audit.



Out of the prior year’s unsettled suspensions of ₱3.633 million, ₱2.408 million or 66.28 percent were settled through submission of required documents, leaving a balance of ₱1.225 million which has also matured, thus, NDs were issued in March 2021.

	

	Of the beginning balance of the audit disallowances of ₱27.327 million pertaining to disallowed honorarium and cash incentives paid without legal basis, only ₱7.810 million were settled through installment basis with some paying ₱1,000.00 per month through salary deduction while others voluntarily pay any amounts. It should be pointed out that the installment payment was allowed by Management even without authority from the PLO, LSS of the COA resulting in the accumulation of disallowances that should have been settled earlier had the whole amount collected or the schedule of installment as provided under the COA Circular No. 27-001 was followed. Out of 37 persons liable for paying thru installment, only 12 have requested and were approved to pay on an installment basis.

In compliance with the prior year’s audit recommendation, the Management has sent demand letters to retired NMIS personnel who were named as persons liable for the outstanding disallowances. As a result, three (3) employees have settled a total amount of ₱0.175 million. The ending balance of unsettled disallowances amounting to ₱19.617 million includes the unsettled balance of ₱0.200 million of four (4) remaining resigned NMIS personnel who has yet to comply with the demand letters.

	

While there was partial compliance with the prior year’s recommendation for the submission of the request for installments, we find that the management has been lenient in the collection/refund of disallowances as well as settlement of suspension, hence, resulted in the accumulation of long outstanding disallowances.



We reiterated our previous recommendations and Management agreed to:



a)	require the officials and employees responsible and liable to immediately settle/refund the audit suspensions and disallowances within the prescribed period;



b)	request an authority from PLO, LSS-COA to settle the disallowances by installment and apply the guidelines stated in the COA Resolution, otherwise, collect in full the amount of the disallowances;



c)	require the cashier to suspend the payment of salaries of all persons liable until full settlement of disallowances was made; and



d)	make appropriate steps to ensure the settlement of final and executory audit disallowances, such as collection from other persons liable who are jointly and severally liable for the subject disallowances.







C)	Compliance Audit of CoVid-19 Funds during the Period of State of National Emergency



	Receipt, utilization, and disbursement of funds

	

6)	NMIS registered a low fund utilization rate of 83.32 percent or ₱249.970 million out of ₱300.000 million and a low cash utilization of 32.50 percent or ₱97.500 million for the construction of Meat Cutting Plants in San Jose, Batangas under Local Meat Establishment Assistance Programs under the Bayanihan II Law, thus, resulted in depriving the beneficiaries of the Local Meat Establishment Assistance Programs.



Section 10 (f) of the Bayanihan Law II appropriated ₱24.000 billion to provide cash or loan interest rate subsidies, under the programs of the Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Credit Policy Council (DA-ACPC) and other forms of assistance to qualified agri-fishery enterprises, farmers and fisherfolk registered under the Registry System for Basic Sectors in Agriculture (RSBSA), and agriculture cooperatives, to finance the Plant, Plant, Plant Program to ensure food security and continuous productivity in the agricultural sector including accessibility through farm to market roads.



As a general rule, Departments, Bureaus and offices of the National Government including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy and SUCs shall spend what is programmed in their respective appropriations pursuant to Section 70 of the General Provisions of RA No. 11465 or also known as 2020 GAA.



Section 2 of PD No. 1445 also states that “It is the declared policy of the State that all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal and improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy, and effectiveness in the operations of government. The responsibility to take care such policy is faithfully adhered to rests directly with the chief or head of the government agency concerned.”

The low fund utilization/obligation of ₱249.970 million or 83.32 percent was due to failed bidding for the construction for the Tanauan, Batangas, Meat Cutting Facility under the Bayanihan II Program amounting to ₱50.000 million and savings from the procurement of fabricated rendering truck amounting to ₱0.030 million.



As mentioned in Observation No. 2, the lack of proper procurement planning resulted in its failure to maximize the utilization of funds and has deprived the beneficiaries of the Local Meat Establishment Assistance Programs.



The realigned regular fund was fully utilized.



We recommended and Management agreed to improve its procurement planning and management to ensure that there will be qualified bidders, to maximize the utilization of allotments and funds.



	Procurement of Medical Supplies and Services and Van Rental



7)	The procurement of motor vehicle, medical supplies, and services, the lease of service van of the NMIS is in compliance, in all material respect, with Section 53.2 of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulation (IRR) of RA No. 9184 (Procurement Law) and GPPB Resolution No. 2020-001, from Preparation of Project Requirements to Award of Contract.

Fund transfers to Implementing Agencies (IAs) and NGOs/POs

	

9)	The absence of program specific implementing guidelines in the selection process of the project beneficiary covered by the ₱299.000 million CoVid-19 Response Fund has resulted in Management’s haphazard selection of beneficiaries and transfer of funds of ₱7.500 million to a cooperative without any specific appropriation, contrary to the provisions of the PD No. 1445, FY 2020 GAA and COA Circular No. 2007-001 dated October 25, 2007.



RA No. 11494, also known as Bayanihan to Recover as One Act took effect on September 11, 2020, providing for  CoVid-19 response and recovery interventions and providing mechanisms to accelerate the recovery and bolster the resiliency of the Philippine Economy, providing funds therefor, and for other purposes. Said act granted the President power and authorities necessary to carry out urgent measures to meet the CoVid-19 National Health Emergency to supplement, expand, improve, and intensify existing CoVid-19 responses and recovery measures, and to further mitigate the social, economic, and financial impact to CoVid-19 on all Filipinos.

			Out of the total CoVid-19 funds of ₱299.000 million, ₱201.500 million remained unutilized and were reverted to the Bureau of Treasury at the end of CY 2020. As shown in the table above, NMIS entered into a MOA with SJWMPC for a ₱50.000 million project for the Construction of MCP under the Bayanihan II Program and released ₱7.500 million despite the lack of legal and technical requirements of SJWMPC, contrary to COA Circular No. 2007-001.

			

			The absence of program specific implementing guidelines in the implementation of the Bayanihan II projects resulted in the haphazard selection of beneficiaries even without the required, among others, study, work plan, and legal and technical documents as required under COA Circular No. 2007-001 before the release of the fund to the concerned NGO/PO. 

			

			The Management disclosed that the LGU beneficiaries was preselected by the Department of Agriculture-Central Office (DA-CO). However, there is no memorandum, minutes of the Committee or Task Force meetings for the CoVid-19 Response initiatives, or any other documentation that would explain or justify the chosen beneficiaries. 

			

			The grant of the fund to an NGO to implement the projects should have been evaluated and selected in compliance with the provisions of COA Circular No. 2007-001 or an open and competitive public bidding was conducted as required in 2020 GAA. In this case, the COA audit team was made aware of the reason for the selection of LGUs for the Bayanihan II projects only after the release of the fund to the beneficiaries.

			

			This action of the agency has exposed the government to the risk of possible misappropriation or loss of funds.

			

			We recommended and Management agreed to:



a)	submit program specific guidelines used in the selection of project beneficiary where the projects are to be implemented; 



b)	provide a legal basis for the release of the CoVid-19 Fund to an NGO; and



c)	stop further release of CoVid-19 Fund until the procedures and documentary requirements under the General Provisions of GAA 2020 and COA Circular No. 2007-001 are complied with.



The Management has complied with the required documentation and submitted the implementing guidelines----footnote7---- on April 19, 2021. The Management should ensure that prior to the release of the fund, the required documentations under COA Circular 2007-001 and other enabling laws are complied with to protect the government interest in relation to the released fund. 



Grant of Hazard Pay and Allowances 



10)	The grant of hazard pay and allowances to NMIS regular and contractual employees who reported for work during the ECQ period is in compliance, in all material respect, with CSC Memorandum Nos. 10 and 18, Administrative Order No. 26 dated March 23, 2020, and Budget Circular No. 2020-1 dated March 24, 2020.
