EXECUTIVE SUMMARY





A)	Introduction



The Palompon Institute of Technology (PIT) was originally known as the Palompon School of Arts and Trades (PSAT) in 1964 by virtue of Republic Act (RA) No. 3394.  With the enactment of RA No. 5101 in 1967, PSAT was converted to PIT.  The integration of Commission on Higher Education (CHED) - Supervised Institutions (CSIs) to State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) in 1999, Marcelino R. Veloso National Polytechnic College (MRVNPC) in Tabango, Leyte, was formally integrated into PIT and became the PIT-Tabango Campus.  PIT was converted to a state university to be named as the Palompon Polytechnic State University (PPSU) with the passage of House Bill No. 4461 through RA No. 10599 in June 2013.  However, the Institute is precluded from using the PPSU pending compliance with the prerequisite conditions outlined by the CHED for university-hood.



The audit of PIT covered the review of the accounts and operations for calendar year 2020.  The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of reliance that may be placed on management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; c) recommend agency improvement opportunities; and d) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.

C)	Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



The Auditor rendered a clean opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of PIT for the CY 2020.





D)	Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations



The following are the significant audit observations and recommendations which are discussed in detail in Part II of this Report:



1)	The Accounts Receivable which is reported at P19,695,529.74 has variances between its General Ledger (GL) balance and the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) balance totaling P4,029,027.27 for Internally Generated Funds (FC-05) and P43,823.22 for Business Related Funds (FC-06), thereby affecting the fair presentation of the account in the Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020; (Observation No. 1)



We recommended that the President require the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) for Finance to reconcile the discrepancies reported in the GLs, the SLs, and the Aging of Accounts Receivable balances under the books of FC-05 and FC-06; and to maintain SLs for each individual debtor so that reconciliation is more efficient.



2)	The profit sharing for the Income Generating Projects (IGPs) for CY 2020 was not in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the Manual of Operations for IGPs of State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) in Region 8, resulting in the understatement of the Due to Officers and Employees account in the amount of P20,529.10, and overstatement of Due to Other Funds in the amount of P11,405.06; (Observation No. 2)



We recommended that the President require the CAO for Finance/IGP BOM Chairperson to:

	

a)		instruct the personnel in charge to prepare the IGP Profit Sharing Scheme in conformity with the guidelines of the Manual of Operations for IGPs of SUCs in Region 8; and

	

b)		draw the Journal Entry Vouchers (JEV) to effect the necessary adjusting entries to correct the affected accounts as follows:

	

	Account Title

	Debit

	Credit

	Due to Other Funds

	P11,405.06

	

	Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit)

	9,124.04

	

Due to Officers & Employees

	

	P20,529.10

	





3)	The complete set of ledgers and financial statements of each IGP was not prepared, contrary to Chapter VII of the Manual of Operations for IGPs of SUCs in Region 8; (Observation No. 3)

	

We recommended that the President require the IGP Facilitative Staff to prepare the complete ledgers and financial statements of each IGP as prescribed in Chapter VII of the Manual of Operations for IGPs of SUCs in Region 8.



4)	The dates of receipt for goods procured amounting to P4,637,845.25 were not indicated in the Supplier’s Invoice/Delivery Receipt, contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001, thus resulting in the difficulty of computing for liquidated damages, as required under Item 3 of Annex D of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of RA No. 9184.  Moreover, the inspection and acceptance for partially delivered goods were held in abeyance pending the complete delivery of the items; (Observation No. 4)

	

We recommended that the President require the Supply Officer to indicate the correct dates of receipt in the “Received” portion of the Supplier’s Invoice/Delivery Receipt as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2012-001, to determine whether the goods were promptly delivered, and to impose liquidated damages for late deliveries.



5)	The Petty Cash Fund Custodian (PCFC) does not maintain the Petty Cash Fund Record (PCFRec) prescribed in Section 37, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, and Appendix 50 of Volume II of the same Manual, thereby causing difficulty in determining the cash accountability of the accountable officer as of year end; and (Observation No. 5)

	

We recommended that the President require the Petty Cash Fund Custodian to prepare and maintain the PCFRec as prescribed by the GAM for NGAs, Volume II, to facilitate the determination of the latter’s cash accountability and the correctness of such balance at a given period.

	

6)	The CY 2020 GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) submitted through the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) was not properly accomplished, and its supporting documents were not submitted to the Audit Team, contrary to pertinent provisions of Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01 issued by PCW, National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) and Department of Budget and Management (DBM); and PCW Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2021-01. (Observation No. 6)

	

We recommended that the President require the GAD Focal Point System in charge to properly accomplish the GAD AR being submitted through the PCW GMMS, and to submit to the Audit Team the supporting documents together with the GAD AR, pursuant to PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 and PCW MC No. 2021-01.

	

	The above audit observations and recommendations were communicated to Management through Audit Observation Memoranda (AOM), and their comments are incorporated in the report, where appropriate.

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





Financial and Compliance





Variances in balances between GL, SL, Schedule and Aging of Accounts Receivables



1)		The Accounts Receivable which is reported at P19,695,529.74 has variances between its General Ledger (GL) balance and the Subsidiary Ledger (SL) balance totaling P4,029,027.27 for Internally Generated Funds (FC-05) and P43,823.22 for Business Related Funds (FC-06), thereby affecting the fair presentation of the account in the Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020.



	1)		The pertinent provisions of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, are as follows:



SECTION 111. Keeping of accounts. - (1) The accounts of an agency shall be kept in such detail as is necessary to meet the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control agencies of the government.



(2) The highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or misleading information.



SECTION 112. Recording of financial transactions. - Each government agency shall record its financial transactions and operations conformably with generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations.



	2)		Likewise, Section 6 of Chapter 19 of Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for NGAs, Volume I, provides:



Sec. 6. Qualitative Characteristics of Financial Reporting.  An entity shall present information including accounting policies in a manner that meets the following qualitative characteristics enumerated in PPSAS 1:



e.	Reliability – reliable information is free from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent.



f.	Faithful representation – information to represent faithfully transactions and other events, it should be presented in accordance with the substance of the transactions and other events, and not merely their legal form.



	3)		The Statement of Financial Position reported their Accounts Receivable year-end balances of P17,599,021.89 (FC-05) and P2,096,507.85 (FC-06); while the SL balances were reported at P13,569,994.62 (FC-05) and P2,052,684.63 (FC-06), as shown in the table below:

	4)		Our review of FC-05 Accounts Receivable disclosed that SLs were not maintained for each person or establishment indebted to the Institute.  Several accounts were instead classified and recorded under one SL.  For example, instead of maintaining a separate SL for each student, Senior High students were grouped and classified under one SL labeled as DepEd.



	5)		The same practice was also noted for the FC-06 accounts: other SLs were even more complicated since the labelling of the SL was for the account of items sold, and not to whom the items were sold on account.  Different account names were also used in the Schedule and Aging of Accounts Receivable under FC-06.



	6)		The table below shows the account names indicated in the SLs and the Schedule and Aging of Accounts Receivable for both FC-05 and FC-06:

	7)		Our further examination of the accounts revealed several discrepancies between the generated reports for the GL, the combined balance of the SL, and the Aging of Accounts Receivable for the period under audit.



	8)		The Accounting personnel in charge of maintaining the books of FC-05 claimed that although the SL combined balance does not equal the GL balance as at year end, the sum total of the supporting schedules, billing statements and other documents matches the GL balance, to wit:

	9)		Based on the data above, we noted that the billing schedules and other documents which were recorded in the GL reconciled with the Aging of the Accounts Receivable.  The SLs maintained to support the GL did not tally with the other two records, i.e. the Billing Statements, Schedules and other documents and the Aging of Accounts Receivable.

	

	10)		The purpose of maintaining SLs is to keep the details for a GL’s control account, the total sum of which should always equal the GL balance.  The billing statements, schedules and other documents presented serve only as basis for taking up the receivables in the books.

	

	11)		The practice of maintaining a single SL for several accounts and in lumped amounts defeats its primary purpose of detailing the entries in the GL.  The absence of detailed information for each debtor, does not enable the Accounting Section to trace a certain transaction to the person to whom it is credited for.  In some cases, certain transactions were not recorded, thus resulting in the further understatement of the SL balance.



	12)		Moreover, the eNGAS-generated reports for the GL, the SL and the Aging of Accounts Receivable under the FC-06 have indicated different balances as at year end of CY 2020 resulting in variances, as shown in Table 4.

	14)		Our review of the records for the above data indicates that the maintenance of SLs for Accounts Receivable for both FC-05 and FC-06 books was similar to the records maintained for the GL, hence, tracking the history of transaction for a specific debtor could not be undertaken because the amount was lumped into one account record, while the debtors were grouped in a single SL account.  This practice has caused the balances generated by the system to show variances, thus affecting the fair presentation of the account in the financial statements.



	15)		We recommended that the President require the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) for Finance to reconcile the discrepancies reported in the GLs, the SLs, and the Aging of Accounts Receivable balances under the books of FC-05 and FC-06; and to maintain SLs for each individual debtor so that reconciliation is more efficient.



	16)		Management stated that as recommended, the reconciliation of the discrepancies in the reported GLs and SLs will be undertaken in the books of FC-05.  However, this will take some time because this will be reported to the eTicketing facility of eNGAS.



	17)		The resultant discrepancies in the balances between the GL and the SL as Management claimed, are due to the technical glitches in setting-up the Accounts Receivable in the eNGAS.



	18)		The reconciliation will start in the setting up of the beginning balance, hence will certainly require some time.



	19)		Management has committed to the preparation and maintenance of SLs for each individual debtor for FC-05.  However, this will only be applicable for SLs maintained for the Graduate, MRVNPC (Marcelino R. Veloso National Polytechnic College) - Tabango Campus, and Undergraduate sectors.



	20)		CHED and DepEd SLs will still be maintained, as is, over each student since billing statement is addressed to CHED and DepEd under Republic Act (RA) No. 10931 or the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act.



	21)		Management claimed that it has a separate system whereby individual student ledgers are maintained for all the students of the Institute, and the detailed information per student is updated in the system and reconciled with the SL.



	22)		Management clarified that the difference between the GL and SL balances of FC-06 as presented in Table 4 amounting to P71,957.50 refers to the Accounts Receivable of PIT MRVNPC-Tabango Campus, as per Schedule of Accounts Receivable.  As recommended, reconciliation will be made to correct the discrepancies in the GLs, SLs and the Aging of Accounts Receivable balances.





IGP profit sharing not in accordance with the Manual guidelines; understatement of Due to Officers and Employees; overstatement of Due to Other Funds



2)		The profit sharing for the Income Generating Projects (IGPs) for CY 2020 was not in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the Manual of Operations for IGPs of State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) in Region 8, resulting in the understatement of the Due to Officers and Employees account in the amount of P20,529.10, and overstatement of Due to Other Funds in the amount of P11,405.06.



	1)		The Manual of Operations for IGPs of SUCs in Region 8 provides the IGP profit sharing scheme, to wit:

	

CHAPTER VI



PROFIT SHARING



Xxx



	To effect this profit sharing scheme, all participants shall share certain percentages of the net profit as stipulated under this incentive scheme.



Xxx



	B.	Guidelines



	At the end of every fiscal year, the income statement shall be prepared in order to determine the net profit of each project.  The profit shall be distributed as follows:



	B.1	Twenty-five percent (25%) shall be allotted as a school share.  This can be used by the school to augment its resources to support its programs in instruction, research, and other worthwhile activities of the institution.



	B.2	Twenty percent (20%) shall be for capital build-up.  This amount is intended as a source of additional project capital in case there is a need to expand its operation.



B.3	Twenty percent (20%) as incentives for project manager and project workers.  If possible, ten percent (10%) shall go to the project manager and the remaining ten percent (10%) shall be shared equally by the project workers.



B.4	Five percent (5%) as share to the IGP Director.



B.5	Seven percent (7%) shall be shared equally by the remaining members of the BOM (excluding the IGP Director).



B.6	Fifteen percent (15%) as incentive to the facilitative committee. The sharing of this incentive shall be proportionate to the committee members’ involvement as approved by the BOM.



B.7	Eight percent (8%) shall go to the Head of Agency and other support staff; the sharing of which shall be determined by the SUC President.



B.8	The giving of incentives, except to the Project Manager and workers, is based on the consolidated net income as shown in the following illustrative examples. (emphasis ours)

	2)		Records show that the Institute’s Statement of Financial Performance for IGPs, under the title Statement of Income and Expenses (SIE), reported a total net income of P64,131.46 for the year ended December 31, 2020.  The distribution of this amount, less the 20% capital build-up requirement amounting to P13,399.19, was recorded as follows:

	3)		The SIE for CY 2020 submitted by the Institute (Annex A) shows that one IGP, specifically the Canteen Operations, reported a net loss of P182,480.91.  Our verification of the report disclosed that the implemented IGP profit sharing scheme was not in conformity with the instructions in the Manual of Operations for IGPs of SUCs in Region 8 because it allotted a negative 20% share of the net loss of the Canteen Project to its Project Managers and workers.

	5)		Based on Item B.8 of the Manual, when one project is losing, the Project Managers and workers of the losing project will not receive an incentive.  The implemented profit sharing scheme reduced the amount of the total profit share of the Project Managers and workers due to the negative allotment for the Canteen Project amounting to P36,496.18, and increased the balance of the net profit for allotment as School Share and as incentives for the rest of the IGP Management by the same amount.

	

	6)		The amount of liability for IGP profit shares of the PIT President, members of the Board of Management (BOM), IGP Director and the Project Managers recorded as Due to Officers and Employees should have been P54,512.38 instead of P33,983.28, resulting in the understatement of the account amounting to P20,529.10.  On the other hand, the amount to be recorded as School Share should have only been P5,343.93 instead of P16,748.99, resulting in the overstatement of the Due to Other Funds amounting to P11,405.06.  These errors have affected the reliability of the account balances in the financial statements.



	7)		We recommended that the President require the CAO for Finance/IGP BOM Chairperson to:

	

a)		instruct the personnel in charge to prepare the IGP Profit Sharing Scheme in conformity with the guidelines of the Manual of Operations for IGPs of SUCs in Region 8; and

	

b)		draw the Journal Entry Vouchers (JEV) to effect the necessary adjusting entries to correct the affected accounts as follows:

	

	Account Title

	Debit

	Credit

	Due to Other Funds

			P11,405.06

	

	Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit)

	9,124.04

	

	Due to Officers & Employees

	

	P20,529.10

	

	8)	Management agreed to draw the adjusting entry as recommended, to correct the erroneous computation of profit shares among members of the BOM, IGP Director, Project Managers and the Institute, in conformity with the guidelines of the Manual of Operations for IGP of SUCs in Region 8.

3)		The complete set of ledgers and financial statements of each IGP was not prepared, contrary to Chapter VII of the Manual of Operations for IGPs of SUCs in Region 8.



	1)		Chapter VII of the Manual of Operations for IGPs of SUCs in Region 8 requires:



	Chapter VII



	ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME GENERATING PROJECTS (IGPs)



	The books of accounts for IGPs must be maintained separately. All financial transactions of the IGP must be reported to the facilitative staff as basis for recording in the books of accounts, as follows:



1.

Sales Journal

- xxx

2.

Purchases Journal

- xxx

3.

Cash Receipts Journal

	A. Financial Reports



	The Facilitative Staff based on inputs submitted by project managers as follows should prepare financial Statements for IGP Operations:



	1.	Income Statement

	2.	Cash Flow Statement

	3.	Balance Sheet

	4.	Other statements which may be required if deemed necessary



	The Income Statement shows the results of operations of a project over a certain period of time.  It may coincide with a project's production cycle as in the case of rice, fish and poultry products where goods are sold during production or shortly thereafter.  For projects with a steady sales stream throughout the year such a cafeteria, bakery, or dormitory, the income statement may be prepared on a monthly basis.  Table 4 is a pro-forma Income Statement.



	The Cash Flow Statement reflects a project ability to meet its operating cash requirements by comparing its cash inflows against its cash outflows within a certain period of time.  A carefully prepared Cash Flow statement will aid the BOM in monitoring the cash status of the IGPs and improve profitability by ensuring optimum cash utilization.  Table 5 is an example of a Cash Flow Statement.



	The Balance Sheet is a financial statement showing the Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth of the project.  It is a snapshot of the projects' financial status as of a given time.  It can be prepared in tandem with the other two statements.  A sample Balance Sheet is shown in Table 6.



	2)		During our audit, we discovered that the Facilitative Staff still did not prepare the complete set of financial statements and ledgers for each IGP.  The Accounting personnel only prepared the SIE by Project for the main purpose of determining the net income for the yearly profit distribution.

	

	3)		The CAO for Finance explained that they find it impractical to prepare the financial statements for each IGP because the complete Consolidated Financial Statements for FC-06 also serve the same purpose, and aid the IGP Director and the BOM in their operations.  In addition, all projects operate under the one-fund concept, thus, they did not find it feasible to maintain a complete set of books specifically for each project.



	4)		While the Accounting Unit prepares and maintains general journal, ledgers, and financial statements for FC-06, these are not considered full compliance with the foregoing requirements, which provide that separate books of accounts and financial statements for each IGP must be maintained.

	

	5)		The non-preparation of the complete set of financial statements and ledgers for every IGP precluded the Audit Team from reconciling IGP records to the existing books of accounts for FC-06.



	6)		We recommended that the President require the IGP Facilitative Staff to prepare the complete ledgers and financial statements of each IGP as prescribed in Chapter VII of the Manual of Operations for IGPs of SUCs in Region 8.



	7)		Management agreed to prepare and maintain complete ledgers for each IGP in addition to the financial statements prepared as prescribed in the Manual of Operations for IGPs of SUCs in Region 8.





Dates of receipts of goods procured not indicated



4)		The dates of receipt for goods procured amounting to P4,637,845.25 were not indicated in the Supplier’s Invoice/Delivery Receipt, contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001, thus resulting in the difficulty of computing for liquidated damages, as required under Item 3 of Annex D of the 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of RA No. 9184.  Moreover, the inspection and acceptance for partially delivered goods were held in abeyance pending the complete delivery of the items.



	1)		COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 prescribes the documentary requirements for the procurement of goods, to wit:



	9.1.3.1	Supplies, Materials, Equipment and Motor Vehicles







	General Guidelines



	Xxx



	Additional Documentary Requirements



--		Xxx

--		Original copy of Dealers/Suppliers’ Invoices showing the quantity, description of the articles, unit and total value duly signed by the dealer or his representative, and indicating receipt by the proper agency official of items delivered.

--		Xxx (emphasis ours)



	2)		Annex D of the 2016 RIRR of RA No. 9184 provides thus:



	ANNEX “D”



	CONTRACT IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF GOODS, SUPPLIES AND MATERIALS



Xxx



1)		Liquidated Damages



	3.1.	When the supplier fails to satisfactorily deliver goods under the contract within the specified delivery schedule, inclusive of duly granted time extensions, if any, the supplier shall be liable for damages for the delay and shall pay the procuring entity liquidated damages, not by way of penalty, an amount equal to one-tenth (1/10) of one percent (1%) of the cost of the delayed goods scheduled for delivery for every day of delay until such goods are finally delivered and accepted by the procuring entity concerned.



	3.2.	The procuring entity need not prove that it has incurred actual damages to be entitled to liquidated damages.  Such amount shall be deducted from any money due or which may become due to the supplier, or collected from any securities or warranties posted by the supplier, whichever is convenient to the procuring entity concerned.  In no case shall the total sum of liquidated damages exceed ten percent (10%) of the total contract price, in which event the procuring entity concerned may rescind the contract and impose appropriate sanctions over and above the liquidated damages to be paid.



Xxx



	3)		In relation to this, Appendix 62 (D) of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II, provides instructions in accomplishing the Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR), to wit:

	

D.	The Supply and/or Property Custodian shall acknowledge receipt of the items by indicating in the “Acceptance” portion of the IAR, his/her name, signature, date of acceptance, and a check “” mark whether the delivery is complete or partial as to quantity (specify quantity received, if partial).

	

	4)		Our review of the transaction documents relative to the Institute’s payment for the procurement of goods undertaken through Public Bidding revealed that the Suppliers’ Invoices/Delivery Receipts for contracts totaling P4,637,845.25 did not indicate the delivery date, and the date of receipt by the Supply Officer.

	

	5)		Further, the inspection of the delivered goods was done several days after the expected date of delivery per contract, as shown in Table 8.

	6)		From the data above we noted that deliveries were usually inspected very late of up to seventy days, and the date when these items were received is not indicated by the Supply Officer in the Acceptance Reports.

	

	7)		Our interview with the Supply Office revealed that they did not have any records on hand to provide the exact dates when these goods were actually delivered and received.  They were only able to provide the month of receipt because this is made part of the generation of the Property Number.  He also explained that the reason why inspection was done several days after delivery is because some components or parts were delivered on a later date.

	

	8)		The Supply Officer is not precluded from conducting the inspection and acceptance of partially delivered goods since the IAR form itself provides boxes to indicate whether the delivery is complete or partial.

	

	9)		Had the inspection and acceptance been conducted by the Supply Officer on the actual date of delivery of goods, the exact date would have been indicated in the IAR.  Those goods which have been completely delivered could be easily identified from those goods partially delivered, thus, facilitating the computation of liquidated damages.

	

	10)		The non-indication of the date when the goods were actually delivered or received is prejudicial to the interest of the government as the computation of liquidated damages for late deliveries cannot be efficiently imposed.  Rather, the supplier is given the advantage of late deliveries because we cannot determine whether the goods were delivered within the prescribed period, and according to the specifications, as indicated in the contract.

	

	11)		We recommended that the President require the Supply Officer to indicate the correct dates of receipt in the “Received” portion of the Supplier’s Invoice/Delivery Receipt as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2012-001, to determine whether the goods were promptly delivered, and to impose liquidated damages for late deliveries.



	12)		Management agreed to implement the audit recommendation to conduct inspection and acceptance of partially delivered goods, and to indicate the correct dates of receipt in the “RECEIVED” portion of the Supplier’s Invoice/Delivery Receipt as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2012-001.





PCFRec not maintained by Petty Cash Custodian



5)		The Petty Cash Fund Custodian (PCFC) does not maintain the Petty Cash Fund Record (PCFRec) prescribed in Section 37, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, and Appendix 50 of Volume II of the same Manual, thereby causing difficulty in determining the cash accountability of the accountable officer as of year end.



	1)		Section 37, Chapter 6 of GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides:



Chapter 6



DISBURSEMENTS



	Sec. 37. Accounting Books, Records, Forms and Reports to be Prepared and Maintained. The PCFC shall prepare the RPPCV and maintain the Petty Cash Fund Record (PCFR) (Appendix 50) to monitor and control the granting and utilization of the fund. The RPPCVs shall be the basis in the preparation of the DV to replenish the PCF.  The Accounting Division/Unit shall record the replenishment of PCF in the CkDJ through a JEV and shall maintain SL to monitor and control accountability.



	2)		Appendix 50 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II, provides:



	PETTY CASH FUNDS RECORD

	(PCFRec)



	INSTRUCTIONS



A)		Each PCFC shall maintain this PCFR to record his/her cash advance, utilization and replenishment made and to monitor the PCF balance.  All transactions for the day shall be recorded immediately.



	3)		Our review of the records disclosed that the PCFC handling the petty cash for FC-06 did not maintain the PCFRec.

	

	4)		In our interview with the PCFC, she told the Audit Team that she was not aware; nor was she informed that she has to prepare and maintain the PCFRec when the custodianship of the petty cash fund was assigned to her by virtue of her designation on January 1, 2020.



	5)		A properly accomplished and updated PCFRec shows a correct and complete record of all cash advances received and disbursements made.  The absence of such record renders it difficult to determine the accountable officer’s accountability for the petty cash fund balance as at a given period.



	6)		We recommended that the President require the Petty Cash Fund Custodian to prepare and maintain the PCFRec as prescribed by the GAM for NGAs, Volume II, to facilitate the determination of the latter’s cash accountability and the correctness of such balance at a given period.



	7)		Management agreed to implement the audit recommendation to prepare and maintain the PCFRec as prescribed by the GAM for NGAs.



Non-submission of supporting documents to the GAD AR



6)		The CY 2020 GAD Accomplishment Report (AR) submitted through the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) was not properly accomplished, and its supporting documents were not submitted to the Audit Team, contrary to pertinent provisions of Joint Circular (JC) No. 2012-01 issued by PCW, National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) and Department of Budget and Management (DBM); and PCW Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2021-01.



	1)		PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 pertinently provides:



10.0	PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF GAD ACCOMPLISHMENT REPORTS



10.1	Attached agencies, bureaus, regional offices, constituent units and all others concerned shall submit their GAD ARs to their central offices.  The agency GFPS shall prepare the annual GAD AR based on the PCW-endorsed GPB or the GPB adjusted to the approved GAA following the form prescribed in Annex B.



Xxx



	10.4	The annual GAD AR shall be accompanied by the following: (1) brief summary of the reported program or project; (2) copies of reported policy issuances; (3) results of HGDG tests, if any; and (4) actions taken by the agency on the COA audit findings and recommendations, if any.

	

Xxx

	

	ANNEX B:	GUIDE IN COMPLETING THE GAD ACCOMPLISHMENT REPORT TEMPLATE

	

	Column 9: Actual Cost or Expenditure

	

	This column shows the actual cost or expenditure in implementing the identified GAD activities of the previous GPB. To avoid double counting and attribution, the agency shall provide a breakdown of the expenditure if necessary.

	

	2)		Whereas, PCW MC No. 2021-01 dated January 20, 2021 states:

	

1)	All line departments, constitutional bodies, judicial and legislative bodies, attached agencies/bureaus, other executive offices (OEOs) and government-owned and/or controlled corporations (GOCCs) shall submit their consolidated FY 2020 GAD Accomplishment Reports (ARs) to PCW through the PCW Gender Mainstreaming Monitoring System (GMMS) on or before the following dates:

	

	26 February 2021

	Deadline of state universities and colleges (SUCs) for the encoding and submission of FY 2020 GAD AR through the GMMS, for review of Commission on Higher Education (CHED) regional offices

	

	1)		To attribute the expenditure of a major agency program/project to GAD in the FY 2020 GAD AR, agencies shall accomplish the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG) Project Implementation and Management, and Monitoring and Evaluation (PIMME) checklist (HGDG Boxes 16 & 17) or the Facility Implementation, Management, and Monitoring and Evaluation (FIMME) checklist (HGDG Box F2), whichever is applicable, to assess the gender-responsiveness of the implementation of the program/project.

	

	1)		PDF copies of the results of HGDG PIMME/FIMME checklist, the program/project brief and accomplishment report; details of expenditure, as well as the relevant MOVs (means of verification) for the agency self-rating, such as attendance sheets, monitoring tools, or list of sex-disaggregated data or gender statistics have been used and/or collected, among others, shall be attached to the agency’s GAD AR submission.

	

	3)		Our verification of the Institute’s CY 2020 GAD AR submitted to the PCW through the GMMS shows zero actual expenditure and zero percent utilization of the GAD Budget.  Upon confirmation from the GFPS clerk, there were expenditures actually incurred for GAD activities conducted in CY 2020.  Column 9 of the GAD AR, which was supposed to show the actual cost or expenditure for each GAD activity, was inadvertently left blank in the accomplishment of the GAD AR submitted to the PCW through the GMMS.



	4)		A revised report was requested from the GFPS, and the report presented an actual expenditure of P14,331,428.79, which was 6.39% of the total budget appropriations of P224,365,000.00.



	5)		A further examination of the GAD AR showed that capital outlay projects totaling P12,673,000.00 were attributed to GAD, as follows:

	6)		Moreover, the accomplishments shown in the GAD AR also included the attribution of electricity consumption of the PIT Main Campus amounting to P279,250.00, and the hiring of security personnel amounting to P100,000.00.



	7)		However, the supporting documents to the GAD AR, such as the brief summary of the reported program/project, details of expenditure, attendance sheets, sex-disaggregated data, and HGDG test results, have yet to be submitted to the Audit Team for validation.



	8)		The absence of these supporting documents has resulted in the Audit Team’s difficulty in monitoring the utilization of GAD funds, as well as the verification and evaluation of the amounts attributed to GAD in relation to the responsiveness of the GAD-attributed programs/projects to existing gender issues in the Institute.



	9)		We recommended that the President require the GAD Focal Point System in charge to properly accomplish the GAD AR being submitted through the PCW GMMS, and to submit to the Audit Team the supporting documents together with the GAD AR, pursuant to PCW-NEDA-DBM JC No. 2012-01 and PCW MC No. 2021-01.



	10)		Management’s comments through a written reply to the AOM are quoted as follows:



“1. The Institute had submitted the GAD AR 2020 through the PCW GMMS on February 26, 2021 which was received and acknowledged by CHEDRO8 which further reviewed the AR before it would be endorsed to PCW.  The GAD AR was further endorsed by the CHEDRO Director, Dr. George Colorado to PCW on March 25, 2021.  The undersigned verified from the CHEDRO GAD AR reviewer on possible lacking entries or documents so that, the discrepancies, if any, could be rectified.  The undersigned also anticipates communication from PCW for further need to correct or rectify entries in the GAD AR.



2. We humbly ask apology that the hard copies of the GAD AR and supporting documents were submitted to the COA RO8 office only on April 30, 2021.  The GFPS clerk already submitted soft copy on April 12, 2021 and another soft copy on April 15 as requested.  It was only when the hard copies were requested that this Office submitted the hard copies on April 30.”



	11)		The GAD AR, which was generated through the GMMS with the Document Status: UNENDORSED (Annex B), is the official report submitted to the PCW.  This was the first report submitted to the Audit Team through e-mail on April 12, 2021, but without the supporting documents.  It was this report wherein the Audit Team saw the zero percentage of GAD Expenditure, so the Audit Team asked the GFPS Clerk if there was no GAD-related expenditure for CY 2020.  When the GFPS Clerk told the Audit Team that there were actual expenditures for CY 2020, we requested that she submit a corrected report, which she did through e-mail on April 15, 2021, again without the supporting documents.  It was an excel file of their unsigned CY 2020 GAD AR, and was not the report generated through the PCW GMMS.



	12)		Management also commented in their written reply that they have attributed a portion of its electricity consumption and the hiring of security personnel since it has been understood that the allocation of sufficient power supply in the campus allows the provision of sufficient lighting in the classrooms and offices and along the pathways especially during night time in order to keep the place secure from untoward happenings that may endanger students and employees.  They further invoked RA No. 11313, otherwise known as Safe Spaces Act, which recognizes that both men and women must have equality, security and safety not only in private, but also on the streets, public spaces, online, workplaces and educational and training institutions.



	13)		The Audit Team agrees that said expenditures may be attributed to GAD, however, the supporting schedules for the determination of the percentage used for electricity consumption and security services attributed to GAD were not submitted to the Audit Team.



7)		Compliance with Tax Laws



	1)		Due to BIR reported a beginning balance of P199,640.30 in CY 2020; withheld taxes in the total amount of P15,584,086.34; remitted the amount of P15,480,796.17 during the year; and leaving a balance of P302,930.47 as of December 31, 2020.

Status of Implementation and Results of Auditor’s Validation

1)		

The reliability and accuracy of the year-end balances of the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account and Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Savings Account amounting to P39,167,481.08 and P12,693,735.36, respectively,  could not be ascertained in view of the following: a) erroneous recording of deposit of P6,308,750.00 to the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Savings Account instead of Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account, both of Fund Cluster 05 (FC-05); savings deposit of P247,293.11 recorded in the book of FC-05 instead of Fund Cluster 06 (FC-06); b) not reverted balance of fund transfer for Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) of Tabango Campus amounting to P73,760.83 under the Regular Agency Fund (FC-01); and c) stale checks of P1,800.00 were still included as outstanding checks, rendering the balance unreliable, and affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements as of December 31, 2019.  Moreover, a total of P125,298.78‬ of prior years’ bank errors remained uncorrected by the servicing bank‬.‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬



We recommended that the President require the Accountant to:



1)	draw Journal Entry Voucher (JEV) on the cancellation of stale checks and restoration of the amount to the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account and Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Savings Account, following the procedures prescribed in GAM for NGAS, Volume I;



2)	exercise prudence in booking up transactions to prevent recording in the wrong Fund Cluster books, and over/understating the balances of cash in bank accounts;



3)	inform the bank in writing, with the copy of the BRS furnished showing the reconciling items discovered and regularly coordinate/follow up with bank officers for the prompt and proper address to the reconciling items; and



4)	henceforth, recognize all reconciling items that require adjustment and correction in the books by promptly preparing a JEV for every bank reconciliation or as soon as the errors are discovered.

AAR CY 2019Observation No. 1





























































































Management drawn JEV Nos. 2020-000027 and 2020-000007, both dated January 1, 2020, to correct the unintentional recording of deposits amounting to P6,308,750.00 to Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Savings Account instead of recording the deposits to Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account and to correct the savings deposit of P247,293.11 in the book of FC 06 instead of FC 05, respectively.



Additionally, JEV Nos. 2020-06-000698 and 2020-09-001040 dated June 30,2020 and September 30, 2020 were also drawn to record the restoration of stale checks amounting to P1,500.00 and 300.00 respectively.

2)		

The reliability and accuracy of the year-end balances of Accounts Receivable amounting to P18,019,268.73 could not be ascertained due to: a) the non-collectability of dormant accounts totaling P4,216,606.47, which have been relatively non-moving or dormant for twelve to fourteen years and above; and b) the existence of abnormal/negative balances in the SLs totaling P15,145.00 causing a reduced reported year-end balance by the same amount, thus, affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements.



We recommended that the President require the Accountant to:



5)	file the request for authority to write off the dormant Accounts Receivable balance in accordance with the guidelines and procedures in COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016;



6)	strengthen Management’s monitoring system to avoid accumulation of uncollected receivables, which eventually become dormant due to non-settlement for a long period of time;



7)	update records with the necessary contact details of borrowers such as the present address and employment records to facilitate collection;





8)	send collection letters with return cards to all debtors with complete addressees, to those living in neighboring towns, and to those whom they have contact with personally; and



9)	investigate the causes of the abnormal balances and draw the necessary adjusting entries to arrive at the correct balance.

10)  We recommended that the PIT President require the Accountant to prepare another batch of collection letters to be sent with return cards to all debtors with complete addressees, to those living in neighboring towns, and to those whom they have contact with personally.  We further recommend that the PIT President should request officers concerned to evaluate the possibility of collections from those with no complete addresses.

4)		

The reliability and accuracy of the year-end balance of the Loans Receivable-Others amounting to P1,616,888.00 could not be ascertained due to the non-recognition of Allowance for Impairment/Impairment Loss of the account and the erroneous charging of loans granted to students amounting to P123,000.00 to Internally Generated Fund (FC-05) instead of Trust Receipt (FC-07) thus, affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements as of December 31, 2019.  Moreover, Management failed to collect the outstanding loans receivables and to derecognize the outstanding Loans Receivable-Others, aged ten years and above in compliance with COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016.



	We recommended that the PIT President require the Accountant to:

	

1)	draw a JEV to provide an Allowance for Impairment/Impairment Loss for the Loans Receivable-Others account;















2)	transfer/restore the amount of P123,000.00 to FC-05 and draw a JEV to correct the error on the Cash in Bank-Local Currency, Current Account and Loans Receivable-Others of both the FC-05 and FC-07 books; and

	We recommended that the President constitute a working Inventory Committee and require:

	

4)	the constituted Inventory Committee, to conduct the physical count of Inventories and render a reconciled report within the GAM-prescribed period; and henceforth, conduct a well-timed and judiciously planned annual physical inventory count of all Inventories.



5)	the Accountant, Supply Officer and the Inventory Committee, to reconcile the RPCI, SLCs and SCs to eliminate the variances, if there are any and to ensure the existence and accuracy of the reported balances of the Inventories as at year end.

Management’s assertions of existence, ownership and accuracy of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts totaling P393,235,159.66 as of yearend could not be relied upon due to the failure of the Inventory Committee of both PIT Main and Tabango Campuses to conduct a complete physical count of all PPEs; and failure of the Accounting and the Supply Offices to complete the reconciliation of the PPE Ledger Cards (PPELC), Property Cards (PCs) and the Report on the Physical Count of PPE (RPCPPE), which resulted in variances amounting to P7,060,016.36, thus rendering the year-end balance unreliable.



	We recommended that the President require:

	

9)	the constituted Inventory Committees, to conduct the physical count of PPEs and render a reconciled report within the GAM-prescribed period; and henceforth, conduct a well-timed and judiciously planned annual physical inventory count of all PPEs; and

	We recommended that the President require:

	



11)	The Supply Officers of both campuses to regularly reconcile their respective PPE records with the Ledger Cards maintained by the Accounting Office to eliminate the prevalence of variances of some PPE accounts to ensure the accuracy of the reported balances of the PPE accounts as of year-end; and

9)		

Management’s assertions of existence, rights and accuracy of balances presented in the Financial Statements cannot be relied upon because of the unreconciled combined discrepancy of P74,371,170.25 between the accounting records and the physical inventory count of various Property, Plant and Equipment accounts, unavailability of relevant details corresponding to Prior Years’ forwarded balance for School Buildings amounting to P 8,829,180.76, inclusion of School Building donated to MRVHS, Leyte Division, DepEd amounting to P7,974,034.00, incomplete conduct of physical inventory count by both Campuses and non-maintenance of Property Cards by the MRVNPC, Tabango Campus, thereby casting doubts on the reliability of the account balances presented in the financial statements.



	We recommended that the President:

	

1)		Direct the Chief Administrative Officer for Finance to review all pertinent accounting records and investigate the causes of the huge discrepancies, verify and investigate thoroughly the unreconciled balances and make the necessary adjustment to come up with the accurate balance of each PPE account;

	

2)	Require the Property Officers of both the Main and MRVNPC Tabango Campus to maintain updated Property Cards and to regularly reconcile the same with the Ledger Cards maintained by the Accounting Unit; and

	

3)	Create an inventory committee that will conduct the proper periodic campus-wide inventory of the Institute’s PPEs at least once a year and render a report thereon using the prescribed form (Appendix 73, GAM Volume III) and submit the same within the prescribed period in conformity with Sections 38 and 42, Chapter 10 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) Volume I.

10)		

The accuracy and reliability of the reported balances of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts totaling P136,773,929.46 as of year-end is doubtful in view of the variances noted between books and inventory report totaling P26,805,845.30 caused by (i) non-reconciliation between the Accounting and the Supply Officer’s records; (ii)  inappropriate charging of obligation under FC 01 on the variation order for one infrastructure project to MOOE thereby understating the School Buildings account by P329,998.50, contrary to Section 42, Chapter 10 of GAM Vol. I and Section 33 of the GAA General Provisions for FY 2016.



4)	We recommended that the Accounting Unit and the Supply Office regularly reconcile their records and reports for PPE accounts in conformity with Section 42, Chapter 10 of GAM Vol. I. The Accountant shall prepare the necessary adjusting entries to correct the balances in the appropriate books.

11)		

The carrying value of the Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) accounts, amounting to P105,040,450.28, is doubtful in view of (i) the non-adjustment of the residual value of each item in the books from 10% to 5% based on PPSAS 17; (ii) failure to provide an impairment in accordance with PPSAS 21; (iii) the non-dropping of lost/damaged properties, amounting to P28,745,285.09, that could not be dropped from the books due to management’s failure to apply for relief from accountability; and (iv) the unaccounted beginning balances amounting to P24,307,060.03 in contravention to its assertion on “Existence”.



We recommended that management should



5)	drop from the books lost/damaged properties;



6)	 apply for relief from property accountability; and 



7)	continue to identify, reclassify or drop PPE assets with unaccounted beginning balances in the books.

Reliability of the balance of the Property, Plant and Equipment account aggregating  P167,398,143.94 could not be ascertained in view of: (i) the absence of adequate subsidiary records containing details and breakdown  for some properties totaling P27,172,881.81, which is 17% of the total  PPE balance;  (ii) non-submission of inventory reports on PPE as basis for the validation of their existence; (iii) the inclusion of fully depreciated/ unserviceable and lost  properties in the account; and (iv) absence of reconciliation between GL and subsidiary records, as well as Property Section’s records.



We recommended that management should  



8)	Require the Accountant to maintain adequate Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card (PPELC) and Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger Card – Specific Item (PPELC-SI);

PIT failed to observe the timely disposal of PPE items valued at P2,820,264.60 which has been identified as unserviceable as early as calendar year (CY) 2015 and classified in the books as Other Assets, thus exposing the assets to further deterioration and decline in value.



	We recommended that the President require the:

Insurance payments to GSIS for the insurable properties and other assets of the Institute were taken-up outright as Insurance Expense in the amount of P1,548,901.39 and inadvertently booked-up P37,804.50 as Taxes, Duties and Licenses, resulting in understatement of the Prepaid Insurance account by P804,732.22, overstating the Insurance Expense by P766,927.70 and the Taxes, Duties and Licenses by P37,804.50, thus affecting the fair presentation of the accounts in the FS.



15)	We recommended that the President require the Accountant to recognize the prepayment at the onset of recording the disbursement transaction and make use of the eNGAS generated Prepayment Schedule in booking the expired portion every end of the month.
