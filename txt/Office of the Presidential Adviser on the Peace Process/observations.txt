OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS





A)	Financial and Compliance Audit



Maintenance of bank accounts without authority 



1)		Cash in bank accounts with total balance of P50,468,260.69 were not remitted yet to the National Treasury as there being no action taken on the previous audit recommendation to comply with EO No. 338 dated May 17, 1996, as implemented under COA-DBM-DOF Joint Circular No. 1-97 dated January 2, 1997.

	

EO No. 338, as implemented under COA-DBM-DOF JC No. 1-97 provides that “all existing balances of trust receipts deposited with authorized government depository banks or any forthcomings trust receipt which are intended to be deposited with authorized government depository banks are hereby required to be deposited with the National Treasury.”

Of the seven bank accounts, two are being maintained without authority. Volume III of the GAM for NGAs states that the Cash in Bank-LCCA “is used to recognize deposits with AGDBs of income received for which the agency has authority to use; trust receipts authorized under specific contracts and agreements; Revolving Fund under specific laws; and credit advices/memos received from the AGDBs.”



In CY 2018 and CY 2019, the Audit Team made observations regarding the Agency’s maintenance of substantial cash balance under the Cash in Bank – LCCA account without the required authority, thus to be remitted to the National Treasury. However, in CY 2020, the same condition still existed. 

	

Details of the balance of such account in the total amount of P50,468,260.69 are presented below:



1)  OPAPP-Current Account (CA) – P50,166,592.70



Maintained for domestic funds and serves as trust account of OPAPP.  This was originally used for MILF Funds transferred from the Office of the President (OP) for the talks between the Government and the MILF. 



2)   Re-Integration Program Fund – P301,667.99



--	Total funds deposited since the start of project in 2003 was P10,000.000.00;

--	Sourced from the President’s Social Funds (PSF) under the Presidential Management Staff (PMS) to support the re-integration to mainstream society and other development undertakings of Alleged Political Offenders (APOs) who were former Rebolusyonaryong Partido ng Manggagawa-Pilipinas/ Revolutionary Proletarian Army/Alex Boncayao Brigade (RPM-P/RPA/ABB).



Analysis of the foregoing balances revealed that these were accumulated from the transactions of the agency prior to CY 2020 as a result of Management’s non-remittance of deposits to the National Treasury contrary to the provisions of EO No. 338, as implemented under COA-DBM-DOF- JC No. 1-97.



Management commented that they will prioritize the submission of the request from the Permanent Committee on the maintenance of special accounts.



Also, Management stated that the Finance Unit would coordinate with the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) for the closing of the mentioned special accounts.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief of FAS to make representation with the Permanent Committee for the authority to maintain special accounts pursuant to DOF-DBM-COA JC No. 4-12, otherwise, their balance should be remitted to the National Treasury for lack of explicit authority to maintain such special accounts.

Non-liquidation of cash advances within the reglementary period



2)	Deficiencies were noted in  the granting and liquidation of the advances to Special Disbursing Officers of which out of the year-end balance of P33,430,473.48, a total of P14,925,969.21 or 45 percent remained unliquidated for one to five years contrary to the provisions of COA Circular 97-002 dated February 10, 1997; and  a total of P9,322,319.67 were granted to 23 accountable officers even if the previous cash advances have not been liquidated and accounted for in the books contrary with  Section 89 of PD 1445. 



			The Advances to SDOs account showed a balance of P33,430,473.48 as of December 31, 2020, summarized as follows:

a.    Unliquidated cash advances for one to five years



The granting, utilization and liquidation of cash advances are prescribed under the following rules and regulations:



COA Circular No. 97-002 states that: 



--	When a cash advance is no longer needed or has not been used for a period of two months, it must be returned to or refunded immediately to the Collecting Officer.



--	All cash advances shall be fully liquidated at the end of each year.  Except for petty cash fund, the accountable officer (AO) shall refund any unexpended balance to the Cashier/Collecting Officer who will issue the necessary official receipt.



For CY 2020, the Management sent demand letters to various AOs and this resulted to the increase of liquidation percentage to 71.39%. However, of the total balance of Advances to SDOs account disclosed that P14,925,969.21 or 45% remained unliquidated for 1 to 5 years already. Aging schedule is shown on the next page:

We recommended and Management agreed to:

	

a)		Require the AOs to refund the excess balance of cash advance immediately or within the prescribed periods after completion/termination of the purpose thereof; and

	

b)		Submit to the Audit Team proof of exhaustion of all administrative remedies taken by the Accountant in requiring the liquidation/settlement of cash advances in preparation for the filing of appropriate charges in case the accountable officers failed to comply.

	



b.	Cash advances granted even if the previous ones have not been liquidated and accounted for in the books of accounts



Section 89 of PD 1445 states that:

 

“No cash advance shall be given unless for a legally specific purpose. A cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been served. No additional cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.”



Examination of the account Advances to SDOs showed that additional cash advances totaling P9,322,319.67 were granted to various accountable officers (AO) even if the previous cash advances have not been liquidated and accounted for in the books of accounts as shown in the table below:

The granting of cash advances to AOs with previous unliquidated cash advances of P9,322,319.67 contributed to the accumulation of balances by 28% of the total year-end unliquidated cash advances of P33,430,473.48. 



The non-compliance with the rules and regulations on the granting and liquidation of cash advances is considered weakness in the control of government resources.  The longer is the unutilized funds in the hands of the AOs, the higher probability of exposing such funds to possible misuse or misapplication or loss. 



We recommended and Management agreed to ensure that all documentary/procedural requirements are complied with prior to the processing of the cash advance and that no cash advance shall be drawn unless the previous cash advance had been properly liquidated and taken up in the books.











Long outstanding balance of Accounts Payable

	

3)		The balance of the Accounts Payable amounting to P172,062,246.24 as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to the inclusion of the unreverted amount of P10,557,729.17 representing the account outstanding for two years or more, contrary to EO No. 87 and Section 98 of PD No. 1445.   

		

Section 1 of EO 87 ordered that:



All documented accounts payable for fiscal year 2016 and years prior thereto shall be reverted to the Accumulated Surplus or Deficit of the General Fund, or the Cumulative Result of Operations of the National Government. Henceforth, all documented accounts payable which remain outstanding for at least two years, for which no actual administrative or judicial claim has been filed, shall be subject to automatic reversion.



While Section 98 of PD No. 1445 states that:



The Commission, upon notice to the head of agency, may revert to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund of the national government, any unliquidated balance of accounts payable in the books of the national government, which has been outstanding for two years or more and against which no actual claim, administrative or judicial, has been filed or which is not covered by perfected contracts on record.  This section shall not apply to unliquidated balances of accounts payable in trust funds as long as the purposes for which the funds were created have not been accomplished.  



	    The balance of the Accounts Payable at year end is composed of the following:

The audit recommendations contained in Part 2 of the Calendar Year (CY) 2019 Annual Audit Report (AAR) requiring the Accounting Section to revert to the Unappropriated Surplus of the General Fund those payables, which remained outstanding for two years or more, and for which the implementation of the programs/projects has already been accomplished.



Review, however, of the Aging of Accounts Payable revealed that account balances in the total amount of P10,557,729.17 or 6 percent of the outstanding balance of Accounts Payable, remained outstanding and unreverted to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund. The aging of the account as of December 31, 2020 is as follows:

Moreover, examination of the balance of the Accounts Payable under the Special Funds disclosed that P356,047.70 of the total amount of P10,557,729.17 remained outstanding for over two years despite completion/accomplishment of the purpose of the implementation of the programs/projects, as pointed out in the CY 2019 AAR.

As stated in the EO, the existence of prior years’ accounts payable in the books of accounts of agencies unnecessarily immobilizes public funds, hampers efforts to determine the actual financial condition of the national government, and hinders effective resource planning and allocation.



We reiterated our recommendation and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant to revert to the Unappropriated Surplus of the General Fund the remaining payables which are outstanding for two years and more, particularly pertaining to those accounts and funds for which the implementation of the programs/projects has been completed and accomplished.





	Existence of Dormant Accounts

	

4)	Cash and Receivables accounts’ balances amounting to P42,834,531.39 remained dormant or non-moving for more than five years due to lack of appropriate action taken despite previous audit recommendations to comply with COA Circular Nos. 97-001 and 2015-001 dated February 5, 1997 and January 29, 2015, respectively.



Under COA Circular No. 97-001, the following terms shall be construed to mean as follows:



i)	Dormant Accounts - refer to individual or group of accounts, which balances remained non-moving for more than five years.



ii)	Dormant Funds - refer to funds with their own assets, liabilities and residual equity created for specific projects/programs, the implementation of which have been completed and the account balances remained non-moving for more than five years.



COA Circular No. 2015-001 prescribes the guidelines and procedures in the reversion to the General Fund of all dormant cash balances, unauthorized accounts and unnecessary special and trust funds by national government agencies (NGAs) with depository banks.  The said guidelines and procedures are in conformity with the Permanent Committee JC No. 4-2012 dated September 11, 2012, implementing EO No. 431 dated May 30, 2005.



While COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19, 2016 prescribes the guidelines and procedures on the Write-Off of Dormant Receivable Accounts, Unliquidated Cash Advances and Fund Transfers (FTs) of NGAs. Among others, it provides the following:



Dormant Unliquidated Cash Advances – advances granted to disbursing officers, agency officers and employees which remained non-moving for ten (10) years or more and where settlement/collectability could no longer be ascertained.



The Accountant shall prepare aging of dormant receivables, unliquidated cash advances and fund transfers on a quarterly basis to support the request for write-off and indicate in the remarks column the existence of the applicable conditions as follows:



a)	Absence of records or documents to validate/support the claim and/or unreconciled reciprocal accounts;

b)	Death of the accountable office/employee/debtor;

c)	Unknown whereabouts of the accountable office/employee/debtor; and that he/she could not be located despite diligent efforts to find him/her;

d)	Incapacity to pay or insolvency;

e)	Exhaustion of all possible remedies by the Management to collect the receivables and to demand liquidation of cash advances and fund transfer; and

f)	No pending case in court involving the subject dormant account.



The Head of the government entity shall file the request for authority to write-off dormant receivable accounts, unliquidated cash advances and FT to the COA Audit Team Leader (ATL) and/or Supervising Auditor (SA). No filing fee is required. 



As at December 31, 2020, the balance of dormant accounts totaled P42,834,351.39, with details shown below.

Per confirmation with Government Servicing Banks (GSBs) particularly with the LBP, the balances of the respective bank accounts are already dormant as of December 31, 2020; thus, instead of earning interests, these are incurring dormancy fees.



Likewise, verification of the aforesaid accounts and funds disclosed that the implementation of the projects/programs has already been completed/implemented and/or terminated.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant to:



a)	conduct thorough analysis of the cash accounts, particularly pertaining to those accounts and funds, which are non-moving for more than five years; funds which are dormant and are no longer necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which the funds were established/received and/or the project implementation has been completed, terminated, cancelled or abandoned;



b)	return the unutilized balances to the Source Agency/donors/financing entities in the case of grants or foreign-funded programs/projects wherein the attendant agreements require the return of unused balances or remit the same to the National Treasury; and 



c)	request an authority from COA to write-off the receivables, which are dormant or remained outstanding for 10 years or more following the requirements stated under COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19. 2016.





B)				Others

			

			Gender and Development (GAD) Plan and Budget

			

5)	For CY 2020, OPAPP allocated P25,124,455.00 or 1.37 percent of its total budget of P1,828,757,000.00 for the implementation of various GAD related activities, utilizing a total of P3,798,350.00, which is only 15.12 percent of the allocated budget and only 0.002 percent of its regular appropriations, thus, the intended benefits of the plan were not fully achieved.



Section 31 of the General Provisions (GP) of the GAA CY 2020 or RA No. 11465 provides, among others, that all agencies of the government shall formulate a GAD Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement the applicable provisions under RA 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women.  The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which shall be at least five percent of their budgets.

			

Verification of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) showed that OPAPP allocated P25,124,455.00 or 1.37 percent of its regular appropriation of P1,828,757,000.00 for the implementation of several GAD-related activities for CY 2020.  The actual expenditures reported in the 2020 Annual GAD Accomplishment Report submitted to the Philippine Commission on Women totaled to P3,798,350.00 or 15.12 percent of the GPB and 0.002 percent of its regular appropriations.



OPAPP budgeted 45 GAD activities for CY 2020 and out of the 45 activities, only 11 have an actual result. 



We recommended and  Management agreed to require the concerned GAD Focal Point System to: 



a)	Strictly adhere with the provisions of the GP of the GAA and ensure that at least five percent of its budget is allocated to provide more comprehensive and responsive GAD plans and programs; and



b)	Formulate a more feasible GAD plan and programs that could be implemented for a given period.



			

6)				Programs and Projects related to Senior Citizens and Persons With Disability (PWDs)

			

Section 32 of the GP of GAA CY 2020 or RA No. 11465 directs all government agencies to formulate plans, programs and projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions, and integrate the same in their regular activities.

			

Management, however, was not able to formulate plans/projects related to the concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability in the Agency for CY 2020, thus, no related expenses were incurred during the year.



We recommended and  Management agreed to formulate programs and projects intended to address the concerns of Senior Citizens and PWDs.



			

7)	Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM)



For CY 2020, the OPAPP attended lectures related to DRRM and conducted earthquake/fire drills to raise awareness and develop security and safety practices in line with the goal of the government on DRRM.







8)				Compliance with Tax laws 

			

Management remitted monthly to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) the Value Added Tax (VAT) and other percentage taxes withheld on goods and services, creditable income taxes and on compensation of personnel through the Tax Remittance Advice (TRA), in compliance with the Department of Finance (DOF) and DBM Joint Circular No. 1-2000A dated July 31, 2001. 

			

Joint Circular No. 1-2000A requires all NGAs to prepare and file the TRAs to cover remittance of taxes withheld supported by applicable Withholding Tax Returns with the concerned BIR-Revenue District Office on or before the 10th day of the following month after the taxes is withheld.

			

Verification of the summary of withholding tax showed that the balance of the Due to BIR account amounted to P3,537,899.23 as at December 31, 2020, with details shown below.
