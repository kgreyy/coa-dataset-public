It was conducted to (a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the Management’s assertion on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and regulations; and (c) determine the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.  Moreover, the audit was conducted in accordance International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). 





E)	Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements



		The Auditor rendered an unqualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the financial statements of the OPAPP for CY 2020.





F)	Summary of Significant Observations and Recommendations



The following are the significant audit observations and corresponding recommendations, which were discussed with Management officials concerned, details of which are contained in the Part II of this report.  Management views and comments were incorporated in the report, where appropriate:



1)		Cash in bank accounts with a total balance of P50,468,260.69 were not remitted yet to the National Treasury as there being no action taken on the previous audit recommendation to comply with EO No. 338 dated May 17, 1996, as implemented under Commission on Audit (COA)-Department of Budget and Management (DBM)-Department of Finance (DOF) Joint Circular (JC) No. 1-97 dated January 2, 1997.

	

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief of Finance and Administrative Services (FAS) to make representation with the Permanent Committee for the authority to maintain special accounts pursuant to DOF-DBM-COA JC No. 4-12, otherwise, their balance should be remitted to the National Treasury for lack of explicit authority to maintain such special accounts.



2)		Deficiencies were noted in  the granting and liquidation of the advances to Special Disbursing Officers of which out of the year-end balance of P33,430,473.48, a total of P14,925,969.21 or 45 percent remained unliquidated for one to five years contrary to the provisions of COA Circular 97-002 dated February 10, 1997; and  a total of P9,322,319.67 were granted to 23 accountable officers even if the previous cash advances have not been liquidated and accounted for in the books contrary with  Section 89 of Presidential Decree (PD) 1445. 

	

We recommended and Management agreed to:

	

a)	require the AOs to refund the excess balance of cash advance immediately or within the prescribed periods after completion/termination of the purpose thereof; 

	

b)	submit to the Audit Team proof of exhaustion of all administrative remedies taken by the Accountant in requiring the liquidation/settlement of cash advances in preparation for the filing of appropriate charges in case the accountable officers failed to comply; and



c)	ensure that all documentary/procedural requirements are complied with prior to the processing of the cash advance and that no cash advance shall be drawn unless the previous cash advance had been properly liquidated and taken up in the books.

	

3)		The balance of the Accounts Payable amounting to P172,062,246.24 as of December 31, 2020 is unreliable due to the inclusion of the unreverted amount of P10,557,729.17 representing the account outstanding for two years or more, contrary to EO No. 87 and Section 98 of PD No. 1445.   

	

	

	

We reiterated our recommendation and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant to revert to the Unappropriated Surplus of the General Fund the remaining payables, which are outstanding for two years and more, particularly pertaining to those accounts and funds for which the implementation of the programs/projects has been completed and accomplished.



4)	Cash and Receivables accounts’ balances amounting to P42,834,531.39 remained dormant or non-moving for more than five years due to lack of appropriate action taken despite previous audit recommendations to comply with COA Circular Nos. 97-001 and 2015-001 dated February 5, 1997 and January 29, 2015, respectively.



We recommended and Management agreed to require the Chief Accountant to:



	a)	conduct thorough analysis of the cash accounts, particularly pertaining to those accounts and funds, which are non-moving for more than five years; funds which are dormant and are no longer necessary for the attainment of the purposes for which the funds were established/received and/or the project implementation has been completed, terminated, cancelled or abandoned;



	b)	return the unutilized balances to the Source Agency/donors/financing entities in the case of grants or foreign-funded programs/projects wherein the attendant agreements require the return of unused balances or remit the same to the National Treasury; and 



	c)	request an authority from COA to write-off the receivables, which are dormant or remained outstanding for 10 years or more following the requirements stated under COA Circular No. 2016-005 dated December 19. 2016.

		

	

G)	Summary of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges at year end 



Audit suspension and disallowances amounting to P4,226,552,630.18 and P15,912,123.00, respectively were issued in CY 2020 to the agency.
