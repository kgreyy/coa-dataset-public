C. Scope and Objectives of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial accounts and operations of the LEDAC for the year 

ended December 31, 2020. The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of 

assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the financial 

statements;  (b) determine the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of 

compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations; (c) recommend agency’s 

improvement opportunities; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior 

years’ audit recommendations.  

 

 

D. Audit Methodology 
 

We adopted a risk-based audit approach in the audit of the financial statements of 

LEDAC and in the review of compliance with laws, rules and regulations.  The 

Audit Team which carried out the audit, among others, (i) examined financial and 



 

iii 

 

accounting procedures adopted by the LEDAC and other relevant documentation; (ii) 

assessed internal controls regulating financial operations  and carried out compliance 

testing for determining the extent of control in operation; (iii)  conducted substantive 

testing of a representative sample of selected transactions;  (iv) carried out review, on 

test check basis, of a number of contracts and transactions related to movements in 

balances of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses; and (v) conducted interviews 

and held discussions with the concerned staff  in the Central Office.  

 

The results of the audit were communicated to the Head of the Agency and the 

concerned officials through the issuance of Audit Observation Memoranda.   

 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered an unmodified opinion on the fairness of the presentation of 

LEDAC’s financial statements as at December 31, 2020.  

 

 

F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

Among the audit observations and corresponding recommendations discussed in 

Part II of this report, the significant observations are summarized as follows: 

 

1. Use of the same account/payor code with that of the National Economic and 
Development Authority-Central Office (NEDA-CO) for advances to the 

Procurement Service (PS) did not facilitate the reconciliation of the related 

accounts to determine the existence, accuracy and completeness of the balance of 

Due from National Government Agencies of P9,770.74 at year-end.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) request the PS the 

creation/assignment of a separate account/payor code and Party Ledger 

Card for the LEDAC to facilitate verification and reconciliation of balance of 

Due from National Government Agencies; and (b) coordinate with the PS for 

the reconciliation of the discrepancy in the related account balances. 

 

2. Non-preparation and non-submission of the semestral Report on the Physical 
Count of Inventories (RPCIs) for the current year  due to  the non-conduct of 

physical inventory-taking of office supplies did not enable  the reconciliation of 

the related Accounting and Property records, thus, the existence and accuracy of 

the balance of Office Supplies Inventory of P37,319.94 was not established. 

 

 We recommended and Management agreed to require the Asset Management 

Division to conduct the physical count of inventories and to prepare the 

RPCI semi-annually, and submit the report to the Accounting Division and 

the Audit Team on or before the prescribed deadline to facilitate the 

reconciliation of the related accounting and property records, among others. 



 

iv 

 

 

3. Presentation of valid due and demandable obligations with supporting documents 
totaling P67,120.71 recognized in the books as Due to Officers and Employees 

under Not Yet Due and Demandable column of the Financial Accountability 

Report (FAR) No. 1 instead of under Due and Demandable Obligations resulted in 

the misclassification of obligations therein. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Budget Officer to 

strictly classify under Due and Demandable Obligations of the FAR No. 1 

those valid obligations with complete documentations and for which goods or 

services have been delivered, rendered and accepted, and under Not Yet Due 

and Demandable, those obligations charged to prior year’s budget for which 

goods or services have not yet been delivered, rendered and accepted as of 

December 31 of the preceding year. 

 

These observations and recommendations were also discussed with the concerned 

Management officials in an exit conference conducted on March 8, 2021. 

Management views and comments were incorporated in the report, where 

appropriate.  

 

 

G. Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances, and Charges 
 

For CY 2020, there were no Notices of Suspension, Disallowance and Charge issued. 

 

The disallowance amounting to P160,200.00 as at year-end issued in CY 2013 for 

cash incentives granted to LEDAC Secretariat personnel by way of Cost Economy 

Measure Award (CEMA) was already affirmed with modification by the 

Commission Proper (CP) under Commission on Audit (COA) Decision No. 2017-

423 dated December 20, 2017. On September 27, 2018, the CP en banc issued a 

resolution denying the Motion for Reconsideration filed by the aggrieved parties, as 

there were no new matters raised to warrant reconsideration of the said COA 

Decision. In CY 2020, the CP Adjudication and Secretariat Support Services Sector 

issued Notice of Finality of Decision No. 2020-383 dated November 25, 2020 for the 

settlement of the accounts pursuant to Section 22.5 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 

dated September 15, 2009.  

 

 

H. Status of Implementation of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations 
 

In CY 2020, the four prior years’ audit recommendations were all implemented, 

details are discussed in Part III of this report.
