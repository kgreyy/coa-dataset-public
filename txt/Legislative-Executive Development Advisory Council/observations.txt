   OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 

Financial Audit 

 

Accounting Deficiency 

 

1. Use of the same account/payor code with that of the NEDA-CO for advances to 
the PS did not facilitate the reconciliation of the related accounts to determine 

the existence, accuracy and completeness of the balance of Due from National 

Government Agencies of  P9,770.74 at year-end.  
 

Section 6 (e), Chapter 19, Volume I of the Government Accounting Manual 

(GAM) on Qualitative Characteristics of Financial Reporting, states that an entity shall 

present information including accounting policies in a manner that meets the following 

qualitative characteristics enumerated in IPSAS 1: 

 

(e)  Reliability - reliable information is free from material error and 

bias, and can be depended on by users to represent faithfully that which 

it purports to represent or could reasonably be expected to represent. 

 

As of December 31, 2020, the general ledger (GL) balance of  Due from 

National Government Agencies of P9,770.74 pertains to the remaining balance of 

advance payments to the Procurement Service (PS) and deliveries  relative to the 

purchases of various office supplies in prior years.  There were no transactions made 

with the PS in CY 2020. 

  

Examination of documents on procurement of office supplies showed that the 

LEDAC had used the same account/payor code with that of the National Economic 

and Development Authority - Central Office (NEDA-CO) for advances to the PS for 

procurement of office supplies, such that the same will be co-mingled with the 

advances of the NEDA-CO to the PS.  

 

Verification of the NEDA-CO’s subsidiary ledger (SL) balance of Due from 

National Government Agencies of P12,642,861.08 as of December 31, 2019 was not 

reconciled with the PS balance of Due to NGAs of P7,605,147.64 or a discrepancy of 

P5,037,713.44.  Among of the reconciling items were the transactions pertaining to 

the LEDAC with a balance of P9,770.74.  

 

Inquiry with the Commission on Audit (COA) PS confirmed that the NEDA-

CO and LEDAC use the same account/payor code. The PS’s Party Ledger Card (PLC) 

provided to the Audit Team, which was only for the NEDA-CO showed a balance of 

P10,098,527.77 at year-end.  As of December 31, 2020, the PS has no PLC for the 

LEDAC separate from that of the NEDA-CO.  The PLC of the NEDA-CO also does 

not distinguish whether the advance payments, deliveries and refunds are for NEDA-

CO or LEDAC, thus, making verification and reconciliation of the accounts difficult.  



19 

 

 Since there was no separate account/payor code and PLC for the LEDAC, 

the reconciliation of the related account balances was not facilitated to determine the 

existence, completeness and accuracy of the balance of Due from National 

Government Agencies at year-end.  

  

 We recommended and Management agreed to: (a) request the PS the 

creation/assignment of a separate account/payor code and PLC for the LEDAC 

to facilitate verification and reconciliation of balance of Due from National 

Government Agencies; and (b) coordinate with the PS for the reconciliation of the 

discrepancy in the related account balances. 

 

The LEDAC Secretariat has coordinated with the PS thru a formal request 

dated February 26, 2021 for the creation of a separate account for the LEDAC, as well 

as the reconciliation of the related account balances.  A copy of the request 

acknowledged by the PS on March 4, 2021 was provided to the Audit Team.  

 
Non-preparation and submission of semestral RPCI  

 

2. Non-preparation and non-submission of the semestral RPCIs for the current 
year  due to  the non-conduct of physical inventory-taking of office supplies did 

not enable  the reconciliation of the related accounting and property records, 

thus, the existence and accuracy of the balance of Office Supplies Inventory of 

P37,319.94 was not established. 

 

 Section 17 (i), Chapter 8, Volume I of the GAM provides that the Report on 

the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) shall be used to report physical count of 

supplies by type of inventory as at a given date. It shows the balance of inventory 

items per card and per count and shortage/overage, if any. Item E of the RPCI, requires 

its submission to the COA Auditor concerned not later than July 31 and January 31 of 

each year for the first and second semesters, respectively. 

 

As of December 31, 2020, the Office Supplies Inventory has a balance of 

P37,319.94. However, the corresponding RPCIs as of June 30, 2020 and December 

31, 2020 were not submitted by the Property Division. 

 

According to the Property Officer, only an inventory of equipment  was 

conducted and no physical count of office supplies  had been made, thus, the  RPCIs 

as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020 were not prepared and submitted to the 

Accounting Division and the Audit Team as required. The Audit Team verbally 

required the Property Officer to conduct the physical count of inventories, and to 

prepare and submit the RPCI before the deadline of submission but the RPCI remained 

unsubmitted.  

 

In view of the non-preparation and non-submission of the RPCIs, the 

reconciliation of accounting and property records was not undertaken, thus, the  



20 

 

existence and accuracy of the balance of Office Supplies Inventory at year-end was not 

established. 

             

          We recommended and Management agreed to require the Asset 

Management Division to conduct the physical count of inventories and to prepare 

the RPCI semi-annually,  and submit the report to the Accounting Division and 

the Audit Team on or before the prescribed deadline to facilitate the 

reconciliation of the related accounting and property records, among others. 

   
Erroneous presentation of due and demandable obligations in FAR No. 1 

 

3. Presentation of valid due and demandable obligations with supporting 
documents totaling P67,120.71, recognized in the books as Due to Officers and 

Employees, under Not Yet Due and Demandable  column of  the FAR No. 1 

instead of under Due and Demandable Obligations resulted in the 

misclassification of obligations therein. 

 

COA-DBM-Joint Circular No. 2019-1 dated January 1, 2019 prescribed the 

guidelines relative to Budget and Financial Accountability Reports (BFARs). BFARs 

include the Statement of Appropriations, Allotments, Obligations, Disbursements and 

Balances (SAAODB) as Financial Accountability Report (FAR) No. 1. Columns 23 

to 24 of the FAR No. 1 show the balance of unpaid obligations for the period 

equivalent to the difference between columns 15 and 20, broken down into: Due and 

Demandable Obligations and Not Yet Due and Demandable Obligations. 

 

Section 5.6 of Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Circular No. 

2013-16 defines Not Yet Due and Demandable Obligations as National Government 

Agency (NGA)/Operating Unit (OU) obligations charged against prior years’ budget 

for which, goods, services, and projects are not yet delivered, rendered, nor 

completed/accepted as of December 31 of the preceding year. 

 

Verification of the FAR No. 1 revealed that the amount of P67,120.71 which 

pertains to the total valid and documented obligations due to LEDAC officers and 

employees for payments of claims and other personnel benefits recognized under Due 

to Officers and Employees were for services delivered/rendered and not for those 

charged against prior years’ budget for services not yet delivered/rendered as  of 

December 31 of the preceding year.  However, the said obligations were erroneously 

presented/reported under Not Yet Due and Demandable Obligations column of the 

FAR No. 1 instead of under Due and Demandable Obligations resulting in the 

misclassification of obligations presented therein.   

          

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Budget Officer 

to strictly classify under Due and Demandable Obligations of the FAR No. 1 those 

valid obligations with complete documentations and for which goods or services 

have been delivered, rendered and accepted, and under Not Yet Due and 

Demandable, those obligations charged to prior year’s budget for which goods 



21 

 

or services have not yet been delivered, rendered and accepted as of  December 

31 of the preceding year.  

 
Compliance with Other Mandatory Accounts/Areas 
 

4. COVID-19 Response and Recovery Interventions 
  

For CY 2020, the LEDAC had not received funds specifically for Coronavirus 

Disease 2019 (COVID-19)  response and/or recovery but had utilized its budget for 

related expenses. COVID-19-related expenses charged to Personnel Services 

amounted to P5,000.00. 

 

The results of audit of these COVID-related transactions are as follows: 

 

On the grant of hazard pay to employees during the ECQ 

 

Section 1 of Administrative Order (AO) No. 26 dated March 23, 2020 of the 

Office of the President authorized the NGAs to grant COVID-19 Hazard Pay to 

personnel who physically reported for work during the implementation of Enhanced 

Community Quarantine (ECQ) in their respective work stations, in an amount not 

exceeding P500.00 per day per person. 

 

Section 2 of the same AO provides the conditions on the grant of the COVID-

19 Hazard Pay and that the heads of government agencies may grant the COVID-19 

Hazard Pay to their personnel/workers without the need for further approval by the 

DBM, subject to the following guidelines and conditions:  

 

1. The personnel are occupying regular, contractual or casual positions, or are 
workers engaged through Contract of Service (COS), job order (JO), or 

other similar schemes; 

  

2. The personnel/workers have been authorized to physically report for work 
at their respective offices or work stations on the prescribed official 

working hours by the head of agency/office during the period of 

implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine measures in the area 

of such office or work station; and 

 

3. The total rate of the COVID-19 Hazard Pay shall be based on the number 
of days an employee/worker physically reports for work during the ECQ 

period using the formula under Section 1, which is P500 x No. of days 

physically reporting for work during the quarantine period. 

 

Review of the transactions recognized under Hazard Pay totaling P5,000.00  

for CY 2020 disclosed that the LEDAC granted COVID-19 hazard pay at P500/day 

to one permanent employee and one contractual employee totaling P1,500.00 and 

P3,500.00, respectively, who reported to office during the ECQ (March 18, 2020) 



22 

 

and Modified ECQ (MECQ) (May 22 and 28, 2020 and  August 4, 7, 11, 13 and  18, 

2020).   

 
5. Gender and Development (GAD) 
 

The LEDAC did not have any GAD programs/projects/activities (PPAs) 

considering that it only performs secretariat functions, and is composed of only three 

personnel. It has no separate GAD Plan and Budget so the LEDAC personnel  

participated in GAD-related activities conducted by  NEDA. 

 
6. Senior Citizens and Persons with Disability 

 

The LEDAC Secretariat had no PPAs intended for senior citizens and persons 

with disability considering that it only performs secretariat functions, and is composed 

of only three personnel. 

 
7. Tax Laws and Regulations, GSIS and Pag-IBIG Premium Contributions and 

Loan Amortization, and PhilHealth Premium Contributions 

 

In CY 2020, the LEDAC has complied with the withholding and remittances 

of mandatory deductions pursuant to the regulations issued by the Bureau of Internal 

Revenue (BIR), Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), Pag-IBIG and 

PhilHealth, as shown in the following Table 1:

8. GSIS Property Insurance Law 

 

For CY 2020, the LEDAC insured with the GSIS its 2014 Isuzu Crosswind 

Sportivo with plate no. SHR-954, which is its only insurable asset, with book value of 



23 

 

P160,714.38, for which a premium of P6,493.44 was paid in compliance with Republic 

Act No. 656, otherwise known as “Property Insurance Law”, as amended by 

Presidential Decree No. 245 dated July 13, 1973. 

 
9. Hiring of Casual, Job Orders and Contractual 

 

For CY 2020, the LEDAC has one contractual employee, Executive Assistant 

I, whose salaries and wages were funded from the Regular Fund and recognized under 

Salaries and Wages - Casual/Contractual.  The employee assumed office on May 22, 

2020. Specific activities or services which cannot be provided by the regular three 

employees such as the procurement, storage, and maintenance of office supplies and 

properties and arranged local travels, in conformity to  Section 41 of the General 

Appropriation Act of FY 2020, were performed by the said employee. The payments 

of salaries for the period May to December 2020 totaled P213,469.10,  including the 

mandatory deductions of P108,106.07 for BIR, GSIS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth.  

    
10. Status of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 

 

For CY 2020, there were no Notices of Suspension (NSs), Notice of 

Disallowance (NDs), and Notice of Charge (NCs) issued, as shown in Table 2:

The ND for P160,200.00 issued in CY 2013 for cash incentives granted to the 

LEDAC Secretariat personnel by way of Cost Economy Measure Award (CEMA) was 

already affirmed with modification by the Commission Proper (CP) per COA Decision 

No. 2017-423 dated December 20, 2017. However, the aggrieved parties filed a 

Motion for Reconsideration (MR) on January 31, 2018 for the reversal and/or 

modification of the said COA Decision.  The CP en banc issued a resolution on 

September 27, 2018, which denied the MR, there being no new matters raised to 

warrant reconsideration of the COA Decision.   

 

Moreover, in CY 2020, Notice of Finality of Decision No. 2020-383 dated 

November 25, 2020 was issued by the CP Adjudication and Secretariat Support 

Services Sector which held liable the officials who approved/authorized/certified the 

payments of CEMA to the LEDAC personnel in the amount of P160,200.00 and 

excluded from liability those who were mere recipients of the CEMA incentive.
