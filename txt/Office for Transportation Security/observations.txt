A. FINANCIAL AUDIT  
 

Accounting Errors and Improper Accounting Treatment of Transactions 

 

There were no material misstatements found in audit of the financial statements of the OTS. 

Accounting errors and improper accounting treatment of transactions that are considered 

departure from the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs) totaling to 

P31.930 million as summarized in Annex A have been adjusted in the OTS’s books of 

accounts as of year-end.  

 
Accounting   Deficiencies Affecting the Reliability of Account Balances 
 

1. Accounting deficiencies affecting some accounts by the amount of 
P345,381,499.04 were noted due to the failure of agency officials concerned to 

implement the controls required under existing regulations in the 

reconciliation and validation of account balances. Based on the 

possible/potential effects of the various accounting deficiencies, the reported 

balances of the affected accounts could not be relied upon.  

 

1.1. Section 6, paragraph (e) Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual for 
National Government Agencies (GAM for NGAs) Volume 1 on Qualitative 

Characteristics of Financial Reporting states that an entity shall present information 

including accounting policies in a manner that meets reliable information which is 

free from material error and bias, and can be depended on by users to represent 

faithfully that which it purports to represent or could reasonably expected to 

represent.  

 

1.2. Audit disclosed that there were accounting deficiencies in the financial accounts 
noted that require further analysis, reconciliation, physical count/verification, 

coordination and future corrective actions as these have possible effects on the 

accuracy and reliability of the reported account balances in the aggregate amount 

of P1,088,707,603.72. Table 1 below presents the accounts affected and the 

deficiencies noted, together with the corresponding amounts compromised.

a)  Unreliable Inventories account balances due to unreconciled difference between 

the General Ledger balances and the RPCI - P10,939,808.57 

 

The accuracy and reliability of the reported year-end balances of Inventories 

aggregating to P32,783,633.35 could not be ascertained in view of the 

unreconciled difference of P10,939,808.57 between the General Ledger 

balances and the Report on the Physical Count of Inventory (RPCI) which is 

largely attributed to the non-maintenance of complete Supplies Ledger Cards 

(SLCs) and Stock Cards (SCs) for semi-expendable inventories. 

 

1.3. Section 13, Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I requires physical count of 
inventory to be conducted semi-annually for checking the integrity of property 

custodianship. Section 17 further prescribes the use of the RPCI to report the 

physical count of supplies by type of inventory as at a given date, and showing the 

balance of inventory items per card and per count and shortage/overage, if any. The 

report includes semi-expendable property wherein the issue is covered by the 

Inventory Custodian Slip (ICS). 

 

1.4. The accuracy and reliability of the reported year-end balances of Inventories 
aggregating to P32,783,633.35 could not be ascertained in view of the unreconciled 

difference of P10,939,808.57 between the General Ledger (GL) balances and the 

RPCI which is largely attributed to the non-maintenance of Supplies Ledger Cards 

(SLC) and Stock Cards (SCs) for semi-expendable inventories. 

 

1.5. Comparison of the reported balances per GL maintained by the Accounting Section 
and the RPCI submitted by the Supply Section disclosed unreconciled difference of 

P10,939,808.57  broken down as follows:

Total  32,783,633.35 22,090,992.14 10,939,808.57 

 

1.6. Out of the unreconciled difference of P10,939,808.57, it was noted that semi-
expendable inventory items amounting to P2,057,190.00 were recorded in the GL 

but were not reported in the RPCI. Neither were there SCs nor SLCs maintained by 

the Supply Section and Accounting Section.   

 

1.7. The Supply Section explained that the semi-expendable items were not reported in 
the RPCI because the items were already issued and there were no SCs maintained 

to support the record of issuances. Likewise, the Accounting Section did not prepare 

the SLCs for semi-expendable inventories.  

 

1.8. Verification also showed that Other Supplies and Materials Inventory account is 
largely comprised of spare parts for security screening equipment, common 

janitorial supplies and electrical supplies. Out of the GL balance of P30,504,341.61, 

only inventory items amounting to P18,777,880.86 are supported by  SLCs and SC, 

hence full reconciliation of both records could not be undertaken.  

 

1.9. Moreover,  our audit  disclosed that the RPCI for the 1st  and 2nd  semesters of CY 
2020 were submitted by the Supply Section on December 12, 2020 and February 2, 

2021, respectively, consequently delaying the reconciliation of the Inventory 

accounts balances between the GL and the actual physical count. Management 

commented that henceforth, other approaches and strategies will be adopted to 

ensure timely and efficient conduct and submission of RPCI.  It bears to mention 

that the OTS is currently in the process of installing an inventory system to facilitate 

the reconciliation of Inventory and PPE accounts.   

 

1.10. The non-maintenance of complete SLCs and SCs and delay in the submission of 
RPCI prevented the effective and timely reconciliation of the Accounting and 

Supply records resulting in unreliable balance of Inventories Account. 

 

1.11. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting and 
Supply Sections to maintain SLCs and SCs and regularly reconcile both 

records to ensure accuracy and correctness of the year-end balances of 

Inventories accounts.

b)  Unreliable PPE balance due to unreconciled discrepancy between the GL balances 

and the RPCPPE - P326,911,415.71 

 

The accuracy and reliability of the reported year-end balances of various 

Plant, Property and Equipment (PPE) aggregating to P1,866,026,776.43 could 

not be ascertained in view of the unreconciled difference between the balances 

per  General Ledger (GL)  and per  Report on the Physical Count of Plant, 

Property and Equipment (RPCPPE) of P326,911,415.71 which is largely 

attributed to the  i) unrecorded PPEs either  in the GL or  in the  RPCPPE, 

and ii) failure to regularly  update the Property, Plant and Equipment Ledger 

Cards (PPELCs). Moreover, lapses in the preparation and submission of 

Inventory Inspection and Report of Unserviceable Properties (IIRUP) were 

also noted. 

 

1.12. Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I provides that the Property 
and Supply Office/Unit shall maintain Property Card (PC) for each class of PPE in 

their custody to account for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per 

PC shall be reconciled with PPE Ledger Card (PPELC) maintained by the 

Accounting Division/Unit. Section 38 of the same chapter of the GAM for NGAs 

requires the conduct of periodic physical count of PPE, which shall be done 

annually and presented in the RPCPPE as at December 31 of each year.  

 

1.13. The accuracy and reliability of the reported year-end balances of various PPE 
aggregating to P1,866,026,776.43 could not be ascertained in view of the 

unreconciled difference between the balances per GL and per RPCPPE of 

P326,911,415.71 which is largely attributed to the  i) unrecorded PPEs either  in the 

GL or  in the  RPCPPE, and ii) failure to regularly  update the PPELCs. Moreover, 

lapses in the preparation and submission of Inventory Inspection and Report of 

Unserviceable Properties (IIRUP) were also noted.  

 

1.14. Comparison of the year-end balances of various items of PPE per GL maintained 
by the Accounting Section and the RPCPPE submitted by the Property Section 

disclosed the following unreconciled total difference of P326,911,415.71, broken 

down as follows:

1.15. Verification of the Accounting and Property records revealed that the unreconciled 
difference of P326,911,415.71 is largely attributed to the following: 

 

i. Unrecorded PPEs either in the Accounting Books or in the RPCPPE or 
Property Cards 

 

1.16. Examination of records revealed that various PPE were either not recorded in 
Accounting books or in the RPCPPE or PC.  Discrepancies between the balances 

in the GL and PPELC were also noted.   Sample of these are as follows:

1.17. Inquiry with the Accounting and the Property Sections disclosed that the 
reconciliation of records between the Accounting and Property Sections is still on-

going. The concerned personnel commented that the difference in the year-end 

balance can be attributed to improper account classification of various PPE items 

by both Sections.  



44 

 

ii. Failure to regularly update the PPELCs and PCs 
 

1.18. Section 42, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I provides that the Chief 
Accountant shall maintain PPELC for each category of PPE. The PPELC shall be 

kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated life, 

depreciation, impairment, issue/transfer/disposal, repair history and other 

information about the property. For check and balance, the Property Section shall 

likewise maintain PC for PPE in their account for the receipt and disposition of the 

same. The balance per PC shall be reconciled with PPELC maintained by the 

Accounting Division/Unit. They shall also be reconciled with other property 

records. 

 

1.19. Validation of records and interview with the Accounting Section personnel revealed 
that they are still in the process of preparing and updating the PPELCs. Record 

shows that out of the P1,884,227,480.08 worth of PPEs, only P825,550,396.61 or 

43.81 percent thereof have updated PPELCs. 

 

1.20. The failure of the Accounting and Property Section to regularly update the PPELCs 
and PCs contributed in the difficulty of reconciling the accounting records with the 

property records. 

 

1.21. The Accounting and the Property Sections commented that the preparation and 
updating of the PPELCs and PCs are on-going. 

 

iii)       Lapses in the preparation of IIRUP  

 

1.22. Section 40, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs Volume I prescribes in part that a 
PPE is said to be unserviceable if it is no longer capable of providing the entity with 

future economic benefits. All unserviceable property shall be reported in the IIRUP.  

 

1.23. Verification of IIRUP for CY 2020 which was submitted on May 6, 2021, revealed 
that PPE items for disposal lack complete details such as the unit and total cost of 

the PPE items, Accumulated Depreciation, Accumulated Impairment Loss and 

Carrying amount. The disposal and appraisal values were not also indicated. The 

incomplete details in IIRUP could hamper the timely disposal of the unserviceable 

properties.  

 

1.24. It bears mentioning that the foregoing observations on the PPE account were 
already brought to Management’s attention in previous year’s audit but no adequate 

action had been taken to address such observations in CY 2020. Management 

commented that the Accounting and Property Sections have started their 

reconciliation as early as May 2020 but remained uncompleted because of the 

restrictions brought about by the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, 

thus, the same observations are reiterated hereto. 

 



45 

 

1.25. Moreover, it is emphasized that the OTS should adhere to COA Circular No. 2020-
006 dated January 31, 2020 that prescribes the guidelines and procedures in the 

conduct of physical count of PPE, recognition of PPE items found at the station, 

and disposition of non-existing/missing PPE items, for the one-time cleansing of 

PPE account balances of government agencies to establish PPE balances that are 

verifiable as to existence, condition and accountability. 

 

1.26. This is to address the existence of enormous amounts of discrepancies in the PPE 
account balance of government agencies which has become a perennial issue and 

has compromised the accuracy of PPE balances presented in the financial 

statements. 

 

1.27. The failure of the officials concerned to implement the controls such as, regular 
updating of property records and timely submission of property reports required 

under existing issuances to facilitate reconciliation and validation has a significant 

impact on the PPE accounts, thus rendering the year-end PPE account balances 

unreliable. 

 

1.28. The Management commented that they are currently in the process of installing a 
cloud based inventory management system developed by a third party contractor 

which is currently in  the  user testing phase  to facilitate the reconciliation of 

Inventory and PPE accounts. They further reported that the system is already more 

than 90.00 percent completed. 

 

1.29. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accounting and the 
Property Sections to: 

 

a) immediately reconcile their respective records and direct the Accounting 
Section to prepare the necessary adjusting entries resulting from the said 

reconciliation to ensure correctness of year-end account balances of 

various PPE items; 

 

b) hasten the preparation and updating of PPELCs and IIRUPs; and 
 

c) comply with the guidelines and procedures prescribed under COA 
Circular No. 2020-006 for the one-time clearing of PPE account balances 

to establish the accuracy of the PPE balances in the financial statements.  

 

d)  Unaccounted amount of year-end balances of Inter-Agency Payables – 

P7,530,274.76 

 

1.30. The total balances of Inter-Agency Payable accounts in the financial statements 
include unaccounted amounts as at year-end as presented in Table No. 5 and 

explained in the succeeding paragraphs.

Total 10,645,821.70 7,530,274.76 

 

1.31. Due to BIR refers to the unremitted taxes withheld from employees and suppliers.  
Audit disclosed that the OTS withheld taxes amounting to P30,127,821.38, 

inclusive of the prior year’s balance, and remitted the amount of P25,326,116.39 

during CY 2020, with a year-end balance per books of P4,801,704.99. Of this 

amount, P1,703,177.43 was remitted in CY 2021 thereby leaving an unaccounted 

balance of  P3,098,527.56. It was noted that the amount pertains to the unaccounted 

prior years’ transactions that was forwarded as beginning balance in CY 2020, thus 

affecting the reliability of the year-end balance of the Due to BIR account.  

  

1.32. Due to GSIS refers to the unremitted employees’ contribution and loan payments 
to GSIS. Audit disclosed that the OTS withheld contributions and loan payments 

amounting to P84,048,475.82, inclusive of the prior year’s balance and remitted the 

amount of P80,823,614.12 during CY 2020, with a year-end balance per books of 

P3,224,861.70. Of this amount, P454,346.06  was remitted in CY 2021 thereby 

leaving an unaccounted balance of P2,770,515.64. It was noted that the amount 

pertains to the unaccounted prior years’ transactions that was forwarded as 

beginning balance in CY 2020, thus affecting the reliability of the year-end balance 

of the Due to GSIS account. 

 

1.33. Due to Pag-IBIG refers to the unremitted employees’ contribution and loan 
amortizations to Pag-IBIG. Audit disclosed that the OTS withheld contributions 

and loan amortizations amounting to P19,079,343.63, inclusive of the prior year’s 

balance and remitted the amount of P18,521,662.30, with a year-end balance per 

books of P557,681.33. Of this amount, P274,176.05 was remitted during CY 2021 

thereby leaving an unaccounted balance of P283,505.28. It was noted that the 

amount pertains to the unaccounted prior years’ transactions that was forwarded as 

beginning balance in the CY 2020, thus affecting the reliability of the year-end 

balance of the Due to Pag-IBIG account. 

 

1.34. Due to PhilHealth refers to the unremitted employees’ share in premium 
contribution to PhilHealth. Audit disclosed that the OTS withheld share in premium 

contribution amounting to P11,424,828.92, inclusive of the prior year’s balance and 

remitted the amount of P9,363,255.24, with a year-end balance per books of 

P2,061,573.68. Of this amount, P683,847.40 was remitted during CY 2021 thereby 

leaving an unaccounted balance of P1,377,726.28. It was noted that the amount 



47 

 

pertains to the unaccounted prior years’ transactions that was forwarded as 

beginning balance in the CY 2020, thus affecting the reliability of the year-end 

balance of the Due to PhilHealth account. 

  

1.35. Management commented that a team had already been constituted to conduct the 
verification of the unaccounted amounts, but the verification and reconciliation of 

records have yet to be completed, hence, the same remains a deficiency as at year-

end. 

 

1.36. It bears to emphasize that had the Management maintained subsidiary ledgers, 
schedules and other monitoring tools in the past and performed verification and 

periodic reconciliation of prior years’ outstanding balances, the unreconciled 

differences could have been addressed early on. 

 

1.37. We recommended and Management agreed to fast-track the reconciliation 
and verification of unpaid contributions and taxes and to immediately remit 

the same to avoid penalties and surcharges that may be imposed due to late 

remittances as well as to enable employees to avail of the privileges and benefits 

accruing to members of good standing.  
  

 

B. COMPLIANCE AUDIT 
 

Utilization of Budget/Allotments and Cash Allocations 

 

2. Of the total allotments of P1,312,070,162.59 received by the OTS in CY 2020, 
P1,229,819,339.03 or 93.73 percent thereof was obligated, leaving an 

unobligated balance of P82,250,823.56 as at year end. Disbursement rate was 

at 72.87 percent or in the total amount of P896,157,298.52.  Moreover, 

P249,244,708.00 was obligated and none was disbursed from the allotments for 

continuing appropriations of P250,320,117.59 resulting in the reversion of 

P1,075,409.59 to the unappropriated Surplus of the General Fund which 

indicates that the full utilization of the allotments was not  fully attained.  

 

a) Utilization of Budget 

 

3.1 Review of OTS’ FAR No. 1 for CY 2020 showed that out of the total appropriations 
of P1,316,871,766.59, inclusive of the extended amount in CY 2019, the amount of 

P1,312,070,162.59 or 99.64 percent was received by the OTS as budget/allotments 

wherein P1,229,819,339.03 or 93.73 percent was obligated and P82,250,823.56 or 

6.27 percent remained unobligated as of December 31, 2020. Details are shown in

3.5 Further, as shown in the preceding table, P82,250,823.56  or   six  point twenty 
seven (6.27) percent of the total allotments remained unobligated as at year end 

wherein P305,666.40 was extended and P81,945,157.16 was reverted to the 

General Fund. 

 

3.6 Inquiry with Management disclosed that the unobligated balance under each 
category was attributed to the following: 

 

  Personal Services - salaries and allowances of personnel who  resigned  during 
the year; 

 MOOE  - limited traveling expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic 



49 

 

 Capital Outlay -delayed release of SARO on September 14, 2020, hence late 
implementation of project 

 

b) Utilization and Reversion of NCAs  

 

3.7 The OTS utilized P1,076,194,973.75 or 95.58 percent of the total Notice of Cash 
Allocations (NCAs) received of  P1,125,980,108.00 with P49,785,134.25 reverted 

to the unappropriated Surplus of the General Fund pursuant to DBM Circular Letter 

No. 2019-3 dated January 4, 2019. 

 

3.8 Item No. 1 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2019-3 dated January 4, 2019 states that 
“To ensure the timely implementation of programs and projects, disbursement 

authorization documents are issued to make cash available within the scheduled 

program/activity/project implementation period as reflected in the corresponding 

DBM-evaluated Monthly Disbursement Programs (MDPs) submitted by agencies.” 

 

3.9 Moreover, Item Nos. 2.1, 2.2.3 and 2.3 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2019-3 provide 
the following policies and procedures to be observed beginning the first quarter of 

CY 2019: 

 

“2.1 All NCA releases for Regular MDS Sub-Accounts, to be credited for any 

month, whether part of the comprehensive releases or constituting 

additional NCA releases, shall continue to be valid until the last working 

day of the 3rd month of the quarter covered. xxx 

 

2.2.3 The MDS-GSB shall automatically credit any unutilized NCA 

corresponding to the book balance at the end of the month, to the 

immediately succeeding month within the same quarter. 

 

2.3 It is understood that all NCA balances of regular MDS-Accounts at the 

end of each quarter are considered lapsed after the last working hour of 

said quarter.” 

 

3.11 Further review of the NCAs received by the OTS during CY 2020 disclosed the

3.12 Shown differently, the pie chart below viewed the graphical representation of the 
cash allocation received and utilized in CY 2020. 

 

3.13 It can be noted in Table No. 7 that the OTS satisfactorily utilized its NCAs at 95.56 
percent for CY 2020. 

 

3.14 We recommended and Management agreed to consider other approaches, 
ways and strategies to ensure the optimum utilization of its allotments and 

NCAs such as adequate planning and monitoring of the agency’s programs 

and projects and the timely execution of all planned activities despite the 

challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

 

Grant of monetary assistance to Senior Citizen employees of OTS 

 

4. The OTS paid monetary assistance to 106 Senior Citizen (SC) employees 
amounting to P227,850.18 which is not among the Standard Allowances and 

Benefits provided under the Total Compensation Framework per Item (4) (f) 

(g) and (h) of the Senate and House of Representatives Joint Resolution No. 4, 

series of 2009 and Republic Act (RA) No. 11466, hence, considered 

unauthorized and irregular expenditures under Section 3.1 of COA Circular 

No. 2012-003. 

 

4.1 Under Section 3.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-003 dated October 29, 2012, irregular 
expenditure signifies expenditure incurred without adhering to established rules, 

regulations, procedural guidelines, policies, principles or practices that have gained 

recognition in laws. Irregular expenditures are incurred if funds are disbursed 

without conforming with prescribed usages and rules of discipline.  There is no 

observance of an established pattern, course, and mode of action, behavior, or 

conduct in the incurrence of an irregular expenditure. A transaction conducted in a 

manner that deviates or departs from, or which does not comply with standards set 

is deemed irregular. A transaction which fails to follow or violates appropriate rules 

of procedure is, likewise, irregular.

4.2 Items 4 (f), (g), (h) of the Senate and House of Representatives Joint Resolution       
No. 4 dated June 17, 2009 enumerates the standard bonuses, allowances, benefits, 

and incentives given to all employees across agencies at prescribed rates, 

guidelines, rules and regulations and does not include the payment of monetary 

assistance to SC employees. 

 

4.3 Section 6 of RA No. 11466 or the Salary Standardization Law of 2019 provides that 
the Total Compensation Framework established under Item (4) of Joint Resolution 

No. 4, series of 2009, consisting of (a) Basic Salaries including Step Increments; 

(b) Standard Allowances and Benefits; (c) Specific-Purpose Allowances and 

Benefits; and (d) Incentive shall continue to be adopted. 

 

4.4 Audit of disbursement vouchers (DVs) disclosed that payments of monetary 
assistance were granted to 106 senior citizen employees of the OTS and recorded 

under the Other Maintenance and Operating Expenses account. Details are 

presented in Table No. 8.

4.5 Furthermore, it was informed that the amount used in the payment of monetary 
assistance for the 106 Senior Citizen employees of the OTS at P2,149.53 each was 

in lieu of the medical tools and consumables such as, face masks, face shields, 

alcohol, sanitizer and non-prescription medicines. 

 

4.6 The grant of monetary assistance to SC employees was not among the Standard 
Allowances and Benefits provided under the Total Compensation Framework per 

Item (4) (f) (g) and (h) of the Senate and House of Representatives Joint Resolution 

No. 4, series of 2009 and Republic Act No. 11466. There was also no expressed 

authority provided under RA No. 11469 for the grant thereof, thus, considered 

unauthorized and irregular expenditures under Section 3.1  of COA Circular 

No.2012-003 dated October 29, 2012. 

 

4.7 Management commented that the grant of assistance in the form of cash was 
prudent, more responsive, practicable and beneficial to the Senior Citizens who are 

assigned in the outlying airport stations. It would give the Senior Citizens the 

freedom to buy the medical tools and consumables they really need and minimize 

the distribution chain and transfer costs. 
 

4.8 Management further commented that the distribution of monetary assistance to 
Senior Citizens is a reasonable mechanism to achieve one of the objectives 

enunciated in RA No. 11494 or the Bayanihan to Recover As One Act, to reduce 

https://lia.coa.gov.ph/documents/16603?search_param=medical+allowance#sdfootnote23sym


52 

 

the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the socioeconomic well-being of all Filipinos 

through the provision of assistance, subsidies, and other forms of socio-economic 

relief. 
 

4.9 The Audit Team, however, maintains its position that the grant of medical 
allowance totaling to P227,850.18 or P2,149.53 per Senior Citizen employees of 

the OTS was not within the purview of RA No. 11466 or the SSL of 2019 

specifically Section 6 on Compensation, which reiterated that the Total 

Compensation Framework under Item (4) of the House of Representatives and 

Senate of the Philippines Joint Resolution No. 4, series of 2009 shall continue to be 

adopted. Any payment of benefits beyond the scope of RA No. 11466 should be 

with the prior approval of the President. Absent such approval, the payment of the 

monetary assistance to the OTS 106 Senior Citizen officers and personnel is 

therefore unauthorized and irregular under Section 3.1 of COA Circular No. 2012-

003 dated October 29, 2012. 
 

4.10 We recommended Management to require the recipients of the monetary 
assistance to refund the amount received.  
 

 

Lapses in the grant, utilization and liquidation of cash advances 
 

5. Of the reported balances of Advances to Special Disbursing Officers  (SDOs) 
and Advances to Officers and Employees accounts aggregating P4,269,844.77 

as of December 31, 2020, the amount of P1,365,827.85 aged more than 30 days, 

remained unliquidated  due to:  (a)  failure of the SDOs to liquidate special 

purpose cash advances as soon as the purpose for which it was given has been 

served, and  (b)  failure of the officers and employees to observe the prescribed 

timelines in liquidation of travel advances. Moreover, additional cash 

advances were granted to Accountable Officers (AOs) despite non-liquidation 

of previous cash advances which is a practice not in keeping with Section 89 of 

Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 and COA Circular No. 97-002 dated 

February 10, 1997. 

 

5.1 Section 89 of PD No. 1445 prescribes the limitations on cash advances which states 
that, “No cash advance shall be given unless for a legally authorized specific 

purpose. A cash advance shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as the purpose 

for which it was given has been served. No additional cash advance shall be allowed 

to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first 

settled or a proper accounting thereof is made.”       
 

5.2 The foregoing rules and regulations were reiterated in Items 4.1.1 to 5.1.3 of COA 
Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1997. Said Circular also prescribes the 

timelines on liquidation of cash advances as shown in Table No. 9.

5.5 As shown in the above Table, the year-end balances of Advances to Officers and 
Employees accounts for Funds 101 and 152 pertain to cash advances granted to 

various OTS employees intended for traveling expenses while Advances to SDO 

pertain to cash advances granted for special activities and undertakings. 

 

5.6 Advances to OE in the total amount of P781,473.51 pertains to 
unliquidated/unsettled cash advances for traveling expenses. Of this amount, 



54 

 

P103,178.00 was for travel expenses for December 2019 to April 2020 which had 

remained unliquidated as of December 31, 2020. The balance of P678,295.51 

pertains to outstanding cash advances for traveling expenses aged more than one 

(1) year. Pursuant to Item 5.1.3 of COA Circular No. 97-002, cash advances for 

local travels should have been liquidated within thirty (30) days after return to the 

permanent official station or the soonest possible time. 

 

5.7 On the other hand, Advances to SDOs pertain to unliquidated/unsettled cash 
advances for special and time-bound activities. The amount of P367,517.80 pertains 

to cash advances that were granted for the purchase of Anti-COVID essentials for 

use of Human Resource Division personnel, for expenses on Dangerous Goods 

Awareness Training, Tool Kit Development Workshop, and repair and maintenance 

of OTS Training Room. Also, the amount of P207,563.00 pertains to cash advances 

granted in the early months of CY 2020 for the purchase of helpdesk kits, food 

packs and gasoline for Motor Vehicle with Plate Number SJT-228. The remaining 

balance of P9,273.50 represents unliquidated advances for representation and 

gasoline allocation in prior years. Pursuant to Item 4.1.3 of COA Circular No. 97-

002, special purpose cash advances should be liquidated as soon as the purpose for 

which it was given has been served.               

 

5.8 Although a huge amount of prior year’s cash advances was already liquidated in 
CY 2020, the AOs with cash advances granted during the year failed to liquidate 

on time despite prior year’s audit recommendation. The failure to liquidate cash 

advances has caused the accumulation of balances of the account Advances to OE 

and Advances to SDO. 

 

5.9 It was also observed that some AOs with long outstanding cash advances had 
already resigned and some were separated or no longer connected with the OTS; 

hence, there is the risk that the cash advances may no longer be liquidated and the 

unused amounts may no longer be collected. 

 

5.10 It bears to emphasize that it is the responsibility of the AOs to liquidate and settle 
their cash advances on or before the prescribed due dates of liquidation and there is 

a need for   the Accountant to monitor and/or   regularly update and notify the AOs 

on the timely liquidation of their accounts to avoid the accumulation of balances in 

the books of accounts especially when the purposes of the cash advances have 

already been served and the activities were already undertaken. 

5.11 Moreover, review of the Report on the Status of Unliquidated Cash Advances as of 
December 31, 2020 disclosed that 14 OTS employees with outstanding cash 

advances were granted with additional cash advances.  
 

5.12 The granting of additional cash advances to OTS employees with outstanding and 
unliquidated cash advances is a blatant disregard of the above-cited regulation. 

 

5.13 For control and monitoring purposes in the grant of additional cash advance, a 
certification from the Accountant that previous cash advances have been liquidated 



55 

 

and accounted for in the books should be required prior to the grant of a cash 

advance, otherwise, the Accountant shall not process any additional cash advances 

to officers and employees with outstanding cash advances. 

 

5.14 This observation was already brought to Management’s attention in previous year’s 
audit but no steps were undertaken as of date to address said observations. 

 

5.15 We reiterated our prior year’s audit recommendation and Management 
agreed to instruct: 
 

a) the concerned officials and Accountable Officers to strictly comply with  
Section 89 of PD No. 1445 and  paragraph 5 of  COA Circular No. 97-

002 dated February 10, 1997 on the limitation and  liquidation of cash 

advances, respectively;  and 
 

b) the Chief Accountant to monitor strictly the timely liquidation of cash 
advances by regularly issuing notices or demand letters to AOs to 

immediately settle their accounts, otherwise, the Audit Team will be 

constrained to issue the Notice of Suspension requiring the submission of  

liquidation of the long outstanding cash advances. 

 

 

Delayed submission of financial and budgetary documents and purchase orders 

 

6. Submission of financial statements, budgetary and financial accountability 
reports, contracts and purchase orders (POs), including the supporting 

documents, were delayed by five (5) to 365 days reckoned from the prescribed 

period, hence, timely review of financial transactions could not be undertaken. 

 

a) Non-submission of financial statements, budgetary reports and financial 

accountability reports/records within the prescribed timeline 
 

6.1 Section 122 of PD No. 1445 states that, “Whenever deemed necessary in the 
exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it 

require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, disbursing 

officers, administrative or personnel officers and other responsible officials of the 

various agencies to submit trial balances, physical inventory reports, current 

plantilla of personnel, and such other reports as may be necessary for the exercise 

of its functions. Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit the 

documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the suspension 

of payment of their salaries until they shall have complied with the requirements of 

the Commission.” 

 

6.2 Further, Section 7.1 of the 2009 Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of 
Accounts provides the Responsibility of the Agency Head which reads in part, “The 

head of the agency, who is primarily responsible for all government funds and 



56 

 

property pertaining to his agency, shall ensure that the required financial and other 

reports and statements are submitted by the concerned agency officials in such form 

and within the period prescribed by the Commission.” 

 

6.3 Verification of records on the OTS’s submission of financial, budgetary reports., 
RPCI, RPCPPE and related records and documents to the Audit Team disclosed 

delays ranging from five (5) to 365 days.

6.4 Further audit disclosed that the OTS Management failed to completely submit the 
DVs, Journal Vouchers, and supporting documents within the 10th day after the end 

of each month as prescribed in Section 12, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs 

Volume I.   

  

b) Non-submission of Contracts/POs within prescribed timeline 
 

6.5 Section 3.1.1 of COA Circular No. 2009-001 dated February 12, 2009 provides that 
“Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government 

or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-

owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract 

and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation 

shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned. In case of agencies 

audited on an engagement basis, submission of a copy of the contract and its 

supporting documents shall be to the Auditor of the mother agency or parent 

company, as the case may be.” 

 

6.6 Verification disclosed that during CY 2020, the OTS Management was also unable 
to submit contracts and POs with their supporting documents within the five days

6.5 The delayed submission of the aforementioned reports, POs and their supporting 

documents affected the timely review of the financial transactions and assessment 

of the Budget and Cash Utilization of the OTS.  

 

6.6 Management commented that delays were due to lack of personnel complement and 
the pandemic situation which led to imposition of skeleton workforce.  

 

6.7 The Audit Team is cognizant of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic 
which adversely affected the timely submission of reports due to limited workforce 

physically reporting to office.  However, Management should have considered 

other approaches and strategies to still ensure the timely submission of reports 

despite the limited work force.   It also bears to emphasize that this is a reiteration 

of prior year’s observations which was not fully addressed by Management. 

 

6.8 We recommended and Management agreed, henceforth, to comply with the 
prescribed period of submission of financial/budgetary statements/reports, 

contracts and POs, together with complete and relevant supporting 

documents, for the timely review and evaluation thereof by the Audit Team. 
 

 

Excessive payment of service fee – P376,000.00 

 

7 The four (4) percent service fee paid to the PS-DBM on the Supply, Delivery, 
Installation, Testing and Commissioning of Final Check Type Dual View 

Baggage X-Ray Machine with Tray Return System and Walk Thru Metal 

Detector is excessive by P376,000.00 due to erroneous computation by OTS. 

 



59 

 

7.1 Audit disclosed that on June 26 2019, the OTS entered into a Memorandum of 
Agreement (MOA) with the PS-DBM for the procurement of Final Check Type 

Dual View Baggage X-Ray Machine with Tray Return System and Walk Thru 

Metal Detector with an Approved Budget Cost (ABC) of P233,200,000.00 as 

reflected in the OTS’s CY 2019 Annual Procurement Plan. 

 

7.2 Paragraph 3.1, Article 3 of the MOA stipulates, “a service fee of four percent (4%) 
on the basis of the contract award price shall be imposed for services rendered by 

PS, which shall accrue to PS after the contract for the Project is signed by the OTS. 

In the event that the bid or proposal, and ultimately the contract award price is zero 

pesos (P0.00), the Service Fee shall be based on the Approved Budget for the 

Contract as published.” 

 

7.3 Verification disclosed that on September 30, 2019, Purchase Order No. 2019-09-
064 with a contract price of P223,800,000.00 and the Notice to Proceed were issued 

by the OTS to the Defense and Protection System Phil., Inc. (DPSPI) for the Supply, 

Delivery, Installation, Testing and Commissioning of final check type Dual View 

Baggage X-Ray Machine with Tray Return System and Walk Thru Metal Detector 

under BAC Resolution No. BACX-2091-09-001.   

 

7.4 On October 9, 2019, the PS-DBM billed the OTS the amount of P8,969,230.77 for 
the four (4) percent service fee rendered as the Procuring Agent in the procurement 

of the above mentioned item. On May 14, 2020, the OTS paid PS-DBM the amount 

of P9,328,000.00 under Official Receipt Number 207786. However, both the billed 

amount and the paid amount were incorrect and the payment was excessive by 

P376,000.00 as re-computed below:

7.5 The audited amount was computed based on the contract cost as prescribed in 
paragraph 3.1 of the MOA and not based on the ABC.   

 

7.6 We recommended and Management agreed to instruct the Accountant to 
coordinate with the PS-DBM on the recovery of the excess payment of 

P376,000.00 by offsetting said amount in future transactions with the latter   

and to make the necessary adjusting entry thereof.

Non-compliance with RA No. 9184 and its Revised Implementing Rules and Regulation 

 

8 The OTS was not fully compliant with the provisions of RA No. 9184 and its 
2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) in view of the 

deficiencies noted in the review of various contracts on the procurement of 

goods and services amounting to P5,801,469.78. 
 

8.1 RA No. 9184 otherwise known as the Government Procurement Reform Act and 
its RIRR was enacted to ensure that all procurement of the National Government, 

its departments, bureaus, offices and agencies shall be governed by the principles 

of transparency in the procurement process and implementation, employs 

competitiveness, streamlined, and follows a simple and modern-technology 

adaptable procurement process that will uniformly apply to all government 

procurement. Moreover, the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) issued 

Manual of Procedures for different modes of procurement to provide detailed 

guidelines to government agencies in the conduct of procurement activities.  

 

8.2 Table No. 15 shows the deficiencies/lapses observed in the review of awarded 
procurement contracts and purchase orders.

8.3 Non-compliance with pertinent provisions of RA No. 9184 and its RIRR has 
defeated the purpose of the law on transparency, competitiveness and 

accountability during the procurement process.  Moreover, non-compliance may 



62 

 

place the agency and its officers at possible risk of protest/complaint or charges that 

may be filed by the losing bidders. 

 

8.4 With regard to the non-compliance with RA No. 9184 on the procurement of 
security services in CY 2020 with contract cost of  P1,822,310.88, Management 

commented that the budget allocated for Security Services in 2020 Agency Budget 

Matrix only amounted to P488,000.00 which was only enough for  three (3) months. 

The OTS cannot enter into a one-year contract at that time due to budgetary 

constraint and only during second quarter and third quarter that modification was 

made to augment the allotment for the security services.  

 

8.5 We recommended and Management agreed to require the BAC and its 
Secretariat to strictly apply pertinent provisions of the RIRR of RA No. 9184 

and to properly and comprehensively document every step of the procurement 

process. 

 

 

Compliance with Other Rules and Regulations 

 

9. In monitoring OTS’ compliance with laws, rules and regulations, the Audit Team 
noted the following:  

 
Laws, Rules and Regulations  Audit Observations and Recommendations 

Compliance with RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020 on Gender and Development (GAD) 

Section 32 of the General Provisions 

of the GAA FY 2020, provides: “All 

agencies of the government shall 

formulate a GAD Plan designed to 

address gender issues within their 

concerned sectors or mandate and 

implement applicable provisions 

under RA No. 9710 or the Magna 

Carta of Women, Convention on the 

Elimination of all Forms of 

Discrimination Against Women, the 

Beijing Platform for Action, the 

Philippine Plan for Gender-

Responsive Development (1995-

2025), and the Philippine 

Development Plan (2017-2022).” 

 

 

Philippine Commission on Women 

(PCW) Memorandum Circular No. 

2020-03 requires that all national 

government agencies and 

instrumentalities are enjoined to 

review and revise, as necessary, their 

FY 2020 GAD Plan and Budget 

(GPB) to implement measures to 

An objective and effective assessment on the extent of 

Management’s accomplishments vis-à-vis its targets could 

not be done by the Audit Team due to the failure of the agency 

to: (a) prepare a revised FY 2020 GAD Plans and Budget as 

allowed under PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2020-0031;   

(b) report the cost on the implementation of  five (5) of the 17 

activities in its GAD Plan; and (c) quantify targets and 

performance indicators in  its 10 planned GAD activities. 

 

For CY 2020, the OTS had allocated P6,911,798.00 or 5.77 

percent of the agency’s total budget of P119,752,000.00 for 17 

GAD activities. As reported by Management, only five (5) of the 

17 GAD activities were implemented as follows: 

 

1. 18-day Campaign to End Violence Against Women; 
2. GAD-FPS Monthly Meetings; 
3. Reconstitution of GAD Focal Point System Members 

and conduct of three trainings in relation to GAD; 

4. Hiring of a consultant to improve the HGDG of OTS; 
and  

Issue policy pertaining to the deployment coverage, 

duty scheme and place of assignment of Security 

Screening Officers and other security staff. 

 
Management further explained that most of the GAD activities 

were not conducted due to the government-imposed community

Laws, Rules and Regulations  Audit Observations and Recommendations 

address gender issues and concerns 

arising from the unequal status of their 

women and men stakeholders due to 

the COVID-19 situation. Such 

measures should be in line with their 

respective agency mandates, Republic 

Act No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of 

Women and the Bayanihan to Heal As 

One Act. Xxx. 

 

quarantine to curb COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of revising the 

2020 GAD Annual Plan and Budget, the OTS extended the 

contract of 982 Job Orders assigned at the airport terminals 

nationwide.  The OTS provided all of its Security Screening 

Officers with protective equipment and risk allowances (Hazard 

Pay) and provision of transportation to all OTS front liners.  

 

The Audit Team is cognizant of the challenges posed by the 

COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, the formulation and 

implementation of GAD plans and activities is imposed upon by 

law to all government agencies which should be carried out with 

utmost importance just like any other mandated functions of the 

agency.  

 

It was also noted that out of the 17 activities, only seven have 

quantifiable performance indicators and target such as, definite 

number of participants, trainings conducted, workshop 

administered and number of personnel to be hired hence, we 

could not conduct objective and effective assessment of the 

extent of Management’s accomplishment vis a vis its targets.  

 
Furthermore, evaluation of Implementation of PY’s Audit 

Recommendation disclosed that Management has not 

developed/established a Sex Disaggregated Data (SDD) System 

to be used in policy making and program development in 

addressing gender issues in the agency contrary to PCW 

Memorandum Circular N0. 2014-05 due to absence of guidance 

and directive from DOTr on synchronized questionnaires and 

survey forms that will be used to collect data.    

 
We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a) comply with the PCW guidelines in implementing 
measures to address gender issues and concerns arising 

from the unequal status of women and men stakeholders 

due to the COVID-19 situation and revise GAD plan , if 

needed;    

b) consider other approaches and strategies to implement 
the GAD activities with all the challenges and threat to 

health and safety of the COVID-19 pandemic; 

 

c) direct the GAD focal person to provide the cost/budget, 
including the quantifiable, specific and attainable 

indicators for each GAD activity to warrant an objective 

and effective assessment of Management’s extent of 

implementation by the Audit Team; and 
 

d) ensure that a GAD sex-disaggregated data-system as 
required under PCW Memorandum Circular No. 2014-05 

is established so that planned activities relating thereto 

are fully implemented thereby the budgeted amount are 

fully utilized. 
 



64 

 

Laws, Rules and Regulations  Audit Observations and Recommendations 

Compliance with RA No. 11465 or the GAA for FY 2020-Programs and Projects Related to Senior 

Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs) 

Section 32 of the General Provisions 

of GAA for FY 2020 requires all 

agencies of the government to 

formulate plans, programs and 

projects intended to address the 

concerns of SCs and PWDs, insofar as 

it relates to their mandated functions, 

and integrate the same in their regular 

activities, and directs that government 

infrastructure and facilities provides 

architectural or structural features, 

designs or facilities that will 

reasonably enhance the mobility, 

safety and welfare of persons with 

disability pursuant to BP Blg. 344 and 

RA No. 7277, as amended. 

 

Of the eight (8) programs/activities/projects formulated by 

the Office for Transportation Security to address the 

concerns of senior citizens and persons with disability, three 

(3) activities were not implemented due to the health risks 

posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.   
 

The OTS is a member of the Task Force on Accessibility with the 

function to prepare plans, programs and funding requirements for 

the implementation of B.P. 344 and RA No. 7277 in the 

transportation sector  which was created pursuant to Department 

of Transportation (DOTr) Special Order No. 2015-460 dated 

October 28, 2015. It allotted P930,967.50 or 0.78 percent of the 

agency’s total budget of P119,752,000.00 for eight (8) major SCs 

and PWDs. 

  

Out of the eight (8) programs and activities, only five (5) were 

implemented utilizing P603,738.36 or 64.85 percent of the 

allotted funds thereof, as follows: 

 

1. installation of signage painting of accessible parking 
area and ramp, and maintenance of PWD railings; 

2. conducted the trainings in relation to the concerns of 
SCs and PWDs; 

3. attendance and participation into other related activities 
such as celebration of “Women with Disability Month” 

conducted by the National Council for Disability 

Affairs; 

4. procurement of Medicines for Senior Citizen amidst 
COVID-19; and   

5. Monetary Assistance to Senior Citizen due to economic 
and financial effects brought about by COVID-19 

 

The OTS opted to conduct virtual trainings in relation to the 

concerns of SCs and PWDs in view of the challenges in mobility 

and threat to health and safety brought about by the COVID-19 

pandemic, thus reducing the cost incurred in implementing the 

plans and programs for SCs and PWDs. 

 

Three (3) of the eight (8) major programs to address the concerns 

of SCs and PWDs were not pushed through due to the 

government-imposed community quarantine to curb COVID-19 

pandemic, to wit:  

 

1. attendance in conduct of accessibility audit/inspection 
with DOTr Task Force on Accessibility (TFOA) in air, 

water, land and rail sectors; 

2. conduct of laboratory examination for SCs; and 
3. seminar and consultation on cardio-vascular disease and 

diabetes mellitus. 

 



65 

 

Laws, Rules and Regulations  Audit Observations and Recommendations 

Management commented that the non-implementation of said 

activities was “due to the challenges in mobility and threat to 

health and safety brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic”. 

 

Management explained that the conduct of accessibility 

audit/inspection to air, water, land and rail sectors is a project 

of and spearheaded by  the DOTr Task Force on Accessibility 

(TFOA), which cancelled the activity in view of the challenges 

posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.   

 

The Audit Team is cognizant of the challenges posed by the 

COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, the formulation and 

implementation of activities to address the concerns of SCs and 

PWDs is required by law to all agencies which should be carried 

out with utmost importance just like any other mandated 

functions of the agency. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed that the OTS 

focal persons on SC and PWD consider other approaches and 

strategies to implement the programs, projects and activities 

that are responsive to the needs of SCs and PWDs amidst the 

challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.   

 

Compliance with RA No. 10963 or The Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN Act) and 

its Implementing Rules and Regulations 

Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 11-

2018 dated January 31, 2018 

constituted all employers of 

government/private offices as 

withholding agents for purposes of the 

creditable tax required to be withheld 

on income payments from 

compensation, contractors, suppliers 

of goods and other services. As 

withholding agents, they are primarily 

liable for the payment of the taxes to 

the National Treasury thru the Bureau 

of Internal Revenue (BIR). 

 

Section 4-114-2 of RR No. 13-2018 

dated March 15, 2018 provides that
