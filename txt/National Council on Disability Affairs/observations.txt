PART II – OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
Financial Audit 
 
Accounting Errors 
 
1. Various accounts of the National Council on Disability Affairs (NCDA) under 
the Assets, Liabilities, and Equity were misstated by P319,809.60, P33,163.12, and 
P248,386.48, which represents 0.90 percent, 1.61 percent, and 0.74 percent of its total 
Assets, Liabilities, and Equity, respectively, due to various accounting 
errors/deficiencies amounting to P14,680,994.85 or 41.25 percent of its total assets. 
The misstatements and deficiencies had significant impact on the balances of the 
affected accounts; thus, the accuracy of the balances, completeness and existence of 
the said accounts could not be relied upon. 

 
2. Paragraph 27 of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) 1 
and Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for National 
Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, provides that: “the financial statements shall 
present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. 
Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other 
events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for 
assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in IPSAS. The application of IPSAS, with 
additional disclosures when necessary, is presented to result in financial statements that 
achieved a fair presentation.” 

 
3. Moreover, Section 111 and 112 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 requires the 
agencies to keep the accounts in such detail as necessary to meet the needs of the agency 
and at the same time be adequate to furnish the information needed by fiscal or control 
agencies of the government; and that the highest standard of honesty, objectivity and 
consistency shall be observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or 
misleading information.  Each government agency shall record its financial transactions 
and operations conformably with IPSAS and in accordance with pertinent laws and 
regulations. 
 
4. Volume III of the GAM for NGAs provides the Revised Chart of Accounts (RCA) 
to be used by NGAs in recording transactions.   

 

5. Verification of the Disbursement Vouchers (DVs), Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs), 
General Ledgers (GLs), Subsidiary Ledgers (SLs), Purchase Orders (POs), and Inventory 
and Property records, disclosed accounting errors/omissions; thereby, affecting the 
accuracy and reliability of the account balances as shown in the following Table 1:

Erroneous recording of Transactions  
 
a. Unreplenished Petty Cash Fund Expenses 

 

6. Section 54, Chapter 19 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) , Volume I 
requires the Petty Cash Fund (PCF) adjustment, to wit: 
 
7. “At the end of the year, all unreplenished Petty Cash Fund expenses shall be 
reported and supporting papers submitted to the Accounting Division/Unit, to recognize 
the expenses incurred to the period to which they relate. In case no replenishment could 
be made for lack of fund, a JEV shall be prepared to recognize all the expenses paid under 
the Petty Cash with a credit to the account “Petty Cash”. If replenishment is made, the 
credit shall be the appropriate cash account.” (Underscore ours) 
 
8. Review of the General Ledger of the Accounts Payable account revealed that it 
included unreplenished PCF expenses totaling P33,163.12 as per JEV Nos. 2020-12-GJ123 
and 2020-12-GJ125 both dated December 31, 2020, with breakdown as follows:

JEV No. 2020-12-GJ123 13,567.06 

Total 33,163.12 

 
9. These expenses have been paid out of the PCF, however, it was recorded as a credit 
to the Accounts Payable account contrary to the provisions of Section 54, Chapter 19 of 
the GAM for NGAs, Volume I which resulted to the overstatement of accounts Petty Cash 
and Account Payable. 
  
10. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: (i) 
draw a JEV to correct the entry made to record the unreplenished PCF expenses by 
debiting the Accounts Payable account and crediting the Petty Cash account; and (ii) 
strictly comply with Section 54, Chapter 19 of the GAM, Volume I. 
 
11. Management commented that since these expenses have already been paid and the 
Accounts Payable has been cancelled in January 2021, there is no need to draw a separate 
Journal Entry Voucher to correct the entry as the previous entries have been counter-
balanced. 
 
b. Error in the recording of undelivered items 
 
12. Non-compliance with the procedures in the Receipt, Inspection, Acceptance 
and Recording of Deliveries of Inventory Items, contrary to Chapter 8 of the GAM, 
Volume I, which resulted in recording of undelivered items. 
 
13. Section 17(j), Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I requires the Inspection and 
Acceptance Report (IAR) to be prepared and maintained by the Supply Custodian, which 
shall be used for inspection and acceptance of purchased and delivered property, supplies 
and materials. 

 
14. Likewise, Section 15 of the same GAM Chapter provides the procedures in the 
Receipt, Inspection, Acceptance and Recording of Deliveries of Inventory Items, among 
others, as follows: 
 

Table 3. Accounting procedures of Inventory items 
 

Area of Responsibility Seq. No. Activity 

Supply Custodian 1 Signs “Received” portion of the original and Copy 2 of the Delivery 
Receipt (DR). Files the original and returns Copy 2 of the DR to 
the Supplier/Procurement Service. 

2 Prepares Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR) (Appendix 62) 
in four (4) copies. Forwards Copies 1-4 of IAR, original of DR, and 
Copy 2 of approved PO to the Property Inspector for inspection of 
deliveires. 

Inspection Committee 
Property Inspector 

3 Inspects and verifies items as to quantity and conformity to 
specifications based on the DR and approved PO. If delivery is not 
in conformity to the specifications or delivery is incomplete, 



28 
 

Area of Responsibility Seq. No. Activity 

indicates notation on the IAR that the deliveries are not in 
conformity to specifications and/or terms agreed under the 
approved PO and returns the Copies 1-4 of IAR, original of DR, 
and Copy 2 of approved PO to the Property and/or Supply 
Division/Unit. If delivery is in order, indicates the date of inspection, 
places “√” in the box for “Inspected, verified and found in order as 
to quantity and specifications”, and signs the “Inspection” portion 
of the IAR. Retains Copy 2 of IAR and forwards Copies 1,3 and 4 
of IAR, original of DR and Copy 2 of PO to the Property and/or 
Supply Custodain for acceptance of goods delivered. 

Supply Custodian 4 For deliveries not conforming to specification and/or terms of the 
PO, receives Copies 1-4 of IAR, original of DR and Copy 2 of PO. 
Returns the items to the supplier and requires the latter to comply 
with the agreed specifications and/or terms of the PO. Xxx 
(Emphasis ours) 

 
15. Review of the Office Supplies Inventory account disclosed discrepancies in the 
quantity of the delivered items as against the IAR totaling P19,130.00, details as follows:

Total 19,130.00 

 
16. Audit revealed that the incomplete items delivered were accepted by the Supply 
Custodian without any notation on the discrepancy in the quantity delivered to serve as 
basis for payment, thus, payments were made including the undelivered items which is not 
in accordance with Section 15, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I.  The delivered items 
should have been returned by the Supply/Property Unit to the supplier in compliance with 
the terms of the PO, as provided in sequence no. 4 of Table 3. 
 
17. Lapses in the acceptance of the delivered items posed risk on the reliability and 
effectiveness of the internal controls. 

 
18. We recommended and Management agreed to strengthen its internal controls 
to mitigate risks on the Receipt, Inspection, Acceptance and Recording of Deliveries 
of Inventory Items. 

 
19. We likewise recommended and Management agreed to require: 

 



29 
 

a. The Supply Custodian to: (i) require the supplier to deliver the undelivered 
items and submit to COA the IAR on the deliveries to be made; and (ii) 
submit justification on why the deliveries were accepted despite non-
conformance with the PO; (iii) return to the Supplier the items delivered 
with report on the discrepancy noted which should have been in 
compliance with the terms and conditions stated in the PO; and (iv) 
scrutinize well the items delivered before accepting them and ensure that 
the delivered items are in accordance with the specifications, quantities, 
etc. stated in the PO. 

 
b. The Accountant to draw a JEV to adjust the payment made with the 

supplier reflecting receivables for the undelivered inventory items; and 
 
c. The Accounting and Supply Units to conduct regular reconciliation of their 

records/reports to ensure that all deliveries and issuances are fully 
accounted for. 

 
20. Management commented that the items were actually delivered completely; 
however, there was an error in the Inspection and Acceptance Report wherein not all 
quantity received were recorded.  The Inspection and Acceptance Report was under-
reported. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 
21. No additional IAR was submitted to COA to support their claim of complete 
delivery. 

 
c. Capitalization of tangible items below the threshold of P15,000.00 

 
22. Section 3, Chapter 10 of the GAM, Volume I provides the criteria for recognizing 
an item of PPE as Assets, as follows: 

 
a. if it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential 

associated with the item will flow to the entity; 
b. if the cost or fair value of the item can be measured reliably; 
c. if it is beneficial ownership and control clearly rest with the government; 
d. if the asset is used to achieve government objectives; and 
e. if it meets the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00. 

 
23. Section 4 of the same Chapter states that, the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 
represents the minimum cost of an individual asset recognized as a PPE on the Statement 
of Financial Position. This threshold shall be applied on an individual asset or per item 
basis. Each item within the bulk acquisition with aggregate or total value of PPE, such as 
library books, computer peripherals and small items of equipment, will need to meet the 
capitalization threshold to be recognized as PPE. (Underscore ours) 
 



30 
 

24. Likewise, Section 10, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I requires tangible items 
below the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 to be accounted as semi-expendable 
property. The following policies apply as follows: 
 

a. Semi-expendable property which were recognized as PPE shall be 
reclassified to the affected accounts. 

b. These tangible items shall be recognized as expenses upon issue to the end-
user. 
 

25. Review of the General Ledger revealed that the disbursements made to purchase 
window blinds totaling P260,780.74 for the Disability Resource and Development Center 
(DRDC) Building was capitalized and debited to the Furniture and Fixtures account. 
Details as follows:

Total 260,780.74 12,394.26  248,386.48  

 

26. Computation of the cost per item of these window blinds appeared that it did not 
meet the capitalization threshold of P15,000.00 as prescribed in Sections 3 and 4, Chapter 
10 of the GAM, Volume I. These should have been recognized as semi-expendable 
properties in accordance with Section 10, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I. As a result, 
Furniture and Fixtures account was overstated by P248,386.48. 

 
27. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: (i) 
draw a JEV to reclassify the window blinds to Semi-expendable properties in 
accordance with Section 10, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I; and (ii) strictly comply 
with the capitalization threshold as prescribed in Sections 3 and 4, Chapter 10 of the 
GAM, Volume I in the recognition of PPE assets. 
 
Accounting Deficiencies 

 
28. Various accounting deficiencies totaling P14,680,994.85 were also noted in 
recording the transactions of Receivables, Office Supplies Inventory and Property, Plant 
and Equipment accounts that have impact on the fairness of presentation of the balances of 
the accounts in the FSs as discussed in Table 6.

Non-compliance with the perpetual inventory system 
 
31. Non-preparation of the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) on the 
inventories issued for the period, under the perpetual inventory system, is contrary to 
Section 17, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I that resulted in the unavailability of the 
real time information on the actual balance of the Office Supplies Inventory account.  
 
32. Section 9, Chapter 8 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM), Volume I, 
provides the guidelines for the Perpetual Inventory Method, to wit: 

 
“Supplies and materials purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using 
the perpetual inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records xxx. 
Regular purchases shall be coursed through the inventory account and issues 
thereof shall be recorded as they take place except for supplies and materials 
purchases out of PCF for immediate use or an emergency cases which shall be 
charged directly to the appropriate expense account.” (Emphasis ours) 

 
33. Audit of the GL and the RPCI on the Office Supplies Inventory account with 
balances of P646,733.92 and P778,609.18, respectively, showed a variance of P131,875.26. 
To establish the reliability of the quantities and amounts recorded in the RPCI, we 
conducted a physical count of the inventories on February 16, 2021 and discrepancies were 
noted in the quantities of supplies as reported in the RPCI and as per audit. 
 
34. Analysis of accounts Office Supplies Inventory and Office Supplies Expense 
revealed that issuances of supplies for the months of January to December 2020, totaling 
P509,759.58, were recorded in the books only on December 31, 2020.   The Accountant 
disclosed that this is due to the late submission of the RSMI by the Supply Custodian as a 
basis for the preparation of the JEV; thus, not in keeping with the principles of the perpetual 
inventory method in which inventories should have been recorded as its issuances took 
place to ensure the availability of the real time information on the actual balance of the 
Office Supplies Inventory.  

 
35. Inquiry disclosed that the Supply Custodian belatedly submitted the RSMIs due to 
voluminous work at hand, resulting in the non-recording of the supplies issued for the 
period and the unavailability of the real time information on the actual balance of the Office 
Supplies Inventory account. The Supply Unit is manned by only one staff who also serves 
as BAC Secretariat and is also in charge of the technical issues of the Office Equipment 
whenever a malfunction arises. It is worthy to note that the Supply Officer position has 
been vacant since February 2019.  



37 
 

 
36. We recommended and Management agreed to require: 
 

a. The Supply Custodian to regularly prepare and submit the RSMI in 
compliance with Section 17, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I; 

 
b. The Accountant to strictly observe the Perpetual Inventory Method in 

recording purchases and issuances as they take place; and 
 
c. The HR Officer to fast-track the hiring of a Supply Officer for a more 

effective execution of their duties and responsibilities. 
 

37. Management commented that the Supply Section is undermanned, therefore, there 
were the usual delays in the submission of reports.  The Personnel Section, however, has 
started with its publication of vacancies hoping to fill up the Supply Officer position 
vacated in 2019. 
 
38. For the year 2020, all issuances of supplies for the year have been reported and 
recorded in the books within the year unlike in the past. 
 
Lapses in the procurement process 
 
39. The procurement of the Inventory and Disposal System by the NCDA in CY 
2019 for P449,000.00 was non-compliant with the provisions of the Revised 
Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of RA 9184 due to lapses in the 
procurement process. 
 
40. Item V.D.8.b, Annex H of the RIRR of RA 9184 provides the procurement 
procedures through Small Value Procurement (SVP), to wit: 

 
i. The End-User shall submit a request for SVP to the BAC, which indicates the 

technical specifications, scope of work, terms of reference, ABC and other terms 
and conditions. 

 
ii. The BAC shall prepare and send the RFQs/RFPs to at least three (3) suppliers, 

contractors or consultants of known qualifications. This, notwithstanding, those 
who responded through any of the required postings shall be allowed to 
participate. Receipt of at least one (1) quotation is sufficient to proceed with the 
evaluation thereof. 

 
iii. Except for those with ABCs equal to Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) and 

below, RFQs shall be posted for a period of three (3) calendar days in the 
PhilGEPS website, website of the Procuring Entity, if available, and at any 
conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the premises of the Procuring 
Entity. 

 



38 
 

iv. Pre-bid conference may be conducted at the discretion of the BAC, in order to 
clarify and/or explain any of the requirements, terms, conditions, and 
specifications stipulated in the RFQ/RFP. 

 
v. After the deadline for submission of quotations/proposals, an Abstract of 

Quotations/Ratings shall be prepared setting forth the names of those who 
responded to the RFQ/RFP, their corresponding price quotations/ratings. 

 
vi. The BAC shall recommend to the HOPE the award of contract in favor of the 

supplier or contractor with the Single or Lowest Calculated and Responsive 
Quotation (for goods or infrastructure projects), or consultant with the Single 
or Highest Rated and Responsive Proposal (for consulting services). In case of 
approval, the HOPE shall immediately enter into contract with the said 
supplier, contractor or consultant. (Underscore ours) 

 
41. On December 4, 2019, the NCDA entered into a contract with Afield Consulting 
Inc., the supplier for the procurement of the Inventory and Disposal System for 
P449,000.00. 
 
42. The Inventory and Disposal System which is a web-based system that can be 
accessed through browser, was part of the Information Systems Strategic Plan 2018-2020 
(ISSP) approved by the Department of Information and Communications Technology 
(DICT) on May 27, 2019. It was described as a stand-alone system that will manage the 
ordering, storing, deployment and disposing of the agency’s supply, materials, equipment, 
fixed assets and other items. 
 
43. On December 13, 2019, the NCDA issued the Notice to Proceed to the supplier and 
the system was inspected and accepted by the Agency on December 17, 2019 as shown in  
the Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR).  

 
44. Audit of the disbursement voucher (DV) and its supporting documents, such as the 
Purchase Order (PO), Purchase Request, product brochure, Request for 
Quotations/Proposals, Abstract of Quotations, posting made to PhilGEPS, Notice of 
Award, Notice to Proceed and other documents relative to the procurement, revealed the 
end-user’s non-submission of the other essential documents for the procurement activity 
like the technical specifications, scope of work and terms of reference that resulted in the 
non-determination of the date of delivery, delivery terms and the payment terms. The only 
description included in the PO were the following: 

 
a. Software License PLUS Master Data Management and Security (Role based 

access control and Audit Trail) 
b. Inventory and Disposal Management System 
c. Data Migration Support 
d. User and Admin Training 
e. System Documentation 
f. Twelve (12) Months: Fixing of Bugs and Issues Minor Changes 5 hr. service 

per month upgrade of browser, software updates, remote back up restoration 



39 
 

 
45. Based on the above-cited description, the procurement of the computer system did 
not have technical specifications, thus, inspection and acceptance of the system had no 
criteria to be compared with. 

 
46. Verification of the output of the system revealed that it was non-compliant with 
what was prescribed in the GAM.  For example, the method used in costing the inventories 
is the specific identification method instead of the weighted average method as prescribed 
in Sections 5 and 6, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I resulting in misstatement of the 
account balances.  The method used in the system was to create a new item if the unit cost 
differs from their previously acquired inventory even though the items are identical in 
nature.  
 
47. Inquiry with Management revealed that the requesting party merely submitted the 
Purchase Request without indicating the technical specifications of the system needed. A 
member of the BAC, however, informed us that since the contract price was small, they did 
not require the technical specifications.  The Accountant also informed us that the supplier 
of the System also made the same system in other agencies, hence, they relied only on the 
product brochure.  Since the PO did not indicate the technical specifications of the system, 
the Agency cannot hold the supplier accountable for the non-conformity of the system with 
the prescribed costing method. Thus, amending/updating/reprogramming the system will 
require additional cost to the Agency which will result in wastage of government funds. 
 
48. Management’s non-adherence to the provisions in the RIRR, entering into a contract 
without indicating the technical specifications is a manifestation of a control weakness of 
the agency’s procurement system. 

 
49. We recommended and Management agreed to require the BAC to: (i) submit 
a justification why the contract was entered into without indicating technical 
specifications; and (ii)  strictly observe procurement laws, rules and regulations 
provided in RA 9184 and RIRR of 2016 and the Government Procurement Manual 
issued by the GPPB for the proper conduct of Government Procurement. 
 
50. Management commented that there was a technical specification in the proposed 
brochure submitted by the supplier specific to the requirements of the NCDA. 
 
51. It was a small value procurement where all the BAC members signed the Abstract 
of Quotations approving the award of the contract.  There was no separate BAC resolution 
made for the award of the contract like in public bidding. 
 
52. Hence, the BAC committed to submit a separate explanation within the month. 
 
Non-inclusion in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP) 

53. The procurement of the Inventory and Disposal System was not included in the 
agency’s annual procurement plan (APP) for CY 2019, contrary to the provisions 



40 
 

under Section 7, Rule II of RA 9184, and showed weaknesses in the agency’s efficient 
and effective procurement system. 
  
54. Item 7.2, Section 7, Rule II of RA 9184 provides that, no procurement shall be 
undertaken unless it is in accordance with the approved APP, including approved changes 
thereto. The APP must be consistent with the duly approved yearly budget of the Procuring 
Entity and shall bear the approval of the HoPE or second-ranking official designated by 
the HopE to act on his behalf. (Underscore ours) 
 
55. Likewise, item 7.4 of the same Section states that, changes to the individual PPMPs 
and the consolidated APP may be undertaken every six (6) months or as often as may be 
required by the HoPE. The respective end-user or implementing units of the Procuring 
Entity shall be responsible for the changes to the PPMPs, while the BAC Secretariat shall 
be responsible for the consolidation of these PPMPs into an APP, which shall be subject to 
the approval of the HoPE. Changes in the APP, if any, for the budget year shall be submitted 
to the GPPB in July of the current budget year, and in January of the following budget year. 
 
56. Item 9.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 requires, among others, 
the documentary requirements for procurement through Alternative Mode-SVP, as follows: 
 

BAC Resolution recommending and justifying to the Head of Procuring Entity (HOPE) 
the use of alternative mode of procurement and approval by the HOPE of the BAC 
Resolution recommending award of contract.  (Underscore ours) 

 
57. Review of the APP of the NCDA revealed that the procurement of the Inventory 
and Disposal System was not included in the agency’s procurement plan for CY 2019, 
contrary to Section 7, Rule II of RA 9184.   
 
58. This procurement was part of the ISSP and the budget was already earmarked for 
this, however, upon the approval of the ISSP on May 27, 2019, no supplemental APP was 
prepared/done. 
 
59. Interview with the BAC Secretariat revealed that the staff in charge of preparing the 
supplemental APP was on maternity leave, resulting in the non-preparation and non-
submission of the same. 

 
60. Further, the BAC Resolution recommending the award of the contract was not 
submitted to the Audit Team, contrary to Item 9.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated 
June 14, 2012. 
 
61. We recommended and Management agreed to require the BAC to: (i) ensure 
that all goods and services to be procured shall be included in the APP and that the 
APP should be implemented as approved; (ii) submit the BAC Resolution 
recommending the award of contract; and (iii) strictly comply with the provisions of 
RA 9184 and COA Circular No. 2012-001. 

 



41 
 

62. Management commented that there was a separate Information System Strategic 
Plan (ISSP) for the purchase of this Inventory System, which was not integrated in the 
overall APP. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 
63. Although the budget has already been earmarked for the IISP, the purchase of the 
Inventory System should still be part of the approved APP in conformity with Item 7.2, 
Section 7, Rule II of RA 9184 that no procurement shall be undertaken unless it is in 
accordance with the approved APP. 
 
Non-issuance of procured ICT Equipment to end-user 
 
64. Fourteen (14) sets of desktop computers totaling P593,465.60 delivered on 
August 26, 2020, as part of NCDA’s Information System Strategic Plan (ISSP) 
Program remained in the stockroom and not yet issued to the end-users, thus, casting 
doubt on the necessity of the procured Information and Communications Technology 
(ICT) equipment, for the efficient discharge of the agency’s day-to-day operations. 
 
65. Section 7.1 of the Revised IRR of RA 9184 provides that, all procurement shall be 
within the approved budget of the Procuring Entity and should be meticulously and 
judiciously planned by the Procuring Entity. Consistent with government fiscal discipline 
measures, only those considered crucial to the efficient discharge of governmental 
functions shall be included in the Annual Procurement Plan (APP). For purposes of this 
IRR, a procurement project shall be considered crucial to the efficient discharge of 
governmental functions if it is required for the day-to-day operations or is in pursuit of the 
principal mandate of the Procuring Entity concerned. The APP shall include provisions 
for foreseeable emergencies based on historical records. In the case of Infrastructure 
Projects, the APP shall consider the appropriate timing/phasing of related project 
activities, such as, engineering design and acquisition of right-of-way site or location, to 
reduce/lower project costs. (Underscore ours) 
 
66. Physical count revealed that 14 sets of desktop computers totaling P593,465.60 
delivered on August 26, 2020, as part of NCDA’s ISSP Program, remained in the 
stockroom and not yet issued to the end-users. The non-issuance of the procured equipment 
cast doubt on the necessity of procured ICT equipment in the efficient discharge of the 
agency’s day-to-day operations. 
 
67. Moreover, for CY 2021 there are proposals to procure additional ICT equipment 
specifically desktop computers and laptops with Operating System (OS) and Microsoft 
Office for the implementation of ISSP 2021 amounting to P1,152,000.00 as included in 
their APP, which may not be necessary as evidenced by the non-issuance of the same ICT 
equipment procured in CY 2020.  
 
68. The procurement of additional ICT equipment for CY 2021 that may not be issued 
to the end-users immediately is not advisable since these items become obsolete/degraded/ 



42 
 

outdated every day because their functionality change over time with the invention of 
upgraded products that make technology changes quickly. 
 
69. We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 
a. issue the existing ICT equipment to the end-users to maximize its use 

according to its purpose; and 
 

b. revisit the APP on the need to procure additional ICT equipment in the 
future to prevent unnecessary spending of government funds. 

 
70. Management commented that there is a pending project of the Disability Resource 
and Development Center where the desktops are intended. The said equipment shall be 
issued once the project becomes operational. 

 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 
71. Since the project is not yet operational, the purchase of ICT Equipment at this time 
may not be cost-efficient/effective as technology is constantly advancing. Meanwhile, the 
already procured equipment may be issued to/utilized by other offices that have requested 
for similar ICT equipment. 
 
Delayed submission of Contract of Agreement with Incomplete Documentary 
Requirements 
 
72.        Non-/delayed submission of supporting documents in the contract of 
agreement with a security services corporation and in the liquidation/replenishment 
of cash advances (CAs) or Petty Cash Fund (PCF) granted to accountable officers 
(AOs) affected the timely review and evaluation thereof by the Audit Team and cast 
doubts on the reliability and validity of the transactions.

84. Item 3.3.1 of COA Circular No. 2004-006 dated September 9, 2004 provides 
guidelines on the paper-based evidence of receipt of payment in the form of 
Reimbursement Expense Receipt (RER). “The RER shall be acceptable for disbursements 
where the payee is not a business entity required by the Bureau of Internal Revenue to issue 
Official Receipts (ORs) and the money is advanced by the official concerned and the 
expense is authorized to be reimbursed by the government agency concerned.” 
 
85. Section 36, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides the documentary 
requirements for the PCF and under the liquidation of PCF, it states “Canvass from at least 
three suppliers for purchases involving P1,000 and above, except for purchases made while 
on official travel." 
 
83 Item 1.2.2 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012 – Revised 
Guidelines and Documentary Requirements for Common Government Transactions, 
“requires an approved purchase request with certificate of Emergency Purchase, if 
necessary.” 
 
84. With regard to the liquidation/replenishment of PCF/CAs granted to AOs, the 
provision on the RER was superseded by the issuance of COA Circular No. 2017-001 dated 
June 19, 2017, which provides that expenses amounting to P300.00 or less incurred by 
government officials and employees in the discharge of their official functions need not be 
supported by official receipts; however, the official/employee concerned shall be required 
to submit a certification as supporting document, except for the following: 

 
a. Payment of fares in public utility vehicles issuing receipts such as bus, train, 

vessel/ship; and 
 
b. Purchases in business establishments issuing receipts.

85. In our examination of the supporting documents of the liquidations and/or 
replenishments, we have noted that disbursements totaling P98,331.91 were liquidated 
without complete supporting documents. Details as follows:

86. Audit of the replenishments/liquidations revealed that expenses totaling P26,419.93 
were supported only with either a photocopy of the ORs or a piece of paper showing 
payments made, or with no proof at all. PCF used for payment of bank charges was 
disbursed and replenished without any proof of payment. The said amount also included 
stipend for the priest amounting to P2,000.00 each, i.e., for the conduct of NCDA 
Teambuilding and for Honoring the retirees, from the AO’s cash advances, which were 
supported with Certification of Expenses not requiring receipts (CENR), contrary to COA 
Circular No. 2017-001, which only requires CENR for expenses amounting to P300.00 or 
less. 
 
87. Moreover, disbursements incurred amounting to P300.00 and below, without ORs, 
such as payment of transportation expenses when riding jeepneys and tricycles, and 
payment to postal office which were supported only with a piece of paper showing the 
summary of the disbursements, is not compliant with COA Circular No. 2017-001 dated 
June 19, 2017, which requires CENR as supporting document.  
 
88. The bulk of transactions without complete documentary requirements amounting 
to P51,905.08 pertained to disbursement for meals during meetings of the staff involving 
P1,000.00 and above; however, no Inspection and Acceptance Reports (IAR) and/or 
canvasses were made and subsequently, no Summary/Abstract of Canvass were prepared 
for these particular transactions, contrary to COA Circular No. 2012-001.  
 
89. Furthermore, disbursements totaling P1,560.00 pertained to payment of 
transportation expenses of the board members and the personal assistant of one of the board 
members who is a Person with Disability (PWD). The transportation expenses were only 
supported with GRAB receipts and CENR. However, there was no Office Order issued to 
support the travelling expenses as required under Item 1.2.4 of COA Circular No. 2012-
001 for local travel. 
 



49 
 

90. Non-compliance with the prescribed documentary requirements is an internal 
control deficiency, thus, validity of the disbursements cannot be assured. Likewise, 
government funds are not safeguarded against possible loss/misappropriation. 
 
91. In addition, upon examination of the Petty Cash Fund Record of the Special 
Disbursing Officer (SDO), it showed that some purchases amounting to P1,000.00 and 
more were not supported by canvass from at least three suppliers. For some purchases in 
Table 12, the SDO just attached his certification in a feedback report that the particular 
item was purchased:

92. On the other hand, there were also expenses that cost P1,000.00 and above that 
were paid out of PCF for the repair and maintenance of the service vehicle of NCDA. The 
disbursements were made without securing canvass or quotations from at least three (3) 
suppliers or authority and justification from the Head of Administrative Service. Interview 
with the SDO revealed that he was instructed by the Executive Director to have the repair 
and maintenance of their vehicles done in a service center wherein they cater/serve that 
particular brand of vehicle. In addition, registration and other expenses relative to the 
service vehicle were also charged to the PCF. Details for car Repair and Maintenance

93. Moreover, there were also expenses for labor that were charged against the PCF 
that cost P1,000,00 and above, wherein no certification from the Head of Agency or 
authorized representative that the item for disbursement was necessary for petty operating 
expenses of the agency as shown in Table 14, which is not a good internal control.

94. We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 
a. require the concerned officials to submit the lacking documents as 

identified above as well as the submission of the Contract of Agreement as 
prescribed in the above-cited provisions; otherwise, we shall be constrained 
to suspend in audit the transactions pertaining thereto;  

 
b. strictly comply with COA Circular No. 2017-001 on the proper usage of 

CENR which is only for expenses amounting to P300.00 or less and issue 
RER for expenses worth more than P300.00 in compliance with Item 3.3.1 
of COA Circular No. 2004-006 dated September 9, 2004;  

 
c. ensure that purchases involving P1,000.00 and above be supported by 

canvasses from at least three (3) suppliers and strictly comply with Section 
36, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; 

 
d. secure certification/justification from the Head of Agency or his 

authorized representative that purchases involving P1,000.00 and above 
are emergency in nature; and 

 
e. use the PCF only for petty operating expenses. 

 



51 
 

95. Management commented that the BAC Secretariat shall ensure that an advance 
copy of the contract, together with other bidding documentation, shall be furnished to the 
Auditor as required.   
 
96. Likewise, Management committed to submit the original copy of the ORs for some 
expenses totaling P26,419.93 that was left in the custody of the Accounting Unit since the 
copies for the Accounting Unit and the COA were unintentionally mixed-up. Management 
further commented that some items like notarization of documents are also unreceipted 
since the notary public is not issuing ORs. In some instances, the bank charges on deposits 
made are machine-validated only in the deposit slip itself without an OR. 
 
97. The Supply Section is now providing Abstract of Quotations and Inspection 
Reports to the Petty Cash Fund expenses amounting to P1,000.00 and above. 
 
98. The RER and Certification shall be used for the purposes intended, as 
recommended. 
 
99. As to the observation on purchases like meals made out of the PCF that must have 
canvasses and abstract of canvass, the purchases are usually immediate in nature and no 
actual canvass was made, however, we will comply with the requirement for our 
succeeding transactions. 
 
100. As to the absence of IAR for the items bought under PCF because in some instances, 
the member of the Inspection Committee just affixes his/her signature on the OR as an 
evidence of inspection. However, prospectively, we will practice the submission of a 
separate IAR for this purpose. 
 
101. With regard to the non-submission of the Office Order for the official travel of the 
Board Member, the Administration Office usually prepares an Office Order or Travel 
Order for employees and job order workers of the Council only. Those who do not belong 
to its plantilla or contracted personnel are not issued Office Order. 
 
Auditor’s Rejoinder: 
 
102. It is emphasized that disbursements, as provided under COA Circular No. 2017-
001 dated June 19, 2017, be attached with the CENR to support expenses amounting only 
to P300.00 or less, and RER for expenses more than P300.00 as provided under COA 
Circular No. 2004-006 dated September 9, 2004. 
 
103. We reiterated our recommendation that an Office Order be secured to support travel 
expenses of the board members.  Since an Office Order is issued only to officials and 
employees employed under the Council, we recommend that the Office Order be secured 
from the employer of the board member to substantiate or support the travelling expenses 
incurred as required under Item 1.2.4 of COA Circular No. 2012-001 dated June 14, 2012. 
 



52 
 

104. We interpose no objection to the repair of NCDA service vehicles done in a service 
center of a particular brand of vehicle, like the repair of a Toyota Commuter, which was 
directly negotiated with the Toyota service center, provided that there should be a 
certification/justification from the Head of Agency or his authorized representative that a 
negotiated procurement will be undertaken for the repair of a particular vehicle. 
 
105. Management commented that most often than not, the items purchased out of the 
PCF are immediate or urgent in nature. However, for other items falling under repairs, they 
will comply with the requirement of obtaining three quotations from different suppliers, if 
the cost involves P1,000 and above. 
 
Other Compliance Audit 
 
Gender and Development (GAD) 
 
106. The NCDA has not fully achieved some of the Gender and Development (GAD) 
initiatives due to non-allocation of at least five percent of the Agency’s budget in the 
implementation of GAD activities. 
 
107. Section 31 of RA 11465, also known as the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for 
FY 2020, states that: 

 
“Section 31. Programs and Projects Related to Gender and Development. All 
agencies of the government shall formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) 
Plan designed to address gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate 
and implement the applicable provisions under R.A. No. 9710 or the Magna Carta 
of Women, Convention as the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against 
Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for Gender-
Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippines Development Plan 
(2017-2022).  
 
The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, which 
shall be at least five percent (5%) of their budgets, for this purpose, activities 
currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those that 
contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially of 
marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of women’s human 
rights, and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered sufficient 
compliance with said requirement. Utilization of the GAD budget shall be 
evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified by said agencies.” 
 
The preparations and submission of the annual GAD Plan and annual GAD 
Accomplishment Report shall be subject to the guidelines issued by the agencies 
concerned.” 
 

108. Likewise, Sections 4.2 and 4.5 of the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) 
Memorandum Circular No. 2011-01 requires, to wit: 



53 
 

 
Section 4.2 Agencies with existing GAD Focal Point System (GFPSP) or similar 
mechanisms shall reconstitute and   strengthen said mechanisms based on the 
provisions of R.A. 9710, its IRR and this Memorandum Circular. 
 
Xxx 
Section 4.5 Agencies shall conduct periodic monitoring and evaluation of their 
GFPS and shall undertake measures to address possible issues hindering the 
performance of their functions in accordance with the MCW and other GAD-
related laws, policies and plans. 
 

109. Section 4.4 of Department of Budget and Management (DBM)/National Economic 
and Development Authority (NEDA)/National Commission on the Role of Filipino 
Women (NCFRW) Joint Circular No. 2004 – 1 requires that “GAD planning and 
budgeting shall be observed annually and incorporated in all programs and budget 
exercises of agencies. The GAD activities in the plan and budget must be included in the 
agency budget proposal in accordance with the budget call. Agencies shall ensure that the 
cost of implementing the GAD activities is part of their approved budget. At least five 
percent (5%) of the total agency budget appropriations as authorized under the annual 
General Appropriations Act shall correspond to activities supporting GAD. Agency heads 
shall be responsible for ensuring that GAD activities are provided with adequate 
resources.” 
 
110. Section 6.1 of GAD-PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular-2012-016 states that “At 
least five percent (5%) of the total agency budget appropriations authorized under the 
annual GAA shall correspond to activities supporting GAD plans and programs. The GAD 
budget shall be drawn from the agency’s Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses 
(MOOE), Capital Outlay (CO), and Personal Services (PS). It is understood that the GAD 
budget does not constitute an additional budget over an agency’s total budget 
appropriations.

111. Records as presented in Table 15 and Table 16 revealed that NCDA provided a 
total amount of P3,821,200.00 for its GPB which represents only 3.23% of its CY 2020 
appropriations of P118,171,000.00. However, AR disclosed that a total amount of 
P1,318,740.53, which represents only 1.12% of the total appropriation had been utilized 
for GAD PPAs integrating gender perspective in the operations of the Agency. 
 
112. In addition, Table 16 revealed that all of the accomplished PPAs were directed 
towards the prioritization of vulnerable women with disability. However, the accomplished 
PPAs have not met its planned budget and had utilized a lesser amount because of the 
constraints of COVID-19 protocols that prevented them to push through with the activities 
face to face, wherein only preparatory activities were executed and webinars/virtual/zoom 
platforms were done.  
 
113. The non-allocation of the mandatory requirement of at least five percent (5%) of 
the total appropriations and thereby, not being able to maximize the use of the allowed 
GAD budget, the appropriate program/projects/activities related to GAD were not 
undertaken to address gender issues. 
 
114. We recommended and Management agreed to strictly adhere to pertinent 
laws, rules and regulations relative to the preparation of the GPB and the AR. 
 
115. Management commented that the 5% budget is lodged or mainstreamed to the 
general programs of the Council.  No specific budget is available.

119. The NCDA failed to submit on time to COA the PCW-endorsed Annual GPB and 
AR for CY 2020, as prescribed under Section V of COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated 
March 18, 2014. The GPB and AR were only submitted to the Audit Team last March 24, 
2021, contrary to what was prescribed under Section 7.0 of PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint 
Circular No. 2012-01 on the Schedule to be observed in GAD Planning and Budgeting.  
 
120. Interview/verification with the GAD TWG Secretariat, the GPB for CY 2020 was 
submitted to the PCW but was returned with comments/corrections.  The revised GPB was 
sent back to PCW as instructed, but as of this report, it has not yet been returned to the 
NCDA. Despite the non-receipt of the GPB as approved by the PCW, the GAD Focal Point 
Management Committee implemented the planned programs/projects/activities (PPAs) 
because the financial aspect, time spent and efforts exerted will be put to waste and the 
supposed intended beneficiaries will not receive the benefits that will be derived from said 
PPAs, especially that these are gender-related and gender-sensitive. 
 
121. Hence, it is the responsibility of Management to submit to the COA Audit Team, a 
copy of the GPB and AR within five (5) working days from receipt of the approved plan 
from PCW or their mother or central office. Thus, the non-submission of approved plan 
and the Accomplishment Report within the timeframe specified prevented the conduct of 
a timely audit, review and validation of activities undertaken, as to: (i) compliance with 
applicable rules and regulations; and (ii) legality and completeness of information and 
documentation, among others. 
 
122. We recommended and Management agreed to require the GAD Focal Point 
Person to:  

 
a. endorse directly to PCW the GPB for review and approval, so that if there 

is any comment/recommendation/revision, it shall immediately be acted 
upon.  Likewise, to make follow-ups with the PCW on the status of the 
revised GPB submitted; 

 
b. submit on time, copy of the approved GPB and AR as endorsed by the 

PCW to the concerned offices for reference, including the COA office, so 
that timely review and audit of GPB will be conducted.  

 
123. Management commented that the 2020 GAD Plan was endorsed to the PCW but no 
approval was received from them. Since there was no comment or approval received from 
the PCW, the proponent deemed it approved. 
 
124. Moreover, the GAD Focal Person is retiring soon but we will ensure that proper 
turnover will be made on this matter and that the GAD Plan will be approved accordingly. 
 

Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs) 

 
125. The NCDA has substantially complied with the requirements of Section 32 of the 
General Provisions of the General Appropriations Act, FY 2020. The Agency provided 



59 
 

assistive devices such as wheelchairs and white canes, medical, educational and technical 
assistance to SCs and PWDs, and improving and maintaining the pathways and lifter 
located at the NCDA. 
 
Compliance with other Mandatory Accounts 

 
126. For CY 2020, Management faithfully complied with the withholding and 
remittance of deductions from the salaries of its personnel, the required taxes, premiums 
and loan installments, as well as the government share, and remitted the same within the 
prescribed period to the concerned institutions or agencies, in compliance with pertinent 
laws, rules, and regulations, as summarized in Table 17.

Compliance with 
Tax Laws 

Due to BIR BIR Revenue 
Regulation No. 2-98 
dated April 17, 1998 as 
amended by BIR 
Revenue Regulation 
No. 6-2001 dated July 
31, 2001 

The Agency withheld the amount of 
P2,560,600.66 from employees’ 
salaries and wages, contractors and 
suppliers, with a corresponding 
remittance of P2,560,600.66 to the 
BIR.  

Deduction and 
Remittance of 
GSIS premiums 

Due to GSIS Section 14 of the 
Implementing Rules 
and Regulations (IRR) 
of R.A. No. 8291 

The Agency withheld the amount of 
P2,338,254.14 from salaries and 
wages with a corresponding 
remittance of P2,338,254.14 to the 
GSIS.  

Deduction and 
Remittance of 
PhilHealth 
premiums 

Due to PhilHealth Section 19, Rule III of 
the Revised 
Implementing Rules 
and Regulations 
(RIRR) of R.A. No. 
7875 

The Agency withheld the amount of 
P229,437.29 from salaries and wages, 
with a corresponding remittance of 
P229,437.29 to the PhilHealth. 

Deduction and 
remittance of Pag-
IBIG premiums 

Due to Pag-IBIG Section 3, Rule VII of 
the IRR of R.A. No. 
9679 

The Agency withheld the amount of 
P885,663.12 from salaries and wages 
with a corresponding remittance of 
P885,663.12 to the Pag-IBIG.  

 
127. However, there were instances when the taxes withheld for the month were not 
remitted in full or there were over/under remittances, which could cause possible payment 
of penalties in the succeeding year which is considered disadvantageous to the government 
because additional/unnecessary expenses might be incurred.  
 
128. Interview with the Accountant revealed that under/over-remittances for CY 2020 
were due to the constraints brought about by COVID-19 protocols that made it impossible 
for her to report for work in the office or had a limited time to do it. According to her, the 
payroll for April and May 2020 were prepared in advance, as instructed by Management 
in anticipation of a stricter lockdown after March.  Therefore, the taxes recorded or 
withheld for March were significantly higher than the actual remittances for the 
month.  Moreover, since the Accountant was not able to report to the office to account for 



60 
 

the actual taxes withheld during the Enhanced Community Quarantine from March to May, 
the Council only made partial remittances of taxes for fixed expenses such as payments for 
security services, to comply with the BIR reporting requirements.   
 
129. On a separate note, the taxes from the initial salary of the newly appointed 
Executive Director were reported to BIR as early as July 2020 but actual withholding of 
tax was made only in August when his salaries were finally released. 
 
130. It is worthy to note, however, that the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) has given 
all government and private entities an extension for the filing of taxes during the period of 
the Enhanced Community Quarantine; thus, no penalties might be incurred during the 
period. 
 
131. We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to: 

 
a. religiously remit to the BIR all taxes withheld every month within the 

prescribed period set by the BIR; and 
 
b. strictly follow the BIR regulations to avoid the imminent incurrence of 

penalties. 
 
131. Management commented that the failure to remit in full the taxes withheld 
transpired during the sudden implementation of the Enhanced Community 
Quarantine/Modified Enhance Community Quarantine/General Community Quarantine 
from March to July 2020 wherein there were limited or absence of transportation services 
around Manila.  Although there was a delay in the payment of these taxes, it was justified 
under Revenue Regulations 11-2020 dated April 30, 2020 by the Bureau of Internal 
Revenue extending the deadline of payment of these taxes without penalties until June 09, 
2020.  Therefore, there was actually no violation committed.  The Accountant only made 
partial payments to BIR attributable to fixed expenses, such as security services, during 
these periods and she remitted in full the taxes due thereon when she reported back to office 
in June 2020 as the extension of deadline for filing of taxes became due. 
 
Hiring and payment of Job Order Personnel 

 
132. In CY 2020, under a Memorandum of Agreement, the Agency hired three (3) 
additional Job Order personnel composed of two (2) drivers and one (1) utility personnel 
equivalent to seven percent (7%) of the 41 regular plantilla employees, charged against the 
Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) account. 
 
Enforcement of Audit Suspensions, Disallowances and Charges 

 
133. The 2009 Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts (RRSA) requires 
the settlement of suspensions within ninety (90) calendar days from receipt of the Notice 
of Suspension (NS); otherwise, the transaction covered by it shall be disallowed/charged 
after the Auditor shall have satisfied himself that such action is appropriate. Consequently, 



61 
 

the Auditor shall issue the corresponding Notice of Disallowance (ND). The disallowance 
shall be settled within six (6) months from receipt of the ND by the persons liable. 
 
134. Audit disallowances found in the audit of various transactions of the NCDA as at 
December 31, 2020 amounted to P83,233.67 based on the Notice of Disallowance issued 
by this Commission as shown in Table 18:

of COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated September 15, 2009 re: Rules and Regulations on 
Settlement of Accounts (RRSA).  The Agency paid each official and employee their 
Performance Bonus totaling P520,800.00, which was disallowed in audit. As at December 
31, 2008, the amount of P455,800.04 was settled, thereby leaving the unsettled balance of 
P64,999.96. No settlement was made for the succeeding years. The officials and employees 
with unsettled amounts are either deceased or resigned, with no clearance secured from the 
Agency.
