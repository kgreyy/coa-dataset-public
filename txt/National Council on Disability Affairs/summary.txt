EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

A. Introduction 
 

The National Council on Disability Affairs (NCDA) is mandated to formulate 

policies and coordinate activities of all agencies, whether public or private, concerning 

disability issues and concerns.   

 

The NCDA aims to enable all persons with disabilities (PWDs) to attain their 

fullest potential and to become active contributors and participants in nation building. 

 

The Technical Staff/Secretariat provides the machine to coordinate functions, 

organize services and evaluate programs as may be required by the Board in the exercise 

of its functions.  An Executive Director, assisted by a Deputy Executive Director, heads 

the Secretariat, both are presidential appointees.  It is composed of five divisions, namely: 

1) Office of the Executive Director; 2) Programs Management Division (PMD); 3) 

Information, Education and Communication Division (IECD); 4) Technical Cooperation 

Center (TCC); and 5) Administrative Division (AD). 

 

To carry out its functions, the Council has a total itemized positions of 62, of 

which 41 are filled up, leaving 21 positions vacant as at year-end. In addition, the Council 

contracted three (3) workers through Memorandum of Agreement.  

    

B. Operational Highlights 
 

As the government’s focal Agency on all disability concerns, the NCDA has 

consistently led in promoting “Disability Inclusive Development” through policy 

formulation and program development to upscale engagement of Filipinos with 

disabilities, especially to the vulnerable members of the society which are in line with the 

10-Point Socioeconomic Agenda of Duterte’s Administration in achieving their 

“Inclusive growth” supportive to the DSWD Strategic Goals. This is also in sync with the 

Key Results Area on “Poverty Reduction and Empowerment of the Poor and 

Vulnerable.” 

 

With the vision of having “Filipinos with disabilities live in an inclusive, 

enabling, barrier-free and rights-based community by 2030”, the NCDA provides 

directions thru (a) policy formulation, program development, technical and resource 

augmentation services assistance, (b) coordination, consultation and partnership building, 

(c) advocacy and awareness raising, and (d) monitoring, research and evaluation. 

 

Along the CY 2020 Persons with Disability Rights Program, the Council has 

successfully updated, issued and disseminated 49 national policies, plans and programs 

related to the concerns of PWDs and were able to surpass their targets for CY 2020 by 

4.26 percent.

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the financial and compliance audits of the accounts and 

operations of NCDA for the year ended December 31, 2020.  The audit was conducted to: 



 

iii 

 

(a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed on Management’s assertions on the 

financial statements; (b) recommend Agency’s improvement opportunities; (c) determine 

the propriety of transactions as well as the extent of compliance with pertinent laws, rules 

and regulations; and (d) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit 

recommendations. 

 

E. Independent Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 
 

A qualified opinion was rendered on the financial statements of the NCDA as at 

December 31, 2020.  

 

F. Summary of Other Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 
 

The other significant observations and corresponding recommendations discussed 

in Part II of this report, are as follows: 

 

1. Non-preparation of the Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) on the 
inventories issued for the period, under the perpetual inventory system, is contrary to 

Section 17, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I that resulted in the unavailability of the 

real time information on the actual balance of the Office Supplies Inventory account.  

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require: 

 

a. The Supply Custodian to regularly prepare and submit the RSMI in 
compliance with Section 17, Chapter 8 of the GAM, Volume I; 

 

b. The Accountant to strictly observe the Perpetual Inventory Method in 
recording purchases and issuances as they take place; and 

 

c. The HR Officer to fast-track the hiring of a Supply Officer for a more 
effective execution of their duties and responsibilities. 

 

2. The procurement of the Inventory and Disposal System by the NCDA in CY 2019 for 
P449,000.00 was non-compliant with the provisions of the Revised Implementing 

Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of RA 9184 due to lapses in the procurement process. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the BAC to: (i) submit a 

justification why the contract was entered into without indicating technical 

specifications; and (ii)  strictly observe procurement laws, rules and regulations 

provided in RA 9184 and RIRR of 2016 and the Government Procurement 

Manual issued by the GPPB for the proper conduct of Government 

Procurement. 

 

3. Fourteen (14) sets of desktop computers totaling P593,465.60 delivered on August 
26, 2020, as part of NCDA’s Information System Strategic Plan (ISSP) Program 

remained in the stockroom and not yet issued to the end-users, thus, casting doubt on 



 

iv 

 

the necessity of the procured Information and Communications Technology (ICT) 

equipment, for the efficient discharge of the agency’s day-to-day operations. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. issue the existing ICT equipment to the end-users to maximize its use 
according to its purpose; and 

b. revisit the APP on the need to procure additional ICT equipment in the 
future to prevent unnecessary spending of government funds. 

 

4. Non-/delayed submission of supporting documents in the contract of agreement with 
a security services corporation and in the liquidation/replenishment of cash advances 

(CAs) or Petty Cash Fund (PCF) granted to accountable officers (AOs) affected the 

timely review and evaluation thereof by the Audit Team and cast doubts on the 

reliability and validity of the transactions. 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to: 

 

a. require the concerned officials to submit the lacking documents as identified 
above as well as the submission of the Contract of Agreement as prescribed 

in the above-cited provisions; otherwise, we shall be constrained to suspend 

in audit the transactions pertaining thereto;  

 

b. strictly comply with COA Circular No. 2017-001 on the proper usage of 

CENR which is only for expenses amounting to P300.00 or less and issue 

RER for expenses worth more than P300.00 in compliance with Item 3.3.1 of 

COA Circular No. 2004-006 dated September 9, 2004;  

 

c. ensure that purchases involving P1,000.00 and above be supported by 

canvasses from at least three (3) suppliers and strictly comply with Section 

36, Chapter 6 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I; 

 

d. secure certification/justification from the Head of Agency or his authorized 

representative that purchases involving P1,000.00 and above are emergency 

in nature; and 

 

e. use the PCF only for petty operating expenses.
