PART II - OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
 
FINANCIAL AUDIT 

 
Accounting Errors, Omissions and Misstatements 
 

1. Total misstatements amounting to ₱149,506,595.99 were found in Cash and Cash 
Equivalents, Receivables, Inventories, Property, Plant and Equipment, Other Assets 
and Liabilities accounts of the Technological University of the Philippines (TUP)-
System due to various accounting errors and omissions, thus affecting the fair 
presentation of the financial statements (FSs) as at December 31, 2020. 

 
1.1 Section 15, Chapter 2 of the Government Accounting Manual (GAM) for 

National Government Agencies (NGAs), Volume I, provides that “financial 
statements (FSs) shall present fairly the financial position, financial 
performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the 
faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and 
conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for 
assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses set out in PPSAS.1” 

 
1.2 Likewise, Section 111 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 states that “ (1) 

the accounts of the agency shall be kept in such detail as necessary to meet 
the needs of the agency and at the same time be adequate to furnish the 
information needed by the fiscal or control agencies of the government. (2) 
the highest standards of honesty, objectivity and consistency shall be 
observed in the keeping of accounts to safeguard against inaccurate or 
misleading information.” 

 
1.3 The consolidated FSs of TUP-System (TUP-S) comprises the FSs of the 

four Campuses of the University, namely: TUP-Manila (TUPM), TUP-
Taguig (TUPT), TUP-Cavite (TUPC), and TUP-Visayas (TUPV). 

 
1.4 Audit of various accounts of the TUP-S disclosed the following 

misstatements affecting the fair presentation of the consolidated FSs as at 
December 31, 2020, as shown below:

1.8 Review of the submitted reports disclosed a total net book  reconciling items 
of ₱19,733,270.74 were not yet adjusted in the books of  TUPV as 
summarized in Table 3.

1.9 From the above table, reconciling items totaling ₱19,733,270.74 have details 
or information disclosed as to their nature to ascertain the accounts affected 
by such misstatement due to their non-recording in the books. 
 

1.10 We recommended that Management of TUPV Campus, thru the 
Accountant: 
  
a. prepare the necessary adjustments for stale checks; and 

 
b. recognize in the books the reconciling items that have been duly 

verified so that they will not be carried over to the subsequent BRSs 
and submit to the Audit Team the copy of the Journal Entry 
Voucher (JEV) together with the documents supporting the said 
adjustments. 
 

 
RECEIVABLES 

 
1.11 The balance of Receivables account as at December 31, 2020 was  

overstated  by a net amount of ₱42,396,892.50 due to the following errors

 Net understatement 42,396,892.50   
       

1.12 Prudence is one of the qualitative characteristics of financial reporting 
which emphasizes caution in the exercise of judgement and does not allow 
“the deliberate understatement of assets or revenue, or the deliberate 
overstatement of liabilities or expenses, because the financial statements 
would not be neutral and, therefore, not have the quality of reliability,” 
(Section 6, Chapter 19, of the GAM, Volume I) 
 

1.13 Accounting errors are usual in financial reporting but an overstatement 
totaling ₱173,795,959.00 as presented in letter (b) from the above table is 
material enough to adversely affect the reliability of balances contained in 
the FS, with details in Table 5:

prepare the necessary adjustments to reflect the correct balances of the 
Receivables account and other affected accounts.

the correct amount and present fairly the balances in the FS. 



44 
 

1.19 The Management commented, thus: 
 

Campus Comments 
TUPT • The adjustment was not drawn immediately due to delayed submission of Property 

Acknowledgement Receipt (PAR) and Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR) to the 
Accounting Department for recording. Nonetheless, an adjustment was already made 
per JEV No. 21-02-0133 dated February 28, 2021. 

 
• The recording of construction of the Administration Building (Phase 1) cannot be 

undertaken as the Infrastructure and Development Office (IDO) did not furnish the 
Accounting Department the documents needed such as Certificate of Completion and 
Final Acceptance Report as basis of recording despite demand to provide the said 
documents. An adjustment will be made as soon as the documents are received. 

 
 

OTHER ASSETS 
 
1.20 The balance of Other Assets account as at December 31, 2020 was misstated 

by ₱334,953.20 due to the following errors/omissions:

amounting to ₱101,594.92 and ₱233,358.28, respectively. 

 
 
LIABILITIES  

 
1.22 The following are the misstatements found in the audit of transactions of the 

various Liabilities accounts, which the Management did not adjust in their 
books of accounts, thereby affecting the accuracy, completeness, and 
classification of the balances reflected in the FS as presented in Table 9:

Campus Recommendations 
TUPM a. maintain SL per program for each of the two agencies (DOST, CHED) to properly 

record/monitor the respective balances; and 
 
immediately make the adjusting entries to correct all affected accounts. 

TUPT b. prepare adjusting entries to correct the Payables on the purchased goods 
amounting to ₱249,446.00 and provide justification why the aforesaid purchases 
were paid prior to the delivery of the items and acceptance by the Property 
Officer; 
 

c. revert the long outstanding Accounts Payable under Fund 101 of ₱21,954.64 
pursuant to Section 98 of PD No. 1445 and EO No. 87, s. 2019; 
 

d. evaluate the Payables account under Fund 164; notify the concerned payees for 
replacement of checks subject to the presentation of stale checks and certification 
from the depository bank that the same were not negotiated/presented to them for 
encashment; and 
 

e. prepare/monitor the aging of Accounts Payable at least semi-annually to avoid 
accumulation of stale checks and delay in the reversion of such payable. 

 



46 
 

1.24 The Management commented, thus: 
 

Campus Comment 
TUPT • The Accounting Department already adjusted and recorded the Payables in the amount 

of ₱249,446.00 with JEV No. 21-01-0034 dated January 31, 2021. The Accounting 
Department was not able to record the Accounts Payable on time due to the absence of 
basis in recording since the Supply Office was not able to furnish timely the Report of 
Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) and Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR). 
 
The terms and mode of payment for the aforesaid payable are Cash on Delivery in 
which TUPT should prepare first the check before the supplier will deliver the goods. 
However, the Supplier’s policy is to wait for the check to be cleared which means that 
the money will be credited first to their account before they will deliver the goods. 
Hence, most of the goods were delivered late waiting for the clearing of check. In 
addition to this, the supplier preferred cash payment instead of extending credit terms to 
TUPT since this is unusual or a rare transaction, goods were only purchased from them 
annually or as the need arises. 
 

• In compliance with COA-DBM Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2021 dated March 8, 2021 and 
Executive Order No. 87, s. 2019, TUPT said that it will revert all documented Accounts 
Payable to the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) of the General Fund which remain 
outstanding for at least two years, for which no actual administrative or judicial claim 
has been filed. An initial adjustment has already been made per JEV No. 21-02-0089 
dated February 28, 2021. 
 
The various Payees listed in the schedule of accounts were informed through the 
Procurement Office and coordinators to submit a request for replacement, attached to it 
the stale checks. However, there are some Payees that cannot be contacted due to the 
absence of updated contact numbers.  

 
1.25 The Audit Team firmly maintains its position that, as a general rule, advance 

payment is not allowed under the existing rules and regulations on 
procurement, unless for emergency purposes. 

 
 
OTHER ACCOUNTING DEFICIENCIES  
 
Deficiencies in Cash and Cash Equivalents account 

 
2. CIB-LCCA balance of ₱860,435,424.19 is of doubtful accuracy due to 

incomplete/non-submission of Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS). Further, 
audit of Cash NT-MDS disclosed over recording of the receipt of Notices of 
Cash Allocation (NCAs) and variances in the amounts reported in the Report 
of Advice to Debit Account Issued (RADAI), Report of Disbursements (FAR 
No. 4) and Report of Checks Issued and RADAI, totaling ₱30,105,951.71. 

 
2.1 Section 74 of PD No. 1445, otherwise known as the State Audit Code of the 

Philippines, provides that “At the close of each month, depositories shall 
report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, the condition of 
the agency account standing on their books.  The head of the agency shall 



47 
 

see to it that reconciliation is made between the balance shown in the report 
and the balance found in the books of the agency.” 
 

2.2 Section 3, Chapter 21 (Bank Reconciliation) of the GAM for NGAs, 
Volume I, enumerates the objectives of the bank reconciliation, to wit:  
a) check correctness of both the bank’s and agency’s/entity’s records, 
b) serve as a deterrent to fraud, and 
c) enable the agency/entity or bank to take up charges or credits recognized 

by the bank or agency/entity but not yet known to the agency/entity or 
bank. 

 
2.3 Audit of Cash and Cash Equivalents account of TUPM disclosed certain 

lapses, deficiencies and internal control weaknesses as discussed below: 
 

a. Incomplete/non-submission of BRS 
 

2.4 Section 74 of PD No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing 
Code of the Philippines, provides that: “at the close of each month, 
depositories shall report to the agency head, in such form as he may direct, 
the condition of the agency account standing on their books. The head of the 
agency shall see to it that reconciliation is made between the balance shown 
in the reports and the balance found in the books of the agency.” 
 

2.5 Section 5, Chapter 21, of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, provides that “the 
Chief Accountant/Designated Staff shall within ten days from receipt of the 
monthly Bank Statement (BS) together with the paid checks, original copies 
of Debit Memoranda (DM)/Credit Memoranda (CM) from the Government 
Servicing Bank, reconcile the BS with the GL and prepare the BRS in four 
copies.” 

 
2.6 The TUPM has eight bank accounts which are all maintained at the Land 

Bank of the Philippines (LBP) – Taft Branch. In the reply sent by LBP, the 
bank confirmed the balances of the following accounts as at December 31, 
2020 as shown in Table 10:

accounts for CY 2020 were still unsubmitted as of this writing, except for 
MDS in which the latest BRS provided by the Accounting Department was 
up to November 2020. The details are shown below: 
 

Table 11. Deficiencies in the Submission of BRS 
Account Observation 

MDS The latest BRS submitted was as of November 2020 which was received by the Audit Team (AT) on February 10, 2021. 

TUP-PWF 

 The latest BRS submitted was as of December 31, 2019 duly received by 
the AT on October 12, 2020. The supporting BS in the BRS for the 
month of January 2019 was still not provided by the Accounting 
Department. 

ITRC 
The latest BRS submitted was as of December 31, 2019 duly received by 
the AT on October 12, 2020. However, the BRS for the month of June 
2019 still remained unsubmitted. 

STF The latest BRS submitted was as of December 2019 received by the AT on September 8, 2020.  

CHED StuFAP The latest BRS submitted was as of December 31, 2019 duly received by the AT on October 12, 2020. 

DOST Fund The latest BRS submitted was as of December 2019 received by the AT on October 12, 2020. 
SHS No BRS was submitted to the AT since CY 2016. 
Payroll Fund No BRS was submitted to the AT since CY 2016. 

 
2.8 The Accountant explained that the delay in the submission of the BRS is 

also due to delayed submission by LBP of the BSs. While it is true that the 
BRS is to be submitted to the Audit Team within 20 days from the receipt of 
BS as mentioned in Section 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, 
the TUPM may request for an advance copy of the BS thru its snapshots 
from the system of LBP to expedite the preparation and submission of BRS. 
 

2.9 Cash is the most susceptible asset for theft or misappropriation due to its 
liquidity. One of the control measures for the effective and efficient cash 
management and in order to prevent or at least minimize the risk of possible 
misappropriation of fund is by way of preparation of monthly BRSs, which 
must be duly supported with documents prepared in a regular and timely 
basis. 

 
2.10 Delayed submission of the monthly BRS defeats the purpose of achieving 

the desired result in reporting as to timeliness for its maximum usefulness, 
thereby affecting the immediate conduct of audit on the Cash accounts and 
prompt audit adjustments of deficiencies, if any. 
 

b. Deficiencies affecting CIB-MDS, Regular Account totaling ₱30,105,951.71 
 

2.11 Section 51, Chapter 19, of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 1 states that 
“adjustment for the unused Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) shall be made 
for fair presentation of the results of the operation of the entity in the 
financial statement.” 



49 
 

2.12 Section 55 of the same Chapter provides “the pro-forma entry for the 
reversion of the unused or unutilized NCA at the end of the accounting 
period for lapsed regular NCA and those issued for the payment of accounts 
payable/retirement gratuity/terminal leave,” as illustrated below: 

 
Subsidy from National Government 40301010 xxx  

Cash-MDS, Regular 10104040  xxx 
 

2.13 DBM-COA Joint Circular No. 2019-1 dated January 1, 2019 provides the 
updated guidelines relative to Budget and Financial Accountability Reports 
(BFARs) and prescribes the use of the Monthly Report of Disbursements 
(FAR No. 4) which is prepared by indicating all the authorized 
disbursements of the National Government Agencies. 
 

2.14 The MDS account was duly closed by the Accountant directly to the Equity 
account per JEV No. 20-12-534 dated December 31, 2020 amounting to 
₱3,752,193.11. The following deficiencies totaling P30,105,951.71, 
notwithstanding the absence of financial impact in the books as a result of 
the aforesaid reversal still affect the accuracy and reliability of how the 
transactions related to MDS is recognized in the books throughout the year:

Overstatement in 
the recorded 
receipt of Notices

(NCAs) 

The University received 10 NCAs for CY 2020 with a 
total amount of ₱351,840,006.00. Comparison of the 
NCAs with the recorded balances in the GJ disclosed 
that NCA No. NCA-NCR-20-0007446 dated June 29, 
2020 with a balance of ₱143,987,000.00 was 
recognized in the books at ₱63,124,000.00 and 
₱82,663,000.00 or for a total of ₱145,787,000.00, per 
JEV Nos. 20-07-278 and 20-10-385, respectively, 
resulting in the overstatement of ₱1,800,000.00.

Variance between 
the Report of 
Advice-to-Debit

Analyses of the latest BRSs for MDS Account revealed 
that there was a variance of ₱1,000.00 between the 
RADAI and the disbursements that were already 
charged and debited by the bank on the Cash-MDS, 
Regular Account. 
 
The disparity pertained to ADA No. 9920000065 dated 
July 8, 2020 amounting to ₱908,762.41 as recorded in 
the books and was debited by the bank on July 10, 
2020 amounting to ₱907,762.41.

differ from the disbursements from RCI/RADAI with 
an aggregate amount of ₱349,888,812.89, resulting in a 
variance of ₱28,304,951.71. From the aforesaid 
discrepancy, it was observed that the ADAs issued for 
the month of August 2020 amounting to 
₱27,585,919.23 was not posted in FAR No. 4. 

28,304,951.71

2.15 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. submit the BRS within three months to the Audit Team, together 
with all the supporting documents, of all the bank accounts of the 
University in accordance with Sections 5 and 7, Chapter 21 of the 
GAM for NGAs, Volume I; 
 

b. coordinate with the LBP to facilitate the delivery of the BSs, and 
eventually for the timely preparation and submission of BRS to the 
Audit Team. If circumstances dictate that the BSs cannot be 
provided immediately, request for snapshots of bank accounts at 
least within seven (days) after the end of each month to avoid 
significant delays or non-submission of BRS; 

 
c. submit the BRS since CY 2016 to the Audit Team, within three 

months from receipt hereof,  and in case of non-submission, impose 
the withholding of salaries of the officials and employees concerned 
until they shall have complied with the requirement, pursuant to the 
provision of Section 122 of PD No. 1445; 

 
d. explain the variances noted between the RADAI and BS amounting 

to ₱1,000.00 and Report of Disbursements (FAR No. 4) and 
RCI/RADAI amounting to ₱28,304,951.71 and reflect the correct 
figures in the concerned reports, if warranted; and  
 

e. carefully recognize the receipt of NCAs for proper accounting of the 
status thereof and be accurate in the reporting of cash allocations to 
prevent variances of figures in related reports. 

 
 
Unreliable balance of Receivables account 
 
3. The Receivables account balance of ₱458,145,485.78 is unreliable due to             

a) misclassification of account in recognizing the billing of TUPT for the 3rd 
term of the  Academic Year (AY) 2019-2020 as well as the payment for the 2nd 
term AY 2019-2020 amounting to ₱15,029,895.00 and ₱14,698,340.00, 
respectively,  under Accounts Receivable instead of Due from Central Office 
account; b) lack/absence of internal control system for the effective and 
efficient implementation of programs under the Universal Access to Quality 
Tertiary Education (UAQTE); c) non-maintenance of a separate bank account 
for the Free Higher Education (FHE), Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) and 
Student Loan Program; and  d) inadequacy in the maintenance of Subsidiary 
Ledger (SL), thus runs counter with the provisions of  RA No. 10931 or the 
“UAQTE Act of 2017.”  
 
3.1 RA No. 10931, the “Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act 

(UAQTE) of 2017” also known as the Free Higher Education (FHE) Act- “an 



51 
 

act promoting universal access to quality tertiary education by providing free 
tuition and other school fees in State Universities and Colleges (SUCs), Local 
Universities and Colleges (LUCs), and State-Run Technical-Vocational 
Institutions (TVETs), establishing the Tertiary Education Subsidy and Student 
Loan Program, strengthening the Unified Student Financial Assistance System 
for Tertiary Education (UniFAST), and appropriating fund thereof.” 
 

3.2 The UniFAST, was created under RA No. 10687 “to implement, reconcile, 
improve, strengthen and put under one body all-government-funded modalities 
of Student Financial Assistance Programs (StuFAPs) for tertiary education and 
special purpose education assistance in both public and private institutions.” 
Relatively, UniFAST issued Memorandum Circular No. 2018-002 dealing with 
the Guidelines on FHE in Philippine State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) 
and CHED-Recognized Local Universities and Colleges (LUCs). The 
guidelines cited two options available to SUCs and CHED-recognized LUCs 
for the method of disbursements, namely: Fund transfer with the initial 50 
percent based on the computed budget ceiling (subject to liquidation) 
recommended by UniFAST as stipulated in Section 53, Rule IX of the IRR and 
billing system wherein the tuition and other school fees of actual qualified 
enrolled in SUCs and CHED-recognized LUCs will be billed to UniFAST for 
settlement. TUP adopted the second option. 

 
3.3 Presented in Table 14 are the deficiencies noted through the course of the 

audit of the Receivables account, specifically Due from NGAs account and 
the implementation of the Program in TUP: 
 

Table 14.Deficiencies in UniFAST Implementation 
Campus Deficiencies Particulars 

TUPT Misclassification 
of account in 
recognizing the 
billing for the 3rd 
term of the  
Academic Year 
(AY) 2019-2020 
as well as the 
payment for the 
2nd term AY 
2019-2020 
amounting to   
₱15,029,895.00 
and 
₱14,698,340.00, 
respectively, 
under Accounts 
Receivable 
instead of Due 
from Central 
Office account 

TUPT courses all its FHE-related reports and transactions through 
TUPM Campus. Billing statements were prepared and forwarded to 
TUPM for consolidation and submission to the UniFAST. All funds 
related to this purpose were released by the CHED to TUPM for 
distribution to all TUP campuses based on the campuses’ billing 
details.  
 
Billings of the FHE were previously recorded in Due from NGAs 
account, however the Audit Team recommended, after consultation 
with the Government Accounting Sector (GAS) to transfer the set-up 
of the receivables for the billed tuition fees and other school fees to 
Due from Central Office Account since TUPT communicates 
directly to TUPM and not with CHED UniFAST.  This was 
conveyed to the Management through the issuance of an Audit 
Observation Memorandum. 
 
Audit of JEV No. 20-10-771 dated October 31, 2020 showed that the 
billing for 3rd term AY 2019-2020 of ₱15,029,895.00 was recorded 
in Accounts Receivable. The same account was also used to record 
the payment for the 2nd term of AY 2019-2020 amounting to 
₱14,698,340.00. Both transactions should have been recorded to Due 
from Central Office account.

Table 14.Deficiencies in UniFAST Implementation 
Campus Deficiencies Particulars 
TUPM Lack/absence of 

internal control 
system for the 
effective and 
efficient 
implementation 
of programs 
under the 
UAQTE 

TUP-Manila is the focal point for all the campuses, thus all FHE 
billing statements and funds go through TUP-Manila first before 
submission to UniFAST or distribution to other campuses. Being the 
focal point for all the FHE related activities and transactions 
necessitates a control system that encompasses adequate monitoring 
and review for the effective implementation of the FHE.  
 
In this regard, TUP created a UniFAST committee, by virtue of TUP 
Order No. 89 s. 2018 and TUP Order No. 02 s. 2019, to “take charge 
on all UniFAST matters, facilitate all related transactions and 
coordinate closely with CHED and other offices regarding UniFAST 
concerns. It shall convene accordingly and design its own 
mechanisms of performing its mandate and to harmonize the scope 
of its member’s tasks.”  
 
However, no formal policies and procedures were established yet to 
properly segregate the functions of its members, guide other 
campuses for an organized and timely process of submission or even 
coordinate proper recording of their intra-agency transfers. This lack 
of formal policies and procedures hinders the harmonization of roles 
and even prohibits sufficient oversight and review on the potential 
problems that may arise during the whole process of implementing 
FHE. 

Non-
maintenance of a 
separate bank 
account 

Section 1.4 (d3), Rule II of the tripartite Memorandum of 
Agreement, signed by TUP, CHED and UniFAST on June 13, 2018 
requires the maintenance of a separate bank account for the FHE, 
TES, and SLP but the Management did not maintain a new account 
and, instead, uses the Special Trust Fund (STF) account for funds 
received under RA No. 10931. 
 

Inadequacy in 
the maintenance 
of SL 

As at December 31, 2020, the General Ledger (GL) of Due from 
NGAs account for TUPM showed a total balance of 
₱245,085,060.62 composed of the following: 
 

Particulars Balance  (In PhP) 
Advance payments to DBM-PS for the procurement 
of Common-Use Supplies and Equipment (CSE) 

956,509.12 

Billings to CHED for Free Higher Education 182,838,350.50  
Fund transfer to the Department of Public�Works 
and Highways (DPWH) for the construction of the 
Administration Building 

61,290,201.00  

Total 245,085,060.62  
 
The above balances were accounted in one SL that contains all the 
transactions associated with the three different government agencies 
— DBM, CHED and DPWH.  
 
While the Accounting Department may have complied with 
Appendix 6, of the GAM, Volume II that requires the maintenance 
of SL, the same, however, does not show details for each account in 
the GL and as such, does not serve the purpose of providing detailed 
and on hand information for ready reference.  The balances per 
agency concerned cannot be determined immediately without 



53 
 

Table 14.Deficiencies in UniFAST Implementation 
Campus Deficiencies Particulars 

recomputing and tracing prior year transactions and balances to 
arrive at and/or confirm the reported figures. Maintaining one SL for 
all the transactions of the three offices does not promote operational 
efficiency and effective monitoring especially when it comes to FHE 
unpaid billings to CHED where transactions are varied and 
voluminous. Proper procedures and control in recording should be in 
place to ensure reliability of financial reporting consistent with rules 
and regulations. 

 
3.4 We recommended that Management: 

 
a. reclassify the amount of ₱15,029,895.00 pertaining to the 3rd term of 

AY 2019-2020 as well as the ₱14,698,340.00 payment for the 2nd 
term of the same AY that were erroneously recorded in the 
Accounts Receivable account; 

 
b. create policies and procedures that set forth the functions and 

responsibilities of each committee member, the deadline of 
submission for other campuses as well as the suggested pro forma 
entries in recording the FHE transactions; 

 
c. maintain separate bank accounts each for the FHE, TES and SLP as 

required in the  MOA dated June 13, 2018; and 
 

d. maintain SLs for each of the three agencies (DBM, CHED, DPWH) 
to properly monitor their balances. 

e.  
3.5 Management commented, thus: 

 
Campus Comments 

TUPT The misclassification of accounts in recognizing the billing for the 3rd term of 
the AY 2019-2020 as well as the payment for the 2nd term AY 2019-2020 
amounting to ₱15,029,895.00 and ₱14,698,340.00, respectively, was already 
reclassified to the proper account with JEV Nos. 21-01-0063 and 21-01-0064 
respectively. 
 
The billings of tuition and other school fees for FHE Act were prospectively 
recorded to Due from Central Office Account. 

 
 
Doubtful validity of Inventories Account 
 
4. The correctness of Inventories account as at December 31, 2020 amounting to 

₱81,570,543.78 is doubtful due to: a) variances  between the Accounting 
Department and Property and Supply Office (PSO) records on purchases and 
issuances of inventories amounting to  P2,611,675.77 and P11,985,372.24, 
respectively, in TUPM and  ₱116,710.81 between the FS balance and the RPCI in 



54 
 

TUPV; b) misclassification in the recording of the acquisition of inventory 
items totaling ₱54,568.80; c) non-adoption of the perpetual inventory system of 
recording supplies  and materials evidenced by non-maintenance of Supply 
Ledger Cards (SLCs) by the Accounting Department and updated Stock Cards 
(SCs) by the PSO for each item in stock; and d) non-conduct of physical count 
of inventory at least semi-annually, contrary to Chapter 8 of the GAM for 
NGAs, Volume I, thereby affected the reliability of the reported balance of the 
account in the FSs. 

 
4.1 Pertinent provisions in Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, are as 

follows:  
 
Section 9 - “Perpetual Inventory Method. Supplies and materials 
purchased for inventory purpose shall be recorded using the perpetual 
inventory system, resulting in a more accurate inventory records and a 
running total for the cost of goods sold in each period. The system requires 
accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times 
through the maintenance of the SLC (Appendix 57) by the Accounting 
Division and Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) by the Supply and/or Property 
Division /Unit for each item in stock.  Regular purchases shall be coursed 
through the inventory account and issues thereof shall be recorded as they 
take place except for supplies and materials purchased out of PCF for 
immediate use or on emergency cases which shall be charged directly to the 
appropriate expense accounts.”  
 
Section 13 – “Inventory Accounting System. xxx Physical count/inventory, 
which is required semi-annually, is an indispensable procedure for 
checking the integrity of property custodianship.” (Emphasis supplied) 
 
Section 17 – “Records, Forms and Reports to be prepared and/or 
maintained. The following are the pertinent records, forms and reports, 
among others, that are prescribed for use: 
 
b. Stock Card (SC) (Appendix 58) – shall be used to record all receipts 
and issues of supplies and the balance in quantity at any time. It shall 
be maintained by the Property and/or Supply Division/Unit for each 
item in stock. The IAR, RIS, PO and DR serve as the original sources of 
information for making entries on the card.  
 
c. Supplies Ledger Card (SLC) (Appendix 57) – shall be used to record 
materials received, issued and the balance both in quantity and amount at 
any time. It shall be maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit for each 
kind of supplies and materials. The IAR, RIS, RSMI, PO and DR serve as the 
original sources of information for making entries on the card.  
 
xxx 



55 
 

j. Inspection and Acceptance Report (IAR) (Appendix 62) – shall be used for 
inspection and acceptance of purchased and delivered property, supplies 
and materials.” 
 
g. Report of Supplies and Materials Issued (RSMI) (Appendix 64) – shall be 
prepared by the Property and/or Supply Custodian based on the RIS and 
shall be used by the Accounting Division/Unit as basis in preparing the JEV 
to record the supplies and materials issued.  
 
xxx 
 
i. Report on the Physical Count of Inventories (RPCI) (Appendix 66) – shall 
be used to report the physical count of supplies by type of inventory as at a 
given date. It shows the balance of inventory items per card and per count 
and shortage/overage, if any. These include the semi-expendable property 
wherein the issue is covered by ICS. 

 
4.2 The correctness of the Inventories account balance is doubtful due to the 

following deficiencies, as shown in Table 15:

existent as at yearend based on the RPCI prepared by the PSO, however, 
the FS as of December 31, 2020 did not account for the same. 
 
Furthermore, the FS reported certain inventories amounting to 
₱358,333.30 (i.e., accountable forms; medical, dental and laboratory 
supplies; fuel, oil and lubricants and textbooks and instructional materials) 
which were not included in the RPCI submitted by the PSO. Upon inquiry 
with the Head of the PSO, it was explained that no such inventories exist 
as of December 31, 2020, the reason why they were not included in the 
RPCI.

Pertinent Sections in Chapter 3 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume III are as 
follows:  
 
Semi-Expendable Information and Communications Technology 
Equipment - This account is used to recognize the cost/fair value of the 
purchased/acquired information and communications technology 
equipment, which includes laptops, printers, scanners, and the like, costing 
less than ₱15,000 for the use in government operations.” 
 
Other Supplies and Materials Inventory - This account is used to recognize 
the cost of purchased/acquired supplies and materials not falling under any 
of the specific inventory accounts held for consumption. 
There were 18 portable hard drives purchased from DBM – Procurement 
Service totaling ₱54,568.80 which were classified as Other Supplies and 
Materials Inventory instead of Semi-Expendable-IT Equipment, contrary 
to the abovementioned Manual.

TUPM 
No SLCs were maintained by the Accounting Department to record 
materials received, issued and the balance both in quantity and amount.  
The PSO maintained SCs but were only updated as of December, 
2018, however, e-copy of the SCs were maintained as of December 
2019. In addition, the Supply Officer issues/maintains Inventory 
Custodian Slip (ICS) as a proof of issuance of the semi-expendable 
items to the end-users. 
 
TUPT 
The SLCs were maintained by the Accounting Department but not in 
the format prescribed in Appendix 57 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume 
II. Instead, the Department prepared schedules of inventories wherein 
only the acquisition and issuances were posted. 
 
TUPV 
Inquiry with the Accounting Department revealed that SLCs are 
not being maintained, which are necessary to monitor and facilitate 
the reconciliations of records. 

TUPT Non-conduct of 
physical count 
of inventory at 
least semi-
annually 

Physical count was not done semi-annually as required in Chapter 8, 
Section 13 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. Therefore, the reliability 
of the reported balance was not established. Further inquiry with the 
Property Officer revealed that TUPT had conducted a physical count 
in September and November 2019 but only 60 percent of the total 
inventories were counted. 

 
4.3 We recommended that Management:

a. reconcile reports/records between the Accounting and PSO, and correct the 
discrepancy to establish existence as well as the validity of the reported book 
balances; 
 

b. maintain and update SLCs to record supplies and materials received, issued 
and balances both in quantity and amount pursuant to Section 17 of the GAM 
for NGAs, Volume I;

purchased and observe completeness of the necessary information such as 
receipts, issuances and balance of supplies; 
 

d. reclassify Portable External Hard Drives to Semi-Expendable IT Equipment; 
and 

TUPT e. conduct the physical count of inventories semi-annually and prepare and 
submit the RPCI as required in Chapter 8 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 
4.4 The Management commented, thus: 

 
Campus Comment 

TUPT The PSO had prepared RSMI pending the availability of signatories to sign the 
documents. Once signed, this will be forwarded to the Accounting Department for 
recording purposes. Moreover, physical count of inventories is scheduled to be 
conducted in June 2021 and inventory report as a result thereof will be provided. 

 
 
Unascertained reliability of Property, Plant and Equipment Account balance 
 
5. The reliability of PPE as at December 31, 2020 with an aggregate amount of 

₱1,416,218,876.98, which represents 49.67 percent of the total assets, cannot be 
ascertained due to: a) inadequacy of records and reports to substantiate the 
same and the huge variance of ₱748,671,370.43 between the Accounting and 
Property records; b) non-reconciliation of records despite the conduct of the 
physical count of PPE; c) non-maintenance of prescribed report necessary to 
account for PPE;  d) absence of Lapsing Schedule to establish correct 
valuation and depreciation of depreciable assets; and e) recording of items 
prior to their delivery.  Further, in case of loss of equipment, answerability 
thereon by the actual responsible person is not assured as Property 
Acknowledgement Receipts (PARs) were not renewed at least every three 
years or every time there is a change in ownership.  
 
5.1 The handbook on Internal Control Structure (ICS) described the financial 

controls or accounting controls as those methods and procedures used to 
produce accurate records and safeguard assets. The ICS should be designed 
to ensure that: 
a) Specified individuals are held accountable for transactions under their 

control 
b) Accounting records are accurately and reliably maintained; and 
c) There are adequate checking and reconciling procedures. 

 
5.2 Below are the pertinent provisions of Chapter 10 (Property, Plant and 

Equipment), GAM for NGAs, Volume I: 
 
Section 21 – “Issue of PPE. Based on approved Requisition and Issuance 
Slip (RIS), the Supply and/or Property Custodian shall prepare the PAR 



59 
 

(Appendix 72) to support the issue of property to end-user.  The PAR shall 
be renewed at least every three years or every time there is a change in 
accountability or custodianship of the property.” 
 
Section 38 – “Physical Count of PPE. The entity shall have a periodic 
physical count of PPE, which shall be done annually and presented on the 
Report on the Physical Count of Property, Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) 
(Appendix 71) as at December 31 of each year.  This shall be submitted to 
the Auditor concerned not later than January 31 of the following year. 
Equipment found at station and losses discovered during the physical count 
shall be reported to the Accounting Division/ Unit for proper accounting 
/recording.” 
 
Section 40 – “Idle, Unserviceable and Fully Depreciated PPE.                            
All unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection 
Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74).  PPE reported in 
the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-
Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated 
Depreciation)” 
 
Section 42 – “Accounting and Property Records to be maintained for 
PPE. The Chief Accountant shall maintain the PPELC for each category of 
PPE including work and other animals, livestock, etc.   The PPELC shall be 
kept to record promptly the acquisition, description, custody, estimated life, 
depreciation, impairment, disposal, transfer/adjustment, repair, history and 
other information about the asset.  For check and balance, the PSO shall 
likewise maintain Property Cards (PC) for PPE in their custody to account 
for the receipt and disposition of the same. The balance per PC shall be 
reconciled with PPELC maintained by the Accounting Division/Unit.  They 
shall also be reconciled with the property records like Property 
Acknowledgement Report (PAR).” 

 
5.3 Appendix 77 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume II provides that “The 

Construction in Progress Ledger Card (CIPLC) shall be kept in the 
Accounting Division/Unit for each project. The Accounting Staff in charge 
in maintaining the CIPLC shall record promptly the construction costs and 
other information about the asset constructed. It shall be maintained per 
fund cluster.” 
 

5.4 Comparison between the GL of the Accounting Department and the

despite the 
conduct of the 
physical count 
of PPE 

TUPM 
 
A physical count of property was conducted this 
year after seven years of no physical inventory 
taking, however, no reconciliation of records with 
the Accounting Department was made, hence 
resulting in a remarkable variance in the amount 
presented in the financial statement.  A soft copy of 
RPCPPE as of December 31, 2020 was submitted 
to the Audit Team. 
 
TUPT 
One (1) Document Camera Aver Vision F-17 8M 
with Serial No. 5309545200175 costing ₱32,000.00 
was recorded under the Technological and 
Scientific Equipment by the Accounting 
Department but the same was presented under 
Other Machineries and Equipment in the RPCPPE 
prepared by the PSO. 
 
TUPC 
Reconciliation is an audit tool which aims to 
determine if the amount recorded in the books 
tallies with the RPCPPE by the Property Unit and 
thus it could be ascertained if the account could be 
relied upon. 
 
Verification disclosed that the discrepancy in the 
balances was caused by non-reconciliation of 
property records between the Accounting and the 
Property Unit as of December 31, 2020. Moreover, 
the Power Supply System account amounting to 
₱8,374,085.81 was not included in the RPCPPE. 
 
TUPV 
Review of the RPCPPE revealed that numerous 
items costing less than ₱15,000.00 are included in 
the RPCPPE, instead of RPCI.

Lapsing schedule for PPE was not maintained

Lapsing schedule is a spreadsheet that lists the 
purchase date, depreciation, and other accounting 
actions such as additional acquisitions and 
disposition related to a fixed asset. The intent of the 
schedule is to show the rate at which the book value 
of a fixed asset declines over time. Thus, the Audit 
Team cannot identify the correct valuation of the 
depreciation since the acquisition cost and date of 
each property could not be identified.

The Accountant disclosed that in order to ensure 
that the budget allotted to TUPV is maximized, 
checks are already drawn prior to delivery of the 
goods in order to avoid reversion of the funds to the 
National Treasury.  
 
As such, at the time the checks are drawn and 
vouchers were prepared, an asset account is already 
being recorded. This is done despite the 
items/goods procured were not yet delivered by the 
supplier and inspected/accepted by the PSO.

5.7 The continuous disregard of the Management of the existing regulations on 
property management particularly the requirement on the physical inventory 
taking, regular reconciliation of records and maintenance of Property Cards 
contributed to the difficulty in ascertaining the reliability of figures 
presented in the FSs as at December 31, 2020. 

 
5.8 We recommended that Management:

a. reconcile the variance between the Accounting and Property records 
in order to come up with correct balance of the PPE 

TUPM

TUPV 

d. comply with the rules and regulations on Property Management 
outlined in the GAM for NGS, Volume I for the accounting policies, 
guidelines and procedures and Volume II for the maintenance of the 
required reports and records. 

TUPV e. direct the Accounting Department to record procurements to their 
proper asset account only upon receipt of the IAR and its supporting 
document prepared by PSO, and not at the time checks are drawn; 
 

f. direct the PSO to transfer the semi-expendable properties (properties 
costing less than ₱15,000.00) included in the RPCPPE to the RPCI. 
Update its Property Card and Stock Card for the adjustment made. A 
separate Stock Card should be prepared for each class of semi-
expendable properties; 
 

g. avail of the one-time cleansing of PPE Account Balances of 
Government Agencies pursuant to COA- Circular No. 2020-006 dated 
January 31, 2020; and 

TUPM h. suspend the salaries of the officials and employees concerned with the 
non-submission of the above cited reports until they shall have 
complied with the requirements pursuant to Section 122 of PD No.

5.9 The Management commented, thus: 

 
Campus Comments 

TUPT PARs are already updated by the PSO but no signature yet from the end user 
since some of them are not required to report to the office. It will be furnished 
once signed. 

TUPV The Management committed to comply with all the recommendations 
provided. The university also declared that they will be availing of the one-
time cleansing of the PPE. Management committed to see to it that by 
December 31, 2021 the records of the accounting and property unit will be 
accurate. 



63 
 

Inaccurate balance of Other Non-Current Assets Account Balance 
 
6. The Other Non-Current Asset Account balance of ₱18,013,356.46 as at 

yearend is inaccurate as ₱12,778,883.90 thereof pertains to undisposed obsolete 
and unserviceable properties already reported in the Inventory and Inspection 
Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) which included the ₱7,695,535.69 
acquired value of donated properties in CY 2006 from the Population 
Commission,. 

 
6.1 Section 79 of PD No. 1445 provides the manner of disposing unserviceable 

property either by destruction if found to be valueless or unsaleable or sale 
thru public auction or private sale if found to be valuable. 
 

6.2 COA Circular No. 89-296 states that the full and sole authority and 
responsibility for the divestment or disposal of property and other assets 
shall be lodged in the heads of the departments, bureaus and offices of the 
national government. 
 

6.3 DBM National Budget Circular No. 425, otherwise known as the Manual on 
Disposal of Government Property, dated January 28, 1992 provides that the 
disposal proceedings shall be immediately initiated to avoid further 
deterioration of the property and consequent depreciation in its value. A 
systematic and timely disposal will yield benefits of, among others, a higher 
appraised value and by enabling storage areas available for other purposes. 
 

6.4 Section 40.d, Chapter 10 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provides that all 
unserviceable property shall be reported in the Inventory and Inspection 
Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) (Appendix 74). PPE reported in 
the IIRUP shall be dropped from the books by debiting Impairment Loss-
Property, Plant and Equipment (cost of the PPE less Accumulated 
Depreciation). 
 

6.5 Verification of the Other Assets account of TUPT disclosed that it was not 
able to dispose obsolete and unserviceable properties amounting to 
₱12,778,883.90 as at yearend. Further observation has shown that out of the 
total undisposed property, ₱7,695,535.69, which comprise of 260 items, 
pertains to properties donated by the Population Commission (PopCom) in 
2006 and became unserviceable due to obsolescence.  
 

6.6 According to the PSO of TUPT, the donated properties from PopCom, 
except for the video recorders, have never been used as there were set-ups 
that require installation of additional accessories before they become 
operational which were not provided at the time the properties were 
donated. As of date, the IIRUP was already prepared for these items but still 
not inspected and appraised by the Disposal and Appraisal Committee. 

 



64 
 

6.7 We recommended that Management of TUPT: 
 
a. complete the inventory of the remaining unserviceable properties 

and prepare the IIRUP for proper reporting, disposal and 
derecognition thereof in accordance with existing regulations; 

 
b. fast-track the inspection and appraisal of the unserviceable 

properties covered by the IIRUP and recommend to the Campus 
Director the mode of disposal to be adopted after determining the 
actual status of the disposable properties; and 
 

c. forward the IIRUP together with supporting documents to the Audit 
Team for endorsement to the Technical Audit Office, Technical 
Services Office, COA for technical review and evaluation. 

 
 
Unascertained correctness of Liabilities Account Balance 
 
7. The correctness of the Liabilities account balance at yearend of 

₱362,897,957.92 is unascertained due to: a) delayed liquidation of funds 
transferred ranging from 16 to 311 days amounting to ₱15,841,000.00, which 
cannot be determined if already expended/distributed to Tertiary Education 
Subsidy (TES) and TES – Expanded Students’ Grant-in-Aid Program for 
Poverty Alleviation (ESGP-PA) beneficiaries for the AY 2018-2019 due to 
absence of documents;  and b) inconsistencies of balances reflected in various 
records. 

 
7.1 Analysis of the recorded transactions on Liabilities account disclosed 

deficiencies, which were contrary to rules and regulations, as follows: 
 

Table 18. Summary of Accounting Deficiencies Affecting Liabilities Account

TUPM Delayed liquidation 

of funds transferred 
by CHED to the 
University ranging 
from 16 to 311 days 
amounting to 
₱15,841,000.00 

Confirmation of the balances of fund transfers received 
by the University from CHED revealed that out of the 
total transferred funds of ₱28,680,125.00 as of December 
31, 2020, only ₱12,838,725.00 was liquidated hence 
could be construed that the same had been distributed to 
qualified students, leaving an unliquidated balance of 
₱15,841,400.00.  
 
After the submission of the Fund Utilization Report of 
both TES beneficiaries and TES - ESGP-PA for the AY 
2018-2019 on November 29, 2019 totaling 
₱12,838,725.00, all subsequent fund transfers from 
CHED remained undistributed to date or if distributed, 
has no supporting documents evidencing the receipt of 
funds by the qualified students. 
 



65 
 

Table 18. Summary of Accounting Deficiencies Affecting Liabilities Account 
Campus Deficiency Particulars 

Inquiry with the Scholarship Coordinator disclosed that 
CHED does not inform the TUP when funds were already 
transferred to the TUP’s account despite continuous 
follow ups to the UniFAST Coordinator, hence incurring 
delays in the distribution and liquidation processes. The 
delay deprived the student-grantees of the financial 
assistance/benefits that could have been derived 
therefrom had the allowances been timely given. 
 
This is contrary to Section XVI of JMC No. 04, s. 2020 
which requires the public HEIs, the SUCs and CHED-
recognized LUCs to submit the required documents to 
CHEDROs within 60 days from receipt of funds released 
to them either through the List of Due and Demandable 
Accounts Payable with Advice to Debit Account 
(LDDAP-ADA) or through checks. 

TUPT Inconsistencies of 
balances reflected in 
various records 

• Variance of  ₱200.00 between the recorded payment/ 
settlement of payable as against the recorded amount 
used in setting up the liability  
 
The payable for the subscriptions of magazines/ 
newspapers from Paperus Trading per Charge Invoice 
No. 134 dated January 5, 2019 was initially set up for 
₱1,459.00 under GJ No. 19-01-0051 dated January 15, 
2019.  However, under Check No. 477027 dated 
December 26, 2019, the payment made for the 
settlement of the said payable was reduced to ₱1,259.00 
due to the reduction in the unit cost of one of the items 
purchased. A new invoice, Charge Invoice No. 0327 
also dated January 5, 2019 was issued to that effect 
resulting in the overstatement of the A/P by ₱200.00. 
 

• Variance between Check Disbursement Journal 
(ChkDJ) and General Ledger (GL) amounting to 
₱5,791.07 
 
Comparison of the debit balances posted in the GL 
under Fund 164 for the months of March and December 
2020 amounting to ₱65,186.00 and ₱1,422,051.80, 
respectively, as against the ChkDJ amounting to 
₱64,872.21 and ₱1,428,156.66, respectively, showed a

7.2 We recommended that Management: 
 

Campus Recommendations 
TUPM a. immediately distribute allowances to the student-grantees and provide proof 

that the allowance were transferred if thru Automated Teller Machine (ATM) 
and payroll report signed by the recipients if thru cash advance; 

 
b. make formal letters with CHED-UniFAST Coordinator to follow up any 

pending results of assessment and/or to be regularly informed if payment of 
TES scholarship for any semester has already been transferred to the 
University; and 

 
c. strictly comply with Section XVI of JMC No. 04, s. 2020 on the liquidation of 

funds transferred. 
TUPT d. reconcile the disbursements posted in the GL and ChkDJ and reflect the 

appropriate balances. 
 

7.3 The Management commented, thus: 
 

Campus Comment 
TUPT The Accounting Department had coordinated with the Supplier long ago to submit a 

new sales invoice before payment is made since there was a change of price in one 
item, however, no response was received. The Librarian will be informed to contact the 
supplier if it is still interested to claim the unpaid accounts payable amounting to 
₱200.00, if not, it will be reverted back to Accumulated Surplus/Deficit to close the 
payable account. 

 
 
Unascertained accuracy of Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) Account 
 
8. The comparative FSs of the TUP-S as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 were not 

fairly presented due to non-compliance with the retrospective restatement of 
the prior period adjustments of ₱20,395,669.96  in the FSs, which amount was 
merely added with the CY 2020 beginning balance of Accumulated 
Surplus/(Deficit) account without any details, contrary to the IPSAS 3, 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and 
pertinent provisions of Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. Thus, the 
accuracy and validity of the Accumulated Surplus/(Deficit) account of TUP-S 
cannot be ascertained. 

 
8.1 Section 5, Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I requires the 

submission of complete set of financial statements composed of Statement 
of Financial Position (SFP), Statement of Financial Performance (SFPer), 
Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity (SCNA/E), Statement of Cash 
Flows (SCF), Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amount 
(SCBAA); and Notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory notes. 
 

8.2 Section 7 of the said Manual also states that the “Financial statements shall 
present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of 



67 
 

the entity.  Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the 
effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the 
definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue and 
expenses set out in PPSAS2.  The application of PPSAS with additional 
disclosures when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements 
that achieve a fair presentation (Par 27, PPSAS I)” 

 
8.3 Salient points from the International Public Sector Accounting Standard 

(IPSAS 3) include: 
 
• Paragraph 46 – “Errors arising in respect of the recognition, 

measurement, presentation or disclosure of elements of financial 
statements.  Financial statements do not comply with IPSASs if they 
contain either material errors or immaterial errors made intentionally to 
achieve a particular presentation of an entity’s financial position, 
financial performance or cash flows.  Potential current period errors 
discovered in that period are corrected before the financial statements 
are authorized for issue. However, material errors are sometimes not 
discovered until a subsequent period, and these prior period errors are 
corrected in the comparative information presented in the financial 
statements for the subsequent period.” 
 

• Paragraph 47 – “An entity shall correct material prior period errors 
retrospectively in the first set of financial statements authorized for issue 
after their discovery by: 
o restating the comparative amounts for prior period(s) presented in 

which the error occurred; or 
o if the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, 

restating the opening balances of assets, liabilities and net 
assets/equity for the earliest prior period presented” 

•  
• Paragraph 48 – “A prior period error shall be corrected by retrospective 

restatement except to the extent that it is impracticable to determine 
either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the error.” 

 
• Paragraph 54 – “In applying paragraph 47, an entity shall disclose the 

following: 
o the nature of the prior period error; 
o for each prior period presented, to the extent practicable, the 

amount of the correction for each financial statements line item 
affected; 

o the amount of the correction at the beginning of the earliest prior 
period presented; and

Guidance, pursuant to COA Resolution  No. 2020-001 dated January 9, 2020 



68 
 

o if retrospective restatement is impracticable for a particular prior 
period, the circumstances that led to the existence of that condition 
and a description of how and from when the error has been 
corrected.” 

 
8.4 Review of the TUP-S comparative Statements of Changes in Net 

Assets/Equity for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 
2020 disclosed an amount totaling ₱20,395,669.96, which pertains to the 
campuses’ adjustments to correct errors in CY 2020. It was noted that the 
Accounting Office did not apply the adjustments for these errors 
retrospectively. Hence, the amounts were not reflected in the prior years’ FS 
and in the CY 2020 beginning balances of the affected accounts. 
 

8.5 Further, the corresponding disclosures on these prior period adjustments 
merely state the transactions contributing to the said errors and does not 
clearly describe the nature of the errors as well as the effects of correcting 
them in the prior and current year FS. This is not in accordance with 
Paragraph 54 of the IPSAS 3 as well as with Section 45, Chapter 19 of the 
GAM for NGAs, Volume I, which provides an illustration of the proper 
procedures and disclosures in the retrospective restatement of errors. 
 

8.6 The inaccuracy of the balances presented in the FS of CY 2020 adversely 
affected its fair presentation as the figures did not faithfully represent the 
effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the 
definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, revenue and 
expenses set out in IPSASs (Par.27, IPSAS 1). 
 

8.7 Relatively, the objectives of government accounting as enumerated in  
Section 110 of PD No. 1445, which are to “(1) produce information 
concerning past operations and present conditions; (2) provide a basis for 
guidance for future operations; (3) provide for control of the acts of public 
bodies and officers in the receipt, disposition and utilization of funds and 
property; and (4) report on the financial position and the results of 
operations of government agencies for the information of all persons 
concerned.” can only be achieved by preparing a reliable and fairly 
presented FSs. 

 
8.8 We recommended that Management: 

 
a. analyze the components of the prior period adjustments to 

determine its nature and the affected accounts and reflect the 
changes  in the comparative FSs for CYs  2019 and 2020; 
 

b. provide the details of the prior period adjustments for presentation 
in the Notes to FSs; and 

 



69 
 

c. comply with paragraph 54 of the IPSAS 3 in the proper disclosure 
and presentation of the retrospective application/restatement of 
errors. 

 
 
Non-compliance with the Revised Chart of Accounts 
 
9. TUPM did not comply with the Revised Chart of Accounts in the presentation of 

accounts in the Trial Balances, FSs and Notes to the FSs as well as the use of 
account names and object codes as of December 31, 2020 as updated in CY 2019 
and prescribed under COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020, thus 
affecting the proper recognition and presentation of financial transactions in the 
books of accounts of the University. 

 
9.1 COA Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020 prescribes the Volume 

III – Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2019) replacing Volume III – The 
Revised Chart of Accounts (Updated 2015) of the Government Accounting 
Manual for National Government Agencies effective January 1, 2020 to 
facilitate proper recognition of financial transactions in the books of 
accounts and preclude misuse of accounts. 

 
9.2 Review of the submitted Trial Balances, FSs and Notes to FSs as of 

December 31, 2020 of TUPM revealed that the object code and account 
names of the following accounts did not conform with the Revised Chart of 
Accounts,  as updated:

9.3 The abovementioned accounts and their respective UACS codes should be 

used in the CY 2020 FS to facilitate the proper recording/recognition of 
financial transactions in the books of accounts of the University. 
 

9.4 We recommended that Management of TUPM use the Revised Chart of 
Accounts in the 2020 Financial Statements including the Notes to the 
Financial Statements as updated in 2019, prescribed under COA 
Circular No. 2020-001 dated January 8, 2020. 
 

9.5 Management of TUPM said that the implementation of the revision of Chart 
of Accounts in compliance with COA Circular No. 2020-001 through the 
Accounting Department is still ongoing. 

 
 
Inadequacy in the Disclosure in the Notes to FSs 
 
10. The accuracy and reliability of the amounts reported in the SCF and other 

affected accounts in the FSs of TUP-S could not be ascertained due to the non-
compliance of the Accounting Office in providing the following : a) explanation 
of the material differences between the budget and actual amounts;                    
b) reconciliation of Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities to 
Surplus/(Deficit); and c) adequate disclosures on the Notes to the FSs, contrary 
to pertinent provisions of Chapters 3 and 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I, 
thus affecting the fair presentation of the financial statements at yearend. 

 



71 
 

10.1 Pertinent provisions of Chapter 3 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I are as 
follows: 

 
• Section 26.c – “Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts.  

This shall be prepared based on the various registries maintained by the 
Budget Division/Unit such as the RRORs, RAPAL, RAOD/RBUD and 
other SDs.  The data on Actual Amounts shall be verified by the 
Accounting Division/Unit in the Statement of Cash Flows (SCF).  The 
statement shall present, by way of note disclosure, an explanation of the 
material differences between the budget and actual amounts, which are 
not included in the financial statements.” 
 

• Section 27 – “Changes from Original to Final Budget.  An entity shall 
present an explanation of whether the changes between the original and 
final budget are a consequence of reallocations within the budget by 
way of note disclosure in the FSs.” 

 
• Section 28 – “Reconciliation of Actual Amounts on a Comparable Basis 

(Budget) and Actual Amounts in the Financial Statements.  The actual 
amounts presented on a comparable basis to the budget shall be 
reconciled with the actual amounts presented in the FSs identifying 
separately the differences classified as follows: 
o Basis Differences, which occur when the approved budget is 

prepared on a basis other than the accounting basis; 
o Timing Differences, which occur when the budget period differs from 

the reporting period reflected in the FSs; and 
o Entity Differences, which occur when the budget omits program or 

entities that are part of the entity for which the FSs are prepared. 
 

The reconciliation shall be disclosed as part of the Notes to the FSs.”  
 

10.2 Sections 31c and 24,  Chapter 19 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I provide 
as follows: 
 
• Section 31c – “Structure of the Notes to Financial Statements.  The notes 

shall provide additional information that is not presented on the face of 
the Statement of Financial Position, Statement of Financial 
Performance, Statement of Changes in Net Assets/Equity, and Statement 
of Cash Flows, but that is relevant to an understanding of any of them.” 

 
• Section 24 – “xxx. Entities reporting cash flows from operating activities 

using the direct method shall provide a reconciliation of the 
surplus/deficit from ordinary activities with the net cash flow from 
operating activities. This reconciliation shall be provided in the notes to 
the financial statements.” 

 



72 
 

10.3 Review of the Notes to the FSs of TUP-S submitted to the Audit Team 
revealed that various information/explanation/disclosure requirements were 
not provided such as: 
 
• Explanation whether the changes between the original and final budget are 

a consequence of reallocations within the budget; 
• Reconciliation between the actual amounts on a comparable basis and 

actual amounts in the FSs;  
• Reconciliation of Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities to 

Surplus/Deficit; 
• Explanation of the material differences between the budget and actual 

amounts; and  
 

10.4 The inadequate disclosures in the Notes to the FSs affected the fair 
presentation of the FSs of the TUP-S at yearend. 
 

10.5 We recommended that Management provide the necessary information/ 
explanation/disclosure in the Notes to the FSs for CY 2020 as required 
in the abovementioned provisions of GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 

 
 
COMPLIANCE AUDIT 
 
Erroneous charging of Tuition Fees and Other School Fees 
 
11. Lapses were observed in the recording, billing and charging of various fees to 

CHED (UniFAST) in the implementation of Free Higher Education,  such as : 
a) erroneous charging to UniFAST of National Service Training Program 
(NSTP) Fees of  147 enrolled students amounting to ₱66,160.00and  tuition fees 
paid by 75 eligible students for additional subjects; b) exclusion in the billing 
statements of 57 undergraduate students who were still within the grace period 
of their respective programs, thus considered as paying students; c) 
unidentified paying students for the 1st semester of AY 2020-2021 due to 
inconsistency of  TUPM records; and d) unreturned excess charge of School ID 
Fees amounting to ₱508,400.00, contrary to RA No. 10931 or the “Universal 
Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act of 2017”. 

 
11.1 Section 2 of the RA No. 10931, the “Universal Access to Quality Tertiary 

Education Act of 2017” also known as the Free Higher Education Act, states 
that FHE was established to protect and promote the right of all Filipino 
students to accessible quality education in both private and public 
educational institutions. The paramount objective of the law is to give 
priority to students who are academically able but came from poor families. 

 



73 
 

11.2 Section 7 of the IRR of the same law enumerated the benefits that an 
eligible student is entitled to such as free tuition fee, free miscellaneous, 
other school fees, and similar or related fees. 
 

11.3 Below are the observations noted on the excessive/erroneous charging of 
various fees by the University: 
 
Table 20. Excessive/Erroneous charging of Tuition Fees and Other School Fees 

Campus Deficiencies Particulars 
TUPT Erroneous charging 

of ₱450.00 NSTP 
Fees to 147 students 
enrolled in ladderized 
degree programs for 
the 1st Term AY 
2020-2021 of TUPT 
amounting to 
₱66,160.00 

Section 3 of RA No. 10647, also known as the 
Ladderized Education Act of 2014, defines ladderized 
education as “the harmonization of all education and 
training mechanisms that allow students and workers to 
progress between technical-vocational and higher 
education programs, or vice-versa”.  
 
For the 1st term of AY 2020-2021, TUPT has 147 
enrolled students in three ladderized degree programs, 
namely: Bachelor of Engineering (BE), Bachelor of 
Technology in Information Technology (BTIT) and 
Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (BSME).  
Students who transferred to the ladderized programs of 
the University were issued new Student Numbers (SNs), 
the first two numbers indicate the year of entry of the 
students to the University program.  
 
During the preparation of the FHE billing statement 
pertaining to the said term, 147 students who have been 
previously enrolled in a three-year course in the 
University and who have already taken up their NSTP 
during their first year, were inadvertently identified as 
first year students and were erroneously charged with 
NSTP fees. Breakdown of the erroneous charges per 
program is as follows:

Students

BSME 47 450.00 21,150.00 

Total 66,150.00 
 

Tuition and other 
school fees already 
billed to UniFAST 
still charged to 
students eligible for 
Free Higher 
Education Program. 
 

A Certificate of Registration (COR) shows the students’ 
actual enrolled subjects, the equivalent units as well as 
the corresponding tuition fees and other school fees 
(TOSF) for a certain term. Verification of the COR and 
the related billing of eligible students showed the 
following:  
• 9 students still paid for their tuition fee totaling 

₱7,100.00 and 
•  8 students were charged in excess of the actual TOSF 

as presented in their COR amounting to ₱5,675.00.  
 
This resulted in the overpayment of TOSF by the student

and the UniFAST, hence subject for refund pursuant to 
Section 1.3.c5, Rule IV of the UniFAST Memorandum 
Circular No. 2018-02, which requires the SUCs to revert 
back any excess fund transfers. The details are as 
follows:

and 1st Term AY 
2020-2021 

Section 4 of RA No. 10931 provides that all Filipino 
students who are enrolled or shall enroll in any SUCs are 
eligible to FHE as long as they qualify for the admission 
and retention policy of the University.  Further, Section 
11 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA No. 
10931 enumerated the documents that are required by all 
SUCs and LUCs to be submitted to the CHED within 
five (5) working days after the last day of registration for 
each semester. 
 
TUP has opted to use the billing system as a method of 
disbursement, which means that TUP bills the UniFAST 
for the tuition and other school fees of actual qualified 
enrolled students in every term or semester. The said 
actual qualified enrolled students are identified at the end 
of the University’s enrollment schedule and specified 
period for adding subjects. Billing statements then are 
meant to be accomplished at the end of the University’s 
enrollment period and such period includes the days 
extended for adding and dropping of subjects to finalize 
the class list as well as the final number of enrollees. 
 
However, it was observed that the intended duration of 
enrollment, as contained in the academic calendar, was 
not strictly implemented as adding of subjects and 
approval of special classes were allowed for as long as it 
is within the term. This instance does not clearly 
establish the last day of enrollment or registration for the 
term, hence allowed charging of tuition fees to eligible 
students when they enroll for additional subjects after the 
submission of TUPT’s billing statement to TUPM for 
consolidation. The charging of fees to eligible students 
defeated the primary purpose of the FHE Act which is to 
provide free higher education to all qualified Filipino 
students. Details are as follows: 
 

Period No. of Students 

Paid/Charged  
Tuition Fees 

(In PhP) 
2nd Term AY 2019-2020 17 16,825.00

Exclusion of 57 
undergraduate 
students who were 
still within the grace 
period of their 
respective programs 
in the Free Higher 
Education billing 
statements for the 1st 
Term of AY 2020-
2021 

A grace period of one (1) year after the prescribed period 
or maximum residency of the student’s program is given 
to allow a student to still avail of the FHE. Review of the 
paying students’ profile showed that 57 of them are still 
within the grace period, hence should have been included 
in the billings for FHE. 
 
Furthermore, based on the Certification by the Registrar, 
out of the 3,599 enrolled students in the 1st Term of AY 
2020-2021,  3,542 are qualified for free tuition and other 
school fees, hence a difference of 57 were considered 
paying students.  
 
However, the certification did not tally with the list of 
paying students submitted by the same Office showing a 
total of 69 students or a difference of 10 students. This 
circumstance raised difficulty in ascertaining whether 
controls are sufficient in the checking of eligibility 
requirements and monitoring of paying students. 

TUPM Unidentified paying 
students for the 1st 
semester of AY 
2020-2021 

Based on the Certification issued by the Registrar, out of 
the 15,670 enrolled students in the 1st semester of AY 
2020-2021, 15,645 students are qualified for free tuition 
and other school fees, hence a residual of five (5) 
students were considered paying students. The same 
office, however, claimed that only one (1) student was 
not qualified for FHE, hence an inconsistency in their 
records. 

Unreturned excess 
charge of School ID 
Fees amounting to 
₱508,400.00 

Section 1.4 (d6), Rule II of the MOA requires TUP to 
revert back to CHED any excess fund transfer.  
 
It was noted in CY 2019 that there was no renewal of IDs 
for the 1st semester of AY 2019-2020.  However, audit of 
the billing statement No. NCR-TUP-2019-1-1, revealed 
that the TUP charged a total amount of ₱1,299,300.00 
(12,993 x ₱100.00) school ID fees for all the 12,993 
qualified enrollees of TUP Manila for the 1st semester 
when there are only 7,909 first year students enrolled and 
should have charged a total amount of ₱790,900.00 only, 
thus an excess of ₱508,400.00. 
 
However, to date, TUPM has not returned the excess 
charge of School ID fees amounting to ₱508,400.00, 
despite already receiving the funds for the 1st semester of 
AY 2019-2020. 

 
11.4 We recommended that Management: 

 
Campus Recommendations 
TUPT a. ensure that proper controls are in place in the implementation of the FHE in 

order to prevent errors and misrepresentations; 
 

b. strictly follow the schedule of enrollment and the specified period of adding 
subjects, as integrated in the academic calendar of the University, to allow a 



76 
 

Campus Recommendations 
better organization of student database and avoid charging of additional fees 
to eligible students; 
 

c. revert/return to UniFAST the NSTP Fees of ₱66,160.00 and the excess charges 
of ₱4,025.00 upon receipt of the 1st Term AY 2020-2021 payment and make the 
necessary adjusting entry to correct the affected accounts; 

 
d. immediately refund the paid tuition fees to the 57 eligible students totaling 

₱7,100.00 and the excess charges to UniFAST amounting to ₱1,650.00; and 
 

e. require the Registrar’s Office to maintain records that classify eligible and 
paying students to support their Certification and will guide them in the 
preparation of FHE billing statements. 

TUPM f. thru the Registrar’s Office, maintain records that classify eligible and paying 
students to support their Certification and as their guide in the preparation of 
FHE billing statements; and 
 

g. revert to CHED the excess charge of School ID Fees amounting to 
₱508,400.00. 

 
11.5 The Management commented, thus: 

 
Campus Comment 
TUPM The Management said that it will comply and meet with concerned officials and staff 

to address the concerns. 
TUPT • For the erroneous charging of ₱450.00 NSTP Fees to 147 students enrolled in 

ladderized degree programs for the 1st term AY 2020-2021 totaling ₱66,160.00, there 
was an error in the preparation of the billing statement, the Registrar generated the 
data from the Enrollment Registration System (ERS) and was not able to delete those 
ladderized students, thus included in the UniFAST billing.  However, the excess 
charges of ₱66,160.00 and ₱4,025.00 related to NSTP Fees will be reverted to 
UniFAST thru TUPM upon receipt of the 1st term AY 2020-2021 payment and 
reflect adjusting entries of the affected accounts. 
 

• With regards to the payment of tuition fees by 75 eligible students for additional 
subjects enrolled in 2nd term AY 2019-2020, 3rd term AY 2019-2020 and 1st term AY 
2020-2021, TUPT will strictly follow the schedule of enrollment and the specified 
period of adding subjects as integrated in the academic calendar of the University. 
The Registrar together with the Assistant Director for the Academic Affairs will 
review the enrollment policy and guidelines to ensure that the schedule and duration 
of enrollment will be properly implemented, and students will be guided accordingly. 

 
• Relative to the excessive charging of TOSF already billed to UniFAST and paid by 

eligible students, the Registrar will review the COR of the students if they are still 
qualified for the FHE and if found eligible, TUPT will refund the paid school fees to 
the students. 

 
• As regards the exclusion of 57 undergraduate students who were still within the 

grace period of their respective programs in the FHE billing statements for the 1st 
term AY 2020-2021, the Registrar will trace back the records of 57 paying students 
if eligible for the FHE, as well as the issued Certification in order to clarify the status 
of students and will maintain records that classify eligible and paying students to 
support the certification and the billing statements of FHE.

Special Trust Fund (STF) Management 
 
12. Deficiencies in the management/administration of the STF were noted such 

as: a) non-compliance with CHED Memorandum No 20, s. 2011 as shown by 
i) absence of details on the provision for Common Fund amounting to 
₱20,000,000.00,  ii) non-observance of the prescribed allocation of tuition fees 
that resulted in excess allocation of ₱28,309,300.00, iii) improper utilization of 
Curriculum Development allocation for honoraria to pay the salaries totaling 
P7,102,905.33 of part-time faculty professors without duly approved 
contracts; and iv) unutilized Capital Outlay Budget for Current and 
Continuing STF in the total amount of ₱291,778,865.99, thus affecting the 
delivery of services for the modernization, improvement, and upgrading of 
equipment and facilities; b) non-adherence to the policy on realignments on 
Current and Continuing STF pursuant to BOR Resolution No. 29, s. 2014; 
and c) payment of Personnel Assistance and Welfare Fund amounting to 
₱300,000.00, contrary to Section 4(d) of RA No. 8292. 
 

12.1 Paragraph 4, Section 4(d) of RA No. 8292 or the Higher Education 
Modernization Act of 1997 provides that “any income generated by the 
University or college from tuition fees and other charges, as well as from 
the operation of auxiliary services and land grants, shall be retained by 
the university or college, and may be disbursed by the Board of Regents 
(BOR) for instruction, research, extension, or other programs/projects of 
the university or college: Provided, that all fiduciary fees shall be 
disbursed for the specific purposes for which they are collected.” 
 

12.2 Section 31, Chapter 3 of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I on the 
Preparation of the Budget Reports provides for the SABUDBOE (FAR 
No. 2-A).  “This report shall reflect the details of the approved budget, 
utilizations, disbursements and balance of the entity’s income authorized 
by law to use presented by object of expenditures consistent with COA 
Revised Chart of Accounts and shall be prepared by Funding Source 
Code as clustered.” 

  
12.3 Section 24 of CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 20, s. 2011, on 

Implementation of the Budget provides that the budget authorized by the 
BOR shall be implemented within the Calendar Year for which it was 
formulated.  The inclusive collection period and the Quarter for which 
the collection will be used shall be clearly and specifically stated. 
(Underscoring supplied)

12.5 Audit of the STF in the following Campuses disclosed the following 

observations, viz: 
 
a. Non-compliance with CHED Memorandum No. 20, s. 2011 

 
i. Absence of details on the provision for Common Fund amounting to 

₱20,000,000.00 
 

12.6 Section 18 of CMO No. 20, s.2011 states that SUC shall provide for a 
common fund out of which the expenditures considered as SUC-wide 
common administrative costs shall be paid.  It also states that each campus 
or SUC shall allocate a portion of their budget to defray college-wide 
administrative and development costs, which consist  of, but not limited to, 
the following: 
 

• Costs in the holding of BOR/T meeting 
• Travel expenses of the BOR/T members 
• Honoraria and other incentives of the BOR/T 
• General administrative support services 
• Honoraria of the Vice President (VP) for Administration, VP for 

Academic Affairs, Student Services Directors, Research & 
Development Services, and Extension & External Services Directors, 

• MOOE of College-wide Officials and staff (Chief Administrative 
Officers, Budget Officer, Accountant, Human Resource Officer, 
Management and Audit Analyst, Supply and Property Officer, and 
other college-wide officers) 

• Other SUC-wide services and activities (non-recurring, e.g., 
thanksgiving at year-end, equipment outlay – payroll/salary and 
HRM services; four campuses-disbursement/payment services-
Cashier’s office equipment, year-end incentives and the like). 

• Establishment of fund for SUC-wide faculty development fund and 
for any specific committee that may be established for a specific 
purpose. 

 
12.7 The Non-Fiduciary Fund available for utilization for CY 2020 of TUPT 

amounted to ₱57,573,000.00, which consisted of projected income from 
tuition fees of ₱41,394,000.00, and estimated income from other school fees 



79 
 

and other service income with an aggregate amount of ₱11,179,000.00.   
Based on the submitted budgetary allocation by the Budget Office, it was 
noted that the specific allocations was applied after deducting first the 
provision for common fund of ₱20,000,000.00 to the projected tuition fee, 
with a balance of ₱21,394,000.00.  It was further noted, however, that no 
details were provided as to the composition of the provision for Common 
Fund, as shown below:

ii. Non-observance of the prescribed allocation of tuition fees as 
provided in Section 6 of CHED Memorandum Order No. 20, s. 2011 
resulted in excess allocation of ₱28,309,300.00 

 
12.8 Section 6 of CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 20, s. 2011 provides 

that the primary function of the SUC is instruction and shall be allocated a 
total of fifty percent (50%) of the actual tuition fees collected within the 
current calendar year. 



80 
 

12.9 The following are the related components of budget allocation for 
Instruction: 
 
• “Faculty and Staff Development (FSD) – (12.50 percent of the tuition fees) 

budget allocation shall be used for overload pay (faculty member with 
permanent status), trainings and seminars, scholarship grants, 
educational tours (assistance), in-house training and evaluation, and 
other similar activities for the enhancement of the capabilities of the 
faculty members. x x x” (Underscoring supplied) 

 
• “Curriculum Development (CD) – (12.50 percent of the tuition fees) 

budget allocation shall be used for honoraria of part time faculty 
members (with duly approved contract of employment), subscription to 
journals (trade journals), books, reviewers, reproduction of 
instructional materials, shop tools and other instructional equipment,  
educational field trip assistance, industry immersion, seminar 
workshops and curriculum review and development, and such other 
maintenance and operating expenses as may be deemed directly and 
indirectly related and necessary to accomplish delivery of curricular 
requirements.” (Underscoring supplied) 

 
12.10 The budget allocated by TUPM for FSD amounted to ₱38,989,000.00. Out 

of the total, ₱35,969,000.00 is for Personnel Services (PS) which solely 
comprises honoraria for the payment of teaching overload, which will 
augment the allotment in General Fund (Fund 101) amounting to 
₱21,507,000.00. However, verification disclosed that the approved budget 
for the honoraria has exceeded the budgetary allocation for FSD as 
prescribed in Section 6 of CHED CMO No. 20 by ₱28,259,300.00 based on 
the projected tuition fees for CY 2020, as shown below: 

 
Table 23. Approved Honoraria Budget Excess Over FSD Budgetary Allocation 

Budgetary allocation for FSD     
Projected Tuition Fees for CY 2020 ₱123,355,200.00    
Percentage allocation (50% x 12.50%) 6.25% ₱7,709,700.00  

Amount allocated for honoraria (teaching 
overload)  35,969,000.00  

Allocation in excess of the prescribed limit (₱28,259,300.00) 
      

 
12.11 Moreover, on the basis of actual collection of tuition fees in CY 2020 

totaling ₱115,010,598.59 as taken from the Quarterly Report of Revenue 
and Other Receipts (FAR No. 5) as of December 31, 2020, the prescribed 
allocation for FSD only amounted to ₱7,188,162.41. In contrast, the actual 
disbursement incurred for honoraria (teaching overload) as presented in 
FAR No. 2 as at yearend amounted to ₱36,439,021.38 or an excess of 
₱29,250,858.97. Details are presented in Table 24: 

 



81

36,439,021.38  

Disbursements in excess of the prescribed limit ₱(29,250,858.97) 
      

 
12.12 Further, it can be gathered from the aforestated information that the amount 

of disbursements incurred exceeded the allocated budget for honoraria 
(teaching overload) by ₱470,021.38 (₱36,439,021.38 less ₱35,969,000.00). 
Although it was resolved through augmentation of funds amounting to 
₱645,592.97 as a result of the approval of the supplemental budget by the 
BOR per Resolution No. 2, s. 2020, it still connotes that there are some 
issues as to the assignment of teaching loads, necessity of hiring of regular 
faculty for the unfilled positions of professors and other factors affecting the 
programs being offered by TUPM vis-à-vis budgetary constraints and 
prescribed allocation of fund. 
 
iii. Utilization of Curriculum Development allocation  for honoraria to 

pay the salaries totalling ₱7,102,905.33 of part-time faculty 
professors without duly approved contracts   

 
12.13 On the other hand, Curriculum Development allocation shall be used for 

honoraria of part-time faculty members with duly approved contract of 
employment. In relation thereto, there was a complaint on the delay of part-
time professors’ (PTPs) salary filed before this Commission thru the 
Citizens’ Desk Reporting System on January 4, 2021. In response thereto, 
verification of pertinent documents was made. It was revealed then that the 
total payment of teaching overload already made to PTPs for SY 2020-2021 
amounted to ₱7,102,905.33 as at yearend. Further, it was noted that 56 PTPs 
have already rendered services in the absence of a perfected contracts, and 
40 of which have been paid salaries without approved contracts. Thus, this 
is contrary to the provision of the aforesaid CMO. Details are presented in 
the table below:

iv. Unutilized  Capital Outlay Budget for Current and Continuing STF 
totaling ₱291,778,865.99 

 
12.14 The aggregate budget available for the Capital Outlay for CY 2020 of 

TUPM and TUPT campuses amounted to ₱419,847,491.75, which consists 
of Current STF (CY 2020) and Continuing STF (CY 2019) amounting to 
₱271,038,791.00 and ₱148,808,700.75, respectively. Verification of the 
utilization of the Current STF as reported in the SABUBDBOE disclosed 
that the budget used only amounted to ₱54,465,368.45 or 20.10 percent, 
leaving an unutilized amount of ₱216,573,422.55 or 79.90 percent, as shown 
in Table 26:

12.15 While still almost only half was utilized during the year from the remaining 
balance of the Continuing STF wherein the budget used was only 
₱73,603,257.31 or 49.46 percent, which resulted in unutilized amount of 
₱75,205,443.44 or 50.54 percent, as presented in Table 27:

12.16 The budgetary authority of the said unused portion has already became 

expired, thus it will be needed to undergo another process and series of 
planning, programming, deliberation, and eventually approval by the BOR 
in order to use again the fund, which take time. 

 
12.17 These aforestated results suggest that there are needed improvements on the 

planning and procurement process in order to at least minimize the hurdles, 
inefficiencies and the impact of the ongoing pandemic due to COVID-19 in 
the expeditious implementation of the projects and the delivery of much 
needed development and upgrading of facilities and equipment especially 
that the conduct of classes have shifted to online as the face-to-face classes 
are still prohibited, hence strengthening the facilities on internet 
connectivity and online platform are necessary. 
 



83 
 

b. Non-adherence to the policy on realignments on Current and 
Continuing STF pursuant to BOR Resolution No. 29, s. 2014 

 
12.18 BOR Resolution No. 29, s.2014, which was approved by the BOR on its 3rd 

Quarter Regular BOR Meeting held on October 7, 2014 and duly 
promulgated with the issuance of Implementing Order No. 29, s. 2014 dated 
October 10, 2014, provides that realignment of savings “from” and “to” 
specific projects, among others, should not exceed 25 percent of the original 
approved amount. 
 

12.19 Verification of the SABUDBOE of TUPT as of December 31, 2020 showed  
that the realignment made from Security Expenses to Janitorial Expenses 
with an aggregate amount of ₱822,043.35 exceeded the 25 percent limit as 
provided in the aforesaid provision ranging from 37.50 – 43.26 percent, as 
shown in Table 28:

c. Payment of Personnel Assistance and Welfare Fund amounting to 

₱300,000.00, contrary to Section 4(d) of RA No. 8292 
 

12.20 Paragraph 3, Section 4(d) of RA No. 8292, or An Act for the Uniform 
Composition and Powers of the Governing Boards, the Manner of 
Appointment and Term of Office of the President of Chartered State 
Universities and Colleges, and for Other Purposes, states in part: 
 
“Powers and duties of Governing Boards. – x x x 
 x x x 

 

Any provision of existing laws, rules, and regulations to the contrary 
notwithstanding, any income generated by the university or college from 
tuition fees and other charges, as well as from the operation of auxiliary 
services and land grants, shall be retained by the university or college, and 



84 
 

may be disbursed by the Board of Regents/Trustees for instruction, 
research, extension, or other programs/projects of the university or college. 
x x x” (Underscoring supplied) 
 

12.21 Audit showed that the amount of ₱300,000.00 from the STF was transferred 
to TUPV Personnel Assistance Welfare Fund (PAWF) for medical 
assistance. The said amount was charged and accounted in the books as 
Other Personnel Benefits. 
 
However, the Supreme Court in the case of Rotoras vs. COA, G.R. No. 
211999, August 20, 2019, explained: “Section 4(d) limits the use of the 
special trust fund for instruction, research, or extension. The ‘other 
programs/projects’ referred to in Section 4(d) must be of the same nature as 
instruction, research, or extension.” 
 

12.22 In that case, the Court cited the case of Benguet State University v. 
Commission on Audit, 551 Phil. 878, 886-887 (2007), which upheld the 
Commission on Audit's disallowance of rice subsidy and healthcare 
allowance granted to the employees of petitioner Benguet State University, 
ruling that the phrase "other programs/projects" does not encompass all 
projects and programs of the university. The court explained: 
 

“Under the principle of ejusdem generis, where a statute describes 
things of a particular class or kind accompanied by words of a 
generic character, the generic word will usually be limited to 
things of a similar nature with those particularly enumerated, 
unless there be something in the context of the statute which would 
repel such inference. The COA correctly ruled that the ‘other 
programs/projects’ under R.A. No. 8292 and its Implementing 
Rules should be of the same nature as instruction, research, and 
extension. In BSU's case, the disbursements were for rice subsidy 
and health care allowances which are, in no way, intended for 
academic programs similar to instruction, research, or extension. 
Section 4 (d) cannot, therefore, be relied upon by BSU as the legal 
basis for the grant of the allowances.” 

 
12.23 Similarly, the Audit Team is of the same premise that the STF of TUPV 

cannot be used to fund its medical assistance program, as it is not intended 
for academic programs similar to  instruction, research or extension. 
 

12.24 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. provide details for the allocated common fund amounting to 
₱20,000,000.00 to specific budgetary allocation for thrust/program/ 
activity provided in Sections 6 to 17 of CMO No. 20, s. 2011, if there 
is any; 



85 
 

b. adhere to the prescribed allocations in the utilization of Tuition Fees 
as provided in Section 6 of CMO No. 20, s. 2011; 

 
c. assess/revisit the University’s policy on the assignment/granting of 

teaching loads to regulate/limit the disbursements of honoraria for 
overload that are aligned within the prescribed allocation set forth 
in CMO No. 20, s. 2011; 

 
d. provide justification on the low utilization of budget allocated to 

Capital Outlay and submit status of implementation of the 
infrastructure projects identified under the Current and Continuing 
STF; 

 
e. enhance the procurement planning by considering the effect of the 

pandemic and the pertinent guidelines issued by concerned 
government agencies vis-à-vis procurement timelines to formulate a 
well-defined work in order to achieve the timely and full 
implementation of the targeted programs, projects and activities;  

 
f. adhere to the provisions on realignment in accordance with BOR 

Resolution No. 29, s. 2014 dated October 7, 2014; and 
 

g. provide legal basis for the use of STF (Fund 164) for other personnel 
benefits particularly for medical assistance, otherwise, the same will 
be disallowed in audit. 

 
12.25 The Management commented, thus: 

 
Campus Comment 
TUPV The Personnel Assistance and Welfare Fund (PAWF) is a fund adopted by the 

University pursuant to Civil Service Commission (CSC) Resolution No. 97-4684 dated 
December 18, 1997, DBM Circular Letter No. 95-4 dated August 1995, RA No. 8292 
and the pertinent resolutions of the Board of Regents of the University. 
 
The Management further explained that the provision of its yearly augmentation in the 
STF (Fund 164) is in compliance with the Collective Negotiation Agreement entered 
by the University with faculty members in the TUP System and with TUP-Taguig 
Employees Association, the exclusive representative of all rank and file employees of 
the TUP System. It is provided in Article XII Health Maintenance Scheme: 

Section 8. The University shall endeavor to regularly increase the medical 
check-fee granted to the faculty. 
 
Section 10. The University shall adopt a free health maintenance program 
to all employees of the University. 

 
12.26 Auditor’s Rejoinder 

 
The Audit Team is not questioning the legality of the creation of the PAWF. 
However, the audit finding is being upheld since STF should not be used to 



86 
 

fund the same as Section 4(d) of RA No. 8292 limits the use of the STF 
exclusively for instruction, research, or extension that is anchored from the 
aforesaid Supreme Court decision, which is clear that the use of STF does not 
extend to healthcare allowances. 
 
 

Delayed Implementation of University Student Center Building 
 
13. Delayed action of Management of TUPM to impose the necessary remedies 

against the Contractor for the non-completion of the ₱9,498,568.56 
Construction of the Four-Storey University Student Center Building,  covered 
by a Contract Agreement dated August 12, 2017, put to risk the interest of the 
government as it did not ensure the judicious use of funds, thereby exposing 
the University to increased project costs and also denied the TUP community 
of the use of the proposed facility.  

 
13.1 Section 68 of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184 or the Government 

Procurement Reform Act requires “all contracts executed in accordance 
with this Act and this IRR shall contain a provision on liquidated damages 
which shall be payable by the contractor in case of breach thereof. For the 
procurement of goods, infrastructure projects, and consulting services, the 
amount of the liquidated damages shall be at least equal to one-tenth of one 
percent (0.001) of the cost of the unperformed portion for every day of 
delay.  Once the cumulative amount of liquidated damages reaches ten 
percent (10%) of the amount of the contract, the procuring entity shall 
rescind the contract, without prejudice to other courses of action and 
remedies open to it.” 
 

13.2 Section 69 of the same IRR provides that in addition to the provision of 
Rules XXI and XXII, the Head of the Procuring Entity (HOPE) subject to 
the authority delegated to the BAC, if any,  shall impose on bidders or 
prospective bidders, the  administrative penalty of suspension for one (1) 
year for the first offense and two (2) years for the second offense from 
participating in competitive bidding process, as well as disqualification from 
further participating in  competitive bidding undertaken by the Procuring 
Entity concerned, including the forfeiture of the performance security posted 
by the concerned bidder and suspension or blacklisting of the supplier in 
accordance with the guidelines of the Government Procurement Policy 
Board (GPPB) 

 
13.3 Section II, No. 16 – Instruction to Bidders on Termination for Default of 

Contractor, also clarifies the right of the PE to terminate the contract in case 
of default of the Contractor while the project is ongoing, or when the project 
incurred a negative slippage of 15 percent or more regardless of whether or 
not previous warnings and notices have been issued for the contractor to 
improve his performance.

13.4 The proposed Four-Storey University Student Center Building with Roof 
Deck will be built on a 580 square meter lot adjacent to the existing 
basketball court frontage of the University Library with the conceptual 
design directed to address the needs of the TUP students.   It was envisioned 
to transform the University to a new kind of campus – one that is sustainable 
to provide education and discovery to students, visitors and TUP community 
who will be enjoying various features and interior spaces for community 
functions and student gatherings, meetings, conferences, academic coaching 
rooms while providing convenient access and pathways to vehicles and 
pedestrians at the same time.  The building will allow the TUPM to integrate 
its mission to provide a Student Centre that will house the Offices of the 
University Student Government (USG) and the Artisan and the TUP 
Canteen. 

 
13.5 The Contract Agreement dated August 12, 2017 entered into by and 

between the TUPM and the contractor states, among others, the following 
provisions enumerated below: 

 
• The Contractor shall coordinate with the TUP Project Management 

Committee (PMC) and shall complete and accomplish the project within 
320 calendar days from the acceptance of the Notice to Proceed (NTP) 
and in strict compliance with the approved construction plans, scope of 
works and technical specifications as indicated in the bid documents; 
 

• For and in consideration of the payments to be made by the TUP to the 
CONTRACTOR, as herein mentioned, the CONTRACTOR hereby 
agrees to perform and complete the WORKS and remedy any defects 
therein in conformity with and in all aspects with the provisions of the 
Contract; 

 
• In case the CONTRACTOR refuses or fails to satisfactorily complete 

the work within the specific period, including any extension of time duly 
granted, if any, it shall be considered in default under this Contract, and 
the CONTRACTOR shall pay TUP, without need of any demand 
whatsoever, liquidated damages, which shall not be considered as 
penalty, an amount to be determined for each calendar day of delay, 
until the work is completed and accepted or taken over by TUP; 
(Underscoring supplied) 

 
• In case the CONTRACTOR lags behind the agreed schedule of its work 

and incurs 15 percent or more negative slippage, based on the approved 
PERT/CPM, the Head of Procuring Entity of the TUP may, at his 
discretion, terminate or rescind the Contract pursuant to existing laws, 
rules and regulations. 

 



88 
 

13.6 Section V. Special Conditions of the Contract provides that the contract 
shall be reckoned from the Start Date and not from the contract effectivity 
date; the start date is seven days after the receipt of the NTP which was 
dated August 14, 2017 and received by the Contractor on September 4, 
2017. 
 
Review of pertinent documents disclosed the following: 

 
• A Certificate of Funds Availability in the amount of ₱9,498,568.56 was 

provided for the “Construction of Four-Storey University Student Center 
Building with Roof Deck” chargeable against Fund 164, CY 2015. The 
budgetary allocation had lapsed and a new budget had been requested 
and approved for the construction. 
 

• The project was awarded to Blackram Builders, Incorporated with a total 
contract price of ₱9,498,568.56 after a competitive public bidding 
conducted on May 24, 2017.  A Notice of Award dated July 14, 2017 
was issued, duly received by the Contractor on August 1, 2017. 

 
• A Performance Security in the form of Performance Bond (Surety Bond 

– G13-1-01629) callable on demand in the amount of ₱2,849,570.57 was 
posted by the Contractor accordingly to guarantee faithful performance 
of the obligation. 

 
• Payment of 15 percent mobilization fee amounting to ₱1,424,785.28 was 

made to the Contractor as recommended and approved by the PMC and 
the Vice President for Administration and Finance and the TUP 
President, respectively, under Check No. 0001015148 dated November 
22, 2017. 

 
13.7 Verification of the project implementation showed the following: 

 
• The construction of the Student Center should start on September 11, 

2017 and with a completion date of 320 days reckoned from the start 
date (seven days from the receipt of the NTP) and should be completed 
by July 28, 2018.  However, the status of the project only showed 19.71 
percent accomplishment rate per Enhanced Consolidated Quarterly 
Report on the Publicized Government Projects/Programs and Activities 
(GPPAs) as of December 31, 2018 submitted by the PMC. 
 
As reported, only the first and second concrete pouring of the foundation 
and tie beams were accomplished incurring negative slippages of 21.20 
percent as of March 12, 2018 (the latest update prepared by 
Management). Visibly, the deliverables which should have been 
accomplished within the timeline set per Technical Specifications 
Program of Work were not done. 



89 
 

• The abandoned project, with a reported accomplishment rate of 19.71 
percent as of December 31, 2018, incurred negative slippages of more 
than 15 percent, hence subject to: a) liquidated damages of 
approximately ₱4,540,315.08 as of November 18, 2019, the termination 
date of the contract; b) forfeiture of the Performance Bond amounting to 
₱2,849,570.57; and c) disqualification and/or blacklisting of the 
Contractor pursuant to Sections 68 and 69 of the Revised Implementing 
Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA No. 9184. 

 
• Despite the substantial delay/non-completion of the project which had 

already incurred negative slippages of more than 15 percent, the TUPM 
took no action to impose the liquidated damages which is already more 
than 10 percent of the contracted amount, contrary to Sections 68 and 69 
of the Revised IRR of RA No. 9184. 

 
The liquidated damages were computed approximately, as presented in

• On February 13, 2018, the Contractor requested for payment of the first 
progress billing amounting to ₱3,094,085.15, representing 28.06 percent 
work accomplishments for the period September 15 to February 7, 2018, 
which was refuted by the PMC insisting that the actual accomplishment 
is only 15.09 percent for the period stated.  It also instructed the 
Contractor to replace the concrete foundation of the project which is said 
to be only averaging to 3,097 pounds per square inch (psi) and not 
complying with the comprehensive strength of 4,000 psi as required. 
 

• On March 19, 2018 the construction was temporarily suspended pending 
result of the laboratory testing of the strength of concrete. While on July 
2, 2018, the President/PMC instructed the contractor to execute rebound 
hammer testing which was not executed. Thereafter, in the letter 
addressed to then TUPM OIC-President dated September 10, 2018, the 
Contractor insisted that the hammer test is not conclusive and 



90 
 

recommended the coring test instead as a sufficient method to evaluate 
the strength of concrete.  It also demanded that the TUPM pay their 
pending bills or they will terminate the construction contract. 

 
• Due to the continued defiance of the Contractor to perform his 

obligations despite written notice, the President, TUP issued 
Implementing Order No. 45 s. 2019 dated November 18, 2019 approving 
the request for the termination of contract with Blackram Builders, 
Incorporated and filing for the blacklisting of the said contractor with the 
Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB). Relatively, the Notice 
of Termination was served by the TUP President to the CEO/President, 
Blackram Builders in a letter dated December 9, 2019, which was 
acknowledged by the latter through a Counsel with a Motion for 
Extension to File Verified Position Paper dated December 26, 2019 and 
a letter-response dated January 16, 2020 to the Notice of Termination 
dated December 9, 2019. 

 
13.8 The Audit Team conducted an ocular inspection on the building site and 

noted no development in the area except for the incomplete foundation and 
beams which have been there since CY 2018.  The construction area was 
cleared of the wooden posts that served as a perimeter fence that once 
secured the unfinished structure, and judging from the site it can be 
construed that the construction was abandoned by the Contractor for a long 
time. 
 

13.9 This is a reiteration of prior year’s observation already been raised by the 
Audit Team to the Management of TUPM. The non-completion of the 
project put to risk the interest of the government as it failed to ensure the 
judicious use of funds and resources and exposed the University to increased 
project cost.  The significant escalation in the cost of construction materials 
and manpower could blow up the budget for the project originally costing 
only ₱9,498,568.56 (CY 2015).  The TUPM does not have enough buildings 
to accommodate offices, lectures and gatherings and its completion could 
have provided comfort to the intended beneficiaries by then.  The Audit 
Team was informed that a CY 2020 budget from the Development Fee 
(Fund 164) had been requested and approved for ₱16,000,000.00  to boost 
its completion but the construction is still uncertain considering the present 
issues and the bidding procedures which have not started yet. 

 
13.10 The Contract Agreement for the construction of the Student Center 

specifically enumerated the commitment of the Contractor to undertake the 
project strictly in accordance with the approved plans, scope of work and 
technical specifications and provisions of RA No. 9184 and its IRR and 
other pertinent laws, rules and regulations, therefore the Contractor is bound 
under the law to perform faithfully his obligations. 

 



91 
 

13.11 Notwithstanding the termination of the contract, Blackram Builders, 
Incorporated should be required to pay the liquidated damages for its non-
compliance with the conditions stipulated thereon and other administrative 
actions as necessary. 

 
13.12 We recommended that Management: 

 
a. institute the necessary remedies pursuant to Sections 68 and 69 of 

the IRR of RA No. 9184, as follows: 
• impose the payment of liquidated damages computed 

approximately at ₱4,540,315.08 on the contractor; 
• forfeit the Performance Bond amounting to ₱2,849,570.57; 
• pursue the disqualification and/or blacklisting of the Contractor 

for failure to faithfully comply with his obligation; and 
 

b. fast-track the immediate completion of the project for the benefit of 
the students, faculty, employees and other stakeholders to improve 
the quality of student life envisioned by the University. 
 

13.13 The Management commented, thus: 
 

Campus Comments 
TUPM • The project termination as approved by the TUP BOR was already executed. 

The Notice of Termination was sent to and received by the Contractor. 
 

• As to imposing liquidated damages, this remains under review since the 
previous PMC of the said project disputed the finding on liquidated 
damages. 

 
• The recommendation to forfeit performance bond no longer feasible as the 

said bond already expired. 
 

• The recommendation to disqualify and blacklist the Contractor is under legal 
review. 

 
• The TUPM Management shall proceed with the implementation of the 

project with an allocated budget of ₱30 million due to additional scope of 
work and is now ready for public bidding. 

 
 
Delayed Submission of Financial Reports/Documents and Supporting Schedules 
 
14. Despite the grace period given due to the Enhanced Community Quarantine 

Lockdowns, the TUPM incurred delays in the submission of Disbursement 
Vouchers (DVs) , financial reports/statements, including their supporting 
schedules, other required reports and documents ranging from two to 188 days 
while 47 DVs amounting to ₱7,894,388.47 were not yet submitted by TUPV, 
contrary to Section 122 of Presidential Decree No. 1445, Section 60, Chapter 
19, Volume I of the GAM for NGAs and Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of COA Circular 



92 
 

No. 2009-006, thus affecting the timely audit/verification of financial 
transactions and the correction of errors/deficiencies that may be found in the 
course of the audit, if any. 

 
14.1 Section 7.1.1 (a) of the Revised Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of 

Accounts (RRSA), as prescribed under COA Circular No. 2009-006 dated 
September 15, 2009 provides that “the head of the agency, who is primarily 
responsible for all government funds and property pertaining to his agency, 
shall ensure that the required financial and other reports and statements are 
submitted by the concerned agency officials in such form and within the 
period prescribed by the Commission.” 
 

14.2 Section 122 of PD No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing 
Code of the Philippines, provides the following: 
 
Paragraph 1 - “Submission of Reports. Whenever deemed necessary in the 
exigencies of the service, the Commission may under regulations issued by it 
require the agency heads, chief accountants, budget officers, cashiers, 
disbursing officers, administrative or personnel officers, and other 
responsible officials of the various agencies to submit trial balances, 
physical inventory reports, current plantilla of personnel, and such other 
reports as may be necessary for the exercise of its functions.” 
 
Paragraph 2 - “(2) Failure on the part of the officials concerned to submit 
the documents and reports mentioned herein shall automatically cause the 
suspension of payment of their salaries until they shall have complied with 
the requirements of the Commission.” 
 
Paragraph 3 - “No appropriation authorized in the General Appropriations 
Act shall be available to pay the salary or any official or employee who 
violates the provisions of this section, without prejudice to any disciplinary 
action that may be instituted against such official or employee.” 

 
14.3 Hereunder are the pertinent issuances related to the deadlines of submission 

of various mandatory reports:

14.4 As of February 14, 2021, the submission of financial reports and supporting 

documents/schedules by the Accounting Department of TUPM incurred 
significant delays ranging from two to 188 days, thus precluded the Audit 
Team to extensively perform audit procedures to validate the transactions 
and propose corresponding adjustments to correct the records. The details 
are as follows: 

 
Table 31. Delayed Submission of Various Financial Documents

Quarterly FSs Not yet submitted 35 - 220 

 
14.5 For TUPV, verification of entries reflected in the RCI as against the DVs 

submitted for CY 2020, showed that 47 DVs covering payments with a net 
amount of ₱7,894,388.47 were still not submitted. Inquiry from the 
Accountant revealed that some DVs were not submitted because the 
supporting documents are still being reviewed for completeness. 
 

1.1 However, in the processing of DV, at the time the Accounting Unit receives 
the DV and supporting documents from the Budget Unit, it should have 
already checked the completeness of the supporting documents, and upon 
finding that the same lacks the required documentation, it should be returned 
to the party concerned for compliance as provided in Section 12, Chapter 6 
of the GAM for NGAs, Volume I. 
 

14.6 The issuance of checks gives the presumption that it has already a duly 
approved DV and complete supporting documents. This is the reason why 
COA Circular No. 95-006 gives only ten (10) days after the end of each 
month for the agency to      comply with the submission. This is on the 
expectation that the DV will not be paid unless it has complete 
documentation. Thus, there could be no reason for the Accounting Unit to 
delay or not to submit the DVs on or before the due date. 
 

14.7 Non-submission of required financial reports/documents precluded the 
timely audit and prompt evaluation of the legality, validity and propriety of 
the disbursements. 

 



94 
 

14.8 We recommended that Management:  
 

Campus Recommendations 
TUPM • submit the financial reports and their supporting documents within the 

prescribed timelines to facilitate timely review of the financial 
transactions and prompt correction of errors and deficiencies found in 
audit, if any; and 
 

• implement Section 122 of PD No. 1445 on the withholding of salary of 
the officials and employees concerned, as warranted; 

TUPV • direct the head of the Accounting Unit to submit immediately the 
lacking DVs, within five days from  the receipt of this observation, 
complete with the relevant supporting documents, otherwise, said 
payment will be suspended in audit; and 
 

• see to it that all DVs  during the month as reflected in the Report of 
Checks Issued (RCI) and Report of Authority to Debit Account Issued 
(RADAI) be submitted completely, within 10 days after the end of each 
month. 

 
14.9 The Management commented, thus: 

 
Campus Comments 
TUPV The Management committed to submit the abovementioned vouchers to 

the Office of the Resident Auditor on or before June 30, 2021. 
 

14.10 Auditor’s Rejoinder 
1.2  

Campus Rejoinder 
TUPV The Management should ensure the submission of the subject DVs on the 

date committed in order to avoid suspension of salary of personnel 
concerned pursuant to Section 122 of PD No. 1445, as well as to avoid 
suspension of the subject transactions. 

 
 
Non-compliance with the Information and Publicity on Programs/Projects/Activities (PPAs) 
 
15. Incomplete/non-posting of relevant information on signboards/billboards on 

the project sites/conspicuous places of ongoing construction projects within the 
TUPM and TUPT campuses as of December 31, 2020 with an aggregate 
amount of ₱100,407,738.77 is contrary to COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated 
January 30, 2013, thus depriving the public of the right to public information 
on the essential elements of the PPAs being undertaken by the Agency. 

 
15.1 To promote good governance through transparency and accountability in 

implementing PPAs of government agencies and to support the right of the 



95 
 

people to information on matters of public concern, COA Circular No. 
2013-004 dated January 30, 2013 requires -  
 

Section 2.1 “At the beginning of the year, all government agencies shall provide 
their respective assigned Supervising Auditors (SAs) and Audit Team 
Leaders (ATLs) with a list of all on-going projects/program/activities 
(“PPAs”) and those that are to be implemented during the year. The 
list shall include the project name, implementing unit, office or 
division if it is not the agency as a whole; brief description of the 
PPA; contractor or supplier, if any; mode of procurement; funding 
source; cost or approved budget; project duration including start and 
completion dates; and location.  Other information on the PPA 
maybe requested by the SA or ATL anytime for audit purposes.” 

Section 2.2 “Notification to the public and other form of announcement and/or 
publicity for or otherwise relating to the PPA shall be made at the 
least possible cost, taking into account that the nature of and 
purposes of audit notification, announcement and/or publicity, is to 
inform the public of the essential features/elements of the PPA.”      

Section 4 “All expenses incurred in violation of this Circular shall be 
disallowed in Audit. Failure of the concerned agency to comply with 
any of the provisions of this circular shall be subject of 
administrative disciplinary action provided under Section 127 of 
Presidential Decree No. 1445 without prejudice to the filing of a 
criminal action, if warranted by existing laws.” 

 
15.2 It was observed that the information essential for publicity and transparency 

are either incomplete or no signboards/billboards were displayed on the 
project sites of ongoing construction projects within the TUPM and TUPT 
campuses totaling ₱100,407,738.77, contrary to Section 2.2 of the said 
Circular. Ongoing projects as of December 31, 2020 are shown below:

15.3 We recommended that Management of TUPM and TUPT strictly 
comply with the provisions set in COA Circular No. 2013-004 dated 
January 30, 2013 to prevent disallowance in audit. 
 

15.4 The Management commented, thus: 
 

Campus Comments 
TUPM The Management has submitted pictures evidencing that billboards were 

indeed posted in conspicuous places. 

TUPT The Chairman of Infrastructure Development Office (IDO) stated that 
billboards containing details for the construction projects were posted but 
due to winds and heavy rainfalls, these were damaged. And in response, 
IDO further said that it has already provided the billboards for all the on-
going infrastructure projects. 

 
15.5 The Audit Team noted, however, that the billboards posted in some of the 

infrastructure projects within the vicinity of TUPM were still incomplete as 
to the details such as the date of completion and contract cost. 

 
 
Compliance with RA No. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act 
 
16. Non-compliance with the rules and regulations on government procurement 

was observed, such as: a) payment of ₱2,147,648.71  mobilization fees in the 
absence of any form of security; b) non-conformity with the prescribed form 
and validity period for the performance bonds posted by winning bidders for 
₱15,233,160.97 infrastructure projects; c)  ₱4,885,691.67 procurements thru 
Shopping not  within  the conditions required to justify the usage of Shopping 
modality; d) ₱5,994,009.85  procurements under the alternative mode not 
supported by proof of the required postings for transparency;  e) absence of 
the Annual Procurement Plan (APP); and f) other deficiencies, thereby 
affecting the judicious and prudent utilization of government resources as well 
as the effective and efficient delivery of services to the stakeholders. 

 
16.1 RA No. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act and its IRR 

provide the framework in the procurement of goods and services and the 
contract implementation of infrastructure projects.  It provides uniformed 
and streamlined processes and documentary requirements designed to 
promote transparency in all phases of procurement while encouraging 
competitiveness among interested and qualified participants. 
 

16.2 Hereunder are the pertinent provisions of the General Provisions of GAA for 
FY 2020 related to government procurement: 
 
Section 17(a) “Purchase of goods, infrastructure projects, and consulting services, 

including common-use supplies shall be made in accordance with the 
provisions of RA No. 9184, its IRR and GPPB guidelines.” 
 



97 
 

Section 18 “Strict adherence to Procurement Laws, Rules and Regulations: All 
agencies of the government shall strictly adhere to the provisions of RA 
No. 9184, its IRR and Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) 
guidelines in the procurement of goods, infrastructure projects and 
consulting services.  x x x” 

Section 19 “Early Procurement Activities: Notwithstanding the mandatory 
procurement timelines under RA No. 9184 and its IRR, agencies are 
authorized to undertake early procurement activities as soon as the 
proposed national budget is submitted to Congress. However, agencies 
may only proceed with the issuance of notice of award of contract upon 
approval or enactment of their respective appropriations and issuance of 
budget authorization document and based on the amount authorized 
therein.  x x x” 

 
16.3 Audit on the procurement of various items/projects showed the following

an advance payment to the contractor in an amount not exceeding 
fifteen percent (15%) of the total contract price, to be made in 
lump sum or, at the most, two installments according to a schedule 
specified in the Instructions to Bidders and other relevant Tender 
Documents. 
 
 
4.2. The advance payment shall be made only upon the submission

standby letter of credit of equivalent value from a commercial 
bank, a bank guarantee or a surety bond callable upon demand, 
issued by a surety or insurance company duly licensed by the 
Insurance Commission and confirmed by the procuring entity.” 

 
Verification of the two infrastructure projects disclosed that advance 
payments were made totaling ₱2,147,648.71 without requiring them to 
post an advance payment security in the form of either an irrevocable 
standby letter of credit, bank guarantee or a surety bond callable upon 
demand, as shown below:

Inquiry from the Management disclosed that they believe that the posting 
of a Performance Bond satisfies the requirement for the advance payment 
security. That is, however, incorrect. The advance payment security and 



98 
 

Table 33. Deficiencies in Procurement under RA No. 9184 and its Revised IRR 
Deficiencies Particulars 

the performance security serve different purposes. The requirement for an 
advance payment security is to guarantee the reimbursement of the 
advance payments made by the Procuring Entity in the event that the 
contractor fails to comply with his obligations. While the purpose of the 
performance security is to guarantee the faithful performance of the 
obligations under the contract prepared in accordance with the bidding 
documents. 
 
Moreover, the advance payment security and performance security 
requires different amounts, in the case of the former, the IRR requires 
that it must be equivalent to the amount of the advance payment, while 
the performance security ranges from five to 30 percent of the contract 
price, depending on the form of security chosen by the contractor. 
 
Lastly, while the advance payment security is necessary only until the 
Procuring Entity recovers the advance payment from the progress 
payments made, the validity of the Performance Security should extend 
even beyond the final progress payment, specifically, until the issuance of 
the Certificate of Final Acceptance at the end of the defects liability 
period. 
 
In the projects determined above, the Management should have required 
the contractors requesting for advance payment to post a security 
equivalent to the amount of the advance payments made. Not imposing 
such requirement is prejudicial to government’s interest as it would be   
deprived of remedy in recovering the advance payment in case of default 
of the contractor. 
 
Advance payment made is disallowable in audit for being an irregular 
expenditure.

Deficiencies Particulars 

As shown in the table above, the surety bond already expired even before the 
earliest date that the Procuring Entity can issue the Certificate of Final 
Acceptance. Such situation is prejudicial to the government considering that 
the surety bond may no longer be enforced in the event the contractor 
defaults after the validity of the surety bond. 

• Non-compliance with 
the conditions 
required to justify the 
usage of Shopping 
modality of 
procurement totaling 
₱4,885,691.67 

Section 52 of the 2016 IRR of RA No. 9184 provides: 
 

Section 52. Shopping 
52.1. Shopping is a method of procurement of Goods whereby the 
Procuring Entity simply requests for the submission of price 
quotations for readily available off-the-shelf goods or 
ordinary/regular equipment to be procured directly from suppliers 
of known qualifications. This method of procurement shall be 
employed in any of the following cases: 

a) When there is an unforeseen contingency requiring 
immediate purchase: Provided, however, That the amount shall 
not exceed the thresholds prescribed in Annex “H” of this IRR. 
(₱200,000.00 for NGAs) 
b) Procurement of ordinary or regular office supplies and 
equipment not available in the Procurement Service involving 
an amount not exceeding the thresholds prescribed in Annex 
“H” of this IRR. (₱1,000,000.00 for NGAs) 
 

Audit validation showed that procurements totaling ₱4,885,691.67 were 
made using Shopping as the alternative mode of procurement. However, 
these were not supported by any evidence of the existence of conditions 
justifying the employment of this mode. 
 
It was further observed that in almost all of the DVs for the payment of 
procurements of the Agency, no copy of the Annual Procurement Plan (APP) 
was being attached to it, contrary to the provision of COA Circular No. 2012-
001 dated June 14, 2012, which requires the APP as one of the documentary 
requirements for disbursements relating to procurements regardless of the 
modality employed. This could have been one of the documents which will 
provide information to the Audit Team of the mode of procurement originally 
recommended by the BAC and approved by the Head of Agency. 

• Procurements under 
the alternative mode 
amounting to 
₱5,994,009.85 were 
not supported by 
proof of the required 
postings for 
transparency 

Section 54.2 and Item IV(L) (2), Annex H of the 2016 IRR of RA No. 9184 
provides: 
 

“Section 54.2 
 
For the following modalities, however, the BAC, through its 
Secretariat, shall post the invitation or request for submission of 
price quotations/proposals in the PhilGEPS website, the website of 
the Procuring Entity concerned, if available, and at any 
conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the premises of the 
Procuring Entity for a period of at least three (3) calendar days: 

1. Section 49 Limited Source Bidding; 
2. Section 52.1(b) Shopping for ordinary office supplies and 
equipment not available in DBM-PS (for ABC above Fifty 
Thousand Pesos (₱50,000.00)); 
3. Section 53.1 Two Failed Biddings; 
4. Section 53.9 Small Value Procurement (For ABC above 
Fifty Thousand Pesos (₱50,000.00)); and 
5. Section 53.11 NGO Participation.

Unless the contract involves and affects national security as

Guidelines, the BAC, through its Secretariat, shall post the NOA, 
Contract/PO, including the NTP if necessary, for information 
purposes, in the PhilGEPS website, the website of the Procuring 
Entity concerned, if available, and at any conspicuous place 
reserved for this purpose in the premises of the Procuring Entity 
within ten (10) days from their issuance, except for contracts with 
ABC of Fifty Thousand Pesos (₱50,000.00) and below.” 

 
Audit of DVs disclosed that no proofs of posting of Notice of 
Award/Purchase Order/Contract, including NTP were attached to 
disbursements amounting to ₱5,994,009.85. 
 

• Other procurement 
deficiencies 

The due date of delivery of the goods procured by the Agency cannot be 
clearly established 
 
Section 68 of RA No. 9184 states: 

“Liquidated Damages. – All contracts executed in accordance with 
this Act shall contain a provision on liquidated damages which 
shall be payable in case of breach thereof. The amount thereof 
shall be specified in the IRR.” (Emphasis added) 
 

Verification of the DVs showed the following deficiencies: 
 
• some Purchase Orders (PO) amounting to ₱557,050.00 do not bear the 

date of acceptance of the supplier; 
• procurements totaling ₱1,513,691.15 do not have a Delivery Receipt; 
• dates of delivery in the PO in the field provided for delivery term were 

incorrectly placed 
• there were also some superimposition and alterations in the date of 

delivery 
• procurements amounting to ₱669,050.00 do not have Inspection and 

Acceptance Reports (IARs) 
 

Observers were not invited to attend in all procurement stages of the 
construction of Covered Court at TUPV Sagay with a contract cost of 
₱915,497.79. 
 
It was observed that the BAC of TUPV was not able to invite observers in all 
procurement stages of the construction of Covered Court at TUPV Sagay, 
evidenced by a Certification issued by the BAC Chairman, that the BAC 
unintentionally overlooked the preparation of the invitation letters to the 
observers. 
 
The failure of the BAC to invite observers in this particular project even 
more render questionable the erasures made in the Abstract of Bids of the 
winning bidder. From the initial bid amount of ₱963,681.88, the same was 
crashed out and replaced by an amount of ₱915,497.79, way lower than the 
bid amount of the other bidder. Also, in the bid form which initially indicates 
the bid amount of ₱963,681.88, in figures and in words, a discount of five 
percent from the bid amount was afterwards indicated in handwriting, when

Non-adoption of measures to determine the imposable liquidated damages to 
the contractor of the project “Construction of Covered Court at TUPV 
Sagay” and paid it instead for the full contract price of ₱915,497.79 despite 
of its failure to complete the same within the contract period. 
 
Further verification of the aforesaid project revealed that TUPV did not 
impose liquidated damages for the delayed completion of the infrastructure 
project. 
 
As provided in the Contract entered into by TUPV and Bachoco 
Construction and Supply (Contractor), parties agreed that the Contractor 
shall commence the construction within ten (10) calendar days after receipt 
of written NTP, and complete it within sixty (60) calendar days therefrom. 
 
The Contractor received the NTP on July 24, 2019, thus it should have 
commenced the construction on August 3, 2019, and completed the same on 
October 2, 2019. However, as per progress billing of the Contractor dated 
October 28, 2019, the Contractor stated that the project was completed on 
October 28, 2019, or 26 days after the agreed completion date.

Ø not be in conflict with the required validity period of the IRR of 

RA No. 9184; 
Ø be supported by a project specific certification issued by the 

Insurance Commission in accordance with its own rules;

of the portion of the Annual Procurement Plan, highlighting which 
part of that plan pertains to the subject procurement;

Non-conformity with 
the prescribed form and 
validity period for the 
Performance Bonds 
posted by winning 
bidders for 
infrastructure projects 
totaling ₱15,233,160.97 

The BAC committed to evaluate the project as stated to remedy the 
absence of the Performance Bond. The BAC will exhaust all possible 
means to demand Performance Bond from the winning bidders if it is 
still within the defects liability period. The BAC admitted that the 
validity period of the Performance Bond covers only until project 
completion. 

Non-compliance with 
the conditions required 
to justify the usage of 
Shopping modality of 
procurement 

The Management explained that they have been observing the correct 
procedure for Shopping and alternative mode of procurement. However, 
the incorrect documentation from the Procurement Office created 
confusion. The Management inquired if they could still comply with the 
documentations and during the exit conference, they committed to 
submit proof that the subject procurements were not purchased using the 
Shopping modality. The BAC also agreed to use the standard PO based 
on the GAM for NGAs. 

Procurements under the 
alternative mode 
amounting to 
₱5,994,009.85 were not 
supported by proof of 
the required postings 
for transparency. 

The BAC explained to COA that the posting of the procurement projects 
for the alternative mode of procurement is now being observed by the 
BAC Secretariat. The posting in the PhilGEPs website of the Small 
Value Procurement was already in place late of 2018. During the exit 
conference, the Management replied that they can submit proof that there 
was posting in the PhilGEPs website. However, the posting in 
conspicuous places and in their own website was implemented by the 
Procurement Office only in 2021. 

Other procurement 
deficiencies 

• The Management commented that they unintentionally missed to send 
letters of invitation to at least three observers. They, however, assured 
that the subject procurement was done without bias or prejudice to any 
of the parties (suppliers, contractors) involved. Management admitted 
during the exit conference that they have missed this requirement on all 
procurement projects undertaken in CY 2019 and earlier. Management 
however explained that for projects undertaken in CY 2020 and 
onwards, invitation to observers is already in place. Management 
submitted proofs that they are already complying with this requirement 
in their subsequent procurement projects. 
 

• Moreover, the Management admitted that at the time the project was 
implemented, systems as to the monitoring and inspection of projects 
were not in place. Management agreed that it would be difficult to 
determine the liquidated damages as the projects were belatedly 
inspected after their completion. In this view, Management explained 
that some changes are already being implemented to solve this kind of 
problem such as the reconstitution of the Inspection Committee for 
infrastructure, as well as creation of an Infrastructure and Physical 
Facilities Development Committee to monitor the progress of every 
project

16.6 Auditor’s Rejoinder 
 

Deficiencies Rejoinder 
Non-compliance with the 
conditions required to 
justify the usage of 
shopping modality of 
procurement 

The Management’s explanation that the discrepancies were 
probably on the documentation is acknowledged, thus the Audit 
Team requires the Management to submit proof that the subject 
procurement was procured using the SVP modality and not through 
Shopping, if applicable.  
 
Likewise, submit the necessary documents depending on whether 
the procurement is under the Shopping or SVP modality to further 
evaluate whether the subject procurements are completely 
documented. 

Procurements under the 
alternative mode amounting 
to ₱5,994,009.85 were not 
supported by proof of the 
required postings for 
transparency 

The Audit Team requires the Management to submit proof of the 
required postings of the subject procurements in the PhilGEPs 
website.  

 
 
OTHER COMPLIANCE ISSUES 
 
Compliance with Gender and Development (GAD) Program 
 
17. Non-submission of the GAD Accomplishment Report for CY 2020 hindered 

the evaluation of the program and activities identified in the GAD Plan and 
Budget (GPB) and the reasonableness of the 2.73 percent budget allocated to 
address the gender sensitivity issues, contrary to COA Circular No. 2014-001 
dated March 18, 2014 and Section 31 of the General Provisions (GP) of RA No. 
11465, General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2020. 

 
17.1 Section 31 of the General Provisions of the GAA for FY 2020 requires that 

all agencies of the government shall: 
 
a. formulate a Gender and Development (GAD) Plan designed to address 

gender issues within their concerned sectors or mandate and implement 
the applicable provisions under RA No. 9710 or the Magna Carta for 
Women, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
Against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Philippine Plan for 
Gender-Responsive Development (1995-2025) and the Philippine 
Development Plan (2017-2022); 
 

b. the GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities which shall be 
at least five percent of their budgets.  For this purpose, activities 
currently being undertaken by agencies which relate to GAD or those 
that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic empowerment especially 
of marginalized women, protection, promotion, and fulfillment of human 
rights and practice of gender-responsive governance are considered 



106 
 

sufficient compliance with said requirement. Utilization of GAD budget 
shall be evaluated based on the GAD performance indicators identified 
by said agencies; and. 
 

c. the preparation and submission of the annual GAD Plan and 
Accomplishment Report shall be subject to the guidelines issued by the 
agencies concerned. 
 

17.2 The GAD Plan shall be integrated in the regular activities of the agencies, 
the budget for which shall be at least five percent of the Agency’s budget. 
For this purpose, activities currently being undertaken by agencies which 
relate to GAD or those that contribute to poverty alleviation, economic 
empowerments especially of marginalized women, protection, promotion, 
and fulfilment of women’s human rights, and practice of gender-responsive 
governance are considered sufficient compliance with said requirement. 
Utilization of the GAD budget shall be evaluated based on the GAD 
performance indicators identified by said agencies. 

 
17.3 COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 provides for the 

responsibility of the Auditee which states that “The Audited agency shall 
submit a copy of the Annual GAD Plan and Budget (GPB) to COA Audit 
Team assigned to the agency within five working days from the receipt of the 
approved plan from the PCW or their mother or central offices as the case 
maybe. Likewise, a copy of the corresponding Accomplishment Report shall 
be furnished the said audit Team within five working days from the end of 
January of the preceding year.” 

 
17.4 PCW-NEDA-DBM Joint Circular No. 2012-001 - Guidelines for the 

Preparation of Annual Gender and Development (GAD) Plans and Budgets 
and Accomplishment Reports to implement the Magna Carta of Women 
provides: “Agency GAD Focal Point Systems (GFPS) shall take the lead in 
mainstreaming gender in agency PAPs.  As such they shall coordinate the 
preparation of the agency GPB and the GAD AR, monitor its 
implementation and report on its results.  In the process, they shall provide 
technical assistance to offices or units within their agency on gender 
mainstreaming.  To enable them to perform their roles, it is important that 
GFPS members are provided with the required gender capacity, such as the 
application of gender analysis tools.” 
 

17.5 Deficiencies in the implementation of GAD are as follows:  
 

Table 34. TUP System Deficiencies in GAD Implementation 
Campus Deficiencies 
• GAD Budget less than five percent of the total appropriations  

TUPC The amount appropriated for GAD Fund for CY 2020 amounted to ₱3,765,792.00, 
representing only 2.98 percent of the total budget of ₱126,253,389.32, which is 
below the five percent mandatory requirement. The total amount utilized is 
₱1,622,750.13. 



107 
 

Table 34. TUP System Deficiencies in GAD Implementation 
Campus Deficiencies 
• Non-submission of GPB and/or GAD AR 

TUPM The GAD Focal Person did not submit the GAD Accomplishment Report for CY 
2020, hence the Audit Team could not evaluate the effectiveness of the program 
and the reasonableness of the allocated budget with regard to the gender issues 
identified. 
 
Verification of the submitted GPB showed the following:  
• there is generality of gender issues identified in all campuses giving doubt as to 

whether gender mainstreaming which results should be reflected in the Gender 
Mainstreaming Evaluation Framework (GMEF) was conducted by the Main 
Campus in all the TUP campuses as the basis in the identification of the gender 
issues and the eventual formulation of the plan and budget. 
 

• there would be differences on the courses of action applicable to each of the 
campuses, as planned activities may differ due to environment, priorities and 
other factors inherent in the campus.  It is also difficult to match the 
accomplishments vis-à-vis the targets set and to equate the budget spent as it 
was lumped in one amount.  

 
• the determination of compliance with the requirement of at least five percent of 

the agencies total budget appropriations to cover the implementation of the 
programs could not be determined as the campuses have separate set of books 
and were provided with separate budget within which to base the five percent 
required for GAD implementation. 

  
• there is no GAD database for all campuses which precluded the Audit Team 

from evaluating the procedures on the gender analysis undertaken in coming up 
with the common gender issues. 

 
Due to the non-submission of the GAD Accomplishment Report, the Audit Team 
could not evaluate the effectiveness of the course of actions implemented by the 
campuses and the reasonableness of the allocated budget to address the gender 
issues identified in the GPB provided by the Management with an aggregate 
amount of ₱21,700,000.00, which is equivalent to 2.73 percent of the total 
appropriation of the TUP-System of ₱795,549,572.00. 

 
17.6 We recommended that Management: 
 

a. submit the Report of Accomplishments for TUP-S as required in 
COA Circular No. 2014-001 dated March 18, 2014 and Section 31 of 
the GP of GAA for FY 2020; 
 

b. allot the five percent allocated for GAD Budget per Campus 
pursuant to the General Provision of the GAA for CY 2020; and 
 

c. formulate GPB that will address specific gender issues in all 
campuses that  are aligned with the University’s mandate  and  the 
Magna Carta for Women, the Philippine Plan for Gender-
Responsive Development (1995-2025) and other GAD related 



108 
 

issuances and conduct gender  mainstreaming to address gender 
issues and concerns. 

 
 
Compliance with the implementation of programs and activities related to Senior Citizens 
and Differently-abled Persons 
 
18. TUPT and TUPV have complied with Section 32, General Provisions (GP) of the 

GAA for FY 2020 on the implementation of the projects and activities that 
addressed the needs of Senior Citizens (SCs) and Persons with Disability (PWDs).  

 
18.1 Section 32, GP of the GAA for FY 2020 provides that:  

 
“All agencies of the government shall formulate plans, programs, and 
projects intended to address the concerns of senior citizens and persons 
with disability, insofar as it relates to their mandated functions and 
integrate the same in their regular activities. 
 
Moreover, all government infrastructures and facilities shall provide 
architectural or structural features, designs or facilities that will 
reasonably enhance the mobility, safety and welfare of persons with 
disability pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 and RA No. 7277.

Compliance with Tax Laws 
 
19. For CY 2020, TUPM, TUPT and TUPC have faithfully deducted from the salaries 

of its personnel the required taxes, premiums and remitted the same as well as the 
government share within the prescribed period to the concerned institutions or 
agencies. However, deficiencies were noted for TUPM and TUPV such as: a) there 
is still existing  balance requiring reconciliation in the books of TUPM amounting 
to ₱7,049,130.14 as at yearend and b) non-withholding of taxes by TUPV on 
payment made for the purchases of goods amounting to ₱1,377,291.15, 
contrary to Section 4.114(B) and 5.116 of BIR Revenue Regulations No. 2- 98 
dated May 17, 1998,  as amended and other relevant BIR issuances, thus cast 
doubt on the accuracy of Due to BIR account balance at yearend. 

 
19.1 Below are the pertinent provisions of BIR Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-

98 dated May 17, 1998: 
 
Section 2.58A.2a – “the withholding tax return, whether creditable or final, 
shall be remitted within 10 days after the end of each month except for taxes 
withheld for December which shall be remitted on or before January 25 of 
the following year.” 
 
Section 4.114(B) - “x x x the Chief Accountant, or any person holding 
similar position and performing similar function in national government 
offices, shall deduct and withhold the prescribed creditable value-added     tax 
before making any payment to seller of goods and services.” 
 
Section 5.116 – “bureaus, offices and instrumentalities of the government 
xxx making any money payment to private individuals, corporations, 
partnerships and/or associations are required to deduct and withhold the 
taxes due from the payees on account of such money payments.” 

 
19.2 BIR RR No. 11-2018 provides the pertinent provisions relative to the 

withholding of incomes taxes on compensation while BIR Revenue 
Memorandum Circular No. 23-2007 dated March 20, 2007 provides the 
clarifications on the computations on government money payments due or 
payable to suppliers of goods and/or services. 
 

19.3 BIR RR No. 1-2013 dated January 23, 2013 provides that the filing of return 
and payment of tax due should be on or before the 10th day following the 
month in which withholding was made, except for taxes withheld for the 
month of December of each year, which shall be filed on or before January 
15 of the succeeding year. 
 

19.4 Presented in Table 36 are the audit observations and the corresponding 
recommendations on the deficiencies on compliance of the different 
Campuses with the aforesaid BIR regulations:

Table 36. TUP System Deficiencies in Compliance with Tax Laws 
Campus Audit Observations Recommendations 
TUPM TUPM has withheld and remitted taxes both amounting to 

₱43,246,715.42 for CY 2020. It was noted, however, that 
it has still an existing balance in the GL and as posted in 
the FS amounting to ₱7,049,130.14 as at yearend. 

Require the Accounting 
Department to reconcile 
the difference between 
the recorded and 
reported balances of the 
account and remit the 
unremitted balance to 
the BIR pursuant to BIR 
RR Nos. 2-98, 11-2018, 
and 1-2013. 

TUPT TUPT has a total unremitted balance of ₱1,017,311.16 as 
of December 31, 2020, which conforms to the presented 
figures in their FSs. It was remitted in January 2021. 

 

TUPC TUPC has faithfully adhered/complied with BIR 
requirements during the year, as summarized below: 
 
Taxes Withheld and Remittances Amount 
From Supplier ₱83,034.59 
From Compensation 4,819,805.29

TUPV Audit of sampled DVs showed payments for purchases of 
goods totaling ₱1,377,291.15 without deducting the 
prescribed withholding taxes, as follows:

Non-deduction of withholding tax prevented the early 
collection of taxes that could have been used by 
government to defray the expenses for its programmed 
activities. 
 
Moreover, any person who has the duty to withhold and 
remit taxes, the Chief Accountant in case of NGAs, who 
fails or causes the failure to deduct and withhold any 
internal revenue taxes is made personally liable for 
additions to tax prescribed in Sec. 247 of the NIRC and 
may be found liable for fines and imprisonment (see 
4.114(E) and 5.116 (D)) 
 
Upon inquiry, the Accountant claims that the non-
deduction of the prescribed withholding taxes is with 
legal basis, however, as of writing, we have not yet 
received any legal justification to such action. 

Require the Accountant 
to provide as soon as 
possible the legal basis 
for the non-deduction of 
withholding taxes on the 
payments of the subject 
purchases. 



111 
 

19.5 The Management of TUPV replied that BIR Revenue Memorandum 
Circular (RMC) No. 5-2006 provides exemptions on casual purchases. 
They, however, committed to impose withholding taxes on all government 
purchases. 
 

19.6 Auditor’s Rejoinder 
 
Upon review of the legal basis mentioned by the Management, RMC No. 5-
2006 nowhere provides for such exemption on casual purchases. RMC No. 
5-2006 prescribes the use of the Government Money Payment Chart for the 
computation of taxes withheld at source on the sale of goods and services to 
the government or to any of its political subdivisions whether subject to 
Creditable Withholding Tax, Final VAT and Percentage Tax. 
 
Moreover, the Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2020 
showed Due to BIR balance amounting to ₱660,195.71, which was not 
reflected in the schedule of taxes withheld. 
 
The Accountant likewise confirmed that these are unreconciled balances and 
reconciliation efforts are being undertaken to correct the reported balances. 

 
 
Compliance with RA No. 8291 on proper deductions and remittances of GSIS premiums 
 
20. TUPM, TUPT, TUPC, and TUPV complied with the provision of RA No. 8291. 

However, there is still an existing balance that requires reconciliation with the 
GSIS in the Due to GSIS account of TUPM amounting to ₱3,290,244.39, thereby 
affecting the accuracy of the aforesaid account in the FS as at yearend. 
 
20.1 Section 63(b), Rule II of RA No. 8291 requires that “each employer shall remit 

directly to the GSIS the employees’ and employers’ contributions within the 
first 10 days of the calendar month following the month to which the 
contributions apply.  Likewise, Section 3.6 provides that when authorized by the 
employee, the employer shall deduct from his monthly compensation, optional 
life insurance premiums, pre-need monthly installments, loan amortizations 
and such other amount due to the GSIS from the employee.  These amounts 
shall be remitted to the GSIS within the first 10 days of the calendar month 
following to which the deductions were effected.” 
 

20.2 Below is the status of  compliances with GSIS Law (RA No. 8291) of the 
different Campuses:

of National Health Insurance Act of 2013 and PhilHealth Circular No. 001, s. 2014 
on the remittance of all withheld premiums to PhilHealth as of December 31, 
2020.  However, there is still reported balance in the FSs that requires 
reconciliation for Due to PhilHealth account amounting to ₱3,290,244.39, which 
represents contributions withheld from employees of TUPM, thereby affecting the 
fair presentation of the aforesaid account in the FSs. 
 
21.1 Section 18 of the Revised IRR of the National Health Insurance Act of 2013 

(RA No. 7875, as amended by RA Nos. 9241 and 10606) requires that “the 
monthly contributions of employed members shall be remitted by the employer 
on or before the date prescribed by the Corporation.”  It further provides that 



113 
 

“failure and/or refusal of the employer to deduct or remit the complete 
employees’ and employer’s premium contribution shall not be a basis for 
denial of a properly filed claim. In such a case, the Corporation shall be 
entitled to reimbursement of claims paid from the erring or negligent employer, 
without prejudice to the latter’s prosecution and other liabilities, as may 
hereafter be provided in the said rules.” 
 

21.2 Related to this, PhilHealth Circular No. 001 s. 2014 dated January 4, 2014 has 
issued the revised payment schedule effective March 2014 onwards for all 
government and private employers, as shown in Table 38:
