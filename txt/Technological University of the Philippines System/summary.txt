EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

A. Introduction  
 

The Technological University of the Philippines (TUP) was established in 1901 
under Organic Act No. 74 of the Philippine Commission and was known as Manila Trade 
School originally housed near Ateneo de Manila in the historic Intramuros.  In 1910, it 
was renamed as Philippine School of Arts and Trades (PSAT).  With its rising 
population, the PSAT was given by the National Government a campus site in 1916, 
measuring a little less than three hectares at Calle San Marcelino, Ermita, Manila, its 
present location.  The PSAT was converted into the Philippine College of Arts and 
Trades (PCAT) on July 17, 1959, by virtue of Republic Act (RA) No. 2237.  From 1959 
to 1978, it pioneered programs in engineering technology and industrial teacher 
education.  On July 11, 1978, it was transformed into a state university and was named 
Technological University of the Philippines (TUP) pursuant to Presidential Decree (PD) 
No. 1518.  

 
The TUP-System is composed of four Campuses located in Manila, Taguig, 

Cavite, and Visayas.  
 
The TUP-Manila is the nucleus of the University. The Campus is located along 
Ayala Boulevard corner San Marcelino St., Ermita, Manila. Presently, the Main 
Campus has six Colleges, namely: College of Engineering, College of Industrial 
Technology, College of Industrial Education, College of Architecture and Fine 
Arts, College of Science, and College of Liberal Arts. Also, it has one research 
center which is the Integrated Research and Training Center or IRTC. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The TUP-Taguig Campus is the main provider of technology education in the 
southeastern part of Metro Manila providing engineers, technicians and skilled 
workers for the industries in the area. 
 
The TUP-Cavite Campus is located in Barangay Salawag, Dasmariñas, Cavite. 
The Campus was established through Board Resolution No. 1985, s. 1979. The 
Cavite Campus was established with the primary aim of responding to the need 
for an affordable quality technology education of the resettled squatters and the 
local settlers in the area. At present, the TUP-Cavite has transformed into a well-
recognized institution of higher learning in the field of technology education. 
 
The TUP-Visayas was established in 1977 as one of the three prototype 
technician institutes/projects of the National Government. TUP-Visayas was then 
known as the Visayas Technician Institute (VTI). In 1985, the VTI was renamed 
the Technological University of the Philippines-Visayas. Today, TUP-Visayas is 
one of the top providers of engineering education in the country, producing 
topnotchers in licensure examinations.

In addition to the four Campuses, the TUP administers the TUP-Municipality of 
Lopez, Quezon/Lopez Municipal Institute of Technology- a consortium, pursuant 
to a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Government of Lopez, Quezon 
and the Educational Institute for the constituents of Cuenca, Batangas.  TUP 
Cuenca, Batangas started as an extension and linkage program and was put to 
operation by virtue of the MOA executed by and between the TUP, the Local 
Government of Cuenca, Batangas and the Bagong Sigla ng Batangas, Inc. on 
October 11, 2010 and was confirmed by the Board of Regents (BOR) on March 
18, 2011, through BOR Resolution No. 07, s. 2011.  

 
Being the flagship of technological education in the country, it is committed to: 
 
Ø provide higher and advanced vocational, technical, industrial, technological 

and professional education and training in the industries and technology and 
practical arts leading to certificates, diploma and degrees; 
 

Ø provide progressive leadership in applied research, developmental studies in 
technical, industrial and technological field and production using indigenous 
materials; and 

 

Ø  

Ø effect technology transfer in the countryside and assist in the development of 
small-and-medium scale industries in identified growth centers. 

 
 The TUP-System is governed by the BOR composed of key stakeholders of the 

University. The Board is chaired by the Commissioner of the Commission on Higher 
Education (CHED) and vice-chaired by the University President, Dr. Jesus Rodrigo F. 
Torres.  The members of the BOR are represented by various sectors in the country, 
which include the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Education, Arts and Culture, the 
Chairman of the House Committee on Higher and Technical Education and Culture, the 
Director of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), the Assistant Secretary 
of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), two representatives from 
the private sector and the two presidents of the Federation of Associations in TUP 
composed of the Faculty and Alumni Federation.

D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the review of accounts and operations of the TUP-System for 
CY 2020 in accordance with the International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions 
(ISSAIs). The audit was conducted to: (a) verify the level of assurance that may be placed 
on Management’s assertions on the financial statements; (b) determine the propriety of 
transactions as well as the extent of compliance with applicable laws, rules and 
regulations; and (c) determine the extent of implementation of prior years’ audit 
recommendations. 
 
E. Auditor’s Report on the Financial Statements 

 
The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of the 

financial statements of the TUP-System for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to 
significant misstatements noted in audit as stated in the Independent Auditor’s Report and 
discussed in Part II of this Report. 

 
F. Summary of Significant Audit Observations and Recommendations 

 
The following are the significant audit observations with the corresponding 

recommendations which are discussed in detail in Part II of this report: 
 
1. Total misstatements amounting to ₱149,506,595.99 were found in Cash and Cash 

Equivalents, Receivables, Inventories, Property, Plant and Equipment, Other 
Assets and Liabilities accounts of the TUP-System  due to various accounting 
errors and omissions, thus affecting the fair presentation of the financial 
statements (FSs) as at December 31, 2020. (Observation No. 1) 

 
We recommended that Management of the concerned Campuses prepare the   
necessary adjustments to reflect the correct balances of the  Cash and Cash 
Equivalents, Receivables, Inventories, PPE, Other Assets, Liabilities and 
other affected accounts 

 



viii 
 

2. CIB-LCCA balance of ₱860,435,424.19 is of doubtful  accuracy  due to  
incomplete/non-submission of Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS). Further, 
audit of Cash NT-MDS disclosed over recording of the receipt of Notices of Cash 
Allocation (NCAs) and variances in the amounts reported in the Report of Advice 
to Debit Account Issued (RADAI), Report of Disbursements (FAR No. 4) and 
Report of Checks Issued and RADAI, totaling ₱30,105,951.71. (Observation No. 
2) 

 
We recommended that Management: 

a. submit the BRS within three months to the Audit Team, together with all 
the supporting documents, of all the bank accounts of the University in 
accordance with Sections 5 and 7, Chapter 21 of the GAM for NGAs, 
Volume I; 

b. coordinate with the LBP to facilitate the delivery of the BSs, and 
eventually for the timely preparation and submission of BRS to the Audit 
Team. If circumstances dictate that the BSs cannot be provided 
immediately, request for snapshots of bank accounts at least within seven 
(days) after the end of each month to avoid significant delays or non-
submission of BRS; 

c. submit the BRS since CY 2016 to the Audit Team, within three months 
from receipt hereof,  and in case of non-submission, impose the 
withholding of salaries of the officials and employees concerned until they 
shall have complied with the requirement, pursuant to the provision of 
Section 122 of PD No. 1445; 

d. explain the variances noted between the Report of Advice-to-Debit 
Account Issued (RADAI) and Bank Statement (BS) amounting to 
₱1,000.00 and Report of Disbursements (Financial Accountability Report 
No. 4) and Report of Checks Issued/RADAI amounting to ₱28,304,951.71 
and reflect the correct figures in the concerned reports, if warranted; 

e. carefully recognize the receipt of NCAs for proper accounting of the 
status thereof and be accurate in the reporting of cash allocations to 
prevent variances of figures in related reports. 

3. The  Receivables account balance of ₱458,145,485.78 is unreliable due to a) 
misclassification of account in recognizing the billing of TUPT for the 3rd term of 
the  Academic Year (AY) 2019-2020 as well as the payment for the 2nd term AY 
2019-2020 amounting to ₱15,029,895.00 and ₱14,698,340.00, respectively, under 
Accounts Receivable instead of Due from Central Office account; b) lack/absence 
of internal control system for the effective and efficient implementation of 
programs under the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education (UAQTE); c) 
non-maintenance of a separate bank account for the Free Higher Education 
(FHE), Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) and Student Loan Program ; and  d) 
inadequacy in the maintenance of Subsidiary Ledger (SL), thus runs counter with 



ix 
 

the provisions of  RA No. 10931 or the “UAQTE Act of 2017.” (Observation No. 
3) 

  
We recommended that Management: 

a. reclassify the amount of ₱15,029,895.00 pertaining to 3rd term of AY 
2019-2020 as well as the ₱14,698,340.00 payment for the 2nd term of the 
same AY that were erroneously recorded in the Accounts Receivable 
account; 

 
b. create policies and procedures that set forth the functions and 

responsibilities of each committee member, the deadline of submission for 
other campuses as well as the suggested pro forma entries in recording 
the FHE transactions; 

 
c. maintain separate bank account each for the FHE, TES and SLP as 

required in the MOA dated June 13, 2018; and 
 
d. maintain SLs for each of the three agencies (DBM, CHED, DPWH) to 

properly monitor their balances. 
 

4. The correctness of the Liabilities account balance at yearend of ₱362,897,957.92 
is unascertained due to: a) delayed liquidation of funds transferred ranging from 
16 to 311 days amounting to ₱15,841,000.00, which cannot be ascertained if 
already expended /distributed to TES and TES –Expanded Students’ Grant-in-Aid 
Program for Poverty Alleviation (ESGP-PA) beneficiaries for the AY 2018-2019 
due to absence of documents; and b) inconsistencies of balances reflected in 
various records. (Observation No. 7) 

 
We recommended that Management: 

 
TUPM 
a. immediately distribute allowances to the student-grantees and provide 

proof that the allowance were transferred if thru Automated Teller 
Machine (ATM) and payroll report signed by the recipients if thru cash 
advance; 

 
b. make formal letters with CHED-UniFAST Coordinator to follow up any 

pending results of assessment and/or to be regularly informed if payment 
of TES scholarship for any particular semester has already been 
transferred to the University; and 

 
c. strictly comply with Section XVI of JMC No. 04, s.2020 on the liquidation 

of funds transferred. 
 
 
 



x 
 

TUPT 
d. reconcile the disbursements posted in the GL and ChkDJ and reflect the 

appropriate balances. 
 

5. Deficiencies in the management/administration of the STF were noted such as: a) 
non-compliance with CHED Memorandum No 20, s. 2011 as shown by i) absence 
of details on the provision for Common Fund amounting to ₱20,000,000.00, ii) 
non-observance of the prescribed allocation of tuition fees that resulted in excess 
allocation of ₱28,309,300.00,iii) improper utilization of Curriculum Development 
allocation for honoraria to pay the salaries totaling P7,102,905.33 of part-time 
faculty professors without duly approved contracts and iv) unutilized Capital 
Outlay Budget for Current and Continuing STF in the total amount of 
₱291,778,865.99,thus affecting the delivery of services for the modernization, 
improvement, and upgrading of equipment and facilities; b) non-adherence to the 
policy on realignments on Current and Continuing STF pursuant to BOR 
Resolution No. 29, s. 2014; and c) payment of Personnel Assistance and Welfare 
Fund amounting to ₱300,000.00, contrary to Section 4(d) of RA No. 8292. 
(Observation No. 12) 
 
We recommended that Management: 

 
a. provide details for the allocated common fund amounting to 

₱20,000,000.00 to specific budgetary allocation for 
thrust/program/activity provided in Sections 6 to 17 of CMO No. 20, s. 
2011, if there is any; 

 
b. adhere to the prescribed allocations in the utilization of Tuition Fees as 

provided in Section 6 of CMO No. 20, s. 2011; 
 
c. assess/revisit the University’s policy on the assignment/granting of 

teaching loads to regulate/limit the disbursements of honoraria for 
overload that are aligned within the prescribed allocation set forth in 
CMO No. 20, s. 2011; 

 
d. provide justification on the low utilization of budget allocated to Capital 

Outlay by submitting status of implementation of the infrastructure 
projects identified under the Current and Continuing STF; 

 
e. enhance the procurement planning by considering the effect of the 

pandemic and the pertinent guidelines issued by concerned government 
agencies vis-à-vis procurement timelines to formulate a well-defined work 
in order to achieve the timely and full implementation of the targeted 
programs, projects and activities;   

 
f. adhere to the provisions on realignment in accordance with BOR 

Resolution No. 29, s. 2014 dated October 7, 2014; and 



xi 
 

g. provide legal basis for the use of STF (Fund164) for other personnel 
benefits particularly for medical assistance, otherwise, the same will be 
disallowed in audit. 

 
The aforementioned audit observations and recommendations were 

communicated through Audit Observation Memoranda and discussed with Agency 
Officials in an Exit Conference, via Zoom, conducted on May 20, 2021 and their 
comments were considered in this Report, where appropriate. 

G. Status of Settlement of Audit Suspensions and Disallowances 
 
Audit Suspensions and Disallowances amounting to ₱6,505,035.17 and 

₱37,792,891.97, respectively, remained unsettled as at December 31, 2020, details of 
which are discussed in Part II of this Report. 

 
H. Status of Implementations of Prior Years’ Audit Recommendations  

 
Of the 215 prior years’ audit recommendations, 70 were implemented and 145 

were not implemented as summarized in the table below, the details of which are shown 
in Part III of this report.
