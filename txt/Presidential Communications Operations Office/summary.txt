D. Scope of Audit 
 

The audit covered the accounts and operations of PCOO for CY 2020.  It was 

conducted to: a) ascertain the level of assurance that may be placed on the 

Management’s assertion on the financial statements; b) determine the propriety of 

transactions as well as extent of compliance on the applicable laws, rules and 

regulations; c) recommend agency’s improvement opportunities; and d) determine 

the extent of implementation of prior year’s audit recommendations.  Moreover, the 

audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit 

Institutions (ISSAIs). 

 

 

E. Auditor’s Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 

The Auditor rendered a qualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of 

the financial statements of PCOO as at December 31, 2020 due to the observations 

enumerated on the next page: 
       

 



iv 

 

1. The 800 copies of coffee table books acquired by PCOO for distribution to 
other government agencies totaling P2 million were not accounted in the 

books upon delivery and were recorded as outright expense upon payment that 

resulted in the misstatement of the balance of the affected asset and expense 

accounts, and non-reporting in the financial statements of the undistributed 

342 copies amounting to P855,000.00 at year-end. (Observation No. 1) 

 

2. Computer software and operating systems (OS) worth P6,950,966.00 were 
erroneously recorded as Information and Communication Technology 

Equipment (ICTE), thus, were depreciated with residual value of at least five 

percent, contrary to Chapter 12, Volume I of the Government Accounting 

Manual (GAM) providing that intangible assets shall be amortized with zero 

residual value.  Moreover, obsolete and expired computer software with total 

cost of at least P987,500.00 were not derecognized in the books. These 

deficiencies resulted in the misstatement of the balances of the accounts 

Computer Software, ICTE and related depreciation.  (Observation No. 2) 

 

 

F. Summary of Other Significant Observations and Recommendations 
 

The following are the other significant audit observations and the 

corresponding recommendations. 
 

1. The Due from GOCCs account’s balance amounting to P83,641,281.91 is 
unreliable as the there was no corresponding balance of unliquidated fund 

transfer in the books of the implementing agency, the People’s Television. 

Network, Inc. (PTNI), based on confirmation from its Resident Auditor 

caused by non-reconciliation of records. (Observation No. 3) 

 

We recommended and Management agreed to require the Accountant to 

closely coordinate with the Accountant of the PTNI to reconcile the records 

of the inter agency fund transfer, and thereafter prepare the necessary journal 

entry as applicable.   

 

2. Expenses totaling P12,374,291.16 paid out of the funds received from other 
agencies were not recognized in the PCOO’s books of accounts but were 

recorded, instead, as a direct charge to the Due to NGAs account, contrary to 

Annex M, Volume I, GAM for National Government Agencies (NGAs). 

(Observation No. 4) 

 

We recommended that Management direct the Accounting Division to 

properly record the transactions involving inter-agency transferred funds in 

accordance with the journal entries prescribed in the GAM. 

 

3. Unserviceable properties totaling P4,928,817.22 remained undisposed at 
year-end contrary to Section 79 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, thus, 



v 

 

denying the government of potential income, in case of sale.  However, the 

unserviceable properties were not specifically identified in the Report on the 

Physical Count of Property Plant and Equipment (RPCPPE) while the 

Inventory and Inspection Report of Unserviceable Property (IIRUP) was not 

updated. (Observation No. 5) 

 

We recommended that Management require: 

 

a)     The Inventory Committee to: (i) specifically identify the reported 
unserviceable properties; and (ii) henceforth, properly accomplish the 

RPCPPE ensuring that the required information/data are provided 

therein; 

b)     The Property Officer to update the IIRUP to include all unserviceable 
properties; and 

c)     The Disposal Committee to immediately undertake the proper 
disposition of unserviceable properties. 

 

4. PCOO engaged the services of a private lawyer without the written 
conformity and acquiescence of the Solicitor General and the written 

concurrence of the Commission, and despite having a legal office, in 

violation of COA Circular no. 95-011 dated December 4, 1995, thus, related 

expenditures were considered irregular and unnecessary. (Observation No. 6) 

 

We recommended that Management: 

 

a)     Hold the concerned agency officials who signed/approved the COS, 
approved the payments, and certified as to the necessity and lawfulness 

of the expenses and completeness of supporting documents liable for 

the refund of salaries of the private lawyer in view of the noted 

deficiencies; and 

b)     Ensure that the requirements and other conditions under COA Circular 
No. 95-011 are complied with before engaging the services of a private 

lawyer.  

 

5. The implementation of activities under the Memorandum of Agreement 
(MOA) between the PCOO and Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) as well 

as the utilization of the PSA transferred funds for the PhilSys project were 

with deficiencies as follows: (a) fund received from PSA amounting 

toP93,900,000.00 had been idle for more than one year due to the non-

transfer of funds to PIA and PTNI, and the non-implementation of the 

planned  activities for Mainstream Media such as media placements in Top 

TV, radio stations and others; (b) PCOO has yet to hire personnel for the 

Monitoring Division of the PCOO PhilSys Project Team; hence submission 

of required  reports by the Implementing Agencies (IAs) was not being 

closely monitored; and (c) the related Report of Disbursements (RDs) 

submitted to the Audit Team were not supported with documents; thus, 



vi 

 

validity of expenditures charged against the PSA transferred funds could not 

be ascertained. (Observation No. 7) 

 

We recommended that Management require the Chief Accountant to: 

 

a)     Immediately submit the necessary documents to support the reported 

disbursements charged against the PSA transferred funds; and 

b)     Henceforth, ensure that the succeeding RDs to be submitted to the Audit 
Team are supported with proper documentary requirements. 

 

6. PCOO hired a total of 375 COS personnel in CY 2020 which was 260.42 per 
cent way above the total number of its regular employees. However, the 

necessity of hiring such number of COS personnel, for which a total amount 

of P70,688,830.39 was spent by PCOO for their salaries, could not be 

established due to absence of the agency’s written policy guidelines on 

availing the services of COS personnel, justification for the need to hire those 

COS personnel and incomplete documentation of DVs. (Observation No. 8)   

 

We recommended that Management:  

 

a.   Submit justification for the hiring of 375 COS personnel; 
b.   Assess its existing organizational structure so that the ideal number of 

plantilla items/positions could be established, thereby, avoiding the 

hiring of excessive number of COS personnel;  

c.   Develop a written policy guideline on the hiring of individuals under 
COS clearly defining the conditions whereby employment of such COS 

personnel may be availed of; 

d.   Evaluate the need for the services of COS and ensure that hiring of COS 
personnel shall be resorted to based on necessity and exigency of the 

service, and refrain from hiring COS whose functions are redundant to 

the functions of existing regular agency employees;   

e.   Consider those qualified COS for appointment to the vacant regular 
plantilla positions in the agency; and  

f.   Require the COS to provide details of the actual duties/tasks 
accomplished in the monthly accomplishment report to facilitate proper 

evaluation.   

 

The above findings and recommendations were communicated to 

Management officials concerned through Audit Observation Memorandum 

(AOMs). Management views and comments were considered in the report, where 

appropriate. The details of the above observations were discussed in Part II of this 

report.
